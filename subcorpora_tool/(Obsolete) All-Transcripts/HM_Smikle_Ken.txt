Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please spell your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Ken Smikle, well the full name is Kenneth Albert Smikle.  And I'm putting that in because I need to disprove to my brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] I'm not a junior (laughter).  I'm named after my dad, Kenneth Raymond Smikle [Kenneth Smikle].  And I go by Ken Smikle, S-M-I-K-L-E, is the last name.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind that name?  That's an unusual name in the black community?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--we have--we've tried to get as much as we can on the origin of it.  There are lots of them, lots of Smikles in Jamaica.  My father used to say most of them are bankers or thieves.  My mother [Mary Dobbins Smikle] used to say what's the difference (laughter).  But I think the origin of the name and nationality is German as best as we can tell.  I have a cousin, Myra Henry, who is the person responsible for tracking down leads like that.  And that's as much as we've ever gotten on it, the little bit that she picked up from our grandmother [Pearl Smikle Simington].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 3rd, 1952, born in Columbia Presbyterian Hospital [New York-Presbyterian Hospital] in New York City [New York, New York].  And by some stretch of the imagination Harlem or what used to be called Spanish Harlem [East Harlem, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Entrepreneur.  I'm a publisher, editor and publisher currently of Target Market News, which is an online news and information service.  And also a Black Issues Book Review which is a seven year old nationally distributed black magazine covering the works of African American authors and books of interest to African Americans.  I just recently acquired that company in March 2006.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: What is today's date (laughter), I was in Chicago [Illinois].  I was in New York, Cambridge.  Today is I--I--today is December 15, 2007 [sic.].
Speaker 1: And '6 [2006].
Speaker 2: Ah '6 [2006], year's over, I'm already onto the next thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You--you're preparing yourself for what the next--for a month from now.
Speaker 2: I'm onto the next year.
Speaker 1: But, yeah, and where are we at the present time, you don't have to give your address necessarily, but where are we?
Speaker 2: We're at our home of the last nineteen years on Greenwood Avenue in Hyde Park, Chicago.
Story_ID: 588224
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions that I am compelled by management to ask.
Speaker 2: Oh, don't apologize.
Speaker 1: And they only (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm a magazine editor so I've great appreciation for these little nuance things.
Speaker 1: These questions only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food and what is it?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm laughing because there's one dish that I prepare really, really well, so it must be my favorite dish, which is--salmon and pasta.  Yeah, I like it a lot.
Speaker 1: Now, now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I guess it switched, it--it used to be green, but I'm thinking blue.  Maybe that's my problem, I need to be thinking green more.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, autumn, fall, without a doubt.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I really did love going to New Orleans [Louisiana] and we haven't been since Katrina [Hurricane Katrina].  But I'd say other than that, the one trip that I made to Paris [France], loved it too.  So I think those two, at least in my imagination.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fulfill that.
Speaker 1: The last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Favorite phrase, well I guess the phrase that I say most often when--when I greet folks and they say, "How are you?" I say, "It's your world, I'm just waiting for instructions."  (Laughter) So I guess I don't know where I got it from.  But it just seemed to fit.  You know, it is your world and I am waiting for instructions.  I--I like the service and the humor sort of aspects of that.
Story_ID: 588225
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Kenneth Smikle] side.  We'll start with your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Good (laughter).
Speaker 1: Can--can you give us--can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My mother's full name as we have known it to be for all of my life or most of my life was Mary Alice Dobbins, D-O-B-B-I-N-S [Mary Dobbins Smikle].  And the Dobbins family was a very large one.  She was born at West Point, Mississippi.  And she was the last of nine children.  And her mother, Mamie Boatman, passed when she was just seven years old.  So the other family members that were older raised the, the, the children that were younger.  So she was the perpetual baby of the family and everybody got to raise her.
Speaker 1: Now what's her date of birth?
Speaker 2: You gonna give me, I meant to double check the year.
Speaker 1: You can get us close.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it's March 9th, and she passed away two years ago and, and oh, you got me Larry [Larry Crowe], I forget the exact date of birth.  You know what, I can--I'll check it later.
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenties [1920s] or '30s [1930s]?
Speaker 2: I should get it--I should get it on the break.
Speaker 1: Somewhere in the 1920s or '30s [1930s] I think, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well she was eighty when she died, yeah.  And she died last year, so that would be like the 1920s.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think 1922 probably, I mean from calculating from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we gotta get it on the record.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm an editor, we gotta nail that fact down.
Story_ID: 588226
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace her side of the family? And--
Speaker 2: Well, (pause) we actually--and it's funny because we're a family, especially on my mother's [Mary Dobbins Smikle] side, that--that is full of stories.  I mean we grew up going to, to, to family dinners in which we heard, as kids, these stories about who did what and who traveled where for, you know, decades.  And--but no one has ever written it down.  And I've always felt like I should've been the one to do that.  But, you know, it's again like one of those things.  So their, their actual history is known to people and my Aunt Louise, Louise Dobbins and then Louise Green [Louise Dobbins Green (ph.)], is the last of--last living person from the family. (Clears throat) Excuse me.  And all we know about the family and what it was is contained in the stories that came out of West Point [Mississippi].  Now I have older--and since my mother was the last of the line, I have cousins that are older than me who were able to have better recollections of, of the people and the stories from the family.  My co- my cousins are the ones who really know in detail what life was like in West Point for them.
Speaker 1: Are there stories that come--go all the way back to slavery days or?
Speaker 2: Not that I've heard.  I don't--I have to the best of my recollection have never heard anything about our maternal grandparents.  Because again, we were--we were the last in the line.  And it just, I don't think it was known.  I never heard my mother talk about what her grandfather did.  We have, you know, just little vague references about who they were, what they did.
Speaker 1: Were, were they town people or did they farm, or what did they do?
Speaker 2: They were town people for the most part.  My grandfather, Henry Boatman, had a, a like a little general store that he operated in West Point.  And, and the grandmo- my grandmother, my wife's mother [sic. maternal grandmother, Mamie Boatman], was just a housewife who had quite--a fair size family that she came from in Corinth, Mississippi and surrounding areas of West Point.  So we don't have a lot about what constituted life for them, what their families were like.
Speaker 1: Well, they, they talk about, you know, it must've been interesting being a black entrepreneur in Mississippi in those days, I mean, so I could imagine there were some challenges there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought.  You know, I had this--this fantasy of learning about my entrepreneurial grandfather and like give me the details.  But they were--they were very few and far between in terms of the details.  Yeah, for the most part folks just remember the incidences of everyday life.  The interaction with other blacks and whites in the West Point community.
Speaker 1: Did whites patronize the store?
Speaker 2: As far as I know, yeah.  I mean that was what I was told, put it that way.  Don't have much about the interaction specifically with them in the community.  There were whites in the community that they were friendly with and as you say, there were folks that they interacted with regularly with the--with the, the commerce that he was doing.  But don't have much of an idea at all really about the history there and you know, what happened to the business and did it die with him.  Most of the--all of the children left West Point and went north, mostly to St. Louis [Missouri] and to New York [New York].  I have one uncle who--who was the oldest, who just traveled.  You know, he, he literally hopped on the freight trains and (gesture) took off.  And he was the--always the adventurous one in the family.  And that was Ted [Ted Dobbins (ph.)].  And they, we've always been clustered around the brothers and sisters of my, my mom.  They went to New York so, two or three of them went to New York, the rest went to St. Louis. East St. Louis [Illinois] I should say.
Story_ID: 588227
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Mary Dobbins Smikle] grow up in West Point [Mississippi] or did she--and go to school there before she moved to New York [New York] or did she--she?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she--you're right--she--she lived her childhood in West Point, went to school there, like you said, and didn't go to New York until she was almost in her twenties, very, very late teens is best recollection I have about when she actually went north and her, sister Louise [Louise Dobbins Green (ph.)], was already there.
Speaker 1: You know, there's a (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Aunt Flora [Flora Dobbins (ph.)], I should say Aunt Flora was also in New York.
Speaker 1: Well Chicago [Illinois], as you well know, is--has a lot of Mississippi immigrants in it (laughter).  And you know, there's a West Point Baptist Church [West Point Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] and I'm sure it's not named after the--the Army academy, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah the Military Academy [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York].
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I imagine it's got something to do with West Point, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yeah and I'm sure that's true.  I always thought it was odd that we, we had no Chicago roots.  We had no relatives in Chicago.
Speaker 1: That is from Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for as large a family as she came from, none of them came here.  My Aunt Louise was here for a minute, but to--after her mother died.  But yeah, for the most part, I'm the one that moved any part of our family into Chicago.  And you know, given Chicago's history, culture, people, it's amazing we didn't get here before twenty years ago.
Speaker 1: Yeah this is a Mississippi town in terms of the black population here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So I don't know how intentional that was (laughter), and I know my--my Uncle Ted [Ted Dobbins (ph.)] talks about coming to Chicago visiting, not staying very long at all.  But, yeah wasn't--when I first--and because we had no family here, the first time that I ever stepped foot in Chicago was in '85 [1985] and had always wanted to come here because Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] was here, because Charles Stepney and [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis and a host of other musicians were here.  And that was the world that I was interested in, involved in.  So I couldn't wait to get here, but it, it took (laughter) the longest time--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to do that.
Story_ID: 588228
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Mary Dobbins Smikle] have any stories about growing up in West Point [Mississippi] that--that you can remember that--that are good stories?
Speaker 2: You, they're gonna kill me, but actually there are--there are few little day to day type stories about the teasing and things that they did to each other as kids.  And I can't remember most of them. I don't, I can't think of, at least, yeah, there's, there's nothing that resonated as that's a story that defines who you were as a kid in--in West Point.  A lot of the, the stories had to do because there was so big a family, there were so many brothers and sisters.  You know, a lot of it revolved around the fact of what happened to who.  There--there was a baby that passed post birth, Sally [ph.], I believe was the baby's name that, as brothers and sisters when we'd get together they would--there--that would be our--a reference point.  The other most talked about story was how her mother [Mamie Boatman] passed and there were rides.  She and one other woman, I forget who that was, it wasn't a family member, were riding in a coach going from West Point to I believe to Corinth [Mississippi].  And the weather was inclement and she ultimately caught a cold and ultimately got the flu and died from complications with the flu.  So that story got told quite a bit.  But most of the other things that they would pass on to us or talk about around the dinner table would be things about who teased who and remember how I used to always try to get you to, to read.  Other stories about the brothers who ventured out earliest leaving the family and people wanting to go with them. My Uncle John Ed Dobbins, we used to think for the longest time, I think collectively, that--that we had this real strong connection with church.  My grandfather [Henry Boatman] was a deacon in the church and John Ed, the son, second oldest son, became a pretty prominent minister.  Had a--had a prominent career as clergy in Cleveland [Ohio] and in East St. Louis [Illinois].  And was a dynamic speaker, a, a very dynamic minister.  And in--in the way that people like to spin yarn about, you know, the best of their family, he was touted as really like one of the shining stars of the family because of how successful he had become in the ministry.
Speaker 1: And his name again is?
Speaker 2: John Ed Dobbins.  And he married Ophelia Dobbins who I believe also was from West Point, Mississippi and they ultimately moved to East St. Louis and to Cleveland.   There are strains of people picking up on the, the trades and careers of other family members.  Whatever kind of store Poppa, as they used to call my grandfather, had passed on in the DNA of George [George Dobbins (ph.)] who operated a, a store in East St. Louis.  And I wanna say that that was his occupation, was operating that store.  I remember it was a little corner like candy store, general dry goods store, convenience store we'd call it now.  And there aren't any other things that relate to the family history that other people engaged in, at least not that I can think of.
Story_ID: 588229
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, di- did you get a sense that they, they had warm or fond memories of Mississippi, you know, when the family would talk about the state or did they--did they move because they just--it was better economic, what--was, was--did they wanna really get out of Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--life in Miss- in West Point [Mississippi] for my mother's [Mary Dobbins Smikle] family was a pretty, what's the word, enjoyable doesn't really capture it.  It was a memorable time for them.  I think mostly because everyone was there.  It was--it was the last time that they were all together as brothers and sisters, even after the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So the family memories are the ones that they?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The idea of having the entire family around was--
Speaker 1: But was, was there ever a desire to go back to West Point or to?
Speaker 2: No.  Once gone, stayed gone.  To the degree that I have never been to West Point.  My brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] made a trip with some, some other family members for what I think has gotta be maybe the one trip that a group of the family made to there.  There was nothing there that compelled them to come back, either gravesites, an- any old homes or any of that.  Eventually everyone left.  And I think a lot of it, once, once their parents [Mamie Boatman and Henry Boatman] died, there wasn't really anything holding them there.  Plus too, you know, this is a time when if you're ambitious, and all of them were, that was synonymous with leaving the South.  So first opportunity, everybody headed north on their own usually and did so in pursuit of a better life.  And as, as good as it was when they were all there, there was nothing to compel them, any of them to go back to live there or to stay there.
Story_ID: 588230
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother [Mary Dobbins Smikle], what kind of person is she and?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, my mom passed away two years ago in November of 2004, cancer.  And she was a great mother.  She really was.  And part of how I gauge that is because she learned how to be a mother without having grown up with a mother.  And my father [Kenneth Smikle] was in a similar situation.  And I think that may have been, in fact I'm sure of it, that that's one of the things that kind of brought them together.  It was--it was a pain, if you will, that they both shared, that he grew up with a stepfather that he didn't like, didn't know his real father.  And she grew up without her mom [Mamie Boatman] at least from the age of seven on.  And, and that was a really strong emotional bond, I think, between the two of them.  And as a result, they have very clear ideas, you know, looking back about having children, having a family, having an ideal as much as possible that they, themselves, did not have in that way, a relationship with their parents.
Story_ID: 588231
Speaker 1: So, my mom was resourceful is (laughter) probably an understatement.  I mean she didn't--she came north and worked believe in late teens, I mean like eighteen or nineteen, and was living with her older sister Louise [Louise Dobbins Green (ph.)].  Got work, became a seamstress which was like one of her main skills, things--one of the things she was proudest of.  Got a job in the Garment District of New York [New York].  And was--they--and met my father in New York.  And being a mother was a very defining thing for her and I think it was because nobody really mothered her, at least, you know, beyond the age of seven.
Speaker 2: Did she consider that a very special type of--she considered being a mother a special--not the others don't, but I understand what you're saying that she?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, yeah that it, it held a very special kind of significance for her.  This is what a mother should do kind of edict.  And I--and she had to learn it, she had to learn it pretty much on her own.  And coming to New York [New York] probably helped a lot 'cause there was a growing black middle class community, especially post war [World War II, WWII] and you know, they eventually moved out to Queens [New York] where everyone who was being--who was black and being ambitious wanted to get out of the urban life of Manhattan, Harlem [New York, New York] and in some cases from Brooklyn [New York] to go try and do the suburban life as Lorraine Hansberry so brilliantly captured it.  You know, the American dream of living in the burbs [suburb].  So there were like minded and other women of similar circumstances there and they all did the parenting thing together.  She was very involved in what we were doing.  Meaning that she drove us to school.  She'd play with us in the schoolyard.  We always go to school early (laughter), I don't know what that was about, if it was a scheduling thing or what.  You know, her day couldn't begin until she got us to school and then she wo- so she would take us and we'd get there early and very often there would be very few, no other kids there yet.  So she'd play catch with us in the schoolyard, my brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] and I.  And she was not afraid--interestingly enough again I guess I really haven't thought of this 'til now, but she had no fear of so called authority figures or of those in charge if you will or, or of whites as a result of any experience that she may have had at West Point in Mississippi.  You know, it was interesting about my parents [Mary Dobbins Smikle and Kenneth Smikle] about how they developed that--that attitude.  And she knew all of my teachers (laughter) on a first name basis and was very involved.  And we were very conscious of the fact that you weren't gonna be able get away with nothing, simply because the teacher didn't know your mom or my mother didn't know the teacher.  So, yeah, she was thoroughly involved in what we were doing as kids.  And tried to give us as much in the way of access, opportunities, character to have us be as we were always saying, there was this emphasis on being different, don't be like the crowd.  You know, there was some kids who at the bus stop when she--when we transferred to another school, she would take us--drive us to the bus stop where the bus would pick us up.  We were part of that first group of kids that integrated New York City school system.  And she would drive us to the bus stop and we would sit in the car and the kids--other kids who were waiting, a pretty rowdy bunch and we--she would give us a running commentary on what everybody was doing and how I better not ever catch you doing that (laughter).  And so, she was really involved.
Story_ID: 588232
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah well that's interesting concept of the difference.  But I'm gonna pause and let's go to your father's side.  And can--can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His full name is Dr. Kenneth Raymond Smikle, S-M-I-K-L-E [Kenneth Smikle].
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His place of birth is Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  It's March 3rd and I believe that is 1921.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Wilkes-Barre, that's a place you pass on the turnpike.  A lot of people go through there and they'll stop there to get gas and (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And this is another one--
Speaker 1: Up in the hills of Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you know, the more I got to know about Wilkes-Barre the more curious I became about how did you all ever end up in Wilkes-Barre.  His mother was from Mile Gully in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Mile Gully.
Speaker 1: M-I-L-E?
Speaker 2: M-I-L-E.
Speaker 1: Mile Gully.
Speaker 2: In--yeah.  And which is in the Mandeville Parish, Jamaica [sic. Manchester Parish, Jamaica].  Yet another place I haven't been too.  And she came to the states as a young girl through family connections.  Again, mostly to pursue work.
Speaker 1: Now this has to be around the turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: She comes here.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did she come right to--did she come to New York [New York] first or?
Speaker 2: I believe, if we have the track right, it's that she--she came through Canada and then ca- and then went to New York.  And then from New York, not sure how they ended up in Wilkes-Barre.  My aunt, who is my father's sister, is the one that has the stories on this and I don't think she's even absolutely certain about what it was.  But as far as we can tell it was work related.
Speaker 1: Did--did she have other family members here when she came?
Speaker 2: She had a sister, but I didn't know her, at least, yeah, not--I mean her sister is a person that I knew was there as a kid, but I don't have any recollection of her.  And she passed away, my grandmother, my father's mother, passed away in 1965 (pause), I think it was.
Speaker 1: Now what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Pearl Smikle Simington.
Speaker 1: Simington, S-Y-M-I-N-G?
Speaker 2: S-I-M-I-N-G-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and a--well how far back can you trace that side of the family.  I mean, can--do, do you have stories from Jamaica?
Speaker 2: We--my, my cousin has done some tracing on that and my father had some sketchy references to family members there.  We don't know where in West Africa our family came from, but they were from West Africa.  She had uncles who were named--she--for the days of the week that they were born on.
Speaker 1: Oh like, Kwame and Kujoe and that sort of thing, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right, Kwasiba and there was an Uncle Juba.  So they had names that identified them for their place of birth.  So well we don't have any specific information about where in West Africa the family on her side was originally from.
Speaker 1: They had a tradition of having come to the states from West Africa, I mean to, to Jamaica from--
Speaker 2: To Jamaica, right.
Speaker 1: --after, I guess, would have to be in between 1850 and the turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Right.  And we all, and in his case, we don't know who his father was.  Hence, him having, it wasn't Simington.  Simington was a stepfather.
Speaker 1: So your father doesn't know--there's no--there's no clear--
Speaker 2: Doesn't, doesn't know his father, right, right.  And you know, but in Jamaica, in Jamaica, Smikle is a pretty common name.  And I remember when we lived in New York, we used to love to open the phone book, the Queens [New York] white pages and be the only one.  And then, little by little, other Smikles, Gladstone would pop up and so forth.  And, yeah, I don't know what it is about the culture, but it was always hard to connect with those folks to see if there was a connection.  But yeah, he, he had his mother's maiden name.  She gave him her maiden name at birth, and--or so we believe because we don't think that his father's name was Smikle.  So, all of that made for a very murky trail to, to kind of back into.
Story_ID: 588233
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of work did she do in Wilkes-Barre [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: It was domestic work.  And to the best of my knowledge that was the only sort of work that she did do.  And they left Wilkes-Barre and came back to New York [New York].  And he [Smikle's father, Kenneth Smikle] and for the rest of his--most of his adult life lived in New York the entire time.
Speaker 1: Did--did he grow up in Wilkes-Barre or in New York?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know exactly how long they were there.  It was just a matter of a few years, like three, four.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he basically grew up in New York I guess, there right, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He--most of his adult life, childhood even because, you know, by the time--I--I think he was somewhere around the age of six when they left Wilkes-Barre.
Speaker 1: In 1927 I'm guessing?
Speaker 2: And they, I'm trying to think if Harlem [New York, New York] was--yeah if Harlem was the first place that they came back to.  And he was the man of the family.  You know, he had two other sisters and (pause) each of them, he had, obviously, a different father then his sisters did.  So he was really the man of the house and--and took the responsibility really seriously, which that plus my grandmother's [Pearl Smikle Simington] drive, which is exhibited just by the amount of moving around she did just to find better work.  She clearly was not afraid to go where she thought she could do better and that sort of became a, a pathos--we operate as a family.  He early on was--had a reputation for being a tinkerer as a kid.  My aunt tells this story all the time about them getting presents and gifts and him taking 'em apart (laughter) and putting them back together again successfully, but was always deconstructing stuff.  And so he, he became very much self-taught, self-made kind of person.  And that was a defining characteristic for him and, and one that was really apparent to us, my brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] and I, and, and really apparent in how he raised us.  'Cause he tried to expose us to as many different things as he possibly could.  He was really big on reading.  He was very big on being different.  Not giving into any limitations in life.
Story_ID: 588234
Speaker 1: The range of things that he [Smikle's father, Kenneth Smikle] attempted in his lifetime is like nothing short of incredible.  And the thing that was most fascinating about all of that was his occupation.  He was an electronics engineer.  He started with--why--he'd--he gotten involved in early radio technology as a kid building crystal sets and things like that.  Went into the [U.S.] Army and was in the Signal Corps [U.S. Army Signal Corps].
Speaker 2: In World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 1: In World War II.  And went to Italy, served, served--yeah I don't know the regiment he served and I always tried to find that out.  We, we had some papers, but they've been misplaced on that, but we know he was in the Signal Corps.  He still has his, his uniform patches, things from serving in the Signal Corps.  And he came out involved in electronics, early microwave technology and really had, without having a college degree, an education that rivaled anyone with one in his field.  And--
Speaker 2: So he went to high school in New York [New York] right, did he finish high (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, went to high school in New York and went to work--
Speaker 2: Did, did he finish in Harlem [New York, New York] or in another borough?
Speaker 1: Yeah, did.  Finished, yeah, all of his adolescent and school, early schooling in uptown New York.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What--I read a remarkable thing, he went back to school and earned his Ph.D., right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: How old was he when he--when he did that?
Speaker 1: Ooh, he--I mean he went back when--in the--well it's an interesting story about that.  When he did it and why he did it is, is worth telling.  He became a manager in virtually every job that he worked in.  So originally--his first job was working at a company called Bud Stanley [ph.] which was a manufacturing company that manufactured electronic components in Long Island City, New York [Long Island City, Queens, New York].  He worked in retail too, I'm not sure if it was a second job, but he worked at Divegas [ph.] which became O'Dell's [ph.] in New York.  (Laughter) I can see him being a salesman 'cause he loved people, he really did.  And he went from--because the electronics industry, particularly the branch that he was working at was so tied to government contracts, the fates and fortunes of companies went up and down fairly regularly, so he would be at one place, they go out of business, he'd go to work at the competitor.  They would go on and you know, secure X number of contracts.  They were doing work, well for example, I think one of the things he was proudest of is that the company he worked at, which as a business started to move out to Long Island [New York] from Long Island City; it went further out onto the island.  And he worked for a company called Lyco which was next door to Grumman [Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation; Northrop Grumman], Grumman had built this huge facility out in Syosset, Long Island.  So they worked on wave guide--microwave or what they call wave guide components that were used in the early Mercury space program [Project Mercury] in the capsule.  And so he had a government clearance as a result of that work.  So, you know, all of it was pretty amazing for a black man in the '60s [1960s] in New York.
Story_ID: 588235
Speaker 1: And you know, he had--we lived in a neighborhood, we lived in St. Albans [Queens, New York] and our neighbors were all equally ambitious guys, but for the most part blue collar city workers.  And, you know, he was the--the only guy of his type in the neighborhood.  I used to ask him, I'm like, you know, who do you talk with that knows what you know.  And, you know, I, I remember the other--the other fathers in the neighborhood really kind of being in awe of him because, yeah he loved to talk and he knew a lot.  So that was a dangerous combination (laughter), you virtually had to stop him in conversations to, to--, "Okay Ken [Smikle's father, Kenneth Smikle], we got it," (laughter).  But he, he had this real thirst for knowledge and there was literally nothing that escaped his curiosity.  He studied sailing and I remember the nautical maps that he brought home because he took a sailing class as part of a adult education class.  Went back to school, first effort at going back to school to get his degree.  He went to Queens College [Queens, New York] at night to do that.  And didn't--wasn't able for whatever reason to complete the program to get his degree then.  But in the course of things, you know, took anything that interested him.  And I remember that sailing and nautical navigation was one of those things.  They bought land in Upstate New York, forty acres, that was connected somehow in ownership to some folks on my mother's [Mary Dobbins Smikle] side of the family.  I think only through an acquaintance somebody knew someone who had this property, and they bought it, forty acres of land in upstate--in the Catskills [Catskill Mountains].  He had this dream of, you know, turning into a real country farm.  And I, I remember him doing organic gardening right back in 1964.
Speaker 2: He was ahead of--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so he was--he was really ahead of the curve, ahead of his time.  We--I mean, I've come to think of him as a Renaissance man 'cause of the breadth of things that he pursued and vigorously too.
Story_ID: 588236
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents [Mary Dobbins Smikle and Kenneth Smikle] met?
Speaker 2: Ah yeah (laughter) there is something of a story about that.  The connection became the church.  His mother was going to, to St. John's Baptist Church which is about 134th [sic. 152nd Street] right off of Amsterdam [Avenue] in Harlem [New York, New York].  And my aunt was a member there and my mother went, when she came to New York [New York], went there with her.  And so he didn't go, at least not regularly.  And matter of fact, this might've become his primary motivation at some point.  My mother was singing in the choir and my grandmother [Pearl Smikle Simington], not quite sure why she was trying to find him, the man of the house, a wife (laughter) so urgently other than the fact that she knew well okay maybe I just want some grandkids or whatever.  But she was the one that pointed out my mother being this nice young lady in the choir.  And so, he, you know, they--he came to church and they met and you know, they started going for long walks and I mean we've heard great stories about how they literally used to walk from downtown and I, you know, the--oh forgetting the name of the building [Flatiron Building, New York, New York] that's at 23rd [Street] and 5th [Avenue], that defines the area.  And they used to walk from there all the way to Harlem.  And, you know, we as kids we thought that was pretty romantic until they told us motivation was to save the money (laughter) they would've spent for the bus or the trains.  And they said, ah let's just walk, you know, so it was nothing for them to walk 100 some blocks, from one end of the city to the other.  And, and he met with the approval of the rest of the family because again, like I said, they moved in clusters.  So two of my mother's sister, a half-sister and her--the sister right before her, Louise [Louise Dobbins Green (ph.)], were all living there and she was with them.  And so, you know, he had a lot of filters to go through, everybody got to pass judgment on this guy whether or not he was worthy of marrying one of the Dobbins sisters.  And they used to tell us great stories about, you know, all of that (laughter).  And so--and he measured up.  And everybody thought yeah he was nice young man, ambitious and you know, we know his mother, she's a churchgoer.  We don't know about him, is he--how often is he going to church, you know, okay, all right, well we'll work on that (laughter).  And they again in, you know, in retrospect in this age where we start to deconstruct our paths with another kind of consciousness.  They were two people who were, I think, looking to have a family better than the family they grew up in, at least--as far as the parenting situation went.  So, yeah, there was no, no doubt that, you know, they both had that in common that they wanted to raise a family and raise kids.
Story_ID: 588237
Speaker 1: How many brother and sisters do you have, just--is it just you and your brother?
Speaker 2: I have--it's just--it's just my brother, [HistoryMaker] Dawoud Bey, whose real name is David Smikle, at least that's what the birth certificate says (laughter).  And I have foster sisters that grew up with us.  I re- you know, I hate the term, I've got a whole other thing on that, but that's another meeting.
Speaker 1: Quite a few foster sisters or how many?
Speaker 2: I have two that I stay in touch regularly and a third one that I hear from, from time to time.  And my two sisters still live in New York [New York] and have kids of their own.  My niece and nephews, it's one girl between them.  I don't know how, boys just seem to dominate in our family, much to my wife's [HistoryMaker Renee Ferguson] chagrin (laughter), 'cause I think she thought there was some possibility we might have a daughter.  I'm like, not unless we keep running the coach's play, we're gonna--this is it.  So, they still live in New York and we--yeah we all grew up in New York.  And my--my father's sister, Dorothy Matthews, still lives in New York and she has grandchildren and not, not yet great-grandchildren.  But I have two cousins they--her two daughters that are both still in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they're holding down the New York contingent while we expand the Chicago [Illinois] presence of the family.
Story_ID: 588238
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I get teased about this a lot 'cause, you know, my--in my mind my earliest childhood memory is leaving the hospital where I was born (laughter).  And nobody buys this because, well, let me put it this way, my brother doesn't buy it, my aunt kind of buys it, my--my dad [Kenneth Smikle] kind of bought into it because he realized that I had too many details about things that were accurate and it's just a little simple memory about the hospital and leaving it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, you know, it's like yeah sure Ken [HistoryMaker Ken Smikle], you know, he's really lost it now.
Speaker 1: I shouldn't laugh on camera (laughter) (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, if we don't laugh on camera, there's no interview here because this life has been too good, too funny.  And this is one of those moments without a doubt.
Speaker 1: So you actually remem- you have a memory of remembering that you were--of leaving the hospital in the day that you were born?
Speaker 2: And the--and--it's, it's, it's like a snapshot that used to reocc- reoccur in my memory as a kid growing up.  I mean, I re- remember it a lot, about thinking about it a lot when I was a kid.  And it just kind of--because I kept thinking about it, I mean, you know, like nowadays you don't know if you really remember something or you remember the video you saw of it.  And that's what locked in your brain.  Well that wasn't the case here clearly.  You know, so I said I remember like this area of glass boxes, which turns out that's--it's the cashier area where you would leave the hospital and pay your bill.  And there were these partitions where they had these frosted glass boxes that you walked through.  And I sa- and I remember my uncle and the car.  And that's, you know, what I remember of it.  Now my uncle was my Aunt Louise's [Louise Dobbins Green (ph.)] husband, Norman, Norman Green [ph.], who did come to pick up my mother [Mary Dobbins Smikle] when she left the hospital because my father couldn't.  And co- and I think because he had a car and I don't know that my folks did at the time.  So he drove us home from the hospital.  So he said oh you heard us talking about that, and what not.  And I said, no--I said I, I remember him, it's like--it's like this locked memory of a man in a long coat.  And Columbia Presbyterian Hospital [New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York] had this long driveway, almost courtyard like that you come up into.  So I remember us walking out and him standing with backlit with this long coat on.  I mean, that, that was the image.  So they swear that they--you picked that up 'cause you heard somebody talking about it and you just came up with the image in your head and that's what you remember.  So I okay, fine, whatever (laughter).  But in my mind, it's not a bad first memory to have, even if you made it up (laughter).  But most of my earlier memories were about growing up in--in Queens, in Jamaica, Queens [New York].
Story_ID: 588239
Speaker 1: Queens [New York] is different from the other boroughs because you actually have a little yard--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and a little house rather than, is, is that pretty much?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean that's exactly what it was.  They moved out there within a year af- a year, a year or two after I was born.  So I don't have any recollections of living in the city 'cause, but that's where they were originally.
Speaker 1: Where did they live before in the city?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm gonna forget the street.
Speaker 1: Well I didn't mean the street, but were they in Harlem [New York, New York] or Brooklyn [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was in Harlem.
Speaker 1: Harlem, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we lived on 115th Road and Sullivan [sic.].  My brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] did it and now I'm gonna do it, I'm starting to doubt that street as well.  It was near Linden Boulevard.
Story_ID: 588240
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well we always ask a question like this and it's supposed to work, you know.  What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The number one sight and sound of growing up was this bakery on the corner from where we lived, a German bakery.  And I can see the tiles on the floor, the white tile floor there and the windows with all of the cookies and pastries laid out.  And my dad would take us up there every now and then and buy us a cookie, which I didn't put this on my form became my nickname, as a kid you know.
Speaker 1: Nickname Cookie, let me go back to that (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah growing up that was my nickname.  Cookie was what most people called me.
Speaker 1: Really, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, for the longest time.  Hey it's funny, because I--for the longest time I just didn't relate to it at all (laughter).  But since my dad was Ken [Kenneth Smikle] and I was Ken [HistoryMaker Ken Smikle], I was doomed to have a nickname, right.  And it wasn't Junior because we had different middle names.  So, yeah Cookie was my nickname.
Speaker 1: Did your brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] have one too?
Speaker 2: Well that's the other interesting thing.  I come from a family where, at least on my mother's side, everybody had two names.  Everybody had--
Speaker 1: That's--I have to say that that's very Mississippi.  (Laughter) It is, very Mississippi.  And I mean people there, there's hardly anybody left in Mississippi doesn't have two or three names and nobody in their family.  There's their given name, there's a nickname, there's another name usually too.
Speaker 2: I used to think of it as southern, but I never thought of it as specifically a Mississippi thing.
Speaker 1: It may be southern in general too, but I, I know in Mississippi very much.
Speaker 2: Well the funny story about that is, when you asked me earlier what my mom's name was, my--there was only one sister, the girls all had nicknames, so Mamie [Mamie Dobbins] was Sister the oldest, Louise [Louise Dobbins Green (ph.)] was Nan, Flora [Flora Dobbins (ph.)] was just Flora, she's the only one that did escape (laughter), Mary [Mary Dobbins Smikle] was May, but on one of those--on that trip back to West Point [Mississippi] that they took, when they went to the county records, they have my mother's name as Virginia and so (laughter) this whole family (laughter) legend revolved around, how did you get the name Mary.  I was, you know, she was adamant, oh I don't--with my mother, when she believed something, it was done.  The records were wrong (laughter), there was no doubt about that.  And so, you know, the legend of the two name syndrome continued.  My mother ended up being the only one with three.
Story_ID: 588241
Speaker 1: So, you know, the legend of the nicknames sort of continued because Renee, my wife, her father's from Mississippi as well.  And he had two names, you know, everybody used to call him Kirk and (laughter) his real name is Eugene [Eugene Ferguson].  And so (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Unrelated even, you know, that (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right and so it's like these two families getting together (unclear) somebody else (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) your name is Eugene, seem like your name--your nickname would be Gene, you know, but it's not, it's Kirk.
Speaker 1: Right.  No, no.  And so oddly enough, Renee, you know, I have my nickname, my own nickname.  And--and I thought she didn't have one.  You know, okay, she kind of escaped that.  But it turns out, you know, her real first name is Marcia and she didn't like it, so she used her middle name.  And that--that's how [HistoryMaker] Renee Ferguson was born.  And so there was a real--real tug of war about when Jason [Jason Smikle] was born whether he was gonna have a nickname, what would it be and all of that.  So sure enough, I mean, I think it just happens.  And in his case, I said okay with a name like Jason, and so his grandmother [Mary Ferguson], who lived with us, and you know, raised him with us, used to call him Jaso.  She just dropped the n off the end, so that became like his name around the house.  And I noticed when he went to school, kids just called him Jay.  "Hey Jay."  So you know, what's in a name, apparently a lot of history and maybe a little DNA too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I think there's a reason for those double names, and being unrelated to each other too.  You know, I mean, like Eugene is not related to Kirk in any kind of way, you know, just.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it came from his, might have been his middle name, yeah.
Speaker 2: Is it? Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --but not Gene.
Story_ID: 588242
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up, we were?
Speaker 2: Well let's see.  Other than that bakery, I guess the main sights and sounds come from, (pause) it's funny, I mean what comes to mind when you first asked the question other than that bakery, was just being in the car.  When we had a car, which was again just another one of those examples of being ambitious.  Yeah, I mean, you--you need--they needed a car for him to go to work, but my mother [Mary Dobbins Smikle] had the car, you know, to drive around and do what she had to do and with us. So I was always fascinated with the car, because we spent so much time in it. That became one of the big sounds and smells because, you know, those--those old Fords and--it's funny because he--my father [Kenneth Smikle] would buy these use--the succession of used cars.  The first one was a K--was a Kaiser [Kaiser-Frazer Corporation] and because he was into the nuance of things, I probably knew more about Kaisers than any other black kid in the neighborhood.  In fact, I know it for sure.  And we--you know, we would go through this thing of identifying another Kaiser when you saw it on the road, which kind of reinforced that thing of we're different 'cause everybody doesn't have a Kaiser (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right, it is a different--
Speaker 2: So he had an old Oldsmobile, I mean an old one from '20s [1920s], which, you know, had some running board on it and all of that.  Then had a Hudson, Hudson Fastback, brown, I remember that thing, it looked kind of like modern--
Speaker 1: A Hudson, now you're bringing back some names of cars, Kaisers, Hudsons.  Yeah, he did like unusual cars?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did--well again, he was an engineer.  So a lot of that was, these are better made cars or these cars are made differently or they have features about how they're built that were just appealing to that side of--of himself.  So--
Speaker 1: So did he tinker around with them a lot?
Speaker 2: He did all his own car repair work.  I can see it now in my head, sights and sounds, you know, long plank of wood, car backed up on the plank so that you could raise the front or the rear of it up, and his feet coming out under the car working on the engine, changing the breaks, he did all that himself.  He loved doing it.  I don't even think it was so much about saving money, it was about, if anything, I can do it as good as anybody I can take it to.  If I can't I wanna get there.  You know, he was a person who loved working with his hands.  And he, you know, he was busy a lot.  It's funny because the memories of being with him are probably more precious because-- because he was a busy person and he was also not just taking care of us but he was still taking care of his mother [Pearl Smikle Simington], who had an apartment in New York [New York], but he soon enough after th- that--soon after that bought a house and moved her out to Queens [New York] as well and had a tenant upstairs, so he was a landlord as well.  And I mean, he--my father really had a great appreciation for the value of owning real estate.  Now albeit in this case, it was serving a double purpose, you know.  But he was ambitious in that way.  And the other sights and sounds were from about living in Queens in St. Albans.
Story_ID: 588243
Speaker 1: Was the neighborhood, who was the neigh- neighborhood composed of then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It--we were alway- again, I don't know if its ambition or just a pioneering spirit, but we were always one of the first black families on whatever block we moved in, moved on to.  So, 115th Road, which was on one side of Baisley Park [Baisley Pond Park, Queens, New York].  Baisley Park became sort of a dividing line in what is now generally sweepingly called South Jamaica.  Baisley Park was an area that was among the last to get integrated.  It was the part of Queens [New York] that was closest to the beginning of Long Island [New York].  And so in speaking about where blacks migrated to, if you went to Brooklyn [New York] and then the migration swept into Queens and further out into Far Rockaway [Queens, New York].  So they lived in the part, moved to the part that was least integrated.  It was at the vanguard of the sweeping change that was taking place of where blacks lived in Queens.  So they were never uncomfortable living in a white neighborhood, being around whites and raised us that way.  And I think as sights and sounds go, that's one of the things that I grew up with, that we lived where white families were, where white kids were, and it was normal.  You know, I, I was really very, very sheltered from racism throughout my entire life.  And because they were trying to do it differently and because they didn't have experiences with overt racism themselves or through their parents, the approach to race in our house was different.  I know, you know, yeah you hear the occasional, you know, when--when other adults would come around, dinners, what have you, you--you hear the occasional talk about Mr. Charlie this and Mr. Charlie that.  And it just wasn't an ongoing conversation in our home because we always had something to balance the prejudice that was there with the reality of people we knew who weren't like that, our neighbors.  Our next door neighbors, a German couple lived next door, the Kannects [ph.], who were--you know, we were in their house, they were in our house, have clear memories about my dad [Kenneth Smikle] and him having long conversations on his stoop.  It was that kind of relationship with--with white families, with white people.  And so yo- you I--I remember sort of growing up with a kind of idealism that later on I found a lot of folks didn't have.  And that idealism translated into a really strong optimistic spirit.  You know, there was no such thing as can't do it.  You know, everything literally was possible.
Story_ID: 588244
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, most definitely.  I mean, we (laughter), we were raised in a church.  We were driven to Sunday school and my parents [Mary Dobbins Smikle and Kenneth Smikle] would drop us off at Calvary Baptist Church [Jamaica, New York].  First we started out by going to Sunday school at a Lutheran church that was in walking distance.  So we started by walking there.  And then, because my mother was going to Calvary Baptist Church, and she more than my dad, I think he--he used us going to church as a time for him to have some time to himself, you know, to do whatever.  You know, to avoid the honey do list.  And so he--he went occasionally.  But it was in stone in the house, you know, we were going to church on Sunday.  And we went to Calvary Baptist Church which was a really interesting church and had a big role in my upbringing in terms of how I saw other African Americans in the community, how I saw church in the community, the role of church in the community.  We were in a burgeoning black middle class neighborhood and this was the church that was trying to respond to that.  Walter Penn [Walter S. Penn], dynamic clergyman, very involved in social justice, civil rights, an accountant by training saw the need to build a congregation that would be involved in civil rights, in social justice, but in a different black middle class sort of way where we could use the influence that we have as prominent folks in the community to change this community.  He was active in the first black bank that was built there, Allied Federal [Allied Federal Savings and Loan], a founder of it, which meant that the church, itself, was very active there.  And oddly enough, I--I think took some pride in that because the first business account that I ever opened was at Allied Federal and that was in college when we started a business.  So all of those things, small as they were, were very much a part of the nuance of how I saw things.  And the church had a great choir, a good gospel choir, but a great chancel choir.
Speaker 1: Did you sing in the choir?
Speaker 2: I didn't, oddly enough, I never did.  And I love singing, sang in high school, sang--sang in junior high school [J.H.S. 217, Robert A. Van Wyck Junior High School, Queens, New York].  Didn't sing and play--went to orchestra and band, but yeah di- di- sang in the chorus in elementary school [P.S. 123, Queens, New York] and loved that, 'cause I just love the sound of voices and harmony.  And, you know, we had this musical side to us.  So, we had some musical talent (laughter) that we may or may not talk about.  But a real love of music.  And so that--that choir is one of--and when you talk about the sights and sounds of childhood, that choir singing and listening to them on Sundays is a big part of the memories of growing up.
Story_ID: 588245
Speaker 1: Well, what about television and radio?
Speaker 2: It's interesting.  My father [Kenneth Smikle] was a TV--I mean, he--he wa- his first entrepreneurial career was as a TV and radio repairman in the neighborhood [St. Albans, Queens, New York].  Folks were always bringing his stuff and that's how we made money on the side.  And we weren't allowed later to watch television, but trying to think how old we had to have been when I was--had to be like five, six, seven years old before anybody knew better, I had--I had to be the only kid in my neighborhood with a television in our room.  So we--we really had a television.
Speaker 1: So you and your brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] had a TV?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a TV in our room.  That was incredible when you think about it, but less so because of our circumstances.  You know, my old man had televisions.  You know, he was fixing them and you know, and he--he--we'd pass a discarded TV on the curb waiting to be picked up by sanitation and he'd pull over, jump out of the car, turn that sucker over and start pulling the tubes out of it to use as spare parts in the repair work.  And then so eventually, you know, his little collection of things grew and so yeah, we had a television.  I remember watching the Gillette fights ['The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports'] on TV in the room, little round screen, round tube, black and white set.  And that lasted awhile and then I guess school got to be a serious thing.  It's like, okay the TV's gone, that's outta the room.  But we always ha- I always had a radio in my room.  And yeah, I guess that's how the whole media thing got started.  'Cause I was really into the thing that delivered the picture, the sound and I would get into then as adult what the picture and sound were.
Speaker 1: Did--did you ever have a favorite shows, favorite personalities on TV or radio?
Speaker 2: I liked Westerns, 'Lone Ranger' ['The Lone Ranger'].  And it's funny I remember not liking 'Howdy Doody' ['The Howdy Doody Show'], all that much, a little too abstract (laughter).  And the fights I remember those watching the fights, and the comedies 'cause, you know, people talk about Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca or whatever, it's like, you know, that--that wasn't something I read in a history book, I used to watch that.  I watched those routines on television.  Red Buttons and all the comics from back then, yeah.  Those a--those are memories too.
Speaker 1: What about radio, any radio personalities that stand out?
Speaker 2: My father was big on radio.  He was a ham radio operator.  So he, in a matter of speaking, you know, he was in radio himself.  That's a big sight and sound from childhood of him doing Morse code out to folks.  You know, had a little radio shack set up in the basement, and he--we always had one, every house.  He always had ham radio shack.  An area of the house where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Talk to people from other countries and?
Speaker 2: Right, right, different kind of guy, you know.  And, you know, it's interesting because I mean he can--he literally could transcend a black reality through all of these things.  He really defined his own life.  And no doubt he was a black man.  I remember a early copy of 'Invisible Man' [Ralph Ellison] in my father's basement and me looking at it and said what is this about.  You know, as a kid trying to figure out what is this story about.
Story_ID: 588246
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did he--did, did, did he talk about race consciousness at all?
Speaker 2: We didn't.  Race was something that I think we were allowed to define for ourselves.  Because in the absence of any overt racism, again they protected us from that.  They were very aware of the environment that we were in. They sort of threw us into the deep water of integration and let us fend for ourselves.  We were--my brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] and I were part of the group that in--first integrated the school system and--in New York [New York], the first kids on the bus, among that group.  But even before that, they were moving us around.  We were supposed to go and--we were supposed to go to P.S. 140 [Edward K. Ellington School] on one side of Baisley Park [Baisley Pond Park, Queens, New York] and the dividing line.  And Sutphin Boulevard, I just remembered the street, Sutphin Boulevard was like a diving- dividing line.  So we were supposed to go to one and I don't know how they did it, but through or the other, we used--they literally used the address, they worked this out.  There was, my brother talked about her in his interview, Hortense Jones, one of the most dynamic folks in education in New York City.  A real fighter, a real warrior for quality education for black kids.  And they had worked out something with her where this was the world's worst kept secret because the principal was in on it, she was in on it, my parents [Mary Dobbins Smikle and Kenneth Smikle] were in on it, and these folks who lived on the right side of the dividing line were in on it.  We used their address so that we could go to the school where Mrs. Jones taught and had had some juice.  And it was a better school, no doubt about that.  The other one was in--yeah and there were a few white kids who were going to 123.  So it was still integrated even by the time we were going to it.  A lot of whites had fled the neighborhood but there was still enough there so that things hadn't fallen on hard times there.  And so they manipulated that in a way, I forget what you asked me originally about how we got into this.  But that was one of the things they did to get us to this better school, it was like everybody was in on it.  So what--I forget what the question was.
Speaker 1: I--I'm--we segued, I do not know from the original.  But, yeah, but that do--so you went to grade school where first, where was your first grade school?
Speaker 2: Our first grade school was P.S. 123 in Jamaica, Queens [New York].  And--
Speaker 1: That's where Hortense Jones taught?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where she was.  And she's definitely a prominent figure.  A lot of--a lot of kids owe a whole lot to her.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, that's--that's interesting, okay.  Was she a black teacher, sounds like it?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.  In a school that had very, very, very, very few black teachers, I think we could count them on half of one hand.  But the dynamics of the neighborhood meant that the school was predominantly black.  So she was wielding power.  She was doing what she could to make that school provide quality education for those kids that were there.
Story_ID: 588247
Speaker 1: Now were you a good student in school, did you like school?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I have my father's [Kenneth Smikle] mind, his curiosity about things, which meant you heard the same phrase over and over again, "He's got so much potential" (laughter).  You know, what's wrong with him, why can't he this, that, you know.  I mean there were things that would grab my interest and I'd be locked on that.  Yeah, I--I like school because it was another level of social interaction.  The odd thing was, I was going to school with kids that I'd didn't live with in the neighborhood [St. Albans, Queens, New York], because we were on the other side of the park [Baisley Pond Park, Queens, New York] now.  So the only time I saw those kids were--was when we were at school.  And some of them were really great friends but, you know, we didn't play touch football.  I did that with a bunch of other kids on the block, all of whom--all of whom, at least at that point, went to a school that we didn't go to.  So again, we were different.  You know, when all those kids were going to P.S. 140 [Edward K. Ellington School, Queens, New York] and we escaped 140.  And I never did understand exactly what was wrong with 140 other than clearly my folks had the--the skinny on how good it was or was not or was soon to be headed in decline for whatever reason and 123 [P.S. 123, Queens, New York] was a better school.  As a result of going to 123, we were part of that group of kids.  I remember being tested for how smart we were, whether we could be part of that group that they were gonna integrate to the other side of town by bus.  So I remember, you know, we would go in a room and they would ask us these questions, one on one.  And we ended up being in that group that went to--not to the--to Shime- Shimer Junior High School [P.S. 142, Shimer Junior High School, Queens, New York], but to Van Wyck Junior High School [J.H.S. 217, Robert A. Van Wyck Junior High School], which was in a white neighborhood on--in the other side, I guess if we were south that technically was north Jamaica [Queens, New York], it was north of Jamaica Avenue.  And--and it's interesting because at that point you're, you know, you're getting kids, you're getting some of the, we were told, smartest black kids from that part of Jamaica now all going to this one junior high school, being bused to this junior high school.  So we were meeting kids from all over the city, all over that, that part of town I should say.  And they're all ambitious parents, really incredible potential and were responsible.  As I look back on who I went to school with, some of the kids, because we were all this busing pattern continued on through high school [Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Queens, New York].  'Cause once you got in--on the track it just continued right on through high school.
Story_ID: 588248
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you asked me if I liked school (laughter) that was the original question.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, right, yeah I know.
Speaker 2: And the answer is yes, in a word.  I--yeah I did like it.  I don't remember having a favorite subject.  I was good at art.  I remember always being, what's the word, getting special attention because I had art skills.  I drew very well.  (Laughter) I have these two memories about art.  One was in the third grade, yeah in the third grade [at P.S. 123, Queens, New York], we were asked to make our own wrapping paper.  So immediately kids started drawing these pictures of Santa Claus and trees on this like eleven by seventeen sheet of paper.  And I started making wrapping paper, which was a Christmas tree here, skip a space, do a Christmas tree again, go down another and, you know, just like rows, just like a printer pattern of (laughter) wrapping paper.  And the teacher made this enormous big deal about what I had done.  Said, "Look class, see what he--." Now this is wrapping paper.  "See what he's done," you know, "doesn't this look like wrapping paper," and then she hung it on the wall and it's like oh man.  You know, it's like Smikle [HistoryMaker Ken Smikle], the different one, making trouble for everybody again (laughter).  And there was one other kid in the class who I re- his name was Matthew [ph.], I forget his last name, he had really exceptional art talent too, or so they said.  I can--but I really thought so, even more so than me.  And so art--art was good.  But I had good teachers.  So I really had no favorite subject.  I--I mean, I liked English.  I loved social studies.  I was good in math, science.  It was all fascinating to me.  I was interested in all of it really.
Speaker 1: Did you have any particular teacher stand out as a mentor or a special teacher?
Speaker 2: In--in junior high school [J.H.S. 217, Robert A. Van Wyck Junior High School, Queens, New York], yeah, yeah, there were folks who were definitely mentors.  Some of whom knew my--my mother [Mary Dobbins Smikle] through her involvement in our education.  And so, therefore, they had a frame of reference about what our families were trying to do with us.  What their expectations were of us and they bought into that and were trying to help.  But there were just teachers that I liked.  And--and most--most of them were in high school [Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Queens, New York], I mean one or two in high school.  But Jerry Olcheck [ph.] who was the first guy that taught history the way college professors teach history.  It's like, let--let's bring a contemporary angle to this story.  You know, Queen Isabella [Isabella I of Castile] had this guy who was coming over the wall at night, you know, la di da.  That's how he would teach history.  So (laughter) it was a lot more interesting listening to Jerry Olcheck teach, teach history.  And (laughter) we had a gym teacher who was a drill sergeant who had gone to Nam [Vietnam] (laughter) and that was a nightmare.  And I liked my music teachers a lot, they were, were sort of mentors, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you play in it, in (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I played in band, yeah, from junior high school on.  And that was like a great experience.  'Cause, you know, you get to be on stage and they act--and these were schools that had resources, right, so we got on stage, they would record the concert, there was lighting and the AV [audiovisual] staff put a lot into lighting us and all of that so.  You really felt like you were performing.  And all of that stuff played into how I saw the world and what I wanted to do career wise.  I played trombone.  And, and, you know, we had taken piano lessons like since forever.  As a matter of fact, my parents found us one of the really well known, black, concert pianist Slocum [ph.], I'm trying to remember her first name now.  But only later on did I learn, I mean I was learning from the best people there--that there were at the time, some of whom were African American.  And a lot--most of whom were African American.  So that--that was a gift and we weren't even aware of it.
Story_ID: 588249
Speaker 1: Were your parents [Mary Dobbins Smikle and Kenneth Smikle]--did, did you all talk about the Civil Rights Movement a lot growing up or did you?
Speaker 2: I don't remember it.  You know, I don't think that we did.  I mean, we sort of picked up on the conversations that they had with other adults and so forth.  You know, and, and I'm sure we talked about it because there's no way they would've sent us into (laughter) integrated situations where we were doing the integrating and not give us some kind of background, some kind of perspective.  But usually, (pause) I'm trying to remember the phrases that they used to use.  But usually it would just be--the fact--I'll tell ya, the only instance I remember of overt racism was one time my father was trying to get to the bank before it closed.  And he actually got inside and he had to do something, he was trying--I don't know if he was--I think he was just trying to make a deposit but he had to do something else and he needed something or some information or whatever.  And the teller wouldn't give it to him.  And I remember asking him, I said, "Dad what's wrong, why won't--why won't she do it?"  And he was just like furious, "'Cause I'm a nigger."  That's the only time I ever remember him even using that word.  But, but the situation was one where he was just so upset about it.  The real take on race in our house was racism is other people's problem.  And you belong anywhere and everywhere there is to be in this world and that, you know, for the most part we just had to figure out the rest on our own.  And I, you know, it worked for us.  If anything, I think coming to a sense of myself as an African American male in a political social context happened later, or late, and was very much tied to the social movements of the time.
Story_ID: 588250
Speaker 1: Do you remember the March on Washington?  You--you'd been in junior high school [J.H.S. 217, Robert A. Van Wyck Junior High School, Queens, New York] back when that--
Speaker 2: Yeah I remember the March on Washington.  Like all kids, I remember Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] assassination.
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 2: I remember King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination.  And you know, and riots didn't make sense to me.  I mean I was (laughter) I was basically looking at it from a capitalistic kind of way.  Just like in that sense, riots didn't make sense to me.  Why are we burning down our own neighborhoods, you know, why, well not understanding that they weren't our own was the nuance that was missing.  But that came later.  And I think, again, having the benefit of thinking both ways gave me a perspective, who knows I might otherwise have not had on all of that.  So I think that we--I did it differently with Jason [Jason Smikle], when we had our son.  And, and they would have been different because his parents are different.  And Renee's [HistoryMaker Renee Ferguson] experience, we often laugh about this and her school experience, her, her social experience as race related to it were completely different from mine.  She went to all-black school with black teachers; they weren't bused.  These were the folks from the neighborhood, of kids from the neighborhood or kids you went to school with.  Mine was completely different.  So in that respect, my son gets the benefit of both of those experiences and the differences that they--that they bring in, in teaching a lesson.  And I, I think it was a good way to be because they wanted us to live in a larger world and be comfortable in it.  My father [Kenneth Smikle] was doing that, he didn't have a lot of role models.  He had to kind of figure it out on his own and he was trying to pass it on to us while he was learning it on his own.  So I think they did incredibly well by us in terms of having to do it that way.
Story_ID: 588251
Speaker 1: Now did you--did you demonstrate any writing capacity when you were a youth?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Yeah (laughter) I think--I remember, remember early on I, I--publishing was always fascinating to me.  I mean of, you know, all of the heroes of all of the African American heroes that there were to have, the ones that I gravitated toward were John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] and Bill Cosby, 'cause Cosby was funny and he was funny in a really different, not like Redd Foxx kind of way.  And, and those, those were two folks whose professional success had a lot of influence with me.  I didn't have--
Speaker 1: I, I just--let's go back to Redd Foxx and Cosby, just for those you are watching us later on, I mean, 100 years from now or something.  But, wha- what is the difference between the two, I mean in terms of what the subject matter?
Speaker 2: Oh with your Cosby, well Redd Foxx was that blue humor as they call it where, you know, you, you took sexual innuendo to the absolute max, all right.  And then got it on record and these were the records that kids not supposed to hear when their parents were having these parties late at night.  But, you know, you heard some of it anyway.  And Wildman Steve and the other comics of the day where race and sex were the core of the humor.  And Cosby was a guy who saw the world or saw a world that was more like the one I saw in--myself in and that humor was a big part of how I navigated that world.  I used humor and my sense of it and I was good at it to diffuse situations, to navigate my way in integrated situations.  To find a place where I could belong in some way as an equal, maybe a little slightly more than equal.  You know, 'cause I could crack on you better than most people, but I wouldn't call you a cracker in the process.  So it, it, it gave me a tool to work with and I admired the way he did it.
Speaker 1: So you were a witty--a witty young man then?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I was a comic genius in my own mind (laughter).  A genius in his own mind as they say.  Now I wa- I was--I was the funny one in the family.  I mean, it got to the point of almost feeling like a responsibility when have family dinners, you know, I had to bring new jokes and routines and stuff like that, yeah.  Yeah I was the guy in that respect.  And--I, I like that roll, it gave me the spotlight for a minute or two or three, rough crowd (laughter).  But, yeah it was--it was a part of my personality.  And I really liked, like my father [Kenneth Smikle], we were both born on the third of the month so maybe there's something to that.  Yeah, he was very much a people person.  One of those early memories that you were asking about is that, you know, we would be driving along and there was--in New York [New York] as you come out of the Midtown Tunnel on the Queens [New York] side, there was a guy in the middle of nowhere in front of the entra- near the side of this vast cemetery was a guy who had this hotdog wagon set up.  And, and I remember my father would stop at this thing every now and then, you know, to get a hotdog.  Now let's face it, this guy is--doesn- doesn't have any secret ingredients, he hasn't cornered the market on a good hotdog.  It was just that he'd get there and start this conversation with this guy.  So I think it had more to do with he was first curious about how could a guy setup out here in the middle of nowhere be making a go of this.  And so he'd stop for that reason and then it got to be okay now I know a little bit about you and you know me, so now I'm stopping and having a chat with a friend.  And that was sort of how he moved through the world and I find myself doing the same thing.
Story_ID: 588252
Speaker 1: So at Cardozo [Benjamin N. Cardozo High School] in Queens [New York], what were your--what were your ambitions when you were in high school, did you have--did you think about what kind of career, I mean, what were your thoughts about career?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be in publishing at that point.  Well I had two careers, I had these two tracks, these two interests.  They weren't even necessarily career tracks.  I liked working with--I combined them to be even more clear about it.  I loved music and I loved publishing.  You know, magazine publishing.  I loved reading music articles, really well done articles, not just like the run of the mill fan stuff.
Speaker 1: In high school you were--you were reading music articles?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  We were--again as--a--as part of that being different kind of thing, there were a cadre of us back in the neighborhood and by now we had moved over to, well it was Queens Village [Queens, New York] where we moved, the other side of the dividing line which was like three blocks, two blocks from us was called Hollis [Queens, New York].  And on our side of the line, the neighborhood was less integrated then it was on the Hollis side of the line.  So, you know, depending on who you wanna impress, you tell people you gre- you moved to Hollis and you grew up in Hollis the latter part of your--of our teenage years.  And if you wanted to tell somebody else you, you lived in Queens Village, you wanted to say that you integrated a pretty well, well developed middle class neighborhood.  And in Hollis was [HistoryMaker] Russell Simmons, his brother Danny [Daniel J. Simmons, Jr.] who we went to high school with LL Cool J and oh, man--
Speaker 1: They are much younger than you then, right, by the time you were?
Speaker 2: No, we were all around the same age.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Russell's brother, Russell went to Springfield [Springfield Gardens High School, Queens, New York]--he went to Andrew Jackson [Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York], then Springfield.  But his brother got in that group, I think his parents [Evelyn Simmons and Daniel J. Simmons, Sr.] who were educators were trying to do the same thing.  Danny went to Cardozo which was a brand new school in Bayside, Queens and definitely considered to be better than Andrew Jackson which was the neighborhood high school.  So somehow that household split, where one went to one place and the other went the other place.  And I'm trying to remember the last, the very last thing you asked me 'cause it sparked a thought.
Speaker 1: No I was just asking the ages of Russell Simmons--and I was asking about those, were they, I thought they'd be, oh younger than you by--?
Speaker 2: Well Russell, yeah, Russell was a--was a maybe a year or two younger.  I'm gonna be fifty-seven or fifty-five, double nickel coming up in a month.  And my brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] was a year and a half, two years younger than me.  You know, how schools kind of float that age thing depending on what month you were born in.  He was just one year behind me in school.  But, you know, Hollis had a lot of great talented ki- folks who went on and did things.  Budd Ellison, who just I found out passed away a year ago, I didn't even know it.  Budd Ellison was Patti LaBelle's music director for, oh man, twenty, twenty some years.  But, you know, I use--we used to tease him all the time because there was a battle of the bands that was held at the Aphrodisiac [ph.], which was right up there on Hollis Avenue, and we had a jazz band and we beat the socks off of them (laughter).  We, we walked away with the--with the prize.  But, you know, they couldn't bring themselves.  I don't know what the deal was, they had too many fans in the house so they declared it a tie after we got their applause.  And they said, oh I don't know what to think, it was flaky.  But we were all friends.  And there were other guys, who, who lived in the neighborhood.  Again, this was a black middle class neighborhood that--where--that produced a lot of folks like that.  I mean in St. Albans [Queens, New York] was where Count Basie had his home.  You know, Randy Weston who was a jazz--
Speaker 1: Randy Weston--
Speaker 2: Randy Weston is a genius.
Speaker 1: --he is yeah, he is a genius.
Speaker 2: I mean he lived in that neck of the woods.  James Brown had a really famous house on Linden Boulevard.  They used to have a black Santa's face on the outside, huge black Santa's face.  Every Christmas used to ride by and look at that.
Speaker 1: Santa Claus goes straight to the ghetto (laughter).
Speaker 2: Goes straight to the ghetto, you know.  And so James left the ghetto and brought black Santa with him.
Speaker 1: And--Louis Armstrong lived in Queens, right?
Speaker 2: Louis Armstrong was more over in the Corona section which was like closer to Flushing then Northern Boulevard section of Queens where Malcolm X was and a whole other cadre of other people (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right Malcolm, yeah.
Story_ID: 588253
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Queens College [Queens, New York] has all of Louis Armstrong's recordings done (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.  It is the college closest to, yeah, where he is.  And you know, it was just a neighborhood just because of critical mass was gonna produce an incredible number of incredibly talented folks.  And I knew some of them, grew up with them.  And you know, music was a big part of, was like a number one love.  I mean, I wanted to be a musician, I wanted to be--again being different, I didn't want to be a musician so much as I wanted to be a producer and an arranger.  You know, (laughter) I wanted to do the charts for a huge orchestra and produce things along the lines of what [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes was doing and what other folks, even Chuck Mangione who, who around that time was, you know, just taking off up in Rochester, New York.
Speaker 1: Was he from around that?  Okay.
Speaker 2: He was from Rochester, New York.  But those in the know knew about Chuck Mangione long time before any of the stuff got on the radio per se.  So yeah, jazz was another way of acting out that difference.  It was harder to learn, harder to play and there was camaraderie, a lot of camaraderie among those that were involved in it.  The bass player in our band, our band was called the Third World Jazz Band [ph.].  And our bass player was our one representative to the music world who went on beyond our little humble beginnings.  He--George Murray was a, a session bassist and went on the road, traveled for a good little while with David Bowie.
Speaker 1: Okay, his name was George?
Speaker 2: George Murray.
Speaker 1: Murray?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, M-U-R-R-A-Y.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I haven't talked to George in a lot of years.  But--and he studied with, with Reggie Workman who played with Trane [John Coltrane] and you know, that old Brooklyn [New York] contingent.  So yeah, we were--we were carving out a little niche in which we networked with a lot of people who were ambitious, talented and didn't quite know what they were gonna do in the world, but had some idea of what they wanted to do in the world.
Story_ID: 588254
Speaker 1: Was it easy to be in jazz when you were in high school [Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Queens, New York]?
Speaker 2: It, it was--
Speaker 1: I mean socially in terms of (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it--was, I mean it wasn't that you weren't in anything else, I mean I came to an appreciation of James Brown in a musical way late- later.  You know, understanding the genius behind James Brown.  And--again it was funny, because my folks [Mary Dobbins Smikle and Kenneth Smikle] were listening to Arthur Prysock, Brook Benton, Joe Williams, Sarah Vaughan, [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson was big.  And so we weren't listening to--listening so much to Jackie Wilson, James Brown, some of the other more classic R and B folks, they were listening to folks that were more associated with jazz vocals in the house or just pop vocals.  So jazz and pop were like first interest for me before R and B was.  You know, came to Aretha late, Temptations [The Temptations] late, whatever late means, and just like, you know, there were--there were more Sarah Vaughan records in the house then there were Aretha Franklin records.  There were--Ray Charles was in the house, but fewer James Brown.  In fact, the first James Brown album we bought in our house was his instrumental album in which, you know, he plays the organ throughout the whole thing.  And it's like oh he oh, the boy's got skills.  Now we got a (laughter) whole new level of respect with James Brown.  And you know, we, we, we didn't just listen to music, we deconstructed it, we talked about it, we imitated it, tried to play it.  You know, our running gag was about Kool and the Gang, you know, it's like that's what we don't wanna do.  I mean, here's a bunch a guys that started in jazz and now they're playing this Mickey Mouse R and B stuff real simple, you know, it's all about whether anybody will dance to it.  And our attitude was, you know, we were deep into our music.  You know, we were listening to Eric Dolphy and Trane [John Coltrane], and Cannonball Adderley, even though Cannon was a little commercial, but you know, he had his--he had his moments (laughter).  And that's--the music sort of served to differentiate again between those in the know and those who don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what were you reading in those days?
Speaker 2: It's funny because biographies were the books that I like reading.  And there weren't a lot of them that appealed to me.  I would sort of read on subjects and try to get my hands on everything I could.  We didn't subscribe to Ebony and Jet in the house, but we had issues of them there.  We bought The New York Times every Sunday.  In fact, my father bought all of the Sunday papers, the Journal-American [New York Journal-American], the Long Island Press, and The New York Times on the weekends, you know, and I have visions of these big stacks of paper because he'd have things that he wanted to save or read later.  And so we had really a periodical reading habit in the house more so than even books.  My father was a book reader.  I remember, though I didn't read them and some not at all, some not until later, but you know, like I said Ralph Ellison, the 'Invisible Man.' I remember a copy of [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory's 'Nigger' in the house.  'Manchild in the Promised Land' was there later (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Claude Brown, yeah.
Story_ID: 588255
Speaker 1: But I was more of a periodical reader.  I loved magazines.  I liked the newspapers a lot.  And, and my main periodical--the periodical that we read the most, we read car magazines 'cause that was a whole other thing coming from my art background.  At one point I really wanted to be a car designer.  I wanted to go to Detroit [Michigan] and do design, was trying to enter the Fisher Body [Fisher Body Corporation] competition where if you were gonna be a car designer, you--that was like entree.  And went from like car and music magazines into Downbeat and what else.  Now my brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey], who is the more po- he was the, the political consciousness of the family.  He was very active in knowing about the social movements, the Black Panther Party, the Operation Breadbasket, the Young Lords, all of those kinds of things.  And then we had things like Ramparts magazine in the house, the Black Panther Party newspaper.  You know, we, we--he--we went out and bought that stuff.  But he did most of the buying on the political stuff and I did most of the buying on the arts and the music, and--but we shared an equal love for that.  And all of these things just kind of came together in who we became and what we do.  I--I'm trying to remember what if--I didn't have favorites so much but it was ab- always about inventing something, creating something.  In high school [Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Queens, New York], I remember, I was working on a student newspaper, but one of the reasons I was--I asked to work--in fact I went about it in an unconventional way.  All the slots were taken, you know, if you wanted to submit an article or whatever that was fine, but I actually wanted to get on the paper and learn the process and all of that.  And it was an integrated--there was one black girl who was on the--Linda [ph.], what was Linda's last name--who was on the student newspaper in high school called The Verdict, Benjamin Cardozo being the judge, [U.S.] Supreme Court justice.  And, and that was it in terms of black presence on the paper.  So I had two ideas, one I wanted to started my own student newspaper, it was gonna be music oriented and I remember I was gonna call it Fourth Track [ph.], which would take, you know, four different types of music.  And I started doing interviews with musicians.  You know, I would--you know, I had a little card catalog of all the music companies and the artists and all of that at home.  And then I was calling and saying, "I write for the school newspaper I wanna know if I could get a copy of So and So album," you know, so I could start getting records.  I worked in a record store, the record department in Mays department store [J.W. Mays Inc.] when I was about seventeen and was around a bunch of guys that loved jazz and a lot of different stuff, you know, there.  So it was always a music connection in whatever it was I was doing at the time.  And then sort of combined that love with a growing love for publishing and wanted to, you know, at some point I wanna do my own magazine.  Then got deeper when the Black Arts Movement really started taking off in the late--mid late--mid and late '70s [1970s].  We got all up in the middle of that.
Speaker 2: Mid to late '60s [1960s] actually in high school yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, mid right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's when it starts, and you're in high school when Third World Press [Chicago, Illinois] is founded and like--when Drum and Spear [Drum and Spear Press, Washington, D.C.] and all the other black presses are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, graduated 1970 and right before all of that.  Yeah all that stuff was, right, taking off.
Speaker 2: It was taking off, yeah.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.  Yeah right.  And we were buying poetry, buying Don L. Lee [HistoryMaker Haki Madhubuti], buying LeRoi Jones--
Speaker 2: Baraka probably.
Speaker 1: Baraka [Amiri Baraka] to be later.  And yeah that swing from music, I remember Frank Kofsky wrote a book called 'Black Mus-' ah man, it was a--it was like one of the first books to look at black liberation struggle and jazz in--in similar context.  The influence or how one mirrored the other or how they both mirrored a social movement at the time and things like that.  You know, these, these were like our touchstones.  These were the things that got us all riled up and gave us something to talk about with each other as, as a bunch of aficionados.  And so the, the--where was I going, I was trying to remember last thing--
Speaker 2: Well, we were talking about the news- the newspaper you wanted to start in context of that I think.
Speaker 1: You, yeah, wanted to start.  I remember once we got--when I got into college, graduated in '70 [1970] and then went to York College [Jamaica, New York].
Story_ID: 588256
Speaker 1: Well, befo- before we get to York College [Jamaica, New York] now, now did you have like a normal social, did you go to prom and all that other stuff or what did you?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Did you run for class office or did you have any aspirations like that?
Speaker 2: Oh that's interesting, well let's see.  Well, I was always a fat kid in school.  So my social thing was like, nah, not happening, but I had friends (laughter).  So, you know, I would still go to things and hang out.  Didn't go to basketball games much, just a couple of times which was really wild because our high school were--the, the first year that team was formed, the second year they went to the state championship.  We had an incredible basketball team and a really good coach [at Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Who were some of the player--did some of the players become famous?
Speaker 2: There was nobody there that went on to become college stars, not that I knew of.  There may have been one or two gu- guys that were like minor players.  Chisholm [ph.] who was our center, he, he did play, I don't know where he went, I only this from the conversations and, you know, when some of us would get together.  Yeah, he played in college and got a scholarship.  But as far as I know, none of those guys really went on--I could be wrong, I've never really checked that out, it's possible.
Speaker 1: I was just asking, just asking, but, you know.
Speaker 2: But, yeah, but high school, well the other--
Speaker 1: Class office that's what we were talking about.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what happened?
Speaker 2: And let me mention this guy because, speaking of being in the right place at the right time with the right people and who they were, Reginald VelJohnson who, I mean, he's--was in, I was in a drama class where the guy went on to play in the 'Die Hard' movies with Bruce Willis and have his--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Danny Glover?  Yeah, no, oh, oh I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: No, Reginald Johnson who was the cop (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Played the cop, right, yes, the cop.
Speaker 2: Right, right and he became this recurring character--
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about another movie.
Speaker 2: --and you know, he, he played on, on stage in New York [New York] quite a bit with [HistoryMaker] Melba Moore and some other folks.  'Purlie' was revised, he was in that cast.  And, you know, I was in a drama class with this guy, you know, we were all friends and stayed friends for a long time.  So yeah, we, we had an interesting group of people in, in high school.  And yeah, I left there with an idea of getting into journalism.  Didn't know how.  I mean mostly I was thinking I wanted to publish my own thing because there wasn't anything really out there that I thought captured what I wanted to do or really was typical or epitomized what I wanted to do, wasn't Ebony, wasn't this.  You know, my father [Kenneth Smikle] was on--he got the first issue of Black Enterprise because he was on a certain mailing list, so I remember seeing that and that became really interesting.
Story_ID: 588257
Speaker 1: High school graduation 1970, is there--is there any particular memory of graduation that stands out?
Speaker 2: Well, not really.  I mean, you know, (laughter) the revolution was still in uppermost of consciousness.  I remember using my artistic skills to create this big red fist (laughter) that I wore on the back of my gown.  You know, it's like my little contribution (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that's interesting.
Speaker 2: You know, well, and I left out the--
Speaker 1: A red fist on the back of your gown?
Speaker 2: On my graduation gown, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you know, everybody--it--that was the tenor of the times.  That was the overarching sign of the times, is that politics, the war [Vietnam War], the Civil Rights Movement, those things got woven into al--almost everything we did, at least for the group of folks.  And again, this is a new high school [Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Queens, New York] in which they're drawing like kids from all over.  Literally all over Queens [New York] to come.  And the kids they're drawing, drawing upon have all, at some point, been tested for having really high IQs, strong academic potential.  So you get them all in this school and you know, it's, it's--stuff's gonna happen.  I mean, it--it's just a given.  There was, predictably, a takeover of the principal's office and--in which--and (laughter) this--this--this thing was like a defining thing about the difference between my brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] and myself.  My brother was part of that group that took over what's called Michelson's office, yeah the Principal Michelson [Ben Michelson].  And it was all about getting their demands for different things, you know, wanting more black teachers, black history, the usual laundry list of things.  And, and I didn't know it was gonna happen, my brother didn't tell me it was gonna happen.  I'm not even sure that they knew it was gonna happen.  And so essentially what they did was, there, there was a black student organization that had been formed and pretty much the vanguard of that group was in the office trying to negotiate these demands.  That he would meet with them said a whole lot about this principal and the fact that he's, you know, come on, when you--when you look between the lines with some maturity about it, who do you send in to be the principal of a brand new high school in a mostly white part of town, but it's like fully integrated, you know.  So this, you know, he clearly had some skills and some sensitivity, albeit no experience with negotiating situations like this.  But what happened, they took the--they took over the principal's office and then the police were called and all the kids got arrested.  And at the point that they got arrested, I was the one that start calling the attorneys, 'cause I was outside of the room.  You know, I managed to go--they put everybody in the classrooms, locked down the school and I managed to get out, talk my way out of the room.  Said well, you know, maybe I can do something blah, blah, blah.  And I got down there and saw what the situation was and I went and called the attorney (laughter).  And then the trial that happened afterwards and everything.  It was all kind of defining for the people involved, because everybody pretty much lived up to who they were or how they saw themselves.  You know, the kids who didn't--who wanted to make a point about racism and racial injustice acted it out in the courtroom, you know.  The judge was harder on them.  All of the kids that were deemed the troublemakers got transferred to another high school.  I think one guy got suspended for X amount of period of time.  The kids who had their parents who knew how to negotiate, i.e., mine [Mary Dobbins Smikle and Kenneth Smikle], their kids got off, everything expunged from the record.  You know, all of that.  So, you know, it's sort of a defining moment for--
Story_ID: 588258
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That seems like it taught you something about how the world works or something like that?
Speaker 2: Very much so, very much so.  That negotiation was possible, and that you could pretty much negotiate anything under the right circumstances.  You know, especially for the--you could see--and, and the whole--the parenting aspects, seeing who the parents were in court of the kids who were the most vocal, the most adamant about being political.  Yeah, it was all very instructive.
Speaker 1: So the poor guys whose parents couldn't speak up got the worst end of the deal?
Speaker 2: And the truth of the matter is, there weren't many parents of the, what was it, maybe a dozen kids that were involved, there weren't many parents who fell in that category.  All, you know, all these kids came from households where the fires were stoked at home in some way.  And kids went out to interpret what was going on at home in their own way.  Albeit the Panther Party [Black Panther Party] became the model for a whole lot of folks with the list of demands, et cetera, and--as well as language.  But, but it was very interesting to see how folks interpreted the circumstances.  And, and even later on in life, we learned that everybody was pretty much true to who they were in that whole episode.  So it was a (laughter) really good learning experience.
Story_ID: 588259
Speaker 1: Now did--you said you had red fist on your robe when you graduated [from Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Queens, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, on my graduation robe.
Speaker 1: Did you really believe or do you think mo- most of your contemporaries really believed there was gonna be some kind of a revolution in the United States in those days?
Speaker 2: I don't think--I don't--you know, it's interesting.
Speaker 1: Or how did you--or what did you envision it meaning?
Speaker 2: It's interesting and it, you know, now that you mention that, that question brings me to a mind about the attitude towards boycotts and economic boycotts to this day and my attitude about that has always been different.  It's--progress is not measured about whether there is an outcome as you define it when you do it, it's whether there's any discussion about the topic at all.  If I get you to talk about something you otherwise would have never put on the front page of the newspaper or anywhere in the newspaper or on the radio or television, I've achieved my goal.  You know, it's a process and if I make you a part of my process successfully then I'm moving forward.  And that's really what you wanna do.  The notion that you--that you measure in wins and losses about, you know, what you change and how much is changed and whether it's changed in the way you'd like to see it change is not the way to look at bringing about social change.  Not for me anyway.  I mean my whole point is, have the conversation that otherwise wouldn't take place.  Get people talking about it where they would have no desire to talk about it or interest in it whatsoever prior to the event.  So in--in--in some ways, the takeover of the principal's office succeeded in that a school in which the principal [Ben Michelson] had hoped to say we got it all under control here, everything is okay, well you don't have it all under control.  There are things that you're not doing, things that need to be done better and somebody is gonna make you respond to that.  If for no other reason just out of the fear that it might happen again.  So we gotta bring about some change.  And that's, that's really what you want and the pundits would say well you didn't really accomplish anything whether we're talking about the March on Washington, the Montgomery Bus Boycott which still in my mind is like the pinnacle of progress achieved through mass means, it's the pinnacle of examples.  Folks who say you didn't do this so therefore, it wasn't a success, they don't--they don't get it, they don't get it.  They're journalists, it's not their job to get it, it's just to explore it.  But that whole period, you know, you know, it's like why wear a fist on the back of your gown, you know, you're--somebody might think you're a Communist.  You might, you know, they, they get to interpret what that means.  Fine, as long as they get to understand that there's something to explore.  That it's not or should not be business as usual, that there should be no discussion about these things.  And the--and the ultimate moment for us in high school about that came when valedictorian, what was Irv's [ph.] last name, valedictorian who was like the most straitlaced, nerdy sort of guy you could ever pull out of central casting got up to give his speech.  And you know, it's been a pretty volatile year with the principal's office takeover and various and sundry other things going on in the world.  The war [Vietnam War] is on, et cetera.  We're all thinking about the draft.  You know, this guy got up and read a speech entirely different from the one that the principals and his teachers had approved for him to read as valedictorian, and that was like his moment.  And that, you know, and what made that moment happen was all of the efforts of everybody else that had preceded it.  You know, he had written editorials in the paper [The Verdict] about oh he didn't think was cool, he thought that people missed the point, that there was a way.  And then he took--
Speaker 1: Why can't we get along?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, why yeah, exactly.  And he took that moment (laughter) to say you know what, I've rethought this and I'm--(makes sound), he had a great line, for years I remembered it, in his speech that was saying something along the lines of: "I can now conclude that being valedictorian in this day and age isn't worth a pitcher of warm spit," (laughter).  Oh man, you know, and then he went on to say if you haven't done this, if you haven't done this, if you haven't done this as an activist for social change.  I mean that was an incredible moment at that graduation.  And the place went nuts.  It just went absolutely wild and the principal had to sit there on stage and pretty much deal with it not knowing how far the kid would go.  But he was cool, you know, he did it his way and he made quite an impact on everybody there.
Speaker 1: I'm glad I asked about graduation.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, I'm glad you did too.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 588260
Speaker 1: I mean it, it, it really paints a picture of the time and what's going on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how did you--
Speaker 2: Another one of those nuance moments.
Speaker 1: --how did you choose a college?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter), let's see.  Well the, the, the true answer is there was this girl that I liked who was like, you know, a childhood friend and we grew up together and all the rest of that.  And I was chasing her.  And she was going to school at a brand new college that was just getting started and it was actually nothing but a bunch of trailers and some--and use of the classrooms at another college, Queensborough Community College [Bayside, New York], which was right across the street from my high school [Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Queens, New York].  So I knew a lot of kids weren't going to apply to go there.  I knew a lot of kids who could get financial aid weren't going to apply there so it wouldn't be competitive.  It was part of the City University of New York system [New York, New York].  And I said, okay well Deb's [ph.] going there and I knew something about it from talking to her.  I said okay that sounds--and it's not--it's new, again I just come from a brand new high school where there were no rules, no traditions, where, you know, we could sort of set the standards and the same thing was true at York College [Jamaica, New York], so I'm like, perfect.  So I applied, got in, went there.
Speaker 1: So York--York College?
Speaker 2: York College of City of University of New York.  And it was--it was great, it was fun, it was fun.  It kind--it out--it out lived its usefulness in terms of what like what I was trying to pursue professionally pretty early on.  And later on I transferred over to Queens College [Queens, New York] which had a great communications department.  It had a radio station, a television studio and I was just trying to get exposed to the other disciplines in media.  You know, I, I, I was interested in journalism, but I was also interested in the other fields and I was trying to navigate the offerings within the City University system and you know, wasn't trying to be too adventurous in terms of leaving home and all the rest of that.  I mean, I liked where I live and the neighborhood and the guys, and you know, we had our band [Third World Jazz Band (ph.)] and, you know, a bunch of stuff.  And our parents were, you know, they weren't hard on us, you know.  So I wasn't trying to leave and go away to school.
Story_ID: 588261
Speaker 1: Went there and then went to Queens College [Queens, New York] and it--and then it turns out all the classes that I wanted to get in communications were oversubscribed.  You know, so I had to talk my way into the class.  So the way that the teacher did it was this--I had to get the 101 course first, you know, the basic.  So the way he would decide who he would let in, was come to the first class and just see--he was saying, "See how you like it, maybe you don't wanna do this."  But really, it was like both of us looking at each other, you know.  So I just went to the class and I was myself.  I was vocal, combative on points and whatnot.  It was a communication class and the guy who taught it was Alan Wurtzel who is now the director of research for NBC.  And I sort of followed his career 'cause he befo- prior to that he was at ABC and he's one of the guys in the industry, he was just like he was in the classroom when he got into the industry.  I think he had actually worked in television for a while and decided to teach for a little while, maybe had a, you know, change of career thing going on.  Haven't had a chance to ever have a long conversation with him, but what he does is what I ended up doing in media.  And I don't have any idea consciously of how he might have influenced that, but I'm sure he did in some way, 'cause he had a really terrific class.  And it gave me a hands on experience with television and, and with radio because we produced our radio programs there.  And that's basically what I was looking to do.  I wanted to get more exposure to all these different things that I was interested in on the media side.  So we started a black student publication in college called Black Eyed Journal [ph.] and it was a newspaper and I turned it into a magazine (laughter).  As again, I love the magazines.  And having done that there, you know, and then the oth- well the other thing that happened was while I was at York [York College, Jamaica, New York], we--my brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] and one other guy, Gerald Gladney who was going to--now my brother was now--I was at York, which moved to the site of where it was going to be permanently situated in Queens back in Jamaica [Queens, New York].
Story_ID: 588262
Speaker 1: My brother went to Queensborough [Queensborough Community College, Bayside, New York] after he got out of Cardozo [Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Queens, New York], the community college 'cause he wasn't sure what he wanted to do and why not, so he just started with a two year college.  And there was a guy he met there named Gerald Gladney.  And the three of us ultimately got together 'cause my brother said hey you should talk to this guy, and Gerald and I hit it off right from the start.  And we wanted to start a black arts magazine.  And there were a couple of things out there at the time that were like models for us.  One of them was Black Creation a quarterly magazine produced by NYU [New York University, New York, New York] where--what, what was Roscoe's last name, Dr. Roscoe Brown [HistoryMaker Roscoe C. Brown] was in charge of it.  It was just--at the time it was the--it was the most professionally produced, most interesting magazine looking at black arts and culture.  Negro Digest was around at the time and Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller] and that whole crew over at Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] was in charge of that.
Speaker 2: Black World I think by then.
Speaker 1: Yeah and Black--he probably had switched to Black World by then yeah, definitely.  And, you know, was taking on the, the black renaissance movement that was happening in its pages.  But, but you know, it was on news print, it was digest size.  Black Creation was 8 1/2 x 11 and you know, on white stock and all of that.  So we wanted to do something like that, but somehow we thought ours was gonna be more commercially viable or different or whatever.  But that was the model.  So we started this thing called Spirit magazine.  And the entrepreneurial part of all this was well how we gonna get the money to do this.  What we did was, we went back to the schools where we had been editors of the black student publications and we knew enough about the process that we became the vendors that bided to print and typeset those jobs now.  And the students we left behind in our--in our place, they were more than happy say look we wanna do the printing.  Say yeah, okay, cool, right.  So we won the bids 'cause there wasn't any (laughter) competition.  You know, they--I--
Speaker 2: So what di- would you take the bid and then subcontract it out another--?
Speaker 1: No we didn't, well--well we subcontracted the printing but we used the money to get typesetting equipment in our office.  And ty- own--having the typesetting equipment meant you own part of the means of production and, and generated some revenue.
Speaker 2: So what did you have the Compugraphic?
Speaker 1: You got it yeah, right (laughter).
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: Every renegade wanna be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The headliner--the headliner and the--
Speaker 1: --publisher, right, exactly had a Compugraphic machine, right.  So we did that.  And, and that's how we got the business started.  Then we kind of branched out from there and then started doing newsletters and other kinds of collateral material for arts organizations.
Speaker 2: About what year is this did you start Spirit?
Speaker 1: This is 1975, '74 [1974] and '75 [1975] that we started this.  So we did the maga- the first issue of Spirit magazine and it was nice, it looked good and had a cover story interview with [HistoryMaker] Herbie Hancock who was, if I could be a musician, the musician I most wanted to be like.  Did a cover story with him.  My brother, Dawoud [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey], did the photography in it.  LeRoy Clarke who was artist in residence at the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York], we had a story on him.  We had a short one act play by [HistoryMaker] Ed Bullins that we printed in there.  And then profile stories on Loretta [Loretta Greene], what was Loretta's, not re- Loretta Devine, why am I forgetting her last name, who played in 'Black Girl.'  I'm trying to remember her name.
Speaker 2: I know who you're talking about.  Devine (unclear).
Speaker 1: Man, I'll get it in a minute, old age.
Speaker 2: I can't think of it either.
Speaker 1: And we did one issue and we're trying to figure out okay how do we keep this going because that--that was first time encountering what it's like to try to put something on the newsstands.  And so, we were still making most--all of our money from the work that we were doing for other folks.  We started a newsletter, monthly newsletter for the Black Theatre Alliance [Black Theatre Alliance of New York], which became a very popular, very well liked publication, working with Peter Bailey who had been an editor at, at Ebony--
Speaker 2: Yeah he would do the--
Speaker 1: --based in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: --yeah the theater roundup for Black World every year.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] A. Peter Bailey, right.
Speaker 1: So we got--we got to meet and work with a lot of really great folks, again sort of en route to learning what it is we're trying to do.  And ultimately I got the idea that, you know, I really liked Rolling Stone as a publication.  You know, maybe the best publication of its generation.  And we used it as a business/physical model for what we wanted to do and created this magazine or newsprint called Easy, a black arts magazine and did that sporadically.  And we never did quite get the business part of doing these things down.
Story_ID: 588263
Speaker 1: Okay, so Easy is different from Spirit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Easy--Spirit evolved into Easy magazine.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. What was the diff- was there a difference in concept, I mean actually?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Just the physical form was different.  One was a magazine on white stock, expensive to do.  The other was a magazine on newsprint.
Speaker 1: So Easy was on newsprint?
Speaker 2: Easy was on newsprint.
Speaker 1: Like Rolling Stone.  Oh yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Like Rolling Stone right.  But we still didn't have advertising sales nailed.  Eventually I figured out how to get a couple ads from folks that I knew in the music business, Vernon Slaughter who was over Columbia Records black music marketing area, was a real friend and, and was the first advertiser we had.  And so got that going, but we just couldn't get critical mass going for whatever reason.  Mostly ignorance, you know, not.  And trying to adhere to certain principles and things that we thought were necessary if this thing was gonna be a success on our terms.
Speaker 1: Well like what?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the, the--maybe the most significant of those was I got a--I had a visit one day from somebody who worked for Alan Patricof.  Alan Patricof was one of the financiers behind New York Magazine.  And somebody had seen a copy 'cause we penetrated the subway newsstands.  We'd hang the magazine on the side and we were--we were doing really good, we were selling like five thousand, six--seven thousand copies on those newsstands of each issue.  Still going, going fast enough to get it out every month, but you know, we'd do it and then get it on those newsstands.
Speaker 1: Now did you get distribution from a central distributor for those or did you have to go around to every newsstand?
Speaker 2: We went around and created our distribution system one on one.
Speaker 1: That's the hard way (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah it was, but we owned it and we got a better return from doing it that way.  And, and we were learning more than we would have if we had just turned it over to somebody.  That would have been a struggle in and of itself just getting somebody to agree to do it.  And, and then we wouldn't have made any money.  At least this way, we were getting cash flow because guys would run out and they'd call us up and say can you bring some more.  We'd go and collect the money from that.  So we had a little cash flow going.  We were still doing other things.
Story_ID: 588264
Speaker 1: And, you know, it got to be hard (laughter) at that point.  And so eventually, Gerald [Gerald Gladney] got a job as--he was the book guy, he was knee deep in the world of literature.  And he got a job as an editor at Doubleday [Doubleday and Company Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Company] and then Scholastic [Scholastic Corporation], but he--we always had the office.  And while we were doing this, I got a job as arts editor for the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] because Jean Carey Bond, who was the editor, was tired of the hassle there, so she called it, and wanted to know, said I'm gonna leave here and you know, you're doing Easy and it looks great and everything.  I know this isn't what you wanna do really, but maybe you wanna think about taking this job.  And I said well maybe I should think about taking the job.  So this was literally the first job that I had that wasn't of my own making (laughter).  You know, left college like at the beginning of--right at the end of my sophomore year because I thought this thing could take off and really be something.  So we had given it oh like three years now, and it wasn't where it really needed to be.  You know, we weren't where we needed to be financially.  So I said okay.  So I said okay well are they looking for somebody.  Said well--ju- just come and talk to the publisher.  I'm gonna talk to the editor first and see what he says and so Bryant Rollins was the editor.  Bryant was a pretty well known writer then working as an editor of the Amsterdam News was no small thing.  It, it was like the, the country's leading, most prominent black newspaper at the time.  This is like 1978.  And Bryant was trying to make changes.  He was trying to update the paper, bring it up to modern standards.  It was still a broadsheet at that point.  He was, you know, trying to see what else we could do.  Get a different flavor for it.  So he said well I'm gonna call the publisher, John Procope, and have you come talk to him.  And so I went and talked to Procope and I didn't, I said, you know, the idea of begging for this job didn't appeal to me at all.  You know, I was too cocky and arrogant to do that.  So I, I brought copies of the publication we were doing.  And so when he asked me for my resume that's what I pulled out and put on the table.  And he said, "Oh you do this, well okay what's your role?"  I said, "I do everything.  I write, I typeset, I lay it out, I sold whatever advertising we get, I do the distribution on it."  So he found that really fascinating.  He hadn't met anybody that knew all aspects of the business like that before.  And he said, "I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to hire you--I'm a hire you and I'm going to give you twenty-five thousand dollars a year and we're gonna do some things. I've got plans for you."  Well, part of what he was planning was that he knew that there was a strike being discussed among the union workers there and what better guy to have to keep putting the paper out than me, soon to be strike breaker arts editor for the Amsterdam News.  So I took the job and I probably gave them more than they bargained for, 'cause I immediately set about changing the whole paper, 'cause I knew that's what Bryant wanted to do.  So I set up a new production method to--so it could go from tabloid--from broadsheet to tabloid and a whole host of other changes.
Story_ID: 588265
Speaker 1: Well, let's see where were we--we were--oh okay, you're at Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] now, Amsterdam News now?
Speaker 2: So it, it was--working at the Amsterdam was a really great opportunity because--
Speaker 1: This is 1978 we're talking about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1977, '78 [1978] yeah around there.  I was, you know, getting the opportunity to work on a black institution which is what the Amsterdam was, is and to make some really (pause) far reaching changes.  I mean the things that got started when I was there, things that stayed in place for a long, long time, but obviously it's still a tabloid, which was really an important evolution for the newspaper.  It, it needed to move into that model because everybody was doing it.  It gave them a better control over production and the economics of producing the paper.  The arts section, which I completely revamped, had a cover of its own now with these large front page photographs kind of similar to what you see on N'DIGO here now and that hadn't been done.  But folks were taking those covers and hanging them up and you know, just keeping them forever because they were such a dramatic visual piece.  And the imagery was like everything from George Clinton to King Tut (laughter) you know.  So--
Speaker 1: New York [New York] had such a rich cultural life.  I mean, in every--I mean in the black--in terms of the black arts it's just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you mentioned Black Theatre Alliance [Black Theatre Alliance of New York], Hazel Joan Bryant and them.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And all the other.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Do, do you remember Black News out of Brooklyn [New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: I can't remember the--
Speaker 2: Les Campbell [Leslie Campbell] and yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh, Jitu Weusi.
Speaker 2: Jitu Weusi as he came to be called.  Yeah, I actually had some dealings with him (laughter) at one point.  But yeah, all of that stuff was, was inspiring because it, it, it said that people wanted change, that they were abl- they were willing to be entrepreneurial and creative about it and just go out and do it whatever, by any means necessary.  So it was great to be able to do that with the Amsterdam to change the look to make it--the paper more respectable to a generation of folks who didn't relate to it just by virtue of its history, but you know, who were really looking for information, inspiration about the political, cultural, social life of blacks in New York.
Story_ID: 588266
Speaker 1: Did you get any negative feedback from politicians or businesspeople that were used to seeing it in the same conservative, you know, kind of way?
Speaker 2: No actually (laughter) the resistance that I most remember, the only resistance that I remember was among staffers because like at a lot of black companies and institutions and organizations, the folks who are there are folks who are very dedicated and have been keeping the thing going at great sacrifice to themselves.  And they're no- usually not willing to change.  One because they're scared, they don't know any other way to get it done.  We finally found a way that kind of works, we wanna stick to it.  Well me undoing the whole paper [New York Amsterdam News] from the way it was laid out and looks to what it covered, I'm--I was always bumping heads with somebody.  Well, you know, it was nice to go back there, you know, like ten years later and folks say, "Oh this is the guy that changed everything."  You know, the--to be greeted with such an admiration, love and respect and to see them continue on with what we got started.  I mean, they weren't even doing their own typesetting in house.  You know, they were paying to have the printer do it.  I'm like, "You guys, I mean, we could be creating jobs, we could have control over our process, we could do things in a more timely way, we could do breaking news as we're going to press.  All we gotta do is control this one little thing.  And if me and my, my little company of two guys can do that, there's no excuse for you guys not to do it."
Speaker 1: Yeah, those were the days when the means of production were becoming more accessible.  As you said with the Compugraphic machines--
Speaker 2: Exactly, when the technology was changing the nature of--
Speaker 1: Those Compugraphic machines changed a lot of--changed a lot of stuff.
Speaker 2: Changed everything, made a lot of things come to fruition in print.  Gave people the power of the press in--in ways that, you know, economically speaking just would not have been possible before.  So it was time for them to enter that era and, you know, I was glad to be able to play a role in that.
Story_ID: 588267
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long did you stay at Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News]?
Speaker 2: I stayed there about a year and a half, two years, yeah, not, not more than that.
Speaker 1: Well what happened, there's a lot change going on and what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a lot of change.  We adverted the strike.  I became--as the newest hire, I ended up in the middle of being a bargaining chip.  You know, the folks in the union wanted my position to be union and they had agreed to this temporary status in which I didn't have to join the union right away.  But in exchange for that, they didn't want it to become the norm, they didn't want it to become the first domino to fall on nonunion positions at that level within the newspaper.  So there was a negotiation which I didn't participate in other than one conversation, you know, in which I just told them, "You know, look don't harm the paper.  Get more but don't harm the paper.  You gotta figure out how to get a little bit of what you want regardless of how much you think you can get.  You know, I'm telling you as somebody who tries to run a business it's not as easy as it looks.  But find a way to get a little something and keep the paper going," you know.  And, you know, they were clearly not going to let the paper die.  There were too many political interests and financial interests that were tied to the paper.  They probably just as soon got--gotten rid of everybody and produced the thing off site in Jersey [New Jersey] somewhere to keep it going as long as they can keep the advertisers happy and get something on the street.  But one of the things I've learned in having these experiences working at other places has taught me this is that team is everything.  That your people are really what matters most.  And you've gotta find a way to make them an integral part of a winning equation.  So I, I took that lesson with me when I left there and left there thinking that okay, that experience has taught me enough for me to try to go back and be entrepreneurial again.  And so we had never closed our business.  As a matter of fact, the irony was, we were producing about a third of the arts section in my office (laughter) which I still had.  We were in the McGraw-Hill Building which was a landmark building down on 42nd Street [New York, New York].  We got that building through Black Theatre Alliance [Black Theatre Alliance of New York].  Theatre Row was the economic development project that was going on for the west end of 42nd Street and they were building these theaters and offices for these groups. BTA was one of them and those who were going to move into new headquarters were offered temporary space whi- so they could save some money and be close to the development site in the McGraw-Hill Building which Group Health Insurance had taken over.  So they said well we don't wanna move, we're close enough, you know, but we got some guys, some young guys that are doing our publications, newsletters and whatnot, maybe they wanna do it.  So that's how we got the office space there in the old McGraw-Hill Building.  And worked out of there and kept that office even while we were working for other employers.  And we kept--and at night we would come back to the office and just like go over, say okay let's work on the plan, let's keep going with this.  And, you know, it was--it was a great experience, lot of camaraderie and we, we, you know, got--it gave us our head if you will.  You know, a way to test our own ideas and, and concepts about business and our take on the arts and, and how to write about it, how to be involved in arts journalism at a time when that was, if you want a nonprofit organization or didn't have the resources of a Johnson Publishing Company [Chicago, Illinois] behind you was really difficult to do, but really important to do.  And our idea was to do for black arts or with black arts what Rolling Stone had done with rock and roll.  That it was the defining thing in the culture for a whole new group of people that--just like the music reflected the times and the attitudes of the people of, of that generation.  We thought that black arts were doing the same thing in reflecting the politics, the economics and everything else about African American, not just civil rights, but a redefining of, of African people in America as, as that was expressed through culture.  But nobody was writing about it, at least to our satisfaction in the way that we wanted to do it.
Story_ID: 588268
Speaker 1: Yeah I know there's dialog in the '70s [1970s] in Black World about, you know, whether there's a black aesthetic or not, that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, right.  The whole black aesthetic movement was going on in the AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] and you know, with the AACM [Association for Advancement of Creative Musicians] was doing here in Chicago [Illinois], you know, those things needed to be written about and brought to a larger audience.  So that's what we wanted to do in a format that could make money and be a viable business.  We tried and I think it, it wasn't that that idea wasn't viable, it's just we were young, green and learning by the seat of our pants how to do it.  And publications that came along later like Emerge in particular were the beneficiaries of those of us who got to, to do that to have that experience.  I remember when I was at the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] our--my intern was Nelson George.  And Nelson used to occasionally eat lunch at my desk in my little cubicle.  He'd sit on the other side of the desk and he'd talk about movie reviews and things he wanted to write.  Oh man (laughter) it was just--you know, think about what Nelson became.  And then went I went to Record World which was Billboard--Billboard magazine's competition.  I was a black music editor there and you know, me, I'm too entrepreneurial so they were ready to get rid of me after a few years.  Well Nelson was the guy that replaced me in that job.  And I remember him being so awkward about coming, I said, "Nelson, do a good job, you're capable of it.  Just keep this train rolling, you know.  I--I love what you do as a writer, how you think and hip hop is coming in and you're all into it and I'm not.  They need you up in here.  So don't worry about it.  I got--I know what I wanna do."  So for somebody like Nelson to come behind me and pick up the mantle and do the job and take it to the next level and all the things that he's doing in television and film, as well as books.
Speaker 1: Now I think we can, you know, you can see that he's been nurtured somewhere and you know, I mean this is--really he's somebody that--that has--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't credit for that.  I think we all nurtured each other.  I think we gravitated towards each other and towards situations where we all could be together doing stuff.  You know, trying to make it happen.  And we were pioneers in the sense that we knew we had to create those situations for the most part.  That mainstream media wasn't what we were trying emulate so much as to bring something new to the table that could become mainstream.  And that's what happened.  I mean that's what hip hop is.  Started outside of the mainstream and then became mainstream.  And to a lesser extent, jazz from that era, black music, you know, 'cause we--we'd be getting away from the term jazz then.  You know, that was a definition that came with a lot of baggage.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we called it great black music.
Speaker 2: Great black music was what it was, right.  Which was why I insisted upon being the black music editor at Record World as opposed to the R and B editor like my prese- predecessor was.  You know, so we, we tried in everything that we encountered to bring that kind of change or mindset with us.  And you know, I think that's what happened.
Story_ID: 588269
Speaker 1: So how long did--did Easy hang on, I mean?
Speaker 2: Oh, well we did about five issues, you know, over a couple of years, you know.  It didn't hang on very long.  I'm glad that people still remember it.  You know, that magic word potential (laughter).  You know, it certainly had a lot of that.  And it's funny because, you know, years later, in fact just this last year was the first time I got the opportunity to tell Fred Beauford who was the editor of Black Creation at NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  He knew about Easy and Target Market News and the things that I have been doing and I said, "Well Fred you're the reason, you're one of the big reasons any of that stuff got started," you know.  And he said, "Oh you're kidding."  I said, "No man, I--I can--I can quote you layouts and articles and things that Black Creation was doing right now, go ahead, test me," (laughter).  "Yeah, you remember the one with the rainbow on the cover," (laughter), you know.  And so he, you know, he was very bowled over by that.  But--an--and I've been fortunate to have the same experience with folks who said, "Oh I remember you guys were doing Easy magazine man, oh whatever happen--boy that was great and--," you know.  If, if it put somebody a little closer to that shared reality that we were all hoping for and they were able to take it a little closer to reality than we were, great, great.  I'm very pleased, proud to have been a part of that.
Story_ID: 588270
Speaker 1: Well, the next thing I have on my outline here is Black Enterprise.  So, but I mean, is it too soon or to talk about Black Enterprise.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I mean, well after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's 1984, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, what I started doing was trying to really learn more.  You know, I mean that was--Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] was my first job (air quotes) where somebody else was signing my paycheck.  So I said well I le- really do need to expose myself more to business.  You know, I was trying to do this in a different sort of way, a journeyman kind of way.  So, yeah, there were a lot of other things in between that followed that.  Lot of other experiences.  Some of them weren't genuine jobs.  But they all came into play to where I am right now.  The things that we--well the thing that immediately followed that was oh, let's see, actually Sun Myung Moon, Reverend Sun Myung Moon did a newspaper for Harlem [New York, New York] and somebody that I knew said hey you should go down there and show them how to do that, you know.  I said are you kidding, working for the Moonies, you gotta be kidding.  Said yeah, yeah, but no really the folks that are doing the papers, just one person down there that's really, you know, this young black woman, Kathy [ph.].  And so I went down to check it out.  And it was--it turned out to be fun because the guy gave me an opportunity to get some more of these ideas that I had about doing newspapers graphically and production methods, testing them out, gave me a chance to try those things.  They were doing a weekly and it was fun.  So I did that for a few months.  And then oh gee, went to--oh worked for--with [HistoryMaker] Terrie Williams.  Terrie before she became known as this publicist to the stars and as this writer of motivational books and as a motivational speaker, was working at the Black Filmmaker Foundation with Warrington Hudlin.  And from that, she ended up working as an executive director, the first executive director, again it's all about these startups, I love them, was a organization called Black Owned Communications Alliance.  And BOCA was an effort to sort of galvanize consumers to use their--black consumers to use their consumer power in more discriminating and impactful ways.  You know, you're trying to incre- increase black consumer consciousness about the role between your dollars and advertising in black media, job opportunities for African Americans.  And so she, she worked at that and I sort of assisted her with it.  You know, we'd become friends and I knew, knew her when she was working at the Black Filmmaker Foundation.  So I just started hanging.  I said oh this is great because you got Inner City Broadcasting [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation], National Black Network, Essence, Black Enterprise, all these guys are plugged into this thing as the backers of it and so it was a chance to interface in some way small for the role that I had with them, kind of getting on, see what's going on.
Story_ID: 588271
Speaker 1: This about 1981 or something like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she did that for a while and the only thing missing from that equation is--was the Internet.  A way to really reach people and then having reached them galvanized them into some kind of programmatic effort.  But it did help increase in awar- awareness and it was the--maybe the largest effort other than what black newspapers have tried to do of late by being vocal about the lack of advertising going to black media, to black owned media.  And the experience was incredible for me to see these guys working on that aspect of the--of, of their businesses, and it's something that I would later take with me and try to impact on as well.  So Terrie [HistoryMaker Terrie Williams] went from there to the CEBA awards and I followed her there as an assistant working on her staff.  The Communications Excellence to Black Audiences awards, was like the black Clios [Clio Awards].  The Clios were given out for advertising and the CEBAs were given out for black oriented advertising and media too.  And CEBA was incredible in terms of the--the, the people, the talent, the impact, the recognition that it gave to folks.  I was--I was a media maven at this point wh- you know, I'm trying to do, see, learn as much as I could about black media across the board.  And I, you know, wasn't even quite sure where I was going with all of this at the--at that point.  I was still thinking about doing Easy magazine again at some point.  My brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] and Gerald [Gerald Gladney] had both gone on and gotten jobs, but we, you know, we were still talking to each other.  We had the office up until about '79 [1979], '80 [1980].  But you know, we would still--and we still had the equipment, never got rid of that.  So I was just learning what I could, taking advantage of these opportunities and I guess building my reputation in some small way with these folks.  So CEBA awards was the next step.
Speaker 1: That's CEBA, right?
Speaker 2: C-E-B-A.  And that put--that put me in touch with everybody in the business.  I mean, the awards that came in were from everywhere, from black radio stations, black magazines big and small, some black newspapers 'cause you could submit your media kits and things like that, so.  And then the awards dinner was like the event in the--in the black media circle.  The annual event, a must show.  And here I was, you know, like one of the producers of the show.
Story_ID: 588272
Speaker 1: I know it was a big deal here in Chicago [Illinois] with Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] and Vince Cullers and their agencies here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, right.  Everybody gravitated to New York [New York] for these awards.  So I was writing the script for the CEBA [Communications Excellence to Black Audiences] awards.  They hired somebody then didn't work out 'cause at first, I don't know, they just didn't get it and I volunteered to write the script.  And then the second year they paid me to write the script.  And in the back of the CEBA Journal [CEBA Exhibit Journal] was this black marking information section that listed the very same things, but in much, much smaller context that I do now in The Buying Power of Black America report, how much blacks spend on this, various industry information, black on media lists, things like that.  That's where Target Market News got started, working on that section and sort of visualizing the possibilities of man this whole section, in and of itself, could be blown up to do so much more.  So went from CEBA and, and followed Terrie [HistoryMaker Terrie Williams], who left CEBA.  They hired another executive director and she went to Essence.  She was offered a job to be head of public relations for Essence.  So I went over to Essence as her assistant.  And so now I was working, you know, one on one with some of the folks like Clarence Smith and Ed Lewis [HistoryMaker Edward Lewis], and [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor.  You know, helping write press releases, helping to write things for the media kit, so forth.  It--I mean it was a temporary and a part-time job 'cause I didn't really have secretarial skills (laughter) and that's what she needed.  But she was nice enough to let me come over and kind of get exposed to all of that and help her set up her department.
Story_ID: 588273
Speaker 1: And so I went from that--from working at Essence to getting a call to work at The National Leader in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And while I was at CEBA [Communications Excellence to Black Audiences] and BOCA [Black Owned Communications Alliance], Ragan Henry who was a lawyer and a broadcast entrepreneur, black, and had had built a chain of radi- small chain of radio stations, was now getting ready to do a weekly national black newspaper.  And I heard about this thing and you know, managed to get a copy of like the first issue.  And so I was sending ideas about, I mean whole page layouts of things that you could do to kind of pump this up and make it a little more exciting and you know, especially the arts coverage, you know, maybe do this like that.  And are you guys doing your own typesetting and you know, what are your production methods like.  And so, they said well we'd love to have you as a freelancer if you wanna do that and I said okay.  You know, but I really didn't have things that I was interested in doing freelance stories on.  I wanna be involved in the process.  I mean this was like a history making paper.  They were doing this at the same time that USA Today was just getting off the ground.  So I wanted to be a part of it.  And I, I got to--I got the confidence of Ragan Henry which was, you know, really interesting.  This would be like the third or fourth black millionaire in media that I get an opportunity to have some kind of one on one with.  And so he said, "Well I don't know where this is going, where--we need second stage financing now and if we don't get it, then we're probably gonna have to shut down."  And I said, "Well look, just promise me that just before you shut down you'll let me come in and see if you can hire me for like just a week or whatever, you know, we just work out a flat fee or something. Let me try to see if I can try to formulate or revitalize it."  So he said, "Okay, all right."  I didn't take him seriously, but he did.  You know, Claude Lewis who was--who had been an editor and columnist at The Inquirer [The Philadelphia Inquirer] over to do--was hired to come over and do The National Leader, and he decided that it wasn't working out and he was gonna go back--he had an opportunity to go back to the daily newspaper.  So he did that--was gonna do that.  And then Ragan called me and said, "Well you said you'd be interested in trying something, so if you wanna come down here and give it a try."  So I'm like, "Oh great, fabulous."  So, you know, we--the first thing I did was put out this press release that I'm gonna be, you know, the new editor and whatnot.  I was trying to get him to give me the publisher title because I wanted to have control over the process but, you know, he treated me like the brash, but respectful guy (laughter) that I was.  And just kind of said okay look, just go slow, yeah, I'll support you on this, but you gotta give me this, you gotta give me that.  So again I, who had an entrepreneurial not an employee kind of mindset, and that was an important experience to learn how to work with your money source.  And so we did--we did three issues in this again Rolling Stone magazine or newsprint kind of format for The National Leader.  They weren't--you know, little by little got to be more in terms of the substance of the content and we did Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] on a cover and ran into a whole bunch of problems with our distributor all of a sudden (air quotes) and controversial things like that.  But it was a great experience.  Hadn't conquered the ad sales portion of it so, but without doing that, it wasn't going to be possible without second stage financing to keep on doing it.  But right around the time that the end was coming on that, I got a call from Sheryl Hilliard [HistoryMaker Sheryl Hilliard Tucker] at Black Enterprise who knew what I was doing and thought that I might be able to give some consulting advice to Black Enterprise.  Well that ultimately turned into an offer to come down and be senior editor of BE.  I had to take that job.
Speaker 2: This is 198- (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's 1984.
Story_ID: 588274
Speaker 1: The Enterprise.  To boldly go where no man (laughter) has.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Laughter) Okay. We have speed.
Speaker 1: Yes, the Enterprise.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Black Enterprise, in 1984.
Speaker 2: So in '84 [1984] while I was still at The National Leader, I got a call from Sheryl Hilliard [HistoryMaker Sheryl Hilliard Tucker] and she and I used to just exchange ideas, you know, about publishing and things that she wanted to do with Black Enterprise and I would just suggest different things for her to try, different editorial tricks and what have you.  So eventually out of those conversations came a job offer. And I wasn't sure what I was gonna do next with The National Leader closing down.  And I hadn't worked on a coated stock magazine before.  So it seemed like, yeah, I couldn't pass that up, I mean.
Speaker 1: You said a coated sto- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Coated stock, meaning that it's on what we all call glossy paper.  And just learning the production requirements for that kind of magazine.  I done a lot of work on newsprint, had worked at trade publication, worked at Record World and working at Black Enterprise was really, like had I knew about the magazine from the very beginning 'cause my--my father [Kenneth Smikle] was getting it because his name was on that list of people, African Americans, executives, he was getting it because of his position as a manager in the electronics industry.  So I'm not quite sure how that happened, but so from day one I--I've been watching Black Enterprise grow.  And it was funny because every December they would do an arts related issue and Ed Towles who was the art director always had a lot of input in, he was responsible completely for how it looked and had a young staff that used to feed ideas about what to do.  That December issue of BE became the new model for those of us who wanted to do arts journalism of the thing to be--the thing to be most like.  So the whole idea of going there was just irresistible, very exciting.  Once I got there, there was a whole lot that I had to learn.  BE was a very well run, well managed, well thought out business.  And you know, to be working one on one again with Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.].  I think at that point, the fifth black millionaire in media that I got an opportunity to work one on one with was a great learning experience, invaluable.  I don't know that where else I could've learned some of the things that I learned about, a business and the whole industry.  So, my main job there was, was trying to introduce--managing some of the--managing the departments in the magazine and trying to introduce new editorial systems to make it work a little more efficiently.  It was a pretty good system to begin with so that was no easy feat to make it do better.
Story_ID: 588275
Speaker 1: And I also gave--'cause all of the editors wrote as well there [Black Enterprise].  So I gave myself the media and marketing beat to write about.  So I did cover stories on what was going on with BET [Black Entertainment Television].  I did stories on the black ad agencies.  I did story on [HistoryMaker] Reuben Cannon with Oprah Winfrey, first time the Oprah appeared there.  It was around a story on successful African Americans working in Hollywood in television and film, and Reuben Cannon was the person responsible for bringing Oprah to a wider audience.  We wrote about the success of Oprah's show, 'A.M. Chicago,' and so they tracked her growth as an entrepreneur as well.  So it was a great place to be and a great time to be there.  It was a young, energetic staff, and you know, one or two of those folks are still there, [HistoryMaker] Derek Dingle, and they do a great job.  And it really completed my education in publishing.
Story_ID: 588276
Speaker 1: You know, I had an opportunity to see the best in operation.  And if there was anything that I still didn't know is that I didn't have a whole lot of experience doing advertising sales for a publication like that.  But, my other interest got me real close to that.  And that was in--you know, after Easy, one other idea that I wanted to explore as a publisher, as an entrepreneur.  And what I realized from my experience of Black Enterprise is that there were millions, tens of millions of dollars changing hands among black media companies and ad agencies and, and the corporations that, you know, paid those bills.  But none of the trades were writing about that.  You know, there were occasional issues of Advertising Age that would look at, you know, black spotlight or when they do a list of this and that magazine and whatever, pretty superficial stuff.  Didn't look at the business, but the kind of depth that we looked at business at Black Enterprise.  So my idea was to do a publication that was a trade publication that looked at that end of the business exclusively at African American marketing and media.  And that's how the idea for Target Market News got born.  Sort of a combination of the stories and the learnings from Black Enterprise coupled with those things going back to the CEBA [Communications Excellence to Black Audiences] awards that I could see happening in the industry and the things that were put together to create the CEBA awards journal [CEBA Exhibit Journal], especially that back of the book section.  And nobody had done this before and I, you know, just wondered if it could work.  Was there going to be enough advertising support.  And the great thing about being at Black Enterprise that made that opportunity even thinkable was that I was having, through the interviews and stories that I was doing, one on one conversations with Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell], with [HistoryMaker] Byron Lewis, with John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson], who I first started talking to as an editor at Black Enterprise and who I had--who, you know, here you are getting to do stories about your heroes and John Johnson was certainly it.  And so I still wasn't quite sure if the concept could work and so I started looking at the white counterparts that I had hoped to emulate and had set myself up in meetings with Rance Crain who was responsible for Advertising Age and Crain's New York [Crain's New York Business] and Crain's Chicago [Crain's Chicago Business], certainly some of the most successful business publications there ever were.  And had meetings with him.  Even talked to him about the idea and he was enthusiastic and encouraging, and his take was, "Well I don't know if you could do this on a monthly basis like you wanna do, maybe you start out as a quarterly."  I said, "Well you and I know suc- there's no such thing as, as quarterly news.  It's got to at least be monthly if it's gonna be timely in any way."  So we talked about it some more and we sort of left it there and I'm like, there's gotta be a way for me to do this on my own.  The only thing that Ad Age had that I didn't have, or so I thought, was the industry list of people to send it to.  And you know, obviously they had the back end production stuff.  But I wasn't even sure what I was--what kind of partnership I was asking for with him.  I subsequently had a conversation where I just called up, got a number for Clay Felker.  And Clay Felker was the person that created the city magazine as we know it today.  New York Magazine was his baby, and you know, he--Clay was the man.  He, he had really revolutionized journalism, not just the city magazine, but journalism of politics, of social life and all of that with a whole new formula.  And he was nice enough to take a meeting with me and I just talked to him about some of the ideas I had and I said, you know, you know this industry and, you know, he was just very encouraging about my enthusiasm to do it.  And you know, that was probably an entrepreneur's worst moment when somebody you admire tells you, you can do it, just do it (laughter).  And so, you know, you're hooked.  You better make it work because it's gonna be hard when you've heard from the folks you admire that it--there's even a slight possibility that it's a good idea and you're the guy that can pull it off.  You're not gonna wanna give up on that for a good long while.  So, the idea was to go start Target Market News as a monthly publication.
Story_ID: 588277
Speaker 1: And around that same time, my wife now, [HistoryMaker] Renee Ferguson, who we--I met in New York [New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah you met about the same--abo- about 1985 right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.  I was--I was actually--I had this little rep, see I told you I loved music, so I ended up becoming a deejay for the media parties for Essence, (laughter) for Black Enterprise and some of those, you know, things like that around town.  It was mostly those two, and my, my boss had a barbeque and I deejayed her party.  And the folks loved the, the music spin.  Actually what I was doing then is pretty well known now.  It's that all these dusties format where you're playing folks for--for buppies from back in the day for them, so instead of listening to the newest Earth, Wind and Fire or whatever.  We're playing old school James Brown, old school Jackie Wilson and stuff like that.  All of the things that were popular with us like five years ago.  Anyway, I was doing deejaying at the Christmas party that Sheryl [HistoryMaker Sheryl Hilliard Tucker] and her husband, Roger Tucker, had at their apartment.  And somebody had heard that Renee Ferguson was moving from Chicago [Illinois] to New York to work at CBS network.  And they said, "Well why don't you come by this party," you know, that Sheryl and Roger are having and what not.  And Renee and I had this conversation back just before I started working at CEBA [Communications Excellence to Black Audiences].  As a matter of fact, I called her because back in '80 [1980], 1980, something like that, '80 [1980], '81 [1981], I was trying to do a freelance thing with Black Enterprise and I was looking for a story that I could pitch to them and she was doing a piece on [HistoryMaker] Marva Collins in Chicago.  And what some of the parents had brought to her attention about things that weren't quite as kosher as everyone had thought they were.  And I caught her on 'Donahue' ['The Phil Donahue Show'] one morning talking about that story.  And I said oh that sounds like an interesting story, let me go pitch that.  To this day, she swears I was gonna do a hatchet job on her (laughter).  Well it's like no, no, it was just an interesting story.  I wanna see what the story was behind it.  So she and I had this great interview about what she did and then after that we just started talking.  I said, "You know, I've never been to Chicago, always wanted to go there and you know, what do you do there, what's it like."  And so she was telling me about life in Chicago.  And it was just a great conversation.  I said boy that's an interesting woman.  Well, you know, it's like pan ahead years later, here she comes to this party that my boss is giving and [HistoryMaker] Terrie Williams was there.  She said--and she had met her just as she arrived in New York.  And she said, "This is Renee Ferguson. Remember we were at CEBA. You said you knew her, had talked to her about that story you did in Black Enterprise." "Oh yeah, great to meet--you're here now, wonderful, oh you know, maybe we can get together sometime.  And I'm running for president of the New York chapter of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], I would love to talk to you about being on our ticket. We're forming this ticket which had never been done before, running as a block for the four key positions.  And boy you'd be a really great vice president broadcast with your experience and, you know, all your Emmys [Emmy Award] and all of that."  So we went to dinner, had this conversation and you know, soon we were just talking about each other and hey (laughter) one thing led to another.  So yeah, we first met at that party.  And then, we found out that the job that she had at CBS at the bureau was going to be shutting down.  So she--there was a job back in Chicago at the NBC station here, WMAQ [WMAQ-TV], and somebody that knew her on the--on the desk said, "Girl you should call and tell them you're interested in this job."  Said, "Well I just got in New York, you know, met this guy, we're just starting out."  And I told her, I said, "Well look for what I wanna do there are two places that I can do it, yeah New York and Chicago, 'cause that's where the industry is."  Now just before that I came to Chicago to do a story on the black advertising agencies.  It was a cover story for BE and I came here to talk to Vince Cullers, Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell], Barbara Proctor, and some other folks around in the industry.  Took my first trip to the Johnson Publishing building [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois].  Young [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron who was there as a editor of Jet I met back in New York when he was going to school at the J [journalism] school at NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  He came back our little office on 42nd Street and met him.  And I said--called him up and said, "Hey I'm in town." "What not so."  That was my first chance to go into the hallowed halls of JPC.  Everybody that wanted to be a publishing entrepreneur had to make the hajj (laughter) to JPC.  So Chicago was a real surprise.  I had no idea that it was as cosmopolitan a city as it was.  And I said, "Well this would make a great alternative to New York."  Eighteen months after the first time (background noise) I'd ever been here--
Story_ID: 588278
Speaker 1: So eighteen months after my first visit to Chicago [Illinois] ever, we're here (laughter).  We moved here.  And I got started putting Target Market News together as a concept, as a--as a publication and again sort of having that sporadic success where it was something of a good idea, but it's hard to make it catch on.  I mean at the end of the day, trying to be a publishing entrepreneur means that you've gotta have financial resources from somewhere.  And you know, I've been bootstrapping these things all along and coming out of these situations where I worked for some of the best, it was a really stark reality that, you know, it's really hard to, to get something going and sustained like that, especially at the level that I wanted to do it at.  And in the unique way that I wanted to do it.  These are things that nobody else has done before.  You know, but I think it's important that we--that we have more trade publications.  You know, things that look at our unique take on industries whether it's media, marketing, entertainment industry, any professional endeavor needs to have something in which we get an African American story of success--a perspective about what these industries mean to us as a community, as a people.  So I got lucky, because while struggling along to kind of do it as a traditional print publication, the Internet came along.  And that was the perfect salvation for Target Market News.  It allowed me to get the news out to people, allowed me to gather the news that there was a lot more efficiently.  So doing a trade publication online that specifically looked at African American marketing and media issues was plenty doable and kind of paved the way for everything else.
Story_ID: 588279
Speaker 1: The other thing that helped a lot, while trying to get the traditional publication off the ground was realizing the need for research.  That while I was at Black Enterprise we used to get calls all the time from folks saying can you tell me how much money black folks spent on cars.  I need to know, I've got a business plan and the bank wants me to give them some kind of idea what the universe is.  So, you know, I'm opening a boutique, can you tell me about clothes, can you tell me about some of the businesses like that.  And I went to the research department of Black Enterprise and tried to get from them source- sources of information for just that kind of thing.  And the woman who was the head of the research department, boy I'm forgetting Gwen's [ph.] last name, old age, it'll come to me.  Showed me what there was and just opened up a whole new world about research.  And I just took to it.  You know, I love math and I loved facts and figures.  And I love lists of things (laughter).  And here it was, the information that people have been asking about.  I said, well we got, I gotta incorporate this into what we're doing.
Speaker 2: Who compiles that kind of data?
Speaker 1: Well, the number source of data is the federal government.  Nobody compiles more information than they do and because it's the government doing it, that information is available to taxpayers for free.  It's a lot to go through and before the Internet came along it was really difficult to--
Speaker 2: Access it.
Speaker 1: --access it, crunch it, do things with it.  But when the Internet came along, all of that changed completely.  So we started a report called The Buying Power of Black America, twelve years ago.  And it was taking that government data and doing the one thing nobody had time to do with it and that was crunch it, organize it, make sense so that it was readily accessible and you could find the exact piece of information you needed.  And that became like one of the new bibles in the industry.  It became even a bigger deal in terms of our consumers than the news that we were trying to do about the industry.
Story_ID: 588280
Speaker 1: So we shifted gears and started doing and it was just a staff of two or three of us at any given time putting everything together and marketing it.  And we soon learned how to so--put the--put the report [The Buying Power of Black America] together using the Internet and then sell the finished report using the Internet.  We started to build up what I call a community because that's what it is.  That whatever we had, this community was interested in buying it.  So from there, went to conferences in which it was what I called a three dimensional virtual world of the things that we were doing in print.  The researchers, we'd get them to come and do in depth presentations about the latest trends and statistics.  The folks who were involved in marketing programs, we get them to come and dissect those given anatomy of how they went about targeting African American consumers.  And then the media started picking up on the press releases that we generated about what was in the report and fortunately Target Market News became a credible source for information, really the only one operating at that level where you didn't have to pay thousands, tens of thousands of dollars to get it, information about the African American consumer market.
Speaker 2: So, is it mostly circulated online now?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's--yeah, all of it is done online, the entire thing happens online, which is great.  We sell thousands of copies of the report.  You know, we're gonna introduce a print version of the magazine again.  I've been trying to go through these funding scenarios to get backing to do Target Market News as a magazine again.  And I think we're close to that now because we can take advantage of some of the other new opportunities that have happened in the last year.
Story_ID: 588281
Speaker 1: What have you reported that we would be startled about in terms of a black consumer?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's interesting.  One of the things was--the thing that we got the most attention on was the so called digital divide.  We had the research, some of the same research everybody else had about African Americans and their use in relationship to computers and computing.  And the digital divide was a phrase that was coined by Larry Irving, a brother that worked at the National Telecommunications Information agency [National Telecommunications and Information Administration].  He coined this phrase as a way to frame policy initiatives in which the government would do all it could to make sure those who traditionally get left behind when new innovations come along would not get left behind.  We need to call it something.  These folks are part of the digital divide.  The, the digital have nots versus the digital haves, which served public policy well because it helped them frame the issue and get a lot of initiatives through [U.S.] Congress.  You got a focus about how important it was to make sure that people of color is seen and all the rest of those who traditionally get left out of the scheme of things, we're not gonna be left out.  But at the same time, it also painted a picture that somehow African Americans were not viable consumers for new technology.  They don't have it, they're not buying it, they can't get it, they're too poor.  So we did a lot to put out information that said just the opposite is true.  That African Americans are the first adopters on new technology, having always been, whether we're talking about a camcorder, a computer, video games.  We're--they are first, because our relationship with technology is completely different than other folks.  It gives us freedom that we don't have in other arenas of life.  It gives us access to information that we otherwise wouldn't have.  It levels the playing field for us where racial discrimination can create an advantage for those who had a good education and those who didn't have as good an education.  Computers and technology and access to information levels that to something closer to parity.  So that now what you know about a particular topic or what you know about how to spend your money or what you know about political scenarios and circumstances and using that to gather up people, I now have that same ability.  So our relationship to technology as a whole is anything but divided. And we realize intuitively that anything that gives me that kind of control, I want it in my life.  And then the numbers bore that out.  That back in the day when you paid for Internet access through AOL [America Online, Inc.; AOL, Inc.] or CompuServe [CompuServe Corporation; CompuServe Interactive Services, Inc.]  or one of those providers, the research that the government had gathered said that black households spent almost two and a half times what households in general spent to have that kind of access.  Well we know everybody's paying the same price, it's not like price discrimination at the local butcher shop where you pay high prices 'cause you live in a poor neighborhood.  This was, everybody pays the same thing, what that meant was that we were paying more because we wanted more.  We wanted more of the premiums.  On average, we were paying--more of us were signing up in greater proportion then the general population.  So, those kinds of indices and, and data were suggesting something other than digital divide.  And we put that out there and started to change the notion, challenge the idea that technology marketers didn't need to pay attention to African American consumers.
Speaker 1: Now that is startling information.
Story_ID: 588282
Speaker 1: So all that informa- all that information that was available just reinforced for me the idea about how important doing all of this was.  I mean from being at Black Enterprise I got a real strong appreciation for how important the nuts and bolts information about business, about money, about who we are in measured ways in society, how important that information is to get out to people as a way to effect change.  And so media is the way that you get that message out.  So I continue to be enthusiastic about media and--and especially print, but also the Internet.  I mean those are still the two most accessible forms of distributing information.  And now, perhaps, the best way to get out specialized information in a cost effective business model that has a--at least the opportunity to be profitable.  So I--I'm, I'm still very much dedicated to both of those things, print communications and the Internet as a means of communications as well.  But obviously, the one thing you can do with the Internet you can't do with print is to create whole communities where people interact with each other on the basis of their shared interest, their mutual concerns about issues, and their mutual goals and aspirations and learning from each other how to get there.  And that's what is happening now in the evolution of Target Market News or at least how Target Market News serves a larger purpose.  I mean yes, the original idea on this was always to find a way to make money by providing information.  But I'm, I'm--at this stage of my life I really want to see how that information can be packaged, amplified, distributed so that it spurs people to action.  And I've had some examples of late of how that might be possible because there's a dialogue that is not going on that I think would make all the difference in the world for us in how we are perceived in political circles and in business circles.  And that is the dialogue between us and those with whom we want to do business directly with, nothing filtering it.  I try to now find more imaginative ways to encourage people to write to companies.  To write letters, write emails, place phone calls to those that you already do business with.  You know, if you have a favorite brand of breakfast food or if you have a favorite health and beauty aid, you know, whether it's shaving cream or perfume or whatever, something that you have spent thousands of dollars on over the last years--last few years, the question is what has that company given back to you in return.  Well yeah, you got the product, but money doesn't work like that.  Money is the glue of a relationship and relationships are about more than just money.  It's like where are you go--where is this relationship going.  You know, it's like, okay, buying a product and giving you money is a date, but are we ever going to get married and get serious and build something here.  So that's the mindset I'm trying to get black consumers to come to about what they do with this information.
Story_ID: 588283
Speaker 1: Yeah, after I tell you that African Americans spent $300 million last year on books then the next question is, what is the book industry doing for us.  We gave them what they want, we got something of what we want, but the ability to get more and to have a better relationship has to do with accountability on their end.  So you need to write publishers and say how many black editors do you have, how many black authors are you doing business with.  How many more books of African American interest do you see your company doing this year then you did last year because, you know, I just wanna know.  I just wanna know who I'm doing business with.  Love your books, but I wanna love the relationship.  And that's what money is.  It's--money is the thing that says I like the relationship that we have, I agree with it.  You're the kind of person and you have the kind of values.  Your company has a kind of sense of citizenship that I wanna do business with.  Not just I gotta have that car.  No you don't gotta have that car.  You gotta have an understanding with the person you buy it from that if they were discriminating within the company, if they were engaged in unfair practices, no way would you ever do business with them.  And just because I haven't heard anything yet doesn't mean that I shouldn't be asking questions related to that topic, to that understanding.  So that's where I'm hoping we can take this information that we gather to.  That's the next level of, of usefulness, if you will.  It's one--we educate ourselves about what's going on, now we need to educate those that we do business with about how we feel about what's going on.
Story_ID: 588284
Speaker 1: Now you've been at the foundation of some organizations so, I mean, let's talk about some of those (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, other than the information I think the only--the next most important thing or equally as important is getting together to share ideas and then having shared those ideas, taking action where we agree.  So, I've been a member of NABJ, which in media is the most successful black media association that there is.
Speaker 1: It's the National Association of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) National Association of Black Journalists.  Love NABJ because so much happens when we get together.  Change happens, ideas get shared, new ideas, new possibilities, all that happens in varying degrees depending on how our coming together takes place and how many of us actually come together on an annual basis.  But, we are the folks that inform everybody else.  So it's really important that we compare notes with each other that we hold each other accountable.  That we push for change in our industry to make it possible to do what we do better.  And I think NABJ as an institution is solid, that its mission is solid as well, and despite the sort of hills and valleys of our expectations being met and not being met, I think that it--it's there and does a good job.  It needs to find ways to reinvigorate itself and maybe even reinvent itself in light of the media environment that we now work in.  And, and, and, and in light of the role that journalism must play in the future.  And NABJ has sort of been a model for the kind of association that I think other organ- other professionals in the media marketing space should have.  So back in 1990, I instigated the creation of the African American Marketing and Media Association or AAMMA.  And it was sort of taking what was attempted with the Black Owned Communications Alliance to another level, trying to have a trade association that included media, black owned media companies and radio, television, newspapers, magazines, all of that.  Along with advertising agencies and PR [public relations], black owned PR agencies kind of come together to pursue a common agenda.  Well it was hard to find common ground there.  Obviously media is looking at agencies to say ah, you know, where's my ad, (laughter), where's my spot and those kinds of things.  And it was a presidents club, at least initially where you bring together these very successful entrepreneurs and trying to find common ground.  It, it wasn't difficult to identify common difficulties, common enemies, but it was difficult to find common ground on how to address those difficulties.  So, the one thing we did realize that we could do and that is to get more research about the constituency that we represent into the mainstream, into the pipeline.  And there were some efforts with that.  But Target Market News kind of took over that aspect of it and so I'm looking to grow that as part of the legacy of what was AAMMA.  And also involved in trying to bring the advertise- the black owned advertising agencies together and the Association of Black Owned Ad Agencies [Association of Black Owned Advertising Agencies].  And that's still an ongoing process.  But I'm optimistic about all of these things because only in our coming together can we truly assess if we've made progress and how to make more progress.
Story_ID: 588285
Speaker 1: I mean, I think it's really, really dangerous when we become entrenched in our own little worlds in--in our own companies trying to decide whether or not a particular set of facts is true.  You know, we--it's something in this day and age where information flows freely, rapidly and changes all the time, it's really important that we come together and discuss what we need to do, what the state of the world is, what the state of our industry is and how that impacts us.  And I--I'm now of the thought that one of the reasons why NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] is successful and some of these other associations have been more difficult in getting success, is that NABJ has a real focus on the next generation.  You know, the career fair which is a big component is about the next generation and it attracts the young wannabes, the future professionals, young African American kids who wanna be in this business to an event where the older generation is and they can exchange dialog, learn from each other.  So I think in everything that we do when we come together as association, whether it's the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or, or the association of African American book professionals, we have to now think less about our immediate circumstances and think more about doing something for the folks that will follow us.  Because we don't really agree on whether the current circumstances are bleak, some of us have become probably more optimistic than we should allow ourselves to be.  That oh things have gotten better and they're probably gonna keep getting better because I know what I'm doing and you know what you're doing now, and we're talking and we're putting up money.  But it can't just be about us who have arrived, if you will.  It's gotta be about those who come after us.  And whether or not that path is gonna even be there and if so, are we gonna have any involvement in the path that they take.  So I think in order for that kind of action to lead to something positive, it's got to include doing something for the next generation as a big part of its mission.

Speaker 1: You produce an annual called The Buying Power of Black America.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  And it's--how, how many years have you been doing that?
Speaker 2: I've been doing it for twelfth--twelve years.  The next edition we're working on is the thirteenth edition.  Lucky thirteen (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, that' right, that's right.  The lucky--the golden thirteen.  And you just recently purchased, I mean acquired Black Issues Book Review, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And publishing a tabloid kind of spin off of it, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Called Blacks and Books?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Back in March I got a call from Bill Cox who I've known for quite a few years now.  Bill and Frank Matthews were putting--had put together really one of the most successful trade publications in the African American space that there is.  They don't get a lot of attention outside of their arena, but Black Issues in Higher ED [Black Issues in Higher Education; Diverse: Issues in Higher Education] is about twenty-five years old and it is the number one recruitment publication for secondary education African American teachers and educational administrators.
Speaker 1: Yeah, college administrators?
Speaker 2: College administrators, right.  And they are now doing that on a biweekly basis, twice a month.  It started out as a monthly and has grown incredibly.  Very envious of what they built there.  Bill with his love of books, seven years ago decided to launch a black book review magazine and borrowed its name from its sister publication Black Issues in Higher Education and was called Black Issues Book Review.  And it's the only black nationally distributed book review for books by black authors and books of interest to African Americans.  And it was just--they, they, they couldn't find a formula to make it work as a business and called me and said, "You know, you know we're getting ready to expand in other things and we're gonna sell off the college--," Community College Weekly that they were doing.  And they were gonna either try to find a buyer or investor for the book review and did, did I know anybody that might be interested.  And I said, "Oh yeah I know somebody that'd be interested."  So, "Oh really, who?"  I said, "You're talking to him," (laughter), "you know."  You know, we--the magazine was terrific.  In fact a couple of years earlier I got the idea to be doing something similar on the Internet with blacksandbooks.com.  Trying to set up a trade business to business site on black book publishing, but strictly Internet based.  So I had gotten some notion about what was going on, had been thinking about it and the opportunity to do Black Issues Book Review with a team of folks that are involved in it, and they're terrific was an irresistible opportunity.  So we, Renee [Smikle's wife, HistoryMaker Renee Ferguson] and I, decided well, you know, let's make the investment in it, it's something that's important.  It certainly fits the mission that I've tried to live out with Target Market News and doing trade publications and putting out information that would empower African Americans.  What better vehicle then something that's looking at the other way that we get our information through the written word in books.  So we've been doing it seven months and one of the things that is sort of problematic for us as a business is that BIBR comes out every other month.  And as a financial model it's okay and it's ex- expensive proposition to try to increase that frequency.  So in the way I look at things which is imitate, improve, improvise, I'm like why is there no imitation of The New York Times book review.  I said yeah, what if we did a black book review supplement but in black newspapers.  Well folks will love the idea.  The black newspaper publishers love the idea.  Readers love it.  It kind of opens the door for a whole host of other possibilities.  The publishers love it because they're now reaching an audience that they haven't reached before through any other vehicle.  There're very few papers that can devote significant space to the latest books.  And there are hundreds of books by black authors and of interest to black readers coming out every year.  So there really needs to be something that does, in a--in a devoted way, more on what's coming out, what's being introduced.  And we think this will do that.

Speaker 1: Is it difficult to find black reviewers?  'Cause I know that a lot of black writers end up doing some other job because they can't find a vehicle for their--for their work (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I--is it?
Speaker 2: Well, we've been fortunate is that we've had some of the best writers, reporters, journalists, even other book writers, novelists, authors willing to contribute very little money, reviews about titles that they--that they're excited about.  And thankfully this crew has built up a really nice network of those kinds of folks by doing a second publication. Now we'll have an opportunity to publish even more of those and, and make that network more viable and make those opportunities more numerous.  So--and to talk about authors where, you know, you can only do but so much when you're every other month doing like a forty-eight page magazine every other month.  This will allow us a whole lot more space to talk about what authors are doing, what booksellers are doing, black bookstores, everybody involved throughout the entire chain.  And give the industry a jolt, if you will, add some excitement to what's going on in African American book publishing.  So that publishers can now say okay I've got another way to advertise and promote and market these titles, now maybe we can start to put more titles in the pipeline because we're going to these readers.  And what we found out, we researched, is that black newspaper readers are way above average for their book purchases.  That over 60 percent have purchased at least five books in the last year.  So--
Speaker 1: A lot higher rate than the general population.
Speaker 2: It's a lot higher than the general population, right.  So this is a great audience and it--it's really exciting to bring these two things together like this.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ones of us who read the paper are desperate for things to read (laughter).  Read more and more.
Speaker 2: Folks are desperate to get something to read to you.
Story_ID: 588288
Speaker 1: Now, do you have, and I know this is business and you can't reveal all your plans.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But do you have a--do you have a big plan in the works, something that you're dreaming of doing that you've always wanted to do that's--you can tell us about?
Speaker 2: Well most of my immediate dreams revolve around building up Black Issues Book Review and the supplement which is called Blacks and Books. I mean we wanna--we wanna be in a position to have an impact in book publishing like Target Market News just had in marketing and media with conferences, wi- with a presence at the major industry conferences like BookExpo America.  To be involved in all of the things that bring a greater understanding to the wider industry about what's going on in the African American space.  And then to find as many different platforms that are, are workable to distribute the information that we gather.  I would love to see us get involved in radio to, you know, deliver information about authors and new titles and perhaps interviews with authors through radio, through a radio program or a segment within an existing radio program.  Wanna look at what we can do in terms of the technological possibilities with book purchases and all of that.  I'm not even sure where that goes.  I just know that there's a role for technology to make all of this work better.  We wanna build up our website so that we can have a, a way to rapidly deliver new information about things that are going on, you know, good news and bad news, whether it's the passing of great people like [HistoryMaker] Bebe Moore Campbell or the prizes and awards that are given to black authors.  Wanna get that out into the pipeline as fast as we possibly can and the Internet is the best way to do that.  So we're looking forward to building up our Internet presence and our information flow so we can be of more service to readers.  But in a larger way, I mean at this stage of life, my next big dream is making all of this stuff rock solid so that the next crew, maybe my son [Jason Smikle], maybe the heirs of the folks we have working with us now.  You know, for me it's all about who's next.  You know, I think that while I'm able, I wanna be able to pass on the information and whatever I learned and not say well okay, you still got a ways to go.  Well now it's time to see who can take it a little further than I've taken it.  And being able to help them do that is probably the best thing I could do with my time, you know.  It's all about helping the next group to come along.  Like I always say, it's your world, I'm waiting on instructions.
Story_ID: 588289
Speaker 1: Tell me wha- what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: (Pause) (Laughter) I, I, I have sort of macro ideas.  You know, I think it's funny because I think we've addressed and continue to address a lot of the little things.  But my concerns are about the ability for big thinking to take place, for people to come with big ideas that make change happen in large ways, even if it's just to shake up our traditional way of looking at problems, looking at goals.  I wanna see us be in a position that we have a way to communicate big ideas with each other.  And that we find a way to act on them, if possible.  You know, I think that, you know, in my lifetime there have always been the pioneers who set the bar, the John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson], Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.], the Ed Lewis [HistoryMaker Edward Lewis], Clarence Smith, the--in the media arenas, Syd Small.  We're now talking about the folks that are slightly younger than them, where are we gonna leave the bar and what do we think the next group behind us needs to know so that they can actually raise that bar higher, whether it's in politics, business, whatever the arena might be.  And I think we need to--we gotta get rid of the trivial stuff.  You know, we bogged dow- we get bogged down in, in the thick of thin things as one saying goes.  We're still devoting too mu- too much of our collective resources to problems that we can solve if we come together, not everybody, just a few dedicated folks get together and simply solve it.  Just do it.  I mean, yes we've been engaged in struggle in our--in, in a mighty way that is very individual in nature.  You know, to the survival of a business to survival of individuals, trying to build wealth while others are just trying to hang on.  Those individual struggles are, are gonna always be there, but what's the next big thing for us to do, collectively that will change the paradigm in a way that creates a whole new range of opportunities for the next generation of folks.  I think that's where we gotta devote some, some thinking, some dialog where folks need to come together while we still can because, you know, in the next ten years I dare say that, you know, we're gonna lose a lot of the leadership that we have now either, you know, they just make their passage in life or they're just physically not gonna be able to share what they have in the ways we need them to share it.  So we need to start getting their stories, getting their expertise, getting their mistakes, all of that needs to be recorded, studied, discussed so that it paves the way for our kids.
Story_ID: 588290
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there--is there anything, anything major that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well let's hope so (laughter).  If I knew then what I know now, yeah.  Yeah, there, there are things that I would do.  I would go faster.  I think that's the thing that sticks out much.  You know, when you're trying to be entrepreneurial, one of the things that kind of gets you through the difficulty of that is being steadfast to what you believe in.  'Cause after all, why do you want to be entrepreneurial in the first place.  You wanna do something that hasn't been done before in some way, shape or form.  And in the course of doing that, I think that, just me personally, if I had been willing to risk a little more to get a little more done, I probably could've done all of this faster.  Who knows, it may have had a very different complexion.  I think that would've been okay.  You know, I--you're sort of committed to doing a particular thing when you start out as an entrepreneur, and any deviation from that is usually seen as failure or weakness.  And I think as you get older and get more mature about it you realize that that's not necessarily the case.  That if you're moving in a positive direction towards any aspect of what it is you wanted to do, you should take that progress and then go forward.  So, you know, the--if I had had the motto, fail forward fast, a lot sooner, then I think that I would just go faster at what I'm doing.  I, I still see the need to do this.  I still see it as what I'm here to do.  You know, every, every mission.  Every good goal comes from God and this is what God sent me here to do.  You know, I, I think it's the reason I survived a heart attack two years ago.  You know, it's sort of like say okay here's your wake up call.  Whatever you haven't done that you think I want you do, you better get it done quick.  This says time is not limitless and, you know, there's nothing like surviving a heart attack to help you redefine everything you're doing.  It's not that you give up on things.  It's that you start to chip away at what really is not important, what is not the most significant thing in your life.  And yeah, it helps you to focus.  So, for all I know, the opportunity to buy this magazine [Black Issues Book Review] when it occurred is a part of that and I--I'm certainly looking forward to making that work and combining what I had done to what I might do could all be a part of the mission.  But I, I, I see it as all part of the same thing.  And I wanna be able to leave something for--well there was a great quote that Sidney Poitier gave The New York Times many years ago that I saw and he said, "I'm glad I was able to bring dignity to my father's name."  And as somebody who shares his name, you know, my father's [Kenneth Smikle] name, that--that had a lot of resonance for me.  And I think that's what you wanna do.  You wanna leave whatever legacy was handed to you better when you hand it to somebody else.  And our lives are all legacies.  And I think that we need to be very protective of them, but we need to grow them too.  We need to do more, even in the face of setbacks.  We need to try to be better at the point you hand it off to somebody else then it was when it was given to you.  So I, I--for me that's what life is about right now.  And that's what I want to leave my family, my son [Jason Smikle].  You know, I wanna leave him opportunities.  But I wanna leave him something that will inspire him to do whatever it is he wants to do by saying, my old man did this, and when I get ready to do something I want to do that better than he did, what he was trying to do.  Doesn't even have to be in the same arena.
Story_ID: 588291
Speaker 1: What would you consider today to be your legacy basically?
Speaker 2: You know, I--I don't--I don't know.  One of the--and I learned that at the time that I had the heart attack I found out what I meant to people.  You know, the way they came to me.  It was the most humbling and gratifying experience, albeit that I cheated death.  But it was a very humbling and eye opening to see people come to me and talk about oh yeah, you know, if you hadn't been gone.  I mean I've heard so many different things from folks about--(laughter) funny stories as well.  I don't--I don't think we really appreciate or really understand what it is we mean to other people.  And whatever that is, that's your legacy.  I think we all have multiple legacies and the most that we can do is to be good people to live with integrity, to live to be of service to other people and the legacy part will take care of itself.  I talked about that episode where my brother [HistoryMaker Dawoud Bey] was involved in taking over the principal's office.  Well the funniest part of that story was four years later when my sister graduated from the high school [Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Queens, New York], they stood up and gave that same principal [Ben Michelson] a standing ovation (laughter).  So their characterization of him was nothing like our characterization of him.  But clearly he had done something that was true to his core that allowed him to be seen in that way and to be remembered in that way by a completely different group of people.  So our legacies are many.  I think that if you just do the best you can do with integrity and character and do it for someone else with a God driven purpose to it, the rest will take care of itself.

Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family now.  You've talked about your wife [HistoryMaker Renee Ferguson] on some level, but I think you have a son too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah I've got a--I got a wonderful wife.  I have to do this without breaking up.  'Cause if it wasn't for her I wouldn't even be here.  She's as brilliant as she is beautiful.  I'm just a lucky chump.  I mean, I don't know why (laughter) she ever decided to put faith in me, I'm just glad she did.  I love her dearly and that's putting it lightly.  We are partners and it's been and will continue to be a relationship in which we both learn from each other, sometime begrudgingly, often not at even--not even admitting it to each other, but the great part about the journey that we've had is that we've learned so much from each other.  And out of that was a love that we could pass on to our son.  You know, we disagreed on a lot of things, 'cause we grew up so differently.  But we got real clear real fast about what we pass on to him, what we wanna see him become, how he gets there.  And he's been great.  I'm real proud of him.  I, you know, I couldn't ask for anything more with Jason [Jason Smikle].  He's creative.  He's respectful.  He reminds--he reminds me not of me, but he reminds me of my father [Kenneth Smikle] when I look at him.  Because he does those things that I used to see my father do and when I see him do it, he doesn't know it, but the reason he does it is because it came through his grandfather, who he never got to know.  So I'm just, I'm blessed, you know.  God's given me more chances then I deserve.  Let's hope that whatever chance I'm on, that I make the most of this 'cause (laughter) this could be the last chance to get it right.  But I'm happy that things have turned out as well as they have so far.
Speaker 1: That's about as eloquent as I've ever heard.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: The pleasure's mine Larry [Larry Crowe], thank you (shakes hands).
Speaker 1: All right. Really, that's the best I've ever--
Story_ID: 588293
Speaker 1: That's my mom [Mary Dobbins Smikle] and dad [Kenneth Smikle] taken just a few days after Jason [Jason Smikle] was born back in January 1986.  And we're in our house in New Rochelle, New York.  And the photo is by [HistoryMaker] Dawoud Bey.
Speaker 2: My bald spot's started.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm trying to remember when this was.  We've had, I mean Jason's about oh it's seven there, so yeah, that was--that's about thirteen years ago.  Do you want the story behind this shot?
Speaker 1: If there's one.
Speaker 2: Renee [HistoryMaker Renee Ferguson] went to take new publicity photo for herself and we, we went to pick her up and the photographer told us, hey, hey, jump in, jump in, go on the side and Linda Schwarz is her name, and she just--and she took a couple of shots and it has been for the longest time one of our favorite photographs of us as a family.  So that's from about thirteen years ago, which we--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Let's see, I--this shot--that's from about 1979.
Speaker 1: I was gonna say '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1979, I think just before I did the--around the time I did the--went to the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News].  Kwame Brathwaite who is a well known photographer in New York [New York] took that shot.  And I think we--he--we were trying to get a PR [public relations] shot around the time that I was going to the Amsterdam News but I thought, ah maybe we shouldn't do this picture (laughter) after I saw it.  I said that guy needs to get a haircut and look a little less radical.
Speaker 1: Were your people ever in the UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association] back--way back when?  Your grandmother [Pearl Smikle Simington]?
Speaker 2: What is there to say, where's that guy now (laughter).  And that's a baby picture.  I can--I can't be more than about what a year and a half, maybe two, if that.  I think it's younger than that.  I don't have much history about this, it's just one of those, I think studio shots and I think it was done at one of the department stores where you get a package deal.
Speaker 1: You look you're about four months old there, three or four months old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you're right.  It's less than a year, what am I thinking.  Yeah, yeah, about 1952.
Speaker 1: That's pre-walking (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) January yeah, have to be.
Speaker 1: That's pre-walking days, I can see those legs, they're not toned up yet (laughter).
