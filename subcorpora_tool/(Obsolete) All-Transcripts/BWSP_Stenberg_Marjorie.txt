JH: Okay, so why don't we start with your college years, and
the reasons for your attending Brown, and a little bit of your
family history, and then just go into that.
MS: All right. My mother and father came from western
Pennsylvania and Ohio and my father was born in 1898 and
my mother in 1903. And my father attended Bethany college
in West Virginia, small church school founded by, I think it's
the Cycles of Christ, is the religious background of the school.
And my mother never attended college as a young person, but
did after she moved to Rhode Island. They moved to Rhode
Island in 1964, to retire here. And when she did she entered a
program at the University of Rhode Island and she graduated
with a degree in English and Psychology at the age of 71.
JH: That is so great.
MS: She graduated actually the same year that I graduated
from Nursing School, and there was a picture of us in the paper
with , you know, "Mother and Daughter Graduate." Somebody
once said to me, that was a funny line they said, "Well that
really, that is really a slow learner, you know, graduating at
71." But anyway... my family lived in Mount Lebanon,
Pennsylvania, which is a suburban community for Pittsburgh,
because my father had a business, he was a certified public
accountant, and he commuted into Pittsburgh every day. And
we lived in this very restricted, very, sort of waspy town,
which was a bedroom, basicaIJy a bedroom community for
Pittsburgh.
In 1948, my father assumed the treasurer's
position with Colombian Carving in New York City, and we

moved to suburban New York, and that was in 1948, and I met
for the first time in my life, people of other religious
backgrounds, other ethnic backgrounds. I had never before
met a Jewish person, to the best of my knowledge. I had never
met any Italians; I did not know what pizza was. I could have
lived an extremely deprived childhood had not my family left
this very restricted environment. So we lived in Westchester,
right up next to the Connecticuit border, my father commuted
into New York City every day, and I graduated from Port
Chester High School in 1950 at the age of 16. I was barely 16
years old when I graduated. My family was-- I had wanted to
go to Pembroke, and my family was opposed to it because I
was so young. One of the reasons I wanted to go was that a
young man from town who was not, you know, a dating type of
friend or anything, but a very good friend of mine, from high
school days, a little older, was a student at Brown at the time.
He had talked a lot about Brown and I had the catalogues, and I
just knew that this was the place I wanted to go. I really
wanted a coordinated education. I wanted to go to a women's
college, in the university setting, that you had all the
educational advantages of a university but you had this little
separate, "separate but equal," I thought, place for women, and
this was what I wanted. My family was opposed to me coming
because they thought that Providence was a big city with lots
of problems, that this was a big university, that I would get lost
and swallowed up in it, and they wanted me to go to Bethany
College where my father was a trustee, and so I did. My
freshman year, I went down to Bethany, kicking and screaming
all the way. Bethany's in West Virginia, it's just south and west
of Pittsburgh, and it's a region, it's a college where a lot of
regional people go, those small schools, Janine, are in Bethany,
and Miami of Ohio, schools like that, are in that they're mostly
church related schools that they were way back, it was way
back in the country there's nothing there but the little school,
nobody has a car, there's no place to go and nothing to do
unless you a can date a ministerial student. Now, the ministers
of these churches you know, no drinking, no smoking, no
dancing or anything, were the wildest people on campus. I

mean, what you did was to get in with one of them so that you
could get off of campus occasionally, because they were
allowed to have cars ...
JH: Uh-huh ...
MS: ... they had cars because they preached at these little
churches out in the community. And I do remember being
impressed with West Virginia even at that tender age at the
grinding and unbelievable poverty that I saw. And I began to
be affected by that, even in those short excursions to places
like Stubenville, and Wellsburg, and places like that. I think I
had been there 3 months when I re-applied to Pembroke. I,
first of all, I have to tell you I came to, the summer before I
went away to college, I came up to Pembroke early in the
summer, and I had an interview with Dean Moore, I believe,
and she was very encouraging and I was accepted. I had been
told by the person who did the college counseling in my high
school not to apply to Pembroke because I wouldn't get in.
JH: Oh, really?
MS: Yes. I was told that because the salutatorian of our class
had not gotten in. She was an Italian girl, brilliant, and there
was absolutely no reason for her not to get accepted except
that she probably would have needed a lot of money to go to
school. She eventually went to Barnard, and worked, lived at
home and went to Barnard. She was brilliant. And because she
hadn't gotten in, this woman assumed that Brown only took the
very best and that she hadn't been good enough. My grades,
while they were very good, were not as good as this girl's, so I
wouldn't get in. What they weren't counting on was the ethnic
and family background type of thing that influenced
admissions to Brown and Pembroke at that time, probably still
does, but it did very definitely. I got in here, not only got in
here but she said to me, "Look," --she interviewed me alone,
and she said, "I understand your problem. I know how parents
feel about a place like this. It's not any safer or any unsafer

than that place that you're going to. But she said, "Go and gIVe
it a try. You're very young," she said, "It will delay you a year,
but still, if you still want us, re-apply." And that's exactly what
I did, and I got accepted again. And I was the object of a good
deal of interest from the transfer and other students that came
in with me at the same time because I had the rare experience
of being accepted twice--refusing Brown and then getting
accepted again, which was very unusual. We were told when
we came here how lucky we were, that there were only so
many places for women at this school and that if we were
unhappy here to tell them immediately because there were 6
or 7 people at the gate waiting to get in.
JH: Right...
MS: .. .literally, waiting to get in.
get into Pembroke ...
JH:

It was much more difficult to

That's what I heard.

MS: ... than it was to get into Brown, much more difficult. We
were better students, we performed better in the classroom,
we did better almost everything, and the pool of people
applying was so much better than the pool of people applying
to Brown at the time, there was just no comparison.
JH: How did your parents feel at the second try at Pembroke?
Were they encouraging? Of. ..
MS: Yes, I told them I had given it a good, the "cold college
try," I had done well in my classes, I had joined a sorority just
to try to get into the sort of life that the college offered. But I
did tell them that they needn't have worried about Pembroke
because I said, "It's very difficult to stay in there," and I said
"There's somebody behind every tree at Bethany." I mean,
you'd think that nothing's going on but...I said, "They're all
married the instant that they graduate, they're .. .it's just no
different from any place else as far as being able to protect you

from sex or whatever else or liquor or whatever else it is. I
said, "I used to go out with all these guys who had churches in
the communities and we would get bombed on Saturday
afternoon," so I mean, you know, it wasn't really all that great.
So I did corne to Brown, I carne as a transfer. It's a very
difficult thing to do because you end up having two freshman
years. You end up having two years adjusting to the you know,
the, being away from horne, the changes in academics, and
basically the change in academics was pretty radical. I did well
at Bethany without much effort. I couldn't do well without
much effort here. The first semester that I was here I
promptly got mononucleosis, I was very, very ill, very sick. I
was in the infirmary with a white count of 35,000. I do
remember that it did impress them, at the infirmary, so I count
that high when the normal is about 5,000. And I did very
poorly in my grades mid-semester, and went horne feeling
very defeated, carne back managed to get myself a little better
round. Then my junior and senior year were much better. I
did, I think resent, down the line somewhere, that I had had to
spend that year at Bethany. Ultimately looking back on it from
this great a vantage point I can understand why my parents
did it, being a parent now, but I wouldn't..1 should have really
put my foot down. I was being a very dutiful daughter, and I
don't think I would do that today, nor would I expect a
daughter of mine, if I had one, to do what I had to. They would
have much more choice, the choosing of the ... But I did
specifically corne to Pembroke for what it had, or what it was,
and what it had, and I was not disappointed in that aspect of it.
There were no differences in family about going to college
because of gender other than this business of, my brother was
older when he carne to go to college. There was no... by that
time I was at Brown. My brother went to Princeton. He liked
Princeton fine, but he carne to Brown almost every weekend he
could get away.
JH: Really?

MS: He set up his schedule so, yes, after his freshman year he
set up his schedule so that he was here very often we would go
to the fraternity and we would find him. He used to go to Carl's
fraternity and he would be up here. And so he used to come
up to Brown occasionally. Also he was later stationed in the
navy in Newport and he used to also come back to Brown, but
he did spend some weekends up here. But I don't think, no ...
my father divided everything between us as far as estate was
concerned, he was interested in us having an education. I
think he was much more interested in protecting me because I
was so young. That was basically the reason. I don't really feel
that there was any other expectation but that I would go to
college, even if I wanted to marry they wanted me to go to
college.
JH:

What stands out in your mind about the school here?

MS:

You mean, about the ...

JH: Anything-- academics, friends, counselors. Did you really
feel encouraged as a woman to go into new areas? I'm just
wondering you know, it being a women's college at the time.
MS: Well, Dean Lois was a very unusual woman, and she was a
very fine role model. She was a very dignified lady, and very
interested in the students. She actually did know a great many
of us and she also came with my class. We always had
considered her-- she was an honorary member of our class
when we graduated-- and we always sort of considered her as
you know a part of us, a part of our class. To this day-- I mean
when I was smoking, I'm not anymore-- but to this day I could
not light a cigarette on a street. You just didn't do that. I
remember being extremely distressed by all of the rules that
we had. We were not allowed to wear slacks, and I spent most
of my college courses in laboratories where it would have been
much more comfortable to have been able to wear pants and
jeans and things like that. That bothered me. I also think that
there were no role models, not many role models around here.

Posy Porell was here at the time I was here but she was, she
was an academic at that point, she was not the dean, and I
think that there very, very few women role models, very few
women professors. Betsy Rudd was made a full professor, I
think later than when we were here. But she was a phys. ed
person, and the academics, you were really not, not that
stimulated. I wouldn't say that we were terribly discriminated
against, but I don't think ... I'm trying to remember a lot of
opinion courses where we talked, well, in the English
Department you were expected to talk and contribute like
everybody else, and I took a lot of English courses. In Bio
courses it was mostly didactic and we sat and listened to
lectures, did the laboratories and things like that. I know that
when people in the laboratories wanted someone to work for
them that they usually went to the women. And I'll talk about
that in a little bit because I did go to work in the biology
department after I graduated. The one person who stands out
in my mind as somebody encouraging in my field was Charles
Arthur Stuart, who was a professor of microbiology. Charlie
Stuart was very tied up with this community because he taught
nursing students. We had a nursing program.
JH: Right.
MS: And the nursing program took three years at Pembroke/at
Brown courses, and then they added a community health
course and then they went two years to Rhode Island Hospital
School of Nursing, so it was a 5 year program. It was one of
those things that penalized women in a women's profession
again, because other people could have a professional degree 10
four years, but nurses, tending to be a large women's
profession, seemed to be punishing themselves and putting an
extra 5 year of courses-- there were 5 year courses, even 6
year courses. So that your degree, you didn't come and do
graduate work, you didn't get your degree and then do
graduate work, which occurs in a couple of places now, but you
took a 5 year program. As a result there were very, very few
women in that program. That program graduated you with a

class that you didn't know, because you came back and
graduated with the class beyond yours, the next year of yours.
But anyway, to get back to Dr. Stuart, I remember as a senior
when I was graduating, Charlie Stuart used to make his own
media to grow his bugs, and I was walking across the hallway
in Arnold Lab and Charlie Stuart came up and said, and he was
elderly at the time, and he said, "Now you're graduating this
June, aren't you," and I said, "Yes I am." He said, "Well, what
are you going to do?" I said, "Well, I'm getting married and I'm
going to live at Mount Hermon, Massachusetts, at a boys
school." And he says, "No, no, no, no, not with your life, what
are you going to do with your mind?" Charlie Stuart was the
only person who asked me that. He wanted me to go to
graduate school. That was the only real person. I can
remember Dean talks giving us little lectures on going with our
husbands to various places, and how to adapt to that kind of
stuff. There was no radical rhetoric about what women should
do for themselves. There was very little to do about preparing
women for jobs. The job office here was very bad, the
placement office at Pembroke was, I think, not good, it was not
seeking out things. It was not it's time. In that time, it was
probably be considered doing what it was important to do but
when I came back a few years later and went into that
placement office to try to get help there was no real, there was
no real support for women's careers. For jobs, maybe, but
certainly not for careers, or for professional education or
anything like that.
JH: So the thought still at the time was that you would get
married and follow your husband and raise a family?
MS: I had always, until I met my husband in my junior year, I
had never thought of doing, that I was going to get a degree
from Brown and go to Women's Medical in Pennsylvania. I was
going to be a doctor. And that's what I had always wanted.
Today, if I were in the same situation, I would have married
him anyway, but he would have gone up to do his thing and I
would have gone to do my thing. But people just didn't do that

in those days, weren't encouraged to do it, there were really no
mechanisms to do it. There as a kind of a closed attitude
toward women and what their position and their role was
meant to be. So I didn't do that. Other things that influenced
me at Pembroke, I think we had a lot of fun in the dorms, we
had a lot of good times in dorm life. I lived with a crazy group
of people, seniors, class before me, class of '53 people, and
seniors from my own group in East Andrews the last two years,
with my roommate Joan Long, Joan Hurst Long, also class of '54.
And we had a lot of fun. One of the outstanding times was the
time we put the piano on the elevator and rode and it up and
down. Well, it was gracious living. Did the other people you've
interviewed tell you about gracious living?
JH:
MS:
dear,
night
heels

No, they didn't.
They didn't mention gracious living? Oh my goodness, my
you must know about gracious living. Every Wednesday
we had to dress for dinner. Dressing for dinner meant
and stockings ...

JH: Oh wow...
MS: ... well ,what we usually did was, I have seen people with
skirts on over their gym uniforms and heels on, in the dining
room, not necessarily quite interesting, but Wednesday night,
and then we had coffee in the lounges afterwards and usually
with the dean. The dean came over to eat with us, and
sometimes you had to sit at the dean's table. And then Sunday
dinner was the same thing. Sunday noontime was also a dress
meal. And those were little concessions to gracious living. It
was not our favorite thing to do. In fact most of us had a pair
of heels exclusively to wear Saturday night and to gracious
living dinners on Wednesday nights, and Sundays... I took
physical education all the way through. We were aHowed to
get out of it in our senior year. But I felt so uncomfortable and
so miserable and logy and had such lousy cramps which I had

never had before in my life and so did my roommate.
synchronized our periods, you know ...
JH:

We

Right...

MS: ...you know the way people do when they--nobody knew
anything about that, but Joan and I knew years before because
it had been happening to us but nobody had ever articulated it.
But we used to go out and play tennis the first day so that we
could get all of that over with and have it done with so that we
wouldn't have cramps or be uncomfortable. And all you have
to do is exercise, really. So what we did, what I did, and I
think Joan did too, is we went back and I took gym for my
senior year, in fact, I helped her teach swimming. And I had
the wonderful experience of teaching a very tall and very
heavy girl who was from the Midwest and had never seen a
body of water larger than the bathtub, to swim. Because one of
the very terrible things about Brown was that you could not
get your degree unless you knew how to swim.
JH:

I heard, yeah ...

MS: There were actually people who did not get their degrees.
You know when you think about somebody's civil rights, and
you think about what they've paid for and you think about
what they did, I later taught in nursing schools, and I have
never in my life seen anything like the control that people
have over students in nursing schools. They don't have that
anymore, but Brown had almost that kind of control over the
students here. And you did get told about the posture
pictures?
JH:

I don't think ...

MS: You don't know that they photographed all of us
nude?
JH: Oh really?

In

the

MS: Yes, they photographed shadow photos of us, to see, you
know, which hip was higher, which was lower, and then they
were supposed to-- this was in the gym program-- and they
were supposed to develop your skills and also if you had any
striking difficulties with your body, that they would suggest
the kinds of exercise and things like that that you might want
to take. These posture pictures, I want to tell you, were a
source of great concern as to what was going to happen to those
things or if people could break into the gym and steal the
posture pictures. It was regularly threatened that they were
actually out on the campus with our names on them... True, it's
true. I mean, can you imagine? And there was none of us who
said, or words to that effect, "You're not going to take my
picture," you know? We just didn't do those things.
JH: That's one phrase that keeps coming up over and over with
the women I interview, "We just didn't do that," "It just wasn't
done," or "We just didn't do those things."
MS:

That's right, that's right.

JH: So what were the relations between men and women like
at the time? In the classroom and socially?
MS: In the classroom it was pretty much, well, it depended on
the classes I think. In the sciences where I spent most of my
last two years, in biology, we were just all working so hard,
that it was really difficult to notice any terrible difference
between us. I didn't notice any discrimination or anything of
that nature. There was, most of the lectures, there was so
much material to get in that it was primarily didactic, and for
instance a lot of people who were not biology majors who were
still going on to medical school were loaded into our sophomore
and junior courses, like in compo anatomy and the basic
chemistries, and stuff like that, so the classes got smaller as we
got to our junior and senior year and you got to the actually
concentration in biology. We got smaller classes. But it was

still just, there really wasn't the place for opinions and that
kind of stuff where you could get into philosophy where people
sit and argue. Do women actually sit and argue in a classroom
full of men? I don't know. I took many courses in English,
where again, though, so much of it was didactic. It wasn't until
the New Curriculum came in, until the, beyond the distribution
courses where you got into smaller courses where people
expressed opinions and talked very much in class. It was
pretty much lecture too, in most of the courses that I took.
Except in Elmer Bustein's poetry course where I met my
husband, and where to this day, Elmer claims he will go to his
grave before he tells us which one of us got the A+ in the
course. One of us got an A and one of us got an A+ and he's not
saying which one it was, which I think is a sort of a sexist
thing, anyhow. I think that because he's not saying that it was
me. [JH & MS laugh] Anyway, and I wasn't even an English
major. So it really rocked my husband's socks. Anyway, in
that course where we all talked and discussed and all that sort
of stuff, I was a very outgoing person anyway, so I didn't have
any trouble opening my mouth in any class. I don't know
whether women who are more inhibited had more trouble. I
just know that, I've been teaching a long time since then, and I
just know that I try to involve my students a lot more even in
didactic courses, even when I've been teaching anatomy and
physiology and things like that. I have really tried to involve
students in talking and asking what they don't know and
questioning and things like that.
JH: I mean I can see the difference right now with certain
professors who really do try, you know even in class these kind
of people, will try to encourage interaction between student
and teacher during the lectures. You know, I have a professor,
who teaches a Compo Lit. course and he's very much like that,
you know makes a point of trying to explain to students what
he means, and things like that.
MS:
D 1.

One of the most outstanding courses at Brown was History
We had distribution courses and the distribution courses

were where you had to take four courses in the humanities,
four courses in social sciences, and four courses in the hard
sciences. And I had had a lot of that at Bethany. I had
anatomy, I mean, I had freshman bio and I had chemistries
and I had a lot of Spanish, I was going to be a Spanish major
when I was down there, I had had a lot of Spanish in high
school, so I had a lot of that. I took English, I passed on my
college boards the scores were high enough that we didn't have
to take freshman English, either here or down at Bethany I
didn't have to take it. So I took what was commonly the
sophomore course-- From Beowulf to Virginia Woolf in 2 easy
semesters-- you know, I took that one down at Bethany, and
then was ready for more advanced courses up here. And while
I wanted to major in Bio because it was challenging and I
enjoyed it-- I had a marvellous high school biology teacher, a
young man. I had it my senior year too. For some reason or
other I didn't have it earlier-- who was getting his Ph.D. at
Columbia or something, and he taught our bio courses. He came
in in the middle of the year, relieved a dreadful teacher, who
could not have inspired anybody to do anything, and he was
just a dynamo, and he turned me onto biology, and I've never
been turned off since. And so that's one of the reasons, and
then I got down to Bethany, and I was able to take biology with
Bernard Wymer (????) who was a world famous, he wrote a
very fine textbook, and was a world famous biology teacher.
And then I came up to Brown, and it's interesting because Bill
Montana who was also a world's leading authority on skin, and
was at Brown for many, many years, taught the anatomy and
physiology course, one of the best courses in the whole of the
Brown curriculum, whether or not you were a bio major. He
was, as a student, had been to Bethany, he was a Bethany
graduate, and had illustrated Bernard Wymer's book.
JH: Oh, wow ...
MS: He was an artist too. He was a fine medical illustrator. So
I knew him, and our families knew each other, they were both

from Uniontown, the families were both from the same area, so
I sort of gravitated to the biology department here too.
JH: Okay, I think I'm going to have to turn the tape over at this
point.
End Tape 1, Side 1

Tape 1, Side 2
JH: Okay, this is side 2.
MS: I started to tell you about the course that Dr. George
taught. And it was History Dl. And the immediate world took
it, and they had it in the auditorium over here in Alumni.
JH:

Uh-huh.

MS: And it was full. There were generally, I don't know how
many it holds, 3 or 4 hundred people, in that hall for every, for
Brown and Pembroke students. Even up in the balcony. And
he was a superb lecturer. He had organized the history of the
world in such a way, in major topics, in major areas-- it was a
brilliant lecture. He was so good at it. He was humorous, he
was, he used no media, he used nothing but himself, his body,
his voice, his content. And you wrote like the fury. If you
dropped your pencil you didn't even know that you'd missed
two revolutions, you know, a war, whatever, you couldn't lose
it if you just lost your pen under the chair in the row in front
of you. Brilliant. Those lectures were applauded every day,
just as though you had been to an evening lecture to listen to
somebody discuss something. And at the end of the semester,
it was common for his last lecture, it was very important, and it
was common for people to come from all over the campus just
to visit the last lecture of the year. The guy usually got a
standing ovation. He was absolutely a superb, superb lecturer.
In order to be able to talk we had section meetings for most of

the courses that met in those large groups like that. And the
section meetings were generally taught by graduate students.
And so you could discuss and talk, also Dr. George did take a
couple of sections of his own. He was a senior person in the
history department, absolutely superb.
And I still remember
those, I still have the notes from those classes somewhere, I
feel quite sure. The other courses that I had that really
impressed me, and a course that I used all of my life was Art
DI. That was the history, like "Beowulf to Virginia Woolf," only
it was from the fertility symbols to Jasper John, in one
semester. And that was, I was lucky, being a science major you
were able to take those distribution courses out of your area at
strange times of your life. And I was able to take Art DI as a
second semester senior. And as you know, your life in college
comes together in your senior year. You are just marching
down the hill to get your degree, when it suddenly dawns on
you what the whole thing is about, and that all of the courses
that you have taken, all of the work that you've done is
The Biology has something to say to English Lit,
interrelated.
but English Lit. has an immense amount to say to Biology, and
that History says words to all of it. But you never put it
together until it's too late. I mean, people are actually clinging
to the gates, saying, "It's too soon, I'm not ready to go!" And
you suddenly have discovered what life is all about. This
means when you are lucky enough to have discovered this as
you march down the hill, or maybe the semester before you
march down the hill, is usually when you begin planning your
graduate work, so you are not happy outside the academic
setting. The other thing is that you will find when you get out
of school that your biorhythms are all set to gear up to start in
September. The year does not start January first. The year for
the rest of your life begins in September and it goes until May,
and what's left over of the year, it's just something to get
through until September comes again.
So anyway, that was
pretty much my college experience. I think it was good. I
think overall I had a good experience. Overall I was happy
with the Pembroke experience. I was never really happy with
the dating scene very much. I enjoyed it, I had a good time. I

don't think you could be really friends with people and go out
with them and have a good time. It was just all so focused on,
you know, being a couple, and all that that entailed.
JH:

Were there sororities and such on campus at the time?

MS: No ... no ... no sorontIes. They had been, you'll have to look
up in the histories, but I don't actually remember when ...
JH: Because there were these houses that I noticed in the
yearbook, I think. I think they had Angell House...
MS: Yeah ...
JH: ... King House.
campus living?

What were those?

Were those, was there off

MS: Yeah. Angell House, well I'm not, I'm not, really good we
can look them up ... Angell House was, they were not really
specific with one exception and I don't remember which one
that was. The freshmen did not live in the main dormitories.
The freshmen lived in these houses scattered around. They
lived in small pods, small units. There may have been 35-40
girls in those freshmen dorms. And those freshmen dorms, this
is why this question is asked about freshmen year. This
freshmen year was a very different experience for most people
because it did take place in those little pods. It sort of got your
friends together. People tended to sort of float through school
with those people that they had lived with in their freshman
dorms, so I have sort of special feelings about those people that
they lived with in the freshmen dorms. Now one of those
houses, and I'm not, I just don't remember off-hand which one
it was, it was right up here on the corner, off Meeting and
Brown, was the commuter house.
JH:

Right, West House.

MS: Yes, West House, and many of the people who lived away
from Brown and many of the city students did not really have
the same experience at Brown as the rest of us had.
JH:

That's right... [voice trails off]

MS: And one of the things I want to tell whoever will listen is
that when they prepared class of '54 materials that they
prepared for one of our graduations, our last reunion, I guess
our 30th reunion ... the material that was provided for that and
the overvoice and the people who narrated that, the people
who wrote it, were city people. And our, my experience as a
dorm student, and ... it was completely different. I hardly
recognized that.. [motorcycle drowns out voice] I really have a
lot of trouble in labelling that class of '54, because it was so
different, there was only one person who lived in the
dormitories in the group who put that together. And their
experience was very different. Many of the city students
simply didn't have the money to live there, also there was not
the dorm space. The year that I came, we were really crowded.
I think that in some of the freshmen dorms they were triples,
they had three beds in a room. In some of the upperclass
dorms they did too because more people accepted Pembroke
than ever had before. They always accept a few more than
they can actually accommodate. So that was a problem that
year. But I did not have that experience coming here as a
transfer, so I really can't speak to that freshman unit. Some
people do have really fond memories of that freshman unit.
But that's what all those houses were. No, there were no
sororities. There had been previously and they had gotten rid
of them. I think that they probably got very snotty and very
discriminatory on a campus that was just stirring, just stirring
the aspects of getting rid of some of that; it was just stirring on
campus. On the Brown campus the fraternities were still there .
The fraternities were the major aspect of campus life, campus
social life. Those people who didn't belong to fraternities were
really sort of out of it as far as dating is concerned. And it's
interested me a great deal that as I come back to reunions, and

since we live here I am able to come back to almost all the
reunions, the people who have meant the most to me, the
people with whom I've connected and had really good, shared
experiences on the reunion weekends, were people that I never
would have sought out to know in college. They were not the
big men on campus; they were not the football players; they
were not the people that you normally would think of as
companions. These were the sort of, well they might have been
considered the studious types, the nerds. They are doing
fascinating things, like one of them's a lawyer in New York for
all the big entertainment people. I mean, you can sit and listen
to him weave stories all day and all night. Some of them have
done fascinating things in travel, in the sciences, all kinds of
exciting people have come up as alumni to me, not as
undergraduates.
I knew some pretty interesting
undergraduates because I had very eclectic taste in people.
And my roommate was fond of saying that our room was a
haven for those in need of psychological support, of making
over into, you know, somebody who could go out in public,
things like that. But overall I thought it was a very good
expenence.
JH:

So what do you remember about Commencement?

MS: I remember the immensely impressive commencement. I
also my family being immensely impressed because they had,
... later on, they were telling me that they went to my brother's
Princeton graduation and they were expecting something like
Brown and they never got it. We were small enough then and
we had this very complex and complicated way of graduating.
You went over there ... it was an army that was marching, and
there was a person whose sole responsibility in the university
was to run graduation, and he started in September, believe
me, he or she, I'm sure it was a he in those days. They started
in September. And we went over there and lined up early. We
went down the hill, reversed ourselves, went into the meeting
house, and our families could go in there too because we were
small, reversed ourselves coming back up the house, up the

hill, came back to the campus, the graduates had graduated and
they joined us on the campus just the way they do now. Then
we each were able to go up and get our diplomas. And believe
it or not, after all that switching around and all that chaos and
all that craziness, we a]) got the right diplomas. They almost
never made a mistake. They prided themselves on knowing
that they had given you the absolute proper diploma. The
whole weekend was just a fairyland ... I had been to some of it
before as a junior, as a sophomore and a junior dating guys
who were graduating, so that I had seen the fabulous weekend
and all that sort of stuff. There was a very, very impressive
graduation, still is, it still is. I remember the summer that we
went to Europe on the boat that there were a number of Brown
grads on the boat and my husband was in great demand
because he could hum the Brown graduation march, which is of
course never played any other time except fot graduation. And
he remembered it. And he could hum it. [JH laughs] And so
they used to invite us to parties and buy him drinks so that he
would hum it. [JH laughs] Brown graduation, yes it was very
.

JH:

So you got married right after graduation ...

MS: Yes I got married in August of '54, right after my
graduation. I had just turned twenty one. I was the second
youngest in my class, so I had not turned 21 when I graduated.
JH: How did you end up entering or finishing high school at
such a young age? Did you go through an accelerated program?
MS: Yes. No, I went through a mid-year, do you know they
used to have mid-year graduations in high schools, and mid­
year classes in grade schools many, many years ago, when they
were crowded. And they had .. .in the fifth grade is where it
happened. In the fifth grade, they wanted us a1l to go together
but the group that was going to be graduating in June and the
group that was going to, I mean, the group that was finishing
the fifth grade in the middle of the year and the group that

was finishing the fifth grade-- they put us all together and
they accelerated us through that. And we had the choice, if
you were real young, of staying back and repeating the fourth
grade again and then going into the fifth grade. I stamped my
feet in the hall, and then screamed, and said I was not going to,
I was already bored in school. I was reading in kindergarten,
and I was very bored by what they were teaching me. I was
totally unteachable in math but the rest of it I was totally
bored with. So I said, "If you keep me back I will never go
back to school again." So they, my mother capitulated and
that's how I graduated. Down the road, it put me out of school
at just 16, which was like 2 to 3 years younger than everybody
else in the class.
JH: So after you married, you moved, you said to
Massachusetts?
MS: We moved to Mount Hermon school where my husband
was a teacher. And he taught English and Biology. He had
been teaching Biology. He was, he was already teaching up
there. He was teaching biology. They needed another Bio
instructor and he used to come down on weekends to visit me
when I was a senior, and I would teach him the biology for the
week. [JH laughs] And then he would ask questions and stuff
like that and the students later told him he was wonderful on
Monday, he was okay on Tuesday, he was fading by
Wednesday, [JH laughs] on Thursday he was really bad, by
Friday they said it's time for you to go to Providence again. But
his students did very well on the department exam and they
learned a lot, and ... but that's how he did it. So he was in his
second year up there, and I married him and we moved ... we
came to Providence actually starting up the east coast on our
honeymoon and were involved, caught in the hurricane of 1954
and in the Biltmore. Everybody brought their brides to the
Biltmore because we couldn't get into the Biltmore before you
were married.
(knock at door.

JH: Yes?

tape stopped, restarted)

MS: They had a very good house detector and you couldn't get
up there at all and so it was kind of a tradition if you were
coming this way that you stayed at the Biltmore on your
wedding night. So we did that, and we got caught as we just
barely made it out of Providence, before the downtown
flooded. I mean the water was 8 feet deep at the side of the
Biltmore and loads of people lost their cars. We went up the
coast to Maine and we got another hurricane, we got the other
end of the hurricane, and we stayed in an old place up there.
Actually, New Hampshire, I'm sorry, the little piece of New
Hampshire that sticks out there. And we went along the beach
the morning after the hurricane looking for, we were evacuated
inland but came back to the place because the family that were
living there had their granddaughter there. So we figured they
would stay unless it was safe. And then we looked for lobsters
that had been abandoned on the shore, but of course there
weren't any. Then we decided the heck with this, we're not
supposed to have a honeymoon, we went over to Mount
Hermon to set up our apartment. We got that all set up, we
decided to go visit friends in Montreal, we got another
hurricane [JH laughs] coming back from Montreal. So it was
just not meant to be. [JH laughs] Anyway, I moved up to
Mount Hermon, I moved out of the dorm at Pembroke, and into
a dorm up there and we lived there for three years. I was only
a year older than the oldest kid up there, the postgraduate
student year many, many students came. And I loved it. We
had a whole dorm fu)] of teenage kids and I like teenagers, I
mean I still do. It's my favorite age of people is young adults,
and I just enjoyed that a great deal. I went to get a job. This
really amused me, this is an amusing woman-story. I went to
get a job and I went into Greenfield, which is the nearest big
city, well it was town, and they had a hospital there.
And I
had been trained in labwork. I had worked as a lab technician
summers when I was in high school, I had worked sometimes,
a few things for Brown people, so I was more or less trained in
hospital labwork. So I went up there and I went for an
interview with the pathologist, Aaron Newton, an excellent and

wonderful man. And Dr. Newton said to me you know, that yes
he might have a place in the laboratory, that they needed
someone to do histology. And I said fine, I don't want to take
call, because I live all the way out in the country, and there's
no use in my coming in here. I mean, by the time I get in here
for an emergency, it's not an emergency anymore, the person's
either better or dead. So I said I don't want to do that, but
what I really would like to do is just do histology and micro
maybe, and that way I wouldn't take call. And he said well,
now that will be fine. He said, by the way, when did you get
married? And I said well I was married August 28th, and this
was like September 30th or whatever. And he said well, I
don't think you ought to come to work right now. I think you
should go home and get adjusted to marriage. [JH laughs]
Could you imagine that somebody could say something like that
to a woman? Can you imagine that a woman wouldn't have
risen up ... I mean I wanted the job so I wasn't going to rise up
and pound the desk and tell him it's none of his business
whether I'm adjusted or not, or whether my husband and I
have been living together for 10 years or not. I just... I just
went back home to get adjusted to marriage. In the meantime,
I had a chance to fill in for one of the teachers at Northfield,
which was the girls' coordinate school for Mount Hermon, and I
taught some, a couple of weeks of biology for somebody who
had to be out for a couple of weeks and that was kind of fun.
Then in the first of the year I went back to the hospital and I
said look boys, let's just stop this nonsense, I need a job. And
they hired me to do what I had wanted to do. And so I had a
very good experience there. We were at Mount Hermon for 2
years, 2 more years until 1957 when my husband got a rotary
fellowship to study abroad and we went to Ireland to live. We
went to Northern Island, we went over on the boat, an
overhauling American. We took an enormous three body
Hitchcock original truck with us, because we were taking all of
our worldly possessions, practically. We sold all our furniture
and everything we left at Mount Hermon and this was one of
just many moves in the next few years. And anyway we went
to Northern Ireland. Very few people, very few American

students had been in Northern Ireland. Most of them wanted
to go to Oxford, London, Cambridge, Edinburgh or Trinity in
Dublin, but we had a list of the Marshall scholarships and those
were put together by England. And so consequently they
didn't include Trinity, and we forgot about Trinity and put
down as our third choice Queens University, Northern Ireland,
and nobody had ever been there, so that's the one they gave
us. If you got the fellowship and they gave them out. It was
very good, it was a very interesting year. We spent a year
over there travelling extensively. We travelled 3000 miles in
Ireland, which is a very small country, but back and forth to all
the rotary clubs, we spoke to all the rotary clubs. We went to
all the major businesses, because rotary is basically a business
organization. We went to all of their businesses and talked to
their groups and met almost, knew by name, a high percentage
of all the rotarians in Ireland. They all came to a big dinner for
us at the end before we were leaving. It was really wonderful,
a wonderful year. I took the English Honors lectures, which my
husband did also. He worked on a thesis on the Gothic novel,
and I took the Irish language from a young... the Irish speaking
people in Northern Ireland wear a circle pin. And the young
man who taught my Irish classes at the University taught me
such wonderful phrases as "we will blow up the bridge," "bring
the galignite," you know [JH & MS laugh] things that you're
certainly going to have a lot of use for in polite conversation if
you ever meet anybody else who speaks Irish, which is not
likely that you are going to meet anybody else who speaks
Irish. But at any rate, I also took Irish History with J. C.
Beckett, who is one of the world's leading authorities on Irish
history, and that was a very, very fine experience. I wrote the
papers, I did the tutorials, I, you know, did the whole bit... used
the very old library. It was a lot of fun. It was a very, very
good year. And we enjoyed that. Then we travelled, we
travelled extensively in England during spring vacation, and
then we rented a car in Paris, and drove 3000 miles in Europe.
We did the whole thing on 1500 dollars. Of course we slept in
places where the sheets hadn't been changed either, but when
you're young it doesn't matter if you do that. And we travelled

all those miles. We met some rotarians from Ireland in Lugano,
when you think it's a small world, you know, but it was a
wonderful, wonderful year. It was a great thing to be able to
do before you have a family and before you can't do those
kinds of things.
JH: That's right...
MS: Then we came back to, at the end of that year, we came
back to Providence, where Carl entered, my husband entered,
Brown University graduate school. And we've been here ever
since, we never left, after that.
JH:

Okay, so, let's get into the merger.

MS: Okay ...
JH: Do you want to get into that now or would you rather do
the ...
MS: Well, the merger was .. .it happened in, it finished I guess in
what, 1972, right, was the finish of the merger, and I just had
jotted down a few things (rumbles through papers) here
about that. I'm trying to remember. There was a committee
first of all... I know I wrote it down in here, just hold on a
second ... I was on the board of the Pembroke Alumna magazine
when I got back into town. I started, I got onto the board of
the magazine and then I also began writing some of these
articles that brought... what are the dates, let me just check the
dates on one of these because I'm trying to remember how
early, this was an early one, was it, '61. We came back in
fifty ... let's see, we were in Ireland in '56-'57, and we came, we
were here in Rhode Island, 1957. In 1957 I went to work In
the Brown biology department.
That's kind of important
because I was going to go to nursing school, there was no
medical school here at Brown, and I was stuck in Rhode Island,
and I didn't want to commute to Boston. So what I thought I
would do would be to go to the nursing school. Why not--I had

everything except that one course and I could just pick that up
and go in. At a graduate student meeting, I met Mackeds, who
was the embryology, my embryology professor at Brown in the
biology department. And he wanted me to come to work for
him. He said I am starting a whole new research, I am going to
be a biochemist. He was a classic, descriptive embryologist
before that. I need somebody to work in the laboratory. And I
said I'm going to go to nursing school. And he said you don't
want to do that, you want to come to work for me. I said well,
come, I'll come and talk to you. And the more I thought about
it the more I thought, well Carl's only making like 3000 dollars
a year and we have to live so maybe it would be a good idea to
take a job and I can go back and get that nursing thing later.
Well I went to work for him in 1957, and we were doing, we
were doing studies on macromolecular aggregates. In other
words we used collagen as a model, how the body lays down
macromolecular structures and we were using frog embryos,
and I stripped off the basal lanallae of 1,968 basal lanallae you
know, stage 18 embryos, little tiny buggers. Anyway, I did
that until 1959 when I left. My first child was born in October
of '59, Christopher was born then. And I came back briefly to
write a paper with him. Carl took one summer, the next
summer in 1960, the summer of 1960, we wrote a paper
together so that I came back. Carl just took the baby for a
couple of weeks. I also did some more work for him a little bit
later. Then in 1961 Kurt was born, my younger son was born.
So I had the the two children sort of in the middle there. And
after the children were born I began getting active in
community based programs. And the first thing I got active in
was, I was appointed to the board, I took a painting class with
Dr, with Cummings, I think, here, and I also was asked to be on
the board of the Pembroke Alumna. And I began to write
articles on like, on the libraries, on the background, and the
things that I showed you, I began to do those. But I also
became, we both of us got active in our church, which is St.
Martin's Episcopal down on the East side. We were living on
the East side in a basement apartment down near Wayland
Square. Then we moved up to Morris Avenue, which is also

still on the East side. I started out being active
committees for the class and that kind of thing.

the reUnIon

[tape stopped, restarted]
MS: Let's see, also we did some work for the Mount Hermon
group. In 1963 I did the usual stuff. The war began, the
Vietnam War. They started sending troops over there, in '64
and '65. But I had been active and one of the founders of the
Rhode Island Chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality in 19, I
think 63, end of '63, beginning of '64 I think, was when we
founded that. And it was a small group, mostly women, some
black men, black and white women, and black and white men,
and we had a, we finally got ourselves a little place to meet
down on Pleasant Street which was just off North Main Street.
And we were involved in, for the first time I became involved
in fair housing issues, and lots of other stuff that was going on
at that time. At the time, the women, the black women, were
talking to us about Vietnam. And we began to notice in '64 and
'65 the numbers of Rhode Islanders killed in Vietnam were
greater than the statistics. The statistics coming back from the
government were that there was one American adviser killed
and there were 1000 Vietnamese bodies on the field. Well, I
think it's very difficult to conceptualize 1000 Vietnamese
bodies lying anywhere in anyone place, and the other thing
was there were three young Rhode Islanders killed, and they're
telling me, and this is a tiny state ...
JH: Right...
MS: At that point we stopped believing in the United States
government, at that point, that early. We began active protest
against the war, both my husband and myself, but particularly
me. And concurrently with working with the Congress of Racial
Equality, e.O .R.E., what we were doing. I became very active 10
the reunion committees. I was in reunion for '62 and then I
think we had another one in '64 ... '65 I guess. I did public
relations for e.O.R.E.. In 1966 I was their treasurer. And I also,

at that point in my life became active in Republican politics.
Sounds like an anachronism doesn't it, that you would become
active in Republican politics when you're this flaming liberal
and you've got the Congress of Racial Equality on one side. One
of the things that one needs to know about the Republican
party in Rhode Island is that it is the party that has been, since
the mills closed, and since the state became predominantly
worker class and democratic, that the really liberal party in the
state is the Republican party, it's not the Democrats. The
Democrats are the party of the status quo. They don't want
anything to change, they're a great majority. Republicans ran
women, minorities ... [tape stopped]
End Tape 1, Side 2

Tape 2, Side 1
MS: We were saying that the Republican Party had run women
and minorities years before the Democrats did. Kathleen
Connell, who is right now, is the first Democratic woman in an
office of importance in the state. She holds a statewide office
and she's the first one, and this is 1988? Years ago, the
Republicans ran minorities and women. Sometimes they won.
Claudine Schneider has been our representative. She's in her
third term as state representative: a woman, and a Republican.
Even in a predominantly Democratic state, we have one
Republican and one Democratic senator, and one Republican
and Democratic Representative. But anyway I got active in
Republican politics. It's very interesting because I was the
only voice in the wilderness that said that I would not vote for
Richard Nixon, that I would not vote for Spiro Agnew, that I
opposed, visibly and actively opposed the war. Some of the
men on the State Central Committee tried to get me thrown off
of there because of my stand, both my stand on the war and
my stand against Nixon, from the very beginning. They later
did come to me, years later and say, you were right on both

counts, let me just say it in public. But at any rate, anyway it
doesn't matter. But I was active in that, in that group. In
1966, you had Jim Former who was the Chair of, National Chair
of C.O.R.E. came, and at that point also in my life we began our
consciousness raising groups in Rhode Island, and that was
kind of interesting because, in the '70's later we began ...
JH:

And you played an organizational role?

MS: Yes, in these things. The other thing was that Arlene Tivin
was one of the first women to run for office in the state and
she ... and we all helped out in her campaign. I think she ran
for state representative. In 1967 I went to work at Roger
Williams Hospital School of Nursing teaching Anatomy,
Physiology and Microbiology. And I was also serving on the
Republican State Central Committee. I was still actively
engaged in anti-war work and ... one of the things that had
happened to C.O.R.E. at that point was it had gone all black.
They, black people wanted to control those organizations, and
so they wanted, they not only wanted any whites who were
officers out of them, but they also wanted the membership to
be all black. And it was tactically a good move to make at that
time, it was politically a good move, lots of noise, make lots of
publicity about it, draw people in. They unfortunately didn't
do that. The organization simply died from lack of
nourishment, I think, and lack of commitment. And the fact
that in basically black, most black women were struggling to
survive and did not have the time to devote. They may have
thought that a lot of white middle class wasp women were
dilitants of this but they were the ones that actually did the
driving organizational work for a lot of these organizations
and ... okay ... I once picketed, oh wow, Governor Chafee, a
Republican, was governor, I once picketed with my, both my
children for more welfare money. And it was picked up that I
was a member of the State Central Committee, and that I was
picketing the governor of whose same party, and it went over
not weB with the State Central Committee. But I was always
doing things like that; it didn't bother me. Okay, let's see, Jim

Former came back. Interestingly enough at the time when
there was a lot of problem with the attorney generals, with
some things like that in the country, they sent, Black Power,
remember the Black Power things. I spent an awful lot of my
time as a white person looking in an organization like that
explaining black power to other whites. That's what you had to
do, and that was, that was, you know, really quite interesting,
and trying to get people attuned to this and not afraid of it.
That was the major thing, that people were so afraid of this
whole thing. We were at the point of doing something with the
community action center. In 1968, just before C.O.R.E. went all
black by the way, we wrote the last check of, in the treasury at
that point to revive the school in South Providence, the
integrated school; they were going to close it. And so there was
a lot of, you know, the citywide bussing came in with the
support of the mayor at that point. So but those things were
all, there's a lot of seething, boiling going on both anti-war and
also the racial issues. At one point they sent a bunch of Black
Panthers were supposed to be coming to town. And I don't
believe they were Black Panthers at all, they were unscarred
didn't look like street people at all. I think they were the FBI,
they had 3000 dollars worth of plane tickets in their pockets
and they just didn't look right to me. But all kinds of things
like that were happening. I was on the Attorney General's list
in Washington as a subversive ... oh sure, I feel quite sure, I
later went to work for the government and I was wondering
how they ever, how they ever hired me. In 1969 also we were
looking at, I did the Cano lectures, my husband and I did Cano
lectures for Catholic Church, on marriage lectures, which we
thought was kind of interesting, it was the first time that that
had ever been integrated and then we did, I was calling around
and trying to get food for the marathon house which was just
founded. It was the drug abuse and drug addiction centers
that were just being founded then. And I was working on the,
in 1970, on the health, we founded the health task force of the
urban coalition. And that was the thing that, eventually what
grew out of that was the community health centers throughout
the city of Providence. In 1970 I was on a committee to

consider the future. I wasn't on it, I'm sorry, no, I attended the
committee meetings to consider the future of Pembroke, and I
think that I was asked to attend those meetings as a observer.
And I came up to some of them in the summertime and I do
remember those meetings. I remember the, I think, sense of
alarm in the students who were proposing the merger when
two years later it actually happened. I have a sense that they
were, they were very militant about it in the beginning, and
they were, wanted it to happen, but then I have a real sense of
the feeling of loss among those people when it finally
happened. I don't think I'm projecting that, I know I felt a
tremendous sense of loss, but I don't think that I am projecting
that. But I did go to observe these things. We didn't talk very
much, the other people, the working people at the committee
tables did that kind of thing, but we were asked to observe it,
and that was what inspired me really to write the article about
"Oh college, poor college." And what I said was that I thought
that Pembroke had the opportunity to do a special advocacy for
women. That was why I felt so terrible about losing it, was
that I think that that was gone. I didn't feel, and I said in the
article, I said that the Pembrokers were talking very, that the
Brown Administration was very sympathetic to them, and I
said yeah, that's fine, except Brown administration doesn't have
any responsibility for you. How are they going to be when
they're responsible? And I didn't really know how they would
be. And the other thing I suggested was that maybe, since I'm
not there anymore, that I really had no right to comment about
it at all. And I think that that's a posture that one could take,
one could say, well it's not my college anymore, I don't have
anything to do with it, the merger with Brown may suit the
needs of women ... and it certainly did suit them in one sense
and that was it made them able to take more women. You
were constrained by this living arrangement or by making
more and more dormitory space, or by moving some of the
women over to Brown. Brown I don't think would ever, ever
have-- well I don't know, they might have-- I was thinking
they probably wouldn't want to have put women over on the
campus, you know, if they kept the college and just increased

the number of women by 50%, to 50% I'm not sure Brown
would have done it. Brown had a commitment to maintaining
its undergraduate population at under 2000, now its under
5000, I don't know what it is, I think its under three, is it?

MS: Well, that shows where we ... are doing it. At this point in
1971--do you want me to talk more about the merger, do you,
do you, the article is there, I think that maybe ...
JH: It might be good just to get it on tape for whoever goes and
listens to this because, you know, they could always go back
and look at it, but just... I mean, how have your feeling changed
over the years, if at all? Seeing how its, you know like how did
you feel when you first found out about it? And how do you
feel now? And has that, those opinions gone through any
change at all?
MS: Well, I think I was being out of school, I was kind of
divorced from it. I wrote the article from a really felt need to
express my own personal opinions about it. And the article
basically compares ... I use the analogy of the Queen investing
Prince Phillip at that time with, she made him the Duke of,
Prince of Wales, rather. .. and didn't she feel it was kind of an
anachronism in modern society with people lopping off to the
moon and, to do this with the royal family ... I mean did it have
any meaning, at all? And he had said, well I think this is a
really great opportunity to do a special advocacy, to be
especially an advocate for those people in Wales, that's what I
see my role as being. And I sort of fused that as an analogy of
what the, Pembroke did too, was that it had this special sense
of advocacy for women, and that they needed it, and that I was
not totally convinced that the administration at Brown really

was attuned to that kind of thing. I also said that if the
administration at Pembroke had been super duper good, it
never would have happened. That we had a failing,
unresponsive administration in here, no role models for
women, no women, you know, married women with families
which is basically what, you know, most of the graduates of the
program even in the '70's were doing, no women who had
proved that you could have it all, no women who had homes
and families and careers and Ph.D.'s and things like that. And
those women existed. Heck, we educated more, we put more
PhD' out, women Ph.D.'s in this country in 1930's, than we have
any time since. It was a terrible Depression, people couldn't
get jobs, they went to college. There were all these wonderful
women educated to do everything. And they did nothing.
They were able to do nothing.
As a result we had an
administration right then that wasn't good as an administration
and it wasn't a good academic role model either.
JH: So in theory it was supposed to be very good but the
coordinate education system, was it just not living up to ...
MS:

Not the system-- this one.

This ...

JH: This one ...
MS: At that point, functioning, at that point for those women it
was non-functional. In my day, it certainly was. It wasn't
crashing ahead. It wasn't teaching me that I could do
something different, it wasn't doing anything like that. But for
the women in the '70's, just the beginning, the flower opening,
we had the first big women's meetings here. We had our
consciousness raising groups, we had the first big women's
meeting. I bought the first issues of Ms., 60 of them, the very
first one, the I ady in the, you know, W onderwoman on the
cover, and I took them to these meetings that were held down
at the Episcopal Cathedral clothes room, and I sold them in the
back. I sold everyone but two of them, I own two of them,
you know, these first editions, volume one, number one. It was

just beginning to flower, the urgency, the sense of women
beginning to move ahead, the sense of women trying to do
something, this admitted the administration at the time, this
place had these meetings going on, at the time people were
considering it, was not responsive to women. It was not doing
what it should have been doing. It should have been a really
aggressive administration.
JH:

So they missed a real crucial time ...

MS: They missed the crucial, the crucial convergence. If this
problem had come up even 4 years later, 4 years later, when
women were beginning to take control and women were
beginning to make lots of noise, I don't think they would have
wanted to merge with Brown. They would have handed Brown
an ultimatum-- we're going to be a residence college, we're
going to be a college devoted to women's studies, we're going to
be a segment of the university, but you are going to be co­
educational and you are going to be 50/50, as near 50/50, in
other words, as possible. That's what you're going to do. And
this, the ultimatum would have come from over here, not over
there. But you've got to grab the polit, you've got to get some
women in that administration over there and then you, but
there's token women over there now, there's still only token
women. Do you think Brown is looking for women, actively
seeking women for the presidency?
JH:

I don't think so.

MS: I don't think they are either. But I did feel, I did feel sad
about it because it had meant so much to me and because it
was, it was a wonderful enclave. You could come back here
and there was a kind of a sense of, a sense of peace. You have
to remember too that when I went to school, you know, we
were called the silent generation. AIJ this work, I am not
terribly unusual in how much community involvement that
I've had. There's a lot of other, if you interview a lot of other
women in my class, in my area, you're going to find the same

thing, that we went out and threw ourselves into the
commumtIes. But we didn't protest on the campus. Campus
protest was a thing of the future. Eisenhower was president.
Eisenhower got the Presidency. It told you a whole lot about
the tenor of the country. So when I'm looking at the Pembroke
of my time, and I'm feeling bad about that they're going to put
it in the closet for now, but I think the period of time that that
happened in, had it happened a little bit later, and women been
a little more powerful at the time it happened, it would have
been different. At the same time there was a report which I
talk about in my article, a lot of reporting going on about
Princeton admitting women, Yale-- see they wanted to know
whether to make a coordinate school like this. And this was
the best coordinate of all of them.
And if they had done it like
this at Princeton, that's what they were thinking about doing,
what should we do, just admit women or should we have this
college for them?
And so those kinds of things were coming
up too. They spent too much time looking at Radcliffe.
Radcliffe is a separate college, never was a Harvard school. So
it didn't change too much. Radcliffe is still admitting people
and Harvard is still admitting people, so you know, it didn't
really change that much. But I'm convinced that if the
consciousness raising and women talking to other women and
women suddenly realizing their oppression, had happened at
the time that these things were being considered I think it
would have been a very different outcome.
JH: Okay, so, I know you are currently involved with the Rhode
Island AIDS ...
MS: Yes, we had our first day. I am a nurse/epidemiologist
and we do a lot of, the nurse/epidemiologist by the way, we
founded the group that all of our group meets. There's only
one in every hospital, so it's infection control basically, and
what we do is, we decided in 1977 there were all these
wonderful policy books, you know they were all secret. We got
tired of inventing the wheel. We called all the other infection
control people in the state and said look, we need support, we

need peer support and everything else. I said, "Bring all your
policies, we'll have a meeting." We threw all the policies in the
middle of the hospital policies floor acute care, and ambulatory
care, and building management, all the rest of it, we threw
them in the middle of the table and said take what you need.
Develop them for your own place. And we did the end sharing,
as is the basic way you educate each other, when you do a job
that has no peer group within your hospital, or your place of
work. You have an outside, you develop an outside peer group.
And this is what we did. So we have a large group of people-­
we do all the health education, we do all the orientation. And
when AIDS came along in 1981, I remember reading the first
thing in the MMWR, that's the bible, we all, Morbidity Mortality
Weekly Report, a little newspaper that comes out in the center
for disease control, we all get that. And I remember reading
the first articles about the gay men with cat-c-sarcoma and
pneumocystis pneumonia, and we were trying to figure out
what it was that made them, you know made their lifestyle,
made them different. By 19, the end of 1982, we had our first
patients at the V A, and the, Rhode Island Hospital had seen
patients. And in 1983 we had several more patients. It was
quite evident, our problem was, we were lucky in the V A
because we could admit patients and keep them a lot longer
than they can in the private hospitals. And what happened
was we were concerned because there was no support outside
the hospital. Once you got the person out of the hospital there
was nothing.
JH: Right...
MS: So in 1985 in the summer, Boston had already formed a
group, they had already had the AIDS Action Committee in
Boston, we formed, with less than 20 patients in this state, we
formed the Rhode Island Project AIDS. And we developed a
board, we submitted grant money, grants, we were funded
about 6 months later by the Rhode Island Foundation, the
largest funding they had ever given, 36,000 for the first year
with promise it would be refunded afterwards, and many other

smaller grants. And I was the first president, I was elected
president, I think because I was a straight woman and the gay
men who were in the organization did not want the
organization to be known as a gay organization. I told them I
had no objections to being active in an organization or being
politically active. But they said no, they didn't want that, they
thought that the climate wasn't right for it. They also wanted
me, I think because I was interested and I was in on the
beginning of it and I was also politically very well connected.
My husband was in the governor's office writing speeches, my
son was in the governor's office as an administrative aide to
the governor, and I had a long history of active, political
actIvIsm. Even thought I am lovingly known in the governor's
office as "Chris' mother the communist," and he had lovingly
known, Christopher is lovingly known as a little to the right of
Attila the Hun. This is another thing that you have to realize
when you raise children no matter what your political
persuasions are, they are going to be something different. So it
just doesn't matter what it is, it's going to be different from you
and you just have to accept that. And so I functioned until
December of this last year as first President of the Board and
we hired an Executive Director this last year, two years ago, no
about a year, and we are functioning with probably we will
have a projected budget of over 300,000 for next year.
JH:

So it's just grown ...

MS: It's grown immensely. Well we have 150, probably as of
today, over 160 cases in the state. Over 50% of them are dead
now, but we also, this is just the cases that are reported, also
there's Arc patients, there's HIV positive people who are in
treatment. The resources of the community are being
stretched considerably, and as the, what's going to happen to
AIDS in the near future is that it will be predominantly a
disease of minority inner city people, and it's going to be more
and more difficult to get funding and to get concern and to get
people to work with these patients. Drug abusers are not
organized, they're difficult to educate, and I think that those

people are going to be seriously on the outs unless we have a
good base underneath us and are able to fund what we need to
fund. We need housing, we need services in the community,
maybe even halfway houses for them to live in when they're
sick but don't need to be hospitalized, things like that. So those
are all going to take a lot of money.
JH:

So you're still involved with these issues ...

MS: Yes, I am, but I have had to, I have had to cut back a lot
because of so much education that I'm doing. I'm still major
educator for health care workers in the state. I do a lot of that.
I do hospice care, teaching hospice volunteers. I do all the
education in my own hospital for all the different departments
on AIDS. And as the profession turns over so much you have
to keep doing it, crisis of health care professionals today. Some
of it for me, some of it just from women's issues, lack of respect
for women, for nurses, for their position in the hospitals and in
health care in general, their decision-making abilities, and they
have the abilities but they're never given the problems and
you know making decisions and not being involved in the
decision making about patients, things like that. They want
them to be responsible, but they don't want them to, I just
finished article on women, nurses and their role in decision
makings about resuscitation. And I chose a quote to title it
"The Responsible Powerless," and I think that really
exemplifies the position of women in the health care system.
They're responsible for resuscitating patients, for caring for
them before and after, and yet all the decisions that are made
on the behalf of the patient the nurse is never consulted.
JH: Do you see this position of nurses in any way reflective of
the society at large?
MS: Yes, oh yes definitely. It's a male oriented control,
administration control, and physician control... As more women
come into medicine and as more men go into nursing, those two
professions are going to find a lot more in common than they

have differences, but the women in medicine are going to
suffer the same kinds of failure to listen to them as nurses do,
as far as the administration, hospital administration is
concerned.
JH: And what other organizations are you currently involved
with?
MS:
Well, the project takes up a great deal of my time. I'm
still a member of Rhode Island State Nurses Association and I
occasionally do things for educational things for them. I teach
nursing ethics as well, that biomedical ethics and stuff
particularly in the framework of nursing to many groups
outside of my own hospital so that takes up a good deal of time.
Sometimes regionally or sometimes doing all day workshops
and things like that. So I'm involved in that. I belong to Sigma
Beta Tau which is the Nursing Honor Society and which brings
in speakers, and sometimes I speak for them and things of that
type. I was one of the people who founded the NOW chapter
here, and the Womens' Political Caucus, and the Win with
Women thing, and I have not been particularly politically
active in those things. They needed new people. I was going, I
was on to other things too, and I had not been terribly active. I
still give my money, and I still... In the beginning I had no
money to give. My husband got his Ph.D. in 1969, so you know,
we were graduate students poor from 1954 to 1969 which is a
heck of a long time to be like that, and ... but he was in English
and there was no support, there was very little support for
somebody getting in the Humanties. In the sciences you could
get totally supported. So I've always worked to help offset
part of those expenses. And now that we have the money, we
try to give money to these, we enjoy having the money to give
away. I think that's the real fun in having money is being able
to give it away. So that I am able to give money to some of
those things, also to Sojourner House and the Women's Center
and things of that nature, I was around when those were
getting off the ground too. And there's just not too much that
we can really do. I'm active in my professional organization,

which is the Association for Practitioners in Infection Control.
We are all deeply involved in the problems that AIDS has
caused in the health care setting and changing the way nurses
practice, the way physicians practice, the way we view
patients, who's accepted for health care, what kind of surgery
is done, and also we have to change all of the isolation policies
in all of our hospitals. So this is one of the reasons that I drew
back from some of the community affairs right now. Also my
mother is elderly and living with us, and requires my time. So
those kinds of things, I've just had to focus on the project. I
resined from the Presidency of the Board because of the stress
really of doing all the education on my own time. Because I
was on the board, the federal government construes that as
benefitting if you get money. I never took any money for any
of my speaking, but I used to require that they contribute to
the project, so that could be construed as income to my
benefitting, so I had to do it on vacation time, and that took up
an awful lot of my vacation time was spent, because I've done
35 major presentations in the last fiscal year. So, it was a
major, you know two hour, my slide show, travelling slide show
and all of that. And the ethics teaching and the other parts of
it. Trying to write, I also am actively involved in research on
methosol resistant [ ] and aminoglycocide resistent [
]
pneumonia, that I do with two physicians in our hospital, one
microbiologist, and two physicians, infectious disease
physicians from Pawtucket Memorial. So we have a very large
study going, and that also takes time. And much of that has to
be done outside of work because there's just no time to do it.
So it my spare time between 2:30 and 3 A.M., that's when my
spare time is. But you know it's been reasonable, a reasonably
busy life, when you consider that we were called the silent
generation and nobody expected anything from us. But I think
if you go out in these communities and you look at the
accomplishments of women, you know, in my generation of
graduation you're going to find that they're considerable. And
the thing that I think that is really so, the thing that's most
distressing to me about it is, that I've always done it for myself
and for my family. But I always think that deep down inside I

was asking, I was trying to get my college to notice
don't think they ever have, and I think it's because
woman. And I think they don't really value, what
university values is the money that people can give

me, and I
I'm a
this
to it.

End Tape 2, Side 1
Tape 2, Side 2
MS: I think that it values, it values the, either the money, or
the ... well not even the time because between us I think my
husband and I have given thousands of dollars to the
university in very small and subtle ways, like working for our
classes and raising money and being on the phone-a-thons
every year and just doing that sort of stuff. And I, that's not
the most important thing to me. The most important thing to
me is what I give back to its community. That's the most
important thing . And I think that it's time that Brown took
note of some of those kinds of contributions that don't show up
in dollars and cents to everybody. But they change the ... when
you look at it in Providence, I mean think about all over the
country, they spewed women out aU over the country to give
this . Women do this more than men, Jet's face it. And think as
if you were to compile what it has meant in various
communities, what this kind of work has meant in various
commumtles. It certainly changed the face of where Brown
lives , by what we have done.

JH:

So in all of these organizations that you have been involved
in, have they been predominantly women? You said e.O.R.E.
was ...

MS: Yes, C.O.R.E. was, yes a lot of women. White women, black
women, more black men than white men in the group ... but
again it had to do with the times and I think that today there
would be even more black women involved in something like
that. It was a very crosscultural thing too. I can remember
having the daughter of a very prominent Rhode Island family

come to me when she was a young woman in college saying
that she wanted to do community work and she particularly
wanted to do it in the racial stress area, you know where things
were not right in education and in opportunities for blacks
particularly, and other minority groups in Rhode Island. And
she had, she was talking to me about having no entree into this.
And it's true. One of the reasons her mother sent her to me
was because-- we knew each other from State Central
Committee-- was that I had a wide circle of friends,
particularly women friends in the black community, which
young women today do not have, unless they have made an
effort to do it, and unless there are people that they went to
school with. But they also tend to be middle class, and same
socioeconomic group as the whites that they're friendly with.
But even at, you go ... one of the things that's always distressed
me so much about Brown is the feeling that the black students
have for one reason or another that they have to be separate,
that so much of their activities does not include anybody else.
They do have the same kind of sense of oppression from whites
as women have oppression from men, and that's the only, I
mean, because I mean well doesn't mean anything. I'm still
part of the problem. And it's the same thing with men. You
may very often find men who mean very well and who are
very well educated and very progressive, but still there's the
aura hanging about them that they're part of the old boy
network, they're part of what's kept us down for such a long
time.
And I don't know if that ever goes away with the people
who've experienced that, but there is no entree to the working,
tough nuts and bolts work that needs to be done in the black
community. There's very, very little of it available to white
people today. And she was really acutely feeling that she
wanted to know, could I inject her into that, and I told her I
couldn't. That that area of entree, that my work with and my
friendship with those women was strictly friendship now, that
it was really social as much as anything else. And even so, one
of them died not too many, well it was last year sometime, and
I didn't even know. I was away at the time she died and I
didn't know until I read an obituary of her brother who died

later that she was dead. So you know, those kinds of losses you
really come more in that kind of contact that you don't have
with women that you loved.
JH: So where do women stand now? What's ahead of us?
What do we still need to do, have to do?
MS: Well, I think that in your generation if they don't get
complacent about it, has a much better opportunities. The
opportunities for you are unlimited. The only problems are the
choices. It's so hard to make those choices when there's so
much. There wasn't. Who would take us at the MBA, they
didn't take us at Harvard when I graduated. You couldn't get
into medical school. They would maybe take one a class or
something like that, some classes had none. You couldn't get
into law school. All of those kinds of barriers are now gone,
but the other kind, there are other kinds of psychological
barriers there because women are still trying to resolve the age
old problem of how do they combine femaleness and
motherhood with lifestyle. The other thing that's really
difficult is that not all women are going to want to marry, and
that society is still, is still hung up on that. The society has still
never really understood gay women, lesbian women, that those
kinds of things are still closed to them. And I think that that's
where your work has to be. In the next few years it's going to
be, it's going to be with those groups, with the disenfranchised
people who are still disenfranchised, you know, and it is very
acutely seen in these types of minorities, in the sexual
minontles. I hadn't thought about too much the relationship
between my work with racial minorities in the past and today
working with sexual minorities, and people closed to outside
the major part of society, although that's happening less and
less. I still find women much more reluctant to come out than
men. It strikes me as, I mean that just may be my experience
I don't know that that's really true or not. But those kinds of
getting the oppression off of those kinds of people, people of
color-- those things still have to be done, and those influence
women, because when you are woman and you are a person of

color or a sexual minority, you've still got a double whammy in
this change. So those kinds of things are going to be hard but
that's ... where you go is where you want to go, largely, I think ...
today. But still there's that question--when do I have my
children? Do I stay home with them? Do I split a job? And
there's still a lot of place among employers for creative
solutions to women's working problems: day care, splitting jobs,
which was popular a while back but hasn't surfaced too much
lately, mostly because of the benefits, the benefits issues,
things like that.
JH: There's one more thing I want to go back to, which is in
these, you played such an organizational role in a lot of these
groups and things that started, you know, you were ... charter
member, whatever, and how did you do that? I mean, was it
through connections you had built up already and you just
built on those?

MS:

Yes, yes, very much so, that's an interesting question. The
first thing, the first real thing was C.O.R.E. and Another Mother
for Peace. Those kinds of things sort of came together, the
active protests of the war movement. The women I met there
were militant women. They had to be at that time, I mean
really that was sort of a radical thing to do. When it came time
for the political movements and the women's movements, the
women I had been involved with in the Republican State
Central Committee, some of them were quite far out too, and
they sort of hooked up with, I was able to connect between
those women and the C.O.R.E. women and the, and others. And
then when you put a notice in the paper or something, or you
stuck a notice on a bulletin board, or you did it through
Pembroke Connections, a lot of it was through my classmates
and Pembroke connections as well, you'd say, "We're going to
start, we want to talk about women's health care," so when
those women began talking about women's health care. The
other thing I didn't tell you was that I also worked with, in the
early '70's, late '60's and early '70's, with childbirth education.
At the time I had my children, I had the first book of Lamaze

technique in the state. I had to order it, there were none, and I
was panting away in there, they brought the interns and the
residents to stand around the bed and look at somebody, "This
is Dr. Jones' little thing that's he's doing." Well we spent a good
deal of time in that organization trying to convince Women's
and Infant's Hospital which is the major delivery place to allow
fathers in the delivery room. The immediate world had fathers
in the delivery room except here. And I can remember sitting
in those groups with those big time father figure gynecologists
telling us that the fathers were going to fall over and all that
sort of stuff. Nobody had done the psychology that told us that
most men, the gynecologists disliked women to begin with, that
they liked the position of power that they had over women,
and that they didn't want husbands in the delivery room
because it took away from the devotion that the women had
toward them. So that was another thing I did. So those women
were also interested in these other things, and you would call
them up and say, ''I'm having a meeting for something or other
or we're forming this group, we're forming that, are you
interested in this that and the other thing." And so these
connections were like ripples throughout work.
JH:

So was there a real sense of a network of women?

MS: No, it wasn't formalized, it wasn't formalized. Ms. hadn't
started talking about networking; networking wasn't a thing
that we used. But Jean Whipple, who was one of the founding
mothers of this Win with Women thing in 1974, had a
tremendous sense of network. She was an advertising person
and a business women on her own right and she had a lot of
connections in the-- she got our artwork done for us, and when
you talk to somebody about doing your artwork, doing your
thing for you, they get interested in what they're doing, "Gh
this is great, I want to do something like this." I have a young
woman who's now doing, I just happened to contact her
because I was asked to give some material on AIDS to her
because she's doing a form, she's doing statewide forms, I was
on the committee which did the statewide forms for

considering major political issues from the people's point of
view, getting people interested in input to that. And we're
publishing a newspaper supplement and she needed some stuff
and she's interested now. She'll come in probably and do
something with one of these forms or one of these groups like
that and she'll meet other women who do that. And I think it
is all if you, someday it would be fun to just stick the stone in
the pond and find out who from C.O.R.E. was into the
consciousness raising, who from that was one into the Women's
Political Caucus, who was in that, who was in NOW, you know
those kinds of things. And I am contacting some of the other
women whom I haven't seen for quite a while who were
involved in this original political stuff because I want the
Farnham Archives to talk to those women too, because they've
all been doing different things since. But it's a very vital
community. The nice thing about Rhode Island is that it tends
to be ... like we met the legislators about the terrible testing
that the Board of Health wants, you know testing everybody
for AIDS, premarrows all sorts of stuff, very complicated
arguments as to why it's not going to work and why it's not
good and all that sort of stuff. But one of the things that the
legislator said to us was, "You know we don't have any
pressure from down under not to do this, or to do it. It all
comes from professionals like you people." I was meeting with
7 doctors in my sophomore meeting because we're the main
people who work with AIDS in the state, and we were trying to
tell them about what this testing really meant, and... I'm lost,
I'm trying to figure where was going with this whole thing.
Turn it off for a second. Let's just turn it off...

(Taps stops, starts again)
MS: It's not the people in the trenches that, I mean it's the
people like you in the trenches that really want something
done. The general constituency doesn't call us up and say
you've got to test everybody. It's not from them. And it's
always been my contention that you could do almost anything

in Rhode Island because Rhode Islanders don't care-- one
whole group doesn't care what you do as long as you pronounce
it right, and the other group doesn't care what you do so long
as it doesn't bother them. This is a very, basically a very
working class liberal state. They tend to make room for almost
all kinds of unusual behaviour. I'm convinced that if we could
just get the legislators out of the way we would have no
trouble in passing sexual protection legislation in this state.
I'm convinced that we would have no trouble passing all kinds
of radical legislation if we could just get the legislators to give
up the little piece of this thing that they're hanging on to. You
know, this is essentially a fight between the people, the AIDS
testing is essentially a fight between the people who care for
the patients and the people on the front lines and the people in
the Health Department and in the legislature. It's going to get
the Health Department big time points to have a nice contained
place like Rhode Island as an epidemiological greenhouse for
doing everything, you know. And that's where I think that
they're headed, and this has caused a considerable amount of
controversy among professionals. We have to do the
counseling; we have to pick up the pieces; you know, we have
to deal with false positives, as well as the false negatives.
Those kinds of things are not really considered when, mostly
when this kind of legislation gets passed.
JH: There's one last thing I wanted to ask you, and that was
that you said the women of your generation for being "silent
generation" were so involved in a lot of things, and had a large
impact on the way, you know, society has gone and these
organizations in that capacity. What is it that made them do
that, you think?
MS: I think, I think first of all that our education was good,
and when you're educated , you get out into the world and it
makes you think. And you can't look at situations very long,
you get out into the world and you sort of begin to look at
things. College campuses were very protected in the days that
I was in college. I can remember being down at Bethany and

never having read a newspaper the entire year that I was
there. Not having read a news magazine, not having heard the
radio-- we used to listen to music on the radio and stuff like
that-- and not really knowing what was going on in the world,
not knowing yet. And then coming up to Brown into a more
urban environment, and then of course Ti me magazine was
everywhere. We were all reading everything and much more
involved. But that insulation and incelerity that we developed
for ourselves was not at all uncommon. And I think that when
we got out into the world, we first of all bumped into our job
problems, and then we bumped into other kinds of things, and
the racial problems, the war problems, all the rest of those
kinds of things, began to impact on us, combine that with what
we, our education and the viewpoints that have been
inculcated in our education, and it was just that it was going to
happen. Also, because the majority of us when we were raising
our children, were at home, we were active mentally and bored
stiff, and I think that in the effort to get out, the first thing I
did when I had my second child was to go back to school. I
took the only thing that I could take that was advanced, I was
not going to go back into taking courses for no credit. I never
take courses for no credit unless it's something I really want.
But any rate, I wanted to earn some credits. I went to URI
extension which was right downtown here. University of
Rhode Island had an extension. And the only courses that I
could, offered a Master's Degree, that I could take was either
Business or English. That was the only two programs that they
had right at that moment. I had had all these undergraduate
courses in, I had one courseload of a major in English, I didn't
have to take the undergraduate courses so I just plopped into
that. It was just to get me out of the house and away from 2
year olds and newborns and diapers and that kind of junk, and
I needed that stimulus. So I started a slow process of taking
my Master's Degree which I didn't even get until 1972, while I
was in Nursing School, I picked up my master's degree in
English because they said, "You've got to write your thesis, kid,
or start all over," so I did it. But at any rate, I think that
women got out of college and they impacted on all that stuff

and then the world started pushing at them. That's why-- we
had the tools. We didn't do it while we were in college, but we
did it afterwards. And then later, while we were out on the
streets picketing, students were inside the university picketing.
We had begun to raise their voice in the university ...
JH:

But do you think that fed back into the university?

MS:

Yes definitely. I think that we all had a definite impact In
changing the course of the war. It took a while. But I
definitely think we had an impact, but ... And I never, the most
interesting thing happened to me. I was in Washington for the
dedication of the Vietnam Memorial. It was just like a full
circle, and here were these guys from the '60's-- they had
never left. They had never left the '60's. The beards, the long
hair, the fatigues, you know caught, caught in this time warp. I
mean many of them sick, really sick with post traumatic stress
syndrome, and just time warped. The women veterans who
were there didn't look like that at all. They did not look like
that at all. Their experience had been a little bit different, they
didn't look like that...
JH:

MS:

And yet they were able to work through it..

They had. I have 3 or 4 friends in Rhode Island who were
veterans. See, I'm in nursing and a lot of them were nurses,
and terrible, terrible things that they saw, and lived through.
But it seems to me that we have very, very few women
veterans in post traumatic stress syndrome care, to my
knowledge, at my own hospital we don't. And as I said they
were not on the front lines. Most of them were not shooting
people and involved in that, in a guerilla warfare which of
course nobody could ever win, ever, and especially not in that
Asian main. And you know, I just, it was just very interesting
to me that I had come full circle. I never ever protested the
war because, or protested America, except that one more
American should die in it, or one more Vietnamese should die
for oil rights in Southeast Asia. I mean basically what-- it was

an economic war. And I just didn't think that anybody else
should die. And I sure as heck didn't want my kids going. And
I knew that in '64 when they were babies that I had to do
something about it now, because those sort of things linger,
those festers linger. And so that's one of the reasons that I got
into that. And it was wonderful to come full circle and see that
dedication, it was wonderful, impressive.
JH: It's amazing, it's so powerful, I just remember seeing it and
we went with a school group and, you know, people had been
chatting on the bus before and this, you know, we were so
outside of that experience, and yet we went-- the names, the
endless names ...
MS: We've never done that in a war you know. I experienced
that same kind of feeling in France. We were driving along, we
had a little car which is the real way to see Europe, and we
were driving down this highway and we stopped at one of
these graveyards ... just as far as the eye could see, you know
you couldn't even see the end of it, were these little crosses
and these little Stars of David and stuff and they were all
Americans buried over there, you know. And you can't even
begin to cope with ... the Russians lost, like three million men ...
JH:

A whole generation ...

MS: ... two or three whole generations if you consider a
generation a ten year period. I mean, they had little kids go
and they had old men go, and they lost millions of people. We
can't even conceptualize it... And we just got figure out some
way to do this without killing people. So that's been a major
focus on my life, threatening, was the wars.
JH: Is there anything else you'd like to add?
think of?
MS:

I don't think so.

Anything you can

You must be very bored (laughs).

JH: Oh no, this has been incredible. It has been absolutely 

incredible... Okay, well, thank you so much. 

MS:

You're welcome.
