 Wilson  Killebrew  Today is April 6, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I   m in Tipton, Oklahoma today at the home of the  Killebrews, and I   m talking with Sam Killebrew today as part of the  Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history project. Thank you for having me  here.  Yes.  Would you mind telling me when and where you were born?  Twelve, twelve,    33, McAlester, Oklahoma.  And were you born at home?  At home, seven miles in the country.  What were your parents    names?  Tom and Kay Killebrew.  And were you the first child?  I was the third.  Were there more after you?  There were twins and one more, yes, there were three more.  So, six total?  Six.  5  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  What was your home like where you lived early on? Was it a farm?  Yes, we lived on a farm. My dad worked for a Gulf Oil Company.  What did he do for them?  He would go out on these excursions digging pipelines and everything.  That is how we ultimately came to Tipton. He was transferred here to  the oilfield out west of town.  Okay, so what year did you all end up moving here?  Actually in Tipton, 1937.  Did you have family in McAlester?  Yes. Both sides of my    In fact, my mother and dad   s families lived a  mile apart, in the country. (Laughter)  How had they come to the area, your grandparents? Do you know where  they   d come from to get to McAlester?  Tennessee. I think Tennessee was for my mother   s side. For my dad   s  side, I really don   t know.  And then your parents met because they lived a mile apart?  Yes, yes, they met there and were married. I had a lot of relatives, both  sides. One day, I would go, when we   d visit, I would play with relatives  on Mother   s side, cousins. And then the next day, I   d go with my dad   s  side and play with a lot of cousins.  So, when you moved to Tipton, were you able to go back to McAlester to  visit very often?  We would go on a vacation every year. Yes, we   d go back there. That   s  where we went.  What was Tipton like when you moved here in 1937?  It was a booming town. You know, each small town in that era was self-sufficient   with  your doctors, with your druggists, your grocery store,  your car dealers, furniture stores, five and dime. They were self-sufficient.  You really didn   t need to go anywhere else unless it was  something major. My life was really great back in that era. Of course, I  6  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  was four years old at the time, but I grew up here.  How old were you when you started to school?  Because of the way my birthday fell, I was five years old. So, when we  graduated, I was the youngest one in the class because of that.  Did you start to first grade? They didn   t have kindergarten?  Yes, that   s right. In fact, all my siblings started   no, they didn   t start,  they graduated from here.  So, where in town did you live when you moved here?  Various places. For the first three years we rented, and then my dad  bought a house on Rosso Street in about 1940, that   s where we lived.  Then we moved to the south part of town a little later.  So, were there a lot of people working with the oil business?  Back then, there was. Yes, yes. There was probably four or five, six  families that were permanent residents here. Some of them lived out  there on the site of the oil field. It was a pump station is what it was.  They relayed oil from various areas.  Was there a lot of oil in this area?  Back then, that was the only field that I actually knew that produced oil  was in Jackson County, mostly. There was one field south of Tipton, but  most of it was across the river.  I think of oil fields being kind of rowdy. Was Tipton? (Laughs)  Well, there weren   t that many people that affected it. They were, for that  era, pretty good paying jobs. In    37, I think four dollars a day. That was  pretty good pay, back then. All of them had large families, so I think it  probably took  3.95 a day to live, so it wasn   t real prosperous.  What were other people who lived in Tipton at the time doing?  This was farming, farming area, strictly farming. The whole economy  was farming. In fact, the school, when the school buses would come in  from your outlying areas, your rural areas, there were probably as many  kids living in the country as there were in town. There were six or seven  school buses that would just unload busloads of kids because, probably,  on every eighty acres, there was a family living. Most of the families  7  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  were pretty large, then.  What was school like?  It was fun. Now, in that day and age, it had to be good because you  didn   t have any options. I mean, all the kids, you were supposed to go,  and you did, and it was fun. You had your classmates. Most everyone  was of the same economic strata. Everyone was about the same. It was  very enjoyable.  How many kids were in your class, about?  When we started?  Yes.  Well, there were two first grades. There were probably about twenty or  twenty-one or two in each class. There was two sections.  And then when you graduated?  There were nineteen, is all.  What year did you graduate?  1951.  Were you active in sports or any clubs and organizations throughout  school?  My dad had seventeen cows. This was before we had electric milkers.  We delivered milk in Tipton. There was whole milk, Jersey milk, the big  cream line was the thing. A lot of cholesterol. (Laughter) We delivered  150 quarts of milk a day. Dad said,    You boys      like I say, I had three  brothers      You can play one sport. Pick your sport.    I wasn   t talented in  any sport except football, you didn   t have to be talented. So, I chose  football. That was my favorite sport.  When did you start playing?  Well, when I was a sophomore, probably.  And Tipton still has some pretty good sports teams.  Very good, very good. Yes.  8  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  So, did you do much traveling in football back then?  The farthest we went, back then in those old buses, the farthest we had  to travel was ninety miles. We thought that was really a long way.  (Laughter)  Where would that be to?  Erick, Oklahoma.  So, how long did your father continue working for Gulf Oil?  He worked, let me see, probably until about 1942, and he had received a  mandate. We were being transferred to Hobbs, New Mexico. He said  he   d been there one time and he didn   t want to raise his family in that  environment. So, that day he quit with, then, five kids. He quit his job.  Wow. Did he have any idea what he was going to do? (Laughs)  I really don   t know, but he worked for the public service company here  as a bookkeeper. And he worked in a grocery store and milked the cows.  What was the grocery store at the time called?  It was H H Grocery.  H H. And you all lived in town?  It was out of town, right across the street, city limit. Of course, now, the  city limit has been expanded. You might say we did live in town, but we  were outside the city limits.  So, there was room for all your cows right there.  Yes, yes.  How many did you have?  We had seventeen. We milked seventeen.  Wow. And did all the kids help?  Yes.  What were some of your other chores?  9  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Well, the thing that you would do, you would get up early, you would go  milk, you would bottle the milk, then you   d come in for breakfast. Then  you would go deliver the milk from the previous night that was in the  cooler all over town. You would bring the 150 milk bottles back, you  would hand wash them and stack them. Then it was eight o   clock. That  was chores. Then you went to work chopping cotton, pulling cotton,  whatever. Working in a grocery store. That was just chores, you know.  (Laughter)  Where would the milk bottles come from?  Well, we   d buy them. Empty bottles, I guess, sure, because there weren   t  any paper cartons. That was the main way of conveyance, was all glass.  So every day, you hand washed those 150?  Yes. Big sink that had three vats and a large drain board. We   d turn the  radio on and sing and have a good time. (Laughter)  Do you remember any radio programs in particular?  Well, it was KELT, Electra, Texas. They played good music. Of course,  it was, I guess you say top ten. It wasn   t strictly western at all. It was just  a good station, and we could get it. (Laughter)  What were the milk bottles capped with?  Well, we had caps. In fact, we still have one. It says Killebrew   s Raw  Milk. That was raw milk. That was before homogenized or pasteurized  and processed became popular. People really liked it because like I say,  they judged the milk by the cream line.  How big was that cream line, normally?  Well, it was sometimes   we milked Jersey cows and that cream line  was sometimes between a third and half of the milk bottle. See, this milk  that we   d milk, say, at night, we bottled it and put it in the cooler where  the water came up a certain    Then next morning, we   d take that out  and load it in the pickup and we   d put the fresh milk in there and deliver  that at night, that evening. So when it was cold, that cream line really  looked good. It was twenty cents a quart. The people you   d deliver to, if  you passed by your regular customer and they had two milk bottles, they  would be washed, and it would be forty cents and the bottle to pay for it.  Cash and carry. (Laughs)  And would they normally leave these on their front porch?  10  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Yes. Yes. Yes.  Could you explain a little bit more about the cooling system, with the  water?  Oh, this was pretty typical. There were a lot of dairies and a lot of farms,  and it was just a large cooler that had water in it, metal, and you   d just  set the metal frame   see, these were wire and we call them wire or  metal cases that you put the milk in. You just set it down and it would  immerse about half or more in cold, cold water. That   s how you kept it.  So, people in their homes, how quickly did they need to drink the milk  before it went   ?  Oh, it was just like milk today. Of course, it probably didn   t stay on their  porch five, ten minutes before it was in the refrigerator.  Okay, so they did have refrigerators.  Oh, yes. Yes. Yes.  And did you use a cream separator ever?  No, because we sold that cream in the milk.  How long did you all sell milk?  Let   s see, I would say from    45 until    52 or    53, 1952 or 1953. Then, all  the small dairies were going out of business and then your milk started  coming in cartons, homogenized and all. It was just the death nail for the  small. There wasn   t a place for that in the market anymore.  How many people were selling milk in Tipton when you were?  We were the only ones that did that, but there were several around that  sold to the dairies. They   d come around and pick it up. There was  probably three or four others in the area that had these big cans, these, I  don   t know what size, five or   these large cans. That   s the way they  sold it. They didn   t hand deliver it like we did.  And did you just put the milk on a truck?  Back end of the pickup and here we go.  So, after 1953 or    52     11  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Dad sold all the dairy equipment and got rid of the cows.  And then what did he do?  I think he worked for the Tipton Home as a carpenter. I was gone from     53 until    61, so I don   t really remember everyday what he did. He  farmed. He had an eighty acre farm.  What were his crops?  Cotton, alfalfa.  What did you do after high school?  I went to college at Cameron Junior College for two years. Then I  finished at Abilene Christian  College  (ACC) in Abilene, Texas. I  graduated. I had to go to Texas to find a wife. (Laughter) I met her, at  ACC I met her. She was from Sonora, Texas.  Okay, and what was her name?  Lois Lou Lomax.  What did you major in?  Believe it or not, I majored in agriculture because I was the only one of  the boys that wanted   I liked the dairy business. I really liked it. I liked  fooling with the cows and I liked the merchandise and selling milk and  all. So, when I graduated in    51 without any counselors   we didn   t have  counselors to see how adaptive you would be to any certain field. You  just picked what you want to do, art, dairy, farming, whatever, you  know. So, I chose that. Of course, when Dad sold the dairy and it went  out, I just went ahead and graduated down there. That wasn   t my first  love at all. It was dairy or farming, it was grocery business.  And did you get experience selling the milk through that, and did you  also work at a grocery?  I worked at a grocery store continuously from when I was twelve years  old until I quit in 1991.  What did you do when you were twelve?  I started sacking groceries and working in the store here at the H H  Grocery.  12  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  And would you carry the groceries out to people   s cars?  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  And then what did you move up to? What was your next job?  Well, when I went to college I worked in the grocery store in Lawton.  Then when I went to ACC, I worked on the campus. When my wife got  really serious about marrying me, I needed to make plans, so I started  working in a grocery store and I went ahead and graduated. When we  were married, I still worked   it was for a large chain of stores, and I  worked for six years. Then we moved back to Tipton and we bought an  old-time grocery store that had been in existence for years here, in 1961.  What was that called?  Hubble Grocery.  Were you nervous?  No, we were anticipating it because this is what I always wanted to do.  How many other groceries were in existence, here?  There were three other stores, two large ones in this town. This was a  small store, but it had been a family store for years and years and years.  What were the large ones, the names?  Walker Grocery and Right Price Grocery.  So, H H, did it still exist?  It sold to Walker   s.  So, was Hubble open when you bought it?  Yes, yes, yes.  So, you just took over.  Yes, we just bought it.  What was one of the first big changes you made, or did you make any  big moves in the beginning?  13  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  In two years after it, I did. The custom back then was to sell groceries on  credit. You would charge, people come and charge. Well, I didn   t  foresee the problem with that, but if you sell merchandise and you don   t  have any backup cash in the bank and you don   t get paid right then, your  shelves are going to be empty until they pay you, so you can put  something back on the shelf. After two years, Lois and I knew this  wasn   t going to work because you had to have a bankroll to be able to  sell groceries. So, we did the unthinkable. We went cash. We sold  everything for cash and our business boomed.  And because you took cash, you were able to put more on your shelves  and provide     Cheaper. Cheaper. More and better variety and very competitive because  we started buying from co-ops and we bought all   we were a member  of a co-op and dairy products, your ice cream products, your bread, and  of course, the groceries, too. We could buy probably as cheap as anyone,  so we could pass the savings on to the customer and still make a profit.  One of the main things small townspeople traded for on credit was for  convenience. It was convenience, but if someone had misfortune and  couldn   t pay you, you just lost the money. So, your shelf was empty.  The cash flow wasn   t there. But people were so receptive in this town. It  was amazing. The first day that we opened for cash, I had more money  in the register than I   d ever had. (Laughter) It was a process of people  getting the mindset. Of course, they paid cash in large towns, your  Uniteds and SafeWays. We were very fortunate, we had really great  people here. That enabled us to stay in business.  And you continued to own that store until when?     91, 1991, for thirty years.  What happened in 1991?  Well, a fellow from Michigan wanted to buy it, so we sold it to him.  (Laughter)  So, what happened with the other grocery stores, Walker and Right  Price, over the years?  They weren   t in existence, then.  When did they fall off?  Probably ten and five years, respectively, for the other two, before we  14  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  did.  Did you have shopping carts in your grocery store?  Oh, yes. We also had something younger people have not heard of  probably. A Ben Franklin store. Ben Franklin was a national, famous  variety store line. And we had one inside of our store. So, we really     What are some examples of things that would be sold there?  Oh, all notions. Your health and beauty supplies, tennis shoes, glasses,  coffee pots, paint, whatever. We had that inside our store. It really  worked out good.  Well, when did Tipton start seeing a decrease?  It actually started probably   when we sold the store in    91, there were  twelve hundred people in town, approximately. Then ten years later,  there was a thousand people. Now, there are about eight hundred. This  doesn   t count all the people that do not live in the country anymore. You  don   t have any country population at all, and farmers are farming much,  much more land than they ever have. There is no more hand labor,  which, when we first came here, there was a lot of hand labor such as  pulling cotton, chopping cotton, baling hay. All that is automatic now.  So, that was the demise of the small farming communities.  What was it like just being a business owner in general in Tipton over  those years?  It was great, because we were so fortunate. I was twenty-seven years  old, and we worked for ourselves. We never did work for anyone else  after that. Except, in reality, you were working for the public. (Laughs)  We literally   and Lois would agree with me   we enjoyed the last day  as much as we did the first day. We just really, we came along at the  right time in history to be in business here in Tipton.  And dealing with the co-ops, were you able to carry any products from  nearby?  Well, no, a co-op is like associated grocers. This is what it was. It was  like your canned goods. Everything you had in the grocery store. It  wasn   t any fresh produce or anything like that. It was all   everything  that came in the store, you were able to buy it. And it was to your  advantage to buy from a co-op. You could own it cheaper. It was a  salvation for small grocers to be able to   it   d be like a farmer being a  co-op, he couldn   t grow cotton and go out on his own and drive around  15  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  the country to see the best price he could get for his cotton, you know.  You need to be in a co-op. That   s about what this was.  Does Tipton have a Chamber of Commerce that you were involved with?  Oh, yes, yes. It had a Chamber of Commerce, yes.  Were there any businesses that disappeared while you had your store?  In the ensuing years, yes. When we came in    61, there were   I couldn   t  give you a count on how many businesses there were, but you can see  how many there are now, and probably 90 percent of them are gone, or  maybe 95 percent, because small agricultural towns have faded away.  This is not startling. It   s the evolution of business and the population  movement from the rural areas to large cities. It   s a natural chain of  events. There is nothing anyone could do to make it go back or change it  or stop it. That   s just the     Well, what do you see in the future for Tipton in that regard?  About like it is, now. We were fortunate here in school. We have an  excellent school system, here. We were, I think   just off the top of my  head   two or three or four years ago running around 250 students. And  this year, we   re back up to three hundred. That helps. Of course, your  small towns are school and church oriented, so everyone supports the  school. We really have a good school system, here.  And this weekend happens to be the     Alumni banquet. The 85th Annual Banquet.  Wow, have you kept count of how many you   ve been involved with?  No, no. But if you figure from 1951 to   would it be 61 years? Yes.  And you haven   t missed many?  Oh, yes, I   ve missed some because when we had the store. This was a  busy, busy weekend. Sometimes we didn   t go. But we go now.  And it   s quite an event.  Well, yes. It   s about the same thing every time, but it   s good to see  people, because the town will be full tomorrow. No one leaves Tipton on  Easter weekend. Everyone comes to Tipton.  16  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Well, going back to the milk business, you told me how people would  leave their money in the jars. Is that the primary way they would pay for  the milk?  Well, that was the way my dad and the customers did it, yes.  Did you or the person delivering the milk or did someone keep a ledger  with this?  I   m sure they didn   t. My dad had a big old fashioned leather change  purse. There used to be a little clasp like that, this was about that long,  and he always had it full of money. (Gestures) It was change and all. We  literally survived because of the dairy.  What was your mom   s role in all that?  She tried to cook and keep all the men   s clothes and food on the table  and make a garden and run the household and do everything. She  enjoyed it because that was her job. At one time, I had an older uncle  living with us. So that would be, let   s see, four boys, my dad, five, and  him, six. So, she had no help. We would go milk and come back into the  house before we delivered the milk. There would be gravy and biscuits,  homemade biscuits and eggs and everything. It wasn   t anything special.  That   s what mothers are supposed to do. (Laughter) Wash your clothes  and everything else.  Did she sew, too?  Oh, sure. She really relished being a housewife.  Did you all have ice cream very often?  Well, if we froze it, we did. Then after World War II, they started  putting out an air puffed, vegetable based concoction they called  mellorine, very cheap. Well, we ate that and thought that was really  good. It tasted like ice cream.  How did the war affect the community, here?  The war affected it because there was a demand for everything as far as  products, as far as gasoline, as far as tires, far as food, far as housing  because a lot of times if a couple was living, say, in some other town and  the husband all of a sudden was drafted into the army, maybe they had  one child or two children, it was better for the mother to move back to  Tipton to be around her folks and her family. So, the living quarters, it  was pushed to    It was a shortage of places to live. The town was full of  17  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  people, full of people.  Mostly women and children?  Yes. And then much more so when the war was over because a lot of  these same men came back and since farming was the main economic  factor here, they thought that they were going to be a farmer. Here   s kids  that are leaving home, some of them eighteen, nineteen years old, they  really didn   t have a chance to determine what they wanted in life, but  they were going to be a farmer. Some of them made it, some of them  didn   t.  And then there were some Germans in the area?  Well, they were all in a pen. (Laughs) This was the latter part of the war.  There was a shortage of labor because, like I say, all the young men  were gone. They were just gone. They were all fighting in different  branches of service. So, what to do with these German prisoners? They  shipped them inland to these farm areas such as Tipton. There was, I  think, two or three camps here in Oklahoma, I think. I don   t know where  for sure, but they would harvest the crops. Remember, there was no  mechanical harvest. It was all by hand. If cotton was harvested, it was all  pulled, hand-pulled. Hay was all stacked and baled at a time. Threshing  machine, everything had to be fed into the threshing machine. So, it was  extensive farm labor by hand. So, they got these Germans and they kept  them here in this camp. They paid them eighty cents a day for working.  They had it pretty good, a warm place to sleep, plenty of food, and got  paid.  And where was this camp located?  It was on my dad   s property. In fact, he bought about eight acres right up  the street. (Laughs) There was this big barn that had been the Gulf Oil  Company warehouse. In fact, it was a distributing point for Gulf  products. They were the jobber for Gulf Stations in addition to the  drilling and pumping forces they had going west of town. When that  ceased, he bought that and had this big wire fence around it. It was seven  feet tall and just about what the government needed, and he rented that  to the government and they turned it into a camp. He really got rich. He  rented it to the government for fifty dollars a month. Which would be  about, what, five hundred, now maybe?  How long did that last?  About a year and a half. Very quickly it went.  18  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Do you know how the government came to make this contact with your  father?  No, I was just twelve years old. But probably, some of the town officials  or the mayor or the bankers were trying to figure out a way because, like  I say, farming was the number one factor helping the economy. So,  people wanted to look out to be sure the crops were harvested. They  were there, and it was quite an adventure for a year and a half.  What do you remember about these   ?  Oh, I remember a lot because it was on our property. I remember the day  the troop train came and pulled   the siding out here   it stopped. I was  in town and I started to go home. Well, on every street in the southwest  and east part of town, there were armed guards, soldiers. It was cordoned  off where you couldn   t pass, but I had to because this was where I lived.  (Laughs) So, I got to go through. Then, too, we thought we were really  privileged because we would go across the field   we had a path going  to the school   and we would come within seventy-five yards of the  camp every time we came and went. We didn   t know much what was  going on, but we got to see the guard towers and the guys out there in it.  It was pretty exciting, I guess.  So, they built those guard towers.  Oh, yeah. They had three guard towers, tall, and they had lights down  the fences just like you   d see in these old movies, Stalag 17 or  something, the old movies. Yes, just like that. If a prisoner didn   t want  to work, I remember that they had a big barbed wire, shiny bright wire,  kind of a pen it looked like, if they refused to work, they   d put them in  this pen and give them bread and water. It gets hot in the summertime  just in a barb wire for your shade. They   d change in a day or two, and  they   d go back to work. But it was hot. And quickly it was gone. The  war was over.  And did they take down the guard towers and things like that?  Yes. My dad salvaged a lot of that, because some of these wooden  sidewalks, they made them out of ammunition cases and pallets because  when it would rain   they had tents. They had forty tents, I think about  six in each tent, and each one of them had a stove, because it used to get  cold here. They just pulled them all up and left. Dad took the big long tin  building that you see in the picture and he made apartments out of it  because there was a need for apartments after World War II.  In that same location?  19  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Population boom. A lot of kids were coming on the way when    So, it  was interesting. Still, we have people that will be people such as you,  maybe writing on history of prison camps or something. Every two or  three years, since our name is associated, Killebrews owned it, and  we   re getting to be the oldest people in town, we get calls. And it   s  interesting. They want to know the history of it and we can still   you  have access to it. We show up or go over there, and it   s a derelict  building, now. It   s owned by the city, that property is.  Did you ever feel endangered or nervous about   ?  No, no. Maybe some people have since, who are older, maybe they did.  But I was twelve years old. That was a big adventure. (Laughter)  Did the government ship in guards, to     Oh, yes. There were guards, yes.  Did they live in town or did they stay up there, too?  There was two or three houses, right little small houses, I guess that   s  where they lived. I guess. I really didn   t know. Two of the guards, at  least two, married Tipton girls. They met them here and lived here until  they died. It was just a fast paced thing, World War II. Things were  happening. It was a big deal, but then really, it wasn   t a big deal, too,  because things changed so quickly in history, as far as the war.  What was that prison camp called?  POW Camp. (Laughter) German Prisoner of War Camp.  And for helping out with the farming, how was that orchestrated? Did  they go to different farms in the area?  They had large, I   d call them, cotton trailers. The tractors or pickups  would pull, and they were large sideboards. Just like you   d load cotton.  They   d load them up with them and they   d take them out. What was  interesting, when they   d come in and out, they passed right by our house  and they   d be singing. They could sing good. It was interesting.  Did you pick up any German vocabulary words while they were here?  No, no.  I   ve actually talked with a few Germans that were in Prisoner of War  20  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  camps in the United States and came back to the US after the war was  over and have lived here since.  They were treated well. Much better than the way ours were.  Have you encountered any Germans that were here that have come  back?  No, no I haven   t. See, they would be dead because I   m seventy-eight and  they were probably twenty-one, twenty-five, so they   d have to be up in  the high nineties.  But over the years, no one     No, never did. But it really worked well as far as harvesting the cotton  and such. I did work in the field with one when I was twelve years old.  We were threshing hay. There was one or two there, but it was just like  another person. You weren   t in awe or anything. Sure, they talked a  different language, but they must have been the trustees. (Laughter)  Well, what has kept you in this area or in Tipton over the years?  Well, of course, this is our home. But the reason we wanted to move  back, we always   football has been a big thing in Tipton sports. When  we were living in Abilene, Texas, my brother Jack would say,    Oh, I  wish you could have been here Friday night. We played Snyder for the  district championship, and we won it in the last two minutes.    And I  thought,    Oh, my. I   m missing out on that.    We thought, well, I wish we  were living back there because he made it sound exciting and said,     After the game, we went by and Mother had a hot cherry pie.    I  thought,    Goodness, we   re missing out on this.    (Laughter) Lois did not  have any family. She was an only child. So, we thought about the  grocery business. She grew up in the grocery business. Her dad, in  Sonora, Texas, so it wasn   t a big change for her as far as that. We just  wanted to come back to a smaller town. That   s what we wanted. We sure  don   t regret it.  What   s your opinion on how the grocery business has changed over the  years?  It   s all Mr. Wal-Mart, now. Like it or not. Some of us who are older  resent the fact that there are no more small successful supermarkets in  towns.  Some of us who are younger do, too. (Laughs)  21  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  But you   ve got to think, this is the evolution of business. This is the way  it   s happening. People, when they went from little mom and pops to  larger supermarkets, they probably rallied against that also because  they   re ruining    But it   s just the way things are.  Do you think it will continue and the stores will get bigger and bigger?  Yes. Probably, yes. One stop, yes, the people love it. There is a danger  in that sometimes. If you do not know your prices, you will be paying  too much and unwittingly, you   ll think you   ll be getting a good deal,  when in reality you   re not. Some of these large, large producers, you do  not get as quality produce that you do in the smaller supermarkets like  say, United or local supermarkets. Sometimes they have better produce  and at a better price because big does not necessarily mean cheap. The  service in a larger one, you   re going to sacrifice getting waited on with  real friendly people because most of the time, not. Some cases, sure,  depends on the local manager. But you don   t get as much personal  attention.  So, where do you buy your groceries these days?  We cherry pick. Do you know what that means?  A little here and a little there?  Whoever has the best specials and where we have coupons.  Do you usually go to Altus?  Go to Altus. It   s nearly prohibitive here because there is not much  variety. It   s pretty high. Sometimes we buy at Sam   s. We reluctantly   in  fact, we didn   t buy a membership. We had one given to us as a gift.  We   ll buy, say, a large quantity of meat, such as boneless pork loins or  such as that, you know. Since I was a butcher, we   ll cut them up the way  we want it. I have a grinder. We   ll grind our own hamburger meat. Buy  a lean, lean cut such as boneless rump roast and we   ll go ahead and  grind it and package it ourselves because it   s much leaner than what you  could buy. We save money that way.  Where did you learn your butchering skills?  When I got a grocery store. I knew nothing about it, but you learn.  Did you have someone teach you?  Yes, we had a butcher.  22  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Well, what does Oklahoma mean to you?  I love Oklahoma because it   s a small inland state. We don   t have some  of the problems that the large, like next to the water, the ocean or the  ports and all that system. You might say,    Well, thinking small,    but  really, it seems like you can control your destiny. Oklahoma has a very  low unemployment rate, one of the lowest anywhere. There   s a lot of  wide open spaces. It   s a lot of freedoms that you have. Then, too, I like  sports and Oklahoma excels in sports. If you want vacations, you can go  to the water, go to Eastern Oklahoma, a lot of fishing and lakes. I like it.  I don   t think we have problems that some of the other places have.  Is there anything else we should talk about?  I don   t know. I don   t have any questions. (Laughter) It   s probably up to  each individual, really, where they want to live. It   s whatever you   re  seeking. Some people, my friends, would not live in Oklahoma or a  small town. It   s up to each individual what they   re looking for. The  churches are generally pretty strong in some of the smaller towns. It is  here in Tipton. That   s one of the prerequisites we have. Then we have  the Tipton Children   s Home, so there   s always a lot of excitement going  on here in this town.  And about how many kids are at the Tipton home?  About fifty-seven. We   re licensed for fifty-eight. What I mean by that,  the DHS, they license you as far as your square footage you have for the  residence and such as that. Although, we receive no finances off from  the government in any form or fashion. We wouldn   t take that because  we would lose our independence if we did.  What is your role, currently, with the Tipton Home?  I   m on the board of directors out there.  How long have you served on that?  Well, there   s one thing, like it or not, the Tipton home was set up in  1924. The board of directors were selected from the elders of the Church  of Christ. If you   re an elder, you don   t have a choice. You   re  automatically    (Laughs) So, I   ve been on twenty years.  Okay. So, you   ve been an elder for twenty years?  Yes.  23  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  Wilson  Killebrew  And have you seen the Home change a lot over that period of time?  Yes, yes, it   s changed. Childcare goes through different phases. Right  now, the politically correct thing is they like foster homing, as far as  legislators and different weird associations. But we do have the resident  care, and it   s the only thing I   ve known as far as taking care of kids. If  we can get kids at an early age, we can really do well. Sometimes when  we get children that are thirteen or fourteen years old that have been  exposed to some of the bad things, sometimes their culture is hard to  change. But if you can get them at an early age   and, too, if you can get  a family, two or three of the same family kids, if the DHS deems that  they need to be here, you can do some good. We   ve had some great  people that have graduated from there.  And tonight is the annual reunion?  Tonight is just a reception. Tomorrow is the official reunion at the  Home. Going to be a lot of people.  How many people do you estimate will be in town for the Home related  events?  It   s hard to separate the school and that, too. It   ll probably be    I don   t  know. The Tipton home is in its 88th year, which is pretty unusual for a  child-based care organization without any federal money, or wanting  any. But it   s interesting. It keeps Lois and I younger. (Laughter)  Well, when history is written about you, what would you like for it to  say?  He enjoyed the benefits of living in a loving, small town and  participating in activities because really, we wouldn   t live anywhere  else. Would you, Lois? (Laughter) A small town, too. One thing about a  small town, when people get older, they lose their spouse, their children  are all gone, grandchildren at some other location, they can live and  survive in a small town. Because we have neighbors that are ninety-five,  eighty-six. At church the other day on the front row were four people in  the ninety-year-old  category  and they were still living in their own  homes. Isn   t that something?  Yes.  If they lived in Oklahoma City, there is no way they could do that at all.  They   re happy and they   re active and they participate. Sure, they need  help here or there, but that   s what we   re here for.  24  Wilson  Killebrew  That   s wonderful. Well, thank you for visiting with me.  Enjoyed it. Enjoyed it.  -------  -------
