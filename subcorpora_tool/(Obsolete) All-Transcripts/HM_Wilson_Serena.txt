Speaker 1: My name is Reginnia Williams and I am the interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer today is Matthew Hickey and we have one observer for this morning's interview and that's Colonel Howard Wilson.  I'd just like to get started by asking if you would please state your name, your first, middle and last name and spell each if you would please?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My name is Serena Strother Wilson, S-E-R-E-N-A  S-T-R-O-T-H-E-R  W-I-L-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And would you also please state the date and location of your birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Edgefield, South Carolina, March 18, 1934.
Speaker 1: And would you also please state today's date for the record?
Speaker 2: Today's date is March 15th.  Is that right?
Speaker 1: Sixteenth.
Speaker 2: Oh March 16th.  Okay, let me start again.  Today's date is March 16th, 2005.  We're in Columbus, Ohio.
Speaker 1: And would you also please state the location of the interview including the address.
Speaker 2: We are in Columbus, Ohio.  The address is 2363 Summers Worth Drive and we're in Franklin County.
Speaker 1: And finally would you please state your occupation?
Speaker 2: My occupation presently is one of historian and griot. I'm retired from the Columbus Public Schools and also I am I guess a full time grandmother and great grandmother.  I do lectures and historical presentations about the Underground Railroad and I guess I'm a part time quilter also.

Speaker 1: Before we go any further would you like to explain the, the meaning of the carving that you're holding?
Speaker 2: Yes.  This is a carving from Nigeria, West Africa.  It's called a sankofa bird.  I was in Nigeria and the family that we were there visiting had a lot of children, in fact twelve was in the family.  And I said to one of them, "What a silly thing.  Look at that bird with its head turned backwards."  And they said "Oh this is not a silly bird.  This is the sankofa bird [from Akan mythology].  It's saying look back at your history and learn all you can about your family and then you'll know who you are and you can move forward."  So I decided that I would always keep a sankofa bird handy, I would tell my children about it, school children, university students, anyone that I met or talked to would learn about the sankofa bird.  So I think it's so important for people to know who they are and then they can appreciate what their ancestors did to get them thus far.

Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I really prefer meats.  Meats are my favorite food, meat and fish.  So right now vegetables because of my health and I know the value of good health now that I'm older so I guess apricots, all kinds of fruits, citrus you know just all kinds.
Speaker 1: All right.  And Mrs. Wilson do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Yes, the spring and the summer.  I'm from the South and I like warm weather.  I hate to see the flowers die and wither and so warm weather is my favorite time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, blue is my favorite color.  I think that was my mom's favorite color.  I was always surrounded by blue and then I appreciate the blue waters and the blue sky.  So I would say that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how about a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Ah,my favorite--I, anywhere in the tropics.  I will say any place in the tropics is my favorite vacation spot, probably Hawaii or Africa, even Charleston, South Carolina where my family is from. Savannah, Georgia.  I like the low country, the Gullah region.
Speaker 1: Okay, and finally for this set of questions do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, the 'Golden Rule.'  "Follow the Golden Rule" is one of my favorites and I think that it would just benefit everybody.  And it has so benefited my family to follow the Golden Rule.
Speaker 1: Okay, and just for the record would you state the Golden Rule for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" is the Golden Rule that we follow in my family.  I teach it to the children very early when they first learn to talk.  And then when I was teaching school I taught it to the school children.  I think that if people would learn that and practice it, it would keep down say, school suspensions, disharmony, divorces, even road rage could be solved.  Nations probably would not go to war if they were practicing the Golden Rule.
Story_ID: 15606
Speaker 1: I'd like to begin by asking if you could please tell us about your mother.  What was her name and where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Appling, [Columbia County] Georgia.  It's about twenty five miles from McCormick, South Carolina where my family eventually settled.  My mother is named Mary Eva McDaniel Strother and she was born in the late teens, probably around, I'd say after 1915.  She was reared on a farm.  They grew everything, even sugar cane to sweeten coffee or cake or whatever, they made their own syrups.  They were just very I'll say busy farmers.  Year round there was something to do on the farm.  So they had to make their bedding and this is how my mom got into quilting.  My grandmother quilted, my great grandmother, everyone made whatever they needed.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned your grandmother so for the record would you also please state the names of your maternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My grandmother was Nora Belle Farrow McDaniel and she was born in Georgia as was my grandfather Will McDaniel.  They were very sufficient.  They believed in being independent and owning their own things.  My grandmother was a person, I'll say a recycler.  She didn't throw away anything and so my mom learned that and then I too learned to recycle and not be wasteful.  So in learning to quilt we also used feed sacks or scraps of clothing.  The, the old clothes were recycled.  The good parts were then put into quilts.  So you might have a handmade quilt with maybe three or four generations of fabrics.  And we have continued that.  We make picture quilts now-a-days.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you mentioned also that your mother was raised on a farm and that they were pretty self sufficient.  So did they own their own land, the family?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did own their own land.  My grandfather, my mother's father Will McDaniel had come from Georgia.  He as a young boy had been on the land what is, where they now do the golf course, the Master's tournament.  He learned to weave baskets, chair bottoms, how to grow all kinds of plants and fruits and so as a young man being a farmer and then trading plants and vegetables and I'll say shrubs and trees, the young black, well ex-slaves then were the ones who did the work, build the houses, took care of the animals, that type of work.  So my great grandfather purchased some land in McCormick County.  We still own seventy five acres of the hundred and fifty acres that they purchased.  We pay the taxes so that it can be handed down to the younger generations.  We take our children there, our grandchildren to make sure that they know where they come from and where their roots are.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said the family eventually moved from Georgia--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to the Carolinas.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when did that move take place?
Speaker 2: We believe that it was the early 1900s because my grandfather was born in the early 1850s.  And so in the census data we have found he and my grandmother--on a visit this past fall to Salt Lake City, Utah, we visited the family center [Family History Library] in Salt Lake City.  So we were able to find them in Akin, South Carolina after Appling, Georgia.  Then we were able to locate them in McCormick County so we know it was around the turn of the century [McCormick County was created in 1916].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you mentioned that the patriarch of the family purchased land in Georgia.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the Family Center run by the Mormons helped you put all of that together?
Speaker 2: Okay, my grandparents moved from Appling, Georgia--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --where my great grandfather and his wife, Meliza Farrow--my great grandfather was a blacksmith and so he could travel more freely than some other slaves during slavery time.  My great grandmother was a midwife so she too could travel delivering babies and helping people with medicine.  So when they moved around they decided I guess to settle in South Carolina and then they brought their family to South Carolina.  They settled near Edgefield and McCormick.  Edgefield County and McCormick County border each other so this is where the land was purchased.  My great grandfather Peter Farrow, Reverend Peter Farrow, pastored a church called Springfield Baptist Church.  It's there in the country and when we go South we visit that church.  My great grandmother and my great grandfather are buried there.  My grandmother, Nora Farrow McDaniel had a farm very near this church so she and my grandfather are buried there in that same county.  They reared nine children there and of course my mother being the oldest did a lot of the work such as quilting and canning, raising cotton corn, large vegetable garden where they would preserve the food even for the whole winter.
Speaker 1: So Mrs. Wilson have you completed your family tree or any kind of genealogical work because you seem to have a lot of detailed information about your family history going back for generations?
Speaker 2: Yes we, we can go back generations because we know from one family member handing down the oral history when we couldn't read and write to the other younger family members.  So we know that we are Ibos because my great grandfather would say, "Come my little Ibo girl.  Sit on my lap.  Let's say the ABCs or let's say your numbers."  And so information has been passed down like that.  My great grandmother was branded with a 'D' and we think it may have been for Dahomey or perhaps the name of a ship, we're not sure.  But whatever, we do know that we're from West Africa and we do know that the Ibo people are known for courage and maybe for business.  A lot of them go into business.  They believe in being self-sufficient and so this is how I happen to you know have this particular heritage rather than one of the Hausa or the Yoruba or something else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then that oral history that you said was so important to passing the knowledge from one generation to the next, that's supported by the information in the archival collections--?
Speaker 2: Well--.
Speaker 1: --like the Family Center in Salt Lake City?
Speaker 2: It's supported in that we know the people lived but we do not know exactly the occupations except that they were poor farmers.  I don't know if my great grandfather earned any money being a minister but I know that he earned money being a blacksmith because all the horses and mules had to have shoes, they all had to, all the farms had to have tools.  The blacksmith made the tools.  Anything iron, anything metal was made by the blacksmith.  We know that this village Awka in Anambra state [Nigeria] is known for blacksmith work and we know that the Chief Carroll Ukuchuwu (ph.) said that many of the blacksmiths were stolen or kidnapped away during slavery time just for those skills, that the metalwork in New Orleans and Charleston, South Carolina would have been done by these slaves.
Story_ID: 15607
Speaker 1: We spent some really productive time I think discussing your mother's side of the family but I'm wondering also if you had access to that same kind of information about your father's side?
Speaker 2: I--.
Speaker 1: If you could tell us his name, where he was born?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a matter of fact, I belong to the Strother Society.  My great-great-great grandfather was William Strother and he came by ship from England into the United States probably Ellis Island.  And he probably had to pay his way where my mom's side got the poor, awful cheap ride, free ride.  My father Milton John Strother was born in Edgefield County.  He was a European American or white man and he married the first wife, Martha Strother in the 1800s.  He was born around 1861 and I think that this is kind of unusual because not many people would have fathers who were say seventy seven, seventy eight, seventy nine when they're born, most of the time that's a grandfather or a great grandfather's age.  So my father, Milton Strother was a professor in Edgefield County.  He worked at the time when Strom Thurmond's father, Senator Strom Thurmond, the late Strom Thurmond was governor from my little town in Edgefield, South Carolina--ten governors and lieutenant governors have gone to Columbia to serve the state.  And so my father used to write speeches for the politicians.  His family was quite prominent.  During slavery time I'm told that his family owned two hundred and fifty slaves.  He was taught by the slaves to ride, to hunt, to fish and he did have a black wet nurse and that's a person who would relieve the mother of the maternal duties such as nursing, diapering and taking care of him.  And so evidently this family talked about the Golden Rule, however he as a son of this white family practiced the Golden Rule in that he married two African American wives and reared thirteen children.  My brother, Benjamin Strother, my sister Viola Strother Witcher (ph.) and I are the last three children and we were born when he was in his late seventies.  He continued to even after retiring as colored school superintendent, he continued to teach in church, people how to own property, how to pay taxes, how to read and write after church services on Sunday.  Our church is Pleasant Grove Baptist Church in now Edgefield.  It's on the property, on the land that was owned by grandfather the slaveholder David Strother and one of my European American cousins, Lynn Borum (ph.) lives in the plantation house there on that property.  It's about four miles out of the village of Edgefield.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So on your family tree then you have as far as your ancestors are concerned both enslaved individuals--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and folks who were slaveholders?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, makes for a fascinating history (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It's unusual I think probably that I would be able to know these people.  They're very friendly.  The Strother Society meets in Fredericksburg or Williamsburg or around Charlottesville every two years.  There's a newsletter that they send out and my sister and I and my late brother Benjamin Strother are members of this society.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I wanted to ask also about your father's childhood, if you have any information on--I know you said it was a very well to do family.  It must have been if they owned over two hundred slaves.  But do you have any stories about what life was like for him and other children in that household?
Speaker 2: Well my father passed when I was about six years old.  However, I do know from my mom and the faint memories that I have of him his childhood was one of I guess you would say wealth in that they owned a buggy and horse stable.  They made buggies and wagons and of course sold horses and I understand they even had a rental business of livestock that people could come and rent a buggy or they could come and rent a horse.  When cars came into being I guess they were invented around say the 1912 through 1914 and cars weren't really on the roads at that time in every little rural area, my father was one of the first people to own a car and to drive a car in Edgefield County.  His family sent people to Detroit and they got these cars, they brought them back and that he had a Model T Ford.  We have a picture of him with my sister and my mom and brother standing beside a Studebaker car so that was his last car that I can recall was this black Studebaker.  But as a child I understand that he learned to shoot, that he could a gun at a hundred yards and drive a nail through a tree, that he was an excellent marksman.  I understand that as a child also he would teach the slaves in the woods how to read and write by using a stick on the ground.  He taught them their ABCs and their numbers, he would teach the slave children.  Then when freedom came, he of course was very interested along with other freed men in black people learning to read and write and taking their rightful place in society.  So Edgefield, South Carolina is one of the well documented places where black people owned a lot of land.  Of course now days many people have migrated to the north and the children have lost the land or sold it.  But my last nephew just passed in his late eighties recently in Edgefield, South Carolina from my father's first set of children.  The first wife Martha Strother and he played together as children.  Then I guess later he fell in love and married.  So I did ask my Caucasian cousin Lynn Borum, "What did your family say about Milton marrying these black women?"  And she said they said, "Well you know Milton has always been crazy.  Don't mess with him, he'll shoot you."  So he had a reputation for having a very bad temper and for upholding the rights of black people, taking them to the polls to vote in Edgefield County, carrying them to church if they needed a ride.  And most of the time when I go South somebody will say "Oh you're Milton's daughter." and I'll say, "Yes."  And they'll say, "Well you know he used to raise more money for those colored schools than anybody."  Or "You know, he would always have something good to say about those colored people."  And I said, "You know we're African American now."  But we have gone from being "niggers" to  "colored" to "Negroes" and now "African Americans."  So I think we have a very rich heritage in Edgefield County because of the work that he did with all people.
Speaker 1: You know I have to ask because you brought the subject up about love and marriage across the color line.  And maybe they thought your father was crazy but in the South well into the twentieth century it was illegal to marry someone of a different race.  So are there any stories about run-ins with the law in the South--?
Speaker 2: All the time.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --because he had a black wife?
Speaker 2: All the time.  When I was a, a small child I can remember that my father in our house had a gun rack up over the front door and one up over the kitchen door.  I remember that he was on the front porch in a rocking chair with a gun beside his chair.  And I think it wasn't just for the rabbits that would hop across the yard.  On one occasion I remember the story that he was a young man and one of his sons and there were six or seven at the time came to church with his wife and the baby, but there were some people who came to church just for the socialization of the occasion.  And so the man had been drinking and he was cursing on the church ground.  At that time it was a no-no and some churches now it's still a no-no.  But anyway, one of my brothers said to this young man, you'll have to go someplace else with that cursing.  We don't allow that around here.  And the fellow got into an argument with this particular brother, the man shot his pistol and the gun fire hit the young wife and baby.  The man that did the shooting was then shot and he didn't die right away.  But someone went inside the church and got my father Milton Strother and said, "Your son has been shot."  And so he said, "Well quickly get the horse and wagon," and they put the man on the ground, put the wife and baby in the wagon and took them in town to the doctor.  And the doctor would not see or treat the man that had shot Milton's daughter in law.  So I know he was very well thought of in that town.  The doctor was his nephew, Dr. Donovan, which was a Caucasian doctor.  When I was a child I don't recall that there was ever a black doctor but there were plenty of midwives and people who knew medicine that would treat black people.  But other than him always being interested in education, always stopping the Ku Klux Klan from beating somebody, he and his brothers and some of the people that worked for them would get the word--send word by horseback or on foot to whoever was supposed to be beaten or run out of town or even tarred and feathered which was a horrible way to die or to suffer.  But they would intercede on the person's behalf, get them either to Augusta, Georgia or to Columbia, South Carolina which is about forty miles from Edgefield and they would get that person North which they would say "up the road."  The person was going to be "going up the road." And then later they would try to get the family members north to that person.  So my older brothers and sisters took me South, I mean took me North after my father passed.  I was sent to Philadelphia to a private school and then my brother, my sister, also we were not educated in Edgefield County.  The schools weren't at their best but Strom Thurmond, Senator Strom Thurmond did make a difference in that he did help fund the schools, the college, South Carolina State where his daughter attended.  He did start vocational schools in our state.  So there were some good things about Strom Thurmond even though he was a staunch segregationist at one time.
Story_ID: 15608
Speaker 1: At the end of the last segment you were telling us about your miscegenated family tree and love and marriage across the color lines.  And you mention that your father's [Milton John Strother] family owned over two hundred slaves.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I'm just curious, when freedom came, the end of the civil war in 1865, what became of those two hundred plus African American people who had been enslaved there?
Speaker 2: The Emancipation Proclamation of course freed the people who were in the states where there was rebellion against the Union so South Carolina was one of those states.  And of course the slaves then had the choice of continuing to work as sharecroppers or for pay they could go to other places.  Many of them chose to go north with the Union soldiers and a few because there was a freedmen bureau, Edgefield is the county seat in Edgefield [county], South Carolina and so the freedman bureau was there.  And my father was very instrumental in helping to set up public schools, helping to teach people to read and write even at church.  Like many times the, the children, the young people could not leave home because they needed to grow the crops.  And eating was more important than reading and writing.  Then some families would have just the older people to remain on the farmland and stay in the houses where the others would have chosen to go with the young people and leave maybe with the union soldiers.  There were many people who had skills and they could earn money with those skills.  And so throughout Edgefield there are many, throughout that county there are many families who have been there since slavery time like my family, the McDaniels, the Farrells as well as the free white people.  The church that my family attends was first attended by the Strothers.  It was built by those slaves and when freedom came, they then kept that church.  It was a wooden church with a rock and brick foundation.  The Strothers then had a brick church in the Village of Edgefield that they began to attend so that when I go to Pleasant Grove Baptist Church in Edgefield County, I know that that church has the foundation that was built by my black and white ancestors.  I know that I'm on my own land even if not on it now with a deed, I know that that's my property.  For five miles up the road as they say was owned by [her grandfather] David Strother.  And then in that same vicinity is the Strom Thurmond land and of course they owned land in Aiken or I don't know if they still own it but at one time they owned land throughout Edgefield County.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in effect then your white ancestors lost a lot of their slave property with the Emancipation Proclamation and then the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution?
Speaker 2: I'm sure that they did.  I have not read that any place, but just the fact that the freedmen, the Freedmen's Bureau would give land to black people if it wasn't being used they felt like they could do that and this really angered the white population.  As a result there were some people called the "pattyrollers" [patrollers] that would go around shooting, drowning, tar and feathering blacks.  There was a movie, I was trying to remember the name of it but Mohammed Ali played in that movie and it was about Edgefield County and how he as a young black senator went to Charleston to help make new rules during this particular period right after slavery time, the Reconstruction period.  And more than seventy-five slaves or no, ex-slaves, freedmen now, were holed up in a house in Edgefield County and they were attacked and not allowed to go out for food or water.  And all of these people were killed except maybe just a few children.  And it was a result of the Ku Klux Klan forming, not wanting the people to have land or to have the right to vote and so they just terrorized the people in that county.  Many of those people's relatives from other places moved north or to Charleston or to some other location as a result of the cruelty that was heaped upon them in Edgefield County.
Story_ID: 15609
Speaker 1: Mrs. Wilson your--this chapter in your history is just fascinating for me because you're describing a kind of interracial cooperation that wouldn't normally associate with the turn of the century American south.  And there's so many other examples in American history where we don't have that kind of cooperation across the color line.  And I'm thinking especially of the Thomas Jefferson, Sally Hemings chapter in American history.  Why do you think your family was able to enjoy that kind of cooperation and experiences at Pleasant Grove in other families like the Jefferson/Hemings clan are still warring about who gets to be buried in Monticello?
Speaker 2: I think that because the Strothers talked about the Golden Rule, many of the younger people coming after those older slave masters and mistresses practiced the Golden Rule so that today it's a legacy on both sides.  You know one where there were members of the Klan and the other where they were free and they felt like they had the right to all the privileges that the constitution guarantees.  And so my father would always say to us, "Never be feeling like you're inferior, always feel superior because you're an American and you are a Strother."  And so I have told my children and my grandchildren, we do things a certain way because we are Strothers or we are Wilsons and I tried to instill pride.  Even when I was teaching school I would say to the children, you are my little kings and queens.  Many of the teachers had the Bluebird reading group or the Astronauts or some other pet name for the reading groups.  But I would make crowns for the heads of my little students and I did work from elementary first in 1968 at (Brenton L.?) Elementary here in Columbus, Ohio and then I taught in Heidelberg, Germany.  I taught elementary there.  I'm certified in seven or eight areas so that wherever we moved on the army base when [husband] Howard [Wilson] was serving in the United States Army I would be able to have gainful employment if I chose to.  So in Berlin I taught high school and I would always tell the children you know, "Be proud.  Remember one important thing about your family and be proud of who you are."  And so I think that it's a matter of instilling pride in the family when they're quite young and then telling them some good things about their ancestors, not just let them assume because of their color or the location of their birth that they are a certain way.  I think that's just more stereotyping that we don't need.
Story_ID: 15610
Speaker 1: You mentioned during the tape change that your father was not the only white man in the South who loved across the color line and you mentioned the name of Strom Thurmond.  And so I--and because his name has been in the news in recent years--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --because of his African American daughter [Essie Mae Washington- Williams], I wonder if you could talk about his place in Southern history and again how the knowledge of that relationship that he had with that young African American woman was handled so, so differently from the loving relationship that you've described between your parents?  Why do you suppose that was the case with Strom Thurmond?
Speaker 2: Well I don't really personally know Strom Thurmond, however from what my family has said about Strom Thurmond from remembering going to the governor's mansion in Columbia when I was a child with my father, my father and mother, I would have to say that perhaps Strom Thurmond had a split personality.  I don't really know that much about him but I know that he had a fondness for black people and yet when he would get in front of the camera or he would be on the radio in the South, he would say very derogatory things about black people.  However, we called it "sleeping black and talking white." He did a lot for Edgefield County.  He did a lot for the state university, South Carolina State University where his [African American] daughter attended.  Many people in the South are very, I'd say kind and would practice democracy except they'd been stereotyped for so many years that they think they have to behave one way in public and another way in private.  But when Strom Thurmond's daughter was on the campus as South Carolina State University, I understand that the school wanted for nothing.  And that she was very well treated.  Many black people knew about her, knew who she was and the people in Aiken and Edgefield County knew that Strom Thurmond had a relationship with this African American lady whom he treated very well also.  She had a lovely home, it was always nicely landscaped you know.  She seemed to be just an average American, African American lady.
Story_ID: 15611
Speaker 1: I'd like to hear more about your childhood although I enjoy the information you shared about your parents, but your childhood in the South.  Were most of those early memories that you have of growing up in the South pleasant ones and if so, what are some of the earliest ones?
Speaker 2: Well one of my earliest memories is my sister [Viola Strother] teaching me to walk.  I learned to walk by holding one hand on the side of the wall, my sister holding my other hand and her hand on the other side of the hallway wall so I wouldn't pull her down.  So I actually remember her saying "Get up Serena."  Get up again.  Get up."  And if I fell she would say, "Get back up, get back up."  And she continued to encourage me to walk.  My brother [Benjamin Strother ] who is two years younger than me was the baby and she said, "Mama said she's not going to keep carrying you around.  You're going to have to walk."  And that, that's really one of my earliest memories.  The house we were in [in Edgefield County, South Carolina] was a wooden frame house and it had four bedrooms.  It had a closet that we had what we called the slop jar.  It was like a little potty that the children used if it was dark or if it was raining and we didn't want to go outside to the toilet that was out behind the house.  So I can remember when it rained my mother [Mary Eva McDaniel Strother] was very superstitious.  She would keep us quiet.  In fact often times we would take a nap and we would hear the rain hitting on the tin roof.  So when my father was in his late seventies, early eighties.  He had a smaller wooden frame house which was very different from the house that he had his first wife in.  The first house had burned.  My sister Viola was born in this very fine house, very fancy ornate metalwork around the porch, columns, marble steps.  However, when I was born, I was born in the wooden house where I guess it was maybe the same distance about three miles from town.  The area was called 'The Promised Land' where we lived and it was just outside of town.  I think that it was called the Promised Land because it had been given to black people and my [Caucasian] father [Milton John Strother] could have lived throughout the county or the state for that matter, but he chose to live among the black people that he cared a lot for and that he was always trying to educate in elementary, high school and then a school called Bettis Academy that was located in Trenton maybe about fifteen miles from the village of Edgefield.  There you could get a secondary teaching certificate and it was like a two year college.  It had been founded in the early--no, that's wrong, it had been founded in the mid eighteenth century [sic, early twentieth century].  Many of my relatives, my older brothers, cousins, nieces attended Bettis Academy.  We visited that school as adults.  We had a family reunion and we visited that school.  One lady who graduated in 1934 was in her eighties and she told me, "I remember Milton Strother because one of my friends said, 'That's a black man, he just looks white.'  And then another girl said, 'No he's white.  Look at his skin.'  And then another friend of hers said, 'I think he's colored because he comes to see my aunt and he always brings a lot of food when he comes to the school.  He brings hams and chickens and all kinds of things.'"  I remember my father would take us to Bettis Academy the 4th of July they would have a big celebration.  Also the 30th of May.  I think that people in the South who remembered some of their relatives from the Civil War celebrated this particular day more than the 4th of July because of what it meant to them.  It was more of a Memorial Day when you honored the dead that was in your family, the loved ones who had gone.  So I can remember my father saying you'll have to learn these ABCs and he would have us to write our ABCs.  He always had a pencil.  We also had something called a slate board and we could just erase it with a cloth and then we could write on it again.  We used chalk or we used charcoal from the fireplace to write on it.  I can remember that my father wanted us to be able to spell our names and my nickname was doll and so I would write D-O-L-L and then he would say no, you have to write S-E-R-E-N-A S-T-R-O-T-H-E-R.  Then my sister would do the same.  And if I made a mistake then she being two years older would correct me.  So we learned to read a little bit and write a little bit.  We learned our numbers before we went to school where now children mostly learn that in kindergarten if the families don't teach at home.  Another early memory, I could read run, I could read nigger, N-I-G-G-E-R, and I remember seeing that sign in the window.  We went into town in this Studebaker car.  I'll show you a picture of it I have here.  But anyway, when we got into town there was a sign in the window and it said "Run nigger run.  If you can't read run anyhow," H-O-W.  And so my father went in with us and he asked the man to take the sign down.  And the man said "Uncle Milton I want to leave my sign up.  I, I want everybody to see this sign."  But he did take it down at least while we were in town that Saturday.  Another early memory I had is my father would take us into a drug store.  They sold ice cream and they had ice in a cooler and it was chipped with an ice pick and then you could get ice in a glass with soda pop.  We called it pop, a flavored sugar water drink in the south.  But anyway, sometimes people would come in while we were there and they would have to take this soda pop bottle outside to drink it without ice just drinking out of the bottle.  But my father would take us in, he would sit us in these wire legged chairs with the wooden bottle and it would be perhaps four chairs at a round wooden top table.  And the girl behind the counter at the soda fountain would say, "Uncle Milton you know those colored children can't eat ice cream and drink sodas in here."  And he would say, "Bring three cones of ice cream and one dish.  Make it vanilla." And then she would bring it.  Sometimes he would ask for peach ice cream cause peaches were very prevalent in our state.  So we enjoyed I would say because he was Caucasian and because it seemed that to me everybody called him Uncle because he was an older man.  But only after we had a family reunion about fifteen years ago in Edgefield I found out that he was related to all these people, that they were his kinfolk.  And so when they would be calling him Uncle Milton, they were really relatives.  So that's one experience with the ice cream.  Another experience was going into town and we would always have new shoes, socks, new dresses.  My mother had a, a younger sister and then some lady that would come and help her with the washing and ironing.  Once a week at least the lady would come and help her with us.  If she had to go some place the lady would watch us or one of my aunts, my Aunt Catherine.  So many times we would have perhaps two or three dresses hanging in the closet.  My sister would push the chair to the closet to get the dresses down for us.  I can remember this because my mom always had a large sheet with the dirty clothes tied up in that, in that sheet and then we had two wash tubs, two tin tubs on the side of the house near the well where they would do the washing with the rub board.  And I too have a rub board from my memories and I keep that because I'm so fond of the memories from my childhood and the people who helped my mom with us.  At age six my father passed but because my brothers and sisters who lived in the north, many of them had businesses or very good incomes, they would come south and bring things to us.  Also they would be sending box, boxes by the post office and they would always contain toys and clothing and maybe something you know that children would enjoy.  So I have very wonderful memories.  The store in Edgefield like a department store was owned by Mr. and Mrs. Turner.  One of them was related to my father.  I'm not sure which one.  But they all called him Uncle Milton and pardon me, and I think that my brother's first wagon when he was four was from this store.  He also had a BB gun.  He had holsters that little boys would wear with a belt and it had little pistols so they could play cowboys.  And we had a tricycle and my brother didn't like us to ride in his wagon so my sister and I would ride on this tricycle.  But if we pulled our brother in the wagon then he would let us take a turn with, with riding in the wagon.  I remember the house that had a swing, long front porch across the front and a swing and the pear tree.  And we would take turns pushing each other.  I just had a very happy childhood.

Speaker 1: We would go to my grandmother's.  My grandmother [Nora Belle Farrow McDaniel] would have us little girls threading the needles.  Her eyes were failing and my mom I guess thought well that will be a, a good job for little girls.  We would also cut little squares and triangles for the quilts to make the different designs that my mom and my grandmother, my Aunt Ozelle [Ozella McDaniel Willams] and Aunt Catherine would be working on.  In fact there was a job for everybody no matter what age.  At four and five I could feed the chickens.  I had a small bucket that they would put the chicken feed in and I was standing on the steps of my grandmother's kitchen and I would throw it out as far as I could throw it so the chickens could eat this feed.  Well, evidently I didn't do it fast enough and so the chickens would hop up on the steps and start pecking the food off of the steps.  And I was barefooted and so one day I just threw the bucket you know I thought here, take it, you know, leave my toes alone.  I was afraid they would peck at my toes.  We often went barefooted in the summer time and I can remember at the end of the summer I would say when the sweet potatoes were harvested, my grandfather [Will McDaniel] and my brother, he would always be doing a little shovel full of dirt also but they would make what we call the sweet potato bank.  And I love sweet potatoes.  I like them raw or cooked but generally I will eat like candied yams we call them now, sweet potatoes.  Okay, when I was a child we would wash them off and then we could just eat them raw if we wanted to or we could bake them.  My grandmother had a fire place and we could bake them in the hot ashes and coals in the fire.  Or she would put them in the oven of the wood stove.  It was a wood burning stove.  There was no electricity.  And my brothers, my uncles, my grandfather took care of bringing the wood from wherever they cut it to the wood yard and then cutting it in small pieces for the stove.  We children would bring it in to the kitchen.  We'd bring it in and put it in a wood box near the stove.
Story_ID: 15613
Speaker 1: So I just have very fond memories of my grandmother making quilts and things for us. My mom [Mary Eva McDaniel Strother], her favorite quilt I think was a crazy quilt.  We have some replicas of the crazy quilt.  The crazy quilt from my grandmother [Nora Belle Farrow McDaniel] is very precious because it was made like from maybe silk blouses or dresses from my great grandmother [Meliza Farrow].  She would sew for very wealthy white people, maybe the slave master, the overseer for their children or wives and so she could keep those scraps and make them into something very lovely.  Well, we called the crazy quilt the good spirit quilt because my grandmother was superstitious.  And she would have us sleep under this quilt.  We would say our prayers and we would always face the east where the sun rose.  We knew that was the east.  And we would not have any bad dreams or any visits from the Ku Klux Klan or night riders that would come to harm us.  She thought that the prayer, the 23rd Psalm, the Lord's Prayer and the evil spirits that would say normally come and maybe have, make you have nightmares or something, that would be kept away by the prayer and this crazy quilt.  So she would have everybody a crazy quilt.  It would be made out of scraps of clothes or feed sacks or whatever.  But the very fine fancy crazy quilt she would put on the foot of the bed or for company it was saved.  We didn't sleep under the silk or the velvet quilts, we just slept under the old I'll say utility type quilts.
Story_ID: 15614
Speaker 1: You've mentioned that there were other children in the family and I just want to make sure that we get their names on record too for your sister and your brother.  There were other children there in the household when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My brother Donovan Benjamin Alfred Nickerson Strom Thurmond John Strother was two years younger than me.  And I think because my father was in his late seventies he knew he wasn't gonna have anymore children so he included all the friends names in his name.  But the name he used was Donovan Benjamin which was the doctor's name, my father's nephew's name that delivered him.  I was delivered by a midwife as was my sister.  So we had, my sister Viola Geneva Strother Witcher (ph.) is her last name now.  And we have my sister in law who lives here in town, Benjamin's wife is Jane Strother.  But growing up there were the three of us and then later before my father passed my mom had a son, William Strother and he's deceased now.  His family lives in California so I visit my nieces and the sister in law from time to time.  Growing up my uncle's children lived close by.  One was named Belle, one was named Bunch.  We used a lot of nicknames.  I understand Bunch's real name is Ruth and she's still living in, in California.  But my grandmother had all these little grandchildren, the daughters she would teach to quilt and we all cut the little triangle and squares for quilts.
Story_ID: 15615
Speaker 1: You mentioned on several occasions that as a child you started early to thread the needles for your grandmother [Nora Bell Farrow McDaniel] because your mother thought that was a good job for little girls to do as your grandmother's eyesight began to fail.  So is that your official introduction to quilting, working with your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Well sleeping under the quilt was my official introduction.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we were always very warm and each one of us had our own quilt.  I guess grandmothers often made quilts for the grandchildren so that was my introduction.  And then we could take our quilt with us.  For example if we were in the car or if we were in the wagon, on the farm we could take our quilt to cover or to sit on or whatever.  My grandmother didn't like for the children--I'll say idle hands.  One of her favorite sayings was, "Idle hands are the devil's workshop."  And so she always either was knitting or crocheting or quilting and we learned to do this as I said by cutting the triangles and squares.  We had a cardboard template that we would draw the design or we would hold it and cut around or we would pin, stick you know like a couple of safety pins where she wanted us to cut.  Another thing we did before the quilt was made maybe with the feed sacks was to take the string out of the side of a feed sack and we have several I'll show you.  To preserve the string by winding it on a small piece of wood or a small piece of cardboard so that it could be reused.  The feed sack was then spread open and designs could be cut into the fabric or from that fabric.  She would boil often times the feed sack to get the letters off of it and I'll show you a feed sack pillow case because we would put lace or flowers, embroidered designs, sometimes maybe put your name on the pillow case or on whatever you made.  So if you had a piece of crayon you could write or draw a design and then iron it with a hot smoothing iron.  There was no electricity so the iron was heated on the cook stove in the kitchen and then you would have a heavy thick pad like a pot holder to carry the iron to where you were ironing, generally on a table.  They didn't have at my grandmother's, the ironing board with the legs that you have now that fold up.  My mom, my aunts did the laundry and then they had like four different smoothing irons so that one would be heating while you would be using one.  So my sister and I could do them at the same time.  Or while my mom was ironing we could use one of those hot irons.  Another thing that my grandmother would do, she would dye the fabric sometimes so we learned that Rit dye, it must be very old because they had it when I was a child and I'm seventy one.  So anyway--she would dye sometimes using red oak bark, sometimes she would use something called, oh it's a, a red berry.  I can't remember the name right now.  But we would paint our fingernails as children with this red berry juice so we would bring the branches with the berries and then pull them off, she would put them in a pot and then that would make a particular color dye.  If I think of it I'll tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't remember now.
Speaker 1: May I just ask--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --before we go any further if you could please mention once again this grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My grandmother Nora Bell Farrow McDaniel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Grandma Nora we called her was very good with the needle.  Some of her quilts are in our museum now in Atlanta, Georgia.  The Underground Shopping Center in Downtown Atlanta is where we have a quilt code museum and my daughter is the curator and she takes care of that part of it.  It's only been open for a month and we're having a grand opening on March 17th and 18th I believe it is, 2005.  So we're really excited and looking forward to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But grandmother had I would say maybe three quilts for each one of the beds that was used in the winter time.
Story_ID: 15616
Speaker 1: The house was heated with the same kind of wood that we would bring in for the kitchen stove.  There was a large stove in one of the bedrooms in the middle of the floor with a chimney that went up, a metal chimney.  And of course when the smoke went up the chimney would be warm and that would (unclear) also give some heat in that room.  The door would be kept open so that the heat could go from one room to the other.  It was a wood house, wooden frame house with a metal tin roof and of course lots of air holes.  I don't know about insulation.  I don't even know if they were using that when I was a child.  But sometimes similar to what I have by my door it's a, a long piece of fabric stuffed with cotton and sometimes sand to keep it in place would be placed by the doors or even around the bottom of the windows.  Our house had wooden covers for each window.  There was a hole in this wooden cover I'll say a small wooden door would be over the window.  It hooked inside with a metal hook and if I guess someone came that might harm us my grandmother had four or five sons usually at home that could help defend the house because there were Ku Klux Klan and I can only remember one time that there were some people riding in our yard at night up in the country.  This is in McCormick County.  It's about twenty miles from Greenwood and maybe fifteen miles from McCormick.  Pardon me.  The horses' hoofs hitting against the dirt was loud so we could hear that a lot of riders were coming.  And then my grandfather [Will McDaniel] said to his sons, "Get your guns," and then the guns could be aimed outside.  They just shot out in the air when they heard all of these horses coming.  And pretty soon we didn't hear the horse hoofs hitting against the dirt anymore so we think that they were discouraged and went away.  If they were friendly perhaps they would not have come so many people at one time.  My family was not expecting anybody I'll say probably near midnight.  I did not see anyone and I don't know that the older people in the family saw anyone but they thought it was someone that didn't mean us any good and so that's one reason they had the hole in the wooden doors that covered the windows.  Only one person I have heard of was drowned, a distant relative was drowned by the Ku Klux Klan.  I was a little girl and this particular cousin went fishing and he had been maybe in his twenties and he had fished in this creek many times and no harm came to him.  And then this particular date that he drowned they were looking for him for two days before his body floated somewhere that he was recognizable and was identified.  He was the husband of my nephew, Herbert Bussie's wife.  I don't know the man's name.  Right offhand I can't remember.  But I do know that this occurred in Edgefield.  But for the most part the people were you know very friendly with each other and helped each other in many ways.
Speaker 2: There is a question that we usually like to ask and basically wanting to know what are some of the sights, sounds and smells that remind you of growing up?  But you've described all of that, the sights, sweet potatoes and the house, the frame houses and the pillars and the marble steps and the sound of the rain on the tin roof and so I thank you for painting such a beautiful word picture of your childhood home.  But I'm wondering also the grandmother who made quilts, was she living in your childhood home as part of the extended family?
Speaker 1: Okay, no.
Speaker 2: Or did they have a different home site?
Speaker 1: Okay.  My mom and dad lived in Edgefield, South Carolina and my grandmother lived in McCormick County.  The little area was called Callison, C-A-L-L-I-S-O-N, South Carolina.  And whenever my grandmother would get mail it would be sent to Callison, South Carolina.  Pardon me.  The mailman traveled by I guess small truck to deliver the mail and it was Route, Route 1, Box 42, Callison, South Carolina.  That area is now called Troy, South Carolina so the name has changed but it was two separate spots and they were about twenty miles apart the houses were.  And sometimes we would go in the wagons from one location to another.  Sometimes we would go in my father's Studebaker.  My uncle in 1943 bought a red truck and so we would all pile in the truck sitting on quilts or pillows and go into town with my grandparents and my uncle.  The odors that I can really, really remember was the country ham and the country sausage.  Whenever you would stay at my grandmother's overnight you would have the odor of the seasoning from the sausage and country ham that was cured in the smoke house and was really preserved that way.  When I went to Nigeria, Africa I saw the mounds of dirt in the back of the house and I asked you know what that mound represented if someone was buried there.  And they said "Oh heavens no.  That's a yam bank.  There are sweet potatoes in there and they're preserved from the heat."  You know they wouldn't decay or rot in the heat or with the moisture even.  So this was a custom that my grandfather probably had gotten from his father or from other enslaved people.  My grandmother was an excellent cook and she would bake all kinds of delicious fruit pies.  We had cherry trees and apple, pear, peach.  They're still on the property now when we go there.  The well is still in the backyard and even though there's an electric pump where it comes into the house, there's indoor toileting now.  When I was a child my grandmother's outhouse had two seats, a large one and a small one.  So my sister and I could keep each other company when we went to this outhouse.  It was supplied with Sears and Roebuck and Montgomery Ward catalogs, newspapers, so it was a time that you could look at the pictures and we called it the wish book.  You could see what Sears and Roebuck or Montgomery Ward was selling.  Anyway, it was a fun time.
Story_ID: 15617
Speaker 1: My grandmother [Nora Bell Farrow McDaniel] in the evening or even when it was raining would not work out in the garden or in the field.  This is a time when the women could get together to quilt or in the winter. Neighbors would come.  They could bring a covered dish, pie or a cake or pot of stew or something and they would share that while making quilts.  This was when my grandmother would go over Bible verses.  We had to know our Bible verse for Sunday school.  Also she would have us repeat our numbers, the alphabet and spelling of the different names in the family.  We would sometimes be on the front porch but generally in the house in the evenings unless they would burn old rags in a bucket or a barrel to keep the mosquitoes away.  Then you could be outside doing whatever on your porch or under the tree.  But if you didn't have that say mosquito repellent I'll call the burning of the stinky rags, then you would have to be inside with the screen door to keep the mosquitoes away.  But that would be a time when the women could quilt.  In the winter when they couldn't work in the fields they could exchange patterns and visit and quilt.  My grandmother taught us the secret messages in the quilts on such an occasion as in the evenings or in the winter when they would be quilting.  She had a frame in her house that would be suspended from the ceiling.  It was -- there were hooks in the ceiling and the rope that would pull the frame up at night.  The, the frame would not be down where we would be walking or talking, eating or whatever.  Maybe it would say take two or three weeks, two or three months you know however long it took her to finish it.  I would say at least a month or more.  But she maybe would have two or three quilts going, some on her lap.  Maybe she would have some in a box that hadn't been finished and then the one that would be suspended from the ceiling.  So we always had something to do on the farm.  It might be shelling peas, it might be peeling fruit to put in a large pot to boil it, parboil it and can it.  She would also do sausage in jars to preserve that as well as hang it in cloth bags in the smoke house with the hams and sides of bacon which would really be pork, the pork meat.  They usually killed hogs say in the fall maybe around Thanksgiving when it was the coolest period and then this is a time when you would be needing quilts in the evening.  So if some needed repairing that's a time that you would do that.  But in teaching us the secret messages she told us, "Don't tell anyone.  Never talk about the secret quilt code."  And so even in the 70s [1970s], 80s [1980s] 90s [1990s] and now sometimes my friend will say, "Serena we didn't know you could do that." or "You never talked about quilting." or "You never mentioned it." and they'll say Howard, to my husband, "Can Serena really do that kind of work?"  And of course they you know will be able to see that I do quilt a little bit.
Speaker 2: Okay, well that's an interesting point because I understand now from what you told me about your grandmother that you learned to quilt early on.  But did that stay with you throughout your teen years and college and your career as an educator or did you come back to it at some later point in time?
Speaker 1: Well I did not quilt in my teen years.
Story_ID: 15618
Speaker 1: When my father [Milton John Strother] died I was around six years old.  I was sent to Philadelphia.  I went to school there until I was fifteen and my older--.
Speaker 2: Okay, what school is that please?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I went to St. Charles Borromeo Catholic School.  It was in South Philadelphia a block from my house on Christian Street.  We were at 2041 Christian Street.  So the sisters were my teachers, the nuns there and then at fifteen my older [half] brother came and brought all three of his daughters and they said, "Come to West Virginia.  You'll like West Virginia.  Come and visit us in West Virginia.  We always come see you.  You come see us."  So I wrote to my mom and said that my sister Sarah had let me go to West Virginia and that I would be there all summer.  Usually at some point in the summer, Easter vacation, spring break, Christmas, we would go to South Carolina and so I didn't know that I would go to South Carolina that summer.  However, once we got to West Virginia in about a month we did go to South Carolina to visit my mom [Mary Eva McDaniel Strother ] and my sister [Viola Strother] and my brother [Benjamin Strother] and we brought my sister and brother to West Virginia and there we were all, the young, three of us were united and then we finished high school together.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what high school did you graduate from?
Speaker 1: We attended Liberty High School [Williamson, West Virginia] and we still have reunions with those same people that I went to high school with.  Many of them live here in Columbus, Ohio.  Our reunions are well every two years so this year it's in Charleston, West Virginia.  It will be the first time that we did not meet in Williamson, West Virginia where I spent my teenage years.  Then I went to West Virginia State College where I met my husband [Howard Wilson].
Story_ID: 15619
Speaker 1: He [husband] is now Colonel Howard Wilson and we have three children, Maria Denise [Wilson Tate], Teresa Renee [Wilson Kemp] and Howard Anthony Wilson.  Both girls are married, one's last name, Denise Tate now and Teresa Kemp.  So we're just very proud of their needle work and they still you know do some type of needle work quilting or crocheting all the time.  My son is here in Columbus and of course we are together quite often either for dinner or to watch the games, the sports or something.  But we're in touch with him all the time too and his children.  I have a total of six grandchildren, two grandsons and the rest granddaughters.  And now we're so blessed that we have three great grandsons so I'm really bragging because we have a new one and his name is Jamel Kari (ph.) Thomas Joyce.  I think that's a long name to hang on a new baby so I'm going to call him Kari or Kahari, one or the other.
Story_ID: 15620
Speaker 1: You mentioned a little while ago that quilting provided opportunities for women to get together.  And you talked about your working with your grandmother [Nora Bell Farrow McDaniel], your sister [Viola Strother] being there as well helping to thread needles and to cut little shapes and triangles and other things.  But I'm wondering where were the men?  Where was your brother?  Where was your father, your grandfather?  Weren't they involved in the quilting?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no that was not that kind of work that they would do.  My father [Milton John Strother] was a very proud, older gentleman.  In fact I never saw him when he didn't have on a shirt and tie and a suit as if he was going to an office or a building even in his late seventies early eighties.  My grandfather [Will McDaniel] wore coveralls in the weekdays and a suit with shirt and tie on Sunday.  When the quilting was going on my grandfather often times would be caning chairs.  He would do the weaving of the cane in the bottom of chairs.  He also made brooms so my brother  [Benjamin Strother] and my uncles did this kind of work.  Many times he would be repairing shoes, putting the sole with some leather that they had there on the farm.  I don't know if it was tanned there or not but I do know that he had--oh I remember they ordered it.  They could order the leather pieces and then they could make whatever they wanted.  So he also would lace pieces of leather like for purses and wallets.  Many of the things that the men did the women did not do and vice versa.  My father would read like the Bible.  He would read the newspaper.  He would write letters.  He would write speeches.  I can't ever remember any type of manual work that he did.  He didn't kill hogs.  Someone else did that for him.  He didn't farm or grow anything he supervised it.  And I guess because of his lifestyle as a young man [the son of a large landowner and slaveholder], I don't ever recall him doing anything that we would call farm work.  I don't--he never even went out to feed the hogs or he never fed the chickens.  He, I would say that he was more of a scholarly person even in his senior years.  In his early eighties his mind began to fail and he had Alzheimer's when he passed.  He did die in Columbia, South Carolina and he died at the state hospital rather than at home like most other family members.  There was an elderly aunt, her name was Easter (ph.) Frazier.  And as a young girl, well she was born probably around 1840 something.  But as a young girl her children were reared and then at the age of three or four they were sold away.  When slavery ended she was married to George Frazier and we do have that documented in the census for Edgefield, South Carolina.  And Aunt Easter was in her nineties when I was a little girl.  And I can remember her sitting on the porch in good weather.  And then I remember that she didn't walk upright because of arthritis or some type of ailment.  My father, I don't recall having arthritis or any type of disability except that he got Alzheimer's.  He always walked and stood upright.  I have found out now that the disease of cancer is on both sides of my family and I too have cancer of the liver and I just recently had colon cancer.  Both my Aunt Ozella McDaniel [Williams] who gave our story to Raymond Dobard, the Howard University college professor, Jackie [Jacqueline] Tobin from University of Denver got our story from my Aunt Ozella--and Raymond Dobard is the only male quilter that I know right now.  Jackie doesn't quilt.  She said she's a writer and a college professor.  But most of the women I know in my family still quilt to some extent or mend or do some type of needle work.  Now my brother learned to cane chairs, to weave baskets.  However, when he was about I'll say ten or twelve he was running my grand mom's farm because my grandfather died and he stayed on the farm with other cousins and my grandmother until he was about twelve and a half to thirteen.  Then this is when we went to South Carolina and he came to West Virginia, attended high school and so forth.
Speaker 1: So the men are there, they're just not quilting?
Speaker 2: The men--that's right.
Speaker 1: They're good at other things.
Speaker 2: Yes, they're doing leather work.  My grandfather, my uncles and my brother hunted.  So they would go hunting and they would save the fur from the animals like rabbits were mostly trapped they weren't usually shot.  They had a lot of rabbit traps and so my brother would check the traps and bring the rabbits.  They would shoot like raccoons, possum, small deer, small animals that, that we would eat.  Also I ate turtle soup as a child and frog legs, just some very wonderful delicacies now that you can get in hotels.  Only when we were in Germany did we learn to eat escargot, the snails with the champagne sauce.  My children are very fond of that.  I'm not too fond of it but the snails in Europe were very small similar to the ones we have here in the United States.  When I went to Nigeria and also to Johannesburg, South Africa, I noticed that the snails were very large, maybe the size of your fist or larger.  And then they ate a lot of wild meat.  On the menu when I was in Johannesburg in the restaurant it said wild meat.  So I was wondering what is that?  And I asked them they said "Oh, well it's just very tasty.  The way we fix it, it's very tasty." Okay we flew to Ghana, West Africa and it was on the menu with rice and stews and just you know just sounding so delicious on the menu.  So we were going down the road in this air conditioned van and the driver stopped.  And he said , "Mrs. Wilson here is wild meat." And it was two giant muskrats being held on the side of the road by a young man who was selling these little animals.  And I said, "You sure?" He said, "Oh yes."  I said "Well it didn't look like that when it was on the table" -- brown, golden brown and with tomato sauce and a very unique recipe.  But anyway I was happy that I ate red snapper, shrimp and lobster while I was there as well as other kinds of fish and turkey.

Speaker 1: You mentioned a little earlier that you met and married Mr. [Howard] Wilson in West Virginia.  So can you tell me when that's happening and how you two meet and decide to get married?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can.  We met at West Virginia State College in 1952.  I'm from a family of educators and my nieces, the three nieces that was in the household where I lived in West Virginia, my older brother and sister in law's home was a very wonderful place to grow up because all the three daughters had gone to college at West Virginia State.  One was at Columbia University when I was at, in high school.  And when two of them, Margie Strother and Jean Strother was studying at West Virginia State they would come home on weekends and different occasions and take me back to West Virginia State for cultural events like concerts or homecoming football games, different things that--art shows, whatever was going on.  So I knew West Virginia State and sometimes I would ride with my older [half] brother whom I called "Father."  [Her own father had died when she was six and he was in his 80s; he had been married twice and had children and grandchildren born years before Serena.]  He was really a foster father to me and his wife Serena I was named for.  So their daughter was also named Serena and they always insisted that I do well in school.  And I'll have to tell you before I went to West Virginia State, French was taught at our high school [Liberty High School], and I did not want to take French.  I thought it was going to be very hard and I thought now I can get out of this by taking a shop class or something else.  And so I wrote a note to my older brother Fred Strother and the note said, "Dear Mr. Strother, Little Serena does not want to take French.  So she can transfer to the art or the shop class with your permission.  And I drew a line for my older brother to sign." So I thought this will certainly get me out of that class.  However, when he read the note he said "Well let's see.  The other Serena took French, Margie too French, Jean is taking French in college now."  I said,  "Well I'm never going to meet a Frenchman.  I'm never going to France so really it will be useless.  But I think I would like art or the shop class with the boys."  And so he said, "Well I'll tell you what, I'm going to be seeing the teacher this evening at church so I'll check with her."  I was shocked.  I said, "Oh never mind, never mind.  Give my note back."  And I tore my note up.  But later on I did do well in school and I did very well on the SAT and ACT tests and my sisters, these nieces whom I called sisters carried me to West Virginia State, helped with my schedule, told me which were the best teachers to avoid, the ones who would give the most homework and I was just stuck there really.  I thought that I could work in a restaurant or the hotel part [owned by Fred Strother] there in Williamson, West Virginia where I was and I really didn't need to go to college.
Story_ID: 15622
Speaker 1: I really didn't want to go to college.  I wanted to stay at the restaurant and the hotel.  My older brother Fred Strother booked dances.  Famous people like B.B. King or Ruth Brown or Billy Eckstein, just very famous black artists and so I enjoyed being at home so I thought I'm going to be too dumb.  I'll flunk out of college and I'll embarrass my family so I don't think I'll do it.  But not having any choice since they packed my clothes and said that I could not stay in Williamson [West Virginia], I was forced to register and be in college.  So my second day I was in a small restaurant we called the College Inn and my roommate, Ida Myree (ph.) introduced me to Howard Wilson.  He was a young cadet, sophomore student and just a very brilliant musician and mathematician.  So he extended his hand and said, "Oh nice to meet you but no I'm not looking for a wife."  And I said, "Well that's a strange thing to say.  I'm just meeting you for the first time.  Why would--do I look like I'm looking for a husband?"  And he said, "Well I just tell all the girls I meet that same thing."  And so we parted in the end and then the next day he invited me to go to the movie with him.  Well he was a big spender because the movie was twenty five cents per person and we had compulsory chapel seats that we had to sit in whenever there was anything going on in the auditorium.  So this particular evening that I went to the movies with him, I said, "I'll be sure not to propose to you on the way to the movie.", just maybe a half a block across campus from my dormitory to the auditorium where they showed the movies.  So from that I would hear him playing sometimes after class he would be practicing piano or perhaps the trombone or I would see him when he was marching with the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] band.  He was a young ROTC band director.  And there was a group at our campus called the Persian Rifles [drill team] and it was a precision military marching group composed of the ROTC students and Howard participated in that.  So I would see him often and he would wave or we would nod or I would see him in the cafeteria where we had our meals three times a day.  So we became very good friends and I majored in elementary education.  A lady, Zenobia Haley who I found out later was the stepmother to Alex Haley that wrote the book 'Roots.'  She was on our campus and her daughter Lois was a good friend of mine.  So we were in different sororities.  She's a Delta and I was a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.  So Miss Haley, Lois' mom was an advisor, graduate advisor to the Delta Sigma Theta sorority at one time on our campus so it was just a friendly community.  And even though Howard said that he was not looking for a wife when I met him, within two years he was proposing.  He was a graduating senior, a second lieutenant in the United States Army.  And before that when he had talked about marriage I said, "Well when you get a job and can keep me in pepperoni--." I loved to eat pepperoni and have pizza with pepperoni.  So upon his graduation and being commissioned as second lieutenant, he said, "I think I can buy some pepperoni and pizza." So then we did plan our marriage.  My family was not particularly in favor of me marrying my senior year in college.  In fact my mom so disapproved that she did not come to the wedding and I was really wondering if my "father" [half-brother Fred Strother] was going to come until the last minute.  The morning of the wedding he came.  But because I was well known on the campus as a respectable young lady and a good student, President Wallace, the president of our college said that he was coming to my wedding and he had responded, he and his wife and that if my father was unable to travel the three hours from Williamson [West Virginia] that he would give me away.  And so in his best blue suit I'm sure, my father showed up.
Speaker 2: So now this is your older brother?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now the surrogate father?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Fred Strother ran the restaurant.  He had a bar and a pool room.  So he probably worked the night shift and then drove the three hours early in the morning to arrive in Dunbar, West Virginia at 11:00 a.m. for the wedding.  And of course my sorority sisters, the Alpha Kappa Alpha women from that campus, the Persian Rifles [Drill Team], the military fraternity that my husband belonged to and the men of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity were all present at my wedding.  We had just a very warm friendly relationship with all of those people.  And we still communicate phone, letter and travel with many of these same people that I went to college and high school with.  We married, had three children.  We were first stationed in Oklahoma.  I have one son [Howard Anthony Wilson] born there.  Then we were stationed in Germany.  My daughter Teresa [Wilson Kemp] was born there and my daughter Denise [Wilson Tate] was born in West Virginia.  And we jokingly say good thing we didn't go many other places because I would have a child from each one of those, those places.  But we do enjoy traveling still.  We're rearing a great grandchild.  Jasmine is eight years old.  Her mom is deceased so we took her in August to Hawaii for a nice vacation.  So we are trying to pass our legacy, our history on to her.  Whenever we do programs we travel with Jasmine.  For example, the University of Southern Illinois in Carbondale, Jasmine went with us.  And whenever there was a shortage of tour guides through the museum exhibit then Jasmine could fill in 'cause she knows our history very well.
Story_ID: 15623
Speaker 1: You've described again a wonderful life, most of it spent in the Southern States of the United States and now in Europe in Germany.  But I'm wondering, how did you get to Ohio since we're here in Columbus today?
Speaker 2: (Laughing.) Okay.  We came to Columbus, Ohio many times to visit my husband's [Howard Wilson] family who lives here.  He had two aunts and uncles, a host of cousins and relatives here.  But my brother [Benjamin Strother] and sister [Viola Strother Thomas Witcher (ph.)] also moved to Ohio for work.  West Virginia did not offer the kind of work that young African Americans could earn a living with.  Mostly, perhaps you could be a clerk in a store, own your own business, maybe work on the railroad or the coal mines, work in the mines or something related to the coal mining business.  But my brother was stationed in Germany one time while we were there.  Benjamin came to visit us when we were stationed in Baumholder and stayed a while with us.  Then he after three or four years got out of the army and not finding work in West Virginia in Williamson he came to Columbus, Ohio and was able to work for Westinghouse.  It was manufacturing refrigerators and other appliances at that time.  And my sister was already here with her husband who was working for the transportation department.  Clyde Thomas was her husband at that time.  And I often tease my sister because she's with her third husband and Viola had a job working for Westinghouse also.  So one summer I came while I was in college.  Howard and I came on the bus and stayed with her for a couple of days during the Easter spring break and so she knew him, the love of my life.  And then later when I married him she was not surprised.  But we, we liked Ohio.  I always came when it was good weather and so probably had I come when it was icy or snowing, maybe I would not have settled here.
Story_ID: 15624
Speaker 1: When we were stationed in Germany and [husband] Howard [Wilson] got orders for Vietnam, because so many of our friends and acquaintances had been killed or injured, we decided that I would stay near family and he wanted to build a house so that we would have our own home rather than be on the military base.  So this time we chose Columbus, Ohio because both of us had family here.  My children had never spent a night like normal African American children with cousins overnight or rode bikes say to the store or through the neighborhood with their cousins.  My brother had two children, Karen and Stewart Strother and my sister had one daughter, Sharon Thomas.  So we decided that we would come and look for property here.  We first looked in the newspaper and decided that we would call some of the real estate agents that were describing property listed in the classified section.  Upon talking to one real estate agent who described a house with four bedrooms, three bathes, two-car garage and hearing that they couldn't rent or sell or lease to African Americans--at the time we were "Negroes"--so we decided that we would build a house.  One gentleman that my sister knew, Mr. Paul Turner was a real estate developer and he told us about this small neighborhood off of Sunbury Road.  When we came we saw St. Mary's of the Springs College was close by.  There was an elementary school close by.  It was not too far from a church that his family attended.  It was close to a grocery store and thinking I could live anywhere there was a church, a school and a grocery store I knew I would be happy while he was away.  So we bought the property and then talked to a real estate agent, Mr. Paul Turner, about builders and he recommended Mario Pachetti (ph.).  So when then selected some plans and I kind of supervised the building of the house while Howard was in Vietnam.  We prayed a lot.  We wrote letters and I went back and forth to West Virginia to visit his family and my family.  And of course the year ended.  We were so thankful that he was returned to us and we had no knowledge while he was in Vietnam that he was shot down twice.  His helicopter was shot down and he called in the artillery fire on his position.  However, I think due to all the praying of his mother, Louise Wilson and his grandmother Irene Jefferson, he was saved and he came home without any wounds or disabilities.  So we're just very happy to be in Columbus, Ohio now in our retirement years.
Story_ID: 15625
Speaker 1: We came to Columbus in 1967, selected the property and then he [husband Howard Wilson] was in Vietnam in 1968 when the house was completed.  Because Howard was I think old-fashioned he really didn't want me to work while he was away cause he thought someone should be with the children [Maria Denise Wilson Tate, Teresa Renee Wilson Kemp, Howard Anthony Wilson], one of us all the time.  And as the children were now all school age I decided that I would seek employment.  So I first went to the Franklin County Children's Services.  I had a minor in sociology and I thought well I could probably work with families on the army base.  I had worked for the Red Cross and done some social work.  Many Army wives volunteer and help other families in that way.  So I thought well I'll do that.  But hearing that it was an eight to five job, it wasn't too good for me because my kids would be out of school at 3:30 or 4:00 [P.M.]  So then I went to put my name on the teaching substitute list at Columbus Public Schools.  Columbus Public Schools at that time had a list of vacancies.  And even though people had told me that I would not be hired in the City of Columbus because they were not hiring Negro teachers, I did find employment and I was very happy to be working near my home at Brentnell Elementary.  This was September now of 1968.  The children and I remained here for two or three years while Howard returned and was stationed as Commander of the National Guard for the State of Kentucky.  We would visit him and he would visit us on weekends and holidays.  And then we did not move from Columbus again until he was ordered to Germany and at that time we went to Heidelberg where he was--I've forgotten, I'll have to ask him what his position was.
Speaker 2: (Howard Wilson): I was inspector general.
Speaker 1: Howard was inspector general for the Berlin Brigade and also in Heidelberg, Germany in the early 70s [1970s].  I got a job teaching at an elementary school called Mark Twain while he was at work everyday and of course the kids and I had the same schedule and it just worked very fine for both of us.
Speaker 2: And how long were you in Germany?  Well we spent a total of nine years in Germany.  But we were there like three years at a time then we would rotate back to the States.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are your children bilingual--because of that?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  Yes.
Story_ID: 15626
Speaker 1: [Daughters] Denise [Wilson] speaks Spanish and Teresa [Wilson] French and German.  They all speak German, my son Anthony [Wilson] also.  So wherever we would travel somebody would be able to order the food from the menu.  The French I had in high school was not the same dialect or the same sounding French that they were speaking when we would go to Paris every year.  Howard would always take us Memorial weekend to Paris when we were stationed in Germany.  That's a time when the American USO [United Service Organizations] had so many different benefits for Army families so you can get very inexpensive hotels.  For example, a weekend in Paris would be thirty five dollars with hotel and meals.  So we thought that was reasonable.  We could afford that.  On the captain, lieutenant or major or colonel's salary 'cause we were there when he was in different ranks.
Story_ID: 15627
Speaker 1: I'm really curious now about when you had time to quilt or are you quilting while you're teaching and raising children and traveling the world.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Are you quilting yet?
Speaker 2: I was not quilting to any great extent.  I made clothes.  I had a lot of scraps.  When my husband [Harold Wilson] was a second lieutenant, he made about two hundred and twenty nine dollars and twenty five cents a month.  And so the cost of living was very low at that time but still cars, trips, food, shelter all you know was costly and so I learned to sew to make clothes for myself and my daughters [Teresa Wilson and Denese Wilson].  I really never learned to make boy clothes or men's clothing but I can alter and repair clothes.  And so whenever I would make something for the girls or myself I would save the scraps and my aunt [Ozella McDaniel Williams] or my mom [Mary Eva McDaniel Strother] would say, "Let's quilt," when they would come to visit, then would be the only time that I would actually do any quilting.  We were in Heidelberg when my Aunt Ozella came and of course she was still quilting in her senior years.  And she, my mom had passed in 1972 while we were in Heidelberg so when my Aunt Ozella came to visit she said, "Don't you have some scraps?  Let's get busy." 'Cause she was there for a month.  So we did do tours to England and to Holland, to Belgium, to Paris but we also in the evenings would have time for needle work and we would sit and talk and visit.  So she started me to quilting again and also she reminded me of the secret messages in the quilt patterns.  So she would have me to say the quilt code like my grandmother [Nora Bell Farrow McDaniel] had taught us when I was a child.  Then when I came back to the United States my sister said why don't we work on a quilt and I said well let's go and take a refresher course, so we did.  We took an evening class up on High Street at a place called the Golden Thimble or something like that and we were together twice a week for three hours in the evening for about six weeks.  We enjoyed it so much.  So then this kind of rekindled our interest.  I opened a quilt shop out on East Livingston.  My Aunt Ozella who was retired now from the Los Angeles School System as principal had moved back to Charleston, South Carolina so she was quilting I'll say back home in South Carolina.
Story_ID: 15628
Speaker 1: At the end of the last segment you started to tell me about the quilt shop that you opened and that's in the 1980s?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell me about the inspiration for opening that?
Speaker 2: In the 1980s, my Aunt Ozella [McDaniel Willams] had retired.  Only two aunts of the five aunts were living, Aunt Katherine [McDaniel] in Los Angeles and Ozella in Charleston, South Carolina.  So she would always say, "Serena you're sewing and you're just being wasteful throwing away the scraps."  And whenever I would go to Charleston she would say, "Come, let's work on this quilt," you know.  I'd say, "No I want to go sightseeing, I want to go fishing or shrimping or something."  And she would say, "No, let's do this first and then we'll go."  So from the beautiful quilts of course that she was making and selling in the open market some people call the old slave market in Charleston, South Carolina, I decided that I would open a quilt shop because I had a collection of maybe fifty quilts.  And some were family quilts and at the time I was actually selling old family quilts.  Well, now I'm down to a few probably twenty five or thirty family quilts so we've placed those in a museum.  But when I first started I was selling quilts that we made, my sister, my aunt, my mom, my grandma or myself and we had the shop [Plantation Quilts and Gifts] on Livingston Avenue, the 3600 block of Columbus, of Livingston in Columbus, Ohio.  So now I was still working and the place would only be open on the weekend.  But because of my love of travel and vacationing I really wasn't there enough to make it profitable so the money that I was making I was paying out a lot of it because I wanted to be away on the weekend or in church or at different family functions.  So we closed the shop down after about six years and we now have our quilts at Peddler's Village Antique Mall here in Columbus, Ohio.  Really it's in Upper Arlington at Reed and Henderson.  So this June [2005] I will terminate my contract with Peddler's Village and put all of our quilts in Atlanta, Georgia in our museum for display or for the gift ship that my daughter Teresa [Wilson] Kemp has there.  So I get requests from time to time for quilts so I usually direct the people to Peddler's Village Antique Mall in Upper Arlington.  I think that just the fact that I've been around quilts all my life, I've always slept under them.  Even though I have an electric blanket on the bed to warm it up first I still like quilts.  I have recently made some sampler quilts with the secret quilt code for my grandchildren and I will be making one for the new great grandbaby that my granddaughter Tonisha Thomas has.  So it just seemed like the natural thing to do.  Long ago when we didn't have a lot of store-bought gifts, didn't have the money to really buy gifts for family, we made quilts for special occasions, birthdays, graduations, weddings and many times these items have been handed down in families with the name of the quilter and the date and sometimes the occasion that it was given.  So I just think that I should keep this legacy going and we have given just very recently a quilt to my grandson and his new wife in February 2005.  He's in Charleston, South Carolina and he's around cousins and many of our Gullah Geechee relatives.  That's my heritage.  And from time to time I visit and exchange quilts with family members.  We exchange patterns, sometimes pieces of fabric that we like, just as my grandmother and my mother and aunts did long ago.
Story_ID: 15629
Speaker 1: I really should tell you about my great grandmother, Meliza Farrow who was the midwife who traveled with the sampler quilt when she would go to deliver babies or to take medicine.  And she, they called it "waiting on."  She wasn't "nursing," it was called--she went to "wait on" a sick person.  And many times the story has been related to me that she would wake up in the night and say, "Get the wagon ready or saddle the horse, someone is low sick."  Now if you're a low sick that's very ill.  And then before she would even get in the wagon to go to that person's house someone might come on horseback or in a buggy or wagon saying "Come at once, Cousin So-and-So is very sick or low sick."  So it was almost like she had mental telepathy or maybe she would dream it, I don't know.  But I just know that my grandmother said that this is what happened.  There was no telephone, no telegram but many times she would know something before it would occur.  My grandmother and my mom had that same I'll say mental telepathy.  And an example of that, my mom would sometimes even though she was very superstitious, say for example if your hand itched she thought you were going to get a letter.  If your foot itched, she would say "Oh you're going to walk over new ground." Now these superstitions have been handed down from my African ancestors so when [husband] Howard [Wilson] and I sponsored three girls from Nigeria here at the university, I asked them about some of these superstitions.  And they said oh yes we have all of those back home.  And also the one girl Chicozi Obeka (ph.) said that her grandmother would tell her, "If you want to catch a bird, get some salt, put it in your hand and put a pinch of it on the bird's tail."  And she said all the little children would be trying to use this method to catch a bird.  But she said that her grandmother would hear a dog howling and she would say, "Someone is going to die."  And I said "Oh that's here too."  We have that same superstition."  Then if an owl is hooting going hoo, hoo nearby, that's a sign that, Chi-chi said was a sign of death.
Story_ID: 15630
Speaker 1: I know that the quilts of Harriet Powers, an African American slave woman have a lot of symbolism that a lot of historians say it's similar to I guess we have to say textile art--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --from West Africa.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you see that same kind, do you see that kind of connection to the African continent when you study quilts and teach about them?
Speaker 2: I know positively that the quilt patterns that are in our quilt code are called Amish quilts, Quaker quilts, European American quilts. However, the artists and the quilters in Africa have never met these people and some of these patterns go back to the Egyptian pyramids.  For example the windmill pattern is from Ghana, West Africa.  In--while growing up in America I always thought that the windmill was related to Holland or to the New England states where they had the windmills only to go to Ghana last year and seen that it has been an Ashanti symbol since the 12th century.  So in our quilt code most of the patterns are from Africa, even the fan quilt is from the Tuareg people.  The men on horseback or camels wear a fan shaped design on their heads and a mask over their face to keep the sand out of their nostrils and eyes and so forth.  And this particular fan was put in the quilt code because the Africans could relate to it.  The circle on our quilt we call the wagon wheel pattern really to the Africans meant God is everywhere.  He's always present.  And so we know the African meanings for the patterns in our quilts.  Only probably the bear paw print would not have any African significance.  And one reason because they don't have bears in tropical Africa.  But we understand from traveling to Africa, from studying African literature, from talking to Africans from many different countries that these patterns came in the memories of my ancestors and many other African American ancestors.  Also, when I hear people say this is a European or American pattern you know I don't argue.  Or when people say they don't believe in the Underground Railroad quilt code or the secret messages, that there's no way we could have gotten to Cleveland or Sandusky or even to Canada with this secret code, I just think that often times everybody will not believe the same thing.  Like people don't believe that John Glenn went to the moon or that there was a Holocaust for the Jewish people in Europe.  I just know a little bit more about the Holocaust that African Americans experienced being African American than I do about the Holocaust in Europe.  But having lived there nine years and gone to the different locations where extermination took place and then visiting in Jerusalem the holocaust museum, I know that this is not a myth and that no one made that up.  And besides when I go back to the secret messages in the quilts the overseer and the plantation owner did not know the meaning of these quilt patterns.  They were handed from one slave to another slave by the plantation grape vine.  My grandmother sang 'Swing Low Sweet Chariot', 'Wade in the Water', 'Steal Away', all of those old songs that gave messages to the slaves.  They would know when Harriett Tubman  was approaching the plantation for example.  In a book I read she said that she would sing the song that was being sung and as soon as it ended she would begin her song, "Swing low sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home," so that the slaves would know that there was a new person coming to take them to freedom, that when they sang about crossing over Jordan, it was the Ohio River, not going someplace else or going back home to Africa.  Then I read many accounts where slaves said there were Africans who could fly away and then the song, "I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away," they were stealing away with the Underground Railroad.  They weren't actually getting wings to fly any place.  So there's much in the folklore that sounds say like legends that were related in fact to factual happenings.
Speaker 1: Well Mrs. Wilson you've told us about these scraps of fabric that come together to make beautiful quilts and scraps of song with the spirituals that tell other kinds of stories about escape to freedom.  And I just wonder here at the beginning of the 21st century, African American culture, quilting and the slave spirituals, they're all big business now.  Are you surprised that so many people now have come to appreciate the slave culture and that now the quilts are hanging on museum walls?  Are you surprised by any of that?
Speaker 2: Well my favorite quilter would probably be Aminah Robinson from Columbus or maybe Carolyn Mazloomi from Cincinnati or Faith Reingold.  And locally Mrs. Mildred Washington is a wonderful quilter and she and I often do school programs and teach children at some of the local junior high and high schools to quilt.  So I just can appreciate that I'm not the only one that's involved in quilting or appreciate hand craft.  I like handmade things and this is why I like this African dress for example.  It's made in Nigeria and it's a handmade dress.  So everyday I wear something to remind me of my ancestor and to show my appreciation for I guess the legacy that, that they left and for the history that I've learned about our people.  But I think it's big business because old things become new.  It's just like fashion, something that you had in your closet a long time ago you thought you would never wear, you were getting ready to give away maybe to the kidney foundation or the goodwill and then here designers are showing it again as new.  And so I think probably this will be a lasting historical event in our culture because so many people are teaching their children and getting out old quilts and maybe putting them on top of the electric blankets.  Because my sister [Viola Strother Witcher] and I said we would never make quilts when we grew up.  We said that we would get us a blanket out of Sears and Roebuck.  At the time electricity was not on our farm when we were saying that.  We just didn't want to stick our fingers and make quilts and cut little triangles and squares.  But now I realize cutting those triangles and squares was a kindergarten, kindergarten activity and that it was helping our coordination.  My grandmother [Nora Bell Farrow McDaniel] making us learn the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule was training for a lifetime that at that time we just didn't appreciate.  But now I have a great appreciation for my grandmother and for all the knowledge that she and my mother and my Aunt Ozella [McDaniel Williams] gave us.
Story_ID: 15631
Speaker 1: I'm wondering why you wanted to share your story with The HistoryMakers?
Speaker 2: Well one reason, a lady called me a couple of years ago and she said she was from Newark, Ohio and that she was going to be in Columbus and she was just thinking about talking to different people who had some type of perspective that might be of historical significance.  And so I thought, "Well she doesn't want to talk to me because I don't know anything important to tell."  However, I've come to think that I should share my story about the quilts and about our family that others can benefit perhaps from the life that we have lived and how we have followed the Golden Rule and just the things that I'll say is a part of the American dream.  Many people dream dreams but actually don't get to carry them out.  And I have enjoyed the life that I've lived, I am still enjoying it and I think that it's nice to share with others some positive aspect of American life and of being a black person living in America in the 20th and then the 21st century.  So I often say that if I should get hit by a car or croak tomorrow that I have enjoyed the life and that I think that young people could practice the Golden Rule more and learn from seniors like myself.

Speaker 1: What do you hope your legacy will be to your six day old great grandson and to the children of his generation?
Speaker 2: Well probably just to be good Americans, to be good citizens, as I'll say again, practice the Golden Rule, to live in peace and harmony and then to learn all they can about their history, African history as well as American history, European history, but to learn how to get along with all people and to enjoy the world that they can become a part of.  And I, I have to say something about be sure, I want to be sure that my children, my grandchildren and great grandchildren know that we are praying for them to be successful in whatever professions or careers just as my elderly relatives prayed for me and my husband's family they were Christians or they are Christians and they too live a very rich life and leave a good legacy.

Speaker 1: And my last question is, is there anything that I've left out that you would like to add at this point?
Speaker 2: Well I think it's a great work that The HistoryMakers are doing to record similarly to record American history and to do it in the lifetime of the people that are living it more than waiting until we're dead and then finding out what happened in bits and pieces.  So I'm happy that Frederick Douglass could read and write and that he left something for us and William Still left something for us to read.  So I have enjoyed you visit and hope that you will continue for many years to do this kind of work.
