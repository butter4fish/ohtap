Speaker 1: This was taken in about 1975.  It's at my parents' house.  I'm sitting on the couch in the middle, and my mother is to my left, to your right.  Maybe it might have been earlier than that, looking at the length of that skirt.  That was short-skirt period, so maybe it was like '73' [1973].
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: This was taken about 1983, '84' [1984], again at my parents' house on Long Island.  That's my sister in the chair.  I'm on the floor with two of my little cousins.
Speaker 2: What is her name?
Speaker 1: Charlene;
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is at the house of a dear--dear friends.  I really consider them family, you know, extended family--Sonny and Joyce Mitchell out, on Long Island.  It was taken approximately 1975.  It was a Christmas Eve.
Speaker 2: Okay, and that?  (unclear).
Speaker 1: I was about, ooh, probably two.  It's in my grandmother's backyard out in Rockville Centre, so that would have been 1946, '47' [1947];
Speaker 2: (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yes.  This is one of my favorite photos.  It's taken in Jamaica in 1983, '84' [1984], I'm not quite sure of the date, on the north coast of Jamaica in a little cottage that I have.
Speaker 2: Is Ochoa Rios in that area?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, on the north coast.  It is, outside (unclear); I think this--because it was in the eighties, I have no--I would say maybe more like '86' [1986], '87' [1987].  Again, it was a friend's house or something;
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was taken in the nineties--1991 probably, again, in a friend's backyard with my mom sitting in the chair.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Again, this was taken in the nineties, probably about 1996.  No, more like 1997.  That's my mom, and again, one of my extended family--great aunts. What's your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Ethel.
Speaker 1: And your aunt?
Speaker 2: This aunt here?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Juanita Wiley; I'm guessing from here that this was again in the 1990's, again, with one of the many little people in the family;
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: This was taken in the 1980's, and I have no clue where we were.  It's one of my nieces, Debra Mitchell.  I don't remember the guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is in the 1990's.  This is during a period when I was on the National Board of Planned Parenthood Federation, and I'd gone to do a speech out in, I guess it was Arizona.  That's the--Lillian Tamayo is the CEO of the affiliate there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And (unclear)
Speaker 2: This is Marcia, circa 19--probably 1950, '51' [1951].  I was about six or seven years old.
Speaker 1: And where was that?
Speaker 2: Out on Long Island in Rockville Centre.  That's where I grew up. Okay.
Speaker 1: This one's a hoot.  This is my first trip to Europe.  And my sister went with me, and we took a cruise through the Mediterrean.  And I got crowned Miss Estres (ph).  So, that would have been 1969;
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is at one of the great birthday celebrations for Maya that Oprah hosted in 2008.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: One of my niece's wedding--Kim Mitchell, who married this man, Don Jasmin.  It was 1995.  They're divorced now, so we don't care about the date (laughter); I must have been about 13 or 14 in this shot.  It's me with a number of my cousins.  My sister is to my far right.  My cousin Bill, who was on my father's side...  my cousin Donnie and Jackie who are brother and sister who are to my left, who are on my mother's side.  I'm the youngest on both sides of the family;
Speaker 2: (background talk).
Speaker 1: This is probably one of the last ones of my mother and I.  It was taken in I think, 2000.  My mom died-
Speaker 2: And that was taken when?
Speaker 1: It was taken in 1999, I think.  My mom passed in 2001.  And it was at an event.  I don't know what the event was.  I wish I did, because Susan Taylor took that photo.  So-
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know where we were.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Sweet Sue.  This is just a collection of photos that I call them--I have a lot of adopted nieces.  And you're looking at two of them here, who were down at the Essence Music Festival in 2011.  And I was moderating a panel on "The State of Black Women in America."
Speaker 2: Are you related to any Gillespie's in Kentucky or Ohio?
Speaker 1: I could be.  You know, it's funny.  One of my cousins was supposedly doing the family tree.  I kept saying to her, "So, where is it?  Where is it?  Where is it?"  You know, so I always say that.  You know, because the name is fairly unusual, there's probably a connection.  And it was a big family.  I mean, I know I'm related to Dizzy.
Speaker 2: (unintelligible background talk).
Speaker 1: That's alright.  It was in the late nineties.  And it was an event that was honoring--I don't remember--maybe Aunt Fanny, the woman with the fabulous hat, to the left--because she was there with her aide, Gladys.  And I don't know who that woman is.  She was getting a citation from Nassau County.  It was at some women's event, and I spoke.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--Angie Brook-
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Oh, she's Canadian.
Speaker 2: Oh, she's Canadian, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.

Speaker 1: All right.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in New York City, in Harlem, at the Firehouse, which is a theatre that's produced by George Faison.
Story_ID: 57634
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Seafood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oysters, (laughter) oysters.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I love the fall.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: It's a toss-up, Jamaica and Paris [France].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  "Shit happens."  (laughter).
Story_ID: 57635
Speaker 1: All right.  So, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side and your father's side separately, and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please? Certainly.  Ethel, E-T-H-E-L, May Gillespie.
Speaker 2: Is that M-A-E?
Speaker 1: M-A-Y.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Do you want her maiden name, or-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It would be Young, Y-O-U-N-G, Gillespie, G-I-double L, E-S-P-I-E.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: She was born May 8, 1914, Rockville Centre, Long Island, New York.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace your mother's side, and what were they doing?
Speaker 1: I can trace my mother's side at this point back to sometime in the 1840's, 1830's, in that I know that my great-mother, a woman named Lividia Risen, was born and was a slave on a farm in Virginia.
Speaker 2: Can you spell her last name for us?
Speaker 1: My great-grandmother's last name was R-I-S-E-N.  And then she married a man whose last name was Temple.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, she was--go ahead with her story.  I didn't intend to...
Speaker 1: I have two photographs of her.  But the earliest one I know was taken--which was probably in her late twenties.  We know that her first three children were born when she was in slavery.  And then she married the man who was my great-grandfather, and had the rest of her children.  I know that she worked, you know, the land.  My great-grandfather was German.  She, you know, raised the children.  She had seventeen children.  My grandmother was her youngest.  My great-grandfather died when my grandmother was basically a baby.
Speaker 2: Did you know his name?
Speaker 1: I know that his name was Temple.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: His last name was Temple, but I cannot tell you his first name.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my great-grandmother brought the family up to work a farm in New Jersey, which is where my great, where my grandmother grew up.  My great-grandmother and...  Do you want me to continue?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Did you tell us what part of New Jersey?  I'm-
Speaker 1: Long Branch.
Speaker 2: Okay, Long Branch, New Jersey, okay.
Speaker 1: Long Branch, L-O-N-G.
Speaker 2: Long Branch, okay.  Now, is there a significance to the Long Branch community in New Jersey, in terms of--?
Speaker 1: I think at the time there was a black community there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I've read about it.
Speaker 1: But, you know, that's exactly where, you know, she worked the land until she died, and raised the children.  I know that, you know, one of my great uncles was a prize fighter, and a relatively successful one.
Speaker 2: Well, what was his, do you know his name?
Speaker 1: Larry, Larry Temple.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he was the one who first came out to, he settled on Long Island [New York].  And he settled in a town called Rockville Centre [New York], after his career was over.  And he--
Speaker 2: He was fighting then, and-
Speaker 1: He was a contemporary of Jack Johnson's.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is the first part of the century.
Speaker 1: Yes.  In fact, I've seen, you know, I did find a flyer with his name on it.  And according to family lore, Jack Johnson dodged fighting him.  He chased Jack Johnson all around Europe, supposedly trying to get a fight.
Speaker 2: But, you know, that's the family lore.  True?  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, that's a good story, yeah.  Okay.  So, he fought heavyweight; he was a big guy.
Speaker 2: Big man.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, the family--he's the one that really centered the family in Rockville Centre [New York], right?
Story_ID: 57636
Speaker 1: Yes.  And then my grandmother, when she was sixteen, left the farm and came to Rockville Centre [New York] to work as a domestic worker.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because, again, there was family there. And that would have been 1900.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then she met my grandfather, whose name was Charles Young.  Because he was, worked as a bank messenger in Rockville Centre [New York], and they got married.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, these are your mother's parents?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  I know very little about my grandfather.  My maternal grandfather, we know is from Maryland, but he apparently didn't want to talk much about his family or his childhood.  He died in the flu epidemic in 1918, when my mother was four.
Speaker 2: Now, Public Television had a whole special about the flu epidemic in 1918.
Speaker 1: Yes...
Speaker 2: It was a national disaster.
Speaker 1: 'Bring Me Your Dead,' yes.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, you know, my grandmother raised--she had four children.  My mother was her youngest.  She raised them all in Rockville Centre [New York] in the house that my grandfather had bought for her.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There was a small black community there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, what did you learn about how your mother grew up?  I mean, what did she say about growing up in Rockville Centre [New York]?  What was it like?
Speaker 1: Well, considering my grandmother was still in Rockville Centre [New York], you know, at that time when I was born in the house that my mother grew up in--and we lived at, almost at the other end of the block, in the house that I grew up in--what she talked about was, you know, it was hard times.  My grandmother, you know, took in laundry.  And my mother was an extraordinary cook, and also ran a catering business, you know, when I was growing up.  She talked about learning to cook when, you know, she was like six, seven years old, because that's what she had to do to help out with the family, because Nana was working, her oldest sisters were working.  You know, everybody had to work.  The black community in Rockville Centre was small, working-class.  You know, it was like in a small little section of the town.  Long Island [New York] is one of the most segregated areas in this country.  It certainly was then.  But a lot of the towns there would be, you know, one little corner, would be where blacks lived.  And where we lived was, originally had been like Italians and blacks.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it became an all-black area.  Basically, you know, like one main drag--a little, a few side streets.  It was kind of--I always called it--it's like growing up, up South.  Most of the black people had, were from the South.  The black population grew in the twenties and in the thirties, because people were migrating north.  My father's people came up in the thirties from North Carolina.
Story_ID: 57637
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we get to your father's-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --side, now did your mother--now, what did she end up doing for a living?  Did she have a chance to finish school, or anything?
Speaker 2: Yes, she finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The local high school, South Side High School in Rockville Centre [New York].  And she actually went to secretarial school and worked for a while as a secretary in Queens [New York], I think someplace in Queens she had a job.  But she really didn't like commuting.  And so, she ended up--you know, she couldn't get a job as a secretary in Long Island [New York], and so she went and did domestic work.
Speaker 1: Was she the only one of her siblings to--or were there other of her siblings that-
Speaker 2: Her two sisters, her oldest sisters, also finished high school.  My uncle lost his hearing and most of his sight as a child, and then as a young man.  So, he was never really able to work or finish school.  But yes, my aunts all graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, your mother basically worked in Long Island [New York].  Was the black population basically employed as a service--?
Speaker 2: It was a service, primarily-
Speaker 1: --for well-to-do white people and--?
Speaker 2: Yes, primarily a service population, which was true for a lot of these you know, areas on Long Island.  And that only changed--really, I think the big change came with the war.
Story_ID: 57638
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, well, let me go to your father's side, and I'm going to try to get them together.  So, can you give us your father's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Charles, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Marshall, M-A-R-S-H-A-L-L, Gillespie, G-I, double L, E-S-P-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born November, 1910.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Outside of Laurenberg, North Carolina in a place called Johns Station [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Now, Laurenberg [North Carolina], is that L-O...
Speaker 2: L-A-U-R-E-N-B-E-R-G.
Speaker 1: And the place is called?
Speaker 2: Johns Station [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Not as much.  I know that the family originated in South Carolina.  I know that my great-grandfather and one of his brothers came into North Carolina, into the Laurenberg area, really to farm.  I know that, you know, my great-grandparents--my great-father, was a sharecropper in this place I call Johns Station [North Carolina].  I've actually seen the land, and with the remnants of what had been the family cemetery there.  I know that we're related in some way to Dizzy Gillespie.  I think we're cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know that my great-grandfather met and married my great-grandmother when he was a young man, and had apparently gone to work in the turpentine factory--fields or factories, someplace in Virginia.  And that's where he met my great-grandmother.  His name was Lenny.  And then, and married her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is Virginia, right?
Speaker 2: He married her in Virginia, and brought her back to North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Okay, okay, so what's the story?  Did they--so, was your father raised in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father was the twelfth of fourteen children, or fourteen surviving children.  There were seventeen children in total that my grandparents had together.  But, you know... infant death.  He grew up in this place called Johns Station [North Carolina], and they all worked.  You know, it was a hard scrabble life, you know, doing cotton.  My grandfather was, I think at best, semi-literate.  My father used to tell stories about we did a sentimental journey down to North Carolina together, which is when I discovered that we were really from this place called Johns Station.  And we discovered there was a--on the land there was still a shotgun shack really that was, you know, in the footprints of what had been the original one, and sitting on that porch with cotton that dried out.  The house was abandoned by this point, and dried out cotton coming up to the, you know, right up to the porch.  Four rooms, right?  A little shotgun shack.
Speaker 1: It was a shotgun-
Speaker 2: You could--well, you could shoot a shotgun through the front door, and it would go straight out, the bullets would go out.
Speaker 1: Is this the one-
Speaker 2: Trying to imagine...
Speaker 1: --with the long corridor?
Story_ID: 57639
Speaker 1: Yeah, not that long; trying to imagine my grandmother raising all those children in that space.  You know, and my daddy telling me stories about how his father would, you know, have a good crop and know he had a crop, but he couldn't count.  He would always get cheated.  And he knew he was being cheated, but he couldn't do anything about it.  And how the older siblings, you know, the older brothers--you know, one by one left, you know, to go to find work to try to make a way.  My father got the equivalent of maybe an elementary education, you know, in a little one-room schoolhouse, when he wasn't needed to work in the fields.  And he left, but he was seventeen, sixteen.  No, I thought he was younger than that.  He was about fifteen when he left and went to--he made his way to Baltimore [Maryland] and worked there, and eventually ended up out on Long Island [New York] because some of his older brothers were there.  Three of his older brothers had come out.  And that's where he met my mother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know he came up in 1930.
Speaker 2: Now, this is interesting, because he arrives as a young man right at the onset of the Depression.
Speaker 1: The Depression had already started in the South.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The Depression, you know, people always talk about it as being the one in 1929.  But in the South, it had started in the twenties.  And so, when you start out on a farm where you don't have much?  Do you know what I mean?  Times were just so rough.  You know, so there he was.  You know, I guess he was--I think he must have come up--maybe it was even in the late twenties, because he was in his twenties when he came up, and when he met my mother.
Speaker 2: The reason why I mentioned it like that is because it seemed that being involved in service type occupations depended upon a middle class or an upper class with money.  You know, you arrive at a time when their money is the shortest.
Speaker 1: But I think that what we know is--you know, because the Depression pushed a lot of people around.  And, you know, it's all relative.  It was still better than where it was.  My, I know my father's first jobs were as jobs working in hospitals as an orderly.  And cleaning first, and then moved up to...  And when he came out to Long Island, he got another--he worked in a hospital, and he did that.  He was working as an orderly in a hospital when he and my mother met.
Story_ID: 57640
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents met?  Did they tell a story about how they-
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's called you get to his version and her version.  I think my dad was considered--I mean he was a very handsome man.  And a lot of women apparently thought he was a real catch.  My father was a very charming man and an intelligent man--not well educated--self-educated--and a very intelligent man.  And my mother said she set her cap for him.  And you know, and Daddy said that, you know, that he really liked her, but he knew he liked another, you know, contemporary of hers as well.  But, you know, they ended up together.  Because they had, they shared--which is what he talked about--similar values about the kind of lives they wanted to achieve, what they wanted to do with their lives.  And they got married in 1934, and my sister was born in 1935.  Daddy [Charles Gillespie] was still working in the hospital.  Mom [Ethel May Gillespie] was still doing domestic work and, you know, it was the war that lifted their boat.  My father was not drafted, and both he and Mom worked, you know, in one of the war factories.  There were several on Long Island [New York].  And as I said, for a lot of black folks there, it opened up new vistas.  Because you know, better pay--different, you know, skills.  And they both worked in the factory.  Mama worked there until she got pregnant with me, and I was then born in 1944.
Speaker 1: Now, that's almost at the end of the war.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.  And my sister often says--my sister is nine years older than I, my sister Charlene...  You know, I always say it's like we were born in almost two different families.  As in--she was the child of the Depression, you know, when family...  I remember when Mom [Ethel May Gillespie] and Dad [Charles Gillespie] weren't, didn't have their own place and they living at my grandmother's.  It was, you know what I mean, crowded.  You know, one of my aunts also had her two children there.  By the time I came along, they were just about ready to buy a house in Rockville Centre [New York].  You know, they had saved their money.  So, I didn't know the hard times in that way.  It's a big difference, a very big difference.
Story_ID: 57641
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, did your father continue to work for the-
Speaker 2: He worked there until, I think it was like 1946 or so.  And then, you know, I mean he then started his own floor waxing business, and he did odd jobs.  And my mom continued to work as a domestic after the war.  And then she started catering.  She worked for a caterer, and then she set up her own catering business.
Speaker 1: Now, was the whole family involved in the catering business?
Speaker 2: Indirectly, but only indirectly.  I mean, I remember being the watermelon scooper, you know, helping to make the fruit baskets and stuff.  And yes, you know, my aunts both, you know, helped, and you know, with both--sometimes with the cooking but also with the serving at the parties that my mom catered.  And then my dad became a church sexton when I was, oh, I guess I must have been about 12 or so, in one of the local white churches in town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is this an Episcopal Church, or-
Speaker 2: No, it was a Presbyterian church.
Speaker 1: Okay, Presbyterian, okay, alright.  Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, how they walked, talked, how they looked, their sense of humor, their talents--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  I think my interest back to self comes from my dad.  My dad was a thinker, a meditator.  And I know that I do that a lot.  The personality--as I know it, I have an outgoing personality.  And on many levels, that was also both of my parents in different ways.  My mom loved to be popping. (laughing).  But my father was also, you know, very gregarious.  They were social people, social people and activists.  Both of them were activists, and they'd be engaged in the world.  It was certainly something like that from both of them.  Reading--loving books--my dad.  My dad would sit, struggling sometimes to read, but--and kept a dictionary always beside him, but loving to read.  That's how he taught himself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were they members of organizations?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My parents were really something.  Before I was born, my parents organized one of the first successful boycotts that led to a major change in education in the State of New York against segregated schools out in that little town of Rockville Centre [New York], where it turned out... My mother... they discovered that when my sister and cousins were in the local elementary school that the black kids were being sent off to learn how to become mechanics, the guys.  And the girls were being taught how to be good maids, when they should have been in the classrooms learning their ABC's.  Oh, it was blatant.  And it, they sued.
Speaker 1: Now, we're going to pause here a second.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then we'll pick up in a minute.  That's amazing.  It's not amazing...
Story_ID: 57642
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, Floyd, the Floyd B. Watson story.  Now, who was Floyd B. Watson?
Speaker 1: Floyd B. Watson was the superintendent of schools in Rockville Centre [New York], Long Island in the thirties [1930's].  No, excuse me, in the forties [1940's].  And what he had basically done was--it was created a kind of de facto segregation which hadn't existed in the schools when my mother, for example, had gone there.  But the black population had increased.  And one, there was a neighborhood school that the black kids went to that was a large school.  And they had converted the upper levels into mock apartments, as well as a shop area, you know, for learning stuff for the boys.  And instead of teaching them their ABC's, they were preparing the kids for jobs as maids and, I guess, handymen.  It--when my parents discovered this--when my sister was, you know, in school and her older cousins were there--my parents organized this, a civic association, for the black community and helped organize--really organize--a boycott of the school.
Speaker 2: Do you remember the name of the organization that they organized?
Speaker 1: The?
Speaker 2: The name of the organization, of the group they organized, the civic association?
Speaker 1: The civic association?  It was called Lakeside Civic Association.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know if that was the more current name, but I can check that out and send it to you.
Speaker 2: That's one of the names.  That's good at least, yeah.
Speaker 1: What happened is that as a result of the boycott, the NAACP got involved.  And it was led, you know, to the [New York] State, and the State became involved.  And it really forced Rockville Centre [New York] to, you know, address the fact that it was effectively segregating and giving definitely an unequal education to black students.
Speaker 2: Now, you were describing the school in detail during the break.  And you said that certain rules in the school were set-
Speaker 1: Set aside as mock, so that they would look like mock homes so that the girls could, you know, learn about how to iron properly and how to clean properly, and how to set the right table.  But it wasn't for Home Ec[onomics] for your tables; it was so that you could be a good domestic worker.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, you know, I take it no such educational opportunity existed in the white-
Speaker 1: No.  There was, they were not doing the same thing for white students, of course not.  There would be Home Ec[onomics], but this was not Home Ec[onomics].  This was really "How to be a Maid 101."
Speaker 2: Now, is there any record of how the superintendent defended it?
Speaker 1: I think that there is, because there was a lawsuit.  But, do you know--I do know that the upshot was that, you know, the town agreed that they had to eventually disband that school and build a new school.  They built a school that was on the northern end of what would be the black community, which abutted an upper middle class white community.  And ironically, they named this new elementary school the Floyd B. Watson Elementary School, after that racist.
Speaker 2: Now, but to someone, he's a hero, you would say.  Well, they named the school after him, so to a certain group he was actually a hero.
Speaker 1: I guess so.  But, you know, I went to the original school.  I mean, because it took a while for all this to, you know, to wind its way through the courts.  But because of the boycott, they had ceased teaching "Maid 101",  by the time my sister was really, you know, had gone through there.  But, and then I finished my elementary school at the new Floyd B. Watson School--irony of all ironies--which was the first time really that I was in classes that were now predominantly white.  There were some white kids who were in the old elementary school, but the classes had been predominantly black.  Now, you see we moved--because of the way the district changed, the districting changed--that was no longer the case.
Speaker 2: Now, when was the case resolved?
Speaker 1: I think the case was actually resolved sometime in the early forties.  Again, I would have, I would need to check my records.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But it was in the forties?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 57643
Speaker 1: So, you know, I was telling you that to talk about--you know, my parents as activists.  So, I grew up in a household where, you know, people were interested and engaged in the life of the community, in wanting betterment for black folks.  And I was also--you know, parents--you asked me about my parents and what they were like.  My parents actively encouraged my sister and I to be thinkers, and to be outspoken.  You know, some of my earliest memories are--you know, at six o'clock, there would be a whistle would blow in town.  And you knew you would get your butt home--because I had to set the table.  You know, could be out playing with my friends, but I had to go and set the table.
Speaker 2: So, there was a whistle that blew at six o'clock in town?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: Was it a factory whistle, or a--?
Speaker 1: It was like a fire whistle.  But it always blew...  I think it probably still does out there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know why.
Speaker 2: There's a, you know, there's a book called 'Sundown Towns' [by James L. Loewen, 2005] about--originally it was about three towns in Illinois where a whistle would blow at six, which meant that all black people, mostly black men, had to be out of white areas.
Speaker 1: No, that wasn't what this was.  But, you know what I mean...  So, there would be this whistle.  It was like--I thought it was really to tell everybody that it was time to go home to have supper, (laughter) because that's what it meant for me.  You had to come home and, you know, and set the table.  But you know, as a little, little girl, you know, I remember sitting on, you know, the telephone books that would be stacked up on the dining room chair.  And, you know, there was always a lot of conversation at our table.  And I knew that--you know, at some point, you know...  But my sister, who was nine years older and very, very smart, you know, skipped two grades...  She was like, "Whoa," you know, and had an opinion about everything.  But I also knew that at some point my daddy was going to turn and say, "And what do you think, Baby?"  And they expected me to think about things.
Speaker 2: Now, was it just you and your sister?
Speaker 1: Yes.  There was just two of us.  Even though you have a photograph of her there, I call her my third sister, Joyce Mitchell.  Joyce was my sister's best friend.  They were the same age.  And from the earliest I can recall, Joyce ate supper with us almost every night.  Her family was a lot poorer than we were.  My mother was concerned that because Joyce had sickly that she wasn't getting enough to eat.  And so, she talked to Joyce's mother and asked her mother if Joyce could have supper with us.  So, you know, I grew up with in effect, two sisters, if you will.
Speaker 2: And your sister being nine years older-
Speaker 1: It was a big gap.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, she could, she could help you, you know.  She was almost like a-
Speaker 1: She taught me to read when I was three years old.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  She was like, you know, very much a big sister.
Story_ID: 57644
Speaker 1: Now, I wonder if your parents ever discussed it.  But your parents started a business on their own at a certain point, rather than working for, directly for a salary from somebody else.
Speaker 2: My dad did that, you know.  I mean but, you know, then, you know, his business didn't do as well.  So, that's when he became a church sexton.  But he'd always have another thing on the side--repairing televisions...  You name it, he was doing it.  My mom always maintained, you know, a couple of women who she cleaned for, you know.  And then she had the catering business.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if--you know, when people, you know, sue the school board or sue the city in a civil rights, you know, context, usually the complainants are punished in some way by the communities that they, they live in.
Speaker 2: You know, that didn't happen-
Speaker 1: Job pressure, you know, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: That didn't happen.  If anything, you know, I knew that my parents were well-respected in that town.  My mother--I always find it, you know, so fascinating.  Rockville Centre [New York] has one of the best school districts, and has had for many decades one of the best school districts in the country.  It always ranks very high.  And they had something which I think they probably still do, called the Board of Better Education.  You know, the PTA's and stuff were really powerful in suburban communities.  And there was this Board of Better Education, which was like the "Uber" PTA.
Speaker 1: The Board of Better Education?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Board for Better Education.  And these are usually the PTA presidents and other women.  My mother served on that for years.  And I always found it so interesting, that here she would be sitting there as a clear peer of women whose homes she also cleaned.
Speaker 1: That's something.
Story_ID: 57645
Speaker 1: You know, but there was--you know, I mean, they were always engaged in like village affairs, and going to the town meetings.  My father and my mother served--my father was the president of the civic association.  My mom was the secretary.  And I mean one of my father's, you know, big pushes was, you know, really to improve services in the black community, because the services were not good.  A lot of homes--I know there was some old apartment buildings that were not well-cared for.  There were issues with the police, who were horrific--not surprising, you know.  There was a lot of violence in the community, partly because, you know, Rockville Centre [New York] also had one of the great--I want to call it, great juke joints. You know, there was the bar, the bar and lounge.  The barber shop was owned by one of my good friends, Dorothy. Dorothy McCludell's daddy was the numbers king for Nassau County [New York], baby.  And they lived in Rockville Centre [New York].  And on, you know, Thursdays and Fridays and Saturday nights--Rockville Centre--the main drag in Rockville Centre was jumping.  Because, again, it would be the time when a lot of the--they were called girls back then, although they were women--who slept in, you know, who were off.  So, it attracted a lot of guys.  I mean, it was wild.  And there would be fights.  There would be, there were "cut um, shoot-ums."  And I mean, one of the things--you know, I always laugh, because when people ask you where you're from, and you say you grew up, you know, in a suburban town, they have kind of an Ozzie and Harriet kind of, you know, view of it.  But in some ways, I guess it was.  But it was also--you know, I can tell, you know...  Violence...  I was very aware of it, saw a lot of it, and was unperturbed.  You know, so I can tell you about the time, you know, coming out on a Sunday morning.  We had a big front yard.  And a man apparently had been stabbed and had attempted, I think, to get out.  But anyway, he crawled and he died, and died in our front yard.  I remember I was the first one up.  I open the door, I come out.  And, you know, kids, we are blood thirsty.  I am looking over at his body.  I remember finally I go in and I say, "Mama, there's a dead man..." (laughter).  I'm sorry, it's not funny.  But, you know, what I'm trying to say is like it wasn't that kind of sheltered, though my mother was horrified.  And then my father, I don't know what he thought that was going to do.  He ended up building a wall across the front of our yard that summer.  And I guess he thought that would help to...  (laughter).
Speaker 2: He was trying to protect his family.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know.  But I never felt unsafe, because everybody knew everybody.  Do you know what I mean?  And my grandmother was like the matriarch of the community.  And so, I mean, it always intrigued me.  In the summertime my grandmother would be sitting.  She had a house with a high front porch, you know.  It was on the corner.  She would be sitting on the front porch.  And even--you know, the local drunks would be staggering, and they would straighten up and stop cussing when they came in front of my grandmother's house, so they could say "Good morning or good afternoon, Mrs. Young."  She didn't play.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 57646
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, in this little community where the black community...  You know, it was the--I guess the center, the recreation center for the surrounding-
Speaker 2: Sort of a--yeah, for--yeah, it was one of the hubs.  You know, and the church--you know, again, because church was always important.  And for many years--I think until I was about 12 when the new black Baptist church was built...  The old Baptist church which is the one I grew up in, was right next door to our house, you know.
Speaker 1: What was the name--did you all attend the Baptist church?
Speaker 2: Uh huh, Shiloh Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's one in every town, I think, Shiloh Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Shiloh Baptist.  My grandmother was one of the founders of that church. Okay.  Is this church founded around the turn of the century?
Speaker 1: It was founded in the early, in the late teens [1910's], early twenties [1920's]--Shiloh Baptist.
Speaker 2: And it's next door?
Speaker 1: It was, it originally was right on Banks Avenue, which is the street that we lived on.  And it was right next door to our house.  So, it meant even when you didn't go to church, you were in church.  You know, you heard all the other services that were going on.
Speaker 2: Was your family in church a lot, or--?
Speaker 1: Well, they were churchgoers.  I mean, every Sunday for sure.  Daddy [Charles Gillespie] was a trustee.  And, but I was never--and I went.  You know, Sunday School, daily vacation bible school (laughter)--the whole nine yards, you know.  Yeah, that was the home church.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Now, did, would you say your values are more derived from your parents, or from your religious experiences, would you say?
Speaker 1: I'd say--and of course, you know, it's hard to draw the line between the two--but more from my parents and my grandmother.  And a lot of those, of course, were still very much religious.  My father was a profoundly religious person, quietly but profoundly.  So, yeah.  And to a degree--I mean, of course what I learned in church.  But, you know, I love the black church.  But I also, even as a kid, had problems with it.
Speaker 2: Well-
Story_ID: 57647
Speaker 1: The hypocrisy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I remember so clearly.  I must have been about eleven--no, even before that.  I got kicked out of Sunday School.  I got kicked out of Sunday School when I was eight, nine years old because I asked the Sunday School teacher, "If God separated Adam and Eve, so then how did we get here?"  She washed my mouth out with soap, and sent me home; called me a "um hum."  And I remember telling my parents, "I'm not going back."
Speaker 2: Now, I've never had my mouth washed out with soap.  Now, that's got to be-- Oh, I've had my mouth washed out with soap a couple of times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a big mouth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother, I remember washed it out.  I think I said, "Darn it", or something, you know.  And then I said "Damn" once, and definitely got the taste of--at least it was either Ivory or Palmolive.  Not...  Well, you'll never forget it.  But I remember when I told my parents what happened, and I said "I'm not going back", I must have been about nine or ten.  I didn't want to go back.  And they didn't make me, which I've always appreciated.  You know-
Speaker 1: Did you ever go back?
Speaker 2: I never went back to Sunday School.  I would attend regular church, but I didn't go back to Sunday School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then I remember being, I guess I was about eleven.  And one Sunday the minister called a girl, she was a teenager, in front of the church, and told the--and she had supposedly begged the church for forgiveness, because she was pregnant.  And, you know, what a sin that was.  I remember I was sitting next to my grandmother, and I was like steaming.  I knew this was wrong.  I remember saying "This is wrong, this is wrong."  I couldn't put my finger on what--you know.  But it was, like, she didn't get pregnant by herself.  They weren't calling any man or guy up.  And not surprisingly, she ran away; never saw her again.  There was something wrong about that.  You know, the black church can be very unforgiving, very narrow, in some ways that I have problems with.  You know, I love the music, love the rituals.  You know, I love the fact that when I'm there, I feel in touch with my ancestors.  But I still have problems every once in a while.  Finding a black preacher who does not make my back teeth grind, can be sometimes difficult.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I digressed, sorry.
Story_ID: 57648
Speaker 1: It's not a digression.  That's the truth.  So, well, tell me about school now.  Where did you start?  What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: It was the Clinton Elementary School in Rockville Centre, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was Clinton Elementary School.  Now, is this primarily a black school?
Speaker 2: It was supposedly a neighborhood school that was primarily black kids and a few white kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was primarily-
Speaker 2: And it was basically, most of the school was empty, because it wasn't like there were a lot of us.  And the rest of the school was used for children with, who suffered with cerebral palsy.
Speaker 1: Now, had the neighborhood been like an all white neighborhood at one time?
Speaker 2: At one point.  I mean, when my grandmother talked about when she and my grandfather bought their house, they were the first black homeowners in the town.  And that must have been like about 1905, late... yeah, about 1905 when they bought that house.  And that neighborhood had been mainly Italian.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your teachers?  Were they, did you have any African-American teachers?
Speaker 2: No.  No, they were all white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then in third grade we moved to the new elementary school that had been built, again, to make sure that we were integrated, really integrated into the town.  And that was the Floyd B. Watson Elementary School.
Speaker 1: This is, what grade is this?
Speaker 2: Third grade.
Speaker 1: Third grade, okay, alright.  This is an irony, Floyd B. Watson.
Speaker 2: The man who had, you know, instituted his own up-south segregation of the schools, yep, now had a school named after him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had retired, though, I think by that point.  I think he had retired.  And then I went to Southside Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Now, before I take you there-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At the first level here at Clinton Elementary School, were there any teachers that you particularly liked, or who were mentors to you at this point, this stage?  Any teachers that made your teachings better or anything or, you know, that you had a good rapport with?
Speaker 2: I remember there was one teacher whose name I think was Mrs. Clinton who was, who made me think I was very smart.  But the teachers that stood out for me were really the ones I went to at Watson School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My fourth--my fifth and sixth grade teachers, I remember.  I had a Miss Pulusias (ph).  Don't ask me how to spell her name.
Speaker 1: Pulusias?
Speaker 2: Pulusias.  I know she was Greek, of Greek origin.  Miss Pulusias was my fifth grade teacher, and she was tough, and she was demanding.  And it's when I realized that I was as smart, if not smarter, than most of the white kids in that class.  Because now, it was a predominantly white class.  I'd been used to being a smart kid in class. Do you know what I mean?  Now, I knew I was a really smart kid.  Because as you all know, in America you're always going to be judged against...  And my sixth grade teacher, Mr. McDonald, which was the first time I remember having a male teacher...  Again, you know, both of those teachers really impressed upon me that I was very smart.  It was so interesting; I remember it was Marjorie Garber and Marcia Gillespie, and we were considered to be the two smartest girls in the class.  I think we were the two smartest people in the class.
Story_ID: 57649
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you gravitate towards any particular subject matter in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Not in elementary school.  Well, I didn't like math, I knew that.  But not--you know, English and stuff, all the other stuff, I was good at, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a project or anything that you completed that you were really proud of in the elementary school level?
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Or something--it might be a play or something?
Speaker 2: I mean, I mean Marjorie Garber and I used to produce plays, I remember in elementary school.  But do you know what I mean?  We'd write them, and usually either one of us would get a good role, because we wrote them.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: Marjorie Garber was interesting, too, because she was my first white friend, you know, kid friend.  I've never had a... because you know... I mean for all intents and purposes... you know, all my, I mean all my friends were black.  I grew up in a black, you know, in the black part of town.  But, you know, Marjorie was my first white friend.  And the first time I ever went into a white person's home, was being invited to her house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, her parents must have been smart, too, on some level?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were, clearly.  (laughter).  And she is, too.  I mean Marjorie is a professor up at Harvard [University].  She was the smartest girl in the class.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, what does she teach?
Speaker 2: She teaches on gender issues--gender and identity have become her specialty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the next level is middle school, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Right, which was junior high school; we didn't call it middle school then, which went from seven... seven, eighth, ninth grades.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Southside Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Rockville Centre [New York].
Speaker 1: Southside Junior High School.  So now, at that level, were there any special teachers or activities that you want to tell us about?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I mean--and what you have to understand is it was also the time when you got to meet, you know, all the kids who lived in the school district--went to the same, you know, junior and senior high school.  And what the school district was made up was all of Rockville Centre [New York], but it also included parts of other towns.  You know, the school district lines were sometimes slightly different.  So it was part of--sometimes still a little bit of Oceanside.  So it was also like where, again, where, you know...  By this time, it was like--I don't want to say, you know, the black kids who were my age mates--we were like, you know--of the few sprinkles of chocolate, very few.  Now, we're in a very big sea of cream (laughter).  Teachers that stood out... my goodness...  Miss Sherman was an English teacher in junior high school.  And Miss Sherman--you know, back in the day there was an emphasis that was on grammar.  You had to learn your grammar and diagram sentences, and really understand participles, and all that stuff.  And I, on many levels was, you know, a good but lazy student.  You know, I could kind of float, and still usually get by really well.  She wasn't having it.  She would get me up on that board and she would like--to the blackboard, you know, to diagram sentences.  And she could be scathing.  She would really push me on it because I wouldn't, I didn't really want to study it.  I just wanted--I thought I could just get away with it.  She made it clear that you had to work harder than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was important.
Speaker 1: So, we're going to pause here.
Story_ID: 57650
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were talking Southside Junior High School [Rockville Centre, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Grammar instruction.  And you were being pushed by Miss Sherman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, that's what really stood out for me--was that it was her demanding that I step up.  It was really important, because I tended to be--the things that I was interested in, I would love.  But the stuff that I wasn't particularly interested in, I would try to skate through.
Speaker 1: Now, what were you particularly interested in?
Speaker 2: I loved history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I loved history, I was fascinated by it.  I was fascinated by literature, really good writing.
Speaker 1: What were you reading then?
Speaker 2: Everything.  Everything--I read everything that I could put my hands on.  I read every book that my parents had.  I read everything in my grandmother's--she had a little, you know, one of those little--what do you call them--bookcases.  You know, I read all of her books.  So, I read everything from Countee Cullen to--do you know what I mean--to, oh goodness.  Who was that author?  Frank Yerby.
Speaker 1: Frank Yerby, right.
Speaker 2: Back in the day, right?  Frank Yerby, who wrote, you know those southern bodice rippers.  God, you know what I mean, the trash flash.  I mean, my grandmother would call it trash, but--
Speaker 1: Frank Yerby...  many...  'The Foxes of Harrow'-
Speaker 2: Right, all of those.  You know, melodramas... the Southern... which you know, the idea that this was a black man writing about all this ante... about antebellum stuff.  I mean, "puleeze".  But I, you know, so I read everything.  You know, the library and I were old friends by then.  Do you know what I mean?  I went to the library every week.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--so, Frank Yerby-
Speaker 2: I was an indiscriminate reader.  I mean I read novels; I read, do you know what I mean--poetry, whatever caught my fancy.  Do you know, the one--the only rule that my parents had was that if you start a book, you have to finish it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they didn't care what I was reading, but I had to finish it.
Speaker 1: Now, did your parents subscribe to the periodicals?
Speaker 2: It was Ebony.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was always Ebony.  They never really were subscribers to Jet.  Every once in a while they would get Jet, but they didn't really love Jet.  So, no.  Newsday, which was the newspaper, I know.  And the Long Island Press.  And I was expected to read the papers.  For a while they subscribed to Life.  I remember that, because I certainly remember reading it at home.  My sister was a voracious reader, so she was always bringing books in the house.  And when she would put one down, I'd pick it up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and you were a kid, I guess, when your sister went to college?
Speaker 2: My sister, who had skipped two grades, graduated--literally, she was 15 when she graduated--15 just going on 16 when she graduated from high school.  And my father thought she was too young to go to college then, so she stayed home.  I remember--and I think she worked--she worked in the library for a year.  And then she went off to Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] when she was 17.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was she there by the time that Bill Cosby was there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that's what it sounds like.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, your sister, she's going to college.  She's bringing back information on college and books and ideas and--?
Speaker 2: She always had plenty ideas, a lot of talk.  My sister is a big talker still.  Ooh, she can talk.  But I was just reading, you know, any and everything.  You know, my aunt, my mother's older sister, my Aunt Violet Sweeper.  Aunt Vi was a big reader and, you know, and she would lend me her books.  You know, again, the rule was if you started it, you have to finish it.  And I remember the book that really pushed me, because the first time, I found it very rough-going.  It was Great--Dickens' 'Great Expectations', which I found sluggish.  But you know, I remember, you know, my mother, you know...  Because she would always say, "What are you reading, and how are you doing with it?"  And I was telling her I really didn't like it.  She said, "Well, you know the rule.  You've got to finish it; you've got to finish it."  And, you know, I mean, they always impressed on us, don't try to jump over pages.  You know, really finish it.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you finished 'Great Expectations'?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It was not my favorite Dickens.  But you know, I certainly read the other--all the other, his other works.  But, no.
Story_ID: 57651
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you're really doing a lot of reading.  Now, did you, when the-
Speaker 2: -so, you were growing up when the Civil Rights Movement was on television a lot, and-
Speaker 1: Well, it was just beginning to come on television, absolutely.  You know, I mean we're talking about--I was ten in 1954, I remember.  So, therefore Civil Rights was really moving up, you know.  I remember when, the, you know, the boycott, the first--the Montgomery bus boycott [Alabama]--and, you know, my parents leading a drive for shoes.  I remember, because they were sending shoes South, you know, because people were wearing out shoes marching.
Speaker 2: I don't even know about that episode in history.  But people actually were collecting shoes--?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: --and sending them South?
Speaker 1: Yes, sending them down to Montgomery [Alabama], because, you know, I mean they were needed.
Speaker 2: That was in 1956?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The Montgomery bus boycott.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And there was--there was lots of talk about the Movement in the house.  I remember Bayard Rustin coming to our house.
Speaker 2: Now, that's something.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: Very interesting.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  That was like one of those moments I've never forgotten.  It was supper, he came for supper.  He had been a visitor before, I remember.  But this particular time he was talking about, you know, the movement; what the hopes were for the movement and, you know, SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  And he it was a part of the fundraising, because again, my parents were known activists in the area.  And thinking to myself, I remember this about...  I'd never seen or listened to a more elegant black person before, like that.  Bayard Rustin, you know, spoke with that, you know, accent--you know, slightly British.  He was very handsome and very--had a flamboyance in a way that was--made him, you know, something.  And he used words... Oh, my God.  You know, like these amazing words.  And I remember, you know, making notes so that I could go look up, you know, words I didn't know.  Bayard Rustin, umm.  And I remember my sister was very active in youth organizations.  We went to rallies--going to rallies with my sister and my cousin Jackie back in those days.  It was an amazing time.
Story_ID: 57652
Speaker 1: Now, was, did your parents go to the March on Washington in '63' [1963]?
Speaker 2: In 60--well, first it was the Youth March on Washington.  But that preceded that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember going to that one.
Speaker 1: Now, what year is that?
Speaker 2: The Youth March on Washington [1959] must have been 1960, 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe 60--it was before I went to college.  So, I went to college in '62' [1962].   So, it was either '60' [1960] or '61' [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I remember-
Speaker 1: You were in high school then, yeah.
Speaker 2: I remember, you know, the first time I saw Harry Belafonte up close.  Oh, be still my heart. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, I'm not even familiar with-
Speaker 2: With the youth March on Washington?
Speaker 1: --with the youth March on Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, about how many youth participated?  I don't know if you would even know, but-
Speaker 2: There were thousands of people, but it wasn't as big as the...  But it was a lot of people there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was--who was the keynote speaker?
Speaker 2: I have no memory; I have no memory of it.  You know, my biggest memory was that there were all these young black folks, and they were talking about freedom.  And that I looked up, and there was Harry Belafonte and his wife, Julie, wandering through the crowd.  It was the most exciting--the March was so exciting.
Speaker 1: This is--this is the first year of John Kennedy's presidency, right? No, it wasn't.  He became president-
Speaker 2: Well, wasn't yet.  That's right.  He didn't take office until '61' [1961].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right, because he campaigned-
Speaker 1: So, yeah.
Speaker 2: Eisenhower was still in-
Speaker 1: I guess it must have been like '60' [1960] or '61' [1961], as I said, during this--when this happened.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I have to double-check that day.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right, all right.
Speaker 1: But, you know, I mean...  So, there was so much...  You know, it was a very alive time.  Awareness was rising.
Story_ID: 57653
Speaker 1: Were you a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Youth?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, in high school?
Speaker 2: In high school.  But there wasn't an active--I wasn't really that active in it, and I don't recall why.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I know that--you know, going on, you know, boycotting Woolworth's...  You know, I remember marching, doing that, you know, on Long Island [New York].  Because again--you know, with the sit-ins about the lunch counters...
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, this is just for those that don't know:  The scenario was that the Woolworth's down South, you know, was segregated, right?
Speaker 2: Well, the Woolworth's throughout the South, you know, practiced segregation.  And so, therefore, blacks were not allowed to eat at the lunch counters.  If you wanted food, you had to have it ordered, and get it in the back.  And so, you know, some of the first of the sit-ins were really about, you know, integrating those lunch counters.  And they started in North Carolina, and then spread to other, you know, throughout the South.
Speaker 1: Yeah, since Woolworth's was a chain-
Speaker 2: Right.  So, very appropriate, because Woolworth's was also in other places in the country.  You know, there were a series of boycotts that were also staged outside the South, to put more pressure on the company to capitulate.  And I remember, you know, marching, holding my sign going to Hempstead on Long Island [New York], which is where I think the Woolworth's was-- carrying the signs, singing the songs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was ill when the big March happened.  And I remember I couldn't go.  And my, my mother I remember stayed home, and so did my dad.  They stayed with me.  I was ill.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you watch it on television?
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense at the time that what Dr. [Martin Luther] King was saying in that famous speech was going to be, you know, quoted over and over and over?
Speaker 2: What, "I Have a Dream"?  I knew it certainly resonated.  I knew that, you know, it was important; that he was extraordinary.  Who knew what would happen, you know?  But it was--I know I'd heard a great speech.  But no, I had no idea it would become, you know, iconic.
Speaker 1: I know Bayard Rustin is featured prominently in the March, as the organizer of the March-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --basically, you know.
Story_ID: 57654
Speaker 1: Right.  But it was also a period where Bayard really took a backseat, if you will.  Because again, you have to remember--you know, there was still this whole anti-communist thing.  I remember the FBI coming to our house back in those days because they were quote, unquote "investigating" some people.  They wanted my parents to give them information about a Jewish couple in the town who were activists.  And my parents often, you know, worked on issues with them.  And I remember my father telling these creepy FBI guys--I was 16 years old--to get out of his house... and them threatening... not even subtly.  My sister had applied for a job as a teacher for the Air Force.  You could be a civilian employee of the Air Force.  She wanted to travel, and she had become a teacher.  And she was teaching children with disability, learning disabilities.  And the Air Force was I think either the one, or maybe another one.  But it was a branch of the service which allowed service people to bring children who had learning disabilities overseas.  A lot--at that time, all branches didn't allow that.  So, she had applied and was hoping to go overseas to teach.  And I remember my father and mother were telling these people, these FBI guys, that they weren't going to cooperate with them.  You know, first they talked about, well, you know, "We know you are associated with Bayard Rustin."  And that was supposed to, you know... And that's when I remember my father almost lost his temper.  And then he told them--because I was eavesdropping (laughter)--I remember he told them that they knew my sister had applied to teach overseas, and that, you know, this could count against her getting the job, but people question loyalties.  And my father said to my mother, "Get the gentlemen their hats."  And I remember wondering, you know, if she was going to get, you know, to teach, you know, abroad like she wanted to.  It did come through, she did go.  She went to Japan.  But it was like creepy, creepy, creepy, you know, the FBI...  my God.  But why was I telling you that story?  Oh, because, again, you know, with the McCarthy hearings which were to ferret out the communists--the way in which Paul Robeson had been hounded, you know.  So, Bayard Rustin really stepped back because there was great fear that they didn't want the civil rights movement--for people to try to undermine it by accusing it of being, you know, "Red".  God, this country.
Speaker 2: Right.  I know he did get, you know, identified at the March on Washington, and his organizer, you know, when it was on TV.
Speaker 1: Right.  But he was still background.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I often wondered why-
Speaker 1: That's why.
Speaker 2: --the person that organized it was not in a more prominent position.
Speaker 1: That's why.
Speaker 2: And later, of course, I found out.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Because if I'm watching it at age 13-
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I'm wondering why, you know.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Those were the days.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 57655
Speaker 1: You know--so, you know, junior high school and into senior high school, which was Southside Senior High School...  May I do that jump?
Speaker 2: Yes, Southside Senior High School.  Now this is?
Speaker 1: In Rockville Centre [New York].
Speaker 2: You started in 19--?
Speaker 1: I graduated from high school...  I can do it backwards, okay.  I graduated from high school in 1962.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you started in '68' [1968]?
Speaker 1: Three-
Speaker 2: No, '58' [1958], right?
Speaker 1: --three terms, three years-
Speaker 2: Three years, okay, '59' [1959], then.
Speaker 1: Three years high school, three years junior high school. Okay, '59' [1959] then.  No...
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962], '61' [1961] to '60' [1960], '59' [1959]. Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I started in there.  Again, I was popular.  I was a popular kid in school, in both junior and senior high school.  And you know, like I held class offices.  I was like the vice-president of the junior class and vice-president of the senior class, or secretary, or some sort of silliness.  I had a good time.  (laughter).  I--again, there was one teacher, Miss Austin, who taught history, who again made me feel smart, because I loved history.  By then there was actually one black teacher.  I think it was still the only black teacher, as far as I knew, at that time in Rockville Centre [New York].  And I remember, because my parents had him to--had been pressing for them to hire black teachers--and have him to dinner.  But I never, he never taught me because he taught an advanced English class, and I was never in the advanced English class.  So-
Speaker 2: That seems odd.
Speaker 1: No, it didn't, because I was lazy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I liked to read, you know what I mean?  I liked to write, but I was lazy.
Story_ID: 57656
Speaker 1: I mean, when you look back, were you really lazy?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was one of those students who, if I liked something I, you know, went in it.  But I was not consistent.  I was not consistent about, like finishing, doing my homework.  Or what I would do often is wait till the last minute.  I mean I laugh with students in my classes now, because I know who they are, because that's who I was.  You know, I mean in that way; if I'm, you know...  So you know, I mean I knew that I could get, you know, eighties, you know on tests, without really doing too much.  You know, and if I had worked harder, I could have had nineties and been in the Honor Society.  But I didn't do that.  I got nineties in some things like history or--do you know what I mean, that I liked--but not consistent.  And so, I remember, you know, when it was about the time, you know, you start to think about college.  It was, you know, the beginning of junior year.  This guidance counselor--I remember her name, Miss Vercannon--pulled me into her office and said to me that she, you know, didn't think it was worth my while to apply to colleges; that she didn't think that, you know, I was really college material; that I should really think about secretarial school, or something like that.  And I remember looking at her.  And I went home and, you know, at supper that evening--six o'clock--the whistle...  Remember, supper in my house, in my family's house--telling my parents this.  Now, if you got eighties in a school like Southside [High School, Rockville Centre, New York], you were still doing well.  I mean I was more than, you know, doing well.  And I remember my parents looking at each other.  You know, those speaking looks, you know, adults give each other--and nothing was said.  The next day, you know, I'm getting ready, you know, to go out to catch the school bus to go to--because the high school was on the up--the far side of town.  We were bussed.  My mother said, "Oh, no, you don't have to worry about taking the bus today.  I'm coming with you."  Okay. And my mother went sailing in there.  My father was waiting for her.  (laughter).  I don't know what they said.  But I do know that guidance counselor--the next thing, you know, out of her mouth to me was, you know, "Of course is going to be helping you, you know, with your college, you know, because you must have mis-heard me."  I hadn't mis-heard her.  But so, that kind of attitude was essentially what she was really telling all the black students.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, you probably wouldn't be surprised to know that we have maybe--out of the collection of maybe four or five hundred--the same counseling stories.
Speaker 2: Of course.  You know, no surprises.  But what they, what she didn't recognize was you don't mess with Charles and Ethel Gillespie's baby.  That was clear.  And what was so interesting is here is this girl, this black girl--me, who of course was a nice Negro girl--we're dealing with late fifties [1950's], you know what I mean, early sixties [1960's]--who's you know, vice president of her class, do you know what I mean?  Engaged in, you know, all these leadership, other leadership activities.  But you're going to--you think because she is black that, you know, that she has, she can only go this far.  Shame on her.
Speaker 1: That is a nice paper for somebody in this collection about counseling robbing us in a certain era.
Speaker 2: And I'm sure it's still going on, darling.  I know it is.  So, you know, what can I tell you?
Story_ID: 57657
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did, what advice did you get from--and who--was it a counselor or was it some other source that influenced your choice of college?
Speaker 2: One of the things that happened--and I'm not sure if it was the counselor--if it was she or one of the other guidance counselors.  But in looking for potential colleges, I applied for scholarship funds because my parents were not people of real means...  for the National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students[NSS-FNS], which back in the day... boy, I love that phrase... gets used back in the day.  Excuse me, I need to have a sip of water.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  Alright, but back in the day this was such an extraordinary organization.  Because the goal was, as it was my understanding, that they were to help provide pathways for--we were Negroes then (laughter)--black youth--to have access to higher education.  And so, there were colleges across the country who were in partnership to one degree or another with this organization, which was this National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students [NSS-FNS].  And I was accepted into the, by the, as an applicant.  And then they, through them, I was put in touch with--you know, my stuff was sent out to a number of schools.  You know, I was...  And Lake Forest [College, Illinois] was one of the schools that responded.  You know, the NSS-FNS [National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students] went over my grades, my transcripts and stuff--and they looked at I guess what, within the pool of schools, which ones they thought would be good matches.  So, I remember, it was Lake Forest was one; Oberlin [College, Ohio] was one; another, there was a school further west.  I don't even remember, but it was too far west and it was close to nothing.  And I remember thinking, no.  Grinnell [College, Iowa], or something.
Speaker 1: There's Grinnell College out in Iowa.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Uh uh, too far away.  And then I remember, you know, thinking about, you know, there were other schools that I was interested in, like Penn State [University, Pennsylvania] or whatever.  But Lake Forest [College, Illinois], I remember, you know, really stepped up, and they offered really good scholarship aid.  You know, where it was both outright scholarship and then work, you know.  And then I--also working, you know, off some of it.  It was near Chicago [Illinois].  The photographs of the school look like, you know, the kind of school you'd see in the movies.  And so, I remember thinking, this is where I want to go.  I remember I met with, you know, the recruiter, who really encouraged me and made it very clear that I was, you know, the student they were looking for.  And my parents approved, and so that's where I went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't visit ahead of time?
Speaker 2: No, I couldn't afford to that.
Speaker 1: All right, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, the photographs...  The first time I saw Lake Forest [College, Illinois] was when my parents drove me out there, you know, with my little trunk, in the end of the summer of 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, Lake Forest is in the north suburbs of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: It's right on Lake Michigan.  It's considered to be one of the wealthiest towns, I think, in the state.  It had, was one of those places--it's a bit like--the closest I guess that I knew that would have been akin to it would have been some of the towns on the north shore of Long Island [New York] where the very wealthy, you know, individuals had estates.  And so, there were all these old estates along the water.  And Lake Forest was this small liberal arts college.  And I guess it was either Presbyterian or--I know it was started by one of the church groups, because we had to go to--I remember Chapel was mandatory.  But you know, again...  And Lake Forest was one of those towns that still had gaslights in the town.  Oh, it was beautiful.  I mean, it was like a picture.  It was like, "Where have I landed?"  The other thing, of course, that no one had prepared me for, was that there had been maybe one or two black students on the campus prior.  This was the beginning of Lake Forest's integration push.  So, the year that I went, started there, they brought in twelve black students--six boys and six girls.  I always say it was just like Noah's Ark.
Speaker 1: (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, but you do see the humor.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 57658
Speaker 1: So, Lake Forest College [Illinois].  Now, who were, or were there any special teachers or mentors at Lake Forest College?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, two in particular.  I majored in American Studies.  No surprise, because I've always loved history.  And, you know, I was really fortunate because two really outstanding professors of American Studies were there.  John Sproat, Jack Sproat was the chairman.
Speaker 1: S-P-R...
Speaker 2: S-P-R-O-A-T, Sproat.  And Nathan Irving Huggins.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.  Nathan I. Huggins, the late Nathan Huggins.
Speaker 2: That's right.  He came up, joined the faculty when I was a junior, for my junior and senior years.  So, I, you know, had the great privilege of being taught by both he and Sproat... real standing in the world of American Studies.
Speaker 1: Now, is, was Huggins the first African-American professor at Lake Forest [College, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I would have thought so.
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know, and God--you know what I mean...  Nate [Nathan I. Huggins], he was, you know, he was something.  You know, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.  And you know, again, it was--so, the girl who, you know, used to just sort of, was happy skating, became an honor student.  You know, I was hooked on history--hooked on American Studies, which combined everything that had always fascinated me--culture, you know what I mean--religion and art, and everything within the context of society and history.  And so, I was like, I was on fire, you know, intellectually.  And you know this is before the--you know, all the rules about, you know, fraternization weren't there.  You know, so, you know--look, I mean I dated Nate [Nathan] Huggins there for awhile.  But he didn't give me a good grade because I dated him.  You know, it was off and on.  It wasn't a big deal.  But, you know, I mean I remember even going out and being taken out to dinner by him, you know.  One evening we'd gone to Chicago, and there we were going to see John Hope Franklin.  It was the first time I met Dr. Franklin.
Speaker 1: At the University of Chicago.
Speaker 2: He was teaching there and, you know, and he and Nate were close.  And I remember sitting--because Dr. Franklin, you know, grew orchids.  It was his passion, other than history and his family.  That was his passion.  And I remember we were sitting out in the greenhouse.  They had like a greenhouse attached.  He lived on the north side of Chicago, I guess it was... and amidst the orchids, listening and occasionally joining in, but mainly listening.  These two towering intellectuals talking about black history; talking about things they were working on; thinking about, you know.  I never forgot that moment.  It was extraordinary.
Speaker 1: It was an exciting time period for--I think that--I mean, not only was John Hope Franklin at the University of Chicago, but there were other people at Northwestern [University, Illinois], too.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I mean-
Speaker 1: But there was a lot there for a while.
Speaker 2: I'm sure.  I mean, it was, you know, it was jumping up.  But you know, again, to be in college in that period of the sixties--the anti-war movement had started; the anti-Vietnam...  I mean, guys were trying to dodge the draft.  Civil Rights was, you know, jumping.  I remember, you know, helping to organize students to go, to become--started a regular tutorial in the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago [Chicago Housing Authority Projects].  I'd go there once a week, every Saturday.
Story_ID: 57659
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about this college.  Let's slow this down a little bit, and tell us about this program at Robert Taylor Homes.  This is the inner cities tutorial program?
Speaker 2: It was a tutorial program.  I don't remember if it had a name.  I don't know quite how it even--I think it was the--he was the chaplain and a professor of religion, who started the program.
Speaker 1: From Lake Forest [College]?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was being done I think in partnership with a local church in Chicago.  But I can't, I don't recall the particulars.  But I do know that a bunch of us, most of the black students, not all of them--and not exclusively all the black students; there were a number of white students who also had--and became part of this tutorial program.
Speaker 1: Were the tutorial sessions held in that center on Federal Street?  It's like a, it was a community center for Robert Taylor [Homes Housing Project, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: I can't, I would not begin to tell you.
Speaker 1: On 51st and Federal [Streets, Chicago, Illinois], I think.
Speaker 2: It could have been.  I know it was some sort of a center.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so we, you know, did those. There was also my--I guess it was either my, maybe my sophomore year--a black student, she was a year behind me--whose father was the president of Miles College [Alabama].  I'm trying to remember her first name... but who became a student at Lake Forest [College].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was, you know, a number--work being done.  I want to call it in helping in being in solidarity with students at Miles College [Alabama], you know.  So, there was a lot of fundraising going on.  But Lake Forest [College] was also (laughter) one of the schools I think that got called one of the drug schools of America, too.  Because, you know, I mean this was the--most of the time when people were experimenting with--do you know what I mean, everything from, you know, LSD and mushrooms--and you name it.  And Lake Forest [College] was definitely in the thick of that.  But just a great time to be alive and to be in school, because you know, all these amazing speakers were coming through and-
Story_ID: 57660
Speaker 1: Well, like who came through?
Speaker 2: Studs Terkel, I remember speaking there.  I remember--oh God, what was his name?  A wonderful--a journalist.
Speaker 1: Royko?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Mike Royko?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I thought it was him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.
Speaker 1: Did Dick Gregory ever come to campus?
Speaker 2: After I left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was after me, not before me, yeah.  But I was a student at Lake Forest when I met, first met Jesse Jackson, which is really funny.  He didn't come to the college, but, and I don't even know how this happened.  But the fraternity--what was he?  Was he an Omega [Psi Phi fraternity]?  I think he was a "Q."
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 2: And I think he was the National Vice President.  Anyway, they were doing a regional conference, and they wanted some college girls to be--help, to be hostesses.  And I don't know how they landed on the girls from Lake Forest.  Maybe because it was being held in Waukegan [Illinois], which was just north of us.  Anyway, I remember, you know, being one of the hostesses, which was wonderful. Because it meant we got to look at all these brothers.  Because remember, they only originally brought in twelve--six boys and six girls.  It wasn't like there was a whole lot of choices going on.  And Jesse Jackson, of course, was there because he was a national officer, and I remember him giving a speech.  And even back in the day, Jesse was wearing leather.  (laughter).  And I remember, you know, do you know what I mean--hanging out, you know, briefly with him then.  The world is so small.  Yeah, Lake Forest [College].  But I really was very on fire about becoming an historian.  I, you know, had fallen in love with American Studies, and I really wanted to stick with it.
Speaker 1: Had [Nathan I.] Huggins written his book about-
Speaker 2: He was working on it.
Speaker 1: --Frederick Douglass?
Speaker 2: No, no, this was before-
Speaker 1: 'Slave and Citizen[:The Life of Frederick Douglass, 1980]'?
Speaker 2: That was later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was working--really, I think it was his first book or second book, which he was polishing it back then.
Speaker 1: Was it a book about Harlem ['Harlem Renaissance', 1972], is that the one?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about Jack Sproat?   You mentioned him, but we didn't talk about what he was into.
Speaker 2: American Studies.  Again, you know, he had written several things, and just a really solid, well-respected historian who then went on to--I guess it was at the University of South Carolina I think, to head up their American Studies after he left Lake Forest [College].  I think that was in the eighties.  Jack--they were both terrific.
Speaker 1: This is an age when a discourse about, you know, black history was going on in all the history associations, and that sort of thing; a lot of tension and debate about--because the old southern schools-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were teaching about the Civil War, and Reconstruction was, like, being pushed aside by a new group.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I mean-
Speaker 2: What I loved about, you know, the way... What was happening at Lake Forest [College] was that--especially when Nate [Nathan Huggins] came--was that black history was being solidly integrated into the whole.  So, do you know what I mean?  So, that you were hearing all the stories, not just one side, which was great.
Speaker 1: I was trying to think of Sterling Stuckey.  Did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Of course, you know, when he was-
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I told you I didn't know any of those people.
Story_ID: 57661
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, alright.  So, now you were also involved in the Association of Women Students?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay, I'll put a line through that.  Because somebody put that on the outline.
Speaker 2: With the Association of Women Students?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh huh.
Speaker 2: Maybe I was, but I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there an Association of Women Students at Lake Forest [College], as you know of?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall.
Speaker 1: Well, it's probably not true (laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 2: But my memory can be very shaky about stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Had, did the African-American students organize themselves? No.  That was just beginning as I was leaving.
Speaker 2: Of course, we would have been Negroes then, Negro students.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so-
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I mean there was a lot of push and pull and, do you know what I mean, a lot of pressure.  We were putting a lot of pressure to increase, to see the numbers increase, but... yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, did you write some sort of a capstone paper for your degree in American Studies?
Speaker 1: I know I wrote a paper, but what was it about?  I don't remember what it was about.
Speaker 2: Well, can you tell us like what aspect of history and culture, in terms of America or politics, that you were most excited about?
Speaker 1: What, when I was in college?
Speaker 2: Or even if there's a couple of them, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Because I mean, it's when I was in college that I really got my, you know, started to get my feet really, really wet in understanding black history, because it wasn't being taught when I--in the schools that I had gone to--the high school--no references were made.  So, black history--you know, I was really, really moving in that direction and wanting to know more, and reading as much as I could get my hands on.  And the other thing though, was that I was equally interested in the history of Native American, Native peoples.  But you know, I mean this is why...  And I mean overall, though, it was still my, still is...  This is such a peculiar country.  And the whole of it fascinates me.  Because you know, the promises unbroken, the dreams not fulfilled, the constant sense of being a work in progress, the push and pull and the ways in which change for better and worst, you know, happened--and has happened in this country--has always fascinated me, and was the source of real fascination for me at that time.  And I was also, you know, becoming more aware too, of when and how did women factor into all of this?  But that was not as developed as it would become.  So, there was a lot (laughter) that I was interested in.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, now, did you hold any offices in the student population at Lake Forest?
Speaker 1: No, no.  Not really.
Story_ID: 57662
Speaker 1: So, would you say you were a popular student, or-
Speaker 2: Oh, I was popular.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I wasn't like, I wasn't working at it.  (laughter).  Do you know what I mean?  I really wasn't working at it because I was just, I was just fascinated.  Lake Forest [College] was like...  Though I had learned a lot, I thought about navigating in white waters.  Lake Forest [College] was like being fully immersed.  (laughter).  And it was also distinctly different waters than were, let's say in a town like Rockville Centre [New York], where in schools at least, the population was predominantly Jewish.  So, I'm becoming very knowledgeable about Jewish culture, okay, in that way.  But Lake Forest [College] was the first time, I mean, where most of the students were upper middle class.  And many--and in some cases, upper, upper--you know, and upper class, white Anglo Saxon Protestants, majority of them.  This was my first exposure to that, to that kind of preppy, that preppy thing.  It was, so it was also, you know, like hummmm, this is a different kind of white person.  So, who are these people?  I wanted to understand it.  Because I was always aware of--as how could almost one not be, growing up in the fifties [1950's] and sixties [1960's].  Do you know what I mean?  It was expected of me and of my generation of educated black folks, to become good navigators.  If we were going to keep pushing through, we had to learn how to navigate in these waters.  And so, it was like I was taking another degree in understanding what those waters were, if that makes any sense to you.
Speaker 1: It makes a lot of sense.  I mean it's the constant story from--I mean, it has been discussed from the time of Frederick Douglass to, you know, through [W.E.B] DuBois through today, you know.
Speaker 2: And I also learned that I was willing to shock people, to step on people's toes, that I could be very out-spoken.  I mean, I was considered I think something of a fire brand there because--but I didn't think--I just said what I thought was true.  Do you know what I mean?  And when you're at that age, too, when--you know, we haven't necessarily--well, some people were learned to be as politic...  you know that...  I'm just going to say what the hell I thought.
Story_ID: 57663
Speaker 1: Were there any particular campus issues that you spoke out about?
Speaker 2: I know I was very out-spoken about the need to bring more black students on the campus.  But they were always holding these conversations, do you know what I mean... about race; about you know, segregation; about the Civil Rights Movement.  There seemed to be a lot of those conversations, you know, back in that day.  And you know, and you keep hearing the same kind of earnest questioning, you know, which is almost like, "Well, tell me, you know,  like how do you know about black people?  You know, Negroes, right?"  And I so resented the idea that they, you know, that anybody would think that they could come up and ask me to tell them what all Negroes felt.  You know, it was so much like, you know, white folks going to the Indians and saying, "Take me to your leader."  So, you talk to one Indian and then you thought you knew what every Indian was about.  Oh, God.  So, I let people know what I thought about that kind of stuff.  It can get you a reputation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the other part of it was I rapidly dated every single one of those really nice Negro boys.  And I liked them, but as friends.  And I looked around, and I thought to myself, what are you going to do?  You like social life; you like having a boyfriend.  And I remember I started dating a Jewish guy on campus.  This was the first time I've ever dated someone outside of my race.  Oh, was that a scandal.  And I realized I was willing to buck what other people thought.  It's an important thing, at least it was important for me to learn that I wasn't just going to go along with what the status quo wanted me to do, you know.  So, I dated--ended up dating black guys and white guys and, big deal.  But it also was like, you know, once you break through then, you know, a lot of other people--a lot of the other girls started dating, you know, outside of the race.  Why shouldn't they?  Guys--and the guys were, too.  It was interesting.  It was an interesting time.
Speaker 1: In terms of--because you knew Nathan Huggins well, I thought I'd ask you, you know, maybe about some kind of assessment of him.
Speaker 2: As a person?
Speaker 1: Well, as an historian, because he doesn't get a lot of, you know-
Speaker 2: Play?
Speaker 1: Yeah, reflection these days.  So-
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Nathan Huggins--you know, part of it is he died too soon.  He was truly--I mean he was just an interesting thinker who brought a different sort of perspective to black history.  Because what he really--I thought his great strength was, was that he really approached it from a perspective of intellectual history; and that he was really looking to look at the intellectual streams of thought that shaped our different times and communities--whether we're talking about Harlem, whether we're looking at a Frederick Douglass, you know.  What were the intellectual forces at work?  And I think that his writing--which I think got better over time--is, was not as seductive, if you will, as some of the writings that some other historians have done in the field.  And as a result, it did not get played up as much.  But I think he was one of the towering intellects, you know, of his time, no two ways about it, and a hell of a nice man.
Story_ID: 57664
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was the world like for you when you were approaching graduation?  What was going on in the country in--I think 1966, you were-
Speaker 2: It was 1966, and people were getting angry.  Black folks started getting angry.  Young people across racial lines were angry.
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you this.  Were you tempted to go South with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], or to do any of that when you were-
Speaker 2: I must honestly say no.  I sometimes felt guilty that I did not feel that urge.  But I didn't.  I didn't think I had the temperament to be a good non-violent worker.  No, I didn't.  Uh uh, it didn't, it didn't tempt me. Did you know anybody that went down south to volunteer?  Was there a group in Lake Forest that actually did that that you know of?
Speaker 1: Not when I was there.  But even though there was... it was so interesting.  One white guy who made a decision...  Paul--I'm trying to remember Paul's last name.  But he wanted to do...  Remember there was this book called 'Black Like Me' [John Howard Griffin, 1961]  And that's--he wanted to re-create that.  So, he took these pills that was supposed to darken him, which made him look like a person with a bad case of jaundice, okay.  But anyway, and he went South and, you know, tried to pass as black--to write about it--which I thought was the weirdest... do you know what I mean?  Please.  Anyway, no.  So, to answer your question, no.  (laughter).
Speaker 2: All right, okay.  So, they had a 'Black Like Me.' You know, they made a special about the fellow that wrote that.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: On public television.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  At any rate--so you're right, the anger.  By 1966, you had riots in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and Chicago [Illinois], lots of other cities.
Story_ID: 57665
Speaker 1: You know, the big--the big debate between you know, about, you know, were you for Malcolm [X] or were you for Martin [Luther King]?  You know, all of that was there.  But-
Speaker 2: Now, Malcolm X was assassinated while you were in college.  Did, what were your, did you have a sense of what, who Malcolm [X] was?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, because it's obvious Malcolm [X] spoke to--Malcolm [X] wasn't interested in the gaze, in the sense that he wasn't interested in what white America thought of him.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And gaze, you're saying g-a-z-e.
Speaker 1: G-a-z-e.  Malcolm was interested in talking to black people about what he thought was the truth.  So, on many levels, he was like Martin Delaney from the 1900's--you know, gave no teeth for the favor in terms of that.  And at the same time, you know, I mean it was like Martin and Malcolm [X]were like the two sides of the same coin.  And in many ways that there was a Malcolm--helped, enabled the Civil Rights Movement, because for a lot of white folks, you know, Malcolm became the boogey man.  So, let me support, you know, the other one.  Whatever their reasons, it didn't matter, you know.  And I think the great sadness is that when he came back from Mecca, having broken with the Black Muslims, that, you know, that he and Martin never had that real meeting.  Because I think that, you know, Al Haj, Malik Shabazz and Martin Luther King were so much more in tune than America wanted to admit they were with each other.  And I think they knew that at the end.   I think they both knew, which is why I thought it was always so fitting--excuse me--that Betty Shabazz and Coretta Scott King became such close friends.  They knew each other.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, in '66' [1966], this is the atmosphere of riots.  There's tension.  The Black Panther Party is starting up.  And Dr. [Martin Luther] King moves to Chicago [Illinois].  This is, was this during your senior year, that Dr. [Martin Luther] King moved to Chicago?
Speaker 1: Dr. [Martin Luther] King came to Chicago, but it was after--I think I had graduated.  I think he moved there in the summer, or late spring.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the late spring of '66' [1966].
Speaker 1: And I had graduated in '66' [1966].
Story_ID: 57666
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what were your prospects like?  What were you looking at doing?
Speaker 2: I wanted to, when I graduated from college it was my goal to get a job to save some money, and then go to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because, again, I thought I was going to become an historian in American Studies.  And I looked for a job.  And I remember being offered a couple of jobs working for insurance companies in the city, and the city being New York.  I came back to New York... and looking at these great offices and these boring jobs, and thinking, "Oh, my God."  And I was about to take one, when my best friend in college, Sheryl Brinker--her mom worked for the Urban League.  And Mrs. Brinker called and said that, you know, she thought that I should apply--there was this special program at Time, Incorporated.  They were looking to recruit minorities, and she thought this would be an opportunity--you know, ideal for me.  And so, she...  [Are you saying we should stop?]  So, she suggested that I apply--gave me the name, Bill Trent--and I went to apply for a job through this program.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  We're going to pause here.
Story_ID: 57667
Speaker 1: He was a lovely man.  And God knows, contributed a great deal.  So, where are we?
Speaker 2: Are you trying to say we're ready to roll?  Alright, okay, alright.  You're going to Time Life?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So-
Speaker 1: In the fall of 1966, I got hired as a researcher trainee at Time, Incorporated.  There was a program that had been established to bring more minorities into the fold.  And Bill Trent, a very distinguished and important man, black man, had been made the head of this.  Mr. Trent had been a member of what was called [President Franklin] Roosevelt's Black Cabinet back in the day, and during the [World] War [II].  And was, you know, one of those kind of quiet heroes in terms of, you know, advancing the cause.  Such a nice man.  Anyway, I got hired as a researcher trainee in the books division.
Speaker 2: How many other young black people were hired at that time?
Speaker 1: I couldn't give you numbers--do you know what I mean?  It wasn't like a huge number that I saw.
Speaker 2: So, they didn't bring you in as a group and say, "Okay, these are the trainees", and-
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no.  That wasn't it.  So, I think it was a, you know, one by one basis.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, so I went to work in the, what was then the books division at Time, Inc., which does not exist anymore.  But, and you know, went to work over here in New York City in Midtown at the Time Life Building, which is on 50th Street and Sixth Avenue.  And researchers--again, was--because we're dealing in the sixties [1960's].  I mean, if a woman wanted to work, that was considered a great job for a girl, for a girl.  And women were girls back then.  And at Time, Inc., the hierarchy was such that the researchers were female.  The writers were male (laughter).  The--do you know what I mean?  The editors, with one or maybe two exceptions, were male, of the publications and all the books.  Women could be, maybe if they got lucky, could get to be a picture editor, but that was about it.  And I started working there in the American Library, which American Studies major.  They were doing a series of books about American culture, etc.  Perfect.  And even though I got off to a semi-rough start--I remember having a run-in with one of the editors, because I didn't, there was no real training.  When they said training, they popped you in, to see how you would do.  There was a photo of an aftermath of an event that happened when the U.S. Army surrounded a group of Lakota people that was known as Wounded Knee.  And the women and children, hundreds of them were killed.  When--I did the rough information, and I had called it "Massacre at Wounded Knee."  It moved on to the writer, who basically retyped what I had written (laughter), for more money.  The next thing I know, it had gone to one of the editors.  And this overwrought, older white man came yelling up to me at my desk, shaking this paper in my face saying, "How dare you?  How dare you?"  And I'm like, "What?"  I didn't know what he was talking about.  And then, you know--but when he finally calmed down enough to say, "How dare you call this a massacre?  This is the battle of Wounded Knee.  It's supposed to be the 'Battle' of Wounded Knee."  And I'm like, "I don't know how you can call this a battle.  Mainly women and children were killed, you know.  We call Custer's Last Stand a massacre, and this is about Army people who were wiped out with guns.  So, why are you going to, you know...?  This is a massacre."  And he kept yelling and screaming.  So, I said--I couldn't understand him.  And I was like, "Well, if that upsets you that much, why don't you change it?"  Whereupon, he flung it down and walked away.  I didn't know, and only found out--this tells you how much training was going on--that the rule was that if a copy was going to be changed, okay, after it had been moved to a certain point--it had to be done by the researcher.  So, he really wanted me to 'X' out 'massacre' and write in 'battle.'  Because if there was ever anything that had to--in case of a lawsuit or whatsoever, the researcher was the one who was in the line of fire.  I loved it.  The person at the lowest end of the totem would, you know what I mean...  And so now, you know, it was clear to me, but there was this power...  And I refused to change it to battle.  It's like, screw him.  I figured I was going to get fired.  I didn't, but it was the beginning of what I guess I'd say got me a reputation.  I mean, it's like I certainly had great allies in the books division.  The man who was the head of it, Matelin Edie, was definitely someone who thought I was really smart, and I think he just thought I was great.  The guy who was the head of the library--the particular library I worked with-- Oliver Allen who was the son of Frederick Lewis Allen--historian, relatively famous--was a big fan.  But I certainly had a number of people who were not fans, who thought that I was radical.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 57668
Speaker 1: Well, you were fairly well-read.  You had a good education at Lake Forest [College].  Because this is before the-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee' [Dee Brown, 1970] was written, and all that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you knew that history before-
Speaker 2: Well, this is--as Lewis would say, "Look, just read the facts."  Women and children, dead.  You know, who were they battling?  Come on.  Anyway, you know, and I really fell in love with book publishing.  And I pretty much said, I think I want to see what I can do with this.  I didn't rule out graduate school, but I decided it was not going to happen in the next year, you know.  I was also--you know, I remember I made a big point of when I--negotiating when I was hired that, you know, when I got to be no more trainee, that I was going to get paid ten thousand dollars a year, which seemed like an enormous amount of money, to me at least.
Speaker 1: In those days, it was pretty good.
Speaker 2: Pretty good.
Speaker 1: --for a black professional, I mean-
Speaker 2: And for a woman, a female, starting out--it was really...  So, you know, I thought let me give it a try.  And you know, in the course of working there, I also got an opportunity--because there's not a lot of us--and was sent on loan to Life Magazine.  The first time, I was sent to work with Eleanor Graves, who was one of the few female editors in the Time, Inc. empire.  And she was an editor at Life.  She was also married to the man who was the managing editor, Ralph Graves, who recently died.  I saw his obituary in the paper not too long ago.  And I was on loan with Eleanor to work on a project where she was doing something about food.  And she wanted to do a thing about soul food, or whatever.  And she sent me off with one of the Life photographers down to a family, black family, in South Carolina--you know, to you know, partake of and capture, you know, soul food.  Quite frankly, the woman who we covered--I thought her food--I would--it was like, uh uhhhhh.  It was really wasn't, but they didn't ask my opinion, do you know what I mean?  I don't like, I wouldn't eat this stuff.  (laughter).  You know, just because we're black, don't mean we can all cook.  But you know, Eleanor was pleased with the results or whatever, and it was like a short-term thing, you know.  It was like, on loan for like a week or so, to do that.  And then the next thing I knew I was brought, asked to come to Life again on loan to work--because I guess it was like 1968--on a series, on a special that they were going to be doing about the new black leaders.  Martin was dead--that would have been '68' [1968], yes, '68' [1968], '69' [1969]--'68' [1968]...  The up and coming black leaders...  And my job was that I was suddenly turned into--what I call it, the black brand star.  I was sent off to do a lot of the interviews of these guys.  And the guys I remembered was like Jesse Jackson, Julian Bond, Harry Edwards, Ron Karenga, Cleage--Reverend Cleage-
Speaker 1: Albert Cleage?
Story_ID: 57669
Speaker 1: Uh huh, I interviewed him.  There was this man who I didn't quite understand why he was included.  I'm trying to remember.  There were a couple of others.  But those were the highlights, you know, those were the ones that I interviewed.  And so, I spent several weeks, you know, flying around to interview my brothers.  And I remember going out to Chicago and, you know, to interview Jesse Jackson--never imagining that Jesse was going to remember me, which he did which was so sweet.  And I remember him taking me home with him and, you know, meeting the family or whatever, you know, interviewing him.  And interviewing Julian [Bond] on the plane.  I forgot--and he was going someplace...  and going up to, at the Cud (ph), to interview, you know, Harry [Edwards], Marsha and the guys.  It was fascinating.  We got all the interviews done.  You know, the editor of the project, you know, was pleased with the interviews.  And in coming up with the list of who were these people going to be--included in the list was Eldridge Cleaver.  Think about the times, right.
Speaker 2: This was about the time that "Soul on Ice" [1968] was coming out?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.  And there was a--the conference room where, you know, they would display--glass, you know. This special section was, you know, completed per se, and this photo essay that I, you know, had been working on, you know.  And Ralph [Earl] Graves came in to look, to review it.  And he's walking down, walking along the wall.  And the editor is explaining--and then they come to the photograph of Eldridge Cleaver.  Graves went ballistic.  "We're not having a convicted rapist in Life Magazine.  You know, "How dare you?"  Blah, blah, you know.  "He's nobody's leader, he's no new spokesperson."  Blah, blah.  "He's a convicted rapist", or whatever, you know.  And the next thing I know, everybody is looking at me.  The editor's looking at me.  It's like it was if I was the only one who thought that, you know, Cleaver should be part of it.  And I finally said, "Look, I don't like that he's a convicted rapist.  So, that does not necessarily mean that therefore he is not a spokesperson or a leader."  You know, I said, "We have had leaders of nations who have done worse", you know.  "And it is not up to you to tell black people who they should follow.  That's not who you, that's not your place either, Mr. Graves", you know.  "And there are a lot of black people in this country who consider him to be a legitimate voice for their concerns.  I thought he was going to have an apoplectic fit.  And then he, you know, he yelled some more.  And I said, "Look, Dr. Franklin, John Hope Franklin, was supposed to be the advisor on this, this thing that they were doing."  I said, I said, "So, why don't you ask, speak to Dr. Franklin?  You know, who am I?  I'm a nobody.  Ask Dr. Franklin, you know, what his opinion is."  And I remember Graves stormed out of the room or whatever.  The editor I remember said to me, "Well, dear, you know, if you had thought that maybe there was going to be a job for you at Life Magazine, I think you can forget it."  It was true.  You know, I thought that I was really was going to get to be a reporter there.  But after that incident, I knew I was mud.  The upshot was Graves talked to Dr. Franklin, and Dr. Franklin told him almost essentially what I'd said.  And so, the compromise was that he insisted that we put--I think it was like Whitney Young--into the mix, which was insulting to Whitney Young.  But you know what I mean, because-
Speaker 2: He was (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) Thank you.  But anyway, and so I went back to the books division a bit chastised.  And what I ended up--then working on a black history book that they were doing.
Story_ID: 57670
Speaker 1: Was this one of the Time Life book series?
Speaker 2: Yes, but this was not a series.  Everything else that Time Life did during that period of books was always a series.  They did "a" black history book.  So, this was a token.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was happy to work on.  The editor gave me a lot of leeway, so that I was actually doing much more than being a researcher, because my title hadn't changed.  I was really serving as picture editor.  I gathered pictures and worked on the captions and, do you know what I mean--had a lot of input to what was coming out.  And again, you know, Dr. [John Hope] Franklin was involved with this project.  He wrote most of it.  I spent a lot of time with him, how wonderful.  And when it was all said and done, you know, I then said...  Oh, the editor said, "Well, we want to acknowledge what you, you know, your contributions and stuff."  I said "Fine."  And, you know, I fully expected that they were going to name me as the picture editor of that book.  Instead, they came up with this completely different thing.  And they wanted to put me on the mast head as "Pictures: [colon], Marcia Ann Gillespie."  Pictures, not picture editor.  Get it?  Because if they give me picture editor, it would be a real job, right.  And I remember saying to the head of the books division--because the man who had been there when I first came in, had retired:  "So, did I take them, or did I pose for them?"  And he was like, "Well, you know we're trying to..."  I said, "What you're trying to do is not acknowledge what I actually did.  And, you know, I don't accept it.  I'm a researcher.  I'm proud of being a researcher.  Put my name down as researcher, if you're not going to name me as picture editor, which you really should."  And that's when I knew my days at Time Life [Incorporated] were done.  The head of the books division really did not like me.  He had made it known that he thought that I was a troublemaker through one of his little hench people, who told me that they thought I had helped to set back the cause of civil rights by fifty years, because nothing was ever good enough for me.  The books division was moving.  They were gong to move to the Washington, D.C. area, and I didn't want to go.  But I also knew that I wasn't really going to be asked.  I interviewed for other positions within the company, but nothing came through.  And I realized I was at, I was really at the end of my rope.  And that's when I remember my good friend Toni Parks[-Parsons], who I had met--she worked briefly at Time, Inc., Gordon Parks' daughter.  And I remember calling, you know, Toni, you know, and saying "Toni, I need to talk to your dad."  I mean, I'd seen him in the halls and stuff, but I really didn't know him well, because Essence had started by then.  It was 1970, had just started.  And I had actually crashed the party, because they had a large party for the magazine.  I had been at Time, Inc. and was really quite hurt, because I had actually--you know, when they were first thinking about Essence Magazine, the founders were going around interviewing black women who were in the business in some way.  And I had had lunch with Clarence Smith, you know, who was asking--when they still thinking about calling the magazine Sapphire.  Oh, God.  That was what they were considering.  And they were, you know, talking to varying people--you know, women in business about--you know, what kind of magazine would they like to see, etc.  And I remember at that lunch when, you know, when he had talked about Sapphire, and I told him, "Oh, bad idea."  But then, you know, by the end of it he was asking well, if there's something I thought I could do at the magazine.  And quite frankly, I didn't think so.  I think I had met him through, it would have been in the summer of '69' [1969] when they were doing those interviews.  And so, but by 1970 I could see that, you know, I was out of options.  I didn't know where I was going to get my next job.  And I knew that Gordon [Parks] was involved with Essence, that he was, you know, the creative director.  So, I asked Toni if she would put in a word for me with her dad.  And Gordon [Parks] invited me over to his apartment to meet with me.  And I remember we had a long chat.  Oh, nice man, nice man, so elegant.  We talked about everything.  We talked about politics, we talked about the magazine, we talked about our experiences at Time, Inc.  And Gordon [Parks] kind of mumbled--you know...  But the upshot was, you know, he said he wanted me to meet the people at Essence.  And I was then set up with an appointment with Ida Lewis who was then the editor-in-chief, because they were looking to hire a managing editor.  And even though I didn't have any managing editor experience, one of the things that they were doing was there was a woman by the name of Barbara Kerr--a white woman who had worked at a number of women's magazines--who was there to help train people, because magazine publishing was so segregated.  There were very few African-Americans--female, male--working in magazine publishing, mainstream.  So, they didn't have a big pool to pick from.  And so, she was there to help train people.  And unbeknownst to me at the time, I'd also come highly recommended by Eleanor Graves.  And so, I got hired to become the managing editor, with the understanding that Barbara Kerr was going to be working with me to train me.  And that's how I got to Essence in 1970.  I went to work there in November, and by January I had, no longer needed Barbara Kerr.  I figured out to be a managing editor, how to make the train run on time.  I discovered--which I knew pretty much from the work I'd done on the black history book, that I had a good feel for editing copy, that I had, I knew I had a strong visual eye-
Story_ID: 57671
Speaker 1: Oh, I know I had a really good feel for editing.  I learned that working on the black history book.  I knew that--and I knew it even before, as a researcher, because it seemed to me everything I wrote only got copied.  So, I knew that I had a way with the words.  I also knew I had a very strong visual eye, from my work at Time, Inc.--both at Life Magazine and on the black history book, in particular.  I was 26, actually 25 when I was there.  But, and I was also, you know, very full of myself, as only you can be at a certain age in your life where, you know, you think you can climb any mountain.  And they just like, get you started until you can make it.  So, I guess I had been there--by the end of the winter, I was really quite convinced that I really should be the editor-in-chief; that I knew what that magazine needed, and that it wasn't happening.  It just wasn't coming together.  It wasn't, it wasn't happening.  And the numbers proved to me to be right, though I didn't know all that.  And I remember that, you know, it was--I knew that Ida [Lewis] was really getting sick of me.  I knew that about the time--I remember that Susan Taylor came in to be interviewed to become the beauty editor.  And I remember when she was walking down the stairs.  We were working in this ramshackled townhouse on the East, in the East 30's in New York City.  And the edit--you know, we were in the basement in a ramshackle...  And Susan [Taylor] came down.  And I remember looking at her and thinking, she looks like a beauty editor.  And Ida was running late, and Susan and I were just sitting at my desk, which was outside of Ida [Lewis]'s office.  And we just chatted and we were hitting it off really well.  She went in.  I wished her luck.  I remember after the interview with Ida [Lewis], Ida then called me into her office and said, "Well, I know you talked to her.  What did you think of her?"  And I knew that if I said I thought she was terrific, I had a feeling Ida wouldn't hire her.  So, I kind of went, "Oh, I thought she was okay", really thinking that she would be terrific.  But you know, one thing--you know, but I just disagreed with a lot of Ida [Lewis]'s editorial decisions.  And we were getting like--it was like oil and water.  We weren't mixing.
Speaker 2: Now, I don't know.  I probably should know.  But Ida--was she related to Ed Lewis?
Speaker 1: No, they were not related.
Speaker 2: Not related at all?
Story_ID: 57672
Speaker 1: They were not related.  And to make a long story short, Ida [Lewis] fired me for insubordination and incompetence.  I wasn't, I was insubordinate.  I was never incompetent, that I was clear about.  But anyway, she fired me.  And unfortunately, around the time all of this happened--or fortunately--as far as I was concerned, the partners at Essence got involved in a tug of war about who was going to have the power--Jonathan Blount or Ed Lewis.  And Ida [Lewis] backed the wrong horse.  She backed Jonathan.  I could have told her that was the wrong horse, but being it as it may...  And so, within a very short period of time--and I mean this happened within weeks--less than two weeks I think-Ida [Lewis] was gone and they were asking me to come back to--as the managing editor--while they--you know, to keep the ship going while they searched for a new editor-in-chief.  But I'm like, to myself, I want to be the editor-in-chief.  And so, I remember going home and writing this, my statement, my vision mission for the magazine, and presenting it to Ed [Lewis] and to Clarence [Smith] and to Cecil Hollingsworth, the three remaining partners--and telling them that I wanted to be considered.  And basically being told that they thought I was a little too brash and too young.  This is from guys who, you know--I think Clarence [Smith] was the oldest.  He was maybe ten years older than I am.  But no one was like, you know...  And they proceeded to keep interviewing other people.  And I'm putting out the magazine.  So, one day I moved into the editor-in-chief's office (laughter) and decided to just stake my claim.  And I don't know if they had, you know, decided that nobody else really fit the bill and so, what the hell--or whether they were just so shocked.  But what they ended up doing was they gave me an opportunity to be the editor--not in chief... and just on trial... and see if, you know, if I could do it, and would the in-chief come?  So, that's how I became the editor of the magazine in 1971.
Speaker 2: Did you seek any advice before you made that move, or did you just, you just did it?
Speaker 1: No, I did.  I knew in my gut what that magazine should be.  I knew it like I knew my name.  I knew what I, you know...  And who would I have talked to, really, about, you know what I mean, in terms of...?  It wasn't like there was...  You know, people who either told me I was crazy or...  But you know, the one thing, you know, my maternal grandmother used to always tell me is nothing beats a--but a try.  So, you know, what did I have to lose?  It turned out, nothing.  So, you know, just before, you know, my twenty-sixth birthday, I became the editor-in-chief.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, tell us a little bit about the magazine.  What was it like before you, you know, joined, and...  Well, we have to pause here.  We'll pause here and then we'll talk about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 57673
Speaker 1: You'd asked me a question.
Speaker 2: Yes, we're rolling again.  Tell us what the magazine was like before you started, and what your vision for Essence was.
Speaker 1: I thought when the magazine got started, it was, it clearly was trying to portray an elegance, you know, black female elegance.  But I wasn't quite sure up to what purpose.  And it wasn't really clear who the magazine was talking to.  By that 'who' I mean, yeah, black women--but who?  What's the mindset?  And it seemed to me that Essence hadn't figured that out--didn't seem to know that, you know.  So, I remember they were doing--and they were doing some fascinating stuff.  You know, when they would send a fashion team to Paris [France]--that was great.  But what I meant what we looked like; what's the style now for here and for...?  Is that what she really wants?  And who's that woman?  Is that who we should be pitching the magazine to, especially at the beginning?  I had a mindset in mind.  I called it--you know--I mean I knew that for advertising, you have to talk about, you know, income and bup, bup, bup (ph).  But if you looked at the black female income at that time, they were such a small percentage of folk who were in the middle income bracket.  That wasn't what it was about.  I had to lower that.  And it wasn't for me about income, it was state of mind.  And I talked about I wanted a magazine that appealed to--I called it the "striver" group.  And by striver, I meant people who--the people like the people I came from, who know they wanted better and more, and some more after that--who would...  You know, I wanted Essence...  I remember, and I used these words:  "inspiration, information, and affirmation".  Those are the things I thought were really important--that we needed to affirm who we were, because there was so little of that in the world.  I wanted the magazine to feel like an extension of the kitchen table.  Because in my world, at least, the kitchen tables were where I always thought women gathered.  You know, it was the way I grew up.  It's where, you know, women gathered.  They were in the kitchen cooking, talking, bup bup bup (ph).  You know, and you got--women would get to, really to the nitty gritty when they were in the kitchen.  You know, because it was like unvarnished.  They were often uncensored, because it wasn't about the men.  Do you know what I mean?  It was just about women talking.  And I wanted the magazine to have that kind of conversational feeling--that we were women talking.  I wouldn't have been able to characterize it at the time, because I certainly didn't have that language.  But what I was striving for was a publication free of the gaze.  As of now, I've come to think of it as a result of, you know, Toni Morrison explain her writing in that way.  It wasn't about what white people thought about this black woman's magazine, it was about what black women felt about it.  And even though I loved that, you know, as the magazine grew--and we grew by leaps and bounds in the seventies [1970's] once we began to get our groove on--that, you know, there were a lot of black men who read the magazine, but they weren't my interest.  Because it wasn't theirs, this was supposed to be for us.  I mean, some of the arguments I would have with the founders who, you know, when they would have comments about...  I'm like, "This isn't about you.  You know, this is not about you."  I mean, I was clear about that.  And what I also loved is that we were all learning together--people on the staff and the other editors and I.  You know, I'd never been an editor-in-chief before.  I didn't know what I was really doing.  I was making it up as I went along.  Susan [Taylor] had never been a beauty editor before but, you know, hey.  And then when the publisher fired my fashion editor one day when I was out sick because she worked his last nerve, I was ready to fire him if I could have.  You know, I turned to Susan, and I said "I want you to be the fashion editor."  And again, it was like, "Who, me?  I don't like..."  But I'm like, "You've great style, I think you can do it."  What we were doing was--and I hope I helped encourage it--was saying to people, you know, we don't know what we can do because we've never been given a chance to fly.  So, let's try it.  The worst you can do is you mess up.  You can go back to being a beauty editor.  You know what I mean?
Story_ID: 57674
Speaker 1: So, I was hiring people who didn't necessarily come with a long list of credentials, but who brought something.  Maybe it was an eye, or something that made me feel... "Let's give it a shot, let's see what can happen."  If they hadn't, you know, done it with me, would I have ever gotten there?  I don't think so.  So, you know, the wonderful thing was the way the community responded, the way my sisters responded.  Even though, you know, I mean I look at some of those early issues and I cringe.  You know, it's like, "Oh, my God, this was really bad."  Oh, you know, but--and my aunt, my oldest aunt, Aunt Violet who was the reader...  You know, I remember, you know, because I had been editor for a couple of, several months.  Maybe it was almost like six months.  And she said to me, "Well, you know, Baby, it's not bad.  But you know, this magazine isn't a cup of coffee magazine."  I'm like, "I beg your pardon?"  She said, "I can finish this magazine and still not finish, have finished my cup of coffee."  Because it was so thin, we didn't have much advertising.  She said, "You know, you got to make this more than a cup of coffee."  Boy, I was like hurt, you know.  But I can recall when, you know, we started--the advertising started to build and, you know, I was also getting a wider range of writing and writers in there.  I remember saying to her, "So, you still can't finish the coffee?  Did you finish the coffee before the magazine?"  She was like, "Baby, I had to have two cups.  So, then now I even had a little more reading to do."  I was like, well, okay, you must be on to it.  But what I really loved was that people took ownership.  People would write to me, tell me what they wanted, what they thought, what they felt was wrong, what they felt we needed to better.  It was pretty amazing.
Story_ID: 57675
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about the regular departments in Essence.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean they had all the departments basically that one would find in a woman's magazine.  Of course, there was fashion and beauty.  And I must make, you know, a point here--especially about the beauty.  That beauty was an essential.  We did a special beauty issue every year, and that was essential.  Black women were not told that we were beautiful.  America didn't tell black women they were beautiful.  You know, it was up to the Ebonys and the Jets and Essence to do that.  But even with the Ebonys and the Jets, they would often talk about us being sultry.   And I mean, there was this language that would be used about black women.  Do you know what I mean--sultry and...  Why did we have to be sultry?  Why can't we just damn well be beautiful?  And the emphasis for me also was in making sure that no child or no little girl was going to pick up a copy of her mama's Essence and not think that she was beautiful--and that it was incumbent upon us to show a range of beauty, a range of color.  Because we were still--you know, people who believed in that paper bag--that, you know, if you were a certain shade, you were fine.  But when you started to move darker than that shade, well I'm not so sure.  You know, it was incumbent upon Essence to make sure that those covers weren't just the light... you know, I want to call it the light skinned brown girl; that they weren't just the girl with the long hair.  You know, because that was so much of what had constricted and done, God knows, how much harm to so many black women's self-esteem, you know, for way too long.  And Essence couldn't be that.  So, our beauty department, our beauty section, was central and very important and very big in the magazine.  But we did, you know, home and design and recipes and money.  You know, there was always a money column and advice column, unlike a lot of women's magazines that were slowly just getting hip to the fact that women worked.  We knew women worked.  We'd come from people who--that's why we were here.  You know, so it was about career.  You know, there was a career column, a column about money and finance, because these were essentials.  There was an education column because, again, that was an essential.  We knew if you want access, if you're trying to take another step, these are the things you need.  Those became bread and butter.  But we were also writing about culture.  There was a culture column--history--because we were still a people learning about who we were.  So, all of that was part of the regular mix--you know, mothering.  Essence was the go-to place for all the information that we felt that women needed or wanted.  We did sex, relationships, you name it.  Spirituality...  And the complex things that make women and black women so unique.
Speaker 1: Essence also tried to link the generations.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean even though all women's magazines are supposed to, were supposed to--only a few of them appealed to the eighteen to thirty-five, because those were the advertisers.  I think they--which is still the same thing today.  You know, again, I don't care about that.  And I was happy that we ran the gamut from eighteen on up; that it was a mother-daughter magazine, and sometimes a mother-daughter-grandmother magazine; that people felt that there was a place for them, regardless of age, in that mix.  That was wonderful.
Story_ID: 57676
Speaker 1: Was there a, in terms of health--I mean, the beauty issue.  I know in late--Essence starts in 1970.
Speaker 2: It started in 1970, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And that's like the, that's like the late stage of the black arts movement in a lot of ways.  And you've got people wearing the natural hair styles and other--you know, African garments and that sort of thing became popular.  Was there a--well, the cosmetics industry makes a lot of products to straighten out your hair and to change your appearance, you know--lighten skin and all of that.  Was there, did you have tension in terms of the advertising--the pictures and stuff for Essence?
Speaker 2: Well, I, you know, I mean it was like one of the things I remember screaming and yelling about, was I didn't want to see skin lightening products.  And never did we recommend skin lightening products.  You know, they would buy ads, but they got stuck in the back of the magazine.  But no, you know--yes, you know what I mean, you know, there were plenty of ads for hair straighteners.  But they were also going to make a lot of editorial that was about natural hair, because we featured both natural hair and straight hair.  It wasn't our job, I felt, to dictate to black women--do this, or don't do that.  What I wanted us to do was to show the possibilities and the range.  So, if you want to straighten your hair, here's a great look.  If you want a natural, here's a great look.  Never, you know--never quite imagining, you know, that there would be the time that we are in now where, you know, it's like to see natural hair slowly beginning to re-emerge, which makes me so sad.  Because, you know, I mean this idea that, you know, we have been further brainwashed about what beauty is, instead of having it continue to expand.  But the cosmetics people--you know, of course we, you know, again, I don't tell people to wear makeup or not wear makeup.  There were readers who objected to the fact that, you know, that women wore makeup.  Women wear makeup.  Get over it.  You know, if you don't want to wear it, you don't have to.  But that really wasn't, I think, the biggest push and pull.  I think one of the--you know, our biggest push and pull back for so long was really to convince advertisers that black women made decisions about their money.  And that black women--do you know what I mean--weren't waiting for a man to tell them how to do things, so... that, you know, black women bought cars.  Do you know what I mean?  That black women made major purchases.  This was, and this was before, you know, the women's movement had really caught steam that they...  So, we were really moving ahead of the times, in terms of trying to, you know, get it across that black women went on vacations with other women, and made decisions about that; and bought plane tickets and, you know, was staying in hotels; visited places.  So, all of that--you know, building a tourist business--the tourist business in the magazine.  Our challenge was really just to get the advertisers into the door, which meant that we were constantly educating Americans and a lot of white businesses about who we were.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have to turn down any ads?
Speaker 2: I recall, I think--and I hope this is true.  There was a company, and it was about their politics.  But I'm not going to--I can't--the name of the company does not jump out at me at this time, so I'm not going to say.
Story_ID: 57677
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Do you have a favorite issue?
Speaker 2: Of the magazine, from when I was there?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, do I have a favorite?
Speaker 1: Or what are some of your favorites?  We'll ask it like that, so you don't have to-
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's funny.  I have covers that stand out.  I loved--I loved the black love covers that we did--you know, every February at least--and a little bit more than that.  I loved the celebration...  Oh, sorry...
Speaker 1: Can you say that again?
Speaker 2: I loved the covers that we did.  I loved--especially the ones celebrating black love, black couples.  I loved the ones with fathers and daughters that we did with, you know, the families.  Again, because, you know, this is all very deliberate in many ways, because it was about approaching the stereotypes.  You know, all those stereotypes that get denigrated and denied--that we love each other, that we build families, that we have great relationships, that fathers are there for their children, you know, all of those things.  You know, I think about them because they were issues that we did about mothers and about fathering, that were wonderful to read, but they were also statements.  You know, putting pins into all of those ugly stereotypes about who we are.  I loved the fact that we put pregnant women on the cover way before pregnant women were being put on covers of women's magazines, or magazines period.  I loved the fact--and they're not issues per se, they're just things that step out for me.  I loved the fiction that we ran in the magazine.  Maybe in part--I mean, I loved it so much because I also got to be the fiction editor, because their staff was always so small.  So, you know, I would take home the slush piles--we called them slush piles.  You know, stuff that comes in that you haven't asked for--and read through the fiction.  I came across some extraordinary pieces, including one that we ran and won the National Magazine Award for Fiction, by a sister named Hortense Spillers.  And it was a piece called "The Ism's."  God, my memory does hold for some things.  I loved that, you know, we published Terry McMillan, you know, way back.  I loved that readers, you know, looked forward to the fiction and to the poetry.  I loved that we could, had always ran a lot of poetry in the magazine.  I also loved the range of writers, you know, who wrote there.  But did I have one issue over any of the others?  I always loved our anniversary issues.  No, it's not like I loved this one more than I loved any, you know, another one.  No, nothing like that.
Story_ID: 57678
Speaker 1: What was the biggest challenge of being the Editor-in-Chief of Essence?
Speaker 2: Never enough time, never enough time.  Because getting, you know, never having--the staff was too small, you know.  And it grew during my tenure, but there just never seemed to be enough hours in the day to get, you know, everything done.  I think, too, it was also the fact that there were all these different segments who were, you know, busy trying to tell me what they thought that still what the magazine ought to be.  And that's their right and their privilege, you know.  And there was this kind of relentlessness in some quarters to try to upscale--you know, upscale the magazine, upscale it.  I didn't know quite what they meant by that, except-
Speaker 1: Somebody actually published a magazine called Upscale.
Speaker 2: --yeah, you know, like have more expensive clothes.  I wanted things that people could afford.  And it worried me when prices went too high, you know what I mean--even though the style... [sound of siren].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, you asked me what were some of the hardest things--you know, and I'm still giving it the push and pull.  I didn't want Essence to be a magazine that was only going to appeal to one clique.  I wasn't interested in that.  But there was also--there were always people who tried to push you when they felt the magazine wasn't black enough; or who thought it wasn't middle-classed enough; or upper-classed enough or, you know.  And sometimes I would--you know, there were times when I wanted to go, "Oh, enough, already," because you can't please everybody, you know.  It was frustrating to me that, you know, the magazine could have been at a million before I left.  And it was--the circulation was deliberately suppressed.
Story_ID: 57679
Speaker 1: How?
Speaker 2: Because it--the numbers could have grown, could easily have grown, but it would have affected the income of the readership.  And that would have affected advertising.  But it would--the fear was that if it grew too fast, the readers--you know, we were bringing--the readers' income levels might drop; that the income level of readers might drop, and that that would have a negative effect on advertising.  And so, you know, by the time I'd been there in what, 1980, we were over seven hundred and fifty thousand.  We could have been over a million at that point, could have been there.  And, I mean you have to understand for me that meant--that was important.  Because when I took--when I became the editor-in-chief the magazine was way under fifty thousand in circulation, way under.  They never really told me--I think it was about twenty-something thousand.  And it was floundering.  And so, you know, one of the ways is, if you're an editor-in-chief that you know you're hitting it, is when the circulation continues to grow.  So, you know, knowing that Essence was--became the fastest growing woman's magazine in America during that period--was a real enforcement of the fact for me that I was doing the right thing.  And I make no bones about it--I was a numbers driven editor-in-chief.  I wanted to see this magazine not just survive, but I wanted it to thrive.  And I know that part of the way is you build the numbers.  You build the numbers.  And I didn't want to pander to my reader, but I wanted us to see this magazine get big.  And it did.  I mean seven hundred and fifty thousand was very respectable, though it could have been at a million.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: And that's a very--yeah, that's something to think about.  I never would have guessed that they wanted to repress the circulation.
Speaker 2: They had to, they felt they had to.  I'm not disagreeing with them.  I mean, because the advertising--the strictures of advertising...  You know, those guys on Madison Avenue, they didn't understand the fact that--you know, when you come from people who know how to make a penny kiss its behind, on paper you would have to say, "So, how do they do any of the things that they do?"  And I know that, you know--on paper we have to say, how does a woman who cleans houses and a man who fixes televisions afford to send their children to college?  They do it.  They make decisions.  They didn't understand that that didn't mean that people who didn't make this number--whatever the magic, you know, income number was--were still going to go out and buy televisions, were still going, you know--doing all the things that the rest of America did.  They didn't get us.  You know, and this is even before, you know, credit cards had come in really big.  So, there was, you know, this need therefore to convince advertising.  And that meant that we had to be conscious of what the numbers looked like at all times.  Yeah, Essence...  Essence... an extraordinary place.  I got to meet the most amazing people and to work with them--but to meet people.  Oh, and to get such positive feedback--you know, black entertainers who I had admired, you know, from afar who were so supportive and so receptive to this magazine for black women.  I never recall any black celebrity turning us down, whether it was about being on the cover...  And in part, one of the things--of course, it seems strange to think about it now.  But back in the day, we did not put celebrities on the cover that often.  I was not interested in making it an Ebony.  That was Ebony's job.  Our job was supposed to be celebrating black women.  And so, therefore, we used a lot of people who weren't famous.  We used models, but we used a lot of women who weren't models--literally, women we found on the streets, walking down the street.  (laughter).  So, it was a big deal when you, when a celebrity got asked to be on our cover.  And they treated it like it was a big deal.  And I remember Susan [Taylor] and I would, you know, like sometimes, you know, end up arguing because I'd be like, "No, I'm not putting her on the cover.  I don't want to put that celebrity, I want to do..."  You know, and it bothers me today that we're so celebrity driven that all women's magazines now are that way.  But, you know, it bothers me for black people.  Because what happens when you're dealing with a woman's magazine is, what makes people celebrity or movie actresses, etc.?  There's a look that is being sold, whether you're a singer or this--there's a look.  That look is a box.  It's a box for black women, because it says you got to have hair--somebody's hair.  It's going to come down to here.  You got to have--you know, you're usually going to be about a certain shade, and not too much darker.  You're going to have to have certain kinds of features, because that's what the camera likes.  But is that all to black beauty?  Hell, no.
