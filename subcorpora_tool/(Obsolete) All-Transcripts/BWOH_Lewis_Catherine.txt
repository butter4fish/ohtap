Marcia Greenlee:	This is an interview with Mrs.
Catherine Cardozo Lewis. The interviewer is Marcia Greenlee, and the interview is taking place in Mrs. Lewis's home, 1631 Webster Street, Northeast, Washington, D.C., 20017. The date is September 12, 1980. Mrs. Lewis, would you tell us something about your work experience, what your career has been through the years?
Catherine Lewis:	Well, my work experience has not
been too varied. But, oh, I would say, back in the early forties, maybe the late thirties, my husband and I decided that the only way that we could send our son to the college that he wanted to go to, was for me to go to work. And I took a course to enable me to pass a government examination and qualify for civil service. And at that time, I did qualify. One of the things that struck me at that time—the fairness or unfairness of life, as you might call it—is that my score, which is really of no great distinction whatsoever, was ninety-eight percent. But I was told that because I was a resident of the district, my chance of being hired would be after everybody in the various and sundry forty-eight states at that time, was hired. Then I would get a chance at employment. But fortunately, my husband had a brother who lived in Richmond, and he was able to use political influence. I suppose that just shouldn't even be revealed now. And I got hired in the Census Bureau.
As a result of that, I was... I was in the card punch division, and I joined the union, which was not a popular thing at that time. But I was...I suppose I would consider myself a liberal even at that time, and I﻿2
CL: (cont.) thought, I felt that the union, unionism was a good thing. As it turned out for me personally, it was, because I got bursitis in my arm, and that was an occupational hazard for card-punch operators. If you got that bursitis, you were simply discarded, you were on the discard heap. But with the union, the union went to bat for its members, and as a result, I was transferred to a clerical division, where I didn't have to use my arm. And so I worked in the union. I got up to the... I was beginning to rise in the union. And then, as a result of that, they transferred me back and forth, and each time, as far as I was concerned, each time I was transferred, it was to a more interesting job.
MG: Were you being transferred because of your union involvement?
CL: Well, both, I suppose, because of my union involvement and because of
the fact that I was able to do the really minor clerical jobs that were given me very easily.
Another one of the interesting jobs that I had was what they call title search. At that time, they were trying to find a proof of birth of anybody who was being employed in the government service in the war effort. Because by that time—you see, it was about 1939, and the war effort was just beginning to start, and they were looking, they were trying to find everybody they could find. Sometimes the only way that they could get any proof of birth was to go back and search old census records, which is way, way down in the basement. And there were these huge volumes of census records, evidently original census records, and that was one of the things that we were supposed to do. Well, I found that very interesting because the people from... Well, really they moved from place to place. It's really amazing the way people, Americans, always move from place to place. One census, you would find them in one state. In the next census, you would find them in a completely different state. And if they remembered that they lived in a certain state at that time, it was possible to find them. So that they were able to... They were hired on the basis of being found in at least two census records. And then later, I was transferred to a division where these records were transcribed and eventually sent on, so that they were eventually hired.
Unfortunately at that particular time, I contracted tuberculosis and I had to give up my j.ob. So for fourteen months, I was in the hospital. And then, when I came out, my doctor recommended that I do some volunteer work in the neighborhood in order to keep me from... I was a worrywart. So in order to keep me from worrying about my condition, he recommended that I do some volunteer work, and I did that. I joined the Civic Association, and at the time, out there where we
lived__we lived with my husband's mother out in Southeast—they were
just beginning to start a Rochdale Co-op out there. It had been a buying club, but it had gotten tremendous response so they, Rochdale decided, the cooperative, which at that time was located on Fourteenth Street, their headquarters, decided that they would try to see if they could get a store. I don't know whether it's important or not, but the cooperative movement, oh, I would think since the first part of﻿3
CL: (cont.) the century, has waxed and waned in the United States. And at that particular time, it was very popular because the liberals in the...among the new government workers were people who were interested in that phase of the movement, liberal movement, and most of them joined the cooperative clubs, groups, and we had some out our way. And I finally became secretary of the co-op, and at the same time, I became the secretary of the citizens' group out there.
MG: What was the name of the citizens' group?
CL: Garfield Heights Civic Association. No, I'm sorry, it was always
called Citizens' Association. At that time, the civic association...I mean, the Negro and the white associations were supposed to be differentiated by being called, [whites] were called Citizens' Association. And Negroes were called Civic. But my husband's father, who founded the Garfield Heights Citizens' Association, refused to be called Civic Association. He always called that organization a citizens' association, so that's what it was.
MG: What was your father-in-law's name? The man out front there.
CL: William H. Lewis. He was in the quartermaster department in the navy yard for the government. And he was also a lawyer. He was very, very well respected in his community. He and his wife both were well respected in the community and for...oh, until the time of his death, he was president of the Citizens' Association. Well, to make a long story short, after I had done work in the Citizens' Association, and as well as the cooperative organization that was called... It's still called Rochdale.
MG: It's still in existence?
CL: It's not a Rochdale. It's a cooperative, but it's not a Rochdale. And it's not here; it's in Greenbelt [Maryland]. And I became so involved in both of these organizations, that I ended up really... Well, mainly because I didn't have any responsibility, I had very little responsibility at home since I was living with my mother-in-law, and she was practically running the home so that I didn't have too much to do at home. I found that I was working anywhere from six to eight hours a day. And after I had done that for about a year and a half, well, maybe two years, it suddenly occurred to me that if I could do volunteer work like that, I ought to be able to do work for pay. And especially, as I said, at that time, we decided that che only way that my son could go to the college of his choice, which was Purdue in Indiana, [was] that I would have to go to work. Because even though my husband was teaching at Howard, his salary at Howard was—as most of the instructors there—notoriously low. So I started working for the co-op as a paid employee in the office, which was a very good chance for me because I was under a very efficient but understanding office manager. And he taught me the rudiments of bookkeeping, which stood me in good stead when I worked, when I started working at the Cardozo Sisters. I worked there for about a year and a half.﻿4
CL: (cont.) But unfortunately at that time, the situation began to change. The war was over, and the liberals began to look under every bed for Communists. And they began to... And anybody who was a little too outspoken—and I have always, all my life, I have been outspoken. I guess 1 would consider myself a maverick all of my life, because I have never gone along with the crowd. I've never thought that because somebody else did it, I should do it. And at that time, the cooperative decided along with everybody else that they needed to look at everybody who did not speak and think the way they did with a suspicious eye. And that broke up the cooperative movement here, as far as I could see. It broke it up. And then of course, at that time, the store out in Southeast, they had opened a store and they went through all the ceremonies of opening a store, but for some reason or other, it just didn't work. So as a result of that... because I felt that if they had given a little bit more attention to the store, it might have. But then I think the economics of supermarkets was that you had to have... In order to pay for itself, the store had to be a certain size, and that was not the proper size; nor was the store on Fourteenth Street, where the office was. And that was also the beginning of the white flight to the suburbs.
MG: What time period are we talking about?
CK: We're talking about 1948. Also at that time, you know, the liberals were... It was the beginning of the ADA [Americans for Democratic Action]. I represented the co-op in the ADA. And I found another thing very interesting, because they were doing all this soul searching as to whether or not they should have a third party, and I used to go to these meetings and sit up and listen. I never had very much to say, but I listened to Wayne Morse, and Hubert Humphrey, and Jackson and all of them, agonizing as to whether or not they should form a third party. Finally ended up deciding that they were going to stay in the Democratic party, which meant that, for me...I was never particularly interested in Americans for Democratic Action, because I felt I wanted the third party. I felt that the third party was really what was needed. And the schism carried over into the cooperative movement. And there were some who felt that we should have a third party, and some who felt that they should stay in the Democratic party, and that they should be careful of the Communist movement and not let the Communists take over, and all the cliches that abounded at that time.
So as a result, the office staff broke up and I was without a job. At that time, Mrs. Barker's* business was expanding so rapidly that she really needed help for...office help, really. So that was when I started at Cardozo Sisters. As a result of my training in that office in the co-op, I was able to grasp, to take over a lot of the minor business chores that Mrs. Barker did. And therefore, she could devote more of her time to advance planning. So I just sort of fitted in at that particular time. Actually, Cardozo Sisters started, had been in existence for fifteen years before I started there.
* Elizabeth Cardozo Barker, sister of Catherine Lewis.﻿5
CL: (cont.) Gradually I, as a result of the freedom of movement that Mrs. Barker gave me, and my own interest, I got to be manager, and finally general manager. So now, let's see...where were we?
MG: Well, we worked our way pretty well through your work career. Let
me go back and ask you a couple of specific questions. What was the name of your union when you were at the Census Bureau?
CL: Oh, dear.
MG: Don't remember?
CL: I haven't the faintest recollection. No, it had to be something connected with the government, although at that time...
MG: Was it American Federation of Government...what is that, Government Employees?
CL: It had to... No, I think it was, must have been a CIO [Congress of Industrial Organizations], because it was made up of quite liberal young people.
MG: I see.
CL: They were just as interested in the welfare of the Negroes as of the whites. But strangely enough, Negroes were—at least in the Census Bureau, and in the lower echelons—Negroes were strangely antiunion. But as a result, when they got to the point where they could see that the union was just as quick to go to the defense of a Negro as it was of a white, I think it gradually became rather strong. But it had to be a CIO union.
MG: Do you remember where on Fourteenth Street the Rochdale Co-op was,
where the headquarters were, what the cross street was? Not the number so much. I'm interested to know if the building is still there.
CL: I doubt it. I think it was Fourteenth—it was in the middle of the block. One of the streets was Clifton Street.
MG: Now, what was the total length of time that you spent working with Cardozo Sisters, the years?
CL: I started in 1949 and I retired in 1965. As a matter of fact, I
worked there longer than I had told my husband I was going to work. I told him, "I'm going to work fifteen years. After that I'm going to stop." But I did work longer than that.
MG: CL:
What was the area in Southeast where the Rochdale store was?
It was at Twenty-first and Alabama Avenue. I think it's still there but it's not a... I don't know what it is now. Because it was to a﻿6
CL: (cont.) certain extent a shopping center, one of the first shopping centers. They had a store, they had the grocery store; then there was a cleaning establishment; then there was a shoe repair place, and then there was a drugstore. That was all in that little complex right there, all in that one building. But they were all very small, and I think, if I'm not mistaken, I think the cleaning establishment gradually took over the rest. I don't know whether it took, it has the store or not, because it's been, oh, I guess about three years since we've been out there. I don't remember.
MG: Mrs. Lewis, have there been any other work interests or career interests that you might like to have pursued?
CL: Well, at the time, before I got married, I went to Hunter College in Brooklyn, New York. And unfortunately, I was not particularly interested in an academic career at that time, or even achieving a diploma, a degree. So I think I was there a year, and then my husband and I got married. He was still in college also. So I, instead of continuing at Hunter, I changed to Pratt Institute and took up dressmaking. And I was in school there for a year, and meanwhile, my husband graduated from college at Amherst, in Amherst, Massachusetts. And I worked in various dressmaking establishments in New York. Then when he graduated from college, we came down. We both decided that it was cheaper for us to come down and live together with his mother and his father. So I didn't do very much with my sewing career at that time. The only thing I knew was that I despised it. I didn't like it at all. Mainly because I was just really doing finishing work more than anything else. I never did work in a factory. I think I would have...I never would have worked in a factory. But I did work in some of the better dressmaking establishments in New York as a result of being at Pratt Institute...
MG: Do you remember what some of those were?
CL: No. But I know they were on—I don't know whether it was Seventh Avenue—that was where there was... You know, there were certain areas where if you worked, they knew you were working in a good establishment, and I think it was Seventh Avenue. But anyway, you can have low paying, minimum wage jobs anywhere, and that's where I was. So it really was no particular effort for me to leave that. I left it gladly, as a matter of fact. And as a matter of fact, my career was in a hiatus, if you want to call it a career. I've never had any particular desire to establish a career, because I just...it was never necessary at that particular time. I had a husband who, even if his salary was poor, it was still something that he could depend on every month. Because almost as soon as he came out of Amherst, the next year, he took his master's degree at Howard. And then the following year, he was employed as an instructor, which was in 1930. And a note aside, he celebrated his fiftieth anniversary at Howard last year. So as a matter of fact, there was no particular motivation for me. I was, as I said, I was never a declared feminist. It just seemed to me that, not to sound too reactionary, but a woman was a woman, and a man was a man, and there wasn't anything you could do about it.﻿7
MG: What did you see that involving?
CL: Nothing. I mean, I was not particularly upset about that because,
whereas my thinking was liberal, it never extended to the point where I felt that there were things that a woman could do just as well as a man. Although it was understood to me, as far as I was concerned, that if a woman wanted to, so she wanted to. But at that particular time, most women didn't want to be the things that they insist that they want to be now. They didn't feel as though their...well, I think, to a certain extent, a lot of this was what I now call social manipulators. They felt that in order to... They were willing to build their own empires and their own careers on suggesting to people that this is what is socially correct and something else is socially incorrect. And from time immemorial, most people have been open to suggestion.
MG: So do you see, saw this as a social force, a kind of conditioning women's responses?
CL: Yes, I would think so. Although I do—I mean, I know now from reading, that the women's movement started way back in the early 1900s. But I just felt... I mean, I just was not, I had no interest in it, I had no part in it, and no desire to take part in it. Because I still feel that it has caused, to a certain extent, a conflict. Part of it, I think, is a result of... Or the conditions now, the social conditions now, are a result of the conflict between this desire of women to fulfill themselves, as opposed to the need to raise a family, and to be partners. Because it was sort of an unspoken thing with my husband and me. There was no Question of anything else but a partnership. And I suppose because I had never experienced that conflict, I never tried, I never felt the need to resolve it.
MG: Do you feel that the primary role for women is to be mothers and wives?
CL: No, the primary role for women is to be what they want to be.
MG: But you feel that for yourself that was...
CL: For me, for me, that was what I wanted to be. And I still feel that if a woman is going to have children, that she needs to give a great deal of thought to turning over the rearing of her children to somebody else who is...that she really doesn't know anything about. When she goes out to work, she really doesn't [know] what's happening as far as her children are concerned. And that to a certain extent, because I felt that a woman should stay and raise her child—although I didn't have the patience that a lot of women have, and as a result of that, decided that one child was enough. And of course, back then, that really was going against the social mores of the time. Because at that time, the baby boom...
MG: And large families were encouraged.﻿8
CL: Yes. But as usual, what other people felt was of no particular
importance to me. And I felt that in order to be fair to myself, and fair to my husband and to my child, with the little patience that I had, it was better to have only one child. I feel that's a completely personal opinion, and it had nothing to do with what other people were saying and feeling. And while I don't condemn women for seeking their fulfillment, it's a clich£ as far as I'm concerned. I think that they should realize that there is a responsibility and that it results in unforeseen circumstances. I mean, nobody really could see thirty years from now that the young people of the middle class and upper-middle class, both white and colored, would have the disdain, really, for the social results of their actions. But they have. It's just simply that I feel that both a husband and a wife, they got to the point where the children were not important. I'm really going off the track.
MG: No, I wanted to ask you, when you were saying that you felt that
women who had children ought to take a good, hard look at what would be entailed in having those children cared for by others, if you had the same concern for men making that decision, determination, before they became fathers, or whether or not you think this is primarily a feminine responsibility?
CL: Well, of course, back there in that time, the fathers didn't have too much—unless they wanted to, they weren't required to. Nowadays, in order to be able to have any effect whatsoever on family life, as far as I can see, husband and wife are required to play a cooperative role.
MG: Is that something you, you are...
CL: I just, I feel that way.
MG: ...positive about?
CL: Yes, I'm positive. Now, I don't feel that the husband should say,
"Well, I've been out working eight hours a day, and whatever happens in the house doesn't concern me." Now, if the wife has been out working eight hours a day, and the husband works eight hours a day, it just seems to me that whatever is needed in the house should be shared.
MG: Why do you think you're not a feminist?
CL: Because I don't go, run around yelling it from the housetop that I believe in this. That is what I have felt long before other people have felt, I think.
MG: But you see feminism today as something that's active, connected with organizations and protest and the rest?
CL: Yes, and feminism as a result of the suggestion that this is what a feminist is.﻿9
MG: Rather than some internal feeling, personal feeling?
CL: Yes, that's why I think there is that conflict, whereas there never was that particular conflict. Although my husband did have some very decided ideas about what a woman's role should be and what a man's role should be, as a result of his mother's upbringing. Because his mother, oh, she felt too that a woman's role should be the raising of children. And yet, she was very active in the community. But it took a very minor part of her life. Her main life was being a housewife and a mother. But of course, you see, that was back then. She was married in the late nineteenth century, and of course, those were accepted ideas.
MG: So are you saying that woman's role, whatever it entails, should be freely chosen...
CL: Yes.
MG: ...and not the result of any kind of social manipulation?
CL: I would say yes, to a certain extent. Although as I said, I have
never, never... Let's say, I have been willing to accept the result of not going along with the crowd. But if you feel that you should be doing what other people are doing, that's something...you go along with whatever the social mores of the day are. Well, I have never felt that way. I have always felt that I would accept the result of that unwillingness to go along with the crowd.
MG: Mrs. Lewis, could you make some remarks, whatever you'd like to say about your family background?
CL: Well, I would say that my family background probably is responsible for a lot, to a great extent, for the way I feel. My father was, I suppose you would say he was a maverick. At that time, he was considered insubordinate. But nowadays, they're called mavericks. But he was an educator. And he had very definite ideas on just how children should be educated. And he was a very good teacher, but he didn't like to submit too much to authority, I think mainly because, to a certain extent, he resented the segregation in the schools, and he just felt that people in authority really didn't have authority. But anyway, finally, even though he was supposed to be an excellent teacher, he was principal. I think he was principal for years and years.
MG: This was here in Washington?
CL: Yes. And his [father's] father had a distinguished career. His career was even more distinguished, much more distinguished than his. He was secretary of state and secretary of the treasury in South Carolina during the Reconstruction. And he, of course, had his own ideas about the capabilities and possibilities of Negroes. He just felt﻿10
CL: (cont.) that they were capable of doing whatever a white person could do if they were given the proper education and the proper opportunities. And one of the things that my sister always remembered about my father was when he used to say that his father, whenever he encountered any free Negroes in the South, he would always say, "Hold up your head. Now you can hold up your head." Because at that time, a Negro was not supposed to, he was supposed to keep his head bowed and not supposed to look a white man in the face when he was talking with him. But that was his motto, "Hold up your head." And he did what he could, in addition to his political career, to establish education for the Negroes in South Carolina. He was the founder of the Avery Institute.
Well, coming from that background of necessity, recognizing the need for education, and always being exposed to... Whatever discussions there were, were always educative discussions. We felt that the place of the Negro, as my grandfather and his father felt, was what he could make of it himself. And we just didn't feel that because we were Negroes, we were simply burdened down as a result of the prejudice of the whites. And it did give you a certain feeling of freedom and detachment from this continual hatred that most Negroes felt. Because I do—I mean, I did feel back then, that whatever I could do, whatever I would do would be what I would, as you say, what I would decide. And it was not a result of prejudice or lack of prejudice. It was what I was able to do.
So this, to a certain extent, was in spite of the later education that we had. Because when my mother died, and then my grandmother died, my father was really hard put to decide what to do with six children. So he had to break up the family after his mother, who looked after us, after his mother died. At that time, he was teaching out in Deanwood, and it was... that was really out in the boondocks, and he found it almost impossible to get a reliable person to look after us. And although my sister, Elizabeth, was really regarded as the mother of the family, she was only nine. So he finally ended up breaking up the family, and sent the three oldest to Rock Castle, and sent my sister Frances and me to Holy Providence, which is a Catholic, to a certain extent, orphanage. And my brother was sent to Villanova. Actually, that was the only one place where he had any particular, had to pay anything. We stayed there, my sister and I, for a year and a half. At that time, I was seven years
old, in the___ I was six—was it seven?—years old, and I think I
was two grades above what I was supposed. And my sister was eight, and she was also two grades above. Well, the Catholic nuns thought that was outrageous because, after all, that particular school was supposed to train Negroes to be houseservants, and they felt that that was entirely too much. So they put me back two grades, and kept her in the same grade the whole time we were there. That was another shaper, shaping of my character because...
MG: Were you aware of this at the time, what was being done?﻿11
CL: Yes, vaguely. The curriculum was of no particular interest as far
as I was concerned. So I established the practice of simply playing through school, because I had had all of that before and I didn't have to go through that. And curiously enough, it had the exact opposite effect on my sister. She became even more studious. Mainly I think, mainly because at that time, everybody kept saying, "Catherine, why don't you be like Frances?" And which made me, maverick that I am, even more determined that I was going to be different. So when we came out of there, we were, I think a half a year behind our age, and we had to make that up.
MG: And you had originally gone in two years above your age? And that was with education received in Negro schools?
CL: Yes. And so we finally caught up, although to this day, I never did get algebra. No, not algebra—what is that?
MGt Geometry?
CL: No. Just before...not long division. Anyway, algebra. I think it
was algebra. But so we...at that time, I think we, for I guess about a year, we sort of moved around from pillar to post. My father got restless. We sort of moved. I think at that time, he was principal at Magruder, and we went to school there. And then when we got to the eighth grade, my mother's will was finally settled, and the money that she had inherited was divided among the six children. My sister Elizabeth bought a house on S Street and she took us all to live with her there.
But unfortunately, my father decided that we—my sister Frances and I —must go down to Spelman Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia, which set us back again educationally because we were the youngest children in the school and as a result, to a certain extent, of a true-and-false test, Frances got the highest score and I got the next highest score. And I think there must have been two or three hundred young women in the school. And one of them very indignantly could not understand why her score was so low, because the town where she came from, she taught high school, which as far as I was concerned, gave a very good description of the quality of education there. It was no better than at Providence, although it was, I think it was a Rockefeller founded school. And when we came from there, well, we were behind a half a year again, and we had to go to summer school in order to catch up. And then the following year, we went to Dunbar. And actually, those years were, I guess you could say, the happiest years of our lives because we really had a home life which was a happy home life.
MG: This was while you were at Dunbar?
CL: Yes, as a result of living with my sister. So we went through Dunbar without any particular thing happening except we were growing up and, as I say, being very happy. But unfortunately, my habit of playing was still with me. My sister went to Michigan, University of﻿12
CL: (cont.) Michigan, and I went to Hunter. And that's...I think, we have covered that period since then.
MG: Now, just a couple of questions here. Would you give your grandfather's name and your father's name, for the record?
CL: Francis Lewis Cardozo, and my father's name is also the same.
MG: And where was Holy Providence located?
CL: Philadelphia. I've forgotten the order. Mrs. Barker, I'm sure, has told you the order, the Catholic order.
MG: All right, is there anything you'd like to say about your personal circumstances since that time, since your marriage?
CL: Incidentally, I should point out, and I think that that was one of the things that determined my whole thinking. At Holy Providence, as I said, the main thing was, the orphans there were supposed to be taught how to be good houseservants. And then, of course, they were also taught to be good Catholics. And one of the discussions, as far as Catholic dogma was concerned, this nun who I don't think had too much education herself was talking about what would happen, what was a good Catholic and what was not a good Catholic, and what would happen if you were not a good Catholic. And so I piped up and said, "What would happen if a child"—they emphasized the fact that you had to be baptized immediately—and I said, "well, now what would happen if a baby is born and he dies before he is baptized?" "Oh," she says, "he would never see the face of God." And I just thought that that was wrong, and immediately everything Catholic just rolled off me like water off a duck's back. My sister said that she didn't notice it herself, but at that time, it just affected me. I just felt that anything or any institution that felt that was... And you'd be amazed at the number of institutions that do feel that, not only Catholics, but other institutions who feel, "If you don't think the way we think then..." So, as I said, I guess, I was about seven or eight years old them, so that has really affected my thinking all my life.
MG: Have you had any interest in any other established religion?
CL: No. Because, you see, Spelman was Baptist, and their dogma, as far as I was concerned, was just as static as the Catholic church. And as far as religion was concerned, it had no effect on me whatsoever. I was never born again, [laughter]
MG: Okay. Now, back to this earlier question. Is there anything else
you'd like to say about your personal circumstances, you know, since becoming adult?
CL: No. Let's see. Where were we...at the time when I started working for my sister, I became more and more interested in the progress of﻿13
(cont.) the organization. And I did what I could. I learned as much about the business end and also about some of the things that I felt were sort of a gap. For instance, when Negroes started coloring their hair, I tried to find out whatever I could about the best types of color, and I'm sure Mrs. Barker has told you about the fact that we continually had demonstrations. We tried to keep up with all the advances in hairdressing. And the fact that it was not done in other Negro shops didn't deter us one way or the other. We just thought that one of the things that we were doing actually was contributing to the self-respect of Negro women at that time. Not only of the operators who worked for us, but the fact that Negro women at that time felt that they should be well groomed. And one of their ways of being well groomed was to have their hair fixed as close as possible to the way the white people felt. Now things are completely different now. So many of them seem to think that it has to be exactly the opposite. Well, of course, that's another one of those things, personal, more or less, choice. And then something that, you go along with the mores of the t ime. But we just felt that we were contributing to the self-respect of the Negroes, Negro women, and that was the most important thing as far as we were concerned, aside from the shop, the progress of the shop. We felt that that was the most important thing, that Negro women should build their self-respect. So that was one of the things. It was something on the side that we did. And then, to a certain extent, it wasn't anything that was discussed as a policy, but it was just something that all of us felt was necessary.
I suppose I should get up into the sixties when my husband's mother became ill, had a stroke in 1957. And she had to be institutionalized after about—I think we tried to take care of her for about a year, and we found that we couldn't do it. So she had to be institutionalized. Then really, to a certain extent, was a crossroads in our lives because, as a result of the fact that my husband did not have the responsibility of his mother, he was able to accept a fellowship at Harvard. And, as a result of that, his educational qualifications were enhanced. I think he was an assistant professor at that time, but when he came back, he was promoted to associate professor. He had gotten his Ph.D. long before that, but he was promoted to associate professor and his prestige at the university, which was well deserved, continued up until his retirement in 1975. Because he really was interested in just about everything, every aspect of the university. This fellowship was in Chinese relations —I've forgotten what the name of it was. But it was the Social Science Research Foundation fellowship. At that time, they had no Chinese history at Howard, and he felt that there should be. So he took the course, and as a result of that, he became interested in Chinese history. And finally he was responsible for the hiring of a woman who had lived in China for many years, and he was able to turn over that part of the Chinese history to her. So he finally broadened out to all aspects of history, and I think it [the course] finally ended up, "Europe and the Wider World," although it wasn't called that at the time. Now I'm going ahead of myself.﻿14
CL: (cont.) At that time, the sixties had come, and of course, the
demonstrations against the Vietnam war, and he read as much about that as he could. Then the black power movement started, and he started reading about that, and as a result of that, he felt that those students who felt that race consciousness was something that just started in the sixties, that was wrong. Because it was something that started back with the beginning, with DuBois and all the rest of those. And as far as that's concerned, with my family. So he just felt that they should be told that that was wrong, that the fact that Negroes were conscious of their race, well, that was possible... I mean, that was something that happened when the first Negro stepped on this shore. They knew that they were, that they had to prove a lot of things not only to the white race but to themselves. So it took him into a study of Negroes who had achieved something. And as a result, he was given money to do research, and one of the things that he did research on was Negro seamen, Negro whalemen. I got interested in it, and so I worked with him.
MG: Then your experience with the census records stood you in good stead?
CL: Yes. Because you see, with the census records, it was a case of
patient search, and that's all the same way with this research. You had to go through pages and pages and pages of nothing. And finally, you would get some, really, nugget of interest. And that went on, I guess, until really, until I got to the point where I was really more interested in that than I was in hairdressing. And at that time, I just felt that the shop would get along without me, because I was simply not interested as I should have been. And because I was not as interested as I should have been, I felt that my contribution was not what it should be. And so I just felt that it was time for me to step out. So that's what I did, in 1965, much to Mrs. Barker's and Mrs. Holmes's distress, and the distress of everybody. But I just felt that, well, I just felt that that was something that I had to do. It was my own personal choice. Oh, I agonized over it for, I guess, beginning in about the middle of 1963. I just felt... But it was getting to the point where it was affecting my health. And my arthritis, which had been troubling me since I was twenty-five, was beginning to get worse. And the doctor said it was a result of tension. So he felt that one of the things to reduce the tension was to make this decision one way or the other. So that was what I did in 1965. Didn't help my arthritis any, but... So, and I think for about a year after that I worked part time. But then after that, I stopped altogether, and then devoted a lot of my time to helping my husband collate the material that he had gotten. So that's where I am now.
MG: Would you say your husband's name for the record?
CL: Harold 0. Lewis.﻿15
MG: When you were discussing Dr. Lewis's career in the sixties and your own involvement along the way, we touched on some racial matters. I wanted to ask you a couple of other things concerning race. I noticed that you use the term Negro. Do you prefer it to black, or to Afro-American, or to colored?
CL: Well, yes, because... Now I use the word black almost interchangeably. There was a time when we used to use Negro and colored almost interchangeably. But now we use the term black and Negro almost interchangeably. But at that time, when the term black was insisted upon, I just thought it was just another one of those affectations of young people. Because I mean, after all, Negro is Spanish for black, and so... And for years actually, there was the struggle to get the word Negro in capital letters. For years, they refused to put the word in capital letters. And finally, we finally achieved that and then here we are, we have to go back to black again. I just felt it was just, just something that...as they say nowadays, one of those ego trips of the black power movement that evidently stuck. And there are some who wanted to use that as their symbol of defiance— I guess I shouldn't say defiance—of difference. At that time, everything was being different from the whites. And that was their way of being different, as well as the hairdo at that time, which was called the Afro. Of course, it really to a certain extent, it worked to the detriment of the shop, because Negroes didn't have to have their hair fixed as much as they did. I think, if I'm not mistaken, that's probably one of the reason why Negro beauty shops went down so quickly at that particular time.
MG: Did they?
CL: I think they did. Ours didn't suffer as much as some of the others. But you see, it simply was not necessary for Negroes to go to have their hair fixed. Because so many of our customers had what we chose to call permanent appointments, and they came a certain time, a certain day every other week or every three weeks, and they were our preferred customers. Well, it simply wasn't necessary. Of course, a lot of those preferred customers continued, but you can't exist on old customers. If you're in a service organization, you have to have, you have to continue to have new customers. And at that time, new customers, the growth was very, very slow. And so I mean I think that contributed to...
MG: This is a little off the track, but I'm just curious to know whether or not you feel that the natural or the Afro hairstyle is something that is becoming increasingly less popular. Is that your perception, or not?
CL: Yes. Actually, as you can see, I have what one would call a natural, myself. But that was really something that was forced on me. When I had shingles, I couldn't stand anybody to touch my hair. I couldn't even get my hair shampooed. And so I just went and had... As a matter of fact, I cut it off. My husband and I cut it off﻿16
CL: (cont.) myself. And I think it must have been about three months before I could even have my hair shampooed. I shampooed it myself in order to keep from infecting the... But it was about three months before I had my hair shampooed. And then I think, I had been going back to the shop...I still was keeping my hair cut short because, oh even before then, I was taking swimming, and it's very difficult to keep your hair any way to take swimming. And then I got the shingles Then in January, I had been going back, I guess, about a month and a ' half when I had this terrible attack of rheumatoid arthritis. I couldn t raise my arm, I couldn't do any...I couldn't stand to hold my head back. And so my husband had to sort of shampoo my hair the best way he could. So I've gotten to the point where it's less trouble. And also, taking five different medicines, I just felt that it was a waste of time to go too often. So I shampoo my hair quite frequently myself.
But at that time, back there in the times when the Afro was first started, I would never have assumed that hairdress because I just felt that it was an affectation. Particularly in view of my color. I just felt that it was just something... it was a way out of the way as far as I was concerned. In addition to the fact that I formerly worked in a beauty shop. I just felt that it was just something that it was not necessary for me to do. Anybody else could do it who wanted to, but it was just simply not necessary for me to do
MG:
MG:
You didn't think it was linked in any way with you personally, with racial consciousness at all?
CL: No. It was linked with others. They assumed that as a symbol of racial consciousness and racial division. At that time, it was a case of almost complete cleavage. Yet, we went through a terrible time at that time, I think, because we were so divided, so schizophrenic.
You mean, divided as a race or as a nation, or what?
CL: Divided as to what our thinking was, most of the black power people Because they wanted everything, we wanted everything, but we didn't want to have to work for it. I think that an awful lot of people who were active at that time have finally come to the point where they had to agree that that was the problem. We wanted everything, and we wanted to blame the white people for what we were. Well, to a certain extent, we were responsible ourselves, and we didn't want to accept the responsibility. Now we are beginning to see that it is necessary for us to do a lot of the things that we just refused to do at that time. We refused, we just felt that being black was, oh, just wonderful. You didn't have to do anything else, you didn't have to exert yourself. You didn't have to exert any self-discipline. You were simply black, and that was it, that was the important thing. Whereas we soon found out that it wasn't—economically, or socially, or anything else. And when it came to our own self-respect. Because﻿17
CL: (cont.) we found that the things that were handed to us on a silver platter, we couldn't handle. We simply could not handle it. And it ended up that what we had to...our self-respect was almost destroyed, and now we have to turn around and build it up almost from nothing.
MG: What were you referring to when you mentioned things handed on a silver platter?
CL: Civil rights. There were a lot of things that we fought for, yes.
A lot of the things that were fought for, and some of the people gave their lives for, but there were certain advantages that... At that time, affirmative action, that term was not used, but that's what it was, you see, affirmative action. My son has had experience with that, because he is now in the lower echelon of administrators at Lockheed. And he has done what he could to give engineers—graduate engineers, Negro engineers—whatever positions and chances that he could. Some of them turned out fine. Some of them were able to handle the fact that they were given responsibilities that Negroes had never been given before. But others couldn't do it, because they just—I mean, I don't know, they just felt that they shouldn't have to put out the effort. They shouldn't have to put out that effort to... And it's necessary in whatever field of endeavor you're in, you have to work hard at it.
MG: Do you feel those were racial failings or simply personal failings on the part of those individuals?
CL: To a certain extent, racial failings. It finally ended up where it was a generational failure. Negroes and those whites that... The whites revolted against the whole middle-class ethic, and they, of course, were the flower children. And the Negroes were rejected. As I said, they were really confused. They really did not know what they wanted. They didn't know how to go about it. I don't know whether that is... I'm not indicting anybody.
MG: No, I want to hear what you have to say.
CL: But it's just, they simply did not know how to go about accomplishing what it was they wanted, mainly because they didn't know.
MG: Do you think, do you still perceive that there are definite generational—this is among Negroes—definite generational differences in racial attitudes?
CL: I would think so. Because back there in the sixties, the children of the sixties now, of the activists, they have gotten so where they realize that they have to get the education that their parents rejected. Their parents rejected it. They wanted to enter the mainstream, the economic mainstream, but they didn't want to acquire the education that was needed. But I think their children have either gotten to the﻿18
CL: (cont.) point where they figure, well, I don't have a chance anyway and there's no point in my trying. Or else they realize that it is necessary for them to get the education and to acquire not only the education but the experience. And let's face it, there are a lot of things that have been opened up to them. But those who have had the motivation, and the experience, and the education, like my son— I'm not citing him just to cite him, but his was a good example. He decided that if that was what the white man wanted, then he was going to give it to them. He was going to try to do whatever he could, and to be as good as they were. He didn't have that attitude that he had to be ten times better. That's, as far as I'm concerned, just as destructive as not trying at all, if you've got to be ten times better. Because that makes you a perfectionist and if you're a perfectionist, you're bad off no matter who you are. But he felt, I mean, he was going to give them of his best. And that's the way I think some of them feel, some of them feel.
MG: What's your son's name?
CL: Harold Lewis, Jr.
MG: Do you feel that getting an education and working hard are the only prerequisites necessary for entering the economic mainstream? In other words, if you accomplished those things, that you will, if you are black, pass over into the economic mainstream?
CL: That's an old-fashioned idea, I would think. But of course, back
then, you were still supposed to remain in your own place. You were supposed to work hard. And if you worked hard, you could advance to a certain place. But you weren't expected to get into the policymaking division. Now, that is what I would think most of the Negroes are trying to achieve now. That, if they get the education and the experience, what they are trying to achieve now is to get into the policy-making aspect, not only of government, but in the private sector. That is what has embittered a lot of them. Quite possibly the children of the activists, the 1960 activists, found that with all the education and all the experience and all the doors that were, so-called, supposed to be open to them, they did not get, they were not able to rise to policy making. And that's where the resentment is now.
MG: What do you see as the cause of that failure?
CL: Racial prejudice. Really, that's what it is. It's racial prejudice. Because whereas, as far as I'm concerned, the thinking of the Negroes was wrong in the 1960s, the thinking of the whites was wrong, too. Because they were troubled with this feeling of guilt, which the Negroes encouraged, that they were responsible for four hundred years of travail and that they should make it up to them. And I'm sure that you have read enough about the fact that a lot of whites did try to assuage their guilt by doing more for Negroes than they should have done. And the Negroes got to the point where they accepted more. Then, of course, you see, it's always a case of "What have you done for me lately?" And then, as always, the pendulum swings back the﻿19
CL: (cont.) other way. Because a lot of things, a lot of the advantages, a lot of the doors that were opened at that time, might have been opened too quickly, might have been opened before there were enough Negroes who were trained to do the things that needed to be done. And some of them succeeded and some of them didn't. Too many of them didn't. And the ones that didn't, were the ones that got the attention, as always. As always, you know, it's always the failures that get the attention. And so the whites seized on that as a reason for saying, "Well, the Negroes can do certain types, but they are not ready to be in the policy-making decision."
MG: What would you say has been the impact of race on your life?
CL: Not too much. That's the reason why I should be a little reluctant
to criticize those who have had distressful reaction in their attempt to change things. Because economically, I have not suffered. And I have never had any particular desire to do a lot of the things that the white people want us...want to do. And yet, I don't feel that I'm different from them. I have never felt—neither my husband nor I —have felt that we are different with a capital D. That we did what we did because we were human beings. And the white people who were friends of ours, were friends of ours because they felt the same way we felt. Now which, of course, meant that to a certain extent, our acquaintanceship was a little limited.
MG: Would you say that race has just been a neutral factor?
CL: As far as I was concerned. It might have had more effect on my husband because he could, he was really in the midst of it back there in the sixties. But he fought for what he felt was objectivity. He was where he was subjected to a lot of the indignities that anybody who tried to move against the mainstream. Because he felt that black power was a...I don't know, he didn't have the same feeling about black power that some of the others had a feeling about. But he always, he always said that the main thing that Negroes had to do was to become educated. And he always said that one of his reasons was Stokely Carmichael. At the time, Stokely was a member of SNCC, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and he was down South. He went down South and took part in a lot of the struggle in the South. He had always had respect for my husband because my husband did feel that education and discipline was important. And he was an excellent teacher. So a lot of his former students would look him up. So one time Stokely came up here and he spent almost the whole afternoon, and they were talking about the different aspects of the civil rights movement. And he said that he noticed that the Negroes from Howard were the only Negroes who were prepared to do the type of work that was needed, the legwork and the planning. Otherwise the whites did it.
MG: This is Carmichael who said this?
CL: Yes, this was Carmichael. This was before he...the black power...
And he said that he could see that it was very necessary for Negroes﻿20
CL: (cont.) to get experience in planning, in organization. That was
our lack. We did not know how to plan, we did not know how to organize. And the whites who went down with them, they were in greater danger really, than the blacks were, down there in the civil rights movement. The whole civil rights movement, back in that time, might have failed if it had not been for the organizing ability of the whites. But that embittered him. And he finally, I suppose, in order to maintain some kind of self-respect or something, he was the one who established this, started this black power movement. And I think he tried to convince them that in order to have power, in order to get somewhere, you had to have power. But apparently, neither he nor the others seemed to realize that the only way to have power was to have the education...to have the organizing ability to do the legwork that is necessary in any type of organization. So that, of course, was the beginning of the cleavage between the Negroes and the whites. They felt that they had to, some of them felt that they had to draw back and get that strength.
MG: Within the sixties' civil rights movement?
CL: Yes. They felt that they had to, the only way that they could get the experience, was to establish their own organization. 'Course, it was beside the point that the NAACP and the Urban League had long been established, and they had quite a bit of experience in organization and management. But you see, they were almost as anathema to the young Negroes in the sixties as the whites were. But I think that was one of the most, one of the positive results of the difference. But it has not been allowed, I think, to be carried to its final result. And when Negroes finally admit that it is necessary for them to be as educated as whites, then I think doors will continue to be open. But so far they're not open wide.
MG: Mrs. Lewis, that's the end of the prepared topics that we had agreed to cover. Is there anything else that you would like to add to the record?
CL: No. It's just, I hope that I haven't talked too much and gone too far afield.
MG: No. I'm sure you haven't done that. Thank you very much.
CL: I enjoyed it.﻿CATHERINE LEWIS
