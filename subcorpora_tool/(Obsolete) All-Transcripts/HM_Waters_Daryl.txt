Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always have to ask that are sort of a warm up.  They only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is sushi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is Caribbean blue.
Speaker 1: All right.  Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year is fall.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Favorite vacation destination would be Rio [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil].
Speaker 1: And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I do not have one.  Occasionally I use one from one of my bosses which is, "It ain't deep."
Story_ID: 672875
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history, your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Bernardine Helen Taylor [Bernardine Murden Taylor], B-E-R-N-A-R-D-I-N-E, Helen, H-E-L-E-N, Taylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R.  Her birth name was Murden, M-U-R-D-E-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born January 29th, 1937 in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family in terms of how far can you trace them back and what are the stories from that side?
Speaker 2: We can trace it back, I remember my Grandma Ben [Maud Murden], which who was actually my great, my great-grandmother.  And she was married to a guy named Ben [Ben Murden], and that goes back to 1886 is when he was born.  I, I don't remember him at all, and we, because we lived in Cleveland [Ohio] and most of our people lived in Detroit [Michigan] and Kankakee, Illinois, and down in Chattanooga, Tennessee, we didn't really connect a lot with them.  So it wasn't until we started doing family reunions that I even got to know anything about the family.  But overall it was just, you know, your typical working class families, that, you know, we actually all liked each other (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so--okay so your mother was born in Chattanooga so I guess, was it your mother's generation that moved to--north?
Speaker 2: No, she was born in Chattanooga, but I believe that my grandparents [Mary Murden and Raymond Murden] moved to Cleveland pretty early, so she actually went to school in Cleveland, but I don't think they spent that much time in Chattanooga.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandparents were the first generation to move north, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right. Okay, now any stories about your ancestors in Tennessee, what they were doing and what they--?
Speaker 2: We, you know, it's really strange.  It's like I keep trying to ask my people about, you know, stories about, about their relatives, but my family is pretty quiet about all of that stuff.  I'm not sure why.  All I know is that they, my grandfather had like, he had like, I think seven brothers and sisters so we kind of knew them because they lived in Detroit, but not really any, any, you know, interesting stories or outside of the fact that, you know, they did what they had to do to raise their families.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we interviewed the, we were in Chattanooga once, we interviewed The Impressions, two of The Impressions, Gooden [HistoryMaker Samuel Gooden] and I can't think of the other brother's name [HistoryMaker Fred Cash], but any, any musicians in the family in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Not in Tennessee, one of the people that moved from Tennessee to Detroit, I had an uncle apparently that played, you know, a hell of a piano.  I think his name was Ted [ph.], but I never, I never knew him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  What did your, did your mother grow up on the east side of Cleveland?
Speaker 2: She did grow up on the east side of Cleveland, and she went to East High School [Cleveland, Ohio] which at the time was, I think East High was starting to get integrated at that point because I know she had quite a few white friends as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did she have any stories about growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: I don't know why, my people don't talk about the past, they don't, I'm sorry about that.
Speaker 1: You know what her aspirations were growing up or what did she want to be?
Speaker 2: Growing up she wanted to be a model, she's actually, my mother is a beautiful woman, and she actually wanted to be a singer, but, of course, by the time she and my father [James Smith] got together, basically it was just time to make sure you settled down and do what you had to do to make sure your family was well taken care of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did she have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: She went to college later in life.  She, after she had all six of us, she went back to school, Case Western Reserve [Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] and got the degree in psychology.
Story_ID: 672876
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My birth father was James Smith, J-A-M-E-S, Smith, S-M-I-T-H.  I'm not sure of his date of birth, but he was born I believe in 1937 also, and he was born in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What can you tell us about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: His side of the family, again, just, you know, good honest working people.  I knew my, his, I knew his parents, my grandparents [Essie Smith and Jonathan Smith], very well, because they didn't live that far from us, and they came up from Georgia, so again, it's like just good salt of the earth people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now I also had, I think about the time I was two or three years old, my mother [Bernardine Murden Taylor] remarried and the father that I actually-- that actually raised me, is Jack Waters.  His name is J-A-C-K, W-A-T-E-R-S, and he was born in Toledo [Ohio] in 1926.  His, again, he didn't really know that much about his people, but he did, he came from West Virginia, and I know that he was, again looking for a better life.  At that time everybody was moving to Cleveland because there were certainly more jobs than in West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did your birth father have a, was able to graduate from high school and go to college, or--?
Speaker 2: My birth father, I don't think he went to college.  He did graduate from high school and he eventually got a job at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  Later in life he purchased a business called Dearing's [Cleveland, Ohio] which was a restaurant, bar and he became a pretty successful businessman for quite a while.
Speaker 1: Did you have much contact with him growing up?
Speaker 2: Not growing up, but I did start having more contact with him once I left, actually once I was in college because I could, whenever I came home I could stop by and I, I knew he would be somewhere around the restaurant.  And a lot of times I'd see him on holidays at my grandmother's house.  So even though he wasn't really a big part of my life, it's, you know, we certainly talk to each other quite a bit.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now is there a story about how he and your mother met?
Speaker 2: I think it was just high school sweethearts at East High School [Cleveland, Ohio] and, you know, they were a very attractive couple and they just managed to get together from there and decided, you know, they liked each other and they had me and my brother [Michael Waters], and after that, that's when, for whatever reason, they decided it was time to move on.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And how did you mother meet your stepfather?
Speaker 2: Why are you asking me all these questions?  I don't--(laughter) I'm not sure how he, how they met, but I do know that, they, like I said he was the guy that, that raised me basically.  I knew him from probably about the time I was three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well this is oral history, that's why we're going--
Speaker 2: I'm just kidding (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay (laughter), all right.
Story_ID: 672877
Speaker 1: Well when you consider, I guess, you know you got like three, maybe, and, and more factors too with your grandparents, but considering, you know, what you're like today and what your talents are, and your at- and your disposition is, who do you think you take the most after?
Speaker 2: I think that I probably take the most after my grandmother on my mother's side [Mary Murden] because she's, she was always the most practical, grounded of all the people, and I'm in a business that's crazy, and I, I find myself going to that kind of groundedness, that kind of inner strength just to keep me from losing my mind.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll have to ask you more about that later.  I guess we'll find out how crazy (laughter).
Story_ID: 672878
Speaker 1: Now you have siblings right?
Speaker 2: I have five brothers and sisters that I grew up with, and my real father [James Smith] actually had other relationships so there are other brothers and sisters that, some of who I met later in life, some of, I'm still not sure, we're trying to connect.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So can you name the ones you know about and where you fit in the order?
Speaker 2: Well the ones I grew up with I was the oldest and next to me is my brother Michael [Michael Waters].  Then there was Shelley [Shelley Waters], Suzanne [Suzanne Waters Wilkins], Bonnie Carol [Bonnie Waters-Burch] and Maryellen [Maryellen Waters].
Story_ID: 672879
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: The very earliest childhood memory I have is being at the hospital and I was probably maybe two years old and I found out later that that was because I was having a hernia operation, but probably the most vivid childhood memory that resonates is when we were very young, my mother [Bernardine Murden Taylor] used to make me open faced peanut butter sandwiches and I remember being on the front porch and a kid bumped into me and the open faced sandwich actually ended up in the dirt.  I was very upset and I just knew I couldn't go back and ask for another one.  And I think the reason that resonates so much is because later in life I realized that what I thought was a treat, 'cause I loved open faced peanut butter sandwiches was actually a result of us being poor, and, you know, that was, that was one way to save on, you know, on, on only having to use one slice of bread certainly saved the cost of a sandwich, you know, cut it down a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So now this is, is this before your mother met Mr. Waters [Waters' stepfather, Jack Waters]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  This is when she was still with my father [James Smith].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, what, what, now you grew up in East Cleveland, right?
Speaker 2: I did, I grew up in East Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 1: And was there a name for your particular neighborhood?
Speaker 2: East Cleveland was actually the name of the suburb.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but it was too small to actually have different kinds of neighborhoods outside of, of the fact that there were six elementary schools, so you were generally associated with the elementary school that you went to.  But, East Cleveland itself was in transition at that point.  When we moved in it was mostly white.  By the time I graduated, it was majority black, so, you know, I watched major changes happening throughout the course of my school, of my time at school there.
Story_ID: 672880
Speaker 1: Can you describe your neighborhood and, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Again, it was--we were so boringly middle class it was, you know, the neighborhood elementary school had like a merry-go-round in front and, you know, slides and all that.  There was a park that we all used to play at.  The thing that, that  impresses a lot of people about Cleveland [Ohio], particularly if you're from someplace like New York [New York], is how many people actually had houses, and, you know, they were standard middle class houses, but you know, you were very, very proud to actually own your own property.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were these mostly bricks or frame houses?
Speaker 2: Frame houses, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And actually, it's a source of major disappointment to me now because when I go back home, you know, you just see the destruction from the fact that people have not been able afford to keep those houses up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So economy was, has like fizzled sort of.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it has.  The economy, part of it was the economy, part of it was just people coming into the neighborhood that didn't have the kinds of incomes as we had when we're coming into it.  It's like, Jack [Jack Waters], my stepfather that legally adopted--legally adopted me that I grew up with,  he, I mean he was a postal, post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] worker, and there were a lot of jobs like that, a lot of teachers, you know.  A lot of those jobs just either don't, aren't around anymore or they're just not going to people that, there aren't people that are qualified to do them unfortunately.
Story_ID: 672881
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started school in, well, I started in East Cleveland [Ohio] so there was a small red, red brick school called Rozelle Elementary School [East Cleveland, Ohio] and I remember my first day of, of first grade actually because it was, they had just built a brand new audi--addition to the school so I mean the school just smelled completely brand new.  I was just very excited to be there.
Story_ID: 672882
Speaker 1: Did you show evidence of interest in music as an--at an early age?
Speaker 2: When I was about seven years old, we belonged to this Presbyterian church and the woman [Lydia (ph.)] that was the secretary there was leaving to go to Canada.  She was moving to Canada and she gave my mother [Bernardine Murden Taylor] her old upright piano and I started playing around on it and my mother asked if I wanted to take lessons and to me it was just something else to do so I said sure.  And it turned that I actually had some talent.  It's--the teacher that I originally started with told my mother that she needs to find somebody really good for me because, you know, I had, you know, such a lot of talent and she didn't feel that she could actually like provide me with what I needed.  So the answer to your question is I guess I did have talent.  I had no idea really myself, it was just like I said, something else to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, I take it, I mean were you exposed to any live music, you know I guess it may have been, in those days I know teachers knew how to play the piano in school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but, was that--what other live music were you exposed to?
Speaker 2: I wasn't really exposed to that much.  We were, you know, we didn't have a lot of money, so the only thing I was exposed to was a couple of records that my parents would have, but it was, it was more like when my, when my mother moved me to this place called The Cleveland Music School Settlement [The Music Settlement, Cleveland, Ohio], I started taking lessons playing piano, playing violin, taking music literature and we would have recitals all the time so I got to hear other people that were doing what I was doing and it wasn't until later, somewhere, I think seventh grade, is that, is the time when I made the switch actually from classical to listening to a lot of other kinds of styles of music because I had, I had a seventh grade music appreciation teacher who the first day of class, she was blasting Tammi Terrell and Marvin Gaye doing 'You're All I Need to Get By.'  And I'm like, "Wow." All of a sudden the stuff I was kind of forbidden to listen to at home is like being legitimized in school so, you know, it just gave me another chance to explore something else.
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute now, you are forbidden to listen to--
Speaker 2: My mother--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --pop music at home?
Speaker 2: There was a radio station in Cleveland [Ohio] called WJMO [WJMO Radio, Cleveland, Ohio].  They would blast all the latest sounds from R and B and James Brown was one of those.  I remember listening one day and my mother saying, "Turn that off," so I mean, it's not like it was, it was her way, of course, of trying to elevate me to a, to what she figured was a different, you know, a different plane that would benefit me more.  As it turns out ironically, it's, you know, it's listening to all those R and B sounds combined with the classical stuff that she had me exposed to that has given me the kind of, you know, the kind of layers that I have now to do what I do.
Speaker 1: Okay, I read in here that you were inspired by the Percy Faith orchestra [Percy Faith and his Orchestra] on the radio.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My grandmother always played, you know, middle of the road music, so it would be, you know, Frank Sinatra singing 'Strangers in the Night,' Percy Faith orchestra, a, a, you know, a little 'Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree.'  All that kind of stuff is what I listened to at home, and then, of course, I would go to high school [Shaw High School, East Cleveland, Ohio] and I'm listening to The Temptations and Supremes [The Supremes] and all those other people, so, you know, it made for, for a nice mix in terms of what I do now.
Speaker 1: Now did you get a transistor radio in those days?  I know you got an earphone with those.
Speaker 2: The transistor radio was actually what I was trying to listen to James Brown on, and that, that was when I was forbidden to listen to those kinds of stations (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. How did she tell, was it your movement (laughter)?
Speaker 2: It was more like I was playing it too loud so (laughter), but I, you know, I mean it's, again, by the time I got to high school, particularly, she realized that, you know, this was, this was a part of my DNA at this point as well, and by that point also I was involved with the, the jazz group in the high school as well as I was starting to play for Karamu [Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio] and I was starting to play for different kinds of theater groups as well.
Story_ID: 672883
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell us (background noise), I'm a back up a little bit and ask you, ask you to like tell us something about The Cleveland Music School Settlement--Settlement [The Music Settlement, Cleveland, Ohio].  What, what is that?
Speaker 2: The Cleveland Music School Settlement was this nonprofit organization that basically provided all kinds of, of music education to, to people that had any kind of talent and the best thing about it was that it was geared towards your income, towards your family income, so, you know, I got all kinds of blessings.  I would basically spend my Saturday there and it would cost my mother [Bernardine Murden Taylor] something stupid like eight dollars, you know, for a person per week.  And like I said, I was taking violin lessons, piano lessons, music appreciation and music lit [music literature] and music theory, so it was, that was the real foundation for who I am today.  I mean it's, college was a, a different thing, but without that foundation, I certainly would not be where I am today.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this education starts when you're eight years old?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is, you know, it's a time when they, they tell you that it's when music education really should start with kids.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so training meets talent--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --at an early age, thanks to the Cleveland Music School Settlement.
Speaker 2: Right, and the thing, the other thing that was great about them was that because we were kids they knew how to make it fun so that, you know, it wasn't like a, you know, a class class, it was--we played games, we had contests to see who could do things the quickest and it was just, so it was never work to me, except of course when I got home and had to practice for a half an hour to two hours a day, but in, in the actual classroom itself, it was just a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 672884
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Bernardine Murden Taylor] allow to listen to some of the popular, but not necessarily R and B piano players like Eddie Heywood or Roy Meriwether or Earl Grant or somebody like that--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: We didn't--we didn't really listen to jazz in my house.  But I did listen to a lot of Ferrante [Arthur Ferrante] and, I keep pronouncing this wrong--
Speaker 1: Teicher [Louis Teicher]?
Speaker 2: Teich- yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I mean they're bad cats.  They can play, but, you know, it was very little jazz in our house.  I remember we got one Count Basie Orchestra album and we played that quite a bit, but because it wasn't part of what I normally did, I almost didn't even appreciate it.  It's, you know, as opposed to, you know, listening to subliminally, absorbing the sounds of Ferrante and absorbing the sounds of the Percy Faith orchestra [Percy Faith and his Orchestra].  Those kind of people, you know, it, it was, I don't know, it just became a, a really interesting part of my DNA.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you, in terms of Broadway music, did you, what did you hear, I mean can you remember when you first heard some Broadway, type music?
Speaker 2: Well, when I first heard Broadway, I actually played Broadway, a Broadway show before, well not on Broadway, but I played it on musical theater, a show called 'Guys and Dolls' in ninth grade and that was my real introduction to musical theater and I actually, I, I just loved it, in terms of the whole, the different components, the whole, the dance with the acting with the music.  It was just fascinating to me in a, in a way that classical music just was not.  It's, it's, it was the various layers I think that really fascinated me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you have a favorite classical composer at all?
Speaker 2: I did.  My favorite classical composer would have been Debussy [Claude Debussy], not that I could do him any justice at that age, but absolutely, I just always loved the whole romantic side of music, so between him, and actually I mean I, I loved the challenge of somebody like Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach], but again, it's like at that, at that young age, it's really difficult to play that kind of music.
Story_ID: 672885
Speaker 1: So 'Guys and Dolls' kind of strikes a nerve, and so this is, you're in the eighth grade what in 1970, or--
Speaker 2: Let's see, thirteen, that puts me around '69 [1969], '70 [1970], yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  All right.  You're at like Kirk Junior High School [W.H. Kirk Junior High School; W.H. Kirk Middle School, East Cleveland, Ohio], right?
Speaker 2: Yep, Kirk Junior High.
Speaker 1: All right.  So in 1970 you start at Shaw High School in East Cleveland [Ohio],--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and that's when, did, were you at Karamu House [Cleveland, Ohio] by then?
Speaker 2: I started Karamu House probably, I think my sophomore or junior year while I was at Shaw.  There was, we had done a production the summer before, of a show called 'The Me Nobody Knows' [Gary William Friedman and Will Holt] in East Cleveland.  I was actually being paid to, to do musical theater by that point during the summer.  That was my summer job.  And the show actually transferred to, to Karamu and I did that show there, the following year I did a show called 'Inner City,' and, you know, it was just, it was great working with older people who, you know, I, you just, you keep learning, you just absolutely keep learning from people.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So was there a, now throughout this, and the reason why we, we ask all these questions and we try to identify people that actually have helped in history, so was there, were there mentors, you know, in grade school or at the, in the schools that--Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I can't really say there were, there were mentors, but my piano teacher, she, she really pressed me to really keep at it.  As a matter of fact she, at one point when I was taking violin at the same time, she just, she told me, "You know Daryl [HistoryMaker Daryl Waters] you don't wanna be a jack of all trades, master of none.  You need to concentrate on the piano because you are really, really good at it," and ironically, it's the jack of all trades that has become my talent in terms of being able to do a little bit of everything well enough that people want to hire me to, you know, to, to do a, a overall musical theater department.
Story_ID: 672886
Speaker 1: I was asking about mentors, I guess, in school; you said your piano teacher was important, very important.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  She, she just kept pressing me and, and encouraging me.  You know especially if you're talking about classical piano.  It's really, really, really difficult.  It just takes a while to get things in your fingers, and, you know she, in her own way she would just find ways to encourage me and, and, for that part, so did my mother [Bernardine Murden Taylor].  It's, you know, I remember sitting at the piano once before a competition, because we had to do all these competitions when I was a kid, and spending like an hour on maybe, you know, two seconds worth of music trying to get the fingering right and trying to make this passage smooth, and I remember finally getting it right and just saying, "Yes," to myself, and hearing my mother in the other room just saying, "Yeah, that's it, that's the way to go."  So it's, you know, it's, even though it's like small things like that, those are the things, of course, that keep you going.  And you don't even, you don't realize it until later in life that, you know, it's not, sometimes, sometimes it's not somebody, you know, pushing you so much as somebody just nudging you.
Story_ID: 672887
Speaker 1: What qualities did you have as a young piano player that made you like, made you special, that--where your teacher thought you had really a future?
Speaker 2: Looking back at it now, I think that I can say that I understood the relation between, between playing and feeling and, and dynamics, you know, the loud, the soft, the--every note has to mean something, and but when I was a kid I didn't see that.  All I saw was a lot of other people.  Like I said we did, we had to do competitions against each other so I, I saw a lot of really good piano players that could, you know, run off a scale at like twenty thousand miles per minute, per second and I could not, I couldn't do it as fast as they could.  But what I could do was give the stuff that I performed apparently a lot more feeling than what they did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So I could see why you would like something like Debussy [Claude Debussy], you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 672888
Speaker 1: Now did you have a--who was the person I guess, was there a person that kind of shepherded you into Karamu House [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Like I said, it's because I was the music director on the show the summer before, I was the natural choice.  It was, having said that, you know it was unusual to have a high school student be the conductor for a show at Karamu House.  It's, you know, it's always adults.
Speaker 1: So you came in the door doing it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, yeah.  And I knew most of the cast so because they, they transferred a lot of the cast as well so it was just like, it--
Speaker 1: So this was a production that was in high school [Shaw High School, East Cleveland, Ohio] that, that--
Speaker 2: Every summer--
Speaker 1: Summer production.
Speaker 2: --in summer productions the, there was a program called CETA that actually, for whatever reason, they decided they were gonna give money to, to this group of students that were gonna do a musical theater production every summer.  I mean it was a great way to, you know, instead of going around picking up paper in the park, here we were putting on a play every summer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973]--
Speaker 2: Exactly, yes.
Speaker 1: --during the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] administration.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: And, right, right, and I know usually they had the Neighborhood Youth Corps--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --they would pay you, they would supply you with rakes and brooms and stuff--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly, right.
Speaker 1: --and that's what kids would do in the summer.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And we were having fun doing what we were doing in theater.  It was really great.  So we did that production one summer, then I moved to Karamu.  The next summer we did 'Inner City' and that moved to Karamu as well, and the next summer I, we did, I forget what it was.  I think it was 'Roar of the Grease Paint' ['The Roar of the Greasepaint - The Smell of the Crowd,' Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley], but it was, that was how I earned my money in the summer instead of whatever else, so every, it's, it's, it's, I feel fortunate that pretty much everything that I've done my whole life has gotten me to this point.

Speaker 1: Now as you were in high school [Shaw High School, East Cleveland, Ohio] and got exposed to more popular music, who were some of your favorite, you know, I guess bands or acts, you know in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, Earth, Wind and Fire later, but coming up [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones was my idol.  I mean he was just a bad cat, just, you know, between doing records and movies, TV, he was just the man who I wanted to be.  So I listened to a lot of him, especially in terms of his orchestrations.  I just, I think that's what started to ground me in, in doing orchestrations as opposed to just playing piano, and also that was during the time of blaxploitation so I was listening to 'Shaft' and all the kinds, those kinds of sound scores as well.  So even though I was exposed a lot to R and B, it was, for me a lot of it was from the dramatic side that really appealed to me.  As a matter of fact, the first orchestration I ever did was for my high school jazz band and it was a cover of, of 'Shaft.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Isaac Hayes, then you got Barry White did some--
Speaker 2: Barry White, Curtis Mayfield, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: Right, right, exactly, exactly, yeah--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: So that's, that's what I grew up with.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That makes sense.
Story_ID: 672890
Speaker 1: How were your grades in high school [Shaw High School, East Cleveland, Ohio], basically--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: My grades sucked in high school, and I say that because by the time I, especially I think by my sophomore year, I had my own band, I was doing stuff at Karamu theater [Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio].  I was also playing for this group called The Singing Angels that travelled nationally and internationally.  I was playing for churches around town and, every once in a while somebody else would ask me to play for, for somebody else's theater, so that was a full-time job.  You know it's like, who had time for school.  It's like, I was tired and the good news was that I was, I think I was a pretty smart student, so I would never do the homework because I was too tired to do the homework, but because I went to class and I understood the stuff, I would get As on the tests, which meant that it averaged out to a C because they, because they weighted the, the homework so heavily, so, but there were, I mean I'm the first to say, I barely got out of high school because there were classes that I just didn't do well in.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now, now how did your parents feel about that?
Speaker 2: My parents were not happy at all.  It was a, you know we went back and forth about, about this whole music thing for that, for that reason.  You know education was very important to my parents, very, you know, as, as it is to, to every middle class parent but particularly to every middle class black parent.  When, when--there were a lot of times that my mother [Bernardine Murden Taylor] and my father [Waters' stepfather, Jack Waters] tried to keep me from doing too much.  I mean they, they never stopped me, but they, but certainly they were like, "You got to calm down, you have to get to your studies."  But also they had, you know, five other kids to look after so I kind of slipped under the radar, unfortunately quite a few times.  But I was the only one to actually go all the way through public school because she pulled, they pulled the other kids out and put them in parochial school because they figured it was a better education.  For me I fought that because even though it might have been a better educational environment, the whole arts things was not in the parochial schools and I, I absolutely enjoyed the whole extracurricular thing that I was doing in high school.
Story_ID: 672891
Speaker 1: Now one thing I have not asked you about--about is church.  Now were your--was your family (background noise), did--did your family belong to a church, and what role did you play--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: My family, they belonged to a Presbyterian church, and we went every Sunday.  It's, I don't claim to be a very religious person, but the, certainly I, I respect, I respect the religion in general, and I would go and by the time I was twelve actually, I was playing at my, at my family's church, so again, it was something else that just reinforced and, you know, and reinforced my ability to actually be a musician.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm just thinking, I don't know what the Presbyterians play but I imagine they play like traditional hymns, English type hymns and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Very, very traditional, so that was the other thing is that, I mean I was great for that because I, I could read just about any kind of piece of music, especially if it was, you know, that was relatively simple music to read.  It wasn't until I got to college [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina] that I was recruited to play for a gospel choir, and I had never played gospel before, so I kept trying to tell them I couldn't do this and they, there wasn't anybody else around.  The guy that was really fantastic, who's also from Cleveland [Ohio], Ronnie Williams [C. Ronald S. Williams II], he had just graduated.  So I told them I would give it a shot and, you know, and I listened to his records.  He was really, really a great musician and so I learned a lot of what I know about gospel from him as well as just from playing at that, for that choir.  It's like I tell people, you know, I'm the only musician I know that went to college to learn how to play gospel music.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Usually people bring it with them, right, when they come?
Speaker 2: Yep, exactly.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 672892
Speaker 1: Now you said you had your own band in high school [Shaw High School, East Cleveland, Ohio].  What was the name of your band?
Speaker 2: The name of my band was Life is Real and we used to play a lot of what they called the cabaret circuit.  Back then, it was, people would sponsor Saturday night parties and they would have like the alcohol setups and everything, and invite their friends.  They would pay us to come in and be the entertainment and, you know, it was, it wasn't a lot of money but we would make, you know, I think like thirty-five, forty dollars for a Saturday night in the '70s [1970s] was a lot of money for us, you know.
Speaker 1: Apiece?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: You know I mean, we're, you know, we're in high school, so we're like kings of the, of the high school cafeteria the next week, you know, so.  But, it was, they, it was another way to just experiment and explore and see what else I could do 'cause, of course, I had to do a lot of the arrangements for them as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were these mostly covers of pop songs, or?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, absolutely.  We weren't doing any original material but we were getting our name out there and we had a respect in the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any of the musicians that played with you go on to become professional --(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: They didn't go on to become professional musicians.  Well actually, one of them did, but I don't think he plays anymore.  Another one was my best friend who ended up deciding to become a teacher instead, a music teacher, and, you know, was very, very good at it.  And later in life he moved out to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] to try his hand in Vegas which, unfortunately, the scene in Vegas is nothing like it used to be so, you know, he's, he's still teaching.  But I'm the only one that, that really pursued it professionally.
Story_ID: 672893
Speaker 1: Tell us about Livingstone College.  Now you, that's an A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion] school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Salisbury, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did you end up choosing Livingstone--
Speaker 2: Actually--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --as a college?  And how did you, if your grades were kind of, I mean, though you're a music prodigy though.  I mean--that has to be weighed too.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause everybody probably knew this, that you were a good bet for a music education.
Speaker 2: Well, the only school I actually applied to for college was Carnegie Mellon [Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and, of course, because of my grades, they laughed at me.  My other choice was Berklee College [Berklee College of Music] in Boston [Massachusetts], because it, you know, it's a good music school.  Unfortunately, during that time, it was the time of segregation, of busing--you know they were trying, they were trying to break up segregation in the schools so they were starting to bus students in and I was looking at a Time magazine cover I believe with the, you know, the kids getting off the bus and just these angry mobs.  I'm like, "You know, I don't need this in the North." So ironically I ended up at a school in the South that they, my high school [Shaw High School, East Cleveland, Ohio] actually had a really, really good music department and the band director [Henry A. Duncombe, Jr.] from Livingstone was starting, he was trying to expand the, the marching band program down there, so they, he offered blanket scholarships and I just decided, you know, I'll try this for a year, I'll get my grades up, and then I'll reapply to, to you know, a school that's more music-oriented.  I got down there and it was, it was extreme culture shock.  But as it turns out, they ended up, because of my, because of my skills as an orchestrator, I ended up doing all of the arrangements for the marching band, or most of the arrangements for the marching band.  So all those tunes that would come on the radio every week, like,  you know, the latest Earth, Wind and Fire tune, the latest Cameo tune, whatever, I was the guy that was responsible for, for arranging them for our marching band for the following week, and that paid for four years of school for me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is a tradition in the black colleges [historically black colleges and universities]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --these bands that can take a popular song--
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: --and march to it and make it exciting on a football field (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, and the good news is that my scholarship was for writing the music for the band because god knows nobody would have wanted to see me dance on that field.  It's just, I, I just looked horrible.  I played a baritone horn.  It's like after piano and violin I wanted to play, you know, an instrument that, you know, actually had some (makes sound) to it, so I, I started playing trumpet and then I stated playing baritone horn and I did that for actually four years of college and four years of high school.  But, like I said, by my sophomore year in college I was basically just writing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was--I am the world's worst dancer which, you know a lot of times, people ask, "How can you arrange music for dance and you can't dance?"  And I'm like, "Folks, thank god it's two different skills."
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right, so you didn't do a lot of marching down there, you basically--basically wrote the arrangements, and--?
Speaker 2: I tried to.  I tried to be on the field but I didn't have to.  I certainly didn't have the kind of grueling practice schedule that everybody else did.
Speaker 1: Did you have anything to do with the formations?
Speaker 2: No, that was another, one of, somebody else from Cleveland [Ohio], a guy named C.J. Roberts [ph.], he would sit up with the band director and they would work all that stuff out.
Speaker 1: So did Livingston have a lot of students from Cleveland?
Speaker 2: At that time they did because there was only, there were only about a thousand, a thousand students in the school and he recruiting heavily from Cleveland because not only my program, but a couple of the high schools had really good music departments.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I mean most of the students came from North Carolina, but in terms of out of state students, we, yeah we were kind of up there in terms of, you know, being represented.
Story_ID: 672894
Speaker 1: Now did you--were there any special teachers or mentors at, in Livingstone [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Not--not musically.  I had, I had an English teacher.  Her name was Wilhelmina Boyd [K. Wilhelmina Boyd], and I used to hang out at her house all the time.  It was, she just, I don't know why, she just took me under her wing, so that was like my family.  I spent many a weekend over there.  I had many a meal with her and her family and she's one of the people that actually got me through school just because, like I said it's culture shock being down in Salisbury [North Carolina] after being in Cleveland [Ohio], just, just being that far away from home and from the things you're used to at home.  It just, it was just nice to have a second mother like that.
Story_ID: 672895
Speaker 1: So it wasn't anything really strange about Salisbury [North Carolina].  I mean it was just, it was way different that Clev- Cleveland [Ohio], is that--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: It was, I'm trying to say this nicely.  It was probably like Cleveland in the '50s [1950s].  I mean, you know, it, it really did feel like the old South in, in a way.  It's like, you know the only black people you saw, that I saw that I remembered at first were like, you know, I got off the bus and you know, there's like the black janitor, you know.  It wasn't until I hit the campus that I saw that there were, you know, that maybe there were, you know, black people that, that actually had, you know, respect- I, I, I'm not, I shouldn't say respectable jobs, but, you know, higher end jobs, and we were warned to, you know, just be a little careful down there.  It's, you know, it's--it was the South.
Speaker 1: Okay, I--
Speaker 2: And it was 1974.
Story_ID: 672896
Speaker 1: Something I just thought of and I hadn't, it didn't occur to me earlier, but in 1968 I think it was, Booker T. and the M.G.'s, or Booker T. [Booker T. Jones] scored the music for 'UpTight,' which is one of the first of the black movies about, you know, what's going on in the hood and that sort of thing.  It started Julian Mayfield, and, yeah, Max Julien--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And see that one, again, that's, that was just about the time I was starting to get involved so I wouldn't even, even have known about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't until, like I said, in the '70s [1970s] and in high school [Shaw High School, East Cleveland, Ohio] that it really slammed and hit me, but until that time, you know, '68 [1968] I would have been in what seven or eighth grade, so it was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so it was, I was just dipping my, my toe in the water.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because I mentioned it because it takes place in Hough, you know, in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: I got you.
Speaker 1: That's why, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I didn't, actually I did not know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, Hough was the setting, interesting.  Any rate I just said--that's right, Booker T. did that, and he, and the sound--the major song for it, "Time is Tight," is the theme, is the song he plays at the conclusion of every concert now.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: That's the one that everybody sings, it's not "Green Onions"--
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --it's "Time is Tight" (hums), you know.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Story_ID: 672897
Speaker 1: So any rate, so, now you were, you worked for a, a popular band in Cleveland [Ohio] and I don't have the name here, but it says you worked for a popular band in Cleveland, an R and B band.
Speaker 2: I did?  No, that wasn't me.
Speaker 1: You didn't?  Okay.  So, well you're, you go through all four years at Livingstone [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Without a--okay.  And was there anything special about graduation?
Speaker 2: Of course the most special thing was getting out of Salisbury [North Carolina].  That's--that's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you able to do any creative writing, you know, for theater productions, you know, when you were at Livingston.  Did they do that kind of thing there?
Speaker 2: They didn't, not really, although I have to say that every year at homecoming they had this, this talent show called the Startime Revue and it was just a chance for every student to show what they could do.  And I didn't do it, I think I played for somebody, maybe the second year, but my senior year they asked me if I would head it because the people that used to head it were gone, and I said, "Sure, but I need this, this," this in terms of, you know, it was going to be earlier than it had ever been before and, "I, I need for you to pay my guys, you know.  We're going to run it this way," and because I had in high school [Shaw High School, East Cleveland, Ohio] I had already done a million productions and, you know, the one group I told you I played with, The Singing Angels, you know, you know, we played for Bob Hope's seventieth birthday.  We, you know, they played for like Wayne Rogers and all these people, so I knew how stuff was supposed to be done professionally and I treated it like it was a Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] show.  So we did the show in less time and it was absolutely the most professional show that they'd ever seen.  I'm not just saying that, they're saying it to me.  So it's, you know, in terms of not theater per se, but in terms of seeing what I could do, you know, as a, you know, as a, a producer slash director type.  That, that gave me a lot of confidence.
Story_ID: 672898
Speaker 1: Now did you make any attempt to say contact [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones when you were in college [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina]--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: No.  I, you know, I've always been very shy about that kind of stuff.  Even, you know, to this day, it's, you know, I, I don't, I don't ask people to take pictures with me, you know.  I respect other people's--their space and their time.  I always feel that if there is something that I have, hopefully, you know, it's going to, if it's worth--if it's worth your while, you're gonna see if I put it out there period.  I'm not gonna, I don't, I just don't like, you know, buttonholing people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Now, having said that, I'd probably be much further in my career if I had, but, you know, it's, it's just who I am as a person.  I think, I have another friend who's a makeup artist down in Atlanta [Georgia] that I grew up with that she has the same issue.  She's like, "We, is it because we drank the water in Cleveland [Ohio] or what," I don't know, but, you know, we don't, we don't like approaching people that way.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I seen it happen both ways with someone's talent is--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --shines so much that those who, big names, reach out and contact them.  But--
Speaker 2: Right.  That's the way I'd like for it to happen.
Speaker 1: But yeah.  I think most people would idealize that but I've seen people who are only where they are because they were super aggressive.
Speaker 2: I have--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: They have no more talent than mediocre.  They're just more aggressive.
Speaker 2: I have absolutely seen that, yes (laughter)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yes. Okay. You said, "How did they get in"--
Story_ID: 672899
Speaker 1: After college [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina] what did you do?  Now you're, you're--you graduate in what nineteen--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: --seventy-eight [1978], okay.
Speaker 2: Right. I went back to Cleveland [Ohio].  I wasn't sure what I was going to do but I, I actually wanted to go to the West Coast and see if I could do film and TV, but I didn't really have any money and I just figured at least let me, you know, try and save up some money.  So I ended up, I mean, ironically it was one of the few times I had a job that was not a, not music related, when I was working at a country club parking cars just to have some extra bucks coming out of college.  I, you know, that did not make me very happy but luckily the guy that hired me was a family friend and, you know, he understood if I needed to take time off to go and actually do some music jobs.  So I spent three years in Cleveland and I, I was doing that, I was doing substitute teaching in the schools and I was doing other kinds of gigs, like pian- solo piano gigs for cocktail hours and I was working with a R and B band at night, and, you know, sometimes I was doing all that at the same, almost at the same time, so, it was--but what happened was I realized after about two years that those kind of jobs were all drying up.  The Holiday Inns, you know, you used to be able to actually like have a band and sit in a, in a restaurant, in a hotel lounge for like a couple of weeks at least and those gigs were disappearing.  They were going to deejays.  So I had a friend that I had played for in Cleveland who had moved to New York [New York] with her boyfriend, and she kept trying to tell me I need to move to New York, and eventually she convinced me, it was her--once again, she was like, she was somebody I grew up with.  Elaine [ph.], she was just, she was the star of all of the high school shows and when she moved here, she just, she realized that I actually could probably make a living here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is, this is like the disco era.  Is that why the deejays were dominating the club scene?
Speaker 2: Exactly, yep, yep.  Just, yeah, we were just coming into the disco era.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But also it was just, you know, it was also just cheaper.  I don't know what was, I don't know if there's a mini recession or something.  I'm not sure what happened that made that technological change, but those gigs were definitely drying up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you, during the funk days, did you have a favorite band, funk band?
Speaker 2: Well, not funk per se, but Earth, Wind and Fire by far is my favorite band.  It's, and they influence a lot of what I do as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Especially, I mean the horn section is just absolutely amazing.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  So your friend Elaine talked you into moving to New York so you saved your money and moved in '81 [1981]?
Speaker 2: I did, and she, she helped me find a place.  I mean I spent my first, probably year, year and a half moving around from sublet to sublet, you know.  I packed two suitcases because I knew I was going to be moving and, you know, but there was also a pretty good Cleveland connection here as well, because a lot of people from Karamu [Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio] actually moved to New York, so I started making connections that way as well.
Speaker 1: So who was there from Karamu that you knew?
Speaker 2: Well Gina Taylor [Gina Taylor-Pickens] was, who is married to Jim Pickens [James Pickens Jr.], she started introducing me to a lot of people and one of the, one the people she introduced me to became my first real client, Terry Burrell, who went on to do 'Dreamgirls,' and from there it's, you know, it's like this business.  It's like if you, if you get a good reputation, if people like your work, you know, it just keeps spreading.
Story_ID: 672900
Speaker 1: All right.  So New York City [New York, New York], and was it just like you pictured it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Actually, I had, I had visited New York once when I was seventeen.  I had a high school teacher that took me and another student up to his place in Connecticut with his, with his family for his family vacation, and we spent a day here in New York, and it was nothing like what I pictured.  It was dirty, it was noisy, construction was everywhere.  People were everywhere and I felt like I was breathing fresh air for the first time in my life.  It's like I loved New York that much just from that day.  And as a matter of fact, that night we saw our first Broadway show.  I mean we went everywhere.  I don't know how we managed to get the Statute of Liberty [New York, New York], to the top of the, of Rockefeller Center [New York, New York], but that evening we went to see a Broadway show.  It was the first show I'd ever seen obviously, on Broadway.  And it was called 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope.'  And--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --it was, it was beyond all my expectations in terms of the whole professionalism and, of course, the fact it was a black show on Broadway.  And I focused on the music director Danny Holgate and it was, I think it was, that would have been my ah ha moment in terms of I can do this, I can actually make a living as a music director or working in theater.  And as a matter of fact by the time I moved to New York, or after I moved to New York, I had contacted him and he became one of my, one of my mentors in terms of being able to find jobs.  He, people came to him for jobs all the time, so there was a lot of stuff that he just couldn't handle and he would pass some of it off to me and, you know, he would give me advice on what to do, what not to do.  And one of the main things he said is never turn down a job (laughter).  You know I mean you can't take them all, but he was like, if at all possible, do not turn down a job because you just never know in this business.
Speaker 1: So this is Danny--
Speaker 2: Danny Holgate, yes.
Speaker 1: Holgate, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  That's--
Speaker 2: And he's, I mean he was just one of the top guys, particularly at that time you know.  He also did, was musical director for 'Eubie!' as well.
Story_ID: 672901
Speaker 1: You got a job as a house pianist at a Manhattan [New York] dessert club it says here, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The, that was a place called Something Different [ph.] and it was really something different.  It was, it was a dessert club, night club with singing waiters and waitresses, so when they weren't like slinging cappu- you know cappuccinos and cannolis, they were on stage singing.  And I was the, one of three house pianists.  So we would alternate nights.  But it was just a constant barrage of new material coming at you because they were coming with new stuff that they wanted to try out and it was, you know, it was a good training ground, particularly for, you know, just learning a lot of musical theater stuff that I didn't know before.  But they also did a lot of pop songs as well so I got a pretty, you know, well-rounded education there.  I mean that place was, when I working there, that place was open seven nights a week and there were like lines around the block on, particularly on the weekend, to like two, three o'clock in the morning.  It was, I don't know what the attraction was.  There was no alcohol, it was just desserts.  And they would have to turn over the room every hour so they could get the next group of people in, but it was, it's the job that actually kept me in New York for three years.  It became my main job for three years and it was the one that saved me from having to go back to Cleveland [Ohio] actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what is this, this kind of like a Broadway 101, I mean in a way--
Speaker 2: In essence it was.  And not to mention, part of the reason it was, that it was, that it was as popular as it was is that there were a lot of good performers that came through there.  It's, you know, people that eventually ended up doing much more than singing waiters and waitresses.  I mean one of my, one of my favorite people there was Saundra Santiago who went on to do 'Miami Vice.'  The pianist actually, there's a guy that used to alternate with me, Lon Hoyt, who's--who does more Broadway shows than I do.  Another guy that played piano there was Mike Skloff [Michael Skloff] who wrote the theme song for 'Friends.'  You know so it's like this was, these people were no slouches.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So people would, the waiters and I guess the wait staff that did the singing were aspiring--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Broadway performers.
Speaker 2: Right.  And that was, it was part of the good thing about, good things about that gig because it meant that if they were off doing a show for six months or something, they know, they knew they could come back and still have a job in between until their next show.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So three years.
Story_ID: 672902
Speaker 1: Now in '83 [1983] you were hired as an onstage pianist for a European tour of 'Ain't Misbehavin'' [Murray Horwitz and Richard Maltby, Jr.], right?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the Fats Waller musical.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  That was my first time out the country and it was my first time doing music that was even harder than Chopin [Frederic Chopin] could ever be.  It's, because I hadn't been used to doing the stride piano.  It was like all this kind of stuff (gestures).
Speaker 1: Yeah that's been supposed to be one of the most difficult styles to play, that's what I heard from everybody--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's extremely difficult and I'm just glad I survived it.  It's, I mean I, you know, I, I learned a lot, as always, you know, from that particular kind of gig, and it was my, my introduction actually to, to the world in terms of wanting to be, in terms of being more curious about it even.  We spent, we spent about a month in Finland.  I mean every town we went to was smaller and smaller but it's between that and then bouncing over to, where did we go?  We went to France and we were in England.  It was just, you know, subconsciously you start cataloging how people are different, and, more importantly, how people are the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any stories from, say, the stay in Finland?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean we started in Helsinki [Finland] and I mean, unfortunately, my biggest story from there is that I, I was hoping that I would be able to go over to St. Petersburg [Russia], which wasn't that far away and, unfortunately, that happened to be the time that Russia decided they were gonna like shoot down a Korean airline [Korean Air Lines Flight 007], so that wasn't gonna happen.  But the, the, again, it was just interesting to see how people related to, you know, to our show.  Obviously, they loved the show, but then afterwards, just to see the love coming off the stage from people, it's, it, you know, it harkens back to the time when, you know, jazz artists in the, in an earlier age used to say, you know, "I'm not coming back to America because it's like they love what we do over here."
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  So some big following in Finland, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you learn any Finnish?
Speaker 2: I learned, (speaking Finnish) "kiitos," thank you, that's it.  Outside of that, I was done.
Story_ID: 672903
Speaker 1: So you are a piano on stage now.  This is a Fats Waller musical, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Ain't Misbehavin'' [Murray Horwitz and Richard Maltby, Jr.]?  So someone else can play piano too?
Speaker 2: No, I'm playing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, just you? Okay, 'cause you played, and the--
Speaker 2: The whole band was on stage.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the character, was there a character playing Fats Waller?
Speaker 2: The way that, 'Ain't Misbehavin',' which was conceived by Richard Maltby [Richard Maltby, Jr.], what he, what he wanted was the five people on stage actually, the five performers on stage, were actually, were actually each a different part of Fats' personality, so each vignette kind of stood on its own and each performer might take on an aspect of his personality during that particular number.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So what aspect of his personality did you play?
Speaker 2: I played the part, I played the aspect where the Fats could play the piano (laughter).  But I mean some of those other guys, you know Fats was really funny.  He was a very funny guy.  So, it's like, you know, you got songs like "Your Feet's Too Big," you know, and you've got, you know, the, what is it, the, "The Ladies Got Swing" [sic. "Ladies Who Sing With the Band"].  I forget exactly what it's called, but, you know, this girl that really can't sing, but it's like by the time you get finished theatricalizing all this stuff, it's a really entertaining show.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So now, so you were with that for two years I guess, right?
Speaker 2: No, actually I was, I caught the last part of the tour.  They'd been out for a long time.  I caught like the last two months of it actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were only out for two, two months?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In that regard I've actually been very, as far as I'm concerned, I've been very fortunate in my life.  It's like a lot of people have to spend a lot of time out on the road because, you know, it pays the bills for them.  And, to be fair, there are people that love being on the road, so, it's, you know, it's not a big deal to them.  For me, I feel I've been fortunate that I've only had to be out no longer than two months at any given time throughout the course of my career.  You know, for me, I, I love being at home.  So it's, you know, I, I, again I'm just very fortunate.
Story_ID: 672904
Speaker 1: The next project that we have information about, well what was the next project, rather than me giving you one?
Speaker 2: After 'Ain't Misbehavin'' [Murray Horwitz and Richard Maltby, Jr.] I came back, I probably, I probably was still playing a little bit at the dessert night club [Something Different (ph.), New York, New York], but the next real project guess would have been, the next step up for me would have been a show called 'A...My Name is Alice,' off Broadway, and the guy I told you about, Mike Skloff [Michael Skloff], that wrote the theme for 'Friends,' he was the music director for that and he was leaving, so he wanted, he asked me to take his place as music director and, again, it's another stepping stone and I'm not sure how, but from there, I also started, started working with Michael Peters who was, you know, Michael Jackson's choreographer for "Thriller," and a couple other of his videos, so we were doing, and that actually became my first Broadway show.  It was a show called 'Leader of the Pack' [Anne Beatts].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  'Leader of the Pack.'  Now this is a, so Michael Peters did the choreography for this?
Speaker 2: He was the director and the choreographer, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Director, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And just a great guy.  I mean I, you know, I, I couldn't have had a better, a nicer person as a, as a first director on Broadway.
Speaker 1: Now did the, I have to ask this question after seeing the, I saw the music video "Beat It," you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it was a gang type, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Does that come directly from 'Leader of the Pack' or does it, is it influenced by that, or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --same--
Speaker 2: No.  But that was, I mean people, you know, it's a shame that Michael is not recognized more for what he's done.  I mean besides being choreographer of 'Dreamgirls,' he's, you're not taking anything away from Michael Jackson to say that it was Michael Peters' choreography that people are to this day on Halloween everybody is doing that "Thriller" dance.  That was, that was all Michael Peters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And everybody I know, yeah.  I have in-laws that could, all of them could do it, from age three to age seventy-five.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Can--right, okay.  So 'Leader of the Pack,' this is a, from the song, (singing) "That's why they called him the leader of the pack."
Speaker 2: Right.  It was a, it was a jukebox musical basically following Ellie Greenwich, Ellie Greenwich's life.  Darlene Love was in it, Patrick Cassidy, and it was, it, you know, the show had problems, but it was just a lot of fun to do, and, again, you know, I just, I met people that, you know I still to this day actually still talk to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it didn't, it didn't run long, but it was a Broadway production.
Speaker 2: No, Broadway is a tough little animal.  It's like, you know, you, there's just no telling.  It's, you know, the, and, and you try a million different ways to try and try and get a show, not just up and running because you need a million producers, particularly today, but also you have a preview period where you can change things around and see if things work a little bit better this way, but ultimately if you don't satisfy your audience, for whatever reason, it's just, it's not gonna stay open.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you play the role of associate conductor in this one, right?
Speaker 2: I was the associate conductor on the show, yes.
Speaker 1: And what responsibility does the associate conductor have?
Speaker 2: Well, I was also the, the second keyboard player, so I was one of the first people actually to use a synthesizer on Broadway, but when the conductor was out, that means it was my responsibility to actually conduct this Broadway show, and the first time that happened, you know, I was strolling in at my usual time, probably about fifteen minutes before the show, and they tell me that I'm actually gonna be conducting.  And I'm like in a panic 'cause I had no idea this was happening.  This was happening during the previews and normally you don't have the associate conductor conduct during previews.  So, but, I mean, I, I, I knew what I was doing because, you know, I, I just, I, I wanted to be prepared.  It's like my whole life I'd been told always be prepared.  So, and it went great, but, you know, it was still like, you know, until that last downbeat and, you know, and the curtain closes, it's like you don't know what can happen that can go wrong.  And luckily, nothing did.  Everything actually went very right.
Story_ID: 672905
Speaker 1: As a conductor, what can go wrong?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Everything (laughter).
Speaker 1: People have the music, and you are responsible for--
Speaker 2: Well, the, the problem is that we're all human.  So, you know, an actor on stage can miss their line, you know, they can forget what the lyric is.  A dancer can get caught in a piece of scenery.  God forbid that should happen, but, you know, it's like things just happen.  A lot of times you might have substitute players in the orchestra and they don't, they miss their cue.  I mean things just happen and as a music conductor, you have to constantly be looking around the corner just like a train conductor.  It's like you got to know what, you have to have some idea how to prepare for whatever might happen down the road.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  For instance, say I'm out there tap dancing and I break my leg or something, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, in that, in that case the curtain just comes down, but (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Say I just sprained my ankle, or I make a--
Speaker 2: Well, there are times that--there are times that you have to decide, do you, do you move on in the music or do you stay in this particular vamp and hope that, you know, hope that they can work out whatever the problem is.  In particular, like I said, if somebody forgets, forgets their lyric and they're not coming in right, it's like you have to re-cue a whole orchestra to catch them.  Sometimes you don't get the right cue, the right word cue, from, you know, from, from a performer and you have to just make a decision, am I going to wait for it and hope that he gets it, or do I just go with the music now?  It's, you know, the conductor, as much as a stage manager, really controls the pace of the show.
Speaker 1: So if there's a gaff, do you have like prearranged bridges, I guess, in the music that you--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: You just keep, you keep on playing one thing until they, the thing--
Speaker 2: You hope you can communicate to the players where you all are.  There is gonna be, especially if you're not already sitting, you know, in a vamp.  There are places in the music where there are repeats that, you know, that are, that you know you're gonna be sitting in, but a lot of times, there's not, and there are times when you just have to be able to communicate, and until, until everybody gets back together, it's just, you know, there's gonna be a little chaos, but a lot of times you're working with people that are so professional that they're always listening, they're always watching, and it's generally not that long.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But even, you know, I mean, somebody comes in on the wrong note, somebody comes in in the wrong key, it's, all you can do is just keep pushing through.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I, you know, I mean one of the, I know you're talking about, you're talking about theater now, but one of the main things that I had to deal with when I was dealing with, with [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt, was she has a million lyrics to have to remember and she's human, she's not gonna remember them all the time, so I have to figure out when do I move on the with the music, when do I move to the next song, or, you know, whatever.  And it's a, in other words, the great thing about theater or about any live performance is that it really is a living organism.
Story_ID: 672906
Speaker 1: That being said, this is time--it's time to talk about [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt.
Speaker 2: (Gestures) (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You, all right, so, so you served as music director for Eartha Kitt Productions starting, well you were that since at least 1995, but you, you met her in '86 [1986], right?  Or did you start working with her in 1986--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: I started working with her in, I actually don't remember if it was '86 [1986] or '87 [1987], but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it would have been like the end of '86 [1986] or the beginning of '87 [1987], but we had, I had worked with, with a percussionist who was, who had, was working on some new material with her for, with a couple of dancers, the Williams brothers [ph.], and he had recommended me to her as somebody that could do the dance arrangements for them.  So I agreed to meet and she walked into the rehearsal room and, you know, I only knew her really from Catwoman, so I'm looking at this woman who I, on television, looked six feet tall, and she's really, you know, she came up to like maybe my neck.  And she walks across the room with her entourage, and, you know, then she opens her mouth and she even sounds like Catwoman.  I, I thought that was just a character voice, I had no idea that was her real voice, so then, I'm already like smiling to myself trying to keep from laughing.  I'm absolutely amused, but then she asked me questions about, you know, "Do you know how to play a samba, do you know how to play, you know, salsa, can you play a beguine," and I'm like, "Yes Miss Kitt, yes Miss Kitt," and then I said something like, I was getting ready to ask her a question, I said, "Miss Kitt," and she said, "Call me Eartha," and then she did her double take and said, "On second thought call me Miss Kitt until I decide whether I like you or not."  And I started laughing.  It was just funny to me, and she said, "Finally, somebody that gets my sense of humor."  And from there we just really hit it off and she asked me, maybe a couple of weeks later if I wanted to be her music director, and, we went strong for like twenty-two years after that.
Speaker 1: Gee whiz, that's--now, now what show was she working on in '86 [1986], '87 [1987]?
Speaker 2: It was, she was always, when I was working with her she was always doing her own act, so it was like, I, I'm not gonna say a Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] style how, but a cabaret style show.  So we were always fashioning material for her and it was always her one woman show.  I don't know if you've ever seen her perform her own stuff live, but, I mean, she's, she really is--
Speaker 1: I've never seen her live, but I--
Speaker 2: Man, you missed the force of nature.  Whether we were on, performing with a symphony or it was just me, it was--she held the stage.  I mean it was, it didn't matter whether you were at The Carlyle [New York, New York] which is like maybe a large living room in essence.  Or if we were sitting at, you know, Symphony Hall, it's, you were just mesmerized by everything she did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I know in the '80s [1980], I think she was doing a show called 'Timbuktu!' [Luther Davis] do you, were you involved with that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Correct.  That was, actually that was in late, I wanna say late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay, that was before you got with her.
Speaker 2: It was before I got with her, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 672907
Speaker 1: And it was her, it was her real return to New York [New York], after, of course--to the United States after all the brouhaha with Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] when, you know, she insulted Lady Bird [Lady Bird Johnson] and basically got herself, you know, exiled from the country professionally.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think she disagreed with Lady Bird about a civil rights issue or something.
Speaker 1: Very vocally she disagreed and, yes, the next day basically she was no longer working in the United States.  The good news is that, you know, she was, they loved her across the world and the even better news is as a result of that I saw a lot of places that I never would have seen if I was not with that woman.  I mean she was, I mean, you know, when we would, we, I actually, I think I hit all six continents with her.  I, I just wish that, you know, there some penguins that would have hired her, I would have loved to go to Antarctica.
Speaker 2: Okay.  She, she had an international flavor to her work.  She was from like South Carolina, right?
Speaker 1: She was from South Carolina, but she spent a lot of time in France and I think, more importantly, I didn't, I didn't realize this myself until I'd been with her a few years because I, I heard Marlene Dietrich in some, you know, in background music in a restaurant and I thought it was Eartha [HistoryMaker Eartha Kitt], and it occurred to me, you know, duh, she was very much influenced by her and by Edith Piaf.  So it's, you know, that whole international thing was, you know, I mean she, she justifiably earned it because, you know, that's who she'd been listening to.  It's like what we all do.  We all have--are influenced by our, by styles from other people.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I mean, I think that Josephine Baker had a similar kind of--
Speaker 1: She did.
Speaker 2: --following in Europe--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: She did.  It wasn't, and Josephine, I, I, I'd have to say Josephine was, again, another very unique individual, but obviously very unique in a very different way from Eartha.  I mean Eartha was, Eartha was, was, I, I don't, I can't even describe it.  It's, it's, there's a sensuality, a sexuality and an intelligence and just in terms of an audience, she, every night, even if we did the same songs, it was, it was a different performance because she was reacting to her audience.  There's a lot of performers that would do it absolutely the same thing every night no matter who the audience is.  She was not one of those people.
Speaker 2: Okay.  'Cause she had a, it seemed to me she had an international kind of, it wasn't just international but it was from the, it was Pan-African in a sense.
Speaker 1: There was a lot of that and I, I'm not sure I would say Pan-African more, as much as Afro Caribbean.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because she did a lot of, she loved the beat, period.  It's--you know, Latin--she did lots of Latin material.  She did lots of, I mean one of her favorite, one of her most famous songs was 'Angelitos Negros,' but she, she, it was very rare that we did a show without using a percussionist.  She loved, you know, the sound of, you know, congas and, you know, and bongos, all that stuff.  It's just, it--that's what motivated her.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: And she was a dancer, so, of course, that had a, that played a lot into it too, especially with her years growing up as a [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham dancer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I know she was a regular on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' way show back in the day, yeah they'd bring her on and she--in some ways, I mean she and [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, what I meant by Pan-African is probably the same thing that you talked about, that you're saying, Afro Caribbean, but spanning Africa, the Caribbean and the United States--
Speaker 1: Correct, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --linking the black entertainment, I mean styles for those countries--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.  And no just, not just them, that's what I, that's what I discovered when I went around the world with her, is, you know, it's, that's, that's where it kind of starts but it also spreads, it's like you know when we went to New Zealand.  It's, you know, like looking at Maori rhythms, the Philippine rhythms, any, you know, any kind of indigenous people, it's like there is, there's this common thread that she managed to bring all together into what she was doing.
Story_ID: 672908
Speaker 1: Did working with her like stretch your--?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, I, you know, I had no idea what Philippine music sounded like so (laughter).  But also, she, she made me stretch because she was, even if we would, like I said, sometimes when we were putting together new shows, she would want to add new material and, but she'd have to find a new way to do it, so that meant I had to find an new way to do it.  So, you know, I mean it's, you know, that was, the thing about us is like any good vocal and accompanist team, after a while it's a marriage, it's, hopefully it's a good marriage, but it's like you know each other, you can read each other's thoughts and hopefully you can complete each other's sentences, you know, metaphorically speaking, on the stage.
Speaker 1: What was the repertoire, you know, typically like?
Speaker 2: It was all over the place.  I mean we did, and it depended again, on the year, but there were certain, there were certain songs we would pretty always do.  'I'm Still Here,' which is a Sondheim [Stephen Sondheim] tune, was basically made for her in terms of the whole statement of no matter what, I'm still here.  No matter what you've done to me.  We got a tune from Artie Butler called 'Here's to Life' which, I think it was Shirley Horn eventually did with strings, but she, he gave it to Eartha first.  He just, he didn't care for our arrangement because he was looking for a hit ballad.  And it's, it is the way he wrote it, it's a nice very beautiful slow ballad, but because we were using it to end her show, we wanted some energy, some exuberance to it, so we took the whole thing, very much up tempo so it became a song of celebration.  It's--and that became one of our, one of our staples as well.  Then, of course, there's stuff like 'C'est Si Bon' that you can't get away from because it's one of her hits from like fifty, sixty, seventy years ago.  But she also did a lot of dramatic material.  So there was very little, there's very little down time in between each one of her songs, she wanted to move from one thing to the next because it was all basically telling her, telling a story.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so, [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt, when you knew her was, when we started, she was how old in '87 [1987] would you think?
Speaker 2: Let's see, '87 [1987], I think she was born in, now you're gonna get me to lie.  Let me back it up.  She died, she was eighty-one when she died right?  So, and she died in eighty--I'm sorry she died in 2008, so she was like, you know usually my math skills are better than this, but she would have been, I'm gonna say somewhere around like fifty-nine, sixty.
Story_ID: 672909
Speaker 1: I guess it was like maybe 1991 [sic. 1992] she [HistoryMaker Earth Kitt] was in the movie 'Boomerang.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That was the first movie she'd been in in a long time.
Speaker 2: Right.  What's interesting was watching how this woman has reinvented herself for different generations.  You know, like I said I know her from Catwoman.  There are people that are older than me that remember her from 'Anna Lucasta' and 'New Faces.'  And then you had this new generation from 'Boomerang.'  Then you had the generation after that from 'The Emperor's New Groove.'  It's like, it was just amazing.  I just hope I can have something close to that kind of longevity in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was she like, I mean she's such a great star, and you were with her so long?
Speaker 2: She was a really, well first of all, she, she really was like my mother, in terms of, she treated me like her son.  And I remember at The Carlyle [New York, New York], especially the last few years, she would always bring me fried chicken and greens because she knew that I liked it and I wasn't cooking for myself at that time, so, (laughter) she would bring.  And she had her own, she liked to be in the earth for real, so she would, she made her own vegetables.  I mean she grew her own vegetables.  She liked being at home and she, she liked nature, period.  It's, you know, the road is what she had to do and when she was on the road, she, she certainly tried to take advantage of whatever she could in terms of exploring and meeting new people, doing new things.  But whenever she could, she, we would go, we might, if we had a gig tomorrow night, we'd leave tomorrow morning and we'd come back the next day because she just wanted to be in her own bed.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right.  Now through, through years of collaboration with her, you also did other work too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And that was one of the great things about being with her because, I mean, you know, she understood that, you know, it's, you have to grow as an artist and sometimes that means, you know, doing other things as well, which is what she did.  She didn't, there were times when she couldn't take me because she was doing theatrical productions as well.
Story_ID: 672910
Speaker 1: Next note I have is about 'Jelly's Last Jam' [George C. Wolfe]. Who's that--was that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Was there something before that we need to talk about, or is this--?
Speaker 2: Let's see, that was probably like the next big step up for me just in terms of, of a, of a hit show that actually, you know, ran for longer than two seconds.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Once again you're an associate conductor--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for 'Jelly's Last Jam' on Broadway and it ran, I guess for--
Speaker 2: It didn't run, it ran like maybe like a year and half, maybe tops, but it was, that's when I met Luther Henderson and he was like a link to, to Duke Ellington.  You know so it's like I was grabbing that kind of, that kind of knowledge at that time.  Also, it was the second collaboration with my pal George Wolfe [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe] who, you know, just amazing theater director.  We had, our first collaboration was a show called 'Colored Museum' ['The Colored Museum,' George C. Wolfe] in the mid-'80s [1980s], it was off Broadway, but on this one he asked me to come on board to, to, I mean it was Luther's gig.  Luther was the adapter, the orchestrator, but at this time Luther was, was getting pretty old, so George wanted me to help, you know, smooth things over in terms of making, making things run quicker.  It's--George is really impatient, he can be.  So, I mean not in a bad way but he can certainly, when--he wants things as soon as possible, and he knew that I could facilitate that process.  And to that, to that end I actually ended up doing a lot of the, I did, I actually did all of the arrangements for the dance sections of the show, and the orchestrations.  It's like I was in the room with Gregory Hines and [HistoryMaker] Savion Glover as they're creating this stuff, so it was easy for me to just notate it and then turn it into music.  So it was just, you know, it was just one of those really great collaborations in terms of seeing how people work.  Susan Birkenhead, who was the lyricist, George would throw something at her and she would spit out these amazing lyrics like, you know, two seconds later.  So that was my first time being involved in the, you know, in the whole process of how a show gets put together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On Broadway at least.
Speaker 1: Okay now, once again this was a show that rescues the music of a black composer--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and entertainer of the past.
Speaker 2: Yep, Jelly Roll Morton.
Speaker 1: Jelly Roll Morton, a man who never got a chance to do a Broadway show or anything like that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but, you know, was a legend in the clubs and so forth.  Like Fats Waller-(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's a period that--right.  It's a period that, yeah, it's a period that George has a, George Wolfe, has a real fascination with for good reason.  It's an amazing time for not just America, but for black America when we're talking about the '20s [1920s], close to Renaissance [Harlem Renaissance] times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is, you got Gregory Hines and Savion Glover in there, so.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: This is a young Savion Glover.
Speaker 2: Very, very young.
Speaker 1: Yep. Gregory--
Speaker 2: Yes.  But he was, you know it's like sitting in those rehearsals, I was, you know, I'm like the guy that's responsible for making sure that the music gets done and I'm watching Gregory and Savion basically just trying to out tap each other and Savion is doing more amazing things every second.  I, if, you know how you can see a drummer do a drum roll and he's using two hands and he's going (makes sound).  Savion and would take his foot, one foot, and do that (makes sound), and Gregory would just have to say, "You got it man.  It's like, it's, you got it."  So it was, it was watching that kind of stuff, watching the horseplay between them that turned into these like brilliant dances, these brilliant tap dance sections, and inspiring me to come up with, you know, music that hopefully would, would help to, you know, to underscore, underscore that, those moments.  So, again, it was another time where I just, I got my own, another step up in my own confidence of knowing that I can do this on a Broadway stage for people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is a show that ran five hundred and sixty-nine performances.
Speaker 2: It did?  Wow.
Speaker 1: That's what it says here, at, the Virginia Theatre [August Wilson Theatre, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And how many were you, were you involved in--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: I would have been there for the whole thing except for the, except for the week that I got married.  I, that was a very busy period for me.  It's, it was like, you know, my, my wife [Tracey Waters] and I spent time down in, I mean, you know, we had to take a honeymoon but (laughter), but it was a really good time in my life because I was working with this show with all these extremely talented people.  I'd, you know, just gotten married, we bought a house together.  It was probably, I'd have to say it was probably the, the best period overall of my, you know, of my hopefully much longer life.
Story_ID: 672911
Speaker 1: Now how did you meet your wife [Tracey Waters]?
Speaker 2: I met her actually, George [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe] and I were, well I was working with George on another show down at the Kennedy Center [The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.], and this would have been maybe about the same time I, as I was working with Eartha [HistoryMaker Eartha Kitt], as I started working with Eartha.  And she was a replacement dancer coming in and I was actually going out because they had to use local musicians.  I had been the second keyboard player on the show when it was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And un-, but because I was the only one that really knew the music, I had, I was teaching it to all these new dancers coming in, and she just kind of caught my eye and we started dating and, you know, before you know it, we, as far as I'm concerned, we were married in the blink of an eye, even though it was actually like about six years later, and after I had, as she said, I had acted right for a year or so.  But, but, again, it was just a really, really great period in my life.
Story_ID: 672912
Speaker 1: Now what is the, what is life like doing a Broadway show?  What's your typical day like, doing one of these five hundred--one day in these five hundred and sixty-two performances that you were in, minus that seven-day trip?
Speaker 2: Well, the thing about Broadway is there's two separate, there's two separate halves you have to look at.  The, the, the pre-opening, which is crazy.  It's, you know, you're rehearsing eight hours a day, six days a week, and I mean, you're rehearsing hard a lot of times.  And then there's, you know, post opening where basically you just have to be at the theater for the show.  So, you go from like these forty-eight hour days, and even longer because, of course, it doesn't stop, this is not nine-to-five, it's like you're, you're going over everything in your head at home, you're, you know, you have extra work that you have to do to be prepared for the next day long after you've left, you know, the rehearsal space.  But once the show opens, you basically are there for what, a show is two and a half hours on average long, eight shows a week, you, you got a twenty hour work week, in essence, that you're paid relatively well for.  If you are an understudy to one of the lead roles, you might come in and you'll do like a four hours, four hours to maybe eight hours rehearsal per week on a Thursday and a Friday.  And that's basically it.  So, so the, the post opening thing is what everybody looks forward to obviously because then finally your life is freed up again to do other projects, to, you know, to, to sleep in, to catch up on all that rest that you didn't have, and you also at that point can start talking about taking vacation time as well.  So, the, the, the post-opening thing, especially if you're with the group of people you love, it's just the absolute best time in the world.  It's like you're--you come in, and outside of doing your show, people are like, you know, having birthday parties and, you know, it is, it's all the glamour part that everybody thinks Broadway is, but they don't see all the other stuff you have to do to get there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  It does seem to be like a very tight group of people.  I mean those that do perform, you know, in these shows, they all seem to know each other and have a tight bond.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, especially, I mean, you know, it's, Broadway world is a, is a very small community relatively speaking, particularly if, you know, if you have the talent to be there in the first place, you know, people will have seen you some place before.
Story_ID: 672913
Speaker 1: 'Jelly's Last Jam' [George C. Wolfe], incidentally, was nominated for thirteen Tony Awards [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] and thirteen Drama Desk Awards, so, had great reviews, but in 1995 you're part of groundbreaking show called 'Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk' [Reg E. Gaines].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Bring in 'da Noise' was one of those shows that--I, you know, I wasn't, I wasn't sure if I was the right person for it, you know, I told that to George [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe].  I was, you know, he was like, "We're doing this show with hip hop, and, you know, and tap dancing," and I was, I was still out with Eartha [HistoryMaker Eartha Kitt] and I had a pretty full schedule, so part of my reluctance was, you know, knowing that I would have to find somebody to replace me during the time that we were doing this show, but as it turns out, you know, I approached Eartha about it and she said, "Sure, you know, you gotta do what you gotta do," and I'm, I could not be happier with the results in terms of, you know, we started off, I think we had a month of, of a workshop, and at the end of that month, we had maybe, I think twenty-eight minutes, not even thirty minutes worth of material for a brand new show, and the brand new show was going up off Broadway like, I forget, like maybe six months later.  So, over the course of maybe another, I want to say six to eight weeks, we came up with enough material to open off Broadway and we got great reviews.  And the thing that was, again it's one of those things where you're looking at the process and you, and you, and you're thinking how did, how did we even do this because six to eight weeks, and even with the extra month that I talked about, using for, for, you know, to come up with the initial twenty-eight minutes, Broadway shows take anywhere from like, you know, two to seven years to get up, and we basically did this in a little bit, in somewhere around six months.  And from that time to the time that we actually went to Broadway, was not, we, we didn't really change that much and I think, I'm trying to think, I believe we kept all the same material, but, and, you know, just, it just got bigger and it got more enhanced by going to Broadway.  But, I mean, it was as George said, you know, basically we were channeling.  We weren't writing, we were just channeling some, you know, some spirits from beyond to get this show up like this.
Story_ID: 672914
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is--well tell us something.  Now you composed and orchestrated and supervised the music for this production ['Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk,' Reg E. Gaines].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now this is a turn, the first time you had official responsibility for doing all these things, right?
Speaker 2: For doing all those things, on Broadway, yes.  The, again, we were, the whole process was very organic and actually the fact that I was doing all that, in a sense made it easier than having to figure out, you know, as the composer, how do I explain this what I need to a separate orchestrator and a separate arranger.  It's like it was all in my head, and actually I should state that I was one of three composers, Zane Mark and Ann Duquesnay were the other two composers on the show.  And we all, basically we all just kind of like threw everything in a pot and this is what we came up with.  But, there was, I remember, I remember at one point just thinking that it's just, it's almost writing itself in a sense, just because, again, I think on this one we were channeling and we were moving so fast we didn't, we didn't have time to think beyond initial thoughts.  You know it's like, get it up and if we need to change stuff, we can change it in previews, but in the meantime, a lot of the stuff we ended up with really was, I--our first instincts were so, were so great that that's what we stayed with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, all right, so (pause) what's your, this is like a historical panorama basically, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, you had to compose songs to cover various genres of historical times, right?  And--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So this is a, so all the past experiences of yours, you know, the way you describe it so far, seemed to have prepared you well to do this.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, and, I mean, it's, it's theater so we could, we could take a little bit of license, but, you know, if you're doing a little bit of hip hop, you got to do a little hip hop.  If you're doing 1940s movie musicals, you got to sound like a 1940s movie musical.  And the other challenge for this was with this particular show, even when we moved to Broadway, I think we only used seven musicians, so, you know, you're trying to cover a, a huge soundscape as well as, you know, as well as a lot of different styles.  And, you know, I was, I actually was very proud with the results.  I mean, you know, are there things I would have done differently?  Absolutely, especially with the kind of technology we have now, but for what we had to cover going from, you know, 1700s all the way up to, at that time, 1996, I, I think that we did a really, really great job.
Speaker 1: It was really a energetic show.
Speaker 2: Oh you saw it, good.
Speaker 1: I've seen clips of it, I've never, I never saw it on stage.
Speaker 2: Got you.
Speaker 1: But I've seen clips of it, once again you got [HistoryMaker] Savion Glover and--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --so, so for this one, now, I mean the, the material, the one reviewer said was an extraordinary political statement and someone else said, "There was nothing noise and funk cannot and should not do."  I think so, so many things are going on on stage.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 672915
Speaker 1: Were you nominated for any awards for this show?
Speaker 2: That was the first time I was actually nominated.  I was--Zane [Zane Mark], Ann [Ann Duquesnay] and myself were nominated for best musical score [Best Original Score], and it was a chance for me to take my mother [Bernardine Murden Taylor] with me to the Tony Awards [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] as her payoff for having made me stick at the piano when I was like eight years old, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we did not win, but it was, you know, always nice just to be invited to the party in terms of, you know, the Broadway community started accepting me as more than just, you know, an associate conductor at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was, you know, I mean it's, and again, it's like because it's the Tony's, you look around and you, you see a little bit more about how things operate, because, you know, there's a little political stuff going on in all those award shows, not just the Tony's, of course. But also just in terms of being proud of something, it probably is the thing that I'm, I'm, the most proud of because it introduced that, it introduced that Savion [HistoryMaker Savion Glover] style of tap to a whole new generation.  I mean you got people out there now that are doing what they do because they saw 'Noise Funk' ['Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk,' Reg E. Gaines], they saw what Savion was doing.  The other thing is that it was a, a, what am I saying.  It was a, it was just that, that time period because I had, I remember we were sitting around the table discussing with, with, with the people that were relatively young in the cast, about their thoughts about, about you know, politics, about race and everything and it was, it was the most negative, despairing conversation I'd heard because you saw these people, you were listening to all these people that didn't seem to have much hope for the future, and, you know, by the time George [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe] got finished sculpting this piece, and was able to show them where they'd been, where they're going and hopefully, you know, you know, just where they're going even further after that, it's like you could see that they had started changing their thinking towards things as well, so, you know, I was glad to see that happen and I hope that a lot of other people also saw that because, you know, 1996 was, you know, it was a horrible time, particularly in New York [New York], with you know, crack [crack cocaine], just of lots of crime still, so it's, you know, I'd like to think it got a little better after that but that was a really dark period.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think gun violence had escalated--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to a record level in most U.S. cities.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I know it hit a record in Chicago [Illinois], they're talking about how bad it is in Chicago as we speak now, but it still hasn't reached the level that it did in '94 [1994], '95 [1995], '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: Wow.  Wow.
Speaker 1: So around '97 [1997] it starts to decline, you know, a little bit, but, you know, but it's still there.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: You know we're still in a mode of, you know, extreme gun violence on the streets.
Story_ID: 672916
Speaker 1: Did the show ['Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk,' Reg E. Gaines]--was it used by educators at all, did they bring any of their students to--?
Speaker 2: It was, absolutely--
Speaker 1: Yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and Donna [Donna Walker-Kuhne], of course I'm not gonna remember her last name, but she was our person that put together this huge education packet for people to actually use in the school system and for when they actually came to the show.  I mean there was, there was a huge education component to this show.
Speaker 1: Was this, do you think this show was, was this the first show that you thought really had a lot of, well, the other shows undoubtedly did too, but this one was kind of specifically designed to educate, right?
Speaker 2: I think it was.  George's whole thing is he's trying to get a message across, educate, but most importantly, as any show on Broadway is, is to entertain, you know, so, and some of the ways he did it was, was, you know, kind of, you--you drop your jaw.  I mean there's this one scene where the, the guy is tap dancing on top of a bale of hay and he looks like he's having a good time and the woman's actually singing a blues song really happy, relatively happily about, about the names of states and the numbers that she's calling off are the number of people that were hung in that state, and then at the end of this number, you know, where you don't realize all that's going on, it's like the guy is, they used lights to actually hang him from a noose.  I mean it's like, you know, you're like sitting up here tapping your toes to this number and all of a sudden this guy is like tapping frantically as he's on his last gasp of breath.  It's, aw man, but that's what George [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe] does.  He's, you know, he'll set you up like that if you're not careful.
Story_ID: 672917
Speaker 1: Tell us something about George Wolfe [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe].
Speaker 2: George Wolfe is, you know, I can't use any words that other people haven't already used.  It's--brilliant, of course, is at the top of the list.  He's also extremely funny.  He's extremely, extremely insightful.  I mean he can, I don't, I don't know where he got it from but he can read a person like, you know, just from body language, he can read it, no doubt.  And from tone of voice.  He also throws the best parties on this planet.  He was my best man at my wedding and threw the best bachelor party, and just a very considerate person that is, that is, when it comes to, when it comes to dealing with actors, you couldn't ask for a better person.  He, he's extremely sensitive but he also knows how to get his point across and it's rare, it's like you're, you're talking about a director that not only understands the, the technical aspects, but also the human aspects of putting a play on.  And I'm not saying there aren't other directors that, that do, that can't do that, but, you know, George was very special in that way.  And particularly for me because of his focus on African American history.
Story_ID: 672918
Speaker 1: Now in '96 [1996] you founded DMW Enterprises [DMW Enterprises, Inc.], right?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time I was, it was time to just incorporate, so it's, it's the business name for all the other stuff I'd basically been doing, you know, as an independent contractor before then.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So this is something that, well speak to the business of it.  Somebody watching this may want to know what they ought to do when they reach this level.
Speaker 2: The, you know, the, the business side I, I have to say that people always, well I shouldn't say they always, but there are people that have asked me to speak at colleges and I say, "If you want me to do that, it's like I don't need to speak about the artistic side of what this means, I need to speak about the business side," because, you know, it's one thing to have your starry eyed dreams and, you know, think that, you know, you're gonna have this hit show and everything's gonna be hunky dory, but that is so not the reality for ninety-something percent of the people, and you've got to be, you have to know how to deal with that.  Until you get to that point, you have to figure out, you know, what are you gonna do to survive.  Particularly in a place like New York [New York], that's a very, very difficult question.  Not only that, but after you have that hit Broadway show, what are you gonna do?  It's like--everybody, especially if you're young, thinks that that's gonna last forever and that's the way it's always gonna be, and it's rarely that way.  So I always try and tell people that the business side, I mean there's, you know, there's the whole preparation artistically, making sure that you have, in case of a performer, having your head shots.  In the case of musicians, you know, if you--you need to get out there.  You need to just let everybody hear you.  You need to, you know, you need to send out resumes if you can.  And, but most important, it's, it's like, it's the contact with other people and, you know, it's not, it's not who, you know, a lot of people say it's who you know, it's--to me I have to reverse that and say who knows you.  That's more, that's much more important.  It's like it could be somebody that, you know, that you don't know at all but he heard you in a club and he's gonna be interested enough to like come and ask for your work someplace.  So there's that side of it, but there's also the financial side, which you cannot ignore, and, you know, I've been very fortunate to, you know, be able to pay my bills every month, but it's also because, you know, I know the reality.  It's like I came here late enough in life.  I didn't move to New York until I was twenty-five, so, you know, by that point I realized, you know, I need to figure out a plan that's gonna, you know, make me be able to stay here for longer than like six months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, in other words, I know you asked about the business side probably just, just the artistic side of the business, but, you know, it's the, it's business period in terms, you know, it's called in the case of the music business, it is called the music business for a reason.  You know it's, there's, there's so much, there is so much that has to happen professionally and financially.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I hope that makes sense.
Story_ID: 672919
Speaker 1: We didn't mention yet, I mean you joined the union, right, the--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah when you, almost as soon as you got to New York [New York]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well I had, actually I had joined the, I was in American Federation of Musicians going back to Cleveland, Ohio, but I had let my membership lapse there 'cause, you know, there wasn't that many union gigs, so I had to rejoin when I was here in New York, and, again, it's like they don't really, it's people outside the business think that the union gets you gigs, they don't.  But what they do and what they do relatively well, particularly for Broadway musicians is make sure that once you have a gig, that, you know, you get a really good paycheck and really good benefits.
Story_ID: 672920
Speaker 1: In '97 [1997], you're involved in 'Street Corner Symphony.'  That's a Marion Caffey [Marion J. Caffey] production, I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --creation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That one was just fun because it was all the music that I'd grown up with, you know.  All that '70s [1970s] stuff that, that, you know, like, geez, can I name any of the tunes now?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Like, well, "Best of my Love" [ph.], going back all the way to "I Wanna Know Your Name" by the Intruders.  It was all that stuff so it was just, it was a fun show to do.  Unfortunately, you know, the problem with those kind of shows is you gotta make sure that you have a really, a really strong integrated book and just got that part of it right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now is that, is that the toughest part to get?  I mean what's the hardest--it would seem like that might be the toughest part of a musical.
Speaker 2: I, I, I'd say that you're absolutely right.  It's, you know, the story is always the problem.  It's, you know, anybody could come up with songs (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like the songs flow.
Speaker 2: You know I think so.
Speaker 1: And choreography too.
Speaker 2: In, in, in general I, I think that most people would agree that the book is the hardest thing to get right.  They're the ones that normally get, you know, creamed the most in reviews.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  Oh well, so, so this is a good idea but it didn't, it didn't have the, and good art, but it didn't have the book.
Speaker 2: Right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --unfortunately.
Story_ID: 672921
Speaker 1: Now in 2000 you composed the music for 'In Real Life,' right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was just mostly incidental music, but it was a show with Charlayne Woodard who's just an amazing performer who I'm glad I had the chance to work with.  She's just, you know, a really bright spirit and she was in the process of, I think this was the second of three shows that she wrote for herself, primarily because she was tired of not getting work that she liked, so (laughter) so Daniel Sullivan [Daniel J. Sullivan] who is another just great director, I just, I loved watching him help her to sculpt this piece.  You know he, he gave me the assignments that he needed for the show and I just had a good time doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you, you won an AUDELCO Award [Audience Development Committee, Inc.] in 2002 for, for Best Music Director.  Was this for the music for 'Real Life,' or--?
Speaker 2: No, this was for another show that George [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe] was doing called 'Harlem Song.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And again, Zane [Zane Mark] and I actually did the compositions, did some original music for it and we used some music through the periods.  It was for the, it was actually for the Apollo Theater [New York, New York].  They, they were hoping that this was gonna be a production that they could just mount every year.  Unfortunately, this is right after 9/11 [September 11, 2001] so they never got the tourist crowds so that they wanted so it did not last as long as they, as they wanted it to.
Story_ID: 672922
Speaker 1: Two thousand two [sic. 2004] also was a show called 'Drowning Crow' and now you did all the music for this one too?
Speaker 2: This one--this was, but this was another play, so it was mostly, it was incidental music, except for one song at the end of act one, and again, just, you know, nice to have another new experience to add, and it was a play by Regina Taylor [Regina Taylor] that was just, you know, it, it's always fun to me.  I, as you probably have noticed by now, most of the stuff that I work on are original, are original pieces that I get to add, you know, my own take to, so it's, you know, I'm always happy for the, the chance to work on a new project like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is a play that's set in the present day of Gullah islands of South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So was there like a Gullah music that you, style of music that you had to come up with?
Speaker 2: No, not for this one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were going a little more, I should say not really esoteric, but we weren't as concerned with the, with the Gullah side of it as, you know--maybe, maybe we probably should have hit a little bit of that, but it was, it was more, more atmospheric kind of music, just more underscored for the most part and like I said one song was a hip hop song, so, and we were using, I forget what the, I forget which Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] piece, but we were actually using a piece of Shakespeare for it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is, yeah, well Chekhov [Anton Chekhov] it says here, but.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but we used, we actually used a piece of Shakespeare sonnet in the middle of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But yes, it was based on a Chekhov play and don't get me to lying about which one it is, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says here 'The Seagull,' but I didn't know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.  Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I don't know about it, you know, either, but that, so I was wondering yeah, if you used any Gullah, I mean they do those ring shouts and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly, right.
Speaker 1: --things with the stomps.
Story_ID: 672923
Speaker 1: In 2005, now, you arrange the music, the dance music for 'The Color Purple.'
Speaker 2: Right, this was the first version.  There's a, there's a new version that did not use, that used very little dance.  They completely redid the show, but for this one [HistoryMaker] Donald Byrd was the choreographer and LaChanze who won a Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] for this, was the star of the show.  Again, it was just another challenge, particularly Donald Byrd's style was, was one that I wasn't completely used to so it just took a second to what, to what he needed, but again, just, you know, a learning experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And one that was quite profitable considering that show actually ran for quite a while.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Earning--in 2005 to 2008 earning eleven Tony Award nominations.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no it was, they did quite well.  And, the other thing I have to say about that show is, it was at the Broadway Theatre [New York, New York] which is one of the bigger theaters on Broadway and it was amazing to see, you know, just African Americans lined up down the block to come into a Broadway theater night after night.  I mean it's no small feat to fill a Broadway theater like that, and, you know, people absolutely adored the show.

Speaker 1: Typical Broadway theater is what, how, how many people, a thousand at least, or--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: There, I would say the average house is probably between, between a thousand and twelve hundred.  You have some, I wanna say there's a theater as small as like seven or eight hundred.  I could be wrong.  And there's some that are certainly in the eighteen hundred seat categories I believe.  But, you know, ten thousand, (shakes head) one thousand to twelve hundred is probably about the average range.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  If you get any bigger than that it kind of loses some intimacy right, or--?
Speaker 2: It depends on the show.  Some shows are, are, are better, better seen in that kind of scale.  I mean, you know, before 'The Color Purple,' one of the shows that was in there was 'Miss Saigon.' I mean, you know, if you're looking at this huge helicopter coming down from the sky it doesn't hurt to have a theater that big.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  May not hurt to be back some too from it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well there's that, yes.
Story_ID: 672925
Speaker 1: That's interesting, yeah, I, yeah, I remember the multimillion dollar production of Spider-Man ['Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark']--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, exactly--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and that, you know, it never seemed to get off the ground--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --but it was like a huge, you know, with the, yeah, the--did you ever have to really consider yourself in the technical aspects of lighting and that sort of thing in a show when you're doing the music?  Do you think about that or do they kind of like follow what you've done basically for their--
Speaker 2: You know theater is like the, the, the epitome of collaboration in the arts.  And to answer your question, it's, it's, it's, there are times that I follow.  There are times that they follow.  There are times the director tells us, so (laughter).  But in general it's, in general it's the director that's making those kind of calls.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So he'll coordinate how--what best--
Speaker 2: Right, he's looking--it's his vision, so, you know, if you've got a light, especially, you know, on most shows these days because you can be so precise.  If you have a light that's hitting at a certain time, you know, the director is gonna absolutely demand that you have a piece of music happening at that same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now the question as to which comes first, I would, I think that, I think that a lot of times it's--I was gonna say I think a lot of times the music comes first, but that's not necessarily true.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I would just guess it would, but yeah, there are times--
Speaker 2: It depends when, in other words there are some lighting effects that don't happen until you get into the theater and the music has already been done and that's when you realize that, you know, you might want a sound with that particular effect that you wouldn't have known because you didn't have lights before.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Say if someone appears--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and there's a special on them all of a sudden--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, yep.
Speaker 1: --you know, music should reflect that kind of--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 672926
Speaker 1: Two thousand and five [2005] you were also involved in 'Miracle Brothers' which had a samba score, right?
Speaker 2: Brazilian score, yeah, that included some samba music and some other styles as well from Brazil.  It was just another time that it was, it was just fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a show that takes us back to the 17th century in Brazil.
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's a story about the 17th century but the music is basically, you know, modern day Brazilian.  You know it's one of those times when, you know, even in like 'The Color Purple' the movie, Quincy [HistoryMaker Quincy Jones] chose to use music that was more contemporary than the period, and, you know, it works, so it's the same thing that we were trying to do with that.  Or, you know, a more, a more recent example would be what, you know, the current Broadway show 'Hamilton' ['Hamilton: An American Musical,' Lin-Manuel Miranda] is doing, which they're using hip hop to describe seventeenth--you know 18th century people.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  Okay.  So now this is a show that I, I had never heard of it and did it have a very long run at all?
Speaker 2: Which, 'Miracle Brothers'?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, it didn't, it was, most of the shows, that was an off Broadway show so most of those off Broadway shows are, you know, relatively limited runs and that was at the Vineyard Theatre [New York, New York] so yeah, they, it's, you hope for an afterlife.  In other words, a lot of times, especially off Broadway, you'll put a show up with the hopes that, that somebody wants to do something with it afterwards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although having said that, something like Blue Man Group has been around for decades at this point.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now you incorporated a friction drum in this.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: A friction drum in this, right.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, absolutely, cuica, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has that sound--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that (makes sound) sound--
Speaker 2: How do you know about friction drums?
Speaker 1: I'm a, I'm a little--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --I know a little (laughter).  And a song about Palmares [Brazil]--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --the Republic of the Palms--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --created by Africans that escaped slavery.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So this is a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Kirsten Childs who I just got finished doing orchestrations for another one of her shows, she's, she's another one of those people that had like a really unique theatrical voice and just, I, I wanted to work with her on this- the show I worked with her on recently ['Bella: An American Tall Tale'] because of this 'Miracle Brothers.'  I just, I love, I love her musical voice.
Story_ID: 672927
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, 2006 there's an adaption of Aeschylus' 'Seven Against Thebes' called 'Seven' ['The Seven'] right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  The--I like to call that the first hip hop musical, long before 'Hamilton' ['Hamilton: An American Musical,' Lin-Manuel Miranda] but (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you could.  When I saw it I, you know, I saw this, or read about it, I never saw the show, but--
Speaker 2: It was, but it was, I mean it's, and they used the same idea.  It's like as 'Hamilton' is talking about 18th century people.  We're talking about ancient Greeks here, but using the hip hop vernacular, I mean, just makes it extremely fresh.  I mean it was, it was one of my favorite shows to work on just because it was so different.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the play, it said that--here that the original featured very little action, actors standing and talking, but in the musical play what--
Speaker 2: Oh no, we had lots of movement because [HistoryMaker] Bill T. Jones whose one of the premier choreographers, he was involved, so there was lots of action on this one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, we interviewed Bill T. Jones, all right.  So now this one also did not run long I take it, did not run--
Speaker 2: Again, it was, it was an off Broadway show, so it's, it didn't run long in New York [New York] but it had a few other productions.  And again, its, you know, the thing is that pieces are sometimes you just don't get the kind of reviews that, that you want, but you--that doesn't mean you're not happy with the work.  I was extremely proud of the work on this show.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm glad you said that because people do have a tendency to think that if it didn't make Broadway, it's not worth doing and it's a lot of good theater that never makes Broadway.
Speaker 2: There's lots.  I mean I'm working right now with [HistoryMaker] Lynn Nottage who just go a Pulitzer Prize [Pulitzer Prize for Drama], a few years ago at this point, but she's just now getting her first Broadway show up this spring so (laughter), but she's been making a living, you know, before that.  There is more to theater than just Broadway, absolutely.
Story_ID: 672928
Speaker 1: Another show--I mean a play, you did a, composed the music for 'Blue-' for 'Blue Door' by--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Delroy Lindo who is the actor who has been in plays and on the screen.
Speaker 2: I didn't know he did it.  That's actually, it's written by Tanya Barfield--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --and the version that I did, I believe Reg E. Cathey was the, was the main lead with Andre [Andre Holland], man I'm gonna get his name wrong so let me shut up.
Speaker 1: Braugher [Andre Braugher], or--?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: No, not Braugher.
Speaker 2: It's a, he's a young guy, really talented actor, but the bottom line is after off Broadway, it did go to a couple other theaters so Delroy might have done it at one of those theaters.
Speaker 1: Yeah Delroy directed, it said, at some point, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 672929
Speaker 1: Now 'Memphis' by David Bryan, was one where, now you won some Tony Awards [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] for this one did, did you not?
Speaker 2: That was, that was the one I won a Tony for.  Yeah, I did the orchestrations with David and it was, again, I've been very lucky to be able to work on stuff that I like.  This was like R and B from the, from the '60s [1960s] mostly, but, you know I cheated and did a little bit of the '70s [1970s] stuff in there as well.  But it was just, it was just a lot of fun and this one had a, a story that was, that resonates with me in terms of the whole, you know, black and white thing, particularly with, you know, when you're talking about breaking down those racial barriers back in the '60s [1960s] and the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay. It was a story about a interracial romance, right?
Speaker 2: Correct, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a white deejay and black performer--
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --female performer, taking place here in the days when the Memphis [Tennessee] sound was in it's--
Speaker 2: It was still, I mean we were still talking about race records back then, you know, I mean supposedly white people were not supposed to be listening to black records and we all know what happened with that so.
Speaker 1: It was based loosely on the story of a white disc jockey [Dewey Phillips] and --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Of a real, exactly, right, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, wow.  So this is not, so you take your mother [Bernardine Murden Taylor] to this Tony Award, or did you--
Speaker 2: No, I took, no--
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't?  Okay.
Speaker 2: --this one I took my niece to actually--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because actually my niece was starting her senior year in college as an actress so I was like hopefully this would be motivation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you mother see you win, I mean, she was--?
Speaker 2: My mother saw me when this went on television.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the first one she was actually on TV so then she was excited about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what, did you have a favorite song from this?
Speaker 2: I did actually.  It's a song called "Memphis Lives in Me."  It's a ballad but it's just, it's one of the most soulful ballads I think David has, has written, or one of the most soulful songs period that he's written.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right and--
Speaker 2: And, you know, David is, you know, the keyboard player for Bon Jovi, it's, you know, it's like who would think this would be coming out of him, but it's, you know, he did a really great job with this music.
Story_ID: 672930
Speaker 1: So you won a Drama Desk Award too, right this (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  It was a good year.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's 2010.  So when you, when you win, well, you were, you've been nom- you had been nominated a number of times--?
Speaker 2: Right.  And the thing is that, especially because, you know, if you're, if you're twenty-two, twenty-three years old and you win a Tony Award [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre], it's like, you know, doors kind of open up or at least people wanna see you come through 'em and, you know, see what you got for 'em.  For me, most people already knew who I was, so it's not a matter, it's, people think, you know, people want to congratulate me, but the jobs that are gonna come to me are the jobs that are gonna come to me whether I win a Tony or not, just because people already know, you know, what you do.  And, hopefully, you know, hopefully, that will actually, hopefully that will continue through my life, but part of it also is making sure that you, that you, that--what am I saying here--that you manage to, to just keep doing the work, period.
Story_ID: 672931
Speaker 1: Now the next project, now you conducted the music for 'After Midnight,' right, and there's a show about the Cotton Club [New York, New York] and the Harlem Renaissance?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah.  And that one was a lot of fun to do because it was, I got a chance to work with Wynton Marsalis on that one.  I mean he, this started off as a piece called the 'Cotton Club' [sic. 'Cotton Club Parade'] and eventually went to Broadway as a show called 'After Midnight.'  And I was brought into it by Jack Viertel who conceived the idea because he wanted somebody that could be a liaison between the theater world and the jazz world, and, you know, luckily Mar- Wynton had seen me maybe a couple of years ago with Eartha [HistoryMaker Eartha Kitt].  I had done a benefit with, for him, I think it was Ed Bradley's I don't know, something with Ed Bradley, I don't think it was his memorial, but Wynton had remembered me from there because I had to conduct Wynton's orchestra cause they didn't, he didn't really have a conductor and so when he saw me he was like, "Okay you cool, you can, we'll work together."  And, you know, mutual respect, and, you know, I learned so much from that, so much from doing that show.
Speaker 1: Had you ever been involved with this many Duke Ellington songs?
Speaker 2: Not Duke Ellington songs, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you know, that's Wynton's thing, he's like, he's pushing those songs so this is, this, it was a lot in this show.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And now--
Speaker 2: But now having said that, I actually did sit in Duke's chair for one show.  I was, Mercer Ellington was doing the orchestra.  It was a society date while we were doing 'Queenie Pie' back in the '80s [1980s], and so he asked me to play, you know, the piano that Duke would play.  And he counted off the first tune and he goes (makes sound) and I'm just waiting, and then like, you know, four bars later I hear the band come in with (scats) ["Take the A Train"] and that would be how I missed the absolute most famous piano in the world to start a song.  (Scats).
Speaker 1: That's the one, (scats).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he never called it again that night, so, anyway, moving along, sorry (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a, you know, that's a moment we--I don't know if you want to.  We cut one out (laughter), make you look good.  But, yeah, that's--yeah that is a famous, (scats).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 672932
Speaker 1: Twenty fourteen [2014] here's a Tupac [Tupac Shakur] musical, an inspired musical--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Holler If Ya Hear Me' [Todd Kreidler and Tupac Shakur].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Again, it was just a joy to work with these people.  And it's another case where it was just, we could never get the story right.  And it's a shame because the music, once people got into the theater, once they got past the fact that it was hip hop and got into the music it's, they actually realized how much Tupac had to say number one.  Number two, how musical it really is.  And even though we were using Tupac's stuff, there were, there are musical theater trappings to that because there's built-in drama to the songs, you know, so it was just a matter of how do you, how do you eke them out enough to, you know, enhance them enough to, to appeal to a little bit more mainstream audience without diluting what it really is.  And I think we did a good job with that, but, again, the story is, is, gets to be a problem sometimes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--yeah--
Speaker 2: Now, and having said that, I think that if we could have ran a little bit, we would have found an audience, I think we were just, we were in the wrong theater at not the right time.  We opened in the summer and if--I think we should have opened a little bit later, but sometimes you have to take what you can get.
Speaker 1: I wonder sometimes if there's not gold to be mined by some producers in shows that didn't make it big.
Speaker 2: Yep, you are absolutely right.
Speaker 1: To return to those shows--
Speaker 2: And that, that has happened several times, I mean even Stephen Sondheim didn't, didn't really do well with, what's the show, 'Sweeney Todd' ['Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,' Hugh Wheeler and Stephen Sondheim], the first time.  Whatchamacallit, Kander [John Kander] and Ebb's [Fred Ebb], the show 'Chicago' which is running forever now, actually did not do that well when it first opened.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's interesting.
Speaker 2: So yeah, you're right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It depends on, it's timing and, I guess, the public mood at the time--
Speaker 2: Right.  And sometimes shows are just ahead of their time, they just are.
Story_ID: 672933
Speaker 1: So, in 2016 you conducted--you arranged, conducted, and supervised 'Shuffle Along.'
Speaker 2: I did not conduct it, that was Shelton Becton, but I did, I did compose some music for it and arranged and supervised and orchestrated, yes.
Speaker 1: Now this is, it's called 'Shuffle Along, or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed.'
Speaker 2: I'm glad you reading that because I never could have said all that, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and, but this isn't the original.  I mean when I first saw it I thought now this is 'Shuffle Along' and, you know with, I guess, was it Eubie Blake and--?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yep.  The original show was called 'Shuffle Along,' 1921, but George, again this is another George Wolfe [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe] production.  He wanted to show a lot of the behind the scenes work with how the show actually got up in the first place, and the aftermath of having a show up on Broadway, a successful black Broadway show.  So that's how we ended up with what we ended up with.  It's, very little of this show actually shows much of the, of the original material because, honestly, the original material just would not hold up today.  It's, you know, some stuff is questionable because of, you know, dialect or, you know, some of the skits just really weren't funny.  So what he did was try and pull enough to, to actually show people some of the, the original, but the story that was much more interesting was seeing what happened to all those people that put the show up.  And, again, it's just a show I'm really proud of.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a few years ago I found some music for Will Marion Cook and Paul Laurence Dunbar's 'Origin of the Cakewalk'--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --'Clorindy, or the Origin of a Cake Walk,' right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I said I'm a Dunbar, I live in Dayton [Ohio], in Dunbar's home, and I'm thinking, but it just doesn't seem to thrill anybody today, the music just doesn't, it's for that time period and it's hard to make it--
Speaker 2: And that was, that was one of the challenges for me was the music from that time.  I mean it's a hundred years old.  People have done it a million different ways since then.  What, what can I do to bring something to it to make it seem at least halfway fresh.  And George made my job easier by pulling a lot of the, as far as I'm concerned, pulling a lot of the focus off of the music and putting it on the drama so that when I, when I did actually have to do the music, I could, I, I think that I did do stuff that was different and, you know, made it feel fresher than a hundred years ago.  But there was also the fact that Savion [HistoryMaker Savion Glover] did, this is another show Savion was involved with, that he did tap dance that a lot of times it had nothing to do with 1920.  He was sitting in the bebop era, he was sitting in the '40s [1940s], he was sitting like, you know, in hip hop area even sometimes, but because I could give him a bed of stuff that was grounded in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], then he could work on top of that to get what he needs, and so all of those were challenges that, you know, I was very happy with.
Story_ID: 672934
Speaker 1: Now are you working on a show now?
Speaker 2: At the beginning stages of three different shows.  They are, it's, you know it's, again it, sometimes it takes anywhere from like two to three years to seven years to get these shows up.  One I'm working with George Wolfe [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe].  Another one I'm working on with the guys that put up, well with Rick Elice who put up 'Jersey Boys' that's been running forever, so, and it's, I have really, I just (gestures) keep my fingers crossed that one works.  And I'm also working on another show with Alicia Keys, so hopefully, we'll get that one up, at least at the first stage, but I don't think any of these are going to Broadway first.  I think, you know, the new model is to take stuff around the country, make sure it works and then bring it in and, you know, hopefully, at least one of these will come in sometime soon.
Story_ID: 672935
Speaker 1: Do you have a--favorite performers that you worked with over the years?
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Or who are some of them?  So I'm not going--I'm trying to phrase it so I don't get you in trouble with anybody, but.
Speaker 2: I don't know if anybody's asked me that question.  One of my, my, I have to say my, the absolute most favorite gig that I ever did of all time was with Patti Austin.  She is just an amazing musician and entertainer.  And a friend of mine, Shelton Becton, he, he was also Roberta Flack's music director at the time and he couldn't do a job with her, with Patti, in Kansas City [Missouri], so he asked me if I would fill in as her music director.  And it was with the Kansas City orchestra [Kansas City Symphony].  So, I get there, you know, you--generally you only have like two and a half hours rehearsal with the, with the orchestra beforehand, and then you hit the gate that night.  We did the rehearsal.  We only did eight songs.  That's all she had charts for.  And I'm like, you know, if this is an Eartha [HistoryMaker Eartha Kitt] gig that might be only twenty-five, thirty minutes worth of material, how's she gonna stretch this into an hour, which is what she was supposed to do.  And after six songs we were at the half hour mark, and I'm like, now what she's gonna do, and she managed to, like joke with the audience, the interplay.  She came up with like this whole other tune just we just kind of followed along, and before you know it, not only have we done the hour but, you know, we still had, we were getting ready to encores that were past an hour.  And the last moment of that show, the last song, it was just her and me, it was just piano and voice, and it was just like, "Man, this is like my, I don't know if my life will ever get any better than this moment right here."
Speaker 1: Patti Austin is, she's, she never, I don't think she's ever been big as she could have been.
Speaker 2: I don't know what that's about.  All I know is she is just one hell of a musician and person.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Now, of course, Eartha, I can't, you know, I can't leave her out.  I used to work with Leslie Uggams.  I had a great time working with Leslie.  I had done one gig with Cab Calloway.  It was interesting just working with Cab.  I did a chart for Sammy Davis Jr.  I didn't meet him until after I had done the chart, but, again, just interesting, like meeting these people.  I'd, I'd worked with Mel Carter for a second, Jennifer Holliday.  I mean, you know, I kind of been around a little bit.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and those are all really spectacular talents--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And, and that's, so, I mean you can kind of see from some, from the people I worked with, it's like I don't really, you know, I don't really do like the contemporary thing, but I work with what I consider to be, you know, classic, classic kind of, not classy because everybody, I wanna say everybody's classy, but classic kind of performers, like old school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of timeless stuff, in other words--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah.  And, you know, to see somebody like Cab Calloway, when I was working with him it as, it was not too, I don't think he lived much longer after I worked with him, but he, you know, to see him like basically take really small steps to get to the stage, explode on that stage and give the energy he gives for like forty-five minutes to an hour and then come off and he's like taking those baby steps again.  And watching people like Eartha and even Sammy Davis do the same thing.  It's like you learn, you see.  Part of that is, of course, what keeps them alive, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think, yeah, yeah.  You see artists rally like that sometimes, and you just don't know what to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just they, they're feeding off that audience.
Speaker 1: Right, it's almost like a faith healer (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Hitting somebody with their hands, you know, when they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 672936
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  And I, I say that because, you know, I, I'm one of those people that believes that I'm where I'm supposed to be and you do something different and it seems like it's gonna, you go back to try and correct something you did before and you never know what, what's gonna happen if you go down that new road that looks like it's great, but there, you know, you just don't know.  I should--I'm happy I'm at this point in my life in one piece.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know people always tell me that when you're prepared and you meet the opportunity that's when you have success.
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I think, you know, I, I think I could have had a, a certainly, a larger career.  Would I be a better person, would I be a happier person, I don't, I'm not so sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So if you'd have studied physics harder or something in school (laughter).
Speaker 2: Or if I'd studied, if I had gone to Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York] or if I gone to Berklee [Berklee College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts], it's like I'd be a better musician, I don't think I'd be a better person necessarily.  It's like I, you know, going to, even though Livingstone [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina] was a, a great music school, I learned a lot about how to, how to interact with people down there.  And I think a lot of people like working with me, sometimes not because I'm the best musician, but because they know I'll treat them right.
Story_ID: 672937
Speaker 1: I should ask you this.  Now what, what is, your first Broadway musical was 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope'--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Micki Grant, right?
Speaker 2: Right, Micki Grant, yep--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Micki Grant.  And that was the first, I think one of the first black Broadway shows in a long long time.  Not like we hadn't had some before, but it was like a groundbreaking kind of show.
Speaker 2: Right and I--let me interject here, I mean one of the other things I wanted to say about Noise Funk ['Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk,' Reg E. Gaines] is that was part of what I was proud of is that we were, we were the first Broadway show to have been nominated for best musical score [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre, Best Original Score] since 'The Wiz,' and that would have been like twenty something years before.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Really.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  I mean it's, people think of 'Dreamgirls' as a black show, but it was not written by blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Anyway, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's a good point, that's a good point.  So, I know Micki Grant's show was written by her and, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly, yep, exactly.
Speaker 1: --and everything.  That was a black production, I mean it wasn't a black production, but she created the--
Speaker 2: No, it was a black production.
Speaker 1: Oh was it?  Okay.
Speaker 2: It was.  Yeah, that was Vinnette Carroll I believe was the producer [sic. director].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, all right.  So this is a--
Speaker 2: Who, you know, tough as nails broad who managed to make her way on Broadway.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, there's a, now when you received the AUDELCO award [Audience Development Committee, Inc.] I think about the support for black artists, you know, from arts too.  AUDELCO was, and there were other groups that were formed over the years, there was--Black Theater Alliance, there were other--other groups that, you know, tried to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --surround the black artists with--and offer opportunities and support.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's, I mean I, I was happy to get in on AUDELCO because I'm, I'm normally not even in a production that they look at.  It's because, you know, I'm usually working on Broadway work.  I don't think they even really look at those shows.  But, so it was nice to be recognized by, you know, by an organization that I absolutely admire and respect.  And I wish I could figure out some other way to support them even just because, you know, the work they--the work that they do is extremely valuable to helping people get to the next level.

Speaker 1: Today do you think our position or--on Broadway, as, you know, in terms of Broadway shows anyways, has, has increased or, where--where do you think black folks are now?
Speaker 2: You know, it's, it's all over the place to me.  It's--you know you have shows that are employing lots of you know, African Americans and other minorities, something like, you know, right now currently you've got 'Book of Mormon' ['The Book of Mormon'], 'Hamilton' ['Hamilton: An American Musical,' Lin-Manuel Miranda], 'The Color Purple,' and, you know, 'Lion King' ['The Lion King'].  But in terms of, I think more importantly, is trying to figure out how to get people on the production side that can actually help to promote plays about us.  Right now currently Stephen Byrd [Stephen C. Byrd] is the only black producer on Broadway.  It, it, why is he the only black producer in the year 2016, you know.  He's the one, he's got 'Color Purple' there.  But it's, there needs to be more.  So it's, it's the behind the scenes thing and that's the other reason I, you know, that, if people ask me to talk or to be on panels, even though I hate doing panels, I feel obligated to do them because if I don't do them, there might not be anybody else of color to represent.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That's a--yeah.  I think it's important--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, as a, I am a behind the scenes person with three Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] nominations.  It's like that's, that's kind of unusual.  There needs to be more.  There's people like Paul Tazewell who does costumes who did a million but--who's had a million nominations, but in terms of orchestrations, I am the only, I've had two, and, you know, for me to have the most nominations is kind of, you know, disturbing to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now having said that, if I get another one and get a win, I might be less disturbed.
Story_ID: 672939
Speaker 1: Now is, is Broadway still the kind of place, we were talking about this before we started the interview, still a place where somebody could grow up in the Midwest and come to New York [New York] and go to an audition or, you know, show up and make it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it absolutely is.  You know you're always looking for fresh, you know, good talent, always.  But, what I keep telling people is that, you know, talent is a given, particularly in this city, particularly in New York.  It's like what else do you have, you know, it's--do you have the right attitude.  And sometimes its things that are beyond your control.  If you're too short, you know, you know you're not going to be a Rockette.  You know, if you are a little too plump, unfortunately for most shows, you're not going to be in the dance ensemble.  So, you know, it's, it's not always, it's not always about you.  Sometimes it's about forces you have no control over and you just have to like let it go and move on to the next thing, and God knows in this city there's always a next thing.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I think that, my biggest hope is that we find a way to, to educate, particularly young black men, but in particular--but also, of course, young women, and find a way to keep them out of prison.  You know that whole school to prison system is, it's really disturbing.  And I don't, I don't know what the answer is.  I don't, I don't, I don't know if anybody has come up with a solution yet that, that can, you know, that can permeate the whole country.  It's like is it a, is it something that has to happen, you know, on the micro level, is it a, you know, I don't know, but that is, my hope is that we can at least start from the education point of it and if we can get people out of high school, you know, let's deal with the next step, but, at least get them out of high school.  My concern is no matter how educated you are that there is, that there is--that the issue, you know, of, of bias, racism, whatever you want to call it, is still going to follow you around and I don't know how we're going to deal with that, but, you know, we had that period where we thought, you know, when we elected a black man by the name of Saddam Hussein Obama that, I'm sorry (laughter), Barack Hussein Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama]--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It's a good thing his name wasn't--wasn't that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I know if it was Saddam we probably, all bets off, but anyway, BHO, we thought that, you know, like all of a sudden we're, you know, or at least we made a major step in this, I shouldn't say all of a sudden, but we have made a major step in the right direction, and, you know, unfortunately, here we are eight years later and that's where, we're going backwards in time and, you know, in attitudes.
Speaker 1: So with that--as we sit here, Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump] is president elect, right, of the United States.
Speaker 2: I was trying not to have that name come out in this conversation, but yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So it is some--some cause for a lot of concern.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, yeah, exactly.  So that's, that's where I am.
Story_ID: 672941
Speaker 1: What do you consider your, your major contribution, your legacy, at this point?
Speaker 2: I would like to think that it is--that the work that I have done will--will stand up to the people that come before me.  I mean I'm not doing anything, I hope, I'm not doing anything different than a bunch of people that have come before me like, you know, like the Danny Holgates, the Duke Ellingtons, the [HistoryMaker] Harold Wheeler, Luther Henderson, I just hope that my work compares favorably with theirs and like I have done with those peoples' work, somebody's, somebody will be inspired to build on what I've done.  That--that's about where I am right now.
Story_ID: 672942
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your family.  Do you--do you have children?
Speaker 2: I don't have children.  Unfortunately, my wife [Tracey Waters] and I divorced after only a couple of years, but we're still really good friends.  We still talk all the time.  I would have loved to have had a family but, you know, it's, I also have a really good community.  Between my own sisters, brothers and a bunch of friends.  You know, as you probably aware in this business a lot of people, you know, don't have much family, you know, especially because you wait 'til later to try and have kids in the first place, so we all kind of band together and, you know, it just, it's worked out, I'm happy.
Story_ID: 672943
Speaker 1: Is there anything we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, did I, I think we're okay.  Okay, I am scared of this last question though (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's not that bad, it's like legacy, a little bit different though.  But, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as, as a nice guy with hopefully at least a little bit of talent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's, that's pretty good.  Thank you very much for sharing with us--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Thank you.
