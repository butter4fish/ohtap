 Finchum Today is January 27, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum. Along with me is  Dr. Charles Abramson, and we   re in Gunderson Hall here on the OSU  campus. We are here to talk with Dr. Perry Gethner, and this is part of our  subseries focused on Phi Beta Kappa. Before we get to that, let   s begin with  having you tell us when and where you were born.  Gethner I was born in Chicago in 1947.  Finchum And what did your parents do for a living?  Gethner My father was a pharmacist. My mother was a homemaker.  Finchum Have brothers and sisters?  Gethner None living.  Finchum But growing up?  Gethner One sister.  Finchum And where did you graduate from high school?  Gethner Von Steuben in Chicago.  Finchum And what year?  Gethner That would have been    65.  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject?  Gethner I really enjoyed foreign languages, so I took a lot of French and German.  Finchum How did you become interested in that?  Gethner I   m not really sure, but I started taking courses and found that I was good at  them and I enjoyed them.  Finchum Had your parents spoken a different language?  Gethner No.  Finchum Grandparents?  Gethner They did, but not around me. (Laughs) Yeah, turns out it was something I  was good at, and then when I got to reading some of the literary works in  both of those languages I was hooked.  Finchum Did you participate in activities outside of school?  Gethner In high school? Yes, mostly musical.  Finchum And when you were in high school were you anticipating going to college or  did it just happen?  Gethner I wasn   t thinking too hard about it, but I guess it was understood.  Finchum Not the first one in your family to go, because your father had.  Gethner My father had gone, yes.  Finchum Were they from Chicago?  Gethner No, he was born in Russia. My mother was born in Chicago. In fact, both  sides of the family had come from Russia.  Finchum Did you have to work during high school, or did you choose to work during  high school?  Gethner Not during much. I worked part-time for my father.  Finchum Did not choose to go into pharmacy?  Gethner No, nor did he encourage me to do so.  Finchum Interesting. So once you finished high school, take us through your  educational path.  Gethner Yeah, went to a small liberal arts college in Minnesota called Carleton. It  was a very positive experience. The right kind of atmosphere for me,  marvelous professors. The French professor I had my freshman year, who  was also the head of the foreign languages department, was just sensational,  so he became my undergraduate mentor.  Finchum How had you chosen to go to Minnesota?  Gethner At the recommendation of a high school guidance counselor, because I  really didn   t have a clear sense of where I wanted to go.  Finchum Did your parents take you and drop you off?  Gethner Yes.  Finchum Just drop you and leave?  Gethner Yes.  Finchum How often would you go home?  Gethner Just at school vacations.  Finchum Distance-wise about how far?  Gethner It   s a very long trip. I   ve never actually driven it. I   ll probably go to my  fiftieth reunion and we   ll see how long it takes to drive there from here. It   s  not right nearby.  Finchum Well from Chicago to there     Gethner It   s shortly outside the Twin Cities.  Finchum Okay, and what year did you graduate from there?  Gethner Sixty-nine.  Finchum Were you involved with activities there?  Gethner Yeah, quite a number of activities.  Finchum Such as?  Gethner I was involved with a lot of the language clubs. In fact, I actually  participated in foreign language plays. I was in two French plays and one  German play, among other things.  Finchum You were inducted into Phi Beta Kappa there?  Gethner Yes I was.  Finchum How did you become aware that that was a possibility?  Gethner Actually I didn   t until I got the notice in campus mail. So it   s   in that  respect it   s similar to what we do here. It   s a secret process and the students  don   t apply. The faculty committee goes through transcripts and selects  them.  Finchum And your reaction?  Gethner I was delighted, as was my family.  Finchum Did you know what it was?  Gethner Yes. In those days everybody knew what it was.  Finchum Okay. So after that where did you go for your masters and your doctorate?  Gethner I went to Yale. However, I did not go there directly. I spent a year in France  first, since I had not done study abroad. I was able to get a position as a  lecturer teaching conversational English in a French high school. In those  days the program was administered through the Fulbright Organization.  Today, it   s organized by some other organization. I forget the name of it.  You weren   t actually taking classes there, although you could audit them. It  was simply an enrichment exercise, so it was a very exciting year. After that  I was drafted into the Army, Vietnam was going on. So that took up the next  two years of my life, and then I belatedly got to graduate school, so that was  in    72.  Finchum That you entered?  Gethner Yes. It was a joint masters-doctorate program. I finished in    77.  Finchum Do you want to talk a little about the Vietnam experience or not?  Gethner Not terribly, except that ultimately I did not get over to Vietnam, because  Congress slashed the military budget as a protest against the president.  People who were first-time draftees got out a few months early. So anybody  who had been slated to go to Vietnam in that particular contingent didn   t go.  Finchum A little bit of luck there.  Gethner Yes. I did however, qualify for the GI Bill.  Finchum We should back up and ask how did you finance your undergrad?  Gethner My father took out loans.  Finchum And then the GI Bill     Gethner Yeah, that completely took care of my graduate tuition.  Finchum Were you married anytime in-between those times?  Gethner No, I was not.  Finchum Just checking.  Gethner Yeah, I   ve never been married.  Finchum How did you choose Yale?  Gethner Actually, it was recommended by my undergraduate mentor because for  many, many decades it had been ranked as the number one French  department in the country. I got in there and they accepted me. I said,    I  guess it   s the place to be.     Finchum Do you want to mention the name of your mentor?  Gethner Yeah, his name was Donald Schier. He   s since passed away, but we did stay  in touch after graduation.  Finchum He had a major role in how you got here, I suppose, too?  Gethner Yes, he was a major influence in my career.  Finchum So you graduated from Yale when?  Gethner In    77, but did not get a job. The job market was terrible, so even people  with doctorates from Yale sometimes didn   t get hired. So I stuck around for  another year, had a part-time job at a local college, though that lasted only  one semester, simply because they didn   t have a whole lot of openings. I  was able to do some part-time teaching at Yale, but it was a rather difficult  year and I was continuing with additional research projects at the time.  Finchum Were you acting some during that time period?  Gethner At that point I had actually become active with the New Haven Opera  Theater. I was singing in their chorus. Did some productions there.  Finchum So a little bit of income.  Gethner No, that was not paid.  Finchum You benefited in other ways.  Gethner I did do a bit of singing professionally.  Finchum Had your parents   were they musical?  Gethner Not very much. My mother a little bit.  Finchum Do you play an instrument?  Gethner Yes, I play the piano and do some periodic performing. In fact, just this past  April I did a lecture/recital at the Library.  Finchum I missed it. And then when did you come here?  Gethner In    84.  Finchum So a few years there.  Gethner My first job was at the University of Chicago. I had a tenure track job there.  To the surprise of everybody in my own department, as well as me, I did not  get tenure, because the department had recommended me. At any rate, I had  to look around for other jobs, this one came along and I took it. So I arrived  here in 1984, which I like to refer to as the year of George Orwell.  (Laughter)  Finchum So over thirty years here.  Gethner Yes.  Finchum Had you interviewed at other places?  Gethner There were several other interviews.  Finchum And you chose this one for any particular reason?  Gethner Yes, there were two schools and this one I thought was slightly stronger than  the other, which was somewhat comparable.  Finchum Today, do you consider Stillwater home?  Gethner Yes, I do, it   s been, as you say, over thirty years. Virtually half my life.  Finchum If you came in    84, they had already started the Phi Beta Kappa application  process before you got here.  Gethner There had been two application processes before, though I wouldn   t know  that until later. And as typically happens, once you   re inducted into Phi Beta  Kappa, you know you   ve got the lifetime membership, but typically you  don   t do much with it. When I was at Chicago nobody ever reached out to  faculty, in fact that   s something we need to get back to doing here, when  they arrive, to tell them they   re automatically members of the new chapter.  So I had no contact during those years. So the absence of a Phi Beta Kappa  chapter here didn   t bother me. That changed a couple years after I got here  when, as you already know, Dean Stringer, who was chair of the Board of  Regents, happened to have a conversation with one of his law partners, in  which Phi Beta Kappa came up. The feeling was we really needed to apply.  At any rate, I was tapped by the then dean to head the committee, because  according to Phi Beta Kappa regulations, the administration technically is  not the initiator of the request to get a chapter. The request officially is  supposed to come from the faculty and staff of the institution who are  themselves already Phi Beta Kappa members. Nobody in that administration  was a member. They had to go through people   s CVs to see who   s a likely  person to head this committee. So that   s where it all started.  Finchum And were you tenured at that time?  Gethner I think I   yeah, I actually came up for early tenure. I think I would   ve just  got tenure at this time.  Finchum I understand it   s a long process and a lot of work, so about the same time  you were trying to get tenure it would   ve been challenging?  Gethner When I came here it was put in my contract that since I   d already had six  years in another school as an assistant professor and had an extensive  scholarly and teaching record, that would count toward tenure here.  Finchum When you say you got    tapped,    did you have the option of saying no?  Gethner Yes, but I said,    This is something that   s really worth doing.    I had no clue  how much work would be involved, but I said yes. At any rate, we went  through the files, and we discovered there   d been two previous applications.  I started interviewing some of the people who had been involved in the  previous applications, not all this happened right away, to get a sense of  what went wrong before. I don   t know how much of this you want me to go  into.  Finchum As much as you want. What did go wrong before?  Gethner In the    70s   and I haven   t found any paperwork on this, I   ve just heard  anecdotal stories from people around at the time. The first application, Phi  Beta Kappa seems to have been looser then than they have become since. At  least that   s the impression I get. So the application was not as complicated  or as long. We got to stage three, which is to say the on-site visit. Something  that would not happen again until, well, in my time until 2010. Everything  went well. The people who came, tapped from the national organization,  said that we were doing a respectable job. Consequently, things looked  good, but it turns out that at that point we were under censure from the  AAUP. There had a been a case of a controversial speaker being disinvited,  which led to all kinds of investigations. The feeling was that we were not  supporting academic freedom. At that point, censure from the AAUP  automatically blackballed the school. The visitors said,    Get off censure and  apply again.    Eventually we did. It helped that the then president agreed to  step down. That was all resolved.  We applied again in the early 1980s. Bob Spurrier, who had helped me  along the way with the later application processes, was in charge of things.  Once again we got to stage three, so we had the on-site visit. This one did  not go well at all. The people who came to OSU were very snobbish.  Apparently when they were going along Highway 51, at that point you had  the swine barn right on the main road. That caused snickering. People were  very, very unsympathetic. Somewhere in my files I have a copy of the report  they wrote on OSU. It was scathing. Parts of it, I think, were unfair. Part of  it I think was justifiable criticism. They felt the faculty workload wasn   t  good, that the Library was seriously deficient. There were lots and lots of  things about the school, the administration of the school, that they were not  satisfied with. It wasn   t a terribly helpful report. I mean they didn   t give us  any suggestions about what we could do better; just a long, long series of  negatives. They did say in general the quality of the faculty was good. So  everybody got discouraged. That is where things stood when I got involved  around 1987.  So we had our first effort, a committee was struck, and I had not realized  how long the applications were, how complicated they were, how intrusive  the questions were. The amount of, my opinion, a lot of unnecessary data.  We got everything submitted in time. What we ended up with was a form  letter addressed to me that basically said not just no, but that    Phi Beta  Kappa receives more applications than it   s able to accept, so they have to  focus on the schools whose values and ideals are most closely aligned with  those of the association,    which I considered quite a slap in the face.  Again, there was no talk about how we can improve, what they thought was  wrong with us, so we were turned down at stage one. The then dean, this by  the way was not the dean who picked me to begin with, blamed me  personally for the failure of the attempt. However, a lot of other people  thought that the dean should bear a share of the responsibility. The campus  had   let   s say we had not applied at a very happy time for OSU. The  campus was engaged in all kinds of turmoil. There were athletic scandals,  which didn   t put us in a good light. Some of these got national attention.  There was another national black eye when one of our former athletic stars  went on national TV to say, basically, he was illiterate after spending four  years at OSU. Then we had a freedom of speech issue in which the regents  tried to block the showing of a controversial film on campus. All these  things got national headlines.  There was even a big meeting at which the faculty expressed no confidence  in the president of OSU. I   ll never forget it. It was the most exciting meeting  I   ve ever been to here. It was in the middle of all of that turmoil that we  submitted the application. I should also point out there was a lot of faculty  who were disgruntled, particularly the dean of Arts and Sciences, and the  way OSU was going especially, because we had been going through a whole  bunch of not just these other crises, but also a budget crisis. There was a  major downturn in funding in the mid-80s.  So a lot of very unhappy faculty. I even found out that a number of people,  from various departments, wrote letters to the Phi Beta Kappa headquarters  saying,    OSU is terrible and doesn   t deserve a chapter.    Interestingly, I later  found out that in the previous application process there had also been people  who had indicated to Phi Beta Kappa that they thought we didn   t deserve a  chapter. I think I will not name names for this interview. (Laughs)  Finchum Were they members themselves?  Gethner Yes. They had a personal stake in this. In any case, everybody was so  discouraged that the whole effort was buried for a dozen years. Then some  good things started to happen. We had a new president, Jim Halligan, I think  we deserve to name him, who was very good for morale. Helped get more  stability on campus and a lot more respect. We also had some good things  happen including our very first ever Rhodes Scholarship. Increasingly, the  Office of Scholar Development was being formed. So students were  winning a number of other prestigious U.S. scholarships. In addition to that,  we had in the late 1990s a radical reorganization of the Honors College on  campus. Expanded and major improvements in both quality and quantity. So  we felt with all these good things going on, it was time to apply to Phi Beta  Kappa again.  We thought we really had a good shot. Especially because the new dean at  that point was himself a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He received honorary  membership. His wife, who was working at the Library, was also a member  of Phi Beta Kappa. We felt,    Okay, this is the time to try again.    We were  shocked because, once again, in 2000 I got this form letter saying the same  thing and giving us no critique, you know,    This is what you need to  improve on.    This time we were so puzzled that contact was made with the  national office.  Anyway, the OSU administration actually sent me to Washington D.C. to  meet with the primary person at the main headquarters. Interestingly, the  person who had just taken over the job, John Churchill, was from Arkansas  and his wife was from Oklahoma. He was very sympathetic, feeling that this  part of the country had been underrepresented. Oh, and he had been a  faculty member. He   d led his school   s attempt, and they went through lots of  rejections before finally getting it. He was very, very sympathetic. We got  into a discussion of what we should be trying to do better and he definitely  said apply again.  We applied again in 2006. This time we were still turned down at stage one,  but we got a lot more feedback. There were additional meetings. I think Bob  Graalman went to meet with them, and Bob Miller. I   m trying to remember  what stage President Hargis went to meet with them, so more and more  contact with the main office, which had become increasingly sympathetic to  us. Essentially saying,    We encourage you to think about the following  things.    At any rate, the 2009 application was the one that went well. Every  time we go through this cycle, the applications get longer and more  convoluted. I   ve sometimes referred to it as cruel and unusual punishment.  Fortunately, we had a lot of support from the administration, we had good  people on the committee, so we made it to stage two.  Stage two, because this is a three-year multi-phase process, stage two  involves submitting a second application even longer than the first one, even  more complicated. I was supposed to be on sabbatical that semester, but  ended up spending an awful lot of time working on the second round of the  application. Only a handful of schools are allowed to submit it. It used to be  a maximum of ten, now typically it   s a maximum of four or five that get to  stage two. We got positive feedback, so the message   a phone call from the  main office, was that pretty much if you get to stage two, stages three and  four usually are guaranteed. That   s not official, things could still go wrong.  So stage three was the on-site visit. This was much more complicated than  previous ones. Actually five people came and they were here for several  days, and of course we had umpteen activities, but everything went  smoothly. There were a few tense moments at certain meetings, but  everything basically went very well. Everybody on both ends behaved, I  think, quite well. So the final stage was the vote of the Phi Beta Kappa  delegates at the triennial meeting, which that year was held in Florida in  August.  Finchum In what year?  Gethner Twenty-twelve. Anyway, each group that was up for a vote was required to  send at least one delegate. We sent a whole committee. Burns Hargis, in  fact, was there himself. So this is very, very dramatic. A number of  fascinating things happened. It turns out that the then president of the Phi  Beta Kappa organization, president of the elected senate, happened to be the  son of a former faculty member at OSU, so there was a connection. He  actually had been to Stillwater. Lots of things went well, even leading up to  the final vote, and we got it. Then there were whole series of operations in  terms of getting the chapter up and running.  Finchum How did you celebrate that day when you knew you got it?  Gethner Actually, President Hargis had chartered a private plane to take everybody  back immediately after the vote, which was on a Saturday afternoon.  However, according to the regulations at least one person had to stick  around for a special meeting the following day, Sunday morning, with some  of the officials of headquarters to go through the procedures about the  various steps of setting the new chapter up on your campus. So Bob Miller  and I stayed an extra night, so we went out to one of the local restaurants to  celebrate. It was very exciting.  Finchum What had the University done in that last push to actually get it through?  Gethner There were a number of things that were going on. One of the most  important, I think, was the commitment of President Hargis in the  establishment of an art museum on campus. I mean that really helped. Plans  for the eventual construction of a performing arts center, expansion of the  headquarters for the radio station KOSU     Finchum All those addressed the cultural side of campus.  Gethner Yes, the cultural side of things, and the fundraising efforts to increase the  number of endowed chairs on campus. Those are some of the main things  that helped to     Finchum Move it along.  Gethner    move it along, yes.  Finchum The Library was an issue for a denial early on. What were some of the  things they did to improve that part?  Gethner There was a definite feeling that library resources, particularly the  construction of remote storage facilities, availability of electronic databases,  a lot of modernization of the library since the 1980s, improvements in the  amount of study space available, a big increase in the overall number of  volumes in the collection. In fact, there were actual passages in the final  application listing journals, including journals in foreign languages that the  Library subscribes to. The proofreading job going through all those lists was  quite horrendous.  Finchum It   s interesting to see those changes happening in the Library, but not  knowing, really, the motivation behind some of them.  Gethner We had some wonderful leadership at the Library in those years.  Finchum So when you came back to campus after this trip to Florida, did the group  get together then and congratulate each other or anything like that?  Gethner No, (laughs) but there was a meeting called early on in the fall semester of  the Phi Beta Kappa membership to elect officers and go through the plans.  Finchum Get it set up.  Gethner And also arrange for possible dates for the official installation ceremony,  which eventually took place in January the following year. So all the  principal officers from National as well as all the people who were on the  on-site visit committee, the committee on qualifications, came. Then of  course we had a big dinner for everyone and a reception at the president   s  house. It was all quite exciting. We got the actual charter which is     Abramson I just wanted to mention, I don   t know if you remember, but Hargis did have  a reception for the committee. It was in one of the rooms in the hotel.  Gethner Yes.  Abramson So just for the committee members he did have a reception. I remember that  because that   s where I got my football tickets. (Laughter) He asked me what  I would want.    I want football tickets.    I was able to sit in his box with  Zeyna, so he did do something with the committee.  Gethner Okay, yes. I   m not quite sure what else you want me to get into.  Finchum Once you had done all that you could do, you just have to turn it over and  say,    Okay I   m not touching this anymore   ?  Gethner The day will come.  Finchum Oh, you   re not there yet.  Gethner No. According to the   this is interesting. One of the things we had to do  immediately, in preparation for the installation ceremony, was to adopt a  constitution and bylaws. They sent us a template. Basically we had to sort of  customize and keep it at least 98 percent to what they had written. I was  elected president. Presidents and vice presidents are term limited, other  officers are not. I have been elected to a second term. Anyway, my term will  come to an end in 2017.  Finchum How long are terms then?  Gethner Two years. Everybody   s first term was extended.  Finchum Still had work to do. Has there been much support from other Phi Beta  Kappa members on campus to help?  Gethner Yes, a certain number of people have been very supportive, have shown up  to events. We have several active committees.  Finchum Roughly how many faculty on campus     Gethner Are members? About sixty.  Finchum Well beyond 2017, do you anticipate staying involved?  Gethner Yes. According to the bylaws, the immediate past president is a member of  the executive committee for at least one year.  Finchum Okay, so you can   t retire any time soon.  Gethner No. (Laughter)  Finchum Do you want to talk a little bit about the ceremony? The January ceremony?  Gethner It was held in the auditorium of Old Central.  Finchum Any particular reason why?  Gethner It was felt that would be the most appropriate place, as the Honors College   is based there  and it   s also where the first OSU graduation took place back  in the 1890s.  Finchum That makes sense.  Gethner And because it   s a beautiful room. Anyway, people were there in their  regalia.  Finchum If you were president, who were the other officers?  Gethner Bob Miller was elected as the vice president, Gene Halleck as secretary,  Jonathan Comer as treasurer and Charles  Abramson  here as our historian.  According to the bylaws those are the five official officers.  Finchum The process was over   if they started in the    70s it took over thirty years?  Gethner It took over thirty years. I was involved for almost a quarter of a century,  just my participation in this.  Finchum What kept you motivated?  Gethner Well, I actually felt this was something really important. First of all,  everybody agrees that having access to this particularly prestigious  organization is great for the students. We   re only talking about a tiny  fraction of the top students who are eligible for this. The students who  deserve it, are entitled to membership in the most prestigious academic  honor society in the country. It   s also a badge of honor for OSU indicating  that we do something right in terms of educating the students in the major  arts and science disciplines.  Finchum I   m assuming language is one of those.  Gethner Yes.  Finchum And that has probably been an issue throughout the whole process, did we  offer enough in that area?  Gethner That was certainly a question. Sometime in the    70s or    80s, and of course  since I was not active with the society at the time I don   t know when  precisely this happened, they actually pushed through specific requirements  in math and foreign languages. The requirements had always been that it  was not simply GPA, though that was one of the factors involved, but that a  faculty committee had to go through every transcript individually to make  sure that at least three-quarters of the coursework counted as what they  would consider serious rather than frivolous. And there should be a degree  of intellectual breadth as well as rigor in what the student did. Personally,  I   m not thrilled by having these special foreign language and math  requirements, which are quite rigid. Even though with foreign languages we  are, shall we say, more flexible than what National would like, I think the  local chapter should have a bit more flexibility.  Finchum For a time was computer science considered a foreign language?  Gethner No, not for purposes of Phi Beta Kappa. A lot of the departments on campus  would consider it as a foreign language for purposes of either foreign  language requirement for the doctorate or, in a few cases, for the  undergraduate degree.  Abramson As a Regents Professor your career is full of achievements. How does  bringing Phi Beta Kappa to OSU rank among them?  Gethner That   s definitely my number one legacy to OSU, along with my teaching.  This is something important. I suppose the other thing I should mention is  that I   ve set up an endowment to contribute to the functioning of the chapter.  So I pledge a substantial amount of money to that. That will also endure,  because one of the things that I seem to recall when I was inducted, unless  my memory   s playing tricks with me, is that the chapter picked up the fees. I  didn   t have to write home to my parents saying,    We need this money.     What we   ve done up until now is the students basically have to pay, used to  be fifty-five dollars, it   s gone up, to National plus whatever fee the local  chapter charges to defray the cost of the ceremony. The first couple of years  it was seventy-five dollars, now it   s eighty-five. It may go up again.  However, I did   when I notified the students that they were accepted, I said  that if people have financial hardship they can contact me and I would try to  arrange to pick up the cost through my endowment. There   s not enough in  that particular endowment to help out with more than seven or eight students  per year. We couldn   t subsidize everybody.  Dean Stringer has since set up an endowment of his own primarily for the  purpose of paying for all student memberships. Though I still have to talk to  our treasurer and our financial consultants in Whitehurst, I believe that there  is enough money in his endowment that as of this year we can subsidize all  the students, and nobody will have to pay.  Finchum Roughly, each year how many students qualify?  Gethner About twenty. I   m not sure if we   ll ever go above thirty.  Finchum Are there more that actually qualify and don   t know that they do? Who takes  on the responsibility to make sure that those who do meet the requirements  actually get considered?  Gethner That is the president and the committee, and the committee is appointed by  the president. I   m in the process of reconstituting the committee for this  year.  Finchum But do they go through every graduating     Gethner No. What I do is I contact the registrar   s office every spring semester, I   ve  just done this a couple days ago, with a document called the stipulations  document. That   s Phi Beta Kappa   s term, not mine. This lists what sorts of  things   essentially we tell the registrar   s office,    Please send us a list of  students who have achieved this many credit hours       (Essentially they   ve  got senior status, doesn   t mean they   re going to graduate next semester),    a  GPA of       (our minimum is 3.7), and have all the other   whole bunch of  other things that we require. Then they send us a list of names. That comes  to me. Then the next step is, since I have the list of who was inducted  already and the registrar   s office doesn   t have that, I have to go through their  list and check off the names of people who are already members.  Yesterday I received the list, so this is stage one of the process. There were  fifty-three names. Six of them are already members, so obviously we   ll not  consider them again. Of the remaining forty-six there were ten people we  considered last year. Two of them we rejected, the others we accepted and  they didn   t join. I will talk to the committee and ask whether they think  these other people should get a second chance. Once the committee has  weighed in I will get back to the registrar   s office and ask them to send the  transcripts for just these particular students. So there will be, at most, forty-six  transcripts that we will go through, as opposed to say about 900-and  some people, on average, who graduate each year from the College of Arts  and Sciences.  Finchum Still, forty-three is a large number to go through with a fine-tooth comb.  They would choose not to join because they didn   t have the money or     Gethner I don   t think it was the money, because in my email to the students, as well  as the paper letter, (I think it was just in the email), that if there   s a financial  problem they should let me know, and several people did. Yeah, one person  actually declined, after I had spoken to him in person and he   s majoring in  my department. I was really quite shocked. The other people simply never  responded. One of the problems we know is that there   s so many of these  honor societies floating around nowadays that the students have never heard  of, they don   t know one from the other. They don   t realize only a couple of  them are really legitimate. Some of them are essentially bogus. This one is  worth joining.  Finchum It   s a little more about educating, informing people?  Gethner Yes. So I am hoping that   I   ll be proposing that we have, maybe in the Arts  and Sciences magazine or maybe the OSU magazine, an interview with  Dean Stringer now that his endowment is up and running. So again, giving  us a bit more name recognition.  Finchum It   s still relatively new     Gethner Yes, it is.  Finchum    two years, three years. This year   s, I think, the 240th anniversary of the  whole thing?  Gethner Yes, it was founded in 1776, which is an easy date to remember.  Finchum So maybe tie into that for your information this year. So looking back for  when you joined yourself back in the    60s, did you envision having this type  of role?  Gethner No.  Finchum Fast forward fifty years?  Gethner No. One doesn   t have a very clear sense as an undergraduate what   s  involved except we know this is a big honor. It   s basically something you  put on your resume, and you don   t think about doing something with the  society after that.  Finchum On your resume, have you noticed a difference? I mean in those years you  were unemployed, did it seem to help?  Gethner I don   t know whether anybody noticed it on my resume when I was  applying for jobs.  Abramson Do you remember your secret handshake?  Gethner No, to be perfectly honest. (Laughs)  Abramson I still remember mine.  Finchum You had a secret handshake?  Abramson Oh yeah.  Gethner That   s a hangover from the founding of the organization when they were a  secret society. I did not know why it was a secret society until I actually read  the   there   s a whole book on the history of Phi Beta Kappa. The reason  why it had to be secret was students did not have academic freedom. That   s  also the reason why they had to meet at a tavern off campus. Essentially this  was a debating club for the discussion of serious ideas as opposed to just a  drinking club, just a social organization. They would often get into  controversial topics. One time they actually discussed slavery. We   re talking  about Virginia in the 1770s. They would not have been allowed to talk about  any of these things on campus. That   s why they were officially called the  secret society.  Finchum The secret handshake would have significance     Gethner Yeah.  Finchum Was it the same for everyone or     Abramson Don   t know, because I   m not supposed to reveal the secret handshake.  (Laughs)  Gethner I assume it   s the same for everyone.  Abramson When you became a Phi Beta Kappa, of course you said your parents were  very, very happy. Did you do anything special?  Gethner I don   t recall. (Laughs) It was a long time ago.  Abramson My mother   s buried with my original Phi Beta Kappa key. She thought that  was the best thing I could ever do.  Finchum Did they add something to the diploma? Like a     Abramson Not for us.  Gethner I don   t think so. It might   ve been mentioned in the program.  Finchum Does it show up on transcripts?  Gethner No.  Abramson I don   t think   it   s been a long time. I don   t    think     Finchum Some diplomas will say summa cum laude or whatever.  Abramson But that   s conferred by the school, Phi Beta Kappa is not. It   s a private  organization based at the school.  Finchum Moving forward, what do you anticipate for the chapter?  Gethner I really don   t know. Obviously, one of the challenges is to try to keep up a  number of activities. One of the primary activities is an annual lecture series.  Last year we had a competition that we sponsored during Campus Research  Week.  Finchum Can you lose your chapter?  Gethner According to the constitution, yes. There are actually procedures in place for  revoking a charter, though I actually contacted the national headquarters  about this. They said that this has been on the books since, I think, the  1930s, but it   s never been invoked.  Finchum I   m just curious if you have to keep up records and keep the application  active.  Gethner No, but we are required to submit an annual report to National. That   s one of  the principal jobs of the secretary. They will ask us things like how many  students did you accept for membership, how many accepted, what activities  did you do, what was the attendance at these activities, things of that nature.  Finchum As new faculty are hired, is that something that comes up, too?  Gethner That   s something we need to work on, to see if we can actually get the word  out at some kind of new faculty meeting, to let Phi Beta Kappa people know  that they should be in touch with the officers, so we can include them on the  mailing list.  Finchum It takes up a little bit of your time.  Gethner Yeah.  Finchum Do you have anything else you want to ask, Charles?  Abramson Just to say that it   s been a real pleasure working with you on this.  Personally, I consider it one of the highest of my career.  Gethner It   s been great having you on the team.  Finchum And you had said this too, that accomplishing this was one of the highlights.  Do you want to mention a couple of the other highlights? You   ve risen to the  top and are slowing down a little bit.  Gethner Well, I don   t want to get into a bragging competition, (laughs) but yes, I was  promoted to Regents Professor a few years ago, which is     Finchum A big honor.  Gethner Yeah, and I have an endowed chair. I have had recognition on campus in  terms of my scholarly work. I have been very productive.  Finchum Any plans to retire?  Gethner Probably next year, though it could be postponed. I am getting older.  Finchum Will you stay in Stillwater?  Gethner At this point, probably yes. I don   t have any other plans of places to go to.  Finchum So when you consider home, you consider it here?  Gethner Yes.  Finchum And not back to Chicago?  Gethner Yeah, I don   t think I could handle the winters there after more than three  decades of living in the South. And there   s not much of my family left there.  Finchum OSU   s been lucky to have you, sounds like.  Gethner Thank you.  Finchum So appreciate you sharing your stories with us today.  Gethner Thank you so much for coming.  -------  -------
