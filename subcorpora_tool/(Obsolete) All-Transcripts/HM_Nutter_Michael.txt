Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, we ask five lightweight questions as a warm up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Sure.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?

Speaker 2: Yes, burgundy.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: You know, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] has four wonderful seasons and given that I have to pay for snow removal, I'm probably a little less partial to the winter.  I like spring, summer and fall the best.

Story_ID: 620389
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Basil Nutter, Jr.] side.
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We keep them separate and then we bring them together--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --once we get them both.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure it's Catalina, C-A-T-A-L-I-N-A Bargas [Catalina Bargas Nutter], B as in boy A-R-G-A-S.
Speaker 1: What is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: That would be July 12, 1934, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family and how back--how far back can you trace them and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: Well my mother and her twin sister and their younger brother grew up in South Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] around 9th [Street] and South [Street].  My mother's twin sister's name is Caralita [ph.] and her brother's name is William [ph.].  My grandmother's name is Edythe [Edythe Bargas].  Her husband, my mom's dad passed away when my mother was twelve years old his name was William Caruso [ph.], C-A-R-U-S-O. So obviously I never met him.  So they lived in South Philadelphia, they were in a Catholic parish of St. Peter Claver [St. Peter Claver Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in South Philly and my mother and sister attended Hallahan High School [John W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] from which they graduated and then went on to work, at the time it was called Bell Telephone [Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania] which ultimately now is known as Verizon [Verizon Pennsylvania, LLC].
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about the family's origin?  As far as you know were they always Philadelphians or did they (unclear) living in the South (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah as far as I know.  Yeah neither side, neither my father nor my mother's side.  We don't trace any, any history, at least back to their time or their parents' back to the South.  It seems to be a Philly, kind of Philly based family.
Speaker 1: And from the names is there an Italian connection in your family?
Speaker 2: William Caruso actually was Italian; my mother's father was Italian.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how he came to America?
Speaker 2: Don't know that story, never heard that, never heard that story but my mother always talked of him very, very fondly.  He was kind of more of the talking parent and my grandmother apparently was more of the disciplinarian.
Speaker 1: So was your grandmother on that side African American?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind the name Borgas [sic.]?  Now that's an Italian name.
Speaker 2: Bargas?
Speaker 1: Bargas (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I mean there is story that it may have originally been Vargas.  My mother tells me for some reason although it's not particularly clear to her that my grandmother may have changed it to Bargas with a B.  My, my grandmother apparently at times was involved with a fairly rough crowd in South Philadelphia.  It was a time of all kinds of speakeasies and gambling and all those kinds of things and she was you know, basically a single mom with three kids.  So I think she was kind of doing what she had to do to take care of her kids and send them to Catholic school and that kind of stuff.  So she had apparently an eclectic group of friends.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Did your mother share with you any aspirations that she wanted to reach that she you know, pursued through school?
Speaker 2: You know I think at that--back in those days for the most part graduating high school was often seen as enough.  Obviously I'm sure my grandmother would have wanted them to go to college but financially that may have been out of reach.  On the other hand, as I said coming right out of Hallahan they went right into the workforce and there were jobs available for young people at that time without a college degree.  But I can tell you it was always clear from the earliest time I can remember from both my mother and my grandmother and my father as well that they wanted us, my sister [Renee Nutter] and I to go to college and so a lot of kids back in my day their parents had not gone to college but clearly had the aspiration for their children.  My, you know, my friends or my peers for all of us to go to college and a lot of us did.
Speaker 1: I think there is a story behind the name St. Peter Claver and how it relates to the black community.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you tell it?
Speaker 2: Yeah that was--apparently that particular parish and that church was maybe one of their earlier parishes that had a significant African American population and African Americans felt very comfortable there.  So that's, I mean that's probably the biggest part of the story I, I know.  They had all kinds of parties and dances and other activities and I know my mother and her siblings and my grandmother attended a lot of those.
Story_ID: 620390
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure Basil, B-A-S-I-L Du Bois Nutter, Jr. [Basil Nutter, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay and Du Bois spelled the way W.E.B. Du Bois--
Speaker 2: Du Bois, yeah.
Speaker 1: --is spelled, okay. D-U-B-O-I-S okay.  What was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 23, 1933.
Speaker 1: Here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: In Philadelphia yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Now what do you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: He had--there were six in total. He had five siblings a brother and four sisters.  His mother, my grandmother her name was Olga [Olga Nutter], O-L-G-A and of course his father was Basil Du Bois Nutter, Sr. [Basil Nutter, Sr.].  They lived in South Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] as well.  My father grew up around 22nd [Street] and Montrose [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay. Is it--so on his side of the family too is Philadelphia all the way, right?
Speaker 2: Pretty much yeah.
Speaker 1: There are no stories about his or any relative being from someplace else?
Speaker 2: No not really and I mean as a kid we ne- you know I had a lot of friends in my neighborhood and of course they had you know, relatives and family--close family that were from southern cities and states and would often as we would say, go down south.  I never had that experience, never met any relatives down south.  The farthest south I went when I was a kid there with my parents was to Baltimore [Maryland] to see one of my father's--a couple of his army buddies.  But other than that no, we never made that trek.
Speaker 1: Yeah there have been black people since the late 1600s.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's interesting 'cause--all right now what did your father say about growing up in South Philly?
Speaker 2: Well my father I think fairly early on, you know kind of--my father was the first born of the kids.  His father left either completely or periodically from time to time and so he pretty early on assumed kind of a leadership role in the family.  He went to public schools and everybody worked trying to, trying to keep the family together.
Speaker 1: What did his mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a seamstress and worked in a--I don't want to say a factory or plant but worked for a company that made drapes and you know kind of heavy knit items. So yeah, that's what she did.
Story_ID: 620391
Speaker 1: Did your father [Basil Nutter, Jr.] talk about he wanted--what he wanted to be when he grew up?
Speaker 2: My father, who is since, since deceased a couple years ago, he was clearly a smart guy and ambitious guy and I think you know a lot of talent and focus.  I think that--I know from different conversations and stories I think much of that aspiration may have been curtailed--may have been short circuited by having to be you know kind of the man of the house, if you will, with his father [Basil Nutter, Sr.] not being around.  So trying to look after at least at that time three siblings, a brother and two sisters and then the other two sisters came along later.  My grandmother [Olga Nutter] had, had remarried.  I think that was a lot of responsibility fairly early on and clearly impacted his future opportunities.  I think he really did want to go to college and just didn't have that opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did he have a chance to finish high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where did he come out of high school?
Speaker 2: I think he finished at South Philly High [South Philadelphia High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I know he went to Barratt middle school for junior high [Norris S. Barratt Junior High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense of what South Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was like in those days?
Speaker 2: Not really, I mean, I'm sure when I was younger there were a lot more stories and the memories may have been a little more vivid but you know I think it was a bit of a melting pot kind of community.  But some levels of segregation if you will.  I mean you know we're talking about '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s] and maybe not the most enlightened time in the United States or even in some parts of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So you know I think there were a lot of tough lessons learned.  He was in the service; my father was in the [U.S.] Army, 82nd Airborne [82nd Airborne Division], stayed in the states.  His brother, Larry--Laurence [Laurence Nutter] actually I think forged his age so that he could go in the service.  He ended up getting shipped to, shipped to Korea during that, during that conflict at that time.  So he did military service and then was honorably discharged and out into the world of work.
Story_ID: 620392
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story that your parents [Catalina Bargas Nutter and Basil Nutter, Jr.] tell about how they met?
Speaker 2: I think it may have been at one of the St. Peter Claver [St. Peter Claver Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] dances or parties as I recall. And my mother's sister had already left the house and gotten married.  She married a fireman; there was a fire station down there by their house, moved out to West Philly [West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Her brother had already enlisted in the [U.S. military] service, he spent twenty plus years in the service mostly away.  So my mom was kind of the last one in the house there was her and my grandmother [Edythe Bargas].  So apparently it was a packaged deal and when my parents got married in '56 [1956], moved to West Philly to 55th [Street] and Larchwood [Avenue] my grandmother came along with them.  I was born the next year in, in '57 [1957].
Story_ID: 620393
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Catalina Bargas Nutter and Basil Nutter, Jr.] personalities and dispositions and mannerisms and talents their, their looks even, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: You know, it's kind of interesting, I've been told by--I guess when I was younger and we were kind of out together, it would often be said that I was a bit of a perfect combination of the two.  It's clear when I look at photos now that there is an increasing, increasingly resemblance to my father but, excuse me, I mean I think I clearly have traits and characteristics, characteristics of both.
Story_ID: 620394
Speaker 1: Can you name your brothers and sisters and where you fit in?
Speaker 2: Well I just have a younger sister; she's five years younger, Renee [Renee Nutter].  She's--May 28, 1962 so there is just the two of us growing up.  So mother [Catalina Bargas Nutter], father [Basil Nutter, Jr.], grandmother [Edythe Bargas] and the two kids in a little house in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  When we moved to 55th [Street] and Larchwood [Avenue] or when they moved we were about the third black family on the block and as I recall by the time I kind of had that kind of awareness maybe about ten years old or so, I think there may have been three or four white families left, so I mean in a fairly short period of time there was a pretty significant turnover on the street.  But it was--I could best describe it as a bit of a middle middle class neighborhood.  Everybody worked, folks trying to, you know, make ends meet, wanting to send their kids to college, want a good neighborhood, want good homes, safe community and some kind of decent quality of life.  So I mean I don't, I don't think we were poor. We clearly were not rich or have any particular means but we had what we needed and never went without a meal, never went hungry.  My mother always figured out a way to make it all come together.
Speaker 1: We always ask this question like this and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, sights, one of the things I talk about in my work today is remembering Saturday mornings on our street on West Philly.  That was pretty much everybody out.  It was not a kind of a city sponsored thing, it wasn't, you know, it was just what we did and it everybody out cleaning their porch, their steps, their sidewalk.  Washing it down, hosing down and it was a real kind of community effort to make sure the block stayed clean and stayed in good, in good order.  And then after that you were free to go out and do your chores.  My mom would basically say, "Go outside; don't come back until dinnertime."  And whether we played right in the street or went to the rec center, went to the swimming pool, went to the library or went to a park, everything was right there.  So my world, to some extent, was about two blocks around the house and you pretty much had everything that--two, three blocks around the house and you pretty much had everything you needed.  I had a lot of fun as a kid growing up, spent a lot of time out in the street, football, baseball, stickball, king block, wall ball, step ball everything. And just a lot of really great memories.  Had my own crew of friends and then there was some older guys, three or four years older, those were our old heads and things that maybe we didn't necessarily learn from our parents, you know, we kind of took some of those lessons from them.  And it was, it was just a great, it was a great time.
