Speaker 2: My favorite food is probably collard greens.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter), when I grew--was growing up I didn't like greens.  Didn't like that kind of food, but as I grew older I guess I acquired appreciation for them because I really like good collard greens.
Speaker 1: It was that good?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is probably blue.

Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year is summertime, the hotter the better.  Being from Ohio we have all the seasons and they can be very extreme.  And I've served my time in the cold weather so when I retire and move some place it will be some place where you see snow on television.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I would say my vacation destination is Hawaii.  I really like the climate, the people, the weather, so I kinda like the islands.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Story_ID: 56052
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Well, let's, let's talk about your beginnings.  Can you give us the name of your mother and spell it for us please and her date of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Florida Small spelled just like the state, F-L-O-R-I-D-A, last name Small.  She was born October 17, 1924.
Speaker 1: Okay and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your father?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Walter Small, W-A-L-T-E-R, last name Small, S-M-A-L-L.  He was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi also on May the 12th, 1917.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do, do your parents have any stories about their family history or did you get any stories from your grandmother about where the family came from?
Speaker 2: Right.  My parents were born--both born and raised in Clarksdale, Mississippi, very humble beginnings.  My father actually was raised by his maternal grandmother because father was nowhere around; mother had a large number of children so they divided up the children.  So he was actually--him and his twin brother was actually raised by grandmother.  And he was very, very poor.  He tells stories of growing up at Christmastime the most they ever received was a paper cap gun and an orange.  That's was their Christmas for them.  He had to work a lot; grandmother had to work a lot.  So he would tell stories about Mississippi and Clarksdale growing up in those days.  He worked for the WPA [Works Progress Administration] when he was like 15, 16, you had to be a certain age and he was too young, but he chose the story of when they were building Highway 61, and anybody from Mississippi knows Highway 61, and he actually worked on that road, building that road and he was too young to work that road 'cause you had to be at least 16.  I think he started like when he was 12 or 13 and they were hiring people to work for the railroad and everybody knew everybody and they wouldn't hire him and they had a white owner down there who was a big person in the community and he asked him, "Well are you Celrealis (ph) son?"  And he said "Yes."  And he says--this man said, "Well hire him."  And they called this man, he had a limp and they called him Limping Jesus because he was kinda like God down there.  He made all the rules and so forth, so that's how he got to work on this railroad--I mean this road.  He told story--he was in the military when my mother and grandmother first came up here and he said to my mother, find some else--other place to live 'cause I'm not going back to Clarksdale to live.  He didn't like the way blacks were treated in Mississippi at that time.  He tells stories that he worked for Kroger Grocery story and he delivered groceries on a bicycle with a basket with the groceries.  And, of course the high schools were segregated and when--and white high school had a swimming pool, of course, the minority high school did not.  And when students were swimming in the swimming pool, they posted a policeman out on the street to stop all the black people from passing by the school where the swimming pool was at 'cause they didn't want black men to see white females swimming in the swimming pool.  So they had them detour three or four blocks to go around the school. So that were some things that he encountered as a youth down there so, and both my mother and father, the farthest they got in school was eighth grade.  They both had to work.  My mother [Florida Small] was raised by my mother--my grandmother, no father in the home.
Story_ID: 56053
Speaker 1: So basically they told a lot of stories about Mississippi and, and as a youth we use to go down there and travel and go down there to Mississippi and visit my grandmother and so forth.  And she lived right next the county jail.  And we would see the prisoners dressed in their black and white striped suits.  And they're mostly black, working out there with the balls and the chains and so forth so, you know, and I can remember going down to Mississippi in the car.  We would drive down and beginning stopped by police officers, I mean, like three, four o'clock in the morning, pulls us over, shines the light on my father and all of us, you know, where you going boy, you know, you were speeding.  I mean like we're going like twenty miles an hour and they're pulling us over asking us what you're doing speeding?  So those kind of experiences my father talked a lot about, talked a lot about sickness, lot of relatives and friends contracting tuberculosis and, and dying.  So a lot of talks about Mississippi and things that went on down there and knew a lot of people down there.  So--but he thought that he could do much better for his family if he lived someplace else.  And I still have relatives who live down in Clarksdale.  And I haven't been back there since the '60's [1960s].
Story_ID: 56054
Speaker 1: Okay, okay then.  So you, you were born here in Akron [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I was born in Akron.  My two older brothers were born in Clarksdale, Mississippi and I have--there's six of us all together, six boys and no sisters.  My parents wanted a daughter but after six boys they said we really don't think we really want a daughter (laugher) and so my two oldest brothers were born in Clarksdale, Mississippi and the rest of us was born up here in Akron.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact I was born at home, you know.  When the doctor got here I was already here.  I tell people, "I couldn't wait for the doctor, couldn't wait to go the hospital.  I was ready to come; I was ready to go."
Story_ID: 56055
Speaker 1: All right.  Did your grandparents tell any stories about reconstruction of slavery or any, any of those kinds of stories?
Speaker 2: Well my grandparents basically talked a little bit about things.  They didn't talk a whole like.  But my grandmother on my mother's side, she was raised-- her mother and father died at a real early age, when she was young.  And my grandmother's mother was a full-blooded Indian and her father was a preacher and died at an early age and so it was three or four of them and they were raised by aunts and uncles and so forth and so they were shuffled around.  And so she instilled in us that we have to sort hang together as a family.  And that you don't put people in nursing homes, you take care of each other.  And so this stories that she gave us, she talked about those kinds of things how tough it was growing up.  How they didn't know a lot of people, how they didn't have very much, so it was--stories they gave us was struggles and poverty and hard times.  My grandmother worked in people's homes down there.  They couldn't own things.  Property was hard to acquire so those are the kind of stories they tell about Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Tough, tough life?
Speaker 2: Tough life, people didn't own very much, they struggled, didn't have a lot of clothes, not the kind of jobs they should have down there.  Most people were sharecroppers, where they raised cotton.  And if you didn't do the right things, they wouldn't allow you to be a sharecropper or take things away from you.  My grandmother came up here doing War World II when my father was in the military and to work in the war industry.  She built tank trays for the tanks here at B.F. Goodrich and my mother came up here with her with my two older brothers and we've been here ever since.
Story_ID: 56056
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Can you tell me then some of the stories of, of that--well not stories necessarily, but can you describe the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Akron [Ohio] in the neighborhood that you grew up in here?
Speaker 2: Akron is a very unique kind of community.  And when my family first moved here they lived on the north side of town, they lived under a viaduct.  We had a big high level bridge and they lived under the bridge.  And they were renting here and in fact my grandmother stayed there for many, many years.  And we rented until I would say 1946, we moved on to the south side of town and I as actually born in that house which was about a half mile from here.  And the neighborhood was a real ethnic neighborhood.  There was Italians section, a heavy Italian population.  There was a heavy Germany population, there were African Americans, there was a large group of folks.  In fact, there was a German American Club, Croatian Club, Manacour (ph) Club which were all ethnic clubs in that neighborhood.  And everyone got along really, really well.  It's all single family homes with yards and so forth and so at Akron you got that homey neighbor.  And we actually had a real neighborhood where everybody played with everybody, everybody looked out for everybody.  You didn't dare do things that you shouldn't do 'cause everybody would say, "I know your parents, I'm gonna tell on you."  So everybody looked out for everybody and everybody had a good feeling about the neighborhood.  We grew up with the idea that adults were important, that you had to treat everybody with respect.  My mother [Florida Small] worked part of the time and then she basically came home.  My father [Walter Small] worked a tremendous number of hours.  He probably worked--he worked in a rubber factory, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for thirty something years and he would work a shift and anytime there was overtime, he would work over.  I mean sometimes he would worked 18, 20 hours a day 'cause he knew we needed that money.  We had, you know, our own home at that particular point and we basically grew up understanding that family is very, very important.  He taught us--my mother taught us you that you have to look out for one another.  That you may not have everything in the world but as long as you have family and each other, you're rich.  And so we grew up basically we had school clothes that you wore and you came home, you took them off, you put on your play clothes and you had one set you wear one week and you had another set you wear the other week.  And you didn't have a whole lot of items, you took care of them.  And yeah, I went to school with cardboard in the bottom of my shoes, sometimes (laughter).  You know, when you have holes in your shoes.  When I grew up the dream was to grow and be able to get a pair of Converse All Stars.  They cost $10.95, high tops, that's what everybody wanted 'cause we had those K-Mart specials that people talked about, you know, the bubble gum shoes and they were like $3.00 or $4.00.  But everybody wore their pair of Converse All Stars and few and far kids had them, you know.  And at that time, the dream was to go to school and graduate from high school.  That's what our parents and everybody said, "You have to graduate from high school."  So the goal was to get out of high school 'cause a lot of people were not graduating from high school.  And it was important in my household that you could not come home with certain kind of grades.  That you were going to do well, you were in big trouble.  You couldn't come home--you had to behave in school, you had to have discipline, that you had responsibilities in the home.  We had jobs were you--our mother made sure we all learned how to wash, cook, sew, iron, all those things because she said, "you're  have to take care of yourself one day."  So she made us do all those things.  She even taught us how to buy women's clothing.
Speaker 1: Even though you were all boys?
Speaker 2: Even though we were all boys.  She said someday you're gonna have to--you may be married and you may have to buy some for your wife and your wife may be sick and need something.  And we used to get embarrassed when she would take us into the department stores and show us how to buy women's underwear (laughter).  And we're embarrassed with, you know, little guys in there but she taught us all those things 'cause she wanted us to be able to be equipped with those tools to survive.  So we grew up understanding that family was-- family, God and education was important.  And those three things keep us safe.  And we traveled as a family, even though we're a poor family, my father made sure we went on vacation every year so we could see the world.  We visited the most of the states, we visited all over the place.  And that kinda helped us grow together.  And the res--the, the biggest things my farents--my parents taught us was that family is a responsibility, you have to look out for one another and don't wait for somebody to do something for you, you have to get out there and make things happen for yourself.
Story_ID: 56057
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you like school?  I mean, when you started out school, we know where you are now, but how did you feel then?
Speaker 2: I was not a real big fan of school.  I was kind of quiet, kind of shy.  Had some struggles in school, had difficulties, but always had that confidence, my parents, my father [Walter Small], my mother [Florida Small] always taught me, you know, "Don't let anybody tell you, you can't do something.  You can do anything you put your mind to it."  And so he always taught us that.  And so I had some struggles in school, but I enjoyed school, you know.  I didn't let people telling me what I couldn't do.  I remembered when I was in high school, I decided, you know, I wanted to go to college and my parents said, we don't had any money for you to go to college, but stay at home.  And so on and so forth.  So I decided that I was going to go to college and so I started working full time.  I worked full time and stayed at home without paying rent or anything.  But school was something I thought was important, so when I got outta--when I started going to high school, I went to a vocational high school 'cause I knew you had to make a living for yourself.  So I wasn't going to take a chance and get out school and not have a skill, so I enrolled in a vocational school in carpentry to become a carpenter.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now let me go back to grade school for a minute.  Where your parents active in the school?
Speaker 2: Very active.  My mother was very active in the PTA [Parents and Teachers Association].  In fact, she became the President of the PTA.  My father was not active because he was always at work.  My father would go to work and six o'clock in the morning, six o'clock in the evening he was still at work, working overtime, that kind of thing.  But he was not active in the school aspect of it, but he was active from the standpoint of looking at your report card, "Boy don't bring those grades home here, you gotta do this."  He would come up when there was difficulties if we got into any kind of trouble, anything like that.  He was Johnny-on-the spot.  But she was--my mother was very active in our schooling and making sure we were doing what we should do, homework.  If you came home without homework, they gave you homework.  And these are folks who didn't have a, you know, big education, but education was something they felt was our way out.  That there was something once you had it, nobody could take it away from you.
Speaker 1: So they got together on that?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Their thinking was (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right.  When it come to us, they were together on most things.  It was no, no debating, no difference between them.  It was that-this is something you had to do, there's no debate.
Story_ID: 56058
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what were your favorite subjects in school and who were your favorite teachers in, in grade school?
Speaker 2: Well my favorite subject throughout school was always history.  I love history; I just love history.  And until this day, I still love history.  My favorite teachers--one of my fav--kindergarten teachers was my favorite teacher, she's still around Abby Wilasie (ph).  She was my first teacher and one that I remembered the most.  She still alive, but she's in a nursing home today.  And whenever I got into the system, whenever I got a promotion, I would always get a call from her.  Until she got to the point that she has Alzheimer and so forth and she, she doesn't even know I'm superintendent which is one of my regrets.  One of my real heroes is a teacher by the name of James Scrubs.  He's the one that really got me started in business.  He was my Phys. Ed [physical education] teacher in elementary school.  My kinder--when I was in kindergarten, first grade, he was a Phys. Ed teacher.  And he was the first African American teacher I've ever seen, you know.  And he was really tough on everybody.  I mean, he took no stuff off of anybody.  And--but he was the one when I graduated from high school, he was in charge of Neighborhood Youth Group which was a program they started back in the '60's [1960s] to employ inner center youth in the summertime, you know.  And he had some students who wanted to enter in the soapbox derby and they were gonna build cars and so forth.  And he had nobody help him build cars, so he came to me and said, I got these sixteen kids that want to build soapbox derby race cars.  We got somebody to donate a building, we got the materials and, you know, would you consider doing this and we'll pay you through the NCY?  So what I did I said, Yeah I'll do it.  And that's when I fell in love with teaching.  And from that point on, you know, I was the fast track--this is what I wanna do.
Story_ID: 56059
Speaker 1: Now what other activities did you enjoy when you were a little boy, you know, going to grade school?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed the playground, 'cause we played baseball, football, basketball.  In fact, in this building what we are in right now, we used to--this building had a coal furnace and they had those little manhole covers, we had to they up and then backup the truck and then send the coal down the coal chute.  Well we used to pick up that chute, slid down the coal chute, come into the building and play basketball in gym (laughter), you know and then we would go out and nobody ever knew we was here.  Nobody every damaged anything or destroy anything, but we use to come in here and play basketball.
Speaker 1: Weren't' you awful dirty when you got home (laughter)?
Speaker 2: When we down the chute, it was a little dirty but we kinda got ways where you knock that coal dust off you.  But you know, they wouldn't deliver coal that often, you know, but, you know, nobody ever knew that's what we did.  But I enjoyed hiking in the woods and camping and stuff like that.  We use to go camping in the woods, by ourselves sometimes, you know.
Speaker 1: So you weren't in the Boys' Scouts or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in Boys' Scouts for a while, but you know, I got through part of it, but, somehow the Boys' Scouts didn't click.  My younger brother right under me, he went all the way through as an Eagle Scout.  But, you know, I got sidetracked on other things.  I really enjoyed technology and stuff like that.  I always like that stuff, tinkering with things.  I really had a love for building model airplanes and model cars and ships and stuff like that.  I use to spend all my money doing those kinds of things.  I just buy models and models and models and put them together, 'cause building things was always something that I really loved.
Story_ID: 56060
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now what high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to [Central-] Hower Vocational High School.  It was a high school that strictly dealt with careers.  And we had auto mechanics, auto body, printer ship trades, machine shop, electricians.  You know, it was a pretty good size high school, very few young ladies in the school.  'Cause the only thing the young ladies could be at that time was Cosmetology and that was in their--one class at each grade level.  A tenth grade class, eleventh grade class.  There were about fifty of those ladies and then where were about two or three in Commercial Art, and then General Assistance had about twenty, and that was eleventh and twelfth grade class.  And there was probably about 600 guys in that building, 700 guys in that building and probably about 100 girls (laughter).  So needless to say the girls got a lot of potential at that school.  And it was kind of a boring place.  So we kinda created things, you know, we did a lot of things, you know.  I'll tell you the story that I tell kids, you know.  In carpentry we were very creative.  We build things, we had our own little business where we went out and finished rec rooms and did basements for people and kitchens and so forth.  And we, you know, you would go to our academic classes in the morning and all afternoon you're in that shop, so you were there probably there three fourths of the day.  And so we had two-part of the shop.  One-part was the main place and the other part was the project room where you could keep things.  So we started to go out there, we had a little gambling casino out (laughter) there and it was an Acme across the street, a grocery store, we would climb out the window and go across the grocery store and buy a pop, and potato chips and stuff like that.  And we built these poker tables, you know, we built poker tables and, you know, all kinds of stuff.  And we would--had this little team where we'll go and have--make sure that no more than three or four or five people were missing from the shop at one time, so the teacher wouldn't understand what was going on.  And then people from the other parts of the building start coming down, you know.  Shop upstairs, the auto mechanics were coming down, the electricians were coming down.  And one day we got our signals crossed and there was only one person in the shop.  The teacher looked up and was, where's everybody at?  And looked around, looked in the backroom, nobody there.  Went out to the shop--the room where we were at and there must have been sixty people in there.  I mean, smoke coming out, 'cause guys were smoking cigarettes and guys gambling a lot of money on the table, so (laughter), so what happen was he got rid of all that stuff and nailed the door shut and nailed the window shut, and we couldn't go out there anymore.  But we did things like that, that not wasn't a whole lot of trouble, but, you know, just to keep some interest going.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of stuff.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  So people ask me, "So how do you know where kids hide in schools and the things they do," I was a little--I was quiet, but I was also a little mischievous in interest along the way.
Speaker 1: That's, that's really creative too, 'cause to create a mini casinos on the school, you know.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) I mean, guys at that school--I mean there's guys in the print shop, we all had money that looked like real money with our pictures on it, 'cause the shop printed those things up (laughter).  We--everybody had these little things that they did.  I mean, it was a very creative place, a very creative place.
Speaker 1: Sounds like it, sounds like it.
Story_ID: 56061
Speaker 1: So when you were in [Central-Hower Vocational High] school, you thought you would pursue some trade, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Carpentry and went all the way through and--at that particular point when you graduate there you had to go into an apprentice program and you got two years' experience in being--going through our program.  And basically I decided, that yeah, my reason for being there was I wanted to have a skill that I could always use and get a job 'cause I, you know, it was impressed upon us that you must work, work is important and in order to live you have to work.  There's no such thing as living off of other people, you have to work.  So that's why I went into a vocational school.  And--so when I was getting ready--my junior year, senior--in my senior year, I went to the counselor and said, you know, I'm doing fairly well, I think I'll like might to try college.  He lifted his head and said, "Well you really don't look like college material, let me help you find--let me help find you a job."  And so I told my father [Walter Small] that and my father said, "Well are you going to let him tell you what to do with your life?  You know I've told you don't let anybody tell you what you gonna do with your life, you know, don't let people tell you what to do with it, what you're gonna do.  It's your decision and if that's what you wanna do, do it.  If you wanna go to school, go to school."  So I did go out to the job he offered me and what was funny was that I go for a job with some guys in my classroom, to one of the local lumber companies.  And they take them and take them and put with building and construction things and take me over to this railroad crossing where they had these boxcars full of lumber, like seven of them and tell me to start unloading these boxcars (laughter).  So I said, "No this is not, this is--this not for me, you know.  There's more to life then doing this."
Speaker 1: Was this a racial discrimination?
Speaker 2: Oh I kinda of figured and looked at it that way.  I mean, I'm the only black one there (laugher).
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean, it was always decided that you were the one--(unclear).
Speaker 2: So I, I didn't take the job.  I said "No, I said no, you know, you know.  I'm not, you know, there's other things I'm gonna do, I'm not gonna do that."  I'm looking down--I'm always the person looking down the road.  My father told us you can't always look at your shoes and feet here and now, you have to prepare and look down the road.  So--and all of my brothers are that way.  My mother [Florida Small] and father did a wonderful job of raising us.  We are all successful.  We all take care of each other and we all look out for each other.
Speaker 1: That's good, that's good, it a good-- a very good attitude.
Story_ID: 56062
Speaker 1: So, so what, what--were you involved in any extra curriculum activities in [Central-Hower Vocational] High School?
Speaker 2: In high school I ran cross-country, did a little bit of basketball.  A number of these clubs and so forth, organizations.  School can't just be about academics and going to school.  You have to be--it made you more well-rounded when you engaged in those things.  So I got involved in all of those kinds of things and also outside.  I always got involved with also helping younger kids, you know.  For some odd reasons if you have younger brothers you get use to helping younger kids and so I did that and I that and I enjoyed that, I enjoyed working with people, so I knew that, you know, like I said after working with those kids in soap box derby, I knew exactly what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 56063
Speaker 1: So we were talking about high school [Central-Hower Vocational High School] and towards the close of high school you were considering going--well you were talking about your advice from your counselor about going to college.  And so, well--what did you decided (unclear) to do about college?.
Speaker 2: I listen to my father [Walter Small].  I, I've learned, always listen to your parents 'cause your parents are your best friend.  Rather you know it or not, your parents are your best friend.  They were my best friend.  And they gave me that solid foundation and they always told us that, you know, we can teach you right or wrong and so forth, but at a certain point it's up to you, you gotta make your own decisions.  And whatever decision you make, we'll stand behind your decision.  So I made the right decision to go to school.  In our household, graduating from high school was not an option.  But anything after that was an option, 'cause nobody in our family had ever--my two older brothers graduated from high school and went to the military you know, and that was one of my options but, you know, Vietnam [War] was going on at that time and I had a premonition that I graduated in 1965 when it was really heating up at that time, if you got draft--and the draft was going on and if you weren't' in school you were going to be drafted and you were going to Vietnam.  I had a premonition if I was to got--if I got drafted and went to the military, I was going to die in Vietnam, 'cause I knew I was going to go to Vietnam and I knew I wasn't coming back.  So when I graduated from high school, I was just turning nineteen, no I was eighteen and I graduated in June.  In December I got a draft notice and I decided I needed to earn some money to go to school so I had to earn some money.  So I started working and I got a draft notice in December to go up for the draft.  And I'd also, at that very same time, I enrolled in school and it was too late to get classes and so it was going to be another semester, but I had a notice to be inducted to get drafted a month before my nineteenth birthday.  And I went up to the university and talked to a gentleman at the university and he basically took pity on me and hand-registered me and allowed me to go the University of Akron [Ohio], otherwise I would have never gotten into college.  And at that time they were giving student deferments where if you were a full-time student in school and kept your grades up, you could, you know, stay as long as you kept a 2.0.  It took a full load and I did go to the pre-induction physical and actually got inducted but it was deferred.  So, you know, that was an extra incentive that you need to go to school.  Where had I taken that job and not gone, I'd been in the military.  And now a lot of my friends went, a lot of guys I went to school went over there were killed and lot are messed up from going off to the war over there.  Nobody that I know went there and came back the same.  So I guess in a way God looked out for me and kinda guided my steps.
Story_ID: 56064
Speaker 1: Ok. Also in '65 [1965] Civil Rights Movement is heating up considerably.  They did some big milestones, the March on Washington and all of that, how did all of that affect you as a young man?
Speaker 2: It affected me greatly.  I saw all that stuff on television.  My parents talked a lot about the way we were treated and so forth.  And I--my father [Walter Small] taught us that "No matter what anybody says or does to you, you're just as good as anybody else.  Don't let anybody ever treat you any differently and don't take stuff from people" and don't feel like you're second class.  My father always believed in being first class.  And so he wouldn't allow people to treat us that way and he wouldn't let anybody treat him that way.  And he would, you know, he said at some point and sometime you gotta in peoples' face.  And we had marches at the school, marches in town, we had our little--in town we had where a part of the town was--we had a riot in part of the town in the '60's [1960s] and so forth.  So we've had all those things and we got engaged in those things and protested those things, but my father told us that you're not a follower, you have to be a leader.  So you have to know who you are, know what you're doing and you have to lead.  Don't just be a crowd follower or a crowd pleaser.  So that's why I was never much of a big follower.  And none of my brothers are that way.  And he also taught us that you have to be focused.  You have to have goals and be focused.  And my number one goal during that time was to get out of high school and then get out of college [University of Akron] and graduate.  And so--and I was--and I worked full time the whole time I was in college.  College was a new experience to me.  The first year I went to college, I went to work--I went to school, my first class was at eight o'clock in the morning, my last class was at--ended at three o'clock in the afternoon.  And I worked from four to midnight and I almost flunked out of school.  And then I--I  worked at a small rubber factory and basically I started at the point where school was important, so important and would quit a job, get another job so it wouldn't interfere with my classes.  But I was determined that I was not gonna let school defeat--my father taught us that you never let anything get thing get the best of you.  And so none of us allowed anything to get the best of us.  We hang in there and struggle with it, and fuss with it or wrestle with it and in the end we prevailed.  And it's that determination that he taught all of us that you have to do that.
Story_ID: 56065
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, okay, you had a position in a, in a country western bar or something at one (unclear) (simultaneously) --
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: I had a job--I--when I was in college [University in Akron] I had a variety of jobs.  I was a porter in a hillbilly bar and I know term porter is foreign to a lot of people, but that's the person who cleans up the bar, mops the floors, cleans up and that kind of thing.  And in that bar, it was a hillbilly bar.  I was the only black thing from miles and miles around.  It was--it was a restaurant and it had a bar attached to it and the restaurant stayed open twenty-four hours.  My grandfather, at that time, worked for these people who owned about four or five of these different bars and restaurants and, and I'll quit one job and go to another job and I needed a job to pay tuition so he got me a job working for them.  And so at this bar, I worked out there and like I said I was the only black thing there.  People treated me--employees there treated me really well.  I have to say they were really good.  The owners of the place treated great.  And they--in fact they were sadden when I said, "Well, you know, I gotta go on to another job that's make more money" and so forth and they said, "We can work over it, we got these other place you could work" but I said "No, I found a job paying more money."  And this bar was pretty wild at night 'cause the rest of the bar part would close at two-thirty.  And then the restaurant be open the rest of the night.  As the bars closed, everybody from all surrounding bars and places would come in there and they were wild and sheriff would come and people were throwing-up in the bathrooms and taking off their clothes and fighting in the parking lots and stuff like that.  So it was real experience for me.  But nobody really treated me, made any racial slurs at me or treated me bad or anything like that.  All of my jobs were growing experiences for me.  My father [Walter Small] taught us that you can learn from everybody in every circumstances.  And don't be like some people that you have to pay for learning by your mistakes, but learn and, and grow and so I took those experiences from all the jobs I had taking experiences and used them.
Story_ID: 56066
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell me about the University of Akron.  What was it like and did you have any teachers there that made a bigger impression on you or any other faculty or staff or any--(unclear)(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --any other staff people.
Speaker 2: At the University of Akron and when I went up there and when enrolled in, in January of '66 [1966] was my first experience there.  And I had the great the great pleasure of, of my brother, younger brother, Leonard, right under me, joining me in the fall of '66 [1966].  So it was nice to have companionship from my brother.  And there were not a large number of, of African Americans at the University at that time and there were some who felt African Americans didn't below there, but I had people who, who looked out for me.  Professors, who took me under their wing, gave me extra help, made sure I got what I needed.  But there was some who felt that, you know, we didn't belong.  I was majoring in Education, I knew, and I never changed my major and my brother never changed his major 'cause my father always told us, "know what you gonna do," you know.  And so I never changed my major I had a duel major, History and Political Science and I wanted two degrees and taken out a course but a (unclear) education, and when I got ready to get out they said, well we don't have a certification in that.  So that gave me a Certification in Social Studies.  But I had the hours to have a cert--degree in both.  And I had some people who said well, you know, you're really not college material, you know, you don't belong here, things like that.  I had one particular professor in political science who was very brilliant and she--I always set in front of the classroom.  I was not going to sit in the back of the classroom.  My father taught us that you don't sit in the back, you sit in the front.  And so me and a few other minorities student would sit in the front and after about a week of class teacher said, "You know, we are all creature of habit, people sit in the same place and do the same things so we're gonna rotate, so we're gonna send everybody in the front row to the back rows and then every periodically we're gonna move you up a row."  We sat in the back of the classroom for the rest of the semester.  And, you know, I knew what that was all about.  And my brother, who was a major in chemistry had it a lot tougher than I did 'cause they started out with probably started out with probably sixty kids that were majoring in chemistry and now in four years they graduated sixteen students.  And he was the only African American out of the sixty-something to begin with.  And they would tell him things like, "Blacks don't belong in chemistry, they don't belong in calculus," and things like that, but I was that drive that father gave us that, you don't let people do that to you.  And he was smart enough that he never paid a dime, Ph.D. in Chemistry, never paid a dime to go to school.  Never paid a dime for a book, never paid a dime for a class.  In fact, he would help pay my tuition when I didn't have money 'cause part of his scholarship they wanted a local gentlemen, Mr. Oddem (ph) who was a father to everybody, got him a scholarship from General Tire, full ride that paid for his--all of this tuition, no matter how many courses he took for four years.  Another scholarship to pay for his books and the scholarship with General Tire included a summer job.  We made $650.00 a month and in 1966, that was a lot of money.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: And Mr. Oddem was the Head of the Urban League and he remembered us from when we were children, we would walk to the Urban League and--'cause they had a swimming pool, we would walk to the Urban League which was about three miles from our home.  And we didn't have money for a membership with the Urban League so he would allow us to work for and pay for a membership.  I wasn't but $10.00, but we couldn't afford $10.00.  So he would let us wash walls, paint, cut the grass, and things like that and earn--we would do it for like maybe three weeks something like that.  And we would earn a membership there.  So he always was a father to everybody and in town.  And so--and when you had that membership, you could swim anytime you wanted to swim for free with that membership card.  You could go to day camp in the summertime where they had all kinds of recreation things so those kinds of experience, you know, there were a lot of people in town who did those kinds of things for us.
Story_ID: 56067
Speaker 1: And so when you graduated from college [University of Akron in Ohio], I mean, what, what was on your mind then to keep, continue to, to pursue teaching?.
Speaker 2: When I graduated from college I said, I am, you know, I did my student teaching at the junior high school I was a student at [Thornton High School].  And some teachers were shocked to see me back.  And some, in fact, said, we thought you weren't gonna make it.  And there was one teacher, Mrs. Whitter, (ph) in particular said, I remember you, you had a problem with spelling.  I said, "How do you remember that?"  And she said, I remember, 'cause she use to have me come in everyday at 7:30 and teach me how to spell.  And there were a lot of teachers like that who gave me an extra.  We had teachers that would drive to the house and when we were sick and give us books and give us our homework and stuff like that.  They were that much concerned about us and doing well.  And so when I went back to my junior high school to do my student teaching, some people were shocked, the other people were overjoyed.  And it's funny 'cause my mother [Florida Small], at that time, was President of PTA [Parents and Teachers Association] at a building 'cause I--my youngest brother still going to school there.  So when I graduated I said "I know what I wanna do in my life.  I gonna dedicate my life to kids, working with kids."  When I graduated, they said--and the principal at the school said "I wanna have this man in my building, he's done a great job."  During my student teaching there was a little bit of controversy, the teacher thought I did a great job, but the supervisor from the University said--gave me a "B" for Student Teaching.  And so he said, "If you have any questions to ask me," you know, and so forth.  And we had some problems at the beginning when I started my Student Teaching.  I worked full time, I work in Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.  And I taught three different subjects.  And now all the other students who are in social studies had one preparation they taught History all day.  I taught Geography, History and Urban Studies.  Three preparations and I had all the classes that the teacher had.  She said, "You could handle 'em, this is good for you."  She was right and I did all these things.  So the supervisor from the University said he wanted detailed lesson plans for each class, like ten pages on each subject for a day.  And I said, "I don't have time to do that.  My supervising teacher says my lesson plans are great and I refuse to do it."  And he said, "Well, that's gonna affect the grade" and "I said, I understand that."  But, you know, and none of the other guys had those kinds of lesson plans.  So he gave me a B and so I went him and said "Well I wanna know why you gave me a B?"  And he said, "Well you just not an A teacher.  You just don't appear to me to be an A teacher."
Speaker 1: Appear to be?
Speaker 2: Right.  And I said, well my supervising teacher said I was the best student teacher she ever had.  The building thought I was great, the principal wants me to go back and teach there.  And I said so, you know, "That's your opinion and I don't share your opinion."  Now the irony of the whole thing is I came back and became his supervisor.  He stuck around long enough for me to become his supervisor.
Speaker 1: How did he feel about that?
Speaker 2: Well he remembered that, he remembered that.
Story_ID: 56068
Speaker 1: And, so that's the kind of experience that you know--when I was determined I was going to be a teacher, and when I got out, the system said, "Well we don't have any openings in your area."  And they did hire a white female to teach social studies at that same building I was at, and the principal was--I mean, he was upset about it.  And--so, and Goodyear [Tire and Rubber Company] offered me a job at that time, a job at a supervisor in a factory.  And I said, "No.  I know what I'm gonna do, I gonna work with kids, I'm gonna dedicate my life to serving children."  And I said, "I'm not gonna take this job."  So I signed up to be a substitute teacher; and my first year in the system, in 1970, I was a substitute teacher in the system.  So don't let anybody tell anybody you can't start at the bottom and go to the top 'cause here I stand at the top of the system as superintendent.  And started out thirty some years ago as a substitute teacher.  And so I substituted; and first month, not a call; second month, not a call; third month, not a call.  So I go to a basketball game and the principal from the building said, "Where have you been?"  'Cause he used to go to basketball games.  He said, "Where have you been?"  I said, "Well I've been at home waiting for a call to substitute."  And he said, "Well, we had all these people coming at our building that handle the kids, can't handle the class."  So he told--he said, "Well come down and see me Monday."  Well it was a teacher that actually did that.  So I went down to the building and basically there was a guy that was in very--crude kind of guy, he called--he came and said, "What're doing?" and I said--so he called while I was there, he called the personnel director downtown on the phone and he literally cussed him out; and then he cussed me out said, "Now get your so-and-so downtown," and, you know.  Next thing--the next day I got a call, from that day on I got a calls; and the thing about it I would never turn down an assignment.  I would go and substitute place where people refused to go; and so after about a few months of that, they said, "You do so well and work so well with kids and people and, and get along, we're gonna offer you a job, but you have to go back to school and get certified in elementary."  And I was a secondary certified person--high school certified.  So I said, this is a test; they want me to say no I'm not gonna do it.  So I said, "No problem."  They told me that in April, by September I was certified.  That summer I went back, took those hours, took something like eighteen hours, got certified.  They put me in junior high school--never stepped foot into an elementary school until I went back to elementary school in 1990 as a principal there.  But I never taught in elementary school.
Speaker 2: They told you had to be certified for elementary and--
Speaker 1: (Nods head) Um-hm.  That's where they were going to be put me.
Speaker 2: --they never (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Never placed me there.
Speaker 2: That's interesting, you know.
Speaker 1: But I loved--substituting taught me a lot.  How to work with all kinds of kids, how to make sure that--how to make sure that you're in charge; that the kids not in charge, that there aren't any bad kids--there are some kids that are misdirected, and that you had to be in charge that the kids cannot be in charge.  That you have to been disciplined, and that you cannot fear kids.  You've got to let them know that, "Hey, certain things don't go here."  And everywhere I've gone, people will tell you there's been discipline wherever I go.  And there's been love, love and discipline.  Kids kinda feel I care about them.  And there's a special relation between me and the kids.  I've never had a problem getting along with kids.  And I have a lot of patience with kids, sometimes I don't have enough patience with adults, 'cause I think adults should know better.
Story_ID: 56069
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're saying that discipline is basically is built around love?
Speaker 2: Love.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's built around love.  If you don't--in education, if you don't have discipline you can't have learning, discipline has to precede learning.  And if you don't have that discipline, it's gets in the way of learning.  And I always tell people, "Somebody's gonna be in charge, it's either gonna be the adults or the kids, and the kids can never be in charge.  And the kids will try you, if they--kids are good at pointing out your weak spot."  They can find it and they're good at trying you 'cause they figure you're gonna get tired and then--like kids ask you over and over, "Can I, can I, can I, can I," 'cause they figure they can wear you down.  But the minute you do, you're done.  And so adults have to be in charged.  Kids know right away whether  you care about them or not, you can't hide that.  They know the people who really care about them and the people who don't.  And I have a genuine care about them, I'll go an extra mile for them, but I do believe that they have to have discipline.
Story_ID: 56070
Speaker 1: Do you have any favorite stories from when you were a school teacher?
Speaker 2: Lots of stories.  I started out--after I did my student teaching, after I finally got a job, I went to junior high on the other side of town, which was probably one of the stuffiest junior--second toughest junior high school in the city.  And I was there for 12, 13 years, loved it.  Great relationship with the kids, I got so engrossed with the kids, they got all kinds of stories about me.  I mean, I had, you know, this was in the '70's [1970], I had the big afro, you know, stuff like that.  And when I went to the high school years later, some of the parents of the--some of the kids there had parents of the students at the high school and they would find these old pictures in the yearbook and then, you know, you go in the school one day and you got these pictures of you with this big afro posted up all through the halls (laughter) and we had all kinds of stories, you know.  I did--I took care--when I was at the junior high school, took care of all the students' activities, no pay, no nothing.  I did all the activities, 'cause kids wouldn't, you know, they would come to me and say, "Well we need somebody to this, can you do this," so I would do it.  And one of my favorite stories when I-- we were having talent show, kids love to have talent shows, it was tradition.  But they couldn't get anybody to do the talent show 'cause the kids were so bad, and I said, "Yeah we'll do it."  And so I'll audition the acts, and so one guy went and told them, you know, you couldn't do certain things and so forth and kids listen to me pretty much.  And so we started the show, we started the show about 2:30, about 30 minutes before school was out.  And I told everybody, you know, I mean they must of had 1,000 kids there.  And so we started the show and I said "Now everybody's gonna have to behave, dada-dada-da," you know.  They had paid their money to go to the talent show.  And so we had this real large girl who was singing and some of the kids started booing and started calling her names and so forth like that.  And so I come on the stage, turn on the lights, you know, go on there and said, "That's it, everybody go home."  And kids, "You can't do that, we paid our money, you can't tell us."  And I said, "Listen, you may not have to go home, but you gotta get the hell out of here and get up and go now."  And when I get off this stage, everybody better be gone.  And everybody was gone (laughter).  And I'm saying, what would I have done if the 1,000 kids would have said no, but they got up and they were going.  Some of the kids, they're adults, still remember that, they remember that.  And well--he--and they know that, behave or otherwise, you know, he's gonna come and get you.  And when I went to the high school, I was a high school principal, I was an elementary principal a year and I went as a high school principal and the kids sent word via street they were gonna run me over, you know, they couldn't wait for me to get there to could run me over.  So I sent word to them, that "come on down," you know, that, you know, I'm ready for you, by the same messengers they sent to me by via the street.  But kids know that I don't have any fear of them, that I love them and what I do for them is try and help them and if you have a need, I'm gonna try and meet that need.  I don't care what--I can't tell you how many dollars I've done spent giving kids things that they need.  I've paid for babysitters, I've done paid for pampers, I've done paid for kids in their apartments, I've paid tuition for kids that were getting ready drop out of school 'cause they didn't have money, you know, found jobs for kids 'cause that's a need, that's what--that's what--I think our place you can do.  My father taught us that if you-"Any job for anything you get involved in, if you didn't make it better, you didn't do your job.  If you didn't leave the place better than what you found it, you didn't do your job."  So all my brothers and I lived by that kind of creed that, you know, you make things better, make a difference.
Story_ID: 56071
Speaker 1: So you were principal in what year?  What year did you become a principal?
Speaker 2: I was--well let me go through the scenario.  I've been--I was a junior high teacher, inner city and outer city for junior high, inner city.  Then I was an outer city high school teacher.  Then I was working in the Department of Attendance, Security, and Student Services.  And in that job, basically what did was I used to take kids to court for not going to school.  I did--I responded to break ins and burglaries at night.  I did security at all the football and basketball games at all events.  You broke up fights, you patrolled at night so forth like that.  After that job I was a curriculum specialist for social studies, in charge of all the social studies' teachers in the district and developed curriculum and so forth.  Then I was an assistant principal at a high school.  Then I was back down to student services to do that job, the same job, but I was a director down there.  Then I became an elementary principal, then I became the high school principal, then I became assistant superintendent in charge of curriculum instructions, then I became superintendent.  So I've sat in a lot of chairs in the district [Akron Public Schools], so a lot of experiences.
Story_ID: 56072
Speaker 1: Tell me what happen when where chosen superintendent [of Akron Public Schools].  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: It was a real struggle.  I applied for superintendent before.  I was at the high school which was the largest minority high school in town, Buchtel High School and I went there from the elementary school.  I was one year at the elementary school and in May of that first year, (unclear) and they called me in.  He was talking to all principals and he motioned to me to come up there and he said, "I'm moving you to Buchtel High School."  I said, "You can't move me.  I've got all these little guys that are depending on me.  I'm everybody's father there.  They, they--you know, they're depending on me, the staff is working together, we're doing all these great things."  He said, "But you can do great things at Buchtel.  Buchtel gonna need you, you're going to Buchtel starting next month."
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school again?
Speaker 2: Buchtel High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: B-U-C-H-T-E-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--so next month I'm at Buchtel High School and I'm going from elementary to high school.  Now all of my teaching experiences have been at junior high and high school, never taught an elementary school.  So I went to the high school, set out make a difference, had a great time.  I mean, the community supported me 1,000 per cent.  They community came together and formed the support group.  I mean, they had--we had parents who came in and patrolled and, and talked to kids.  We had ministers come in there and counselor kids.  We had--I had parents that I called my "A Team."  One guy was on disability and he would spend more hours in the building than I did.  He was there full time, every day, every time.  There was another guy that was Kenny Carr.  There was another guy by the name of Leonard Anderson, he worked the midnight shift and get off at 8:00 in the morning.  Before he would go home he would stop by the school and say, "Is there anybody you want me to go out there and get?"  And he would go, literally go out to the kids' homes and get them out of bed and drag them to school.  And I had a couple other guys and, you know, and they would go and knock on doors.  They would go out there and get kids.  We had--(unclear) (simultaneously) --
Speaker 1: --(unclear) (simultaneously) --
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--
Speaker 1: In the morning?
Speaker 2: In the morning yeah.  And the weekend they go and get kids and we had senior citizens who were in the neighborhood they would call up and say, "Are there some kids you want us to call at home, 'cause they had been out of school and so we haven't heard from their parents."  So we'd give them their names and they called.  So we had all that stuff going on for us.  And we got kids to believe in themselves and believe in the building and really work hard together.  And the kids knew that I didn't put up with any mess.  I told kids that, you know, "I love you, but you gotta have discipline."  And the kids--the first year I was there, a lot of kids left and said "This is too much for me.  This is like a Catholic school.  You can't do this, you can't do that."  I told them "education is serious, we're not here to have parties and dances and all that, we're here to learn."  But I told them, "You can go somewhere, but nobody's gonna love you and treat you like I treat you."  Those kids came back, a lot of them came back the following year.
Story_ID: 56073
Speaker 1: Let's finish the story of how you became superintendent [of Akron Public Schools].
Speaker 2: Okay I was a high school principal [at Buchtel High School] and there were changing superintendents and since I've been around the system for so long and knew so many people, and a tremendously number of people, I had them in school and their kids in school or somebody I know.  And African Americans never had the opportunity to be a superintendent in Akron [Ohio], I'm the first.  And so people came at me and said "You need to apply for superintendent, you need to, you know."  Well I said "No, I like this school, I'm doing great, the kids are doing great, I'm making a difference in the kids' lives, the kids are attached to me, we're attached to each other."  So I said no.  But the kids were the ones who told me to apply for superintendent.  They said "If you believe all that stuff you're telling us about being a role model and what you're doing and so forth," they said "you'll apply for superintendent.  We don't want you to go, we want you to stay with us, you know, 'cause you're good for us, but you can gonna affect a lot more kids by being superintendent.  It will really make difference."
Speaker 1: So the kids actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The kids--my best, my best advice I learned from my parents [Florida Small and Walter Small] have been from children.  And they said, "You know, you don't know which one of us you're gonna inspire by, you know, by being superintendent or just applying."  And they said to me, "When has an African American been able to apply for superintendent and being considered serious?"  And they said, "So, you know, this is something you can to do."  So I applied for superintendent.  And got down to the, you know, in the interview and so forth and so on and so forth.  And and the Board they didn't keep me in the five finalist and what they did at that particular point, they brought back a retired deputy superintendent, superintendent and he brought me downtown as the assistant superintendent.  And then when he retired, I was assistant super--his assistant for seven years.  And so the path was clear to me, I'm gonna apply for superintendent, you know, you know.  And one of the things that, and I keep this on my desk, where a student--students would always giving me their graduation pictures.  This one young lady gave me this picture and on the back of it she wrote, "Dear Dr. Small, thank you for stopping by in my life at Buchtel High School and playing a positive role in my life."  And she said, "isn't God great, one who make a way out of no way.  Just remember, if you get too big for small things, you'll be too small for big things."  And this is this high school student telling me, don't get big-headed, keep things in perspective, you know, and that's one of the greatest piece of advice I've ever gotten.  And this is from a high school student.  So I've always kept that in mind, you know, and so I said, you know, nothing a slam dunk.  I've got all the experience, been in all the chairs so I'll said I'm gonna apply for superintendent, so I applied.  Also applying was a person who was supervising the high school principals who worked directly under me.  And that person applied, a white female.  And then there were some people outside the district that applied and that got to be a pretty knotty ugly kind of contest.  And got down to the point--there were three finalists, me, the person who was white female who worked in the district with me and a person who was a retired Air Force guy that had no educational background that had been a superintendent out in Colorado for year or two years or something like that.  So it had a national search for superintendent, so-
Story_ID: 56074
Speaker 1: We got down to the point where it was just the two of us.  And the Board was going back and forth and the community getting upset and basically the community got--they were having a Saturday Board meeting and in the meantime, one African American female who had been a long serving Board member passed away.  And they appointed another African American intern to take her place, and-a male.  So it got down to the point where they, they interviewed us once, they interviewed us twice and then the head community, a small forum invited about 100 people in the community and made, we made--put them in small group and we made presentation to them.  And then we also made a presentation to the Mayor [Donald L. Plusquellic] and Members of the Chamber of Congress.  And-- so the Board was getting down from the point where they were ready to make a decision and the African American community got wind that the Board was going to be voting that Saturday and that the other person had four votes, seven Board members.  So the African American community showed up Saturday morning, I mean, 100 of people waiting to see what was going on.  And they--at the same time they were faxing 'em and calling 'em, I mean, everything.  And they, they didn't take a vote and during that weekend and they decided well let's do a dual thing.  Let's make you superintendent and her a deputy superintendent.  Can you guys work together?  And we've always worked together 'cause we both care about the district.  So we said yeah, we can do that.  So that Monday it was so many African Americans at the Board meeting.  The whole boardroom was full, they had to set up a bunch of chairs outside in the hallway and the folks said, we'll not leaving here until this is done.  And everybody was basically saying, this man has got the credentials, he's got the background, he's at a Ph.D., he's the only candidate that has these credentials, so why is there an issue?  And so the Board members basically went out, they came back in, and I mean, it must have been 8:00 at night, but the people was still there, still there waiting.  And then they announced--one Board member who was a former (unclear) for a number of years, he left and he wouldn't vote for me, he refused, you know, he left, he didn't vote either way.  He just left, wasn't there, when they voted to make me superintendent and the other person deputy superintendent, us both together as a team.  And so, and so the community, really, if it wasn't for the community and the prayers from the people out there, you know, so that's how I got here.
Speaker 2: Was there any particular person in the community that organized this effort?
Speaker 1: People, people who didn't even like me pulled together for me.  And it wasn't just African Americans, it was whites and so forth that was backing me and pulling for me and saying, "Yeah you're the person for the job."  I would--give you an example, a old--a lady called she was eighty-nine years old and the newspaper had all these articles, if you pull the "Beacon Journal" articles, go on the web, you can pull up all the articles 'cause all this stuff.  This lady out of the blue called me and said, "You don't know me," and she would call and she wouldn't leave a message, she just leave her name, wouldn't leave a telephone number and then finally she caught me while I was in the office and she said, "You don't know me, but my name is such-and-such and she said, I'm from Germany, I came over to this country many, many years ago and a retired professor from the University of Akron and I'm following the stuff in the paper" and she said, "you have beautiful credentials, you deserve this job.  And I thought it was important for me to call you and tell you that."  And so the whole community kinda came together and said, this don't make any--'cause they published everybody's credentials in there, and my credentials were impeccable.  I mean, all the certification, doctor's degree, all those chairs I'd sat in, all the years' experience, things I've done.  There was no place that I had been that I was not a success 'cause the phrase my father [Walter Small] said, "Make it better than what you found it."  So with the people working with them, that's what happened.  So that's how I got to be superintendent.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean, all the churches, and ministers, everybody, I mean, it was the congregations was out there and right off the bat when I came on board, big deficient.  So we cut $4 million dollars out of the budget and proposed a levy within, you know, two months on the job, we put a levy on the ballot.  And 8.9 million, which is a big levy and it passed, but the largest we had a levy pass, operating levy pass about 56 percent.  And it was due to the community.  The churches and the ministers and the community, I mean, they just came out, you know, said we gotta support him.  And they still doing it, you know.

Speaker 1: What are the biggest problems confronted in Akron's [Ohio] school system right now--that you're working on, trying to (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it's the academic achievement, it's closing the achievement gap between African Americans and non-minorities; it's resources, financial resources.  We're an urban district and we're having a decline in enrollments, decline in resources, the problems that you have with students, retaining good people, a lack of African Americans in the profession.  A lot of them are my age and older, and they're retiring and there're not people to take their place.  It's a myriad--and it's a political system, a very political atmosphere with community schools and charter schools.  So I, going in I shared my philosophy with everybody.  My philosophy is that my goal is to turn the Akron Public Schools into a world class, student focused, community based learning system.  'Cause education is more than just the school system.  It's the whole community; that everybody has to participate in education; that the kids are important, we have to focus on them and their needs.  So my goal is to do that.  And I have to make a lot of ugly decisions that gonna affect a lot of people, but I have to put the kids first; I've always put them first.
Speaker 1: Give me an example of an ugly decision you might have made?
Speaker 2: Well I just moved sixteen principals and about fourteen assistant principals; and what I'm saying to people is that I made a commitment to make a difference and in order to make a difference, I need everybody at the top of their game.  And we're gonna move you, and aligned you where you gonna do a good job, but if you don't do a good job, then it's plan of assistance, then it's time for you to go someplace else.  I've signed a contract with the community saying I'm gonna do certain things, if I don't do these things, you know, you need to get rid of me.  I told the community: "Hold me accountable, I'm not afraid of the challenge."  If I don't do what I promised them what I'm gonna do, and we've got a contract that I signed, the president of the board of education signed, the mayor signed and president of city council, that's saying I'm gonna do these things, and if I don't do them, you can get rid of me.  'Cause my father [Walter Small] told me: "You gotta be committed to make a difference.  Don't' be afraid to make the commitment."
Speaker 1: I think there're over sixty schools in the (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixty school (unclear), right; and about thirty thousand students.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  The population of Akron [Ohio] is roughly?
Speaker 2: Probably about 220, thirty [230] thousand people.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 56076
Speaker 1: What particular needs does--do the--does the African American community have that you, that you (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well they wanna see their kids like everybody else, be successful and achieve.  And all over the country African Americans students for some reason are not achieving.  And what it is, is that everybody gets the idea that kids show up at kindergarten ready to learn and at thirteen years later, we all walk across the stage and get our diploma.  But a lot of kids start behind that line and that when that group of kids start show up at kindergarten, the kids who  can read at the first grade level, second grade level, the kids that know a lot, but there are also kids who show up and don't know their name, their real name.  They, they know "Pookie" or something like that, but they don't know their real name.  That there's absolutely no reading materials in their house, they've never seen book, a newspaper, a magazine and they're in that same classroom and so they're starting behind that line.  And yet we have to--we have to kinda catch them up, so that's one of the greatest challenge.  I think a school system only has one challenge and that challenge is to make sure that every child achieve an acceptable potential, the highest potential, that's the only thing we have to do, is make sure that every child, and I'm talking about every child, I don't care what it is, it's our job to make sure that that child reaches an educational level that when they get out of school, that they had the tools to be successful, no matter what they wanna do.

Speaker 1: [You've been superintendent for fourteen months. What kind of legacy would you like to leave when this is over?]
Speaker 2: Okay, the legacy I like to leave is the same thing my father [Walter Small] taught us is that "It's not about the glory, it's not about the power, it's not about how much money you make, it's about that you make a difference, a positive difference in life."  My mother [Florida Small] and father taught us that you have to make a positive difference.  And that positive difference will be said by other people, not by you.  You don't brag on yourself, you don't set yourself apart from other people, you don't forget where you came from, but just that you make a positive difference in somebody's life, that you helped somebody.  And that's what I hope I leave, that I made a positive difference and I helped somebody.  And not that I'm the first African American superintendent or I made a lot of money or anything like that, but did I make a positive difference in people lives.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Your father [Walter Small] passed away a couple years ago, right?
Speaker 2: My father passed away four years ago.  We dearly miss him 'cause we're a very close-knit family.  My brothers and I, there's six just like I said before, and we're a family, a truly a family in every sense of the word.  Wherever there's a need in the family we all respond to it, money is never a an issue with us, when somebody's building the house or painting the house or anything, we all go over and do it for somebody.  So we all go and do it.  My mother's [Florida Small] still alive, we visit our mother--the ones in town visit my mother either every day or every week.  I have one brother goes over and cut the grass every week.  We do all those kinds of things.  The brothers that are out of town, they call my mother every week.  Holidays, we all go back to mom's house.
Speaker 1: So what you have, you got a successful family as well as successful individuals?
Speaker 2: Well my oldest brother is--he works Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Union City, Tennessee, been working there every since he got out of the Air Force.  My next brother, he owns his own business, he's an electrician.  And then there's me.  And then the brother right under me has a Ph.D. in Chemistry.  He lives in Cincinnati [Ohio] and works for Protector and Gamble.  And then my brother under him is a Lieutenant in the Fire Department here [Akron, Ohio].  And then my youngest brother electrician at Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.  And we believe that job is important, that you don't take a job from somebody and don't give them an honest day's work for the dollars you're making.  So we don't believe in not doing our job, we don't believe in not going to work.  We don't even take off work when we're sick 'cause that's what my father used to do.  We--our father never missed a day of work in his life.  And I mean he worked overtime all the time.  When he left Goodyear, they shut down the whole mill line and bronzed his mill hook.  And he had a hard, dirty job.  He was a batch man in the dirtiest part of the factory where the batch rubbed together for the tires and so forth.  And they'd tell all kinds of legendary stories about him about how hard he worked and what he did.  He instilled that work ethic in us that you know, so we can work long hours and not even bother us.
Speaker 1: So you got quite a model to live up to?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, we do it.  And we believe that parents are important.  Our greatest treasures are our parents.  So honor them we, we make sure--they took care of us and sacrificed for us so--we take them where they want to go, we provide them with things, we do everything for them, because we like what they've done for us.  We know--we respect what they've done for us.

Speaker 1: You said earlier that your father [Walter Small] always taught you not look just at your shoes and your feet, but look ahead, plan ahead, plan the next step.  Well, what do you, what do you see for yourself in the, in the not too distinct, but, but further future?
Speaker 2: Well I see myself being the superintendent until they kick me out the door working for kids and when they kick me out the door, I'm gonna work with kids on the outside.  I think--I've been lucky enough to find not a job but a calling.  And it's a difference between a job and calling.  And a few people find their calling.  So I'm suited in--I think God ordained me to be what I am, to work with kids.  Not a superintendent, but to work with kids.  It's not important what the title is, it's the kind of work you do.  So I'm lucky in that respect that God kinda guided me along that path.  So I see myself doing that and touching people and working with kids and making a difference and instilling that in other people.  I work with a lot of young administrators that, that I have to give that gift to.  So I want to be able to pass it to somebody else so they can pass it to someone else.  So I've got a lot of challenges ahead of me.  I don't--my father taught all of us, "Don't worry, don't take stuff personal, the best thing to do--worrying never solves anything" he said.  He said, "If you-- if you did all the worrying in the world, it's still not gonna solve the problem.  But if you're gonna solve a problem, you're gonna solve it so go ahead and solve it and don't worry about it."  So we don't take on that stress about worrying about stuff 'cause he taught us not to do that.  He taught us to go out there and do your best and when you've done your best and you look in that mirror and you're satisfied and you can honestly say to yourself, I did my best, that's all that's important.  Nothing else counts.
Speaker 1: Thank you sir and good luck.
