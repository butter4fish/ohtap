Story_ID: 296148
Speaker 1: I'd like to ask you about your family history now.  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [James Moody, Sr.] side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side, though.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother's name is Rosetta Ella Hall Moody; R-O-S-E-T-T-A, Ella, E-L-L-A, Hall, H-A-L-L, Moody.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 3, 1892, Woodville, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace your ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Well, with my mother, I can--my grandfather [Wesley Hall], I didn't know him, but I have pictures of him.  He was a minister, an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister.  My grandmother [Laura Turner], the only thing I can remember about her is going to her funeral when I was about four or five years old.  I had a great aunt, my grandmother's sister I knew who used to come and visit with us and stay with us in Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  In fact, she stayed the last few years of her life with us there in Baton Rouge.  My mother's brothers, both of them I knew very well.  Wesley Simon Hall who was an A.M.E. minister.  But before that, he was a cook on the railroad.  And my uncle Horace G. Hall, or H.G. Hall, as was he was known, was the vice president of the Chicago Metropolitan Mutual Assurance Company [Chicago, Illinois], and one of the founding members of the [Illinois] Service Federal Savings and Loan [Chicago, Illinois], and the founder of the Chicago--well actually the African American American League, the Negro American League, and the old Negro Baseball League.  And he was the manager of the Chicago American Giants.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that's quite a history. Now so, well, before I get into some of these other relatives, are there any stories about the days of slavery or the Civil War, or Reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: Well, my great aunt used to tell us when she came to visit about things she did on somebody's plantation and things.  But she was not a slave.  I mean she was just recently--probably after slavery--but she would talk about that.  And my grandfather lost one arm in a sawmill accident.  So, that's about the closest thing that I can firsthand talk about that my great aunt used to talk about. And we used to love--in fact when she came, if she had a headache, she'd put a little salt in her head.  I don't know, I guess that was supposed to stop the headache or something.  But we used to love to lay and sleep with her and talk with her, and she would entertain us when we were kids.
Speaker 1: Did she have any good stories for you when you were--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she had some good stories.  I can't remember them now, that's been sixty-something years ago.  But she used to talk about, she'd talk about Mr. So-and-So's plant--place, you know, they would call it, doing this and their work.
Story_ID: 296149
Speaker 1: And my uncle [Wesley Simon Hall] would talk about his days on the railroad and his exploits.  My Uncle Horace [H.G. Hall] always loved baseball.  In fact, I can remember when he was old and had retired, he would still sit and watch TV and keep the box scores of the games.  Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: So, your Uncle Horace, now, he moved from Woodville [Mississippi] to--
Speaker 1: No, well--
Speaker 2: --Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Well, they lived in New Orleans [Louisiana] for a while, and then he moved to Chicago.  In fact, my mother [Rosetta Hall Moody] and my father [James Moody, Sr.] graduated from old New Orleans University, which merged with Straight University to form Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana].  And I have seen pictures of them when they were in college and my mother playing croquet, and things of that nature.  And one of my mother and father's good friends was Mr. Yancy, who was--I don't know if you read the little book, 'The Little Professor of Piney Wood[s],' [Beth Day] about the--well, Yancy is one of the guys that went to school and helped build a lot of buildings.  He was a carpenter, and he was a good friend of my mom and my dad.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, are there any other stories about your uncle?  Now Horace--
Speaker 1: Horace--
Speaker 2: Horace Hall was involved in the insurance--he had an insurance company?
Speaker 1: Well, he was the vice president.  But [Robert A.] Cole, I can't remember Mr. Cole's first name.  But Mr. Cole started the Chicago Metropolitan Mutual Assurance Company [Chicago, Illinois].  And they had a, he had a funeral home right next door to it on what used to be South Parkway, but it's now [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] Drive at 45th Street, 46th Street, 4545 South Park.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's some history.  Did you ever get a chance to see any of the Negro League games?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I went, my wife [Christella Moody] and I went to the All-Star Game.  They used to have the All-Star baseball game there in Chicago at Comiskey Park, and we went to that.  I got a chance to see some of them.
Speaker 2: Now, so your mother went to New Orleans University?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, did she, did she talk about life in Mississippi or in New Orleans when she was growing up?
Speaker 1: Well, not a, not a, not a whole lot.  I mean she didn't talk about it a lot, but she talked about it.  And from the conversation, she had a good time.  She enjoyed college; she enjoyed going to school there.
Story_ID: 296150
Speaker 1: My dad came to the United States when he was seventeen years old from Belize [British Honduras].  He didn't know anybody, and didn't have any relatives, friends.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 1: James Nathaniel Moody [Sr.].
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what's his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: May 5, 1884.
Speaker 2: And he was born in?
Speaker 1: Belize, British Honduras.  It's now Belize City, in Belize now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Belize City, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, what do you know about his ancestors?
Speaker 1: Not very much, because my dad didn't really talk about it.  But I had a brother, George [Moody], who wrote to the police department in Belize.  And I think the police chief was my daddy's brother.  My dad had a number of brothers, and one of them, well, his mother [Mary Moody Bennett] remarried, and so she had, she married a Bennett.  And so, this brother was Charles Bennett, and he lived in Belize.  In fact, he sent a picture to us in his uniform.  And in fact, we have it in a book of mine.  My son went back to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] to speak at a program for my sister, that they were having for my sister.  And he sent us some of the pictures that my Uncle Charles--my Uncle Charles lived in Los Angeles [California].  He moved to Los Angeles with his son, and he passed a few years back.  But I don't really know much about my dad's people.  But my son and I, and my wife [Christella Moody] and his wife, we're going to go to Belize.  I want to go, because nobody in my family has ever been to Belize.  And my daddy never went back.
Speaker 2: So, did he, did he talk about growing up?  How did he grow up?  What do you know about his growing up?
Speaker 1: I really don't know anything.  I remember him saying something about a family there that either he worked for or knew, named Haylock [ph.].  But I don't know anything.  But I've run into--an interesting thing--when I was stationed in the [U.S. military] service in Panama, my wife and I, my wife was speaking at a church down there in Colon [Panama]. And they had--you know how they list your name in the program.  And they had the speaker, Mrs. Charles David Moody.  And one of the people said, "Oh, I know a Charles D. Moody.  He lives right around the corner from the church."  And they went and got him, and I met him.  And then just about a year and a half ago at my church here, I was talking to somebody about Belize.  And the lady behind me said, "I'm from Belize."  And I said, "Oh, you are?"  She said, "Yes."  I said, "Well, my father was born in Belize."  And she said, "What is your name, sir?"  I said, "My name is Charles Moody [HistoryMaker Charles D. Moody, Sr.]."  She said, "Oh, my best friend growing up was named Moody.  And when I go home, I'm going to call her."  And I gave her one of my cards, and the young lady called me, and we talked and we corresponded by e-mail.  And she gave me an aunt's name, and so I talked to her, this aunt.  But in the meantime, when I was talking to the young lady, her name is Moody, I told her, I said, "Well, I met a Charles Moody in Panama."  She said, "That's my uncle.  He was in Colon, and he came back when his mother got sick, and now he's living somewhere in Ohio."  Now, I did meet one of my daddy's nieces, Bernice [ph.].  And she was working in New York in one of the wealthy suburbs.  And my wife and I drove up to see her.  And she's been to visit my sister, Mary [Moody], down in Baton Rouge.  But my sister knew, knows more about that than I, because she's talked with a lot of people.  But I've enjoyed talking to this cousin.  Now, we've decided we're cousins.  I don't think there's that many Moodys in Belize.  But her aunt's brothers had the same name as my daddy's.  Her brother's aunt's, her father's brother, was the same name as my daddy's brothers.  So--
Speaker 2: There may be something to it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, yeah, in fact, someone was saying--this cousin that I met by phone was saying that Marion Jones, the track girl's mother, was from Belize, and her name was Moody, maiden name was Moody.
Story_ID: 296151
Speaker 1: When did your father [James Moody, Sr.] come to the United States?
Speaker 2: When he was seventeen.  So, that would have been what, 1901?  He came here in 1901.  And he, I mean my understanding is they put him almost down in the grade school at seventeen.  But he finished college, I think when he was maybe thirty, thirty-two, but he finished.  And he went on to teach, and he became what they call a Jeanes Supervisor.  Do you know about the Jeanes Supervisors?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Jean Supervisors, right.  Well, tell the, tell the listeners about this.
Speaker 2: Well, the Jeanes Supervisor was a program started by a million dollar donation by a Quaker woman, Anna T. Jeanes, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And she gave this money in an endowment [Anna T. Jeanes Foundation] to help rural southern black schools.  And they started with Jeanes Teachers, and then they had what they called Jeanes Supervisors.  And my take on that is that the Jeanes Supervisors were really the predecessors to today's black superintendents, because they were responsible for all of the education operations for black schools.  Now, there was a superintendent, who was white.  But I can remember my daddy--we lived in East Baton Rouge Parish [Louisiana], but my daddy was the Jeanes Supervisor of schools in West Baton Rouge Parish [Louisiana], which was across the Mississippi River.  And I remember going to his May Days and different things.  And my older brothers and their friends would referee and help run some of the May Day field day programs and stuff.  And it was a very interesting thing.  And I'm very keen on the inequalities and inequities in education for blacks.  Because I used to go sometimes with my father across the river, we called it.  And we'd pass this big beautiful white--and I mean white in color--high school for white kids.  And there was no high school in West Baton Rouge for black kids.  So, if a black kid finished elementary school, they would have to go down to the Mississippi River and get on the ferry and ride across on the ferry and catch public transportation in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] to go to the one black high school that was in East Baton Rouge Parish.  So, when I was working--for my first seventeen years at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], I ran the Desegregation Assistance Center, working with school districts.  And people used to talk about they didn't believe in cross-district bussing.  And I said, "Well, I know that's very interesting that you didn't believe in it when we were trying to equalize our opportunities and desegregate schools.  But it was all right when you were, it was fostering segregation, and black kids had to walk down through the Mississippi River to get on a rickety ferry and go across the Mississippi River and catch a public bus to go to high school.  Now, that's cross-district.  That's cross, that's cross-county, parish lines, as we call the counties in Louisiana."  And so, but I know my third oldest brother--well, all four of my older brothers were drafted in the Second World War [WWII], and fought in the Second World War.
Story_ID: 296152
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do, do you have altogether?
Speaker 2: I have--it was--it's six boys and two girls.  I have two sisters and I have five brothers.  And the four older brothers served in World War II [WWII].  In fact, my oldest brother, Albert [Moody], was drafted before Pearl Harbor.  And my second oldest brother [Horace Moody] played two years of football at Southern [University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], and he was drafted.  And my third oldest brother [James Moody, Jr.] finished Southern, and he was drafted.  And he came back after he got out.  I mean, he was a captain; he went from private to captain in four years, three or four years, whatever the amount of time he was in the [U.S.] Army.  And my daddy [James Moody, Sr.] hired him to be the principal of the school.  And he was the one that made them get electricity in the elementary school in Port Allen [Louisiana].  I mean I was telling somebody just yesterday, if it clouded up when I was kid going to school, and got dark--you know how it gets--we couldn't have school, because there was no electricity in the building, even in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] in elementary school.  So, I'm pretty keen on that.  And I guess, I would say it was six--it was six boys and two girls.  So, there was eight kids.  In 1935, my parents had eight kids in school.  Because my oldest brother, Albert, started his senior year at Southern.  And I started first grade at Scott Street [Elementary] School [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And so--
Speaker 1: Let me backtrack a little bit to your father again.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, your father finished at New Orleans University [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he was a Jeanes Supervisor?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He retired as a Jeanes Supervisor the year I went to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1951--'50 [1950], he retired.
Story_ID: 296153
Speaker 1: Do you have a first childhood memory, an earliest memory from childhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, wanting to follow my oldest brother [Albert Moody] wherever he went.  And yeah--and on Easter going out--my daddy [James Moody, Sr.] loved to garden.  He had grew beautiful roses and sweet peas and--flower sweet peas.  And we'd get our little white suits for Easter and put our flower on.  But each one of us had a responsibility.  Like my older brother had a job, and my second oldest brother [Horace Moody] was the disciplinarian for the younger kids.  And my third oldest brother [James Moody] was a gardener, I mean he kept the yard up and the hedges--and he cooked all the cakes and the pies and stuff for Christmas, and things like that.
Story_ID: 296154
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, my dad [James Moody, Sr.] and momma [Rosetta Hall Moody] getting up early and making coffee, and drinking coffee and sitting around talking and laughing with each other.  And my mother going to church and class, and letting me collect class dues, you know, when I was a young kid.
Speaker 1: Did you all attend the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Bethel.
Speaker 1: Bethel A.M.E. Church [Baton Rouge, Louisiana], okay.
Speaker 2: Bethel A.M.E. Church.  In fact, my sister [Mary Moody] now is, she retired as an A.M.E. minister.  And she's the associate pastor or something at Bethel now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other sights and sounds and smells of--?
Speaker 2: Just -- Yeah, I guess seeing my daddy walking home with his briefcase.  And having lemon drops that he used to give us, or peppermint candy.
Story_ID: 296155
Speaker 1: How would you describe your neighborhood?  Was it an all-black neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was interesting.  It was, I lived on Evergreen Drive, two blocks.  And Evergreen Drive ran between North Boulevard and Government Street, which was a four block area, okay.  The one hundred and the two hundred block of Evergreen Drive was all black.  There were no sidewalks, and for a number of years, there was no paved streets.  But they paved the streets, but the three hundred and four hundred block of Evergreen Drive was white. They had sidewalks.  And, well, how can I say it?  I had friends who lived as the only blacks on a block.  You didn't have that phenomena that I saw when I came to Chicago [Illinois], white flight, where you could see the neighborhood changing when one black person--I mean those folks lived there for years and were the only blacks on that particular street.  And so, housing segregation wasn't as strict, because they built houses behind the houses, and there were whites that lived there.  And it was a strange phenomenon.  I had, white kids, we even played ball with, did different things with.  But you didn't go to church with them, you didn't go to school with them, you didn't go the movies with them, but you could play in the neighborhood.  And I mean I guess we were schizophrenic because I'm (laughter)--.
Speaker 1: So, did a lot of the black people live near white folks that they worked for?  Is that how it was?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, it's--because my neighborhood was very interesting.  In fact, it was a very close-knit neighborhood.  And a lot of the black men who lived in our neighborhood worked for Standard Oil [Company].  And I used to hear them talk about what shift they were going to work.  They were working the dog, which meant they worked from midnight to eight in the morning, or eleven [P.M.] to seven [A.M.].  And it's, it's interesting.  Those guys made much more money doing that than my father [James Moody, Sr.] did as a Jeanes Supervisor.  But those folks were very supportive of my mother [Rosetta Hall Moody] and father and us, and they were just as proud of our achievements as if we were their children.  And if my mother and father, my mother in particular, needed something to pay the tuition, they would lend it to her.  And when my brothers and sisters and I or somebody did something, they walked around with their chest out just as proud as if it was some--one of their kids, and it was good.
Story_ID: 296156
Speaker 1: Sir, what grade school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to, I started off at Scott Street Elementary School [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And then when I got in the, going to the fourth grade, I transferred to Perkins Road Elementary School in Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  And you know, the irony of that is I passed a couple of white elementary schools in my neighborhood to get to the black elementary school.  In fact, one of the elementary schools that I passed, my sister--some sixty years later, was working with that desegreg- thing in Baton Rouge--Dufrocq School--so you'll have to talk to her about it, she knows about the history--they're making it some--I mean they're doing some big project.  But I used to could stand on my back porch and see Baton Rouge High [School; Baton Rouge Magnet High School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], the white high school.  But I had to go, for eighth grade I had to go all the way over to McKinley [Senior] High School.  And then I, in ninth grade I transferred to Southern University Lab School [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], where I graduated from.  But I started off with Perkins the first few three--they didn't have kindergarten when I started school.  In fact I never, I never graduated from elementary school.  You got something on your form that asked what--when I graduated from elementary--I never graduated from elementary school.  I'm the only Moody who had never graduated from elementary school (laughter).
Speaker 1: In the family, yeah.
Speaker 2: Because--but see, what happened--it used to be a seven four system, from first through seventh grade, then you graduated from eleventh grade.  Well, when I got to seventh grade, they added the twelfth grade, which meant I didn't graduate from seventh grade like the kids now that go to the eighth grade; I had to go to eighth grade.  And then we didn't graduate from eighth grade, so I just got promoted to ninth grade.  But when I was superintendent of schools in Harvey, Illinois, they gave me a certificate from one of my elementary schools because they knew I had never graduated from elementary school.
Story_ID: 296157
Speaker 1: Well, how would you describe yourself as a school kid going to school?  What kind of a kid were you? Which--what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I'll tell you what kind of kid I was, and I'll tell you why.  Because the first day I walked in school, the teacher wanted to know if I was as smart as the other Moody boys and girls.  And I told her, "I don't know, but I'm going to give you more trouble than any of them ever gave you."  So, I (laughter) I was a, I was, I mean I got into--I just didn't take any--maybe I was defensive because I was the smallest of all of them.  When I was in high school [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], I--the kids in high school and college could go to the same--could go on campus and get the food.  And I remember hearing some of the guys saying, "That's Little Moody."  And one of the boys looked at me and said, "He must be in about sixth grade."  Well, I was in ninth grade then, you know.  So I mean, I had a good childhood.  I mean I had fun, I played ball.  I got pictures in that book with me out in the street playing ball.  I played football on the high school team, and my senior year we went eleven and 'oh.
Story_ID: 296158
Speaker 1: I had a good childhood. I mean, I guess I grew out of the fact that--because my mother [Rosetta Hall Moody] never compared us.  Her thing was, "I'm going to love you like you need it."  So, she didn't try to treat us equally.  She didn't try to treat everybody the same.  She treated us the way we needed, and I guess that's where I got my concept of equity.  You know, you don't treat people in schools the same.  If you treat people unequally, then you can't say, "Well, now, all right, we're going to treat everybody same.  We're going to give everybody the same amount of money."  If you have deprived me of funds, then you've got to give me more funds so I can catch up.  It's just the analogy I use as--years ago when they used to run the 440 [yard]--the 440's like the 400 meter, they used to line all the runners up across the starting line, right across, right.  Somebody in their wisdom found out that the person on the outside lane was running a greater distance than the person on the inside lane, so they started staggering them.  Now, to the untrained eye, it looks as if that person on the outside lane has an unfair advantage.  So, you've got some reverse discrimination, huh?  But all you're trying to do is make sure that everybody runs the same distance.  And so, that's--you know I mean--so I mean I got that from my mother.  She didn't try to, she never compared us.  For each--we had our strengths, we had our weaknesses, we needed our stroking, and we needed a tough hand sometimes.  But she gave it to us as we needed.
Speaker 2: You were the youngest brother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm the youngest kid.
Speaker 2: Okay, youngest kid, okay.  Out of seven?
Speaker 1: Out of eight.
Speaker 2: Eight. Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm the youngest.
Story_ID: 296159
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And your brothers were successful athletes and stu--
Speaker 1: Yeah, when--see, my oldest brother, Albert [Moody], finished college in 1939.  And he was drafted.  He became a commissioned officer in the old Coast Artillery [U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps] during the Second World War [World War II, WWII].  He retired, he stayed in the [Coast Artillery] Reserves.  I think he retired as a colonel or something, but he retired as a high school principal; he was a math teacher.  His first job was as an assistant dean of boys at Southern [University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  Then he went up to Shreveport [Louisiana] where his wife was from, and started teaching mathematics.  And so, and then my second oldest brother Horace [Moody]--now my oldest brother is Albert.  My second oldest brother, Horace, was a football player at Southern.  In fact, he's in the Southwest Athletic Conference Hall of Fame, and so is his son, Horace [Moody], Jr.  And he was a non-commissioned officer during the Second World War, and he was in the old [U.S. Army] Transportation Corps.  He drove the supply trucks over in Europe.  Third oldest bro--my third oldest brother, James [Moody], who retired as an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister, was drafted into the [U.S.] Army in 1942.  And he went from private to captain in his tenure in the Army.  But he made the highest test score of any recruit coming through Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, and had a perfect 150 on the mechanical aptitude test.  He wanted to be a pilot.  He designed and built air--model airplanes ever since he was a kid.  But you know, they couldn't get him on the test scores, so they said he was too tall, he was 6'4"; he was too big, 232 [pounds].  So, you know, my mother [Rosetta Hall Moody] and I, we always said, "I don't want you to lower the standards for me, but don't raise no standards on me.  Or don't change and move the door."  I mean, so, I mean, they couldn't say, "Well, you can't do that because, you know, your test scores are not--," he had the test scores, he was a college graduate.  He had been dealing in model--in fact he won a contest for his model airplanes, and it was tickets to a movie in Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  But he couldn't go; they wouldn't--you know, he couldn't go, they didn't give him the damn prize.  My brother, Joe [Joseph Moody], I remember I must have been in about second grade [at Scott Street Elementary School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], and he was in high school.  And everybody around the school used to talk about he made a perfect one hundred average, he got one hundred in everything.  And he went his first two years to Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  And he got drafted, and he was in the Quartermasters [Quartermaster Corps] in Europe.  He was a sergeant when he got out.  And, and Horace, the third oldest brother, was a sergeant.

Speaker 1: But now the interesting thing is my dad [James Moody, Sr.], as a Jeanes Supervisor, they used to go to all of these workshops in the summertime for the Jeanes Supervisors--places like Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and different places.  And my brother [Joseph Moody] was at Hampton, and my daddy went there for one of those summer workshops.  And he got a chance to talk with him and be with him while he was there.  But then he got, my brother got drafted, and he went to Europe.  My brother next to me, he was a, he was a musician so he went into the [U.S.] Air Force Band.  And I've got pictures of him playing--
Speaker 2: What's his name?
Speaker 1: George [Moody].
Speaker 2: George.  Okay, so he was in the Army Air Corp Band?
Speaker 1: Air Force, it was the Air Force Band.  Because he was--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was later.
Speaker 1: That was later.  He, he's four years--he would have been--he's four years older than me, see.  And he was a photographer.  The guy was, he was really a brilliant guy, I mean, he really was.  He used to play with Otis Redding; he played with Otis Redding.  And then my oldest sister--
Speaker 2: What did he play, I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: He played tenor sax.  Well, he could play any instrument almost you gave him, but his primary instrument was tenor sax.  And my sister, Mary [Moody]--one of the music teachers, Willis Patterson, who, he said--and we all thought she had one of the most beautiful voices you ever wanted to hear.  And she, but she, she taught at the school for the blind for a number of years, and then she retired from that and became a full-time A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister.  And she's retired from that now, because she's seventy-eight years old.  And my sister, Martha [Moody], was really an outstanding student.  She's two years older than me, she's seventy-four; yeah, she's seventy-four.  And she retired as an assistant principal up in Shreveport [Louisiana].  And she lives here.  And my brother, they live up in, well, right outside of Shreveport in Keithville, Louisiana.  So, eight kids, and all of us have at least--seven have what you would call master's degrees, but all of us have worked beyond the bachelor's [degree], all eight of us.
Speaker 2: Oh, that is a legacy to live up to.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  In fact, I used to say there was nothing--the first thing that I did that none of my brothers or sisters had done, was in 1971 I got my Ph.D.  Because when I graduated from college [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], they all had graduated from college.  When I, when I, got my commission in the [U.S.] Army, two of them already had commissions in the Army.  So, that was, that was the first thing that I did that none of my brothers or sisters had done before me.
Story_ID: 296161
Speaker 1: Now you had all these brothers and sisters as role models.  But were there any teachers that stood out?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh yeah.  I had some, I had some--my, my--I give credit to my sister-in-law.  She was not my, she was never formally my teacher, but she taught me how to spell and to read.  See, when my brother got married and went to the [U.S. military] service, she came and lived with us.  And she used to teach across the river.  And she taught me how to spell and.
Speaker 1: Now, what is her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Estella [Martin Moody].
Speaker 1: Estella?
Speaker 2: Estella, E-S-T-E-L-L-A.
Speaker 1: She was married to which brother?
Speaker 2: My brother Albert [Moody], my oldest brother.  And she taught me how to read and spell.  Because every time I'd spell a word right, she'd let me kiss her on the cheek, and she'd kiss me.  So, man, I was spelling like a champion.  I kid her about that all the time now, yeah.  She, she, she was good to me.  She taught me how to spell.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I had some teachers, some former teachers, like Miss Kennedy [ph.] and Miss Mott.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that one?
Speaker 2: M-O-T-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Williams was my high school [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]--one of my high school teachers, English teachers. Now I--Mrs. Curry. I mean, I had some good teachers.  I mean, they understood that I was who I was, and who I was going to be.  And I just didn't take a lot of foolishness from folks and I still don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 296162
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a story about where somebody tried to give you some foolishness that you didn't (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'll give you one.  In eighth grade [at McKinley Senior High School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], we were--you know, we had to clean up, sweep the room.  I mean, you guys up north didn't have to do that, but we had to clean.  So, there were three assigned, three boys assigned; it was our day to clean the room.  So, I cleaned my third of the room.  The other two guys went on and played basketball.  So, I did my third.  I wasn't going to clean the whole room for them.  So, I did my third and went on home.  I come back the next morning to school, and everybody is outside the room; it was like a detached building from the high school.  And I said, "What's going on?"  These guys had got to school and told the teacher that I didn't clean, I wouldn't clean the room.  So, she's going to send me to the principal.  I said, okay.  And so, the principal came and said, "You're going to clean this whole high school."  I mean, it was a big high school.  I said, "No, I'm not."  I said, "I'm not."  I said, "Baton Rouge High [School; Baton Rouge Magnet High School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] got janitors.  You better get you some, because I'm not cleaning it."  So, he took me home to my mother [Rosetta Hall Moody].  And my mother said, "Well, no, that's not, that's not, that's not what I send him to school for.  He's not going to do it.  See, now, if he's wrong, he would be mine; I'd make him.  But no, he's not going to do that."  "Well, he's going to have to stay home a day."  "Fine.  But I'm not going to clean up this whole--I did what I was supposed to do."  And I mean, I just, I guess I've never been one who was afraid to speak my mind.  I mean I--in fact, I did tell those people at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], "I don't have one speech for black folks when I'm talking to black students or black faculty or a black audience, and another speech when I'm talking to white folks.  I got one speech.  And what I say, that's it."  Because my philosophy is black folks can't play it safe.  You ain't never safe.  You might as well do what you got to do, and say what you got to say.  Because they'll fire you one day anyway.  And to me, the saddest black folks in the world are black folks who do everything the white folks want them to do, and they kick them up the butt.  You see, and my thing is, I say to my colleagues, I say, "Look, the worse mistake a black person can make is to believe it when white folks tell you that you're different.  You're only different as long as you have some utility for them.  And when your utility is used up, you're just another."
Story_ID: 296163
Speaker 1: Now in high school [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]--or grade school--now, you played sports.  You played football--
Speaker 2: I played football in high school.
Speaker 1: In high school, okay.
Speaker 2: My junior year.
Speaker 1: And what did you play?
Speaker 2: Quarterback.
Speaker 1: Quarterback, okay.  So, did the team do any good?
Speaker 2: We won state championship my senior year.  I wasn't the starting quarterback, but I played, I was a vital part of it.  And when they won, I was a vital part of the team.  And yeah, in my--we lost two games in my junior year to the same team, once in the state championship and once in the regular season.  But--
Speaker 1: What was the team you lost to?
Speaker 2: We lost to Ruston, Ruston High [School, Ruston, Louisiana].  But we won eleven straight my senior year.  And we played in the first Ebony Bowl [ph.] in Hammond, Louisiana.  We played Eureka High [School] from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in Hammond, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Eureka High from Hattiesburg?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, did--so the high schools had to, the black high schools had to play each other across state lines to get a--
Speaker 2: No, we didn't play--that was the Ebony Bowl.  That was matching the best high school in Louisiana against the best high school in Mississippi.  But we went all over the state playing.  We would play up in Shreveport [Louisiana] and Ruston [Louisiana].  We'd play in New Orleans [Louisiana], you know, or even in Baton Rouge [Louisiana]; we played McKinley [Senior] High [School] in Baton Rouge.  But that's another point for me that kind of--well, it irritates me.  And I've said this to some of the coaches and some of the people.  These, these--back when my brothers and all the black kids were going to the black colleges, these white schools wouldn't play them; these white colleges wouldn't play them.  And they would, and they would say these boys don't have the fundamentals; they can't play.  Now, these sons and grandsons of these same folks, they're blue chippers; they're recruiting all these black kids.  You just look at these teams.  Alabama [University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama] got eleven black.  Mississippi State [University, Starkville, Mississippi], Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi].  But they would not play those--now, they're blue chippers.  Before, they didn't have the fundamentals, they didn't have the facilities.  I mean, you know, but now they got all the black kids.  And every one of these white schools now, especially in basketball, will play at least one black team during the year.  Now, the University of Dayton [Dayton, Ohio] wouldn't play Central State [College of Education and Industrial Arts at Wilberforce; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] when I was in school.  The Dayton Air Strikers would, the semi-pro team.  But the University of Dayton wouldn't play Central State in basketball.
Speaker 1: And they had an all-white team, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Except for Bobby Jones [ph.], was it?
Speaker 2: Well, see, when I was there in '50 [1950] to '54 [1954], they were all white, Don Donoher [Donald Donoher] and all them guys.  We were, we all ended up together down in Fort Benning [Georgia] in basic officers' training school [Officer Candidate School].  And I remember my brother talking about--my brother Horace [Moody] talking about when all those guys got drafted from Southern [University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and from LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], they played each other.  The boys from Southern put a little something on them.
Story_ID: 296164
Speaker 1: Now, did you run for class office in high school [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], or that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, but I'll tell you what.  I had an experience and, and that book 'Grandpa Remembers' [ph.].  Between my junior and senior year, they finally started a boy--you know how they have, they had the Pelican Boys State for the white kids.  Well, finally in my--between my junior and senior year, they had the Bayou Boys State--the first time for black schools where you go on campus and you learn, and they divide you up, in like Rice City, this city--and you run for mayor and different things.  And I ran for mayor of the city, Rice City, and I won.  But I never, I never held any offices in high school.  But I remember back in, when I was in high school there used to be friction between McKinley [Senior] High [School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], the public high school down in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], and Southern High [Southern University Laboratory School].  And they were trying to work out the tension, and they had a panel discussion; it was interesting.  The guys from Southern High, oh, they were on the panel, the ones from Southern High.  But then we had to go, they had to go that afternoon down to McKinley, and none of the guys wanted to go.  You know, then they asked me would I go, and I said, "Yeah, I'll go.  I'll be on the panel."  I mean because I had the same relationship with the guys from fourth grade through eighth grade.  And so it was no big, it was no big deal for me to go down there, because I was the same guy, and there was no difference.  But I never, no, I never ran for any office.  I was in the Hi-Y and stuff like that, but no, I didn't--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grades were pretty good I would guess, under those conditions.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, they weren't where I wanted them to be, except in spelling and reading, until my sister-in-law [Estella Martin Moody] taught me how to spell.  But no, I mean I was probably average, a little better than average in high school and elementary school.  But see, my mother [Rosetta Hall Moody] and father [James Moody, Sr.], they never pushed us about grades.  "Learn something," she'd always say.  "If you learn something, no one can take that from you."  And we followed that same philosophy with our three sons.  We didn't push them, "You've got to get A's, you've got to get Bs."  No, "You learn something."  And my thing with them was "Did you give it your best shot?"  Now, if your best shot was a B, that's all I can ask of you.  Now, if it wasn't your best shot, and you got a B, then I got a little problem with that.  All I want you to do is give it your best shot.  So, at the end of the day, you can say I gave it my best."  That's all.  That's all anybody can ask.  In fact, our high school principal used to say when we used to get ready to go play football, she would say to us, "Do your best.  Your best may not be the best, but that's all that God and man can require of you."  And that's all I ask anybody--when--my staff--I say, you know, give it your best shot, that's all, do your best.
Story_ID: 296165
Speaker 1: So when you were--how was your social life in high school [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?  Did you have girlfriends in high school, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I had some girls I liked, but I don't know if I called them girlfriends or not.  But yeah, I guess I had a girlfriend, or somebody I liked.  But I guess it wasn't--that wasn't a very critical piece of the social fabric for me.  Friends, you get along.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you, when you were a senior, I suppose you had to be thinking about going to college, since all your brothers and sisters--
Speaker 2: Well, see, that wasn't the question.  It was just where I was going to go.  In fact, I can remember talking to my mother [Rosetta Hall Moody], sitting on the back porch.  And I told her, I said, "I want to go away to school.  I don't want to go to Southern [University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] ."  I said, "Every Moody since '35 [1935] has been going to Southern."  I said, "Now, I want to go somewhere where nobody knows me, and I don't know anybody.  So if I make it, I make it on my own merits.  If I don't make it, I didn't make it because I didn't have it, and it's not somebody that's measuring me about what seven other Moodys did before me."  And she said, "Well, Baby, I would love for you to go."  And I had sent stuff to Central State [College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  Well, it was the College of Education and Industrial Arts [College of Education and Industrial Arts at Wilberforce, Wilberforce, Ohio] then, because it couldn't have been split too long.  And she said--but you know, we didn't have any money with eight kids.  My daddy [James Moody, Sr.] didn't make any money.  But she said to me, she said, "Now, I'm gonna call my brother," my Uncle Horace [H.G. Hall].  And she called him and she said, "Look," she said, "If you can get him to Chicago [Illinois], I'll see that he gets to Central State and go to--and get to college."  So, I think it was about forty dollars or something to ride the Illinois Central [Railroad] to Chicago.  And I got there, and my brother Joe [Joseph Moody] met me.  I spent the night, and the next day he got me straight and sent me to Chicago, and he helped me while I was there.  And so, he--and I appreciate that, because he did that for his, for his sister because she asked him.
Story_ID: 296166
Speaker 1: So, you arrived at Central State [College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  And then it was, you said it was going through changes.  The school, we kind of described the changes off-camera.  But in 1948 [sic. 1947], it was Wilberforce [College of Education and Industrial Arts at Wilberforce; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: It was Wilberforce University.  But see, what people don't, sometimes don't understand is that the state always supported the College of Education and the Industrial Arts [College of Education and Industrial Arts at Wilberforce] part of Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio].  And so, that's why they were able to separate out.  And the natural breaking point was the ravine.  There used to be a big ravine right by O'Neil Hall.  And that separated Central State from the church side, as we called it, from Wilberforce.  And Wilberforce had [James A.] Shorter Hall, had the Carnegie Library, and then going towards the back road was the Theological Seminary.
Speaker 1: Payne, right.
Speaker 2: Payne Theological Seminary [Wilberforce, Ohio].  And so, but all of the things on the north side of the ravine was Central State--O'Neill Hall, Bundy Hall--
Speaker 1: Arnett [Hall].
Speaker 2: Arnett, the Galloway Hall, Poindexter Hall, Mitchell Hall, the, the Grill, the power plant.  And they just built the medical science building the year before I got there, and the gymnasium and the Hallie Q. Brown Library [Hallie Q. Brown Memorial Library, Wilberforce, Ohio].  Then they had the Quanton Hudson [ph.] and the barracks back there, Young Hall [ph.], and all that.  So, it was--there was always--it was just like most universities, where you have different schools and colleges.  And so, the state was supporting the education.
Speaker 1: So, they had some kind of financial crisis that caused it to spiral--
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly what it was.  But then [Charles H.] Wesley became, he was the president of Wilberforce, and he just came over and was the president of Central.  And to me, he was, he was a great person.  I mean he knew every kid on campus by name.
Speaker 1: Now, this is Charles H. Wesley, who is a colleague of Carter G. Woodson?
Speaker 2: He wrote the book.  That's the same man.
Speaker 1: Yes, all right.
Speaker 2: He wrote the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] history ['History of Sigma Pi Phi: First of the Negro-American Greek-Letter Fraternities,' Charles H. Wesley] he wrote Alpha Phi Alpha [Fraternity] history ['The History of Alpha Phi Alpha: A Development in College Life,' Charles H. Wesley], and he was quite the historian.  And all, all the girls loved him.  They just thought he was the finest thing. (Laughter) He was a gentleman and a scholar, he was really, he had time for you.  I mean, he would talk to you all the time, and he always had an encouraging word for you.  And I guess that's the thing that I liked about Wilberforce and Central State and the black colleges [HBCUs].  When you came on that campus, that was a message that you're important; you're going to do something; you're going to be somebody.  And when you leave here, you're going to make a contribution.  And I didn't find that at white institutions.  It was, and I used to say this all the time, so you can go back and hear some of my speeches and some of my--it was like somebody--they wanted to make black students feel that somebody was doing them a favor by letting them be there.  And I used to say to the students, "Look, this is your university.  Until the president and the regents and provosts go to Lansing [Michigan] and to Washington, D.C. and say, 'Look, I don't want any money raised from the taxes of black folks to run this institution. This is your institution.  Nobody's doing you a favor.  Nobody's letting you be here.  You walk tall, you be proud, and you come. You know, and not every white kid that comes here is a 1600 on the SAT and 4.0.  And not every black kid that comes here is 700 and 2.0.  And you have every right to be here.  And don't let anybody make you feel, feel bad or feel like they're doing you a favor.  This is your university.'"
Story_ID: 296167
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the teachers and administrators at Central State [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] other than Charles [H.] Wesley.  I know there's Wilhelmina [S.] Robinson.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well, there was Wilhelmina Robinson.  And I was in science, so I had Uncle Sapp.  I don't know if you know him, Isaac Sapp Lane.  Uncle Sapp was a biology teacher, a science teacher, and he was a former semi-pro baseball player.  Uncle Sapp was, he was a great guy.  I mean, Uncle Sapp and I really had some good conversations.  Because Uncle Sapp to some extent reminded me somewhat of my father [James Moody, Sr.], in his mannerisms and the way they looked.  And Sapp would go to the Grill, and guys would be in there playing bid whist.  And he'd just say, "The Ides of March are upon you."  In other words, he was going to drop a pop quiz on your rump tomorrow, you know.  And his wife was a Ph.D. in psychology from Minnesota, a very refined, elegant lady.  But she loved her some Uncle Sapp, because Sapp would tell us, "Man, when I had to come to that town playing ball, the girls from miles around would come.  And they'd say, 'Did you seed him?'  'Yeah, I seed him.'"  So, we'd ask her, I said, "Aunt Lane, is that true?"  She said, "Yeah, the girls would say, 'Did you seed him?'"  (Laughter) Then there was old man Pearl [ph.]; Cooper [ph.]; Mr. Craft.  Tommy Craft [Thomas J. Craft, Sr.] had just finished his master's [degree] and was working on his Ph.D. at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  And he was my teacher, and I still stay in touch with him, you know.  Mr. Walker, "Big Jim" Walker [James Walker], was a football coach, a line coach.  And his wife taught English, she was my English teacher.  And old man Woodson was a math teacher.  And Miss Boulware was the--
Speaker 1: What Woodson was this?
Speaker 2: You know, I can't think of old man Woodson's first name.  But he was a math teacher.
Speaker 1: The Woodsons are, there's a family of famous Woodsons.  I don't know if you know about--
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: They go all the way back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: It might be--
Speaker 1: Lewis Woodson, and they're related to Thomas Jefferson.
Speaker 2: I didn't know they--
Speaker 1: They didn't, nobody talked about it then, but they are.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: They are.
Speaker 2: Yeah, big head boys.  (Laughter) Yeah, old man Woodson, he did a lot of math and stuff.  And he had a nephew that went there.  But Miss Boulware was the house mother.
Story_ID: 296168
Speaker 1: But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How do you spell her name?
Speaker 1: I think it's B-O-U-L-W-A-R-E, Boulware. B-O-U-L-W-A-R-E, Boulware.
Speaker 2: Oh, Boulware, okay.
Speaker 1: She was the house mother at O'Neil [Hall].  And my wife [Christella Moody] was a freshman [at Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] when I was a senior.  But even before my wife came, Miss Boulware was always nice to me.  She'd let me come in and sit down and watch the TV and stuff, you know.  I had some good, I had some good people.  Mr. Batey, Mr. Batey was, he was in charge of the supplies for ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  But he and his wife ran an eat shack right there on the corner of the main street, when you get ready to turn to go by Payne Theological Seminary [Wilberforce, Ohio], but--and I'll tell you, between my sophomore year, I don't know, I got depressed.  I don't know what was eating on me that day, and I was getting ready to quit school.  And I went to turn in my uniform, and Mr. Batey said to me, he said, "Take the uniform back, and you think about it over the weekend.  And if you want to turn it, go ahead."  Then my brother, James [Moody] was living in Dayton [Ohio] at the time, and I talked with him.  And Monday, I didn't even think about it no more.
Speaker 2: That was Mrs. Batey who talked to you?
Speaker 1: Mr. Batey.
Speaker 2: Mr. Batey.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't think about it anymore.  I mean, I went on in advanced ROTC and graduated and got my commission.  And the rest is history.
Speaker 2: They had a ROTC tradition there that was really strong.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Dating back to [Colonel] Charles Young.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, see now, in fact, Mother Young [Ada Mills Young] was the mother of our fraternity, because Charles Young was in the fraternity.
Speaker 2: So Mother Young was his--
Speaker 1: Wife, that was his wife.
Speaker 2: Okay, now we have to get--this is history.  We're trying to make--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Mother Young, yeah, she was the mother of Omega Psi Phi [Fraternity] for back then.  In fact, in my yearbook I have a picture of the frat, and we're taking her body into Galloway [Tower].  I'll show it to you. You might find it useful.  But yeah, we used to go down to the farmhouse.  They're trying to restore that and make some historic site out of it.  But yeah, in fact we'd do some of our initiations at the house there.  But she was our, she was our, she was the mother of our fraternity.
Story_ID: 296169
Speaker 1: Well, how did you do in school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did well.
Speaker 1: I mean did your academics pick up there?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I did well.  I was a, I was a, I was a fairly decent student at Central State [College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], I did well.  I mean, I didn't, I didn't have any--I didn't have anything I was trying to prove to anybody, because there was nobody--I mean Big Jim [James Walker] knew my brother from football, I mean because they coached against each other and stuff.  But it was nobody there saying, you know, "Here's this whole long list of Moodys," you know.  And you know, so I did well.  You know, I was ready to graduate, and then I had to take about six hours in my senior year, I--my senior year, I mean I wasn't pushed.  I did all right.
Story_ID: 296170
Speaker 1: So you met your wife [Christella Moody] there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you were getting ready to graduate.  Now, did you leave her at Central State [College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Well, we got married the second semester of her sophomore year.  She had, she was finishing her second year.  We got married that March, March 5th.  And I went to Panama, and she joined me after school was out.
Speaker 1: In the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was an officer, so she came down to Panama and we spent time there.  And our son [Charles David Moody, Jr.]--first son was conceived there, and they thought she was going to have some difficulty, so she came back.  But that's an interesting piece with her down in Panama.  She, she's a brainiac.  I mean, if she made a B in all her career, I'd be surprised.  Because she was seventeen, but she was finishing her second year of college.  But when we were down in Panama--
Speaker 1: She grew up in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Virginia [F.] Lewis was her principal, they're still friends.  Virginia Lewis is ninety-something years old, and they talk to each other, Dr. Virginia Lewis.  But anyway, I'll say about this--I promised her and her mother that she was going to, you know, finish school, and I--and all.  And so LSU, Louisiana State University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana], had a branch on Fort Davis [Panama], okay.  And she took some classes there, and she made A+.  I mean, she was smoking.  The professor was so impressed that he talked to the dean at LSU, at the Baton Rouge [Louisiana] campus, about this student.  The dean came, flew down to Panama to Fort Davis, and talked to my wife about being the test case to desegregate the undergraduate school at LSU.  And he said, "You're the perfect case.  Because one, you've already been admitted as a regular student.  Your grades and your work is outstanding."  She talked to her mother, and her mother said, "No.  You'll be spending the rest of your life in court and all of that.  You just come on back to Chicago or wherever and get your degree."  And so, that went by the wayside.  And it was good, because we came back--when I got out of the Army we came back to Chicago and she finished, she finished in '58 [1958], you know.  And then we had a son.
Speaker 1: Now, she graduated from Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Chicago Teachers College.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you went there, too, didn't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got my master's [degree] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) For your master's. Okay.
Speaker 2: --in science education from Chicago Teachers College.
Story_ID: 296171
Speaker 1: Now this is, when did you get your master's [degree from Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: In '61 [1961].  I think she [Moody's wife, Christella Moody] got her undergraduate degree in '58 [1958].  That was, that was a juggling set of days.  Because she was, she was--I think one time she was taking about eighteen hours or twenty hours or something, and student teaching; and we had a kid [Charles David Moody, Jr.]. She still graduated with honors.  And I tried to get a job when I first came out of the [U.S.] Army.  And they had an ad in the Sun--Chicago Sun-Times that they needed somebody to work in one of the--I don't know what the company name was, I can't remember, but one of the big companies.  And they said they needed somebody, and all he needed was to have high school or a semester of high school chemistry.  I called and talked to the lady.  I said, "You know, I see this job, and I'd like to apply for this job."  And she said, "Well, have you finished high school?"  I said, "Yes."  "Have you finished college?"  I said, "Yes."  "Have you had any chemistry?"  I said, "Yeah."  She said, "Well, I think you'll get bored with this job."  I said, "For a hundred and fifty dollars a week, I think I could handle the boredom."  I had to take a job at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] animal research lab, sifting through dog feces looking for tapeworms, for this guy that was developing some medicine to see about tapeworms, okay, for two hundred [dollars] a month.  Our rent was a hundred a month.  My wife made all of our clothes, hers, mine, the baby's.  And we used to go do our grocery shopping--we lived at 71st [street] and Harvard [Avenue].  And we used to walk to 63rd [Street] and Halsted [Street] to Hillman's, and bring our groceries back in the baby bucket.  Our kids, our kid--we had one kid then--got his shots at the welfare office.  And then we were looking for an apartment.  I don't know how or who to--but we got a call from the real estate guy that said, "We got this nice apartment," and it was a nice apartment.  And I used to just watch when we moved there the IC [Illinois Central Railroad] train ran, the track ran right down--not the IC--the Rock Island [Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad], ran right by our house.  When we first moved there, there was tons of white people getting on the train, you know.  By time we moved, there were no white folks getting on the train.  Then I got a job--
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sorry, where did you move to?  Where was it?
Speaker 2: 71st and Harvard.
Speaker 1: 71st and Harvard, okay.
Story_ID: 296172
Speaker 1: I got a job working out at Oak Forest Hospital [Oak Forest Health Center, Oak Forest, Illinois].  Not only did I work at Oak Forest, but I was in the National Guard, and I was taking a full load at Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].  Because I got the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], which paid me $160 a month.  And the tuition was like a dollar and a half an hour, a credit hour.  And I worked at the post office on the weekend.  Chris [Christella Moody] went to school and took a full load, worked in the dean--the graduate school office, and worked at Time magazine.  She graduated and started teaching at Wadsworth Upper Grade Center [Chicago, Illinois] over on 63rd [Street] and, I can't remember the street.  But anyway, I'm trying to say that we, we were folks--and we were a team.  And I finished and got my master's [degree], and then she went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and got her master's, and I got a six-year certificate, Certificate of Advanced Study.  And then I started teaching special ed [special education] in the Chicago Public Schools.  And--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, let me just catch up on the dates.  Now, the university--you went to the University of Chicago?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was, it's on my resume.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: It's on my resume.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But it was '69 [1969], '68 [1968].  And then I started teaching out in Posen-Robbins [School District] at Bishop 147th [ph.].  And I left there, and I went up to Evanston [Illinois].  And there I saw the difference in the resources between Posen-Robbins and Evanston.  Because the school that I taught at, and was an assistant principal at, served the east side of Skokie [Illinois].  And I stayed there, and I left there and became superintendent of schools out in Harvey, Illinois, District 147.
Speaker 2: Harvey, that's the home of The Dells.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  In fact, they really, I think that's the one from Dixmoor [Illinois], really.  And Dixmoor was a part of my school district.  I had the west side of Harvey.  That's--a lot of this is written in that book that my wife wrote about my life.
Story_ID: 296173
Speaker 1: You know, serendipity and divine providence is very important.  Because while I was superintendent [of schools in Harvey, Illinois], my secretary went out to lunch, and the phone rang.  And I picked up the phone, being the nice fellow that I am.  I got to talking to this person.  So this person calling, well, she had the wrong phone number, she had the wrong number.  She wanted some people in East Chicago Heights [Illinois; Ford Heights, Illinois].  I said, "Well, what is it you're doing?"  She said, "We're doing a study, and we're working with black elected officials."  I said, "Well, you know, I'm interested in doing something on black school superintendents."  And I said, "Do you guys give out scholarships or any grants or something?"  She said, "Well, I tell you what.  You can talk with Hylan Lewis." You know, Hylan Lewis, the sociologist.  And he runs the fellows program for Ken Clark [Kenneth Clark].  Ken Clark had the Metropolitan Applied Research Corporation [Metropolitan Applied Research Center].  And so, what happened, one day I sent some of my teachers up to Evanston [Illinois] for a science program they were having.  Charles Martin [ph.] was running that program, and he used to be the coordinator of science for the Evanston District 65.  And he said to me, he said, "Chuck [HistoryMaker Charles D. Moody, Sr.], you ought to think about this program for next year."  And I said, "What is it?"  He said, "It's the Triple T program--training the teachers [Training Teachers of Teachers]."  And I said, "Well, okay."  He said, "Call this guy, Bill Hazard."  I said, "Okay, I'll call Bill Hazard."  And I called Bill Hazard, and I said, "Dr. Hazard, I understand you have this program, and I'd like to think about applying for it for the following year."  He said, "Why not this year?"  I said, "Well, send me the materials."  He sent me the materials, I got it, and applied.  And I was accepted, and started working on my Ph.D.  And--
Speaker 2: Now, this is through what university?
Speaker 1: Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Northwestern.
Story_ID: 296174
Speaker 1: And so, I used to drive from Harvey [Illinois] to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] a couple times a week in the evening to take my classes.  And then I was talking to this lady after I'd gotten in.  I was talking to this lady about Kenneth Clark's program.  And she said, "Well, you talk to Hylan."  Well, I didn't know Hylan Lewis at the time.  And my, one of my professors, Ray Mack [Raymond W. Mack], knew him.  He said, "Oh, I know Hylan.  We're on the American Sociological Society [American Sociological Association] board or something together."  He said, "But he's in Europe now.  But when he comes back, I'll talk with him."  So, I said "Fine."  So, Hylan came back in town, and I got a call from MARC of the Metropolitan Applied Research Corporation [Metropolitan Applied Research Center].  And he, they asked me, they said, "Well, can you come to New York [New York] tomorrow, day after tomorrow?"  I said, "Yeah."  It just so happened I had to go to Connecticut.  I was running the d- I was working on--I said, "I can--."  I had moved to Michigan, and I had finished all my coursework and I was down in Michigan.  I said, "Oh, yeah, I can come to New York," because I had to go to Connecticut.  So, I go to Connecticut, and I fly down to New York.  And I meet with Hylan Lewis, Kenneth Clark, and Dixie Moon.  Now, Dixie Moon is the niece of Professor [Laurence C.] Jones, who started Piney Wood School [Piney Woods Country Life School] down in Piney Wood, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Dixie Moon, M-O-O-N?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Moon, like the moon.  And so, we sat down and I was talking with Kenneth Clark.  And I said to him, I said "Look, I'm interested in doing my dissertation on a study on black school superintendents."  I said, "But I don't want to do a regular study.  I don't want to send out any questionnaire; I don't want to go visit any school districts.  I want to bring these superintendents together so we can sit and talk; so they can know each other and they can share information; and so they can begin to feel that they're not out there by themselves.  And before I left, we had made the arrangements for the meeting out at O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois], the Marriott at O'Hare, and I invited--and I have the letter, it's in that book.  I have the letter that I wrote to those superintendents for them to come.  And we met and we talked about things that--everybody, you know, on the first day they're stiff.  You know, everybody had the best situation in the world, and nobody had any problems.  And I told Joe Hill [Joseph E. Hill], I said, "Joe, something's not right."  I said, "I know all these boys ain't got this good a thing."  So Joe said, "I'll tell you what.  Let's take them down to Lem's [Lem's Bar-B-Q, Chicago, Illinois] or go down to Lurlean's [Chicago, Illinois].  We go down to Lurlean's, and right next to Lurlean's, you know, is Lem's Barbeque on 75th [Street].  So, we're sitting in there.  We go in and get a couple of mess of ribs and hot links and some tips. And we come back, and [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory drops in.  And he started talking to them and he just, like, put on an impromptu--about an hour show for the guys, just talking.  We loaded them back up in the station wagon and stuff, and went back to the hotel.  The next morning, the tone of the meeting was all different.  "Well, you know, I got a problem.  You know, how do you handle, how do you handle this with your--."  And that was it.  And the guys felt a kinship, and that was the beginning of NABSE [National Alliance of Black School Educators] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of NABSE.
Story_ID: 296175
Speaker 1: Yeah, so NABSE [National Alliance of Black School Educators].  You're at Lem's Bar-B-Q [Chicago, Illinois]--Lurlean's [Chicago, Illinois] and Lem's, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lurlean's yeah.
Speaker 1: And then you go to Lem's?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory comes in and talks.  And then people just started talking about--
Speaker 2: They loosened up.
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of problems did they talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, they were talking about contract problems, board/superintendent relationships, student achievement, the community, getting the community involved.  See, that was a new phenomenon.  Because this was the first wave of black school superintendents, you see.  And so, many of the school districts, you know, at the head you had the superintendent up here.  But all these people between the superintendent and the teachers and the students, were still white--the people who led the contracts, the people would do this or do that.  So, they had difficulty with information going up and down, you know, getting from the superintendent down to the teachers, and getting from the teachers up to the superintendent, I mean, those kind of problems.  Some of the, the loss of revenue.  See, one of the things that--a couple things I found in my study, in my dissertation ['Black Superintendents in Public School Districts: Trends and Conditions'], was that there were certain conditions that had be to be present in a school district before they named a black superintendent.  One of the conditions was it had to be in financial straits.  It had to be majority black or minority--or moving in that direction, you know, the--they had a lot of Title 1 [of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 1965] money, a lot of poverty.
Speaker 1: That they could better get if they had a black head of the school?
Speaker 2: No, it's just that these are the conditions.  I mean, so, and then again, white superintendents were not looking to have to deal with these issues, as these school districts became black.  But now if you--you know, so you began to get a lot of issues.  People were beginning to lose confidence in the school system.  And so, I have that in my dissertation, and I'll show you the findings.  But that's the thing.  But these conditions are the same now.  But if you notice, recently, black superintendents are not being replaced by black superintendents.  Chicago [Illinois], Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I mean these places are now are now beginning to get white superintendents, and they're not educators, they are from the corporate sector.
Speaker 1: They're managers, basically.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, and, and, so now these big school districts, these school districts now, they used to be the crown--I used to say they used to be the jewel in the white superintendent's crown, to end up in Chicago, or New York [New York], or Philly, or L.A. [Los Angeles, California], or Frisco.  But during that period in the '70s [1970s], and the mid to late '80s [1980s] or '90s [1990s], you had a lot of blacks.  And it went from about--I think I had sixteen black superintendents at the first meeting, up to maybe 250 or three hundred.  But that number is not running as fast, because blacks are not necessarily being replaced by black superintendents.
Speaker 1: So, you said the trend now is for there to be more white managerial-types taking--
Speaker 2: Well, even the blacks they're putting in there now have been military or from the corporate sector.  But I think we're going to probably get away from that, 'cause they'll probably go back to getting the educators to run the school districts.
Story_ID: 296176
Speaker 1: Now these are some of the issues that superintendents had then.  Are they still, I mean are those still basically the same?
Speaker 2: Basically, basically, basically the same kind of thing--how are you going to do more with less money?  How are you going to, you know, how--well, you look at a lot of these districts, and you see the expectations are very high, but the resources are dwindling, you know.  But I think when--I was in Tampa [Florida] yesterday.  And teachers and administrators, you know, talking to each other and talking to other people and saying, "Look, you will never see that many educated, successful, blacks in one place as you do at NABSE [National Alliance of Black School Educators]," to the young people.  And one of my things is we have to be grooming people to take our place.  See, we have to be mentors and sponsors.  Because I did a study on becoming a superintendent--contest or sponsor mobility.  And people have to understand that when you get to a certain level in the career ladder, you don't apply for jobs; somebody drops your name in the hat.  An unsolicited application is the kiss of death.  So, we need to be sponsors and mentors.  You don't--nobody gets anywhere by themselves.  And, and, my thing is it takes a certain kind of person to be a mentor.  See, you have to enter a mentoring relationship with the hope, desire, and expectation that the person you are mentoring will someday surpass you.  If that person doesn't surpass you, then you, he, and a whole lot of folks wasted some time.  But you see, you can't be the personality and have the ego set that you have to be top dog all the time.  You are mentoring somebody to do better, to do more than what you have done and what you are doing.  Because they shouldn't have to fall into the same traps and pits that you fell in.  They shouldn't have to start from the same place that you started from.  And so I mean, so that's been one of the things--the networking, the sponsorship, the mentoring.  You know, and I hope really that young people--old people--see but there's a missing element--that a lot of young people think things have been this way all the time, and there's been no blood, sweat, and tears for them to be able to do what they're doing.  And they need to know, they need to know about the blood, sweat, and tears.  I used to tell the students at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], I said, "It's people in my generation, it's our fault that you believe and act that way."  Because many of us called ourselves shielding our kids from the harshness of what went before, and we crippled them, because they really don't understand.  And we need to have that history so they can see, so they can know, so they can talk, so they go to archives and pull these things up.  And I hope you gotta get it so that everybody knows about this, that people will see that they were just ordinary people who didn't give up.
Story_ID: 296177
Speaker 1: What in your estimation would be the highlights of NABSE [National Alliance of Black School Educators], you know, what NABSE has been able to do?
Speaker 2: One thing I think has been--we've developed some programs.  And there's a document that was published by NABSE called 'Saving the African-American Child.'  And it's just talking about academic and cultural excellence, and having the high expectations and teaching kids algebra in the fifth grade or third grade, or whatever, so that's there some expectation--that there's some cultural excellence--that, that people get together and talk about and deal with and share information.  Programs, effective programs--we have an academy, Ron Edmonds Academy [Ron Edmonds Summer Academy], that's dealing with the principles of Ron Edmonds [Ronald Edmonds], who said every child can learn.  But the problem is, is that education of interest to us? And do we really want kids to learn?  You know, education for a long time has been, what?  Sorting and sifting, and saying, "Hey, you're going to be something.  But we need some folks to do the menial tasks.  We need somebody to do some--but you folks, y'all going to be it."  And so, we sort and we sift, and we weed out.  We nurture some people to go and do some things.  You know, flowers are not going to grow if I don't put no fertilizer on them, if I don't nurture those flowers, if I don't tend to the flowers.  But if I tend to the flowers, they're gonna grow.  And they can't grow by themselves.  And I think, you know--just friendship. What--I tell you, people will tell you NABSE has workshops and great sessions at the annual conference.  We have regional affairs.  We have some people who've been fighting in the vineyard for a long time, and it's time that we try to--and we are beginning to get the young people coming along and taking a leadership role.
Story_ID: 296178
Speaker 1: What do you think is the most effective, list some of the most effective things or stratagems or programs in black education today?  I know we've had, we've got, [HistoryMaker Dr.] James Comer has his program--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where they do a lot of counseling in the schools, and try to get the parents involved.  You've got the Algebra Project with Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He just got another grant from the MacArthur Foundation [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the Genius Grant for that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You've got like various African-centered school projects in Detroit [Michigan] and elsewhere, where people try to change their culture content curriculum.  So, what do you, what do you think?  People tried all-male academies and female academies for black students.  I mean, and yet the, a lot of the schools in the black community, in the urban, big urban cities that are mostly black ones around the country--[Washington] D.C., Detroit, Chicago [Illinois], are all struggling, you know.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you.  My take on that is one: expectation, okay.  For instance, when you come to interview and (unclear) somebody, do you have a blank mind, or do you have some expectations?  And I'm not trying to put you on the spot, do you understand.  So, when kids come into a school, the expectations are communicated a lot of times non-verbally.  How often do I call on you?  How close do I get to you?  What kind of encouragement do I give to you?  What kind of feedback do I give you?  Am I saying, "Okay, this is a bunch of poor kids, they can't learn?"  Or, "Here is a wealth of potential," and how do we mine that potential?  Do we go in with the notion that all kids can learn?  Or as Barbara Sizemore [HistoryMaker Barbara A. Sizemore] used to say to folks, she said, "You know, people talk about kids coming from a one parent family, and why they can't learn, and they can't do this and they can't do that because they ain't got buy one parent."  She said, "That means you can't don't nothing with an orphan."  But if the kid's an orphan, that means it's hopeless.  So, why not say, "This kid has innate ability."  You know, I didn't have three squares every day when I was a kid.  But people used to say, "The Moodys, they might not have no food, but I bet they got some books in the house."  People had expectations, and that's a critical piece of this.  Do we expect--do we really want our kids to learn?  Is the education of all kids of interest to us?  Ron Edmonds [Ronald Edmonds] said, "We can teach all kids whose education is of an interest to us."  Now, that's the thing.  I mean you can run a litany of reasons why people can't do something.  And you communicate that to people, you know.  I mean, you can have an all-male school, but if you send out the same message to all the boys, it's not going to make any difference.  And if you don't--if kids--somebody was saying this.  "If kids can't learn the way I teach, then I'd better learn to teach the way he learns."  I mean, I don't know if you know Dorothy Strong, who was a math teacher.  She was a part of the [Benjamin] Banneker Project, right. She and my wife [Christella Moody], years ago had some kids that failed, and they were trying to get them ready to go to high school.  They just had the summer.  And they had a math and a language arts program.  And those kids blossomed.  Why?  Because there was an expectation; there was good instruction of techniques; the curriculum was relevant to those kids; and it was just a clear message, "I believe in you.  I know you can do it."  I mean, that's the thing.  That's what I said when I went to Central State [College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], and when I went to high school [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], to elementary school.  I mean, I was rebellious, but folks were saying, "Boy, you're going to, you can do it.  You're going to be something, you're going to do something."  And that message was very clear, very clear, that people expected that.  And if they didn't, you weren't just letting yourself down, you were letting them down.
Story_ID: 296179
Speaker 1: We mentioned earlier in passing, Dr. Barbara Sizemore [HistoryMaker Barbara A. Sizemore].  She's, she's no longer with us, but she was a mentor to many, and so, I know a key figure in that sense.  So, can you maybe give us a little bit about her?
Speaker 2: Oh, she, she was a warrior.  I mean, she--as I have said about her and a couple of others--she took no prisoners when it came to children.  I mean you could mess over her, but you don't mess over the kids.  And she just believed that kids and people ought to have the best shot at education as possible.  And she didn't, she didn't, she didn't, she didn't, she didn't give any quarters.  I mean she really believed it, and she was not afraid to take risks.  And she said what she believed, and believed what she said.  And she wouldn't compromise her principles on that, I don't care who she was talking with or dealing with.  She just, she believed.  She was tough, but then she had a sense of humor.  We had, we had, my wife [Christella Moody] and I, we had good times together.  But she was, she had high expectations, but she respected people. She respected people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, two other people, figures, come to mind that you met along the way.  I don't know how well you know them, but Dr. Arthur Edward Thomas at Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], he was, I think he was coming in as you were going out I guess?
Speaker 2: No, he was behind me, but he was president when I was inducted into the Central State Hall of Fame.  Art and I, I knew him when he was running the Model Cities [education] project over in Dayton [Ohio].  And then he became president, and I began to work for him.  I worked closely with him and was very supportive of him, and I thought he did a good job.  I think President Garland [John W. Garland] there now is doing a good job.  I know him, and I've worked closely with him.  In fact, I just finished a study on historically black colleges [HBCUs] in the United States.  And that's a treasure that we cannot afford to lose.  When you look at the litany of graduates from these HBCUs and what they have done, it's just, I mean, I mean, you can ask yourself, where would the world be without Thurgood Marshall?  Or where would the world be without [W.E.B] Du Bois?  Or where would the world be without any number of people?
Speaker 1: Now, there's somebody else.  The other person I want to mention--you may not be aware of all of these, but it's [Baba] Hannibal Afrik, also known as Harold Charles, who graduated from Central with you, in biology.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was a beloved high school teacher in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And a political activist.
Speaker 2: Oh, very active.
Speaker 1: And a columnist for the Chicago Defender.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And also for maybe twenty years, the president and one of the--he wasn't the founder, but he came on shortly after it was founded--of something called the Council for Independent Black Institutions [sic. Council of Independent Black Institutions; CIBI], which was founded I think by Les Campbell [Leslie R. Campbell], also known as Jitu [K.] Weusi in Brooklyn, New York when they had the Ocean Hill Brownsville [Ocean Hill-Brownsville Experimental School District].
Speaker 2: In Brownsville [Brooklyn, New York], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they started--
Speaker 2: Rhody McCoy and them boys, yeah.
Speaker 1: And they started forming independent black schools around the country, of which there is still about fifty.  And Harold Charles was one of the key figures in that group, a presidential figure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know--
Speaker 1: And you both come out of--you founded NABSE [National Alliance of Black School Educators], and he's like one of the presidents of the Council for Independent Black Institutions.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know Chuck very well.  We call him Chuck Charles.  We go way back, and I remember him coming to Central, and like I said, he was a year behind me.  And we were in the National Guard together, in fact in the same company in the National Guard.  I haven't seen him in--see, I moved from Chicago about thirty-four years ago; in 1970 I moved to Michigan.  But we were, we were good friends.
Speaker 1: And he's retired in Port Gibson, Mississippi now.
Speaker 2: Oh, he's down in Port Gibson, Mississippi?  (Laughter) That's a long way from Rhode Island, or from wherever he came from out there on the East Coast.  Yeah, I didn't know that, yeah, Port Gibson.
Story_ID: 296180
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  Now, you became provost (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Vice provost.
Speaker 1: Vice provost, provost, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, vice provost.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you go to the University of Michigan?
Speaker 2: I went to the University of Michigan in 1970.  And I, I went there--well, this is a story within itself.  Again, I was working on my Ph.D., and I was up on campus.  It was in the summer, and one of the guys, Louis Irons, who worked for Office of Civil Rights [sic. Office for Civil Rights] Title IV office, called my house and he was talking to my wife [Christella Moody] about they wanted me to work at, think about coming to work in Michigan to run the deseg center.  And so I went, and it was a funded project for one year at a time, in 1970.  I started that, and we called it the Program for Ed--I mean the Program for Educational Opportunities [Program for Educational Opportunity, Title IV Race Desegregation Assistance Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And we dealt with race, sex, and national origin desegregation in Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois, and Wisconsin.  And we worked with school districts around the desegregation plan, and equity and equal opportunity.  And that's when I developed that four-dimensional model that helped to move school districts from segregation to integration.  And my take on that is, we have no truly integrated institutions in this country.  We have a lot of desegregated institutions, but we have not changed the corporate culture of those institutions.  We have not changed the policies and procedures to the extent that they're not the same policies and procedures that we use to operate segregated and unequal institutions.  So, I tell people all the time, don't use desegregation and integration synonymously; they're not the same.  One is body mixing, the first step of the model, and that is access to the institutions.  But then you have to deal with the second, which is the process.  And that's changing the corporate culture, changing the policies and procedures of the institutions.  And the third is achievement, and that is making sure that your achievement is recognized and rewarded.  And the third is--the fourth, is transfer.  In other words if I go to these institutions, these educational institutions, am I able to transfer that education that I received and the experiences that I had into jobs that will give me equal pay, power, privilege and prestige?  Now, so if we can do that, then you increase the access.  I mean in other words--but if I go through all of this and I can't transfer that into jobs--into things that are going to do that--then it's not really for real.  And so, I did that for seventeen years.  In fact, sometimes I think about how lucky I am.  Some of those little towns I went into, talking to people about desegregation and unfairness and all that--and I'm still here to talk about it. But I stayed there from 1970 to 1987.  And then in 1987, my wife and I were down in New Orleans [Louisiana].  She was at a conference, a curriculum conference.  And we were sitting down talking to [HistoryMaker] Ruth Love and some people.  And she just got up and said, "I got to go."
Story_ID: 296181
Speaker 1: You were talking about this meeting in 1987--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with your wife [Christella Moody] and [HistoryMaker] Ruth Love, and other people were there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And we were just sitting down, just the three of us.  And she said, "Well, I'm going back and start packing, because we have to be back in Ann Arbor [Michigan]."  I said, "We're going by Baton Rouge [Louisiana], I thought." She said, "Oh, we're going to have to go back."  I said, "Well, okay, if you want to go back, okay."  And so, she went to the room.  And while she was in the room packing, she got a call from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And the students were protesting, and about to close the place down.  And Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was coming there to meet with them.  And they said, well, Jesse and them said, "We're not going to do anything until you come.  Can you come back?"  So my wife said, "Well, you know, it's going to take some time and trouble trying to get--."  So, she made the arrangements and we came, I came back.  And I picked up Wade [H.] McCree.  I don't know--Wade McCree used to be the solicitor general of the United States.  He was a law professor, he's passed now, Wade McCree.  And we rode to this meeting together.  And these students were saying that they wanted an office of vice provost, or vice president for minority affairs.  And they wanted me to be the vice provost.  And after the big rally and stuff, we went to the Hill Auditorium.  And Jesse got up and made a comment about you're looking for a vice, you're looking for a vice provost, and he's got the best person right here.  And he called my name out there in front of an auditorium full of--but, anyway, I talked with the president, Harold [T.] Shapiro, who was president then about it, and I accepted the position.  And I always felt it was the students who made them create this position.  These folks didn't do this out the goodness of their hearts, that they wanted to be good fellows.  I say if those students hadn't been there with that pressure, they never would have created that position.  And so, I was appointed.  And we came up with some things.  That's why that thing on the wall back there is good for you to see.  I'll see if she has one, and maybe we can take a picture of it and use--but anyway, we talked about trying to do something.
Story_ID: 296182
Speaker 1: And my thing, and my take on that was I'm not looking to be the Messiah or another scapegoat for this.  This university [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] didn't get messed up overnight, and it's not going to get out of it overnight.  It didn't get mixed up by the acts and efforts of one person, and it's not going to get out of it by the acts and actions of one person.  Now, if I have to do everybody's job, then I want everybody's salary.  And so, we all have something to do.  We all have a role to play, we all have some things--and the whole thing is we get to change the climate of this institution.  But you see, you can't hide behind the notion of affirmative action or diversity.  See, diversity is a very neutral term.  See, if people can talk about diversity, then they don't have to own up to past segregation and discrimination.  "I'm just going to be diverse out of the goodness of my heart.  I just want more of y'all here, not that I kept you all out," so that you don't have to talk about it.  So, people have to deal with the notion of discrimination and segregation.  So, so, when you deal with that, that's one thing.  The other part of that is I tell folks we're going to have to stop making it seem as if every--that only black kids are getting financial aid.  I say out of seventy-five million--I don't know how many million exactly--for financial aid, blacks get--you're talking about you're putting three million dollars or five million dollars--I say that's not even one percent.  But see, you don't want to count assistantship, teaching assistantship, research assistantships, fellowships--all these ships these white folks are running around here on.  That's financial aid, but you don't want to talk about that.  You want to make it as if the three million dollars is all the financial aid that the school is giving out.  No, let's deal honestly; let's deal honestly with this.  You've got to be upfront.  And my thing was, "Look, I'm not afraid of losing a job, because I can always go back to the first job I had when I got out of the [U.S.] Army."  And you know what I told you it was?  Working at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], what I was doing--sifting through dog manure looking for tapeworms.  So, I'm not worried about that.  I'd rather get fired for the right reason than keep the job for the wrong reason.  Now, that was my thing.  I stayed there from '87 [1987] to, I stayed there five years, '92 [1992] to--
Speaker 2: To '91 [1991], was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ninety-one [1991], '92 [1992].
Story_ID: 296183
Speaker 1: Then I became the executive director of the South Africa Initiative Office [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], and my wife [Christella Moody] and I went to South Africa.  Well, you know, a lot--serendipity--I tell you about that all the time in my life. Because there was a guy who was the vice-chancellor, that's what they call the presidents in South Africa--the vice-chancellor of the University of Durban-Westville [University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa], which was the Indian university.  We came through and, you know, me being the vice provost of minority affairs, they wanted me to come up and meet him.  And we started talking about education there, and I started thinking about education back in Louisiana and stuff, and I saw the similarities.  I said, "We should go to South Africa."  And so, I got a group of folks--the dean of, the head of the Center for Afro-American Studies, the vice president for international affairs, myself, my wife, and a South African student by the name of Moffet Magany [ph.].  We went, and when they found that we were going--the university had awarded Mr. Mandela [Nelson Mandela] an honorary doctorate in absentia, the first time they'd ever done that, the university had ever done that, because they said they don't usually give them.  I said, "Well, it's not like the man chose not to come.  He was in prison, he can't come."  So, we presented him with his degree, and we went to a number of the HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] in South Africa, and some of the white universities, and starting seeing how we could begin to develop some programs.  And we began to get some relationships, and we got the South Africa Initiative Office.  And when I retired, they named a fund to keep this program going for myself and for my wife.
Speaker 2: Now, what does the South Africa Initiative Office do, actually?
Speaker 1: Well, we, they sponsor seminars; they have exchange programs between students and faculty from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] to South Africa, and vice versa.  It's like a home away from home for South African students who happen to be here, you know, at the university.  We developed some real good relationships academically, and some real good personal friendships.  It's still going strong.
Speaker 2: Now there's, it seems to me that there's a singular kind of--I don't think it exists in any other part of the country other than in Michigan, I mean, in the way it does.  You've got the African studies department at the University of Michigan, which used to be run by Ali Mazrui.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's one of the strongest African studies department in the country.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: You had, Congressman Charles Diggs was in charge of the African committee in Congress, the Congressional Subcommittee on Africa, which is a very strong subcommittee, until he was out of [U.S.] Congress.  John Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers Jr.] is very strong on that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you've got, I mean it seems like the Initiative's got a lot of--there's an initiative out of Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to South Africa--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --under [HistoryMaker] Robert Green.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I just talked about that yesterday with him.  And I mean, what, am I right about that?
Speaker 1: Well, I think, I think so.  You know, I guess the people just happen to be there, or the people just--who're interested in it felt maybe some support and some--but they weren't out there by themselves.
Speaker 2: Now, were you part of Nelson Mandela's visit in '91 [sic. 1990] when he came to Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 1: No, no.  No, I went, my wife and I went to that, but we were just sitting in the stadium like everybody else.  But I got a chance in '92 [1992] to sit with him and meet with him.  We had, my wife videotaped all of that, got pictures of it.  She wrote four books about our trips to South Africa.  And he's a powerful man.  I don't get in awe of many people or many things, but he's awesome.  And after meeting him, I told my wife, "I will never complain about anything else again, if this man can give up twenty-seven years of his life and not come out bitter."  And I think that was a stroke of genius.  Because I think people, whites, were expecting him and hoping that he would come out bitter and talk about one bullet, one gun, or--no, no, because they would have wiped him out.  He comes out and says, "Hey, what are we going to do to build a new South Africa?"  That wasn't what they expected.  You know, I told my wife, I said, "I don't have anything to complain about."
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, now, that was 1991 when this initiative started?  And how long did you stay with it in South Africa now?
Speaker 1: Well, I stayed until I retired in '96 [1996].  But I came back for about a year before I moved here and worked at a--consulting with them.
Story_ID: 296184
Speaker 1: How did you wind up moving to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Las Vegas [Nevada]?
Speaker 1: Las Vegas.
Speaker 2: Well, my wife [Christella Moody] and I, we--and I'm going to be very honest with you.  After the fourth shovel, one a day, my wife came in with a shovel, a snow shovel.  And she said, "I'm moving to Vegas.  You can come with me, or you can stay here.  You can sell the house, or whatever.  But I'm going to Vegas, and I'm not shoveling anymore."  That was her third time shoveling that day, with all the snow.  But we had--we always came back to Vegas when we would come to visit.  We looked around Biloxi [Mississippi] and all around the Gulf Coast, Mobile [Alabama], but growing up in Louisiana, I knew that humidity.  And I'm not sure whether it would have been a culture shock, you know.  So, but here, we moved here, and we love it.  I mean I do, I love it.  And my health has really improved.  I work out twice a week with a personal trainer.  I play eighteen holes of golf every Tuesday.  I get a massage on Thursday.  We go to things--I mean, it's--and nobody cares about what you used to do in your other life.  And they're not worried about whether or not they got alphabets behind their name, or--you're just a person, and if they like you, they like you.
Story_ID: 296185
Speaker 1: One thing I didn't ask you about that's critical I guess to--I mean that people would be interested in hearing about--would be your relationship to, I mean how you felt about the affirmative action squabble at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] a couple years ago when President [George Walker] Bush and others were--
Speaker 2: Oh, I thought it was a smokescreen.  But see, there's a difference between affirmative action and acting affirmatively.  And I think the university over the past years was trying to act affirmatively.  But you see, one of the things that--let me say it like this.  I think the greatest power in the world is the power to define terms, you see.  And people count and put affirmative action in a connotation, so when-'cause when I used to teach, I used to ask my kids, "When you hear the word affirmative action, what's the first thing that comes to your mind?"  "Lowering the standards, unqualified blacks taking the place of more qualified whites," a whole litany of stuff.  And I used to say to people, "Now, every year, somewhere between fifteen and sixteen thousand students apply for four thousand spaces in the freshman class at Michigan.  Now, are you telling me that four hundred black kids who are admitted can keep out twelve thousand white kids who didn't get admitted?  Do you ever think that it's possible that a less qualified white boy took your son or daughter's place?  Are you trying to convince me that every white student that applies to the University of Michigan is exactly the same qualified?  There's no difference in any of the test scores?  There's no difference in any of the grades?  So, when are you going to stop and think that maybe they're less qualified?  Not every black student that comes and gets into Michigan is a 2.0 and an 800 on the SAT.  You have black students with 1400s and 1500s and 4.1s.  So, you have to get that kind of thinking out of your mind.  But it's easier to do that and to talk about affirmative action or reverse discrimination."  I say, "Now when you say reverse discrimination, you must mean that it was some discrimination before, right, to reverse it?  Now, so, so does this institution discriminate?  What about the time when there was a quota?"  I said, "What I used to love to do is walk down the halls in the schools and colleges of this university and look at the pictures, starting from the beginning.  And you've been in business a long time before you saw any black faces, and then you saw one or two.  Do you mean to tell me that out of all the black folks that apply every year, they didn't have any more than one?  That wasn't by accident; that was by design."  So, when you start talking about this affirmative action, see, they didn't count any notion about overcoming past discrimination and segregation.  They wanted what?  Diversity, right, that neutral term that allows you not to have to talk about your past discrimination and segregation.
Story_ID: 296186
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question and it's--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes?  That we will look back and look forward, and be proud to think of what we've done in such a short time.  Eighteen sixty-five, 1865, you know, I have lived more years since the emancipation than was the number of years between my birth year and the emancipation. So, you know, we're not talking about eons, we're talking 1865.  And what is this, 2004?  What's that, a hundred and thirty-nine years? Now, see, we're going to have to start celebrating our achievements, and not let people define us as some hopeless group of folks that ain't nothing but failures, and ain't done nothing, and contributed nothing.  And we buy into that.  We have to define ourselves.  I tell you, the greatest power in the world is the power to define terms.  If I define you as nothing and can get you to buy it, it's nothing.  If somebody had defined--whoever came up with this idea of what you're doing, that this is nothing, and had the resources to get it out there, then this would be nothing.  I mean, a hundred and thirty-nine years.  Now, name any other group that comes under all the conditions that we've dealt with, and done the things that we've done.  I don't apologize to anybody.  You know, I remember when I first moved to Ann Arbor [Michigan], the guys used to call me Mr. Jefferson, Mr. George Jefferson.  I told them one day, I said, "Look, let me tell you guys something."  I said, "I'm not apologizing to anybody for living better today than I did fifty years ago or sixty years ago, when I was sleeping four in the bed with my brothers in Louisiana.  If I'm not living any better than that, then my neighbors, my parents [Rosetta Hall Moody and James Moody], my older brothers and everybody wasted money and time on me.  Now, you made a decision, and I made a decision.  I made a decision that college and education was important to me.  You made a decision that the poolroom or whatever you did.  You're not going to hang any guilt on me for your decisions."  And I used to tell my boy that.  "You make any decision you want, son, but you have to live with the consequences of that decision.  You're not going to hang any guilt on me about your decisions.  If I make it, then that's it."  And we've got to stop letting people define us.
Story_ID: 296187
Speaker 1: When you look back at your career, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No, you know, I--my wife [Christella Moody] and I, we sit and lay and talk about that.  I don't think there's anything that I would do differently in my life, in my career, I really don't.  I think, I think I've done the best I could.  I gave it my best shot.  Again, with serendipity--when I got out of the [U.S.] Army looking for housing--I told you that earlier.  I went down, they'd just opened up the projects [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois] on, off the Dan Ryan [Expressway].  I went down to the housing office downtown, and sat down with this lady and said, "I want to apply to get a place in the projects."  She looked at me, and we talked.  And I told her I'd just got out of the Army, and I was an officer.  She looked at me, and she said, "Sir, I'm not going to give you an application; I'm not going to give you an application.  You don't want to do this."  And I almost cried.  I went home and I told my wife about that.  And, but you know, I don't know that lady's name, and she may never see this.  But I want to thank that lady for not giving me an application to move in the projects.  I don't know what my life would have been, or my sons' or my wife's, if she had given me that application and I had got accepted.  But no, I would not do anything differently.  I gave it my best shot, and that's all I could do.
Story_ID: 296188
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, when you look at your vitae, I mean you're, you're like at speaking engagement after speaking engagement, and article after article you've written.  You've done quite a bit, as you've just described. It-it--what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy would be that I helped some folks, and I was encouraging to some people, and I was kind to some people.  And my wife [Christella Moody] and I, we talk about some of the kids we've helped, and some of the people we've helped.  A young lady was speaking yesterday down at the NCAAP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] thing in Tampa [Florida].  She got her Ph.D. from Michigan.  And she said, "You don't know how many lives you've touched.  But mine was one that you touched, and I appreciate it."  And that is my legacy, that I tried to help somebody; that I've tried to live a Christian life, a Godly life; that I've not tried to hurt anybody, not tried to be mean to anybody.  I've tried to be the best father I could be, and the best husband I could be; the best brother, uncle.  I just, I just, I just feel good that I gave it my best shot.  And if I helped somebody, I'm happy.  But I hope I haven't hurt anybody.
Story_ID: 296189
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Rosetta Hall Moody and James Moody] feel about your success?  Did they--
Speaker 2: Oh, they were, they were proud of all of us.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's so many in your family.
Speaker 2: They were proud of all of us.  And like I say, they loved us like we needed it.  And whatever success we had, they celebrated it.  They loved it, they enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, like I say, my dad and my mother, they were good people.  And my mother could be counted on by the neighbors, whether it was giving somebody an insulin shot, or delivering a baby, or just sitting down with somebody and listening.  My dad he loved to walk.  There were jokes about my father.  He never owned a car, and he'd be walking to one of the schools ten, twelve miles away.  And somebody would pass him in a car, and they'd say, "Professor, you want a ride?"  He'd say, "No, I'm in a hurry."  (Laughter) Yeah, I mean, so--but he was talkative.  He never drank, but he'd stop outside the bar, inside the bar, whatever.  But he loved to talk to people.  And if we traveled, he would always want to ask us about people.  Because his thing was, people are basically the same wherever you find them.  And they were, they were, they were proud of us, each one of us.  And each one of us brought pride and happiness.  My mother used to say to us, "When you get grown, you don't owe me nothing; just don't cost me nothing.  Just live a life that will not bring shame."
Speaker 1: The last question is how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Just like what I said about my legacy.  I'd like to be remembered as somebody that tried to help; somebody that did the best that they could with the limited talents and ability that they had.  That's all.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 295131
Speaker 1: Okay, could you go ahead and tell us about this one.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is Mr. Nelson Mandela, myself, and--I'm blanking on the boy's--Earl Lewis.  We were, had just awarded Mr. Mandela his honorary doctorate degree in his office, at the ANC [African National Congress] office in Johannesburg [South Africa].
Speaker 1: Okay, about what year was this?
Speaker 2: That was '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were there in '92 [1992], right?
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 1: Ninety-one [1991]?
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991], okay, '91 [1991], okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Tell us about this photo.
Speaker 1: That's after our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.  We renewed our vows at Bethel A.M.E. Church in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Speaker 2: Okay, twenty-five years, good.
Speaker 1: Twenty-five years, that was our wedding picture.  That was 1955, the wedding picture.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This one?
Speaker 1: That's Bill Clinton, well, President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton, and Senator Hillary [Rodham] Clinton and myself.  They were, this was when he first passed through Michigan when he was campaigning for president the first time.
