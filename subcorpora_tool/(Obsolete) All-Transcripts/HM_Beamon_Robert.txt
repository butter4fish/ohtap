Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one of my--okay. "You have to keep going until you get it right."  That's one of my favorite phrases.
Story_ID: 16380
Speaker 1: Now, we're going to start out, and I'd like to have you give your mother's name and also tell what you know about her and her background.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Naomi. Maiden name is Brown. Was married into the Beamon family, and she died at the age of twenty-five of tuberculosis, and one month later, they found a cure for tuberculosis. So she missed out by a month. That could have possibly saved her.  I don't know that much about her because she was--I was eleven months old when she passed away, so I get bits and pieces of stories from relatives that somewhat know who she was, and my uncle, which is her brother, talked a little bit about her.
Speaker 1: What about your father? Give his name.
Speaker 2: I don't really know his name because they say he was a rolling stone, so I have no idea where he last laid his hat.
Speaker 1: Talk about who raised you, the woman you refer to as Mom.
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother actually was my stepfather's mother that actually took care of me and pretty much guided me until I got myself in trouble, and then I had to somewhat straighten myself out because she could only do but so much. It had to be me to really come out of this negative phobia of whatever was going on at the time.  So my grandmother--her name is Minnie Beamon, and she was pretty much the backbone of the family.
Speaker 1: Also, can you give your stepfather's name and what you know about him?
Speaker 2: James Beamon, and I have good and bad feelings for him. I guess most kids growing up usually have good and bad feelings about parents because sometimes we feel that they don't know what they're talking about or whatever, but in my case, I guess he was kind of a traveling kind of salesman, and he basically didn't sell anything except for himself, and he had a way with women that, I guess in most cases, excited them, and so probably if you talk about a traveling salesman, probably his sales were to females and having a good time until later down the road in his life, where he just dedicated himself to himself and his wife. And so that I take my hat off to because he became very sensible and a very pleasant man to know and to want to be around. He didn't have that much education but was a very wise person. With that much wisdom, we kind of wanted to know why it wasn't always there for him.  But, again, life is a very interesting. Life, I mean it's kind of like you travel a very interesting road this way and you go this way, and you go up this way, and you come back down this way. And so it's kind of--it gets very interesting. It never stops until you just can't--you have no ability to understand what you're doing or getting ready to check out and go on to another life. So in essence, he had some incredible--he had an incredible style of life in terms of wisdom, but at the same time, he was very destructive, too.
Story_ID: 16381
Speaker 1: Now, Bob, and I--like I said, I really appreciated reading your book, but I want you to talk about your early years, of what your early, earliest memories were of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't feel that I had a very good upbringing, and the reasons for that is I spent about seven or eight years in Harlem [New York, New York] in a home with other kids.  Basically, I couldn't go back home because my mother [Naomi Brown Beamon] had had an affair while she was married to James Beamon, while he was serving time in prison.  And so basically what happened was when he got out, he did not want her to have me around, and so she had to really kind of hide me. And at the same time, she was very sick during those eleven months.  And so she had another son [Andrew Beamon] that was older than I was, about five years, that was with him, gave birth, and that was his son. That basically--that whole thing was very strange, where she had one son in Harlem, then one son in Queens [New York, New York], and so she was basically torn between the two of trying to get to see me. And so those seven years were really years of trying to understand why I was in this home and that every parent would come and pick up their kids at the end of the weekend and I was still there.  So I learned to deal with it, and so those seven years, to me, were very critical, so I really had nobody.  No one hugged me. No one kissed me. No one did this. And so it was--it could've been emotional.  I didn't understand what it was. And then again, it could be non-emotional, so I guess it was right in the middle, you know, depending on what day it was. And so I became very interested, that is, in finding out who my parents were, and they said that my mother had passed away. And I always thought that my stepfather was my real father. And during those years, from eight years old, they managed to bring me back to the family setting where James Beamon was living, and he sort of, I think, kind of resented me those early years, and then at my seventeenth year, he finally told me that, "There's no way that I could've been your father because I was serving time in prison," and that was my seventeenth year.  And I remember him being--he had been drinking quite a bit, and then he came in and said, "I'm not your father," in a sense, and I was shocked, but for some reason, there was some inner strength in me, and I guess I kind of got it over the years of learning to survive by yourself emotionally.  And so I hurt for a minute, and I continued to move on. And from seventeen on, I really felt motivated to continue to have this strength from within to do a lot of other things in life. And so I think that the early years were very critical for me. Living in Harlem, I had a great aunt, which was my mother's aunt.  She was very sad that she could not find me because they kept me hidden away. And so she wanted to take me after my mother had passed away.  She wanted to meet, and so I kind of disappeared. And then after talking to her just a couple of years ago, I find out that her brother had a big store around the corner in Harlem, and so we were so close, the family was so close, but yet so far.  And my understanding that we also had family that owned Small's Paradise [Harlem nightclub], and my family originally is from Charleston [South Carolina], and they are from the Small's family, which is a huge family that migrated to New York probably in the early 1900s. And so I've been on the go trying to understand a lot more about the family. I actually don't really know much about even James Beamon that much.  Grandmother [Minnie Beamon] didn't speak much about her family, and he never really did a lot of communicating about himself. And I've seen him two or three times spend time in prison.  And so I think by watching some of those things, I got early education. I got an early education on, you know, the good, bad, and the evil, that kind of thing, and I think that there are some basic things that I understood, which was common sense, you know. When you put your hand in the fire, you get burned, so I don't like getting burned, so I'm going to find another way.  And so I think I've used a very--used a natural kind of instinct to beget my own guidance, and so what you see right now is what you get. This is truly me. And that's kind of like an early childhood in my relationship to him.
Story_ID: 16382
Speaker 1: Well, I--So who in your early years, Bob, who were your role models and what were you sort of taking in as a young child?
Speaker 2: Well, my role models were pimps, hustlers. Didn't know much about sports heroes, other than white sports heroes, and those guys were baseball players. Didn't know much about basketball until nine, ten, eleven, and I liked the game. I started to like the game. But heroes in the community were limited.  I guess the closest to heroes were people that I hung out with or people that lived in the projects with me, where I would say, "Well, I want to be a good guy like this," or "I like the way this guy's mother or father react to him or her and would like someday that, you know, I get that kind of treatment too from somebody."  So heroes were very limited. Watched TV [television]. They were pretty much white heroes for the general public.  We had probably one black show on, which was 'Amos and Andy,' and I listened to 'Amos and Andy,' from radio to television, and I'm not sure if those were heroes or just basically comedians.  And they may have portrayed to people and to other ethnic groups or to other groups a very negative kind of thought about black people.  And so I didn't particularly like the show, but it was the only show that had brown people on, and so a lot of people think that that's the way all black people think and act, and so, you know, it was not until later on down the road that black people kind of were portrayed in many, many ways. So heroes were something that I didn't pay close attention to.  I had a reading and writing problem, and I never knew what all of these things were all about. And at some point, I really didn't even care.
Speaker 1: When you look back on yourself, do you think you were pretty sad at the time?
Speaker 2: Probably, you know, you go through life situations and--being a kid--being a child, you pretty much don't know what is your problem, if you have one, and many times, you know, we could be the worst things on the street, and we say, "Man, I don't have a problem."  So I didn't have my--I didn't think that I had problems, at least in my book, and that's why I had a difficult time adjusting to school and probably dealing with people in a sense.
Story_ID: 16383
Speaker 1: Are there any other stories you'd like to tell just about your childhood. Anything that, you know, come to mind, friends, events, anything?
Speaker 2: Example?
Speaker 1: Well, no, I don't mean--give me the name of your first school.
Speaker 2: First school was PS40-something, PS46 [Public School 46, Arthur Tappan Elementary School, New York, New York], or something like that. I can't remember.  And that was a very interesting period. I think I was in the kindergarten, first grade, and maybe second grade, and when we moved to the projects--we were in a house at the time, but we moved into the projects. Then I transferred to another school, which was PS160 [Public School 160, Walter Francis Bishop Elementary School, Jamaica, New York]. So I think I went there from--let's see, I was eight.  I must've been in the second or third grade, probably third grade. You wanted to know?
Speaker 1: I was just wondering about the--I was asking about the school, but then you were starting to go on and talk about that period.
Speaker 2: The first year in there--I think it was kindergarten--I brought--they asked me to--they have a little project called "Show and Tell," and I brought--for my "Show and Tell," I brought my grandfather's gun and bullets and knife to school, and immediately it was like people--the teacher took me out but took me to the office. I didn't go to school for a while, and I really never knew about what that was all about. I mean now I know what it's all about, but back then, I was home from school, and I thought that was very interesting.  So, again, there was no real guidance, you know, just basically on my own.
Speaker 1: You said that no one even explained to you that--you know, you knew that something--did you know something was wrong, or were you--I mean the teachers never explained? You sort of just of got whisked off, but did you see the alarm in their face and didn't understand it or did you know? Because you said even when you were at home, no one really explained to you why you were home. Did they say, "How could you have done that?" or "You embarrassed us," or none of that?
Speaker 2: Just very quiet, just--see, you have to understand that, you know, you had a man [James Beamon, his stepfather] in there that probably resented every day that I was in the house, and if it wasn't for my grandmother [Minnie Beamon], I'd probably--God knows what would've happened.  And so she was a working domestic person, and she probably took care of the entire family, including him. So it was quite interesting that no one never said.  So, as I said, I grew up with my own values, my own thought patterns, you know, so I had to take care of my own self. I had to put something together for myself, so I had to learn the good old-fashioned way, learn by doing.
Speaker 1: And people's responses to your doing?
Speaker 2: Early on, they responded very scare-, you know--they were, you know, I guess, bringing those kinds of things to school. Not only were--.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were saying that you didn't--so when it came time to go back to school, what was that? No one explained. How long were you out, do you think?
Speaker 2: I have no idea, but it was--it had to be for at least a week or so. I just--I mean it could be longer, but I know that I was out for a while.
Speaker 1: And your grandmother never said--.
Speaker 2: No one never said one word to me.
Speaker 1: They probably were embarrassed, a little bit. Do you ever think about that?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She might have been, maybe. I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, we're talking about six years old, five or six years old, so that's, what, 1949 or 1950, 1951, somewhere around there. You never know how black people really felt--I don't know how they really felt back then, but that could raise a question, you know, well, they had--they could've felt embarrassed or because of my situation, they just didn't know what to say.
Speaker 1: Now, when you got back to school, what were people's responses? The kids, you said, treated you--sort of put you aside or--.
Speaker 2: Well, I think during that time, those years, you know, five, six, seven, eight years old, we as kids can be very mean to each other, and not knowing the extent of damage that could be done. My feeling was that kids were--some kids were very nasty, and I probably had a complex about my weight and about how I looked and that kind of stayed with me into middle school...
Story_ID: 16384
Speaker 1: Now, so you were saying that [at age] five, six, seven, eight, that you were conscious of your weight and your clothes. And I just want you to--you know, you--.
Speaker 2: What I mean by conscious of my weight, you know, they would call me 'Skinny' or they would, "You're wearing your parents' clothes," or something like that because they were oversized or whatever. And so I think those things hurt. I just felt out of place for a while, but, again, those years can be critical in terms of how you start shaping your life and things like this here, but I was determined to be somebody or to--something was coming, you know. It was a wild undertaking, but I managed to survive that very early on. Well, I managed to survive those beginning steps in life.
Speaker 1: So was there anything that happened at eight besides--it was that whole escapade--well, you tell this. I don't know if it had--but with the local whore, you know, the one where you guys sort of gang-raped her--not gang raped her, you--what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't a gang rape. It was a woman that was in the basement, and she was a very loose woman in the neighborhood, and she happened to be in the basement where nobody really comes. We just so happened to find her. And she was asking us to make love to her, and so it was quite an experience.
Speaker 1: So it was a chance for little boys to experiment?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So basically what you'd describe your early years, that you really had--.
Speaker 2: Actually, at eight years old, I was drinking and smoking, so it was--you know, I was kind of grown--well, not grown, but, you know, I thought I was--adult.  So those things, drinking and smoking, I related to being an adult. So, sorry, but--
Speaker 1: But this was really no different than lots of people in your neighborhood really.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, you said that some of your favorite shows were 'Ozzie and Harriet' and 'Leave it to Beaver' and the 'Ed Sullivan Show' and things like that. And so TV [television] was like--I remember when I was young, you know, I sat and watched--now that I think about it, I watched a lot of TV. I would sit down for hours. And so that reminded me--you know, your saying that reminded me of mine, my growing up. I was living with my grandmother. She didn't know any better. And so I just sat and watched hours and hours of television. But what other things--you know, you talk about--well, let's see, up to eight years old, what happened at eight? Was there anything that happened at eight--because you were still pretty much like--well, I mean you were sort of running the streets, you know, experiencing the streets with your friends. I know that at thirteen--well, let's see, eight to thirteen, what happened during that time period?
Speaker 2: I think, you know, the numbers eight to thirteen, I think that I really got involved with gangs, became a war counselor, and I was just ridiculous in school.  I was having sex with girls in the closet in the school. I was just ridiculous. I was so bad that they had to--actually, they wanted to send me up the river until I was twenty-one, and I had to go to court and get this thing straightened out. And I believe that the girl--actually, they wanted to probably press charges against me for what I did to--you know, I beat somebody bad in a classroom and just terrorized people and things like this here. And so they had enough, and they sent me to an alternative school. I ended up going to court, and they gave me one last chance, and that was to go to an alternative school, and I think that happened when I was fourteen, fifteen years old, somewhere around there. And I spent almost two years there, and--I got a lot of discipline. There were guys that were much bigger than me.  There were some males there that were two hundred fifty pounds, six foot four, you know, giants, and so I learned to respect these guys. School was--they could do a lot more in school than they can now by making you understand what they're trying to say. When talking didn't work, you know, they went to work in another fashion, and it hurt.  And so as I said, I got the message quickly and understood the kinds of people that I was dealing with, you know, hustlers, pimps, and all kind of, you know, drug dealers, everything was there, you know, including a couple guys that had probably murdered a couple of people, and we managed--well, I wouldn't say murdered--attempted murder or something like that, that they actually had done some time and then let them out and have them come to an alternative school. So I was dealing with these kinds of people, and I was very much convinced that I didn't want to be there, and I had  to find some meaningful way to come--to get out of this thing, and that's when I did very well in sports, where I started--I jumped twenty-nine feet--excuse me, I jumped twenty-four feet one inch in the Junior Olympics and set a Junior Olympic record which took me to another level, you know, picture in the paper and, you know, all the high schools like, you know, were interested in me.  I went to one particular school, and my stepfather [James Beamon] went with me because I think he was, at that time, really proud that I did something. I told him I wanted to go back to regular school.  I didn't want to go to the alternative school anymore, and was there any way that we could get this done. And so that happened. There was a track coach there by the name of Larry Ellis that was also Dean of Men that I brought this picture,  which was a full page of me in the--at the time was the 'New York Mirror' [newspaper] in the sports section. And I was so excited, and when I gave him this picture, he just--his eyes just lit up like a Christmas tree, and a way he kind of ran/walked to the principal's office and said that we'd like--"I'd like to admit him into the school, and we'd like to take a chance with him."  And from that point on, it was just a wonderful experience school at Jamaica High School [Jamaica, New York].
Story_ID: 16385
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back. The school that you got sent to was PS600, right?
Speaker 2: Six twenty-two [Public School number 622, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Six twenty-two, okay. And how are you saying--how were the kids there any different than the ones that you were experiencing on the street, and why did you decide that this was not what you--you know, that you didn't really sort of fit?
Speaker 2: Well, I was becoming more interested in basketball and running track, and so I used those kinds of things to stay away from the crime or criminal activities.  And--so I got so involved in sports that I stayed away from doing criminal activity. So it was then that I just started to feel that I had to make some kind of adjustment in my life.  I didn't fully go straight, you know. I had some fallbacks and, you know, some--I had some character building, some things that I had to feel very good about myself in order to move forth.
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of the teachers that influenced you there?
Speaker 2: I was probably--my track coach, Larry Ellis [at Jamaica High School, Jamaica, New York], and there was an English teacher there. I would think that those were my two--and her name was Miss Carlucci--so there were a couple of people I thought were very significant in that area.
Speaker 1: Was Hilty--there was also a Hilton--
Speaker 2: My basketball coach, yeah. He was pretty cool.
Speaker 1: But Larry Ellis was even more important?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 16386
Speaker 1: And I want to go back just a little bit before we go on to Jamaica High School [Jamaica, New York] and that was with your whole experience with Bre--was it Bray, Braw?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we called him 'Bro.'
Speaker 1: Bro?
Speaker 2: Right. We called him 'Brother' [Patterson], but we called him--.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. Okay. And his mother, Mrs. Patterson, right?  And I want you to talk about that because also music had become a big love of yours, and this was a little earlier, you know, especially the congas [drums], playing the congas. And I just want you to talk about that a little bit.
Speaker 2: Well, I must have been ten, nine or ten, and I had one Saturday morning I was awakened by some sounds of timbales and congas. Basically, I didn't even know what they were, but the sounds were so incredible that I just was so amazed at the sound--I loved the sound--and that every beat was--how do you put it?--sounded very syncopated, and each hit from the drum was--each rhythm was--each time it was hit, it was in rhythm. It was right in place.  And I said I wanted to get me some bongos and play with these guys one day. And I did get a pair of bongos, but it was so tragic what happened to my bongos was that we made--in order to get your skin on your drums to change the tone, you used a lighter or some fire to warm them up and little did I know--I guess I must've had them for about three or four months, and one time I was rubbing them, and it got so hot that the skin burst. So that was very, very hurting for me.  And then later on as I got older, I became even more interested, and I started to play with this dance company, and it was Bernice Johnson, which I think probably now, she's probably one of the great ones, along with Katherine Dunham, right, a very highly respected person in the world of dance.  And then I used to play with a gentleman by the name of Raleigh Hall. That was very inspirational to me, and every time I see him, I tell him how much he played an important role in straightening out part of my life and to give me some goals that I wanted to play just like him. And I ended up playing with him at Bernice Johnson and Dance School [Bernice Johnson Cultural Arts Center, Jamaica, Queens, New York]. And there was another person that was in there.  I think his name was Lester [Wilson]--became a very famous choreographer, Lester, oh gosh, I'm going to have to--he passed away, but he was one of the best. He was the choreographer for many of the TV [television] shows and Broadway [New York, New York] shows. Grew up in my neighborhood and very close friends to my family.  So I was surrounded by incredible people, artists, I started to look for, and then my friend Brother Patterson came in the picture with his mother and her two daughters, where I used to come over after every school day and go up there, and we'd have--she would fix food for all of us, and I'd sometimes stay overnight. And Bro [Brother Patterson] and I, we had a lot of things in common, and music was one, and we used to play, play the drums together.  We used to listen to jazz. That's where I was really introduced into the jazz world. We used to play Gene Ammons. He's also a Chicago [Illinois] guy. And we used to love putting him on.  We used to enjoy [Maxwell] Max Roach and all those great drummers, and we wanted to emulate these guys, and I then started playing for Bernice Johnson's dance class.  I never did play for a show, but I played with [James Hawthorne] Chief Bey, which was one of the exciting drummers that were playing with big bands, as well as the African groups.  And so that excited me quite a bit, and my next-door neighbor in the projects that played was also encouraging me. His name was David Coppa, and he could--he played with three drums, and I said, you know, I'm going to play like that one of these days.  Very, very awesome player. I mean he was incredible. My family on my mother's side were also very talented.  My cousin Buzzy was singing with The Five Sharps, which sang 'Stormy Weather,' which is the original 'Stormy Weather' in rock n' roll.  And some of my other neighbors were The Cleftones that sang 'Heart and Soul,' 'The Little Girl of Mine,' and 'I Love You--' you know, '--For Sentimental Reasons.'  These people were just all around me with so much talent Shep and The Limelights. All these guys lived in the projects. You know, just an abundance in the heartbeat.  I mean this was a time to want to associate, and myself and Bro, we listened and we observed people.  And from that point on, it's always been with me. I have right now probably about four to five thousand albums anywhere dated from the early 1900s, when they first got out there, to the present day. So I'm a connoisseur of music and all kinds of music. Classical, be-bop, whatever you want, I have it. And coming to my house, I like to kind of take some of those out. People really enjoy that stuff.
Speaker 1: So, Bob, what does music mean to you? Why the attraction? What does it do to you when you hear it?
Speaker 2: I hear a lot of things. I mean I hear contentment, excitement.  It's emotional. You could cry. You could laugh. You could dance.  You know, you can listen. You can emulate artists. You can get ideas from them. It doesn't necessarily have to be music of ideas. It could be artistic designs or whatever. The music takes you on a magic carpet ride.
Story_ID: 16387
Speaker 1: Now, when did you realize you first had talent? It was before Jamaica High [School, Jamaica, New York], wasn't it, when you were just playing basketball?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't really--.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: I mean I did something. I jumped twenty-four feet one inch, but yet growing up, you know, you don't, at least I didn't, look at it as having talent.  I said, well, you know, I might be able to win a couple of track meets, but, you know, I might be able to play a little bit basketball. But overall, I think most kids don't--well, I didn't grow up with a big head in terms of my talent, and so I always thought that there was somebody out there better than me, and so I was always thinking, "Well,  gotta get my act together because somebody's going to get me, going to beat me."  So that's the kind of attitude I had. I didn't--even though when looking back at it, I was really far ahead in terms of my ability, but that's something that didn't hit me then. And if it had hit me, it just would've just kind of like--because I was always in fear of somebody beating me. And so--and even today, you know, I have that same kind of style.
Speaker 1: So when you went to Jamaica High School, that was a turning point in many ways, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was basically the turning point, and--
Speaker 1: But it was motivated by you. You said you wanted to go to a regular high school, not a special school?
Speaker 2: Right. Actually, I wasn't getting anywhere in the other school, you know, in terms of grade or, you know, graduating. Well, actually, the school was designed for kids to go back, but many of them never did go back.  But I was determined to find my place under the sun to do something and possibly get back to school, so that was my note to go and say, "I want to go back to school by jumping and winning in the Junior Olympics."
Speaker 1: And so when you get back to regular school, you learn that really you can't read, right?
Speaker 2: Right. Well, prior to Jamaica High School, I couldn't really read or write, and my stepfather [James Beamon] helped me to be on my way. I guess I was about fourteen, and it just seemed that it was easy for me to catch on.  And so I just kind of like--I guess the way you told me, I became a--he was very aggressive in how he taught, you know, "Better get it right," that kind of thing, you know.  Slapped me upside my head, you know, "Get this thing right."  So he was kind of like impatient, in a sense, so you had to get this thing right or you'd be sitting at the table all night 'til you get it right. That was very interesting, too.
Speaker 1: So it was--well, this sounds--I don't know, sometimes in the black family, you know--anyway, "Boy you better sit up there."
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.
Speaker 1: Anyway, you were named also, right, All-American in track and field?
Speaker 2: Yes. I was All-American and Honorable Mention, All-City, for a couple of years there.  Let me see. I made All American my junior year, I believe, and Honorable Mention, All-City and I played along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar [formerly Lew Alcindor] and those guys. Some of the guys that I played along with made the pros, and some went on to college and did very well, won national champions and stuff like that. So I was in good company on the guys that we played with.
Speaker 1: Were they in school with you? They weren't in that high school, though, were--?
Speaker 2: No, no, Kareem, he was at Power Memorial [High School, New York, New York].  That's not existing anymore, but he and another guy named Pee Wee Kirkland--Pee Wee Kirkland and, let me see, [Nathaniel] Nate Archibald came a little bit after me, after I left, but he was one of the key people. Let me see, Earl Manigoat, 'The Goat,' they all came up during my time.  And so I was in good company with great competition. These guys, are legends, and still people--Raving, talking about these guys. And so I feel very privileged to have had the opportunity to play during that period of time because there's some great athletes that came out.
Story_ID: 16388
Speaker 1: Now, I want you to talk about the day that--so you're, you're, you're--you now have changed.  You, you have changed from that eight-year-old--I mean when you start winning competitions and things and having your na-, you know, pictures in the newspaper, sort of popularity comes along, doesn't it. You're not--right? In the school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you're popular now.
Speaker 2: Ah, well, that's what they say, but, you know, I'm--.
Speaker 1: But, no, I mean you feel better about things, right?  It's not like you're the skinny kid who--that doesn't have clothes matching.  In fact, you, you had said your, your grandmother [Minnie Beamon] had to start buy-, you know, had been able to buy better clothes.
Speaker 2: Well, she bought what she could, you know.  I didn't have the penny loafers or the--I, I was okay, you know.  I didn't really have the clothes, but whatever I had, I guess it was okay.  I was more into the sport than into the clothes at the time, but I had a good eye for looking at clothes, you know.  And I had a friend that I used to borrow his stuff, you know, and he was one of the guys in New York that--he used to wear alligator shoes and had silk shirts, all kinds of incredible sweaters that--you know, he's the guy walking around with about a thousand dollars on his, on his body every day.  And sometimes I'd borrow some of his stuff.  It was like, you know, felt good when I had them on, you know.  So probably I felt a lot better that I was doing, I was doing better in terms of not looking for trouble.  You know, it was more or less staying out of trouble.  And those coaches were 100-percent behind me, so I just had a different kind of motivation then, and I wanted to kind of be somebody.  And then I made the All-American and All-City, became the athlete of the school, then set some high school records that basically still stand today, so (pause)--.
Speaker 1: The records that still are standing today.  Sorry--okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  The records that are standing today are the long jump.  The PSA (public school amateur) record is twenty-five [feet] three [inches].  It's still the longest.  And then I had another record, which was the triple jump--I'm not sure if that's still around.  But I made All-American in the triple jump, and I should've made it in both, but I didn't.  And I was very excited about it.  Made Honorable Mention All-City, and, of course, the women were surrounding me with "Oohs and ahs," and that kind of thing.  And it wasn't, it wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be.  I mean I thought, you know, women would be able to soothe my soul in terms of the "Oohs and ahs," but then you kind of look at it, "Well, why is this girl, you know, ooh and ah-ing about me? Because I play basketball, or does she want me for myself?"  You know, those are the kinds of the things that were going on in my mind.  So I enjoyed it, and then I didn't enjoy it, and I kind of--I only dated one girl at Jamaica High School [Jamaica, New York], my first, my first love.  She was the girl that I wanted to marry.  You know, I wanted to--boy, it was like, you know, I'd stand in my mirror at the house, and I would talk to her about how I felt about her, but when I'd get with her, I couldn't never say two words.  So I had a lot of respect for my mirror (laughs).  The mirror got me ready, and every day I would be in the mirror, and every day I would tell myself that "This is what you need to say to your girlfriend," and that, you know, "She's going to be your girlfriend for the rest of your life," or "You're gonna be my wife, gonna to have children."  And she was so crazy about me, and then she dropped me, and I didn't really date until my senior year, and that was kind of like I wasn't really there because I graduated six months ahead of time.  So I went right off to college, and I was going with this other girl, and it was kind of like long distance, but my first love was just really--she was really quite a gal.
Speaker 1: Her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Rhonda Finney, and quite an attractive woman.
Story_ID: 16389
Speaker 1: Now, talk about also, the day that the olympians came to school [Jamaica High School, Jamaica, New York], you know, the--Ralph Boston and Donna--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, during the summer, I believe it was my sixteenth--fifteenth or sixteenth year, and during summer program--they had this program called 'Operation Champ,' and they would--these celebrities would move around and talk about their experiences, and we had three.  One was Donna de Varona, Ralph Boston, and Wilma Rudolph.  And I wasn't really that impressed with Ralph Boston or Donna de Varona.  I was more impressed, I was more impressed with Donna de Varona than Wilma Rudolph and Ralph Boston because I couldn't swim, and she was a swimming gold medalist, and I was like--and stayed on the track and getting track stuff.  I ran in and got some information from Donna de Varona about swimming, and I still didn't learn how to swim, and I came back out, and they were talking about the Olympic experience, you know.  They had these USA uniforms on.  I said, "Me, I'm gonna get me one of those."  This was probably around 1964, the summer of sixty--well, it was right after the Olympic games, probably September, getting close to school.  And they were very exciting to me, and I said, "One of these days, I'm going to get one of those uniforms."  And I did.
Story_ID: 16390
Speaker 1: And let's talk about that.  So how does, how does--I mean saying that you want to do it and doing it are two separate things.  So did you discuss that with--was it Ellis?  Who, who did you disclose your ambitions to that you wanted to compete in the Olympics or you wanted to get one of those uniforms?
Speaker 2: Who's Ellis?
Speaker 1: Was it James Ellis?  Wasn't he?  No.
Speaker 2: Larry Ellis?
Speaker 1: Larry Ellis, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Well, I think that he knew that I had the ability to perform at a very high level in that if I stuck with it, there's the possibility that I could've made--I could make the team, I could make the team.  And I had a very good--junior year [at Jamaica High School, Jamaica, New York], I jumped twenty-five [feet] six [inches] and broke the National Schoolboy [worldwide competition] triple jump record.  And so I had some great--I had a very good year that year, and people were saying, you know, "If he ever was to put a one single jump together, that God knows what this guy could do."  And so I had just that kind of raw talent that people were seeing something very special.  And at that time, I still didn't know that I had that kind of talent.  And so I worked at it, and he worked at my technique, and after I made All-American, I got scholarships to college, and that was great because I was, first of all, probably the first--I was the first in my family to graduate from col-, from high school.  But to get offered a scholarship in college, that was just, whew, wow, just on another level.  And I was happy as much as I was--I was sad as much as I was happy because I felt that college--I may have--could've failed in college because, you know, here I am with deficiencies in many of my subjects, coming in from 600 school [Public School number 622, New York, New York], and what would it look like on my transcript, things like this.  So I was worried about that.  But there were schools that accepted me and accepted me on probation.  And my first school was North Carolina A&T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], and I was very disappointed with the school because they had--they did not have coaching, they didn't have a coach that could actually help me.  And so I transferred to the University of Texas at El Paso [Texas] with Wayne Vandenberg, and that's where I think I developed into an athlete that I pictured myself to be one day.  And 1967, I became the top long jumper in the country, and so I had an incredible winning streak, and then up to the Olympic games, I did--I had--was seated as number one and with the possibilities of not winning anything because of the problems that I had making the preliminaries.  But I managed to--I pulled one out on my first jump, and that was a very important day, October 18, and I tell you, I haven't had a peak experience in sports after that.  But that's fine with me because peak experiences come and go, and that all you need is one.  You don't need two.  You don't need three.  But getting to the top is very important.  And on that day, I was the best in the world.
Story_ID: 16391
Speaker 1: Was your training such that there--was he [Wayne Vandenberg]--'cause you--you describe in this book as sort of all over the place, you know, and that you had a lot of black athletes there [at the University of Texas at El Paso], you know, in this old country town, southern country town, right?
Speaker 2: El Paso [Texas]?
Speaker 1: Right, El Paso.  And that was a culture shock experience for you in some respects, right?  Being there, no?
Speaker 2: It was a culture shock.  I mean I hadn't--I mean I actually had no place to compare really, but it was a shock to see big weeds rolling down the street when the wind blows and to see people talk with a twang, to see racism, to see a basketball team that's made up of pretty much black athletes that won a national basketball championship in an all-white setting.  Was very interesting.  I mean in a sense where you look at these athletes, these black athletes, you would think that the school could've been predominantly black in a sense, but the shock was was that it was almost all white, Mexican, also.  And we had a lot of unity, we had a lot of fun, and some of the guys are still my friends today.  And we lost our scholarships by boycotting Brigham Young [University, Provo, Utah] because of their practices back then.  There were no actually blacks there, if I recall, and that there was something about their religion [Mormonism] in terms of black people.  And so we lost our scholarships and from that point on, life changed in terms of education.  But I said, "You know, if I stay in this rut, I'm going to fail."  And I got a call from a friend, [Ronald] Ron Basil, which was at Jamaica High School [Queens, New York], that became a track coach at Adelphi University [Garden City, New York] and asked me if I'd like to attend his school.  I said,  "Absolutely."
Story_ID: 16392
Speaker 1: But you are skipping way ahead.  We've got to get you--you skipped--I mean you went to the Olympics quickly and then I was trying to get you--but I was asking you about the [Wayne] Vandenberg.  Was he a very good coach?  Would you consider him that, or were you just --?
Speaker 2: I think that his intentions were to--he was an incredible recruiter, and he was a Chicago [Illinois] boy, also, that grew up in Cicero [Illinois], that was an exception coming out of his area where he lived, which he was kind of like a white guy that was almost like a black person, in a sense.  He had this--you know, he could walk in any neighborhood.  He had no--he just was a human being that loved his business that he was in.  He had coaching abilities, but he was very well known for his recruiting.  He had recruited some of the great athletes that would've won many national championships afterwards, and the school got a name from, from us, the first group of athletes being there.  So I occasionally see him, and I think he's a incredible guy.
Story_ID: 16393
Speaker 1: But it was there.  That's from that--from University of [Texas at] El Paso, Texas that you competed.  That was at the time that you only competed for the Olympics, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  I--.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So how does that work?  How--you were training there, but that doesn't mean that you automatically can make the Olympic set.  Can you talk about that process that got you to, to Mexico?
Speaker 2: Well, there are some preliminary competitions that will qualify you to participate at the Olympic trials, and every one of the preliminary activities I won.  Competitions, I made the distance, which was twenty-five, twenty-five [feet] six [inches], I believe.  And from that point on, I was winning every major competition, and then I came back and won the Olympic trials.  And prior to going to the Mexico games, about a month before, we had another trials that I won, also, and I jumped twenty-seven [feet] six [inches].  And from that point on, I felt very, very confident that I was going to be the winner.  I had no doubt.  I had believed that those that have doubt about their ability have a lot of problems in the games.  And so I felt that I was well-prepared.  I was willing to jump in rain, snow, sleet.  Whatever it would take, I was going to win.  And so that day, October 18, 1968, I stood up at the runway, and I said that, "I'm not going to be denied being a champion on this day," and on my first jump, I jumped twenty-nine feet two-and-a-half inches.  And I think the moment that that happened and I found out that--you know, I said, you know, "Well, then what's the next thing that I'm going to do in life that's going to give me this kind of peak experience?"  And I've been searching ever since.
Story_ID: 16394
Speaker 1: But that was pretty amazing that you had not jumped that far yourself.  You were, you were--I mean there's that picture of you crying, you know, I mean, sort of in disbelief, right?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: And I know you've told the story, you know, how many--probably thousands of times, but I'm just wondering what--can you just recount on camera for us how you even felt at that point?
Speaker 2: I was between time and space.  There was no time to respond.  There was no time to react.  I just was in the midst somewhere that I can't comprehend.  It's not something you can describe.  It was just there that day.  It was that natural feeling of being everywhere, in particular, being at the [Olympic] games [in Mexico, 1968].  You know, after I jumped, I could hear the people yelling and screaming, but I--before that, it was just--I was just totally into this mindset.
Speaker 1: And you had started practicing visualization, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now they call it creative visualization, but you had practiced it.  You had read a book, I think, right, that had--I'm not sure, but what, what had made--what were you visualizing?  Were you visualizing--I mean, I know people--you know, people can make their bodies do amazing things.
Speaker 2: I was visualizing winning a gold medal, jumping to win--not to break any records, but to win--and standing up on the podium and receiving the highest amateur athlete award, which is a gold medal.  That was all I could see.  Those were what we call visualizations of where you see yourself.  Every day those things came up.  Every day I saw myself jumping into the pit, or I saw myself doing something special getting out of the pit and then I'm up on the stand getting my gold medal.  Those are the kind of things I saw.
Speaker 1: And they came true, everything.
Story_ID: 16395
Speaker 1: But it took like--it took twenty minutes for them to even--'cause can you just talk about that a little bit?  It took them twenty minutes to even determine because you went past what they thought was humanly possible?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had a measuring device, which was electronic.  It was on a pole, which would measure up to maybe about twenty-eight feet, one or two inches, and after I jumped, they kept looking into this scope, and they could not see the jump.  And so they were--the measuring device was actually too small, and so they had to come in with manual tape, and so that's when they measured the distance of eight meters ninety [centimeters], which is equivalent to twenty-nine feet two-and-a-half inches.  And that was really unheard of.  I had broken the Olympic record by three feet and broke the world record by almost two feet.  So as I had mentioned to you, I was between time and space, and I had gotten a gold medal, I had broken a world record that was--and then on top of that, I had gone way beyond the distance, so I was like, "Wow!"  So I was on cloud nine.  I had everything I wanted.
Speaker 1: At that moment.
Speaker 2: I had everything that I wanted for that event.
