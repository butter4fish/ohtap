My mother was twelve years old when she lost her, her mother, and she migrated from South Carolina, after her mother's passing, to New York City [New York, New York] to work, and lived with her sister.  Her sister's name was Aunt Sissy [ph.].  And she worked as a domesticated maid for--and she, she had a--after five years of living in New York City she had her first child and--which is my oldest sister right now, Essie Mae [Essie Mae Walton].

She had to walk with--many times with no shoes to go to school, and it was--schools were segregated back then, and she knew her father worked in the cotton fields to try to support the family, and--but it was a loving community, from what she told me; it was a loving community.  But with the unfortunate death of her mother at that time--she was twelve years old; pretty much things--she tried to find her independence, and her sister was willing to take her in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and she lived in New York (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay this is a time --
Speaker 2: I believe this was in 1932, and she was twelve years old.

Speaker 2: I don't recall my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] telling me stories, but my mother's father was a Indian [Native American]; he had a little bit of Indian in him, but I don't recall too many stories she telling me about slavery.  But she did work on--they did work on the cotton fields for, yeah, little or nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And times--you, you had a sense that times were not that good down there, you know, at least economically.

His father worked on a plantation as well, and to make ends meet, his mother--my grandmother--thought that it would be best for them to head north as well, so they moved to Philadelphia and migrated to Philadelphia, I believe, in 1935, from what I was told.  And from Philadelphia--they lived in Philadelphia for a good five, ten years after that, and they moved to Harlem, New York [New York] to try to get a piece of that Harlem Renaissance pie back then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or should I say be a part of it.
Speaker 1: Did they have any stories about the, the days in Harlem?

Story_ID: 626834
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: My mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] said they met--I believe she was working--she was doing domesticated work for a respected Jewish doctor, and he saw her walking to work and approached her, and one word led to the next, and he used to bring her flowers on his bicycle, and he captivated her heart and tried to show her the good life, but she was more into raising my oldest sister, Essie Mae [Essie Mae Walton], from her previous relationship ten years before and, and working.  Her responsibility was really not only tending to her daughter, my sister Essie Mae, but also fulfilling her responsibilities working for the doctor that she worked for.  But my dad [James Green] was able to swing her off her feet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they met what, around 1950?
Speaker 2: No, they met in--let's see '32 [1932]--late '40s [1940s], I'd say.
Speaker 1: Late '40s [1940s]?  Okay.

Speaker 2: He had an honorable discharge from an injury.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have any stories about the war?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was something that he didn't believe in at that time, but when, when he was en route, he sustained an injury that prevented him from fighting in the war, but no I didn't hear too many stories about that, other than the fact that he was disappointed that he got injured, and he didn't believe in--believe in the war at that time, but he was willing to go and sacrifice and fight for our country, 'til he got injured.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now what--a lot of--I've heard--I've talked to a lotta World War II [WWII] vets and stuff, and they have like stories about some of the things they didn't like in the, in the [U.S.] Army and, and the [U.S.] Navy as well.  Did he--is that, is that what you meant by he wasn't for it--in some of the ways he was treated?
Speaker 2: The way that we was treated back then--the fact of fighting a war to where we didn't have our freedom out here in the United States; he was against that, but he was willing to go and fight, but he--then again, on the other hand, he really didn't because he said, why should he fight for someone else's freedom and we didn't have our freedom here in the states at that time?
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But unfortunately, he got injured, so that prevented him from fighting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a story--that's a common analysis from some soldiers in those days that say that, and it's--of course, it's true.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Story_ID: 626836
Speaker 1: So that had to have been in the late '40s [1940s], so your parents--I guess they--yeah, they got together around--somewhere around '49 [1949] or '50 [1950], I guess, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About that, correct; that is correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So, did your dad [James Green] have a chance to--or your mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] have a chance to finish high school?
Speaker 2: My mother didn't, no; the furthest she went in school--I believe she didn't finish high school, my mother didn't.  My father did, my mother did not 'cause she was working trying to raise her kid--yeah, Essie Mae [Essie Mae Walton].  No, she didn't finish, and that was very disappointing to her from what she expressed to all of us.  And she wanted to make sure that we didn't do what she did as far as not finishing--getting her education.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are you, are you--are your parents tall?
Speaker 2: My mother was tall; she was 5'9"; my dad [James Green] was about 5'10", 5'11".  I think I got my height--my 6'9" frame from my mother's side; her father was about 6'4".  Back then, in those days, that was pretty--yeah, he was about 6'4".
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you're, you're, you're 6'9".
Speaker 2: I'm 6'9"; that is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are any of your brothers and sisters your, your height?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a brother that was about 6'5", and everyone else was over 6', so, you know--6'2", 6'1".

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you name them?  And like where do you fit in the order?

Story_ID: 626838
Speaker 1: When your parents [Lucretia Simmons Green and James Green] got married was, was your father still living in Harlem [New York, New York], or was your mother in Harlem or, or how did they--'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were living in Harlem, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is there a story about how they moved to Brooklyn or, or did they, did they--did--you grew up in Brooklyn, right?
Speaker 2: I was the only one that grew up in Brooklyn; everyone else was born and raised in Harlem (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So they stayed in Harlem for quite a while until--
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the reason why we moved to Brooklyn was because, you know, times was pretty hard and, you know, Dad wasn't holding up to his end at that time of being a responsible dad, and the city had to find another home for us, and my mother decided that she wanted to get out of Harlem at that time, and the city found her--relocated--found her a place in Brooklyn, New York.  She was pregnant with me; that was in 1960, and then I was born.  It was the summer of 1960; I was born that, that next year--January 4th of '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you only knew Brooklyn as a place to grow up 'cause you grew up there, you know.
Speaker 2: That's the only place I knew, Brooklyn; yeah, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Now, I think people from around the country, they think of New York [New York], they think--always think of Harlem, but Brooklyn is huge; I, I think Brooklyn's bigger than Chicago [Illinois], if you were to take it outta New York--that's what I read in a almanac (laughter) so I don't know if it's true, but it's a--it's huge; it's a big place.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--
Story_ID: 626839
Speaker 1: What was life like growing up for you?  I mean can you describe where you lived, and then what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, it was wonderful, you know.  My--I lived in a six--well, let me start from scratch.  Moving from Harlem [New York, New York] to Brooklyn [New York]--remember, we lived on Jerome Street in Brooklyn--East New York section of Brooklyn.  We lived on Jerome Street for about a, a year, and then my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] found a bigger apartment--bigger home for us--for nine of us that was living--well, it was ten of us that was living in a apartment; she found a six room apartment right around the corner on Pitkin Avenue, and I remember the story she told me.  She, she was walking and the then landlord was doing some work outside the apartment, and he had a sign, you know, "Apartment for Rent," and she inquired about it and he asked her how many kids she had, and she said this is the only time she ever had to tell a different story--I don't wanna use the other word but, but she said she had to because she needed a bigger place, so he asked her how many kids that she had, and she said four (laughter), and he said, "Okay."  And a few weeks after that, when we moved in, he noticed all the kids (laughter).  It was four plus six more, and he was like--saying something in Spanish; he said she did not wanna hear what he was asking her in Spanish 'cause he didn't speak English.  But his--the landlord wife told her, you know, that, you know, "I thought she said she only had four, and she bringing all these kids."  (Laughter) But he accepted her, but one thing my mother always did is she always paid her rent on time, and she always kept a clean apartment and kept us in a respectful way.  And after he saw my mother's characteristics on how she was raising us, he accepted her, and we wound up living there for seventeen years--eighteen years in that, in that apartment.
Speaker 1: Now this is--this is quite a job, you know, when you really think of--you know, when you reflect back on something like that.  There is someone who's working as a domestic--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and she's gotta feed what--nine children?  I mean she's got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was ten of us.
Speaker 1: Ten, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was ten (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--
Speaker 2: And my sister, my oldest sister [Essie Mae Walton], was living in the Bronx [New York]; she was married--she got married at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so she wasn't there to help.
Speaker 2: She wasn't there, no, so it was ten of us.
Speaker 1: So, this is, this is really a, a--she did a--you know--a job!
Speaker 2: I think she did a phenomenal job, the best that--she always said she did the best she could and, as I've told my family, you know, to this day, it was up to us to take it to another level for her, to make it better.  Unfortunately, some didn't--some decided to go a different route but, you know, she did a phenomenal job under the circumstances.
Speaker 1: Right.  And this is New York City [New York, New York] where you don't necessarily have like the, the village kind of, you know, situation you might have in South Carolina or someplace where there are other relatives always around, and people you know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, she, she did it--she did it on herself with her character, integrity, and she was able to win a lotta people over in regards on how she tried to raise us, and keep us all together.  And our, our closest friends was our landlord--the ones who--and also the one--the, the residents who lived on the sec- we lived on the third floor.  And also the surrounding neighborhood was, you know, a lotta Puerto Ricans, you know; they were our friends.  They really brought us in and, and accepted us and made us feel like, you know, we were part of their family as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, it was a lotta Puerto Ricans in the neighborhood where you grew up?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you learn how to speak Spanish?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I have a brother, I think, who--I wanna make sure (laughter)--Wilbert [Wilbert Green] is a--totally converted, and my brother Wilbert, he worked in a grocery store right downstairs and they, they brought him in like, like he was their family 'cause they liked him, and he wind up working in a grocery store, and learned how to speak Spanish better than how everyone else was speaking Spanish in the neighborhood, and to this day, we still, you know, say--kid him that he's a fully converted Puerto Rican, yeah so.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It's in, it's in his blood wholeheartedly.
Story_ID: 626840
Speaker 1: I asked these questions together, and I probably shouldn't have, but--so this is a six bedroom apartment you all are in?  I mean a six room apartment--six room, rather--
Speaker 2: That is correct (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not six bedroom; that would be--
Speaker 2: Six room.
Speaker 1: Six room.  And everybody--so how did--you know, like half boys and half girls--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So, how did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had bunk beds, bunk beds.  And, you know, we doubled up in beds, and my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] found a way to make sure we slept in a---not only in a bed, but in a clean bed, and made sure that, you know--yeah, she--there was only one, one time there was one, two, three--used to be like three, four of us in one bed at one time, yeah.  Yeah, it was, it was remarkable, but there was so much love and, you know, we saw the effort that my mother was making on trying to make it better and keep us happy.
Speaker 1: Now, did your older brothers and sisters have a lotta responsibility when your mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They have a--they had chores around the house, absolutely.  Around the house they had chores and responsibilities, and my mother made sure of that with love, and it was--you know, me being the baby, I was just observing, you know, and waiting for my time to come, as I continue to grow, but yeah, she had all kind of chores for all the brothers and sisters to do things to keep the house clean, and make sure that she washed the clothes to where when we go to school and our clothes was clean and, and respected.
Story_ID: 626841
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?  Like the first thing that you remember, or the oldest thing that you can remember?
Speaker 2: I remember when I was, I believe, two years old, when John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] got assassinated.  Everyone was in--at home crying.  It was a sad day.  I believe that was 1963.  I was two, yeah.  I remember that very vividly, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you have a sense of why people were upset about John Kennedy being assassinated?
Speaker 2: At that time, at two, no, but I remember the scenario.  I remember everyone was in tears in my house, and my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] on the phone talking to her relatives and, you know, just watching black and white TV and--of, of, of his assassination.  Yeah, I remember that very vividly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Others--move forward--I remember the assassination of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], 1968--I remember that.  There was violence--
Speaker 1: So you, you were eight then, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And--now, were there riots in Brooklyn [New York]?
Speaker 2: There was riots in Brooklyn, but not in my area--not in my neighborhood, not in East New York, but in Brooklyn--yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I remember certain areas in Brooklyn where we couldn't--we couldn't go past a certain area because they would chase us back to--you know, I remember Atlantic Avenue.  My mother always told my brothers and sisters, "Don't cross Atlantic Avenue because, unfortunately, there's ignorant people that don't accept us yet and, you know, we don't want you to get hurt or you to hurt anyone else."  And we used to call Atlantic Avenue, the Mason Dixon Line.  In Brooklyn, if you cross that line--if you cross that street, it--you know--and I remember a few times as I grew--when I was growing up, I used to go there, and just walk over there with my, with my Puerto Rican friends, and they used to chase us back.
Speaker 1: Okay--just testing the line (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Testing the line, yeah.
Story_ID: 626842
Speaker 1: All right, yes; can you go back over the list of your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Of my family, Essie Mae [Essie Mae Walton], and my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] waited ten years to, to have ten of us from my father [James Green].  Joe [Joseph Green] was my oldest brother, Teresa [Teresa Green], Nathaniel [Nathaniel Green], Clifford [Clifford Green], Deborah [Deborah Green Patterson], Janice [Janice Green Thorner], Wilbert [Wilbert Green], Bernard [Bernard Green], Rebecca [Rebecca Green], and myself.  So, it was ten of us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, that's ten.
Speaker 2: --after my sister Essie Mae.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's eleven altogether, right?
Speaker 2: Total of eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, as I said, Brooklyn's a huge place.  So, you all lived in a section called East New York [Brooklyn, New York]?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the racial balance?  I, I know you said a lot of people of Puerto Rican extraction there, but--so what was like the, the mix in East New York?  And who did you have to fear on the other side of Atlantic Avenue?
Speaker 2: I think it was the mixture of Italians and the Irish. Yeah, the Italians and the Irish had a huge population going towards Highland Park [Brooklyn, New York]--across Atlantic Avenue going to Highland Park, yeah.  And I remember there was a White Castle right there on Atlantic Avenue, and we couldn't go there at night time, you know, past--'cause they would chase us.  But the White Castle right there on Atlantic and Berriman [Street], and that's where--but the ratio, I would have to say, the mixture was Italians, the Irish, and there were some Germans that live in the, in the neighborhood; mostly it was those two.
Speaker 1: In your neighborhood, or in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In my neighborhood it was Puerto Ricans and blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, across Atlantic Avenue was Italians and the--
Speaker 2: Irish (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Irish and the Germans.
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, the White Castle was actually represented--a white castle (laughter) in some ways, I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was right there in between, right on Atlantic Avenue, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 626843
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, any other sights, and sounds, and smells?
Speaker 2: Sights?  Yeah, the peer pressure.  We can--I mean I don't know if you wanna talk about that now, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, just the peer pressure as I continue to mature and grow in that, in that neighborhood [East New York, Brooklyn, New York], but I remember the, the, the smell of the, of the food, the culture, the Puerto Rican heritage there.  Their food and, you know, combined with our food--the barbequing and--that was one--especially around Christmastime, you know; our Puerto Rican friends would drop off their favorite delicacies during the Puerto Ric- during the Christmas holidays, which is b'stillas and rice and beans, and my landlord used to bring some extra food up to my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] to, you know, assist her and help us out as well.  I remember those, those days and--yeah.  And my neighborhood at that time also was in the--you know, everybody just got along so well; there was no fighting, you know.  I'm talking about back in the early '60s [1960s], late '60s [1960s].  In the, in the '70s [1970s], that's when gangs were pretty much becoming prevalent in the neighborhoods.
Speaker 1: So you didn't--there weren't--there wasn't a gang presence there when you were a little kid.
Speaker 2: Not in the '60s [1960s], no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no, when I was a little kid, no.  I think in the '70s [1970s], early '70s [1970s], that's when it started getting prevalent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Ghetto Brothers--I remember the Tomahawks, the Mad Caps, you know.  Yeah, it was pretty prevalent, and either you had to be part of it or not, in some way.  I was able to not get involved and, you know, some of my friends did, and I was happy that I wasn't able to be part of all that that was taking place then.
Story_ID: 626844
Speaker 1: Were your brothers--well, you came from such a large family, I guess, were your brothers, I guess, a big influence on you growing up?
Speaker 2: A big influence.  I saw how they were living at that time, and how my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] try to keep us all together and, and keep them outta trouble, and for them to--and, you know, they're--and I'm thankful that they weren't part of any gangs or none of that; they weren't criminals.  But one thing I know my family didn't ever, ever wanna do is--we all saw how hard my mother worked to try to keep us together and make sure we go to school and get our education, and be the best that we can be.  One thing I'm so proud to say that neither one of us--my family members didn't wanna do anything to disappoint and hurt Mother, you know.  Personally, that was my--one of my biggest motivations and inspiration as well to, to do good and to make it better for her--make her life much better.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you get a--I guess you got a lot of advice, I guess from older brothers and sisters coming up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lot of advice, a lot of advice, a lotta love taps, you know.  I don't call it whooping--it was love taps, you know.  Whenever they saw me stepping outta line, if they had to, they would--you know; but it was for a reason, yeah.  The one thing that I have learned from them was, you know, the little slight mistakes that they were making, you know, that they wanted to make sure that I wouldn't do the same thing by making their mistakes, you know, the same mistakes that they would--they have done.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did anybody get in big trouble in your family when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, not big trouble, you know.  No, not big trouble, no--again, as I stated, we had no criminals in my family and, you know--one brother in particular maybe would, just to test the law, go on the trains, maybe, and do a little bit a jostling and, you know, he'd wind up paying the consequences of that, and I remember my mother running back and forth, you know, to court.  But, you know, jostling on the subways and--but that primarily was, was it.  No, no criminals in my family that got into deep trouble.
Story_ID: 626845
Speaker 1: Now, what did you like to do as a, as a kid growing up?
Speaker 2: As a kid?  Being since I have five sisters (laughter)--four living with us and--I used to try to hear things what they were doing, and go back and tell my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] what they were talking about (laughter).  I used to like to be around them until they, until they find out Mom find out--found out certain things what they were--you know, about boys, you know--nothing bad.  And I used to like to double jump with them, you know--double jump ropes with them, and I used to get jealous when their little boyfriends used to come around and, you know.  But my brother Joe [Joseph Green], he was a major, major influence on me.  He was a schoolyard legend--basketball player, and he had unbelievable talents on the, on the court.  He was--from what I'm told, he was a dynamic schoolyard legend back in Brooklyn [New York] and, unfortunately, he didn't stay as focused on his, on his basketball and on his studies to take it to the next level, you know--college--and it was one player, one NBA player--college player that's from my neighborhood, Jim McMillian.  He went to Columbia University [New York, New York], played for the Lakers; he was from my neighborhood, and him and Joe used to have some big battles in the schoolyard and we used to--and my brother always shared this with me.  You look at Jim McMillian, you look at my brother, Jim McMillian did it the right way far as staying focused on his studies, going to college and going to the NBA [National Basketball Association], and unfortunately, my brother, he went the wrong route, he got unfocused.  And he always used to tell me wine, womens and songs got to him, to where it didn't get to Jim McMillian and, you know--
Speaker 1: Jim McMillian, he went on to play with--was it Portland, or, or--
Speaker 2: He played with, he played with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I believe he played with the Knicks [New York Knicks] for a little while as well, but he was right from--I remember him, when I was a kid, coming up to the house and my mother feeding him.  He used to love my mother's beans, you know, and collard greens.  And his nickname was Big Man; they used to call him, Big Man.  But anyway, my brother looked at that scenario (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm getting him mixed up with the guard that played for Portland.  I think it's, it's a--so this is the big Jim McMillian that's--
Speaker 2: The big Jim McMillian that played with the Lakers back in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: He about 6'10" or something, or--
Speaker 2: Jim McMillian is 6'5".
Speaker 1: 6'5"?
Speaker 2: 6'6".
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear), okay, okay.  I've got him mixed up with another one.
Speaker 2: There was a Tom McMillen [Charles Thomas McMillen] that played in the NBA; he went to Maryland [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: 6'11"--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --left handed.  He was the senator.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there was another McMillan [Nate McMillan] that played for the Seattle SuperSonics that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, that's the one I'm thinking about--the guard, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the Portland--he was the Portland Trail Blazers' coach (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, coach, right, right (unclear).
Speaker 2: --but they released him about a month ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway, my brother used to compare, you know, both lifestyles and, unfortunately, he didn't, you know, stick to it like how Jim did and, you know, the girls and, you know, started hanging out and just got untracked.  And Jim did it the right way, he said, and he looked at me of not making that same mistake that he did, so he kept me focused, and always reminded me to stay focused on my studies, convinced me to not play baseball--just concentrate on one sport, 'cause I loved baseball back then also.  I was a, I was a baseball junkie, to tell you the--figuratively speaking, and I loved baseball and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you--what position did you play?
Speaker 2: First base.
Speaker 1: First--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And as I started growing this way (gesture), he said, "Brother, you know, you should concentrate on one, and I think, I think you got something good there, playing this game of basketball, and you should focus on one; all that energy you putting on baseball, put it on two things--you study and, and basketball," which I did.
Story_ID: 626846
Speaker 1: It was the year of 1978--just to jump a little; 1978 we--I was going on my senior year in high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York], and I talked to him that night.  He was, he was--me and my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] spoke to him.  He was coming by the house to see us before he head back home to his, and that opportune- that chance never took place 'cause he got murdered and, you know--we spoke to him at about five, six o'clock, and we waited 'til 'bout nine or ten o'clock and my mother said, "Where is Joe [Joseph Green] at?"  And at about 10:30 or 11:00, we got a knock on the door from a detective, and someone took his life from us--shot him in the head, set him up, man.  I think that was the turning point in my life right there--yeah.  I would have to say this--yeah, that was the turning point that just blew me away 'cause we had big plans together of getting Moms out, you know.  Our objective--his dream--my objective was to get Mother outta the ghetto; buy her a house.  And me and him had a fun bet, you know, like a dollar bet, you know--who gone be the first one, 'cause he was going to school--John Jay [John Jay College of Criminal Justice, New York, New York]--and when they took his life away, that devastated Ma, and I tell kids to this day, that's the saddest thing anyone could put on their parents--put that stress and pressure for their parents to put their kids away.  So, after that unfortunate experience I had, that just enabled me even more to apply myself more into my studies and to this gift that was given to me of playing this game of basketball.
Speaker 2: So he was trying to really make a comeback in some ways.  He's going to school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was a disabled veteran, and his friends thought he was carrying one of his monthly checks and--yeah, 'cause he was in a--he was in the [U.S.] Army, and he had an honorable discharge also.  And, you know, actually, we almost lost--'cause he fell off a jeep and had a major concu- he was in Germany and he was, he was--you know, as my mother said, "He almost was gone," and he was about--he had a good 85, 90 percent recovery; he was getting back into his--and then when that happened it just stopped everything; I think that devastated our whole family.  And, you know, being young--seventeen years old, my first impulse was to go on, seek revenge, and--but through the grace of God and my mother and my high school coach, I'm glad I didn't do it.  As my mother said, "Turn that into a positive 'cause if you go out and seek revenge on someone, on your brother's death--on your brother's killing, all that gonna do is put you behind bars, and we'll put you at six feet underground like where he's at." Just--and I heard her, but then again there was so much anger in me back then, and I wanted to just seek revenge.  My high school coach really--he--you know, he sat me down and just grilled me and told me, "Don't do it," you know; "Just apply it to what the Lord have blessed you with.  Get your mother outta here." And--which I was able to do.
Speaker 2: Now, did they catch who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They catch the three guys; it was three guys that he--that knew him and, you know, they claim that it--that the gun went off by mistake but, you know, my brother was the type that would give you his last dollar.  The witnesses that saw the, the incident they said, you know, once he turned around and saw who it was, that's when they capped him--that's when they shot him.  And, yeah, that was a major turning point in my life.
Story_ID: 626847
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit to growing up.  Now, you--growing up in New York [New York], you were, I guess, about eleven or twelve when the Knicks [New York Knicks] won the NBA [National Basketball Association] championship, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So, I wanna ask you about that 'cause, you know, that's a--probably--did, did you see yourself at that time like--you know, as part of something like that in the future?
Speaker 2: I remember watching a game with my brother, absolutely--watching the Knicks--Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, Earl "The Pearl" [Earl Monroe], the great Red Holzman.  I remember we used to sit and watch it and say, "Wow," and I remember, you know, I used to--after watching the Knicks play, I used to go out and try to emulate the, the, the best player from that game that I saw, you know; one day I'd be Walt Frazier, next day I'd be the Pearl in the schoolyard doing all kind of moves--uncanny moves; next day I'd be Willis Reed, the--you know, it was a--yeah, back then it was my dream for me to be an NBA player.  I said I always wanna to play for the Knicks, and be like them.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know Rodney James Parker?
Speaker 2: I knew Rodney Parker extremely well.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us about him and what his significance was in the community and in the basketball community (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Rodney Parker was great; he was--actually, he tried to help my brother [Joseph Green] when he saw my brother going off that different path that--you know, going off that line.  And again, when I say path, I'm talking about, you know, when he wasn't as focused--staying focused on his studies and not--you know, going to parties and all that.  So he tried to help my brother big time, but when he (laughter) had heard that I was the next up and coming, he kind of like took me under his wings, kind of like--by sharing stories with me about, you know, my brother--how great he was, and if he would've just stuck to it, and how great Jim McMillian was, and other great players in the neighborhood back then when my brother was coming up.
Story_ID: 626848
Speaker 1: You know, he [Rodney Parker] told me stories about one of my heroes back in the neighborhood in schoolyard basketball, James "Fly"--Fly Williams.  Fly Williams, I--you know, I thought he was the best basketball player I ever saw play at that time.
Speaker 2: Now, that's somebody--people don't talk about it that much anymore, but I remember James "Fly" Williams from the tournament one year.  He came up with Austin Peay [Austin Peay State University, Clarksville, Tennessee], or some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Austin Peay.
Speaker 2: It's a little school, and they won game after game in the tournament; they went further than anybody thought they would--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and he had a--he was famous for wearing the same pair of Converse--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --even though they were worn down, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I mean what--can you tell us a little bit about that?  I, I don't--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, he used to wear the same shoes all the time; that was his superstition, and he--I'm a tell you about Fly; he was one of the--he was just incredible.  I remember when I was a kid, I used to watch him play, and he used to leave at halftime and score fifty points, you know, had like forty-five, fifty points, and then at halftime we all sitting in the stands waiting for Fly to come back out with his team, and they said he had to leave.  And at that time, I didn't know what was going on, I'm a kid in--you know.  He had to go.
Speaker 2: Is this a high school game?  Is this a street game (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, this summer league, summer league game, summer league game.
Speaker 2: Summer league.  He had to leave?
Speaker 1: He had to leave.
Speaker 2: So he--
Speaker 1: And (laughter), you know, they say he had to leave and take care of some business.  I didn't know what business that was back then like, you know, I'm a kid, you know.  The business that he was taking care of back then was, you know, wheeling and dealing out there, but--when he used to do that, we all used to say, "Wow!"  The whole crowd used to just leave when he'd leave 'cause we've always wanted to see him play, but he was just a remarkable player, a remarkable player.  And I remember one time in high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York], he came to my high school game to watch us play Boys Heights--Boys High [Boys High School; Boys and Girls High School, Brooklyn, New York], and he walked in the gym and they had to stop the game 'cause he walked in with his fur coat and (laughter)--now he didn't really mean or want to stop 'cause there was only one way to get in, from the fans, and he had to walk across the court and they had a seat in the stand waiting for him--for him and his guests and boy, I was just--I marveled at that.  I wasn't upset 'cause I said, "Fly Williams coming to see me play," you know; that was--and here I used to watch him play when I was a kid.
Speaker 2: Now, did, did Fly--now, explain this.  Now, I, I know when I was, I guess, a teenager, I started reading about the Rucker League and all that and, and that's not the same set, but there's a--I started to realize that there's a culture of street basketball in--on the East Coast that is not replicated in the Midwest at all.  I mean as a--in the Midwest, if you're a high school star, you know, you're--you, you get some attention, but if you don't make it to high--you know, if you don't really become a high school star, nobody pays any attention to you that much--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but on the East Coast you can become a playground star--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and be big--bigger than the high school guys on some--you know, depending on--is that true?
Speaker 1: That is true; back then, correct.  It's not like that now, in this day and age.  I think basketball in New York City [New York, New York] is so much different now than it was back then, and I'm talking 'bout back when I was coming up in the '70s [1970s] or '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: So--'cause Fly--was he a high school star at all?  I mean did he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was, he was a high school star.  I believe he went to James Madison High School in Brooklyn [New York].  He was a high--he was a phenomenal player; he was--he just did all kind of things on the court.  He was a--to me, in my eyes--and I share this with kids--he was what Michael Jordan was to us when Michael Jordan first came--hit the NBA [National Basketball Association].  And I tell kids to this day, "I knew many Michael Jordans in my neighborhood, and one name in particular is Fly Williams."  He was--in my eyes, he was the best.  And there was great players also, besides Fly, but Fly, I thought--and to this day when I see him--if I'm in Brooklyn and I happen to see him 'cause he works, I believe, in the BRC--Brownsville recreational center [Brownsville Recreation Center, Brooklyn, New York]--does some advisory work there, which is great.  He touching lives for the--of the kids in that neighborhood.  To this day, when I see him, I get--I pay him my homage; I say, "My legend, my idol, Fly, how you doing?"  And, you know, we talk, and he, he just was a phenomenal player--all the uncanny moves, his shot.  But he had a--you know, he had a different attitude for the game, and I think that's what hampered him of being a true legend in the NBA-ABA [American Basketball Association] as well, 'cause back then he played for the ABA when he was drafted outta college.
Story_ID: 626849
Speaker 1: In those days, though--now, I've heard about this to some extent in Chicago [Illinois] but not--it's not the same level, but I don't think it is on the East Coast, but you can actually make money playing basketball on the street.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about that.
Speaker 1: You don't know anything?
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about that, no.  What I know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.  I heard a guy, you know--well, in the '90s [1990s] I know there were some guys on the West Side here in Chicago who set up a little stadium next to--in a, in a vacant lot, and people were betting on the game--you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, see, I don't know (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: You see, and that's why I say basketball is not like how it was back then when I was--we played for the love of the game--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the love of money was not a--we never thought about--you know, of course, the ultimate was for, for us to be an NBA [National Basketball Association] player, but far as getting money on a side a bit, we never--no, no, no.
Speaker 1: So, guys like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think in my neighborhood, people would get beat up--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, if they ever talk about, you know, throwing a game and all that--that, that never entered our mind; we played the game for--one, for competition--who was better, and for the talking and outta respect of the--you know, who's the talk in the neighborhood?  Who kicked who's butt?  So where we can talk and put 'em on a throne.  No, we never played for the money.
Speaker 1: Well, I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's one thing what Rodney Parker was fantastic about also.  Rodney, he worked for various--not worked, but he did some work for various shoe companies and he used to come in there, and if he had extra shoes in his car, he would gi- I remember 'cause he gave 'em to me many times, you know, "Sidney [HistoryMaker Sidney Green], what size you wear?"  I said, "Oh, you know, right now, I wear size ten."  (Laughter), "Well, I got some--here," you know; "Go on, go on and enjoy yourself."  And he'd give me new pairs of shoes, like "Wow! Thanks, Rodney."  And I used to wear those shoes out for--to get better on that basketball court in the schoolyard.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, it must have been expensive to clothe you 'cause you--you're growing so fast.  As you said, you're ten right now but, you know, what size do you wear now?
Speaker 2: I wear fourteens now.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, so you're constantly growing outta shoes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, it was tough, you know; that's another great, remarkable upbringing that my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] did for us, especially me in particular 'cause I, I wore a lotta hand me down clothes.  You know, being the baby of the family and, you know, my brothers--I remember wearing my brothers' clothes, you know, when they couldn't--when they couldn't fit 'em anymore; they got tired of it, hand 'em right down to me, and my mother used to be in the kitchen to hem 'em up, or bring 'em in and, you know, it was a--that was remarkable.
Story_ID: 626850
Speaker 1: Now, what was--where did you--well, let's see, maybe we should finish about Rodney Parker, but I probably need to go back to grade school.  Where did you start grade school?
Speaker 2: My grade school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: P.S. 158 [P.S. 158, Warwick School, Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  P.S. 158.
Speaker 2: Right around the corner from us (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed it immensely.  I had one teacher in particular that really took a personal liking to me and I, I went to pre-kindergarten.  She was my teacher; she made sure that I was at--I mean she was my teacher; I, I was her student--she made sure I was her student in kindergarten, first grade, second grade and third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you started (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She had a major impact on me.  I will never forget her.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Miss Fuller--Margaret Fuller [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember when I played for the Knicks [New York Knicks], I went public saying, "If there's Margaret--Miss Fuller, if you're out there, please contact me through the Knicks or--I wanna see you and give you season tickets--you and your family," and--never, never happened, but she was great, she took a personal liking to me and it was wonder- she used to pick me up on weekends and take me to the museums, which my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] couldn't do, take me to the zoo.  I remember (laughter) one Saturday she came and picked me up; this was when I was in the third grade, in the third grade and she--I found out the week before she took one a my other classmates to the zoo and she didn't take me; she didn't come and get me (laughter).  So that next week, she came and--wanted to take me to the museum and I told my mother I didn't wanna go.  And then she said that Miss Fuller was startled like, "Why he don't wanna go?"  My mother told Miss Fuller for some reason why, and then I gave in and said, "Because she took Kenneth [ph.] last week.  Tell her to take Kenneth."  And Miss Fuller cried in my apartment (laughter).  That broke my heart, but I wound up--I, I didn't go that week, but that next week I did go.  But she, she, she was a major influence on me.  She taught me how, how--taught me how to read and write; she started it off for me.
Speaker 1: That's remarkable; that's really--that's--a, a teacher, you know, has that kind of impact.  She must have been a special teacher then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very special teacher.  P.S. 158, Miss Margaret Fuller--if she should ever see this, or her family.
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen her again since you've been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never saw her again after, after my junior, junior high school [I.S. 302, Rafael Cordero School, Brooklyn, New York]--I never saw her again.
Story_ID: 626851
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: My favorite subject was reading.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I loved to read.  Second favorite subject, which--history, social studies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I liked reading about historical events and people.  I'm not gonna tell you the ones I didn't like, but I say those two was my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did--were they teaching black history in the schools?
Speaker 2: Back then, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, nope.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wondered.  When you were, I guess, about eight or nine years old, that's when the--like black cultural arts movement really kind of started up, or I think.  Did you, did you notice that at the time--around the time that King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed?  And was there a black (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the civil rights era, yeah.  Actually, I remember it, I recall this very vividly, speaking of King again.  This was in April or March.  It was the month of March 'cause it happened a few weeks after.  They had Dr. Martin Luther King on TV, we was watching TV and my dad [James Green]--we was in the kitchen and my dad said, "That man don't--."  He, he meant--he was talking to my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green], and as a kid, you know, I'm all ears.  He say, "If that man don't get, you know, protection, someone's gonna, gonna kill him," you know.  And lo and behold, a week or two after that, you know, April 4th, on my father's birthday, he got assassinated.  Yeah, you know.  So--and I don't know if my dad had a premonition or--when he said that--and he got killed on his birthday, April 4th, 1968.  But I remember, you know, Malcolm X, you know; they assassinated him in the Audubon Ballroom [New York, New York], and my dad grew up maybe about five or six blocks from the Audubon Ballroom back in nine--you know, and--I believe Malcolm X got assassinated in 1965, '66 [1966], '65 [1965]?
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965], right.
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) you were a little kid then.
Speaker 2: I was a little kid; I remember when that happened also, yeah, when they assassinated him, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, you know, the--I guess the talk about Malcolm X grew; it just kept going on, even though he was assassinated.  It's a--became a--you know, a kind of--part of New York [New York] culture and, and--well, around the rest of the country, as well, and people--some say Malcolm X is bigger now than he was when he was alive, in some ways (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: Did you go to middle school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  Junior High School 1--I.S. 302 [I.S. 302, Rafael Cordero School, Brooklyn, New York], Intermediate School, I.S. 302.
Speaker 1: 302, okay.  And--okay, these are neighborhood schools, right?
Speaker 2: Neighborhood schools, correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--now did you--did your--did you become interested in anything else in, in junior high school that you weren't interested in in elementary school [P.S. 158, Warwick School, Brooklyn, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was playing basketball in--that's the--that was the year--those--that was the years when I was pretty much focused on, starting to get more focused on basketball, but I still was playing baseball with my neighborhood friends.
Story_ID: 626853
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were you playing organized baseball then as, as a middle schooler--a junior high schooler [at I.S. 302, Rafael Cordero School, Brooklyn, New York]?
Speaker 2: I was playing (laughter)--it was organized.  There was a team in our neighborhood called, the Sidney All-Stars--not for me, matter of--but it was so ironic.  And I remember me and my Puerto Rican friends didn't have enough money really to chip in so we can have our uniforms, so we decided to--instead of, you know, just form our own team, and we bought our own shirts, you know, The Scorpions [ph.].  And we would play other neighborhoods in Brooklyn [New York], you know.  Either go to their place, or they come to us.
Speaker 1: Was it organized as a league? You know, or some--
Speaker 2: It wasn't really organized as a league; we just--just for bragging rights, just like how we used to do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so just the kids?
Speaker 2: The kids; we organized it, yeah.  Yeah, the parents, they put--you know, now the, the parents would come out and cheer for their kid and--just to have something to do, and just bragging rights, you know.  "We, we beat such and such neighborhood," and--yeah.
Story_ID: 626854
Speaker 1: What about basketball?  Did, did--what was your first experience with actually a organized basketball team?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a start back with my eighth grade, my eighth grade; yeah, it was the eighth grade.  I, I got transferred over to--from I.S. 302 [I.S. 302, Rafael Cordero School, Brooklyn, New York] I went to P.S. 64 [Brooklyn, New York] because of a little incident that took place in my--in I.S. 302.
Speaker 1: What happened (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's too tantalizing to pass up when you said that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, this is the truth; I'm glad everything is okay now but, you know, my first girlfriend--I was just real crazy about this girl in the neighborhood, and my teacher in one of my classes was absent, so we had a substitute teacher and she had a substitute teacher, so I wanted to sit in her class and talk with her and do some work, and her substitute teacher asked for me to, you know, to leave--to go to my class and--which was right next door and, you know, it didn't take place and I got--he was over physical with me and, you know--and he was big and strong; I remember this so vividly, and to protect myself, I took a window pole and just--to heed him off me and as he was coming towards me, the window pole got hooked in his nose and just, you know, ripped his nose a little, and I was so scared--it's the first time ever.  And I got called down to the principal's office, called my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green], my mother had to come and get me, and had to report the incident, et cetera, et cetera, and so I had to transfer from that school because all the talk that was going on what took place, and I went to 64-P.S. 64, and I was assigned a probation officer, and this probation officer convinced me to--he said he had a basketball team in Brownsville [Brooklyn, New York] that he'd like for me to play for, and obviously to keep me going, keep me--you know, that summer, and I really didn't want to, but he convinced me and he gave me my first uniform.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: And I, I was always tall for my height and--for my age, and that's when I first started playing organized basketball, and I believe I was thirteen years old.
Speaker 1: Hm, okay.
Speaker 2: And his name--I remember his name very vividly 'cause he, he had another--he's another person that had an impact on my life--John McBride [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I remember when I--just to jump a little bit, when I played for the Knicks [New York Knicks], he was another person I personally called and extended him season tickets 'cause he put me in the scenario--in the situation where I could be successful, and he helped me build up more confidence in myself for playing basketball--that was my first ever uniform.
Story_ID: 626855
Speaker 1: But jump--you know, word got--you know, word got in the neighborhood that I was playing basketball and I was growing and, well, you know, thirteen years old, like 6'3", 6'4" and everybody wanted me, and this one particular coach in the neighborhood on Shepherd Avenue named Ducky [ph.], he--it was the Falcons--the Shepherd Falcons [ph.]--he convinced me to play on his team that, that summer--no, that next summer.
Speaker 2: Now was that a--like a city league for kids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was a city--for citywide tournament--
Speaker 2: Okay uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and he got us in a lot of tournaments, but one thing I loved about him is that he spent time with me and educate me about the game of basketball and how to be tough on a court.  And being since I was a big guy--the biggest guy, he ingrained in me of what a--what is expected, how I should be on a court when I step in between those lines and, you know, how to be a man and, you know, people won't laugh at me because I couldn't do the things that they expect of--with my height.  But I played with him and he gave me--you know, he helped build my confidence also, you know, John McBride [ph.] and Ducky from the Shepherd Falcons.  And then this one particular coach, Gil Reynolds, who coached Fly Williams [James "Fly" Williams], who coached Bernard King and Albert King.  About a year after that, I was told that I need to play for him because Gil Reynolds can teach you the fundamentals--what he taught Bernard King, Albert King and Fly Williams, and all the other great neighborhood ballplayers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bernard King is--was really--
Speaker 1: Oh, he was incredible, yeah.  Albert King, I think, was the best high school player I ever saw play--next to my son [Taurean Green] (laughter).  I thought my--but Albert King was my other childhood idol in high school.
Speaker 2: So he taught Fly Williams, Bernard King and Albert King.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah--Gil Reynolds, and he was incredible (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, see, Albert King--outside of New York [New York] we, we don't know much about Albert King--
Speaker 1: Oh, Albert was phenomenal.
Speaker 2: --but what you're telling me--
Speaker 1: Aww, he was a phenomenal high school player, oh! Ah!
Speaker 2: Everybody knows Bernard King from the Knicks [New York Knicks], you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bernard was great.  In my eyes, I thought Albert was just unbelievable, you know.  I used to watch him and say, "Wow!"  And, and I got an opportunity to play against him my junior year [at Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York], and it was a citywide tournament at St. John's Recreation Center [Brooklyn, New York] and I was scared; I couldn't sleep at all that night before, after I found out I was playing against him.  And just outta fear on the tap--on the jump board, I beat him for the jump, and after I beat him for the jump, you know, a little confidence came in me and I, I had a good game against--and we won--my team won.  And after that, that's when my confidence just went outta the window in perspectives, but I was just like if I'd done that to Albert King--I had like maybe nineteen points--seventeen--seventeen points and he had--he, he just had an off game.
Story_ID: 626856
Speaker 1: Well, in the culture of basketball, what you were saying I--I could relate to what you were saying about being--'cause I've seen kids like that that are big and tall--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but the expectation that, you know, you should dominate if you're tall.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And if you don't, then they call you weak, and they really--if a little guy can't dominate, it's not of consequence, but a big guy--you're a big, sorry something now; you're a big (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I was called that when I was a kid; I'm talking about thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, you know.  I played--I started off with Ducky [ph.] playing biddies, and everybody used to laugh at me like why am I playing biddies, you know.  Biddies was like the young--'cause I was playing within my age group, you know, but I was taller than everyone and--aww!  And I used to hear all kind of mumbling, but that used--that in--that motivated me, okay?  But as the years went by, I started getting better and more confidence in my abilities, and from biddies I played--no, first I played midgets, not biddies.  I played midgets, and from the midgets that year--that next summer, I played on a--with the juniors--with the big boys and--but--yeah, I got all--I got called those kind of names (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's gotta be tough for somebody that's growing that fast too, because you're not--the faster you grow, the less coordinated I think you, you might be--I don't know; I've never been tall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, you're right; you're right.
Speaker 1: But as you're growing I guess you're kind of, you know, trying to adjust to a new body all the time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had a stay in the hospital.  That is correct; I was growing fast for my age, and I remember my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green], you know, she admitted me in the hospital 'cause I was so concerned about my knees, and the doctor said there was nothing wrong with my knees, I was just growing fast.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard that too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And was having tendinitis in my knees, and so I remember I stayed like two days in the hospital for examinations--remember the hospital, Lutheran Hospital [Lutheran Hospital of Brooklyn] in Brooklyn [New York] (laughter)--yeah, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a common phenomenon, too; the knees hurting at a certain point of growth, and then the doctor saying you're gone grow out of it, and you actually do, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 626857
Speaker 1: So by the time you got to high school, you were--well, you knew you were gonna be on a team and all that sort of thing, huh?
Speaker 2: Not really.  From junior high, some--junior high school '64 [1964], I wanted to go to a different high school; I was sent to Thomas Edison High School [Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Education High School] in, in Jamaica, Queens [New York], and I spent one year at Thomas Edison High School, and one of my coaches at Jeff- neighborhood coach--first, Sam Hanger who, who I put on my list who--he could tell my story almost better than me--he convinced me to transfer to Thomas Jefferson High School [Brooklyn, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and back then the reputation of Thomas Jefferson High School was how bad it was, how bad people go there--I'll be fighting every day.  And I didn't wanna go, but Sam Hanger and my high school coach--Sam Hanger was the assistant coach, too, but my high school coach Jerry Wichern--they convinced me that, that that's the school I should--plus it was my--I was zoned for that school; I wanted to go to Canarsie High School.  Canarsie High School's in Canarsie, New York--Brooklyn [New York], and suburban.  Had a great coach, Mark Reiner, who--they won a city championship the year before I wanted to go there, but I wasn't zoned to go there; I was zoned to go to Thomas Jefferson High School, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Jefferson--Thomas Jefferson High School--now this is a--this is the school that Fly Williams [James "Fly" Williams] attended?
Speaker 2: Fly Williams went to James Madison High School [Brooklyn, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Madison, okay, so he didn't go there--okay.
Speaker 2: Jim McMillian went to Thomas Jefferson High School.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, all right.  And I have a note here that Danny Kaye went there as well (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That is correct; Danny Kaye went to that high school (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Riddick Bowe later on, doing the boxing.
Speaker 2: That is correct, that is correct.
Speaker 1: So--and--okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, how was--how'd you like Thomas Jefferson?
Speaker 2: I liked it a lot.  It helped build my toughness even more.  I thought I had a wonderful coach in Jerry Wichern and Sam Hanger; my teammates were remarkable.  It was a great experience for me; it, it helped made me who I became.  And again, it just--you know--and the killing of my brother [Joseph Green] going on my senior year, that just--I feel I matured ten years after that, after that incident my senior year.
Story_ID: 626858
Speaker 1: It appears that you had a lotta good mentors in school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that were concerned about how you were gonna do athletically, and how you were gonna conduct yourself as well, beginning with your mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] and, I guess, your family.  But what did they tell you about being, being big?  Because, you know, there's--I often wonder like what--you know--there's a lotta pressure on a big guy playing ball, you know, so what did they tell you about--how, how do you play as a big guy?
Speaker 2: As a player?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How do I play it?
Speaker 1: How do you conduct yourself even as a person, being a big guy?  'Cause you could be a target being the biggest guy around.
Speaker 2: Oh, again, I think I--the blessings of--the wisdom of my mother, the blessings of my high school coach--coaches [at Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York]--Sam Hanger, Jerry Wichern, the upside--the potential of me accomplishing my dream of being an NBA [National Basketball Association] player--was willing to do whatever it took to become an NBA player.  I knew I had to take--do two things for sure--go to school, okay--to where I can go to any college of my choice, and two, to continue to get better, hone my skills on the court, and don't back down; I mean I never backed down from anyone.  It gave me--helped build up my toughness, you know.  I had a, I had a toughness within me, you know, from my upbringing prior to my brother's [Joseph Green] death, and then when my brother died, I--you know, it didn't break me.  And, you know, me going to school three thousand miles away from home to UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada].  Everybody said--everybody said that I would fail there because I'm leaving New York [New York]; three thousand miles, Las Vegas [Nevada]; the bright lights would blind me.  I went there on a mission, and my mission was for me to fulfill my obligations educationally, and also to accomplish my goals of being an NBA player.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I saw an opportunity.  Out of all the schools that were recruiting me and, and I, I give the honor and respect to Tarkanian [Jerry Tarkanian]; he found a way to convince--you know, the talk back then in the neighborhood was, "If you want [HistoryMaker] Sidney Green, you gotta get his mother, you know he, he's--he'll do whatever his mother say," which was accurate.  He found a way to get close to her and he got close to her, and my mother fell in love with him figuratively; she really liked him, you know.  All the college coaches come--used to come to the house with their suit and tie; he just come--he used to come to the home with his shirt wide open, you know--baggy pants, you know.  Not baggy like how they wearing it now, but I'm talking about just--you know, just--and, you know, she really liked him.  And then I said, "Well, you know, when I go on my visit, I wanna see all what it is--what he's telling us and what I'm feeling."
Story_ID: 626859
Speaker 1: What did you know about Nevada, Las Vegas [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] in '78 [1978] when you were a senior [at Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York]?  I think--hadn't they just been in a tournament or something?
Speaker 2: They were in the tournament the year prior; they played North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Was that for the championship?
Speaker 2: They were in the Final Four [NCAA Final Four].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That UNLV back then was a renegade program, Tarkanian was this, that, and the other and, you know, my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] raised us on the merits of you shouldn't judge a person based on what someone else say about them; you should judge 'em based on face value, and that's how I judged him.  All what they were saying about him, I wanted to judge for myself and, you know, it wasn't what they were telling me about him.  And then, when I went out to UNLV for a visit, I saw an opportunity--I saw an opportunity of being at a program, putting it back on the maps, and an opportunity to play for someone who will turn me, turn me loose to play my game in order enough for me to fulfill my dream of going to the NBA [National Basketball Association].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, Jerry Tarkanian is a--he's a colorful sports figure and--in college basketball, and he's one of the legendary coaches now that people talk about.  What was he like?  What was he like?
Speaker 2: As a coach, or as a recruiter (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As a person--altogether and as a coach.
Speaker 2: To this day, God bless him.  I, I think he's a--he's the one that convinced me to go UNLV to further my education and to fulfill my dreams of being an NBA player, you know.  He, he touched my mother's heart, he touched my heart in regards of making sure that I do the right things to fulfill my dreams--what I was there for.  I was part of a program to put it on the map back then, and it enabled players further on, you know, years after I left, you know; especially the next year of guys like Armen Gilliam, God bless him, we lost him last year.  Larry Johnson, Stacey Augmon and Greg Anthony, among the other great players that have followed me.  So, from what I saw in 1979 when I visited the school, an opportunity not only to fulfill my objective of getting an education, I saw an opportunity to build the program up, and if I had a chance to do it over again, I would make the same decision.  I thought Tarkanian was--again, as--from what everyone told me about him before I officially met him was inaccurate.  I judged him based on face value, and I thought he was--I thought he did a heck of a job of convincing me and my family that, that's where I should go.
Story_ID: 626860
Speaker 1: Now, did he have a--was there like a, a close relationship between the, the whi- the scouts of UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] and the street basketball programs in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Back then?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.  The only contact he had in New York was Rodney Parker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Rodney Parker--he found out--and Rodney Parker knew him before--he found out that Rodney Parker knew me and my family, and another good friend of mine, Winston [ph.].  And back then, the rules were different; let me make sure we understand that, far as recruiting.  But he found--he, he did his due diligence of finding out who really was part of my life, you know, and just those two guys.  Even my high school coach [Jerry Wichern] didn't want me to go to UNLV, you know, because of the perception that was labeled on him and the program.
Speaker 1: Well, why do you think they, they--you know, there's a--this bad--this--I, I, I remember--they, they almost try to portray Tarkanian [Jerry Tarkanian] as doing something wrong, but I, I never--it never seemed to be manifested where he was any worse than (unclear), you know.
Speaker 2: Through my experience and from what I saw and, you know, after--you gotta look at the fact that he recruit inner city kids that had unbelievable talent, that probably didn't have the academia to go to any other school, and who probably--other schools wouldn't touch because maybe that, and also certain characteristics that they have that other schools wouldn't touch either.  But, you know, Tark was on--from my, my experience, if you played the game of basketball, and have a upside of becoming better, and uplifting his program, he's gonna target you and probably get you to come to his school.  And by that, you know, people start labeling him, you know--the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] and all that, and that's another story.  But, you know, I saw him give so many student athletes opportunities to better themselves both on the court and, of course, academically as well and, unfortunately, some--the majority of them took advantage of it and others, unfortunately, didn't.  And the others that didn't, you know, those are the ones that people remember.  "Well, So and So--," and--you know--but he, he gave many people an opportunity to further--to better themselves; it's up to you to see it and take advantage of it the right way, and so, you know, you know; like he said, "I'm here to coach you, you know, I wanna be your coach not only on the court, but off the court, but you have to be responsible for yourself also."  And I've personally witnessed many student athletes that, unfortunately, didn't embrace the opportunities that was given before them of, you know, being a student athlete at UNLV.
Story_ID: 626861
Speaker 1: Before we get you outta high school, is there any--anything else significant about high school?  Did you run for class office?  Or did you have a--did you do anything else in high school?
Speaker 2: No.  My ultimate focus was being a student and playing the game of basketball and bettering myself and getting my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] outta the ghetto.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my ultimate objective, really, you know.  One thing I missed my senior in high school was my high school prom and--'cause I had to make a choice of either going to my high school prom or going to the McDonald's All-American Game and, of course, I went to the high--the McDonald's All-American Game in Washington [D.C.], and that Monday--that next week--everybody was just talking about the prom--how great it was, how much fun everyone had and, you know, we won't be able to experience that again.  But I told my classmates, "One of these days, I'm gonna experience it again."  And this past year, 2011, we had our thirty-second high school--that it was--we couldn't do the thirtieth for whatever reason, but we had our thirty-second--it was thirty-two years, and we had our thirty-second high school class reunion in New York [New York], and I was able to go, and I enjoyed myself immensely with all my high school mates.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And everybody was wondering why, why I was dancing on the dance floor, and I got on the mic towards the end and reminded them, "You guys remember thirty-two years ago you brag about how much fun you all had, and what I miss, and I promised myself that I was gonna be on that dance floor all night," and that was the most fun I had in a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--now, was Thomas Jefferson [Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York] an all-black high school, for the most part?  Or--
Speaker 2: Black and Puerto Ricans, correct (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Black and Puerto Rican, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 626862
Speaker 1: When you were in the McDonald's All-Amer- [McDonald's All-American Game] did you go to see the game, or were you in it?
Speaker 2: I was in it, correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's what I thought.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who were some of the other all-stars from around the country (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, boy.
Speaker 1: Now, these are high school students in a pick that's the best in the country, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  [HistoryMaker] Ralph Sampson, Sam Bowie, Clark Kellogg, Isiah Thomas, you know, Tony "Red" Bruin, who was a--he and I was the top two players in New York City [New York, New York] at that time--Tony "Red" Bruin, a good friend of mine.  Our team executive vice president John Paxson, and Raymond McCoy from Chicago [Illinois] here; he was a great point guard.  Personally, I thought he was better than Isiah Thomas--that's my personal opinion; Teddy Grubbs, who I thought was one of the best power forwards I ever played against; he's from Chicago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah, Teddy Grubbs, right.
Speaker 2: He was an incredible player as well.  To this day, they still say, "The 1979 McDonald's All-American team was the best," yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were a lotta greats--Ralph Sampson was 7'4" (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Steve Stipanovich, he was--Byron Scott; I mean we had a great team.
Speaker 1: He's the coach of the Cavaliers [Cleveland Cavaliers] now.
Speaker 2: Correct; that is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, that's--that sound like a great team.  So--so, okay--so, you graduated in, in 1978 [from Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York], and so what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.  So--but this is--what--you know, this is--there's a sadness too, 'cause your brother [Joseph Green] was killed and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct; he was killed in '78 [1978]--November, '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978]; okay, so just before--
Speaker 2: Well, I--it was my senior year, right before--yeah, that was--it was my senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was in the fall then?
Speaker 2: It was the fall--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --correct.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 626863
Speaker 1: So you came out in '79 [1979], and so when you--what, what, what did you do for the summer?
Speaker 2: The year that I got out--outta high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York]?  Ooh, that summer I--just looking forward to being a student athlete at UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], hearing all the critics saying, why did I make the decision of going to UNLV three thousand miles away from home.  And again, my reason for going to UNLV was I saw an opportunity to fulfill my dreams of being--of graduating, and also being an NBA [National Basketball Association] player and building a program.
Speaker 1: Were there other New York [New York] players at UNLV?
Speaker 2: At that time, no I was the only one.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was the only one.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever--I, I think I mentioned the Rucker League before.  Did you ever participate in that league?
Speaker 2: I played in the Rucker, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I played with Tiny Archibald, Nate Archibald [Nate "Tiny" Archibald] used to have his summer league team, and I played with his team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember Earl Manigault?
Speaker 2: I remember Earl Mani- he was way before me, but I remember hearing stories about how great he was, also.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's one of the legends of the--
Speaker 2: They called him The Helicopter [sic. The Goat]--I remember his nickname.  They said he was incredible as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pee Wee--what's his name, Pee Wee (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Swee' Pea, yeah--you talking about Daniels?
Speaker 2: Kirkland--no.
Speaker 1: Oh, Kirk- oh, somebody else?
Speaker 2: Pee Wee Kirk--Pee Wee--Pee Wee Kirkland from Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: They said he was an incredible player, as well.
Speaker 1: Now, what about Swee' Pea?  I, I thought you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lloyd Daniels [Lloyd "Swee' Pea" Daniels]?
Speaker 1: Lloyd Daniels.
Speaker 2: Lloyd Daniels was a, a remarkable player--unbelievable talent.
Speaker 1: And I think he got a chance--he played for the Spurs [San Antonio Spurs] for a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He played with the--and I was with the Spurs when he played for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was a great player.
Story_ID: 626864
Speaker 1: Las Vegas [Nevada] seems like a place that would distract a student.  So, what do you--
Speaker 2: Well, again, I feel--growing up in Brooklyn, New York on what I was there for attending UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada]--what I--what I went to school there for, and from what everyone was saying what would happen to me, I went there with my guards up; I went there with the ultimate focus of accomplishing my dreams, not being distracted, you know.  As--remember how Frank Sinatra used to say, if you make it in New York [New York], you could make it in any, anyplace, and, you know, that--those bright lights didn't blind me one bit 'cause I went there for a purpose and, you know, I used to tell the--you know--the certain hanger ons that I, I didn't live the way that they thought of being a New Yorker, of hanging out and doing this, that, and the other, you know, because if I was able to stay away from all that growing up in Brooklyn, I'm gonna, for sure (laughter), have that same mindset here in Las Vegas and accomplish my dreams.
Speaker 1: So, did people come after you there, as a--I mean you're a basketball player--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they tried, but they didn't--I didn't let 'em.  I let 'em--I didn't let 'em get too close 'cause, again, I went there with the mindset as I mentioned earlier, but also of not doing anything to hurt my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Is--I hear talk--like at the gyms--about the women that target basketball players.  Here's a guy 6'9", he must be a ballplayer, you know, so ball playing means money, you know.  So, women--other guys that will have, you know, a lotta people--you know, it seem like a lotta people that, you know, see you as a ticket or something you know, would be coming at you.
Speaker 2: I was prepared for all that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause I went through all that, and the stories that I heard from my brother [Joseph Green]--it didn't bother me one bit; I was always--and I'm thankful for it--I was always in control of what I, and who I, wanted to associate myself with to this day, so.
Speaker 1: Do you have a certain philosophy about that?  Because, as I said, you're always a target if you're, if you're this tall, and you--you look like you're playing ball, or associated with it, that people are gonna be coming at you, you know.  So, do you have a philosophy of how you deal with, with people, and how you deal with strangers, and how you deal with the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm a--and, and again, I--it's a wisdom and, and a trait I think I have from my mother.  I'm a good judgment of character, you know.  I don't think I know it all, but I think my instincts--I trust my instincts on judging another person and who I wanna be associated with and affiliated with, so I think I'm, I'm good at that.  And it, it, it have carried me to this point right now in my life of being where I'm at, of being an ambassador for the Chicago Bulls.  And I share, I, I share that with my kids [LaShawn Green and Taurean Green].  My kids see me living that way also, and I hope that they pick up that trait and take it to the next level as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--well--so--now what was your major in at--?
Speaker 2: Sociology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sociology, the study of human concepts.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so, so you did--did you do--did you find college work challenging, or was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was challenging.
Speaker 1: Were you prepared for it, I think, for--
Speaker 2: Mentally I was prepared for it.  It was very challenging, especially being a student athlete and having to put in the work on the basketball court, you know--yeah, carrying fifteen credits and going to practice and, you know, the demands of being a, a Running Rebel [UNLV Runnin' Rebels], okay?  I mean, you know, Coach [Jerry Tarkanian] just didn't roll the balls out there; it was a lotta teaching, a lotta discipline and, you know, you have to--well, you had to pretty much just be ready and--mentally and physically for it, you know.  Physically used to wear me down, but it was an adjustment; I got adjusted to it real quick; it became a habit of what I needed to do.
Story_ID: 626865
Speaker 1: I think I was asking you off camera, but I'll ask it again now.  The name Runnin' Rebels [UNLV Runnin' Rebels] seemed to, you know, indicate some southern confederate, you know.  Is, is the rebels thing in Las Vegas [Nevada], is that what that rebel represents (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The rebel--yeah, the rebel is the school nickname, but runnin' became part of that name itself, the Runnin' Rebels, was when Jerry Tarkanian took over the program back in the early '70s [1970s], and how runnin' became part of it is because how he played his team; his team always ran--go up and down the basketball court, and his objective was to wear out your opponent.  His objective was to not only be in shape physically, but also mentally as well, and the preparation part of it and just how he played, you know.  His team averaged--at one time, his team averaged something like 110 points a game--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, in col- that record will never be broken, you know.
Speaker 1: College teams don't, don't score like that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  And this was before the three point line when they, when they were averaging that.  I mean they used to run, run, run until, you know, the opponents would just fall down figuratively.  So that's where the Runnin' Rebels came from, you know.  And back then, especially in the '70s [1970s], '80s [1980s], everybody wanted to play that style of basketball, and he had the formula of what it took, and his formula, which a lotta people don't know, was his practice--preparation; his incredible practice--incredible.
Speaker 1: And to get in that kind of shape--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --to run like that you had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Play forty minutes of basketball, pressure defense.  It's just not running; I mean it's--it was a system for--you know--the preparation was just incredible.
Speaker 1: So, you had to be in shape--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --play pressure defense, pop the ball loose and hit that--the guy on the outlet pass (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On the wing, yes; get it off the glass and let's go.  Everybody had their designated wing--designated lanes to run and, and let's go.  And again, you know, as I mentioned earlier, it was the type a players that he wanted to play that style--that he recruited, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you're in--though you're, you're 6'9", you could run.
Speaker 2: I could run a little bit (laughter).  I could run a little bit, but I still say his best teams--I mean with all due respect to his championship teams with Larry Johnson and Stacey [Stacey Augmon], I say his best teams, I would have to say, was back in '77 [1977] with--you know, when they lost to--this was before I got there, when they lost to North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  I think that was his best team; that was the team that averaged, I think, 110 points.
Speaker 1: Is that the team with Reggie Theus?
Speaker 2: Reggie Theus, correct.
Speaker 1: Ricky Sobers?
Speaker 2: Ricky wasn't on that team.
Speaker 1: He wasn't on that?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Reggie Theus, Glen Gondrezick, Jackie Robinson, Robert Smith who's, I think, UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] all-time favorite point guards, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Gondrezick had a (unclear) long shot--
Speaker 2: Sam Smith, Robert Smith--yeah.  Sam Smith, they said, used to shoot it right, right outta the parking lot--from the parking lot soon as he walk in the arena--the convention center [Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, Nevada].  But I remember those days when I got there--when, you know, Sammy Davis, Jr., Lola Falana, and all them other great stars would come and watch us play, you know; that was just--those, those were some remarkable--Frank Sinatra I mean, Wayne Newton; they used to come and sit in the stands and watch us play.
Speaker 1: So this is the glamor side of college basketball.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was awesome, it was awesome.  We had our own little Gucci row, you know.  It was, it was great.  Just being able to run up the court, and seeing Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis, Jr. sitting in the stands watching you play, you know, you know.  That was inspiring--that was motivating to me, that was really motivating.
Story_ID: 626866
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you all had long practices, I take it--and a lot of energy.
Speaker 2: Two and a half--three hours, yeah.  Yeah, two and a half, three hours back then.
Speaker 1: So, proportionately, was it--did he [Green's college coach, Jerry Tarkanian] expect you to--like was, was practice about strategy and he expect you to, to, to get in shape otherwise?  I mean--or, or was it in the practice sessions, too, or just, or what?
Speaker 2: It was all about being in shape to comprehend what he expects out of us in regards to--as--in a team format.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But conditioning was a major factor of us to--for us to play that style that he wanted us to.  And the toughness--just, you know, being smart and out thinking our opponents as well.
Speaker 1: So, how was it different, I guess, from another program, I guess, in terms of--did he spend like--about--a lot of time conditioning you all in the beginning--before you would talk about strategy or--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  We had a, a conditioning class weeks before we were able to play--bring out the basketballs and, and, and, you know, be taught by him, but his conditioning class, I think, was--it was, you know, we used to call it, figuratively, suicide 'cause it was, it was brutal.  But it, it--again, it, it, it prepared us for what, for what to come during the season.  It prepared us without--it made us even more tougher.  And again, going back to the type of players that he recruited [to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], you know, tough kids from the inner cities, you know, he would always say, "If you could withstand living where you--and I saw where you live, how you live, and who lived around you, this ain't nothing, you know; it's a mindset."  And he had us all convinced that, you know, "Yeah, okay, right."
Speaker 1: Mentally--now I heard it said by Chica- coaches in Chicago [Illinois], one of the toughest things to do with a kid from the inner city, sometimes, is to change his diet--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --'cause so many kids eat McDonald's and potato chips, and stuff like that, and that stuff is not--a lot of pop--it's not really good nutrition, and you run outta gas, you know?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on this kind of stuff.  Did he try to change your diet at all?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), you know, our trainer's table back then--we had a trainer's table at the Aladdin Hotel [Aladdin Resort and Casino; Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada]--the buffet, the buffet, so--you know, he--you know--no, no; it was up to you to eat what you--just be ready for practice, for conditioning.  No, that wasn't really stressed upon us much.
Speaker 1: In those days, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he left that all up to us, you know, yeah, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know one of the things they publicized, Michael Jordan's preparation, you know; they, they publicized it I guess, I guess in the late '80s [1980s] where he had a trainer that came here and they gave him a--he, he ate a certain amount of food every day--the same kind of food, and it's all nutritionally balanced and stuff like that, that would keep him, you know, at his peak, and--
Speaker 2: That is correct.  Professional basketball is totally different than college, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Professional--in college, you know, you, you really ate what's there, and col- and professional you have, you know, you have--making a little bit a money to pretty much--to where you can afford to have your own dietician or, you know, someone to educate you on what to eat--the proper meals to eat before games.  So it was totally different.  You know, in college, we had our trainer's table at the Aladdin Hotel, and we thought it was great, you know.  We used to--after a hard practice we would just go there and eat, eat, and eat, you know.  The rules were totally different back then so it was--everything was up front and legitimate, and it was great.
Story_ID: 626867
Speaker 1: So what is a typical day like at UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] for you as a student?  What time do you get up, and what would you do, and--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm always an early riser, I always made it to class, I put in my class and I'm a do my work in the mornings and (laughter) while in class, thinking about practice--all the running that we had to do, but stay focus and finish up my class.  In the afternoon, go and have our lunch, then go to prac- a light lunch, but go to practice, put in our two and a half, three hours, and then go to our trainer's table.  Everything was so repetitious.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did you all do the first year when you were there?
Speaker 2: My first year we did good; we made it to the NITs [National Invitation Tournament].  We lost to Virginia--University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia], [HistoryMaker] Ralph Sampson team.  And (laughter) it was so ironic, too 'cause that year when we made it to the NITs, as I mentioned earlier, my last two choices--that was my freshman year; my last two choice was UNLV--no, University of Louisville [Louisville, Kentucky] and UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], and my freshman year they made the tournament; they made--they--you know, they--for the championship, and we made the NITs so I'm sitting watching them play like, "Wow!  I should of been out there in one a those teams."
Speaker 1: Well, how is your game now?  I haven't asked you, like what are your strengths?  What were your strengths in those days and--when, when you were a player--as a basketball player?  What, what do you think you were strong in, and what do you think you were lacking?  Or what were you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think I was--rebounding was my forte.  In high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York] I was a scorer; in college--I wanted to score just as much in college as I did in high school, but I knew it was totally different because I'm playing with great players.  I played with great players in high school but it was different, and I--took me a while to fully understand that actually, really, after my freshman year.  But I was more known as a rebounder.  My toughness, my, my respect that I had for my teammates.  I enjoyed playing with the, the players that I played with, and really I, I used to love to score, but if you would like to name just one, my rebounding was my biggest asset, I'd say, in my game.  I used to love to rebound; I--that was my forte.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I kind of remember that from the Bulls [Chicago Bulls], as you were like the kind of the guy who'd go out and get the rebounds, you know.  Now, now, scoring did you--did they run plays for you at UNLV?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --especially my senior year 'cause we had a fine point guard my senior year--was Tarkanian's [Jerry Tarkanian] son, Danny Tarkanian; thought he was a great point guard, he was a winner--tough.  He knew what to do in order for us to win, and that was to get me the ball (laughter).  Many times he always used to--you know, 'cause we had our wing players, and they wanted the ball, which was fine with me, but when it was time to get to the, you know, nitty gritty, he knew what to do, far as putting the ball in my hands, and he had a great way of getting that done for his dad, for our team.
Story_ID: 626868
Speaker 1: You're on a team with a lot of real flashy players; I mean you made your reputation playing in the paint, and getting the rebounds and then being on high--shooting a high percentage, I guess, in the paint, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the type of offense that we ran [at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], it was a four man passing game with me in the post and, you know, it was a--it was just best--it was great for our team, and we was able to win twenty-four games in a row my senior year--number one in the nation, first time ever in the school's history.  And we lost to North Carolina State [North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina] that year, and that was the year North Carolina State Jim Valvano won the championship, but we lost to them by one point, and that one point was a tipped by Thurl Bailey over one of our players.
Speaker 1: Is that the one where Dereck Whittenburg hit this long shot or something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but it wasn't against us; that was against Houston [University of Houston, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Against Houston, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: It was pretty similar how they beat us; it was the same, you know; Thurl Bailey got a tip--last second tip which, you know.  One of our guys--I'm not gonna mention his name--didn't box out (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, what--what happens in the locker room?  I mean when you watch this,  these on TV--you watch it on TV like I am; I've never been in a game, but I watch on TV and I say, "I wonder what they're gone say to this guy when he gets in the locker room?"  (Laughter) And you can tell who's messed up sometimes.
Speaker 2: I can recall this very vividly.  We didn't say anything to him in the locker room.  After all the tears and everything, you know, evaporated after a few days, you know, we looked at the tape and, you know, we blamed them (unclear) (laughter).  You know, we kind of like laugh about, it like (unclear), "He could of just boxed 'em out;" he could of--yeah, but at, at the end a that game, we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You just knew it was too tough--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no finger pointing, no; we didn't do any of that, no--none of that, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I know just in disorganized sports, playing around in the rec centers and stuff like that, there's a lot of recriminations hurled sometimes at people for losing a game, and I just wonder if it's the same way in an organized set.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is but, you know, and I, in that situation we didn't finger point on it at that moment.
Story_ID: 626869
Speaker 1: Your senior year [at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] now, you're, you're --well, these are the days when most college ballplayers played all four years, right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Which is, unlike today, in 2012, where a player plays freshman year, and then he's drafted by the pros if he's that--if he's good enough (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They call it one and--one and done. In this day and age, yeah.  It's different.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're right; there's a nickname for it now, one and done.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, your senior--when did you first make a all-star team?
Speaker 2: I didn't--in the NBA [National Basketball Association] I never made the all-star team.
Speaker 1: I mean in the--in college, the All-American team, I guess, or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All-Americans, after my freshman year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Freshman year, yeah, freshman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they had you as a--what were you?  Like a--
Speaker 2: I was a--I think thirteen?  Freshman All-American--for second team, Freshman All-American.  And throughout my career, I was on the All-American list--third, yeah, third--thirteen.
Speaker 1: So, what--when--by the time you were a senior, what were your stats as a senior?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I think it was 22, 20, 22, 21 and 10--something like that.
Speaker 1: So twenty-one points, ten rebounds?
Speaker 2: Correct, twenty-one, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Lot of block shots?
Speaker 2: Block shots; I wasn't really known as a shot blocker, you know, but a lotta rebounds (laughter), lotta rebounds.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, that's a--you know, in college ball, that's really--you know, you do--you know, score twenty points is--get ten rebounds, you know, you know, you're doing really well.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--but on--how, how many points did your team average the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That year?  I think we averaged seventy-nine, eighty points--about eighty-two poi- eighty-two games-eighty-two points a game, to my knowledge, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's, that's high--that's still high in college ball, but--so the days of scoring 100 points a game and that sort of thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't think we'll ever see those days again, from that '77 [1977] team--'76 [1976] (unclear) that was incredible--remarkable feat, remarkable.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I don't think we ever see that again--college basketball.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you--the year that you came out, the top players included [HistoryMaker] Ralph Sampson from Virginia [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia]; he had like a--I know Charles Barkley used to play in those days, too, right?
Speaker 2: He was after--no, he was--he, he might--no, he wasn't.
Speaker 1: He wasn't?
Speaker 2: Not the year that I got drafted, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He didn't come out the same year you did.
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had--who, who else?
Speaker 2: I can go--the top five pick my, my year was Ralph Sampson, Steve Stipanovich, Rodney McCray, Byron Scott, [HistoryMaker] Sidney Green was the fifth, Clyde Drexler was that--part of that class also.  Darrell Walker, Russell Cross was the sixth pick for the--yeah; we had some great players.
Story_ID: 626870
Speaker 1: So, what happens in college [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] when you're--you were picked number five--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --that's in the top five; that's the top draft pick of the Chicago Bulls.  Did you have any idea what team was gonna draft you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I'm glad you asked that; no, I had no idea Chicago Bulls was going to draft me.  There were about four or five teams that came and talked with me and to my advisor, and Chicago Bulls wasn't one of them.  I had no idea, when I was chosen fifth, that--I was startled.  I knew I was gonna go past eight or nine, 'cause those were the teams that came and talked with me, and when they picked me, I was startled.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you know what?  Things happen for a reason, and I know I, I didn't play to my abilities or what was expected of me my first two years.  My third year, I had a pretty good year; we had change of coaches and--you know, but I am so glad I was drafted by the Chicago Bulls because I have formed a relationship with our current owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, who is a true friend who I was able to maintain this relationship with him over the last thirty plus years--(unclear) since they, since they traded me.  Doug Collins and Jerry Krause traded me that year Doug Collins came in, and I was able to maintain a friendship, relationship with him and his family--Jerry Reinsdorf and family to this day, and that's why I'm here now representing the Bulls.  Two years ago, he asked me to come and help him win some more championships with me working as a coach back then with Vinny Del Negro, and now I'm in a front office learning business the through his son Michael Reinsdorf (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 626871
Speaker 1: Let me go back to the UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada].  I forgot to really ask you about the NCAA tournament that year, you know.  I got you drafted without asking about that.  But what did you all do that year that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That year?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, my, my rookie year was a bad year for me personally 'cause I had back, back spasms from lifting weights that summer, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'm, I'm talking about NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] and UNLV --
Speaker 2: Oh, my senior year?
Speaker 1: Yeah, your senior year.  What happened that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, we lost to North Carolina State [North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  North Carolina (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, North Carolina State beat us on a last second shot my senior year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that was it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, over the summer you're lifting weights and--
Speaker 2: Lifting weights.  You know, I had my perception of NBA [National Basketball Association]--everybody saying I had to get stronger.  I was what, 205 pounds then and, you know, I needed to get to--and that's all I did that summer was lift weights, lift weights, lift weights; did a little bit a playing and it hampered me throughout my whole, whole, whole season my first year.  I had back spasms that was, you know, due from lifting weights.
Speaker 1: You often hear of back spasms in basketball players when, you know, certain--is it because of the weightlifting (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think I was lifting weights, and again, my perception of that was just for me to get stronger.  Unsupervised--I was doing it all myself--by myself; it was unsupervised.  I thought if I just lift up three hundred pounds and, you know, continue to do that, and get bigger and show my muscles, I'll be fine, but unfortunate thing I didn't play basketball; I didn't play.  I played but I didn't play that summer going into my first year with the Chicago Bulls, and I think that hurt me my rookie year.
Speaker 1: Now, being more muscular, does that change your game?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  The bottom line, what I should have done--you know, hindsight is 20/20; I should have, you know, had a, a strength and conditioning coach monitor me and, and--to make sure that I don't do too much to what it had done to me far as developing my spasms.  And, and play--I should've played more than lift, but I lift more than play that summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And my second year, it was, it was the same pretty much, but then my third year we had a, a--the team was sold and Jerry Reinsdorf hired a, a--(Unclear) Mill [ph.] strength and conditioning coach and I worked with him, and he had me in the best shape of my life.
Speaker 1: Now, was a--Kevin Loughery was the coach when you, when you started (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kevin Loughery was my coach the first two years--
Speaker 1: First two years, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and my third year coach was Stan Albeck.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what was the Kevin Loughery Bulls like?
Speaker 2: We, we--he was a--it was an experience for me; it was an experience for me.  We had some very good players on our team, but it was an experience for me.
Speaker 1: This is nineteen eighty what?  Eighty-three [1983]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983], '84 [1984] season; '85 [1985]--'84 [1984], '85 [1985] season, correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, '83 [1983]; this is pre-Michael Jordan--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --just before Michael Jordan.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got drafted the year before Michael--
Speaker 1: Yeah I seem to--
Speaker 2: --and my second year was the year Michael Jordan got drafted.
Story_ID: 626872
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'm right about this, but I seem to remember Kevin Loughery getting a lot of technical fouls walking on the court and that sort of thing--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but I, I--you know, let's just say I--from watching--maybe the games I saw (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a tough coach; tough for--touch coach also for a rookie at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He'd been a guard with the Baltimore Bullets (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: --and he--okay.  So, so, what was the record of the team when you were playing?
Speaker 2: I know we was below .500; I don't remember the exact--you know, those was--I know my first year it was below .500 because that enabled us to be in the lottery pick--in the lottery that following year to pick Michael Jordan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you, you were playing a power forward and, and center, I guess?
Speaker 2: I was playing the four spot--myself (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Four?  Okay.
Speaker 2: That year on that team was David Greenwood and Orlando Woolridge.  Orlando Woolridge was more of a free scoring forward; David Greenwood was the power forward, so it was me and David splitting time at that position.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I remember Green [HistoryMaker Sidney Green] and Greenwood, right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, people always remember that.  David Greenwood had a similar game, if I remember right. He was a guy that got a lotta rebounds--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Played defense, played smart basketball down low.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And Orlando Woolridge was known for--he wanted--he came outta Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: --he was a shooter--he liked to shoot and, and he was criticized later on for doing too much of that (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now I'm, I'm saying this, not you, so you (unclear); I know you're not, you're not saying, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm a just say he, he didn't see a shot that he didn't like (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 626873
Speaker 1: Well, your third year--is it--was it your third year that, that Michael Jordan came on--or your second year?
Speaker 2: Second.
Speaker 1: Second year, okay.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Now what was that like?  Now here comes--you all, I think, drafted Sam Bowie, and then traded the draft pick to Portland [Portland Trail Blazers], or something, for Michael Jordan?
Speaker 2: Well, it was between Sam Bowie and Michael Jordan.  I don't know who was the first player taken; I think--was it Hakeem [Hakeem Olajuwon]?  No, it wasn't Hakeem.  But anyway, we was able to land Michael Jordan on the third pick, I believe.  And, you know, it was the year that Michael won a national championship [sic.] at North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina], and from there he went to the Olympics [1984 Summer Olympics, Los Angeles, California] and won the gold for us, and then from there he had to come straight to camp [for the Chicago Bulls], so everyone thought that he wouldn't be able to function because of, you know, he didn't get a chance to rest his legs or anything, but he proved everyone wrong.  He didn't prove me wrong 'cause I knew what he can do; I thought he was remarkable in college and, you know, we had certain veterans on that team back then that, you know, thought that his legs would just give out by midseason, but he just elevated his game even more.  And before the All-Star game I, I can recall that someone--a reporter asked me what do I thought about him, you know.  "What do you think about Michael Jordan?"  And I said, "He's the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth so help me God."  And God was my witness of what he had became--incredible.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you kind of feel he was gonna be that way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --before they--
Speaker 2: I thought he was, was a special talent--just remarkable.  And if you could recall, I mentioned earlier, Fly Williams [James "Fly" Williams], you know--that's what I'm saying, he had--Fly Williams had the opportunity that--well, Fly Williams would have taken advantage, the right way, of the opportunity that was given to him like Michael have, he would have been a special player for the NBA [National Basketball Association] as well.  That's my personal opinion.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard that said about quite a few guys, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The best ones--the best ballplayers are the ones that's--unfortunately, didn't make it for whatever reason.
Speaker 1: So, so--Michael Jordan--now, what was he like coming in?  I mean he--I know he didn't--his legs didn't tire out.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: I think he hurt his--he hurt something his--that spring.
Speaker 2: That was his--that was his second year I thought (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear). Was that his second year?
Speaker 2: That was his second year.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He had a little stress fracture.  But the second year was the year that he scored sixty-three points against the Celtics [Boston Celtics]; that was his second year, and he didn't play that much that year and, you know, he came back and scored sixty-three points, and I'm glad I witnessed that.  I was on that team and I saw it, and it was an incredible, incredible individual performance.
Story_ID: 626874
Speaker 1: 'Cause you know the, the sports writers always criticized the Bulls [Chicago Bulls] for drafting too many power forwards--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and they pointed to David Greenwood, you, Woolridge [Orlando Woolridge], and you know they said every time they had chance--so this is the one time--I think in, I think, three or four tries, the Bulls hadn't drafted a power forward--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and drafted Michael Jordan.  So, so--well--but the team still sort of struggled, right?  It didn't, it didn't--you didn't win a lot of games, right?
Speaker 2: With Michael?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.  Well, again, the first year, you know, that's when everyone got a little whiff of Michael--what he was to become.  Second year was the year that he got injured, and he came back and scored the sixty-three points, and after his second year was the year that I got traded to Detroit Pistons, so I wasn't with the Bulls' organization anymore, but they trade coaches then also, and that's when they brought in Doug Collins, and Doug elevated the organization a little bit higher with Michael, and from--after Doug was Phil Jackson, and that's when--Michael didn't win his first championship for us--what, seven years; it took him seven years to win his first championship for the organization.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that, that a lot of people don't realize that it took him seven years, as great as he was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it's saying something about the game of basketball--that you can be the greatest player out there, but you need coaching, you need (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, not only coaching; you need to surround yours--you know, with the right players to complement his God given abilities; yeah, yeah, and that's what they were able to do, you know, even by trading me which, back then, my first ever trade; I was startled but, you know, I understood the dynamics of professional sports after that, you know.  That's fine, you know?
Speaker 1: Now, how did you feel about your playing time when you played with the Bulls?  'Cause you're splitting time with David Greenwood and Woolridge.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was very happy with my third year (laughter); my first two years was--again, it was tough being a rookie, then my second year--but, but my third year was--I enjoyed it because I was getting more educated about what it took to be an NBA [National Basketball Association] player far as, you know, staying in shape all season, which what I did with tutelage of (Unclear) Mill [ph.], our new strength and conditioning coach.  And then, then I got traded to the Detroit Pistons, but I, I enjoyed my years here with the Bulls; I won't trade it for anything else.
Story_ID: 626875
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you were kind of startled huh, being traded to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, 'cause I never experienced anything like that before, especially after having the year that I had prior.  But, again, that was with a new coach--with Doug Collins, and Mr. Reinsdorf [Jerry Reinsdorf] gave him full reins of having whatever player that he wanted on his team, and him and Jerry Krause decided that, you know, to better the organization not only for that year, but for the future as well, what was--what they traded for me for was, was fine; I--you know, for Earl Cureton and a, and another--and a, and a draft pick that following year; that was the start of them building that championship that they envisioned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Earl Cureton would've been a older version of you in some ways (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a few years older--seven years older than me, correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So they figure he played a similar game, lots of rebounds--
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.
Speaker 1: Get down low, smart guy.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then they get a draft pick, too.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So--now, what did you think?  Now, now they came in your third--the interim between your second year or third year, right?  And then you were traded.  Is that what you're saying?  'Cause you never really played for Doug Collins or--
Speaker 2: I never played for Doug Collins, no; no, I never did, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was after my third year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was after my third year--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --'cause I had a four year con- yeah, it was after my third year.
Speaker 1: After your third year with the Bulls [Chicago Bulls]?
Speaker 2: It was after my third year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then, your third year you said you got more playing time.
Speaker 2: I had more playing time and I, you know, understood what it took to, to be an NBA [National Basketball Association] player then and, you know, with the help, of course, with (Unclear) Mill [ph.], you know; he got my body and mind right for the NBA grueling season (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  It is a long season, and--so the strength--having more strength, more muscle power is one thing.  But what else do you have to learn to be a successful NBA player?
Speaker 2: Getting your rest (laughter), staying away from--back then staying away from the bad crowd, but rest was very important, and eating the right type of foods, you know, to where you can perform night in and night out, yeah.  It's a discipline; it was a discipline.  I mean I was disciplined coming outta college [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], but I just didn't know what it--you know, how to--you know, eighty-two games plus preseason games which was a total of about ninety games, plus playoffs if you happen to make 'em.  It was, you know, it was a process and a--that I didn't fully understood at that time.
Story_ID: 626876
Speaker 1: At the Pistons [Detroit Pistons] now; you're, you're with the Piston team of the '80s [1980s]; they called 'em the Bad Boys and all that sort of thing.  So, was, was there actually a bad boy training for these guys (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was there, that was the year that they started calling them the Bad Boys--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my first year with the Pistons 'cause that was Dennis Rodman's first year and John Salley--the first year they were rookies, and they traded for Adrian Dantley; that was Adrian Dantley's first year, so it was the four of us that was there alongside of the players that was there prior; of course Isiah, Bill Laimbeer, Vinnie Johnson, Joe Dumars.
Speaker 1: Was Mahorn there?
Speaker 2: Mahorn was there as well, correct.  So, you know, we--they felt that the four pieces that was there, that they inherited--not inherited, that they traded for would bring 'em to that next--which we did; we had a great year.  That was the year that the (unclear)--we played the Boston Celtics and that pass that was thrown to Larry Bird in the playoffs, if you remember that, when Larry Bird stole a pass and made the layup?  Yeah.  We had a great year that year; I thought Chuck Daly did a remarkable job with their team.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, that was--a remarkable team when Isiah Thomas from a point guard.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: I mean--so, so--this is a team that won--you know, was more successful than the Bulls [Chicago Bulls], you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean one loss and all that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They had a--they had a growing reputation around the league, and Isiah Thomas being one of the big stars of basketball then.  But, do you, do you, do you think that the team actually was a--had a bad guy mentality--I mean, as such?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Well, you had players like, of course, you know, Rick Mahorn was a bruiser and Bill Laimbeer knew how to get under everybody's skin.  Bill Laimbeer was the type of player and teammate that if you played with him, you'll love him, and if you played against him, you know, you'll wanna, figuratively, you know, chew his head off--take his head off.  So--now I didn't--after I left--the years after I left, you know, that's when they became more of the bad boys, you know--that image.  But my first year I didn't--you know, we just played hard basketball and did whatever it took to win.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think Chuck Daly did a remarkable job with that team.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you--the first year you all went to the Eastern Conference Finals that's against Boston--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and barely lost.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 626877
Speaker 1: What happened the second year?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a free agent, and the New York Knicks extended an offer to me and my family that was hard for me to refuse, and that was a dream come true for me to play for the Knicks.  It was--thought my agent did a remarkable job of helping me fulfill my ultimate dream of being a New York Knick.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--here you, you know, you get a chance to go home as a New York Knick.  Now, did you get a chance to buy your mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] the house and everything?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that now.  We--I didn't ask you about that.  Now, I know that's probably one of the first things you tried to do, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, at first she didn't wanna leave Brooklyn [New York], and I convinced her finally; me and my sister Deborah [Deborah Green Patterson] convinced her, after she got her purse snatched in Brooklyn--in our old neighborhood and, you know, not one time but two times, and that was it.  I had to give her a love threat.  To this day I still say it was a love threat.  I told my si- my sister called and told me, and I said, "Put Mama on the phone."  And I said, "Mama, if you ever want me to talk to you again, you get this house right now.  If not, I'm not gonna talk to you again."  And I never talked to her--I never spoke to her like that before (laughter).  And I said, "I'll talk to you later.  Please give me--give the phone back to Deborah."  And I told Deborah what I said (laughter), you know.  "Deborah, this is what I told her; you know she's not gonna handle this right, so--," and I told her, and I'm not gonna talk to her again if she don't take this house that my sister found for her right around the corner from her in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  And got off the phone, and about a hour after that, my sister called, told me that she--she's gonna take the home that, that I bought for her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was, you know, that was a blessing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she moved to Pittsburgh then.
Speaker 2: She moved to Pittsburgh--Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, out of New York.  So whereas I, you know, told her she had her own private doctor, she had her own garden, you know she--you know, I used to love to go there and watch her in her garden, planting her collard greens and okra, and tomatoes and didn't have to worry about anyone sneaking up behind her.
Speaker 1: She probably hadn't had a garden since South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Never, no.  Not in Brooklyn (laughter).  Not in Brooklyn or Harlem [New York, New York], so it was a joy seeing her.
Speaker 1: Any, any community where they write, 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' [Betty Smith] and it's a sensation because a tree grew (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  Matter of fact that was a little nickname they gave me in one of--an article in New York when I was in high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York], "Tree Grows in Brooklyn."  But no, she never had her own garden at all 'til she moved to Pittsburgh, Penn Hills.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so that had been done already by the time you go back to New York.  So--but you have like brothers and sisters still in New York area, I would imagine, right?
Speaker 2: At this moment?
Speaker 1: No, when, when you were traded.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, of course.  I mean there was, you know, many family members didn't want that for her to leave them, but it was for her; it was better for her--for her health and protection.
Story_ID: 626878
Speaker 1: Okay, so what were the New York Knicks like in 1980--this is 1987 now?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the--yeah; it was the year that Rick Pitino took over the coaching reins there, and it was his first year coming out of college, Providence [Providence College, Providence, Rhode Island], and he wanted to instill the up tempo game, full court pressure, and diamond in one full court press, and the reporters and everybody at that time said that it wouldn't work because you got eighty-two games and you got NBA [National Basketball Association] players, and how he's gonna motivate the players to play that style throughout the whole season--eighty-two plus games, and he was able to do it.  We won my first year--correct me if I'm wrong, I think we won ten, twelve games more than the, you know, prior year than we would--won our division conference.  We had the best record in our division, and the next year we won, I think, fifteen more games or something like that.
Speaker 1: You were in the same division with Boston [Boston Celtics], right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: In New York.  So, that's, that's--you know.  Now, Bird [Larry Bird] was still playing then, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So that's, that's a remarkable accomplishment.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who, who was on the team?
Speaker 2: My first year was Mark Jackson's rookie year; there was--
Speaker 1: Ewing [Patrick Ewing] playing then?
Speaker 2: Trent Tucker, of course Patrick (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Trent Tucker, okay.
Speaker 2: Louis Orr, Pat Cummings, Darrell--no Wal- no it wasn't Darrell Walker.  Rod Strickland.  We had a pretty good team.  Yeah, we were--but he had us playing; he, he had us believing ourselves, that we can do it; forget about all what everybody else say that we can't, and we did it.  We won more games than the last year--that previous year.
Speaker 1: Was that--Dominique Wilkins' brother was playing, too, wasn't he (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Gerald Wilkins.
Speaker 1: Gerald Wilkins, yeah.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right--yeah.  Yeah, I remember that team.  So--yeah, that was a strong New York Knicks team.  So, so--you won your division but how did you all do in the playoffs and--
Speaker 2: Of course we lost to Boston (laughter).  Was it Boston or Chicago [Chicago Bulls]?  (Unclear) I can remember.  That next year, I believe--I remember we beat Philadelphia [Philadelphia 76ers]; we swept them four zip in the first round of the playoffs--following my second year.  And I remember we won twenty--during the season we won like twenty-four, twenty-five home games in a row, and we lost that twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth game, and we got booed off the court by our fans in New York [New York] (laughter).  That broke our heart like, wow!  But that's New York fans--the smartest fans in the world.
Speaker 1: Do the fans really--how do the fans affect you when you're playing?  I mean the--
Speaker 2: It don't affect me.  If you're playing away from, from your home court and you get booed, personally, it just inspired and motivated me, you know.  The--up to an amount just a--you know.
Speaker 1: But at home, you know--
Speaker 2: Get booed?  It's (laughter), it's an experience.
Speaker 1: How--are, are the Philadelphia fans the worse fans in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I keep hearing that Philadelphia fans are the worst in sports, but--I mean in terms of booing other players and doing things, but--I mean is that, is that really true?
Speaker 2: I didn't never really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You never--well, it's probably not then--not--
Speaker 2: Not when I played, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the, the sports writers always write about 'em as being, you know--
Speaker 2: No, never experienced it.
Story_ID: 626879
Speaker 1: So, who is your--when you were playing, who was your toughest opponent that you faced, do you think?
Speaker 2: Individually?
Speaker 1: Well, as a team and as individual players, you know.  Who were the toughest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Celtics [Boston Celtics].
Speaker 1: The Celtics?  Really?
Speaker 2: Kevin McHale was one of the toughest players I ever had to defend.  He was so uncanny, he was so imposing; he had unbelievable post moves--up and under--just so, so good; he was just so good no matter, you know, our scout report was to be aggressive with him and deny him from his position on the box that he wanted, he always found a way to get there with his footwork, and long arms and--you know; it was like pick your poison playing against the Celtics 'cause you have--try to stop Kevin McHale from doing--and Parish [Robert Parish] doing their thing, and you have, of course, Bird [Larry Bird] out there, and you have a great point guard in Dennis Johnson, God bless him--his soul.  It was tough, but they were one of my toughest teams that I've ever had to play against.  I mean all--every team in the NBA [National Basketball Association] is tough, but in that year--those years with Bird and (unclear).  And then, of course, the Lakers [Los Angeles Lakers], you know, with Magic [Magic Johnson], and Kareem [Kareem-Abdul Jabbar], and Worthy [James Worthy], and Jamaal Wilkes and, you know.
Speaker 1: Now here's Kareem; you--that, that must have been something to play against him--somebody that you've watched as a kid.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah (laughter).  I remember my first year playing against Kareem was my rookie year; he--you know, I got in the game to defend Kareem and he, he knew I was in awe by him and, you know, first couple a possessions, you know--bang, bang, bang, and one time--next possession he--I went up for a rebound and he tried to go over me; went over my back and hit me on my head with his elbows and that woke me up quick, you know (laughter).  That awe that I had of Kareem just evaporated after that hit, and I said, "Okay, I'm in a war now," (laughter) you know, so I always--when I see him, I always kid him about that experience I had with him on that, on that, on that game.  But he was a remarkable player.
Speaker 1: Now, is he--do you think--I've often thought--now this is just me look--well, watching--I was at a game once with the Bulls [Chicago Bulls] and the, and the Lakers when they had Artis Gilmore, and if Artis Gilmore was 7'1", how tall was Kareem?  Kareem seemed like he was taller--much taller than Artis Gilmore.
Speaker 2: I think they say he was 7'2"; he was about a inch taller than him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't know; seem like he was much taller, but I don't know if that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kareem, his physique was long and, you know--long, and Artis had a, you know, bigger body width wise.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, width wise.
Speaker 1: Maybe just a optical thing--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: But, yeah, he looked a lot longer.  He is made long, so he has longer arms and everything else--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so, yeah.  So he just looked gigantic.  I said, "Now, how in the world," (laughter).  They're not even close to the same--they looked like they were close to the same size, you know, walking around, you know.
Speaker 2: Both great players.
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: Both great players.
Speaker 1: And Gilmore was gone from the--he, he was--he was not playing with the Bulls anymore; he had just left, I guess, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he was with--he was with the Spurs [San Antonio Spurs].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: With the Spurs, yeah, I think it was--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, do you get a chance--when you're, when you're playing an opposing team, do you get a chance to know the players on the other teams in the NBA?  Do y'all ever eat together after the game, or do they--or do, do the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The game is so--you know--well, certain players on certain teams you probably know from, you know, the summer, or going on your NBA trips during the summer, you know, but--yeah.  Yeah, but it's--you know, it's part of the professional sports.  As far as embracing and hugging and figuratively kissing each players before games, you know, I never unders- you know, my objective was to, to beat you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I always wondered--we, we see certain teams play, and the guys come out and they act like they're, they're greatest friends in the world, you know.  I just wonder if they hang out after the game, or what, you know--how, how well the--your team knows the opposition, you know; that's what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I (unclear) now--I didn't wanna warm our hearts up to my opponents too much.  If I knew somebody on the opposing team I just--I say, "Hi," but just leave me alone, 'cause I gotta focus on what I gotta do for my team.
Story_ID: 626880
Speaker 1: You played with some really great players.  What was Patrick Ewing like to play with?
Speaker 2: A beast, figuratively.  He was a hard worker, played the game with his, with his heart, the passion for the game--great player, great teammate.  My two years I played with him was fantastic.  Michael Jordan denied him from ever winning the championship in his Eastern Conference (laughter) which--you know, but--which he would have been able to win a few championships for the Knicks [New York Knicks]--for the organization's sake, but this guy, number twenty-three, from the Chicago Bulls, denied that (laughter).  And that was--Michael used to get a thrill out that, too; "You ain't gone" (laughter), "unh-uh, not while I'm here" (laughter).
Speaker 1: I remember he had similar relationship to Charles Barkley, too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: Barkley was a great player.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They never could win one.
Speaker 2: No.  Michael denied that.
Speaker 1: Clyde Drexler.
Speaker 2: Clyde.
Speaker 1: Well, he did win it one--yeah, I think the year that Michael left (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) With Houston [Houston Rockets].
Speaker 1: Right, with Houston when they--
Speaker 2: That is true; when I came.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in '98 [1998] they, they did win it, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Or was it in the middle of the--wait, was it, was it after he left?  Immediately after he left or in the--no, it was before--right--when he--well, when he left to play baseball.
Speaker 2: Baseball, okay, right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's when he won, yeah.  So they finally did get one.  But--yeah.  So--okay.  So, how--you were at the--you were with, with the Knicks just a couple of years, right?
Speaker 2: I was with the Knicks for two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, those were some good teams, but they just couldn't get over the--either the Celtics [Boston Celtics] or the Bulls I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or the Bulls, correct.
Speaker 1: Well, the Pistons [Detroit Pistons] too were playing good ball, too, so.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 626881
Speaker 1: You went to the Hornets [Charlotte Hornets], right?
Speaker 2: No, from the Knicks [New York Knicks] I went to the Orlando Magic.
Speaker 1: Orlando Magic, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was the first player taken in the expansion draft from the Orlando Magic that year, and I played with them for a year, then from there I went to San Antonio [San Antonio Spurs].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you surprised that you, you were traded to the Magic on, in expansion draft?
Speaker 2: No, not really because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They kind of draft you, right?  There are certain players they make available and they, and they draft 'em--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  You know, the Knicks fans--quite a few Knicks fans was disappointed because--from the year that I had with them far as playing the role that I played, but I had--but two years was good, you know.  My wife [Deidra Jackson Green] really didn't care for New York [New York], being a Las Vegan, and the kids [LaShawn Green and Taurean Green] was small and I was--my agent was informed that I would be their first pick in Orlando, and I said, "It's a great place to raise my kids."  And I was happy that that took place.
Speaker 1: Well, well, when you were in New York, I mean did you--I mean was it, was it really great to be there?  I mean, I mean was it what you thought it was gonna be going back to New York City?
Speaker 2: It was different, it was different, it was different 'cause I lived in Yorktown Heights [Yorktown, New York] and--again, you know, my, my family--my kids--my wife didn't really care for New York that much and being a Las Vegan girl, and also a little bit a pressure from friends that you haven't seen in a while.  It was--it took its toll, but the two years was great though. I was glad that I was able to be the number one pick for the Orlando Magic expansion draft.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you didn't tell me like--we didn't talk about where you met your wife, but did you meet her in Las Vegas [Nevada] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah, we was college sweethearts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My junior year we met [at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], and she was a sophomore, I was a junior and, and she's a girl that I just fell in love with and, you know, after I--I wanted her to do her due diligence on me, and I did my due diligence on her and her upbringing, and we called my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] up and told her.  I said, "I think I found a girl who I'm gonna marry eventually, and have my kids."  And to this day, we're--twenty-seven years of marriage.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you get married before you--
Speaker 2: I got married my rookie year in Chicago [Illinois].  She came to Chicago--I convinced her to come with me to Chicago and she could finish up her education, and when she was here that was the plan, and she was pregnant, and got married in March, up--during my season.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You, you think it's easier on a married NBA [National Basketball Association] player than it is on a single one, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Depends upon an individual, depends upon--everyone have different personality traits and characteristics.  I knew what I wanted.  I wanted to pretty much settle down; I didn't wanna go--I knew I had the right one for me and I didn't--hanging out and all that, I--she was--reminded me a little bit of my mother--her values.  She's solid.
Story_ID: 626882
Speaker 1: In Orlando [Florida].  Now what was this?  Now, you come in on--this is a expansion team, right--in Orlando?  And so you come in.  Who else is, is coming in to Orlando?
Speaker 2: Reggie Theus, Sam Vincent, Jerry Reynolds, Dave Corzine, Nick Anderson--it was his rookie year from Chicago [Illinois] here; Matt Guokas was our coach and, you know, it was a--it was an interesting season.  Why?  Because the first time the City of Orlando ever had a professional team, and everybody was just gung ho about the Magic [Orlando Magic] that first year, and about the players and--I remember my first game, I walked out my house and my whole cul de sac--my whole neighborhood was out there with signs and cheering me on, like, "Good luck," and (laughter) we didn't win that many games that year, but we won a lot of hearts from the people in that city.
Speaker 1: It sound like a good group, you know, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we just--you know, we didn't win that many games; they think we won like eighteen, nineteen games, but it was, it was a wonderful experience, and for me to be able to keep my kids [LaShawn Green and Taurean Green] in one place--of them having stability 'cause that's--you know, we both agreed that if I should ever get traded that, you know, we'll keep 'em there, let me finish my tour.  And we was able to keep the kids there when I got traded to San Antonio [San Antonio Spurs] and moved on to Charlotte [Charlotte Hornets].
Speaker 1: Yeah, all those players sound--I, I remember them at their prime, you know.  I don't know what they were like when they were--by the time they got to Orlando, or what their relative ages were but, but Sam Vincent, and all of those guys were, you know--Reggie Theus (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Again, as I said, we didn't win that many games, but we won the hearts of, of that city 'cause they were--they really embraced us.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know Matt Guokas?  He's a New York guy [sic.] isn't he?
Speaker 2: Matt Guokas?  No, he played--he--I don't think he's from New York [New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't know him prior, but it was fun playing for him also, yeah; Matt Guokas was our coach.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  So, that's--Orlando is the home of Walt Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort] and all that, and you got a new basketball team.  Do you have a new arena and everything?
Speaker 2: It was a new arena, correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is before they got Shaq [Shaquille O'Neal], right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And, and Penny Hardaway and all that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But just bef- it wasn't, wasn't too long before they had him, right?
Speaker 2: It was two years after.
Speaker 1: Two years?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, two years after.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After I got traded.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I was with them for only one season.
Story_ID: 626883
Speaker 1: So, well what happened?  They traded you to San Antonio [San Antonio Spurs].
Speaker 2: San Antonio--they were looking--Larry Brown was the coach; he was looking for a rebounder.  Larry Brown always wanted, wanted to coach me, even in college 'cause my last two choices, as I said, was UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and Louisville [University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky], and he was UCLA head coach--incoming head coach (cough) excuse me, and they wanted me to come and complement David Robinson like how I did with Patrick Ewing in New York [New York], you know, to play a role and, you know, keep all the hungry guys off them and take a little pressure off them, and--
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, that, that is a role for a power forward, like you.  Now you--somebody was asking me like, "Do you know a [HistoryMaker] Sidney Green?"  I said, "Yeah, he was a--played the role of the mule on most of the teams he was on."
Speaker 2: Most of the teams, correct.
Speaker 1: Good strong guy, get the rebounds, you know, and do the dirty work.  A lot of people don't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, when you look at the stats you don't see all of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, certain things that don't show up in the stats I was able to try to help my teammates with and--
Speaker 1: So, what is that role--for the basketball--really basketball fans out there?  Like what do you--how do you complement a Patrick Ewing or a David Robinson (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, again, it depends upon the, the player and, you know, how I thought I complemented Patrick was me guarding maybe the best center on their team to keep him outta foul trouble, you know--fighting under the rip boards to get the rebounds for positions, you know, and hitting the open shot if, if it's there for me.  And like you, like you said earlier, maybe doing a little dirty work--grabbing the shorts of the opponent--slowing 'em down a little bit, you know.  I don't think I ever did any cheap shots but, you know, some, some guys do that; you know--cheap shots with the elbows and--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) back to the Pistons [Detroit Pistons] (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But you were never known for that, far as I know.  I know I never heard people say that about you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: But basketball is tricky, though.  I mean my, my father [James Green] used to, used to point out, "Look, he grabbed that guy's shorts.  He stepped on that guy's foot."  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Maurice Lucas was great at that; may God bless him also.  I remember they--somebody compared me to Maurice Lucas coming outta college [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada]--the toughness, the rebounding abilities and the looks, you know.  "You look just like Maurice."  But I thought he was a great player also.  I admired his skills and what he brought to the game.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right, that's right.  A lot of people don't talk about him now, but he was, he was something.
Speaker 2: Oh, he was awesome.
Speaker 1: Yeah--wow.  So, so, how did San Antonio--now you had David Robinson, The Admiral, the man who went to the [U.S.] Navy first, came back to the NBA [National Basketball Association], 7'1", powerful guy--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --played with him and--who else was on that team?
Speaker 2: Terry Cummings--
Speaker 1: Yeah, from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: From Chicago, uh-huh.  Willie Anderson, Rod Strickland.
Speaker 1: He played in New York [New York] with you.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We had a--I thought we had a good nucleus.  That was the year that I got traded.  I had bone spurs on my ankles and I had surgery on 'em, and I had 'em taken out and I--laterally I couldn't do the things that I was--used to do prior, so I think that hampered me my first--well, both years--well, throughout the rest of my career in the NBA.  But I wasn't as effective as I was hoping to be, like I was for the Knicks [New York Knicks] because of that--and the Magic [Orlando Magic], yeah.  So, it was a--we had a good team; we could've played better, but we had a good--and it was a joy playing with and alongside David Robinson; he was remarkable player also.
Speaker 1: Now, you all made the playoffs, right?  In those days, I believe (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, we did--the Spurs, the playoffs.
Speaker 1: Who, who was the coach of the Spurs then?
Speaker 2: Larry Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay--yeah, right; you said that--Larry Brown, yeah.
Story_ID: 626884
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Larry Brown.  Now, he's a legend as a coach for--he's considered to be this pure coach, and all the sportswriters talk about him.  He's the only guy that won a NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] championship and a NBA [National Basketball Association] championship, you know.  But--and he goes--he seems to go like a gunslinger, from team to team, so what was it like playing for Larry Brown?  Is he a genius?
Speaker 2: I think he is; I think he's one of the top five to seven coaches in the--ever coach in the NBA.  I thought he's--playing for him was great; it was a dream come true.  I know he always liked me, especially in high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, New York]; he was disappointed that I didn't pick UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] when he was coaching there; he really recruited me hard that year.  But just playing for him--he's a great teacher; loves to teach, you know.  I remember someone asked me, "Do you--don't you think he's an over teacher?" He liked to teach.  I never heard of an over teacher; a teacher is a teacher, and he just loves the game of basketball.  He has a deep passion for the game, you know.  Every, every coach, you know, even--every coach have idiosyncrasy, and if his idiosyncrasy, from what other people thought and think, is him over teaching, you know, let him be.  I thought--I enjoyed my two years of playing under him.  He's very passionate, very passionate--wants all his players to, to like him.  Of course they respect him, but he wants to make sure that they like him also and, you know, he's demanding but he's, he's fair, honest, and it was a joy playing for him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any analysis of--or, or any thoughts about why he moves around so much?
Speaker 2: No, I, I don't but, you know, there's a--no, I don't have any analysis on that; I, I can't judge a play--only thing that I can judge him on is just my two years of playing for him, and the year that he recruited me out of high sc- try to recruit me to go to UCLA from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  To this day, I give him my, my, my respect.
Speaker 1: Hey, is, is Popovich [Gregg Popovich] a disciple of Larry Brown?
Speaker 2: Yes, he is.  Popovich was Coach Brown assistant coach when I was at San Antonio [San Antonio Spurs], and--now, you saw--I know I--we, we saw the abilities that he had in managing people; he's great at managing people--players.  He commands the respect and, you know, he--he's real--and it's indicative right now, you know, his record--how many wins he have and the championships that he had won for the Spurs, being at the helm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you were there for two years with the Spurs with Larry Brown coaching both years (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was the coach both years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you--now you were at San An-
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: No, he was coach for--'cause Jerry Tarkanian came in the second year?  Yeah, he was the coach--he coached me for that one year there 'cause Jerry Tarkanian came in that second year (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) third year.  It was a--yeah, yeah, it was--yeah, he coached me for two years 'cause Coach came in the following year.  No, Coach Brown coached me for one year, then Coach Tarkanian came in and Coach Tarkanian coached the team maybe for about twenty games, and then the owner expelled him--fired him and brought in John Lucas [John Lucas II], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what--so do you think--so, a lot of college coaches can make the transitions to the pros, though I know there's a lot of factors there, depending on whether somebody wins or loses in the pros, you know.  But did you have any thoughts about Jerry Tarkanian?  He had had such great success in college but he, he comes into the San Antonio Spurs and--was it just the wrong mix of people at the time, or what?
Speaker 2: It was--I think it was different than what he expected--had to give him time.  You're talking about a coach that coached all his years in college, and then changing his habits of motivating and teaching, you know, his players on what to do and how to perform on a court.  One thing he always told me that the, you know, the preparation part, it takes--it's hard to prepare, prepare a team because you're playing so many games and he, he, he always took pride in preparing his team for three--two, three, four days prior to the games, and everything was so fast for him, yeah.  It was, it was different; I think it was much different than he thought.
Story_ID: 626885
Speaker 1: So, in '92 [1992], you were traded to the Hornets [Charlotte Hornets], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: And now who was on the Hornets in those days and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning, Muggsy Bogues, Dell Curry, Mike Gminski; Allan Bristow was the coach.  The trade as a--from the Spurs [San Antonio Spurs] to the Hornets, they pretty much wanted me to be Alonzo Mourning, you know, a court mentor for--you know, the--'cause that was Alonzo Mourning rookie year, and it was a joy--it was an experience for me.
Speaker 1: I know it was a lot of fanfare about Mourning and Johnson being together on the team.
Speaker 2: Hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: They made a lot of commercials, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Grandmamma, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right (laughter).  He's still known as Grandmamma, that, you know, commercial where he dresses up like his grandmother.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the creative Madison Avenue--
Speaker 2: But that was a great experience, just being on that team with them and watching 'em grow, from the start of the season to the end of the season--it was, it was great.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you've got--you, you were saying you have--you had ankle problems and bone spurs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had bone spurs in my ankles.  I--that happened my years in Orlando [Orlando Magic].  I had surgery before the trade and it pretty much hampered me for a good duration of my career.  The bone spurs was taken out but, you know, it hampered my lateral movements and my jumping abilities, and it was different.
Speaker 1: So, is this something that could have been handled differently today if, if, if you had the same problem?
Speaker 2: With modern medicine?  Probably, probably, but, you know.  But the doctors did the best that they could; I mean it's just, you know, it was, you know, removing bone spurs from the ankles, you know, it's like get--you getting your car dirty, you clean it and it get dirty again, and that's exactly what happened with me and my injury.  They removed the bone spurs--the chips from there but, you know, you continue playing--wear and tear--it accumulates again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Does it bother you now at all?
Speaker 2: No, not at all 'cause I don't run and jump anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm walking on a treadmill or--but I don't play the game anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I have to ask you about that later, I guess, but--okay, so--with the Hornets, how is it when you have a--so, your value to a team at a certain point when you are not--you're no longer necessarily the physical one that you were coming out of college [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], and so you, you can't do some of the things physically but you, you--I mean you still can do some of 'em but not, not all of 'em (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you're compensating, and how you compensate is, you know, you know, instead of jumping high over the rim for the ball, you, you position yourself better, you know.  Instead of you shooting that fifteen, seventeen foot jump shot, you try to get closer and make an easier shot.  But you're not getting upset 'cause you're not playing your minutes that you was hoping to play--you accept it and just be a mentor and tutor the young guys that's up and coming, and that's what I was able to do with the, with the Charlotte Hornets, I think.  I was--I accepted my role.  They wanted me to be a positive teammate for Alonzo Mourning.
Story_ID: 626886
Speaker 1: Now that's a special role.  I haven't--I, I have to think about--you know; as these things come up, I start reflecting on what I read back in those days.  But Alonzo Mourning, from what I remember--correct me if I'm wrong--was seen as a tremendous young athletic talent, you know, in basketball.  A tremendous player, but they always talked about this seething anger--attitude that he had, or something that had to--they was always writing about.  Now I don't know--
Speaker 2: I never seen it personally when I played with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I saw a, a, a player--a, a kid in Alonzo that--a fierce competitor.  A lot of people could misconstrue that because how he never smiled on the court; he was all business.  I saw how he prepared.  Every day, before practice, he was on the side court working on his left hand, right hand jump hooks.  After practice, he spent an extra twenty minutes doing the same thing.  I know 'cause I, I, you know, I was there to shag the balls for him and to correct him in his techniques.  And after he do that, he goes, you know--will go right in the weight room and lift some weights, you know--spend about an hour in there lifting weights, you know.  When I played with him, I just saw someone who was a fierce competitor--never backed down from anything, and had the--eager and a--and desire to win.  He wanted to do whatever it took to win, and he had a great teammate in Larry Johnson, you know.  Larry--you know, we all know the type a player Larry was for the NBA [National Basketball Association]--for the Charlotte Hornets back then.  I thought they complemented each other very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So--but I don't know; they, they, they used to almost think--they make you think that he was some kind of time bomb or something.
Speaker 2: Well, again, because they--you know, he never smiled; he was all business, you know.  I think that's something that--you know, being under the tutelage of John Thompson, you know; you look at any--all his players, all his players never smiled, they were--when they stepped in between the lines, they were all business.  Patrick Ewing never smiled, you know.  Patrick was all--all his players, you know; that's something that I think--Thompson, Coach Thompson engrained in his players, when you step in between those lines, it's all business.  You're gonna have your fun but it's gonna be business, and don't--you don't have to be smiling at the cameras and everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's just my opinion.
Story_ID: 626887
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were, you were there [Charlotte Hornets] for a year--I guess that first year, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then you were traded to the 76ers [Philadelphia 76ers], right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Right.
Speaker 1: And so--and that was your last NBA [National Basketball Association] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I didn't make it outta camp.  My bone spurs was just flaring up on me, and the doctor said I would have to have another--more surgeries, you know, to remove the chips again, and just--that's when I decided that this is it.
Speaker 1: I've often wondered how somebody makes that decision to retire.  Is it, is it because it doesn't seem likely that somebody else would give you a contract?  Or do you just feel that--is there something else that you can do that make that much money, 'cause that's a lot of money that they pay you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know, so I don't know how you even choose to re- they'd have to make me--you know--I mean I think the average person looks at it and say, "Well, they--they'd have to stop me, you know, rather than me walk away from that kind of money" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, at that time, you know, I had other options that I was looking forward to anyway, being the fact that since I couldn't make the roster on that 76ers team, I had other options, and I was eager to move back to Las Vegas [Nevada] and start my business being a concessionaire at the airport--Ethel M's Chocolate [Ethel M Chocolates].  I was their first minority owned franchisee for their candy store at the airport, and I fulfilled that objective and it was a wonderful experience.  And during that time, also, I got the coaching bug, you know.  Back then, UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] was looking for a head coaching job, you know, with all the trauma that--drama that was going on then.  I was runner up for the--for that next head coaching position and, and unfortunately, I didn't get it, but it inspired me to, to, you know, keep my name out there and to try to be a head coach at any other school that would give me an opportunity.
Speaker 1: And in 1994--well, let me just make a note here that we're not talking about money.  And you were making like a million and a half dollars, it says, by the time you left basketball.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of money for most of us, but you had a--okay--'cause you, you had invested in a business at the airport and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had a concession stand.  They was looking for a minority franchisee, who had the reputation of credibility, to be their first franchisee, Ethel M's Chocolate; it's a subsidiary of Mars corporation [Mars, Inc.], and they wanted to expand their, their franchises throughout the country, and they chose me.  I inquired, I--and I was able to be their one and only.  I don't know if they had--you know, they decided not to pursue it anymore, but one and only franchisee in the family's history.
Story_ID: 626888
Speaker 1: In '94 [1994], something happened that is really remarkable, considering the great players they had at UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], but you were selected as a first player in UNLV history to have his jersey retired.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was--to this day, I'm thankful for that.  Actually, they wanted to do it the year that I--my senior year--after my senior year--but I asked if I could have it done after I finished playing, and in '94 [1994], you know, we all know I was done.  So they asked me again, and at--at that time, they were going, you know, with the--Coach Tarkanian [Jerry Tarkanian] resigning for, you know, their accusations, et cetera, et cetera.  They asked me, and some people in the community at that time didn't want me to because what they did to Coach--what happened to Coach Tarkanian, but my objective was to try to bridge the gap and bring everyone in together, to help people understand that, with all due respect to Coach Tarkanian, this university is gonna be here, and it's for the, the present and the future student athletes that will walk through this program.  And I decided to have it retired that year, in hopes that it would bridge the community--bring everyone together; and, to this day I'm, I'm glad I chose to do it that day 'cause my kids [LaShawn Green and Taurean Green] were small, and my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] was able to witness it and, you know, that was another proud moment for my mother to experience with, with her baby.
Story_ID: 626889
Speaker 1: What I haven't mentioned so far is that part of your NBA [National Basketball Association] career was like doing things for the community.  I mean right now you're ambassador for the Chicago Bulls.  You--you're--so you've been out in the community doing things since you--I mean from the beginning, right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --of your NBA career.  So, tell us about some of the things that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I love giving back, you know.  What I do here in the community in Chicago [Illinois], or throughout the--
Speaker 1: Well, just kind of give us a history of that.  What, what proj- what did you first start getting involved in in terms of community activity, back when you started with the Bulls way back when (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I used to do a lot of that, being a student athlete at UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada]; I used to go in the neighborhoods and share my story of what it took for me to become the success that I was, as far as being a student athlete in high school, All-American, et cetera, et cetera, to those kids in the City of Las Vegas [Nevada] and, you know, I decided that if--back then, if I should ever make the NBA, I would like to give back to the city that I--of the team and organization that I represent and, you know, I, I like to do speaking engagements because I have a story to tell in hopes of inspiring and motivating another Sidney Greens [HistoryMaker Sidney Green] that's coming up, and just--it's just something that's within me and that's something that was--and that my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green] said that it's best to do--for us to give back and be a helping hand for, for others.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--I mean--now I know there's some specific projects that you, that you initiated.  Can you tell us about some of those?
Speaker 2: Surely, yeah.  Well, I don't have them anymore.  I have my own foundation.  When I was living in Las Vegas, it was Shoot for the Stars Foundation that me and some friends of mines, we co-founded, and that's to--that was to help the inner city kids; give them an opportunity to go to a basketball camp and experience firsthand of, of, of NBA players, baseball players--teaching them the fundamentals of not only basketball, but life.  When I was with the Orlando Magic, I had Sid's Kids, and that was pretty much similar as well to Shoot for the Stars Foundation.  I was able to provide tickets for minority kids, kids that live in the community, to attend a game, meet the players, to pretty much, you know, hope--in hopes that it would inspire them to excel well in school, and all that was predicated on attendance and, you know, recommendations from the teachers, and we got such positive feedback from that.  And when I got traded from the Magic, I wanted--everyone wanted to keep it going, but I wasn't there physically in the city to keep it going.  And, you know, right now I'm working for the Chicago Bulls of being an ambassador, you know.  It's a--it's an honor and privilege to be in this position because Mr. Reinsdorf [Jerry Reinsdorf] and his family see something in me that I can give back.  They see a talent that I have that I can spread my, my knowledge, experience to, to the kids in the community and, and also Corporate America as well.
Story_ID: 626890
Speaker 1: I'm getting back to the Bulls [Chicago Bulls], but I wanted to ask you about some of your college coaching activities and stuff that you've--you've been like a--I think starting in '95 [1995] you've, you've, you've been a college coach, right?  Off and on.
Speaker 2: Southampton College [Stony Brook Southampton, Southampton, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is correct.  Being since I was runner up for the UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] position and I decided to leave the business world of being a franchisee at the airport in Las Vegas [for Ethel M Chocolates], I got the coaching bug and I wanted to be a head coach.  I didn't wanna be an assistant coach for any college or organization--professional organization, and riding back from Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] to Florida, I saw an opportunity in Southampton that the coach was fired and--on the plane, actually, and I--when the plane landed, when I got home, I did some research at the schools in Southampton, New York, and did some more research of why the coach got fired, et cetera, et cetera as a Division II school, and I, I asked, I asked--one of my mentors at that time was Coach Pitino [Rick Pitino]; I called and asked him about it and, you know, he, he got the 411 for me and tried to convince me not to take it because of, you know, it's a school that's--a bad school that's not funded and, you know, it's not being supported by the community and--but I told him I wanted to be a head coach.  He said, "You could be an NBA [National Basketball Association] coach--assistant coach and work at--."  I said, "No, coach, I wanna be a head coach."  And it was a challenging opportunity for me, and I've been challenged all my life, and I said, "Coach, if it's that bad, okay?  I don't think I need you to make a call for me--I got this."  And I accepted the position, and one good thing about is that we made it.  I don't like to put it all on me 'cause I had a great, loyal, committed staff with me to help make it better, not only on the basketball court, but the players as well.  We was able to focus them to where they could get their education like they were supposed to, representing the school as a student athlete, so we made it better.  And, you know, I, I left my family in Florida and moved to Southampton to get that done, and I, I decided to make a lateral movement to University of North Florida [Jacksonville, Florida], and they came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you could be closer to your family (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I could be closer to my family (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Well, let me just point out that at Southampton, the team won six games before you showed up, and then they--you took 'em to sixteen and thirteen; then you took 'em to thirteen and fourteen the second year.  So, you had a--about a .500--little better than .500 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and it was, it was tough, but it was great.  There was no support at all in the community; there was people in it--in the business community that didn't even know about a Southampton basketball team, and we increased attendance 100 percent (laughter) and, you know, we were the talk a the town for those two years.  We made it better, and most importantly, we was able to put those kids, the student athletes, on the right track of getting their degrees.
Speaker 1: It says here that six of eleven players were named to the honor roll.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Hm.  That's, that's interesting, yeah.
Speaker 2: Correct.  We--there was mandatory study hall, and my philosophy was if you didn't go to class--if you don't practice, if you don't practice, you don't play, and we was a stickler on that.  Coach Green [HistoryMaker Sidney Green] was a stickler on that, and the kids they, they responded in a positive way.
Story_ID: 626891
Speaker 1: So, University of North Florida [Jacksonville, Florida], 1997.  You're thirty-six years old, okay?  So, what happened there?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a great opportunity.  I wanted--for one thing, I wanted to be closer and back with my family, and I resigned my position at Southampton [Southampton College; Stony Brook Southampton, Southampton, New York], and an opportunity came my way for not only--before North Florida there was a school in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida]--Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University] came after me and wanted me to uplift their program like how we did at Southampton, but North Florida came after me also, and I had both offers on the table.  I decided University of North Florida because of the president, Dr. Adam Herbert [Adam W. Herbert]; he was a remark- he convinced me and he showed me the light of fulfilling my dreams of being a Division I coach if I go through that route instead of going through Bethune-Cookman route.  And, you know, it was challenging there at University of North Florida because the academic prerequisite that a student athlete must have.  You must have a--in order enough to attain a scholarship to be a student athlete there, you must have a 3.0 and a--a--grade point average, and score over 1,000 on your SATs, and that was--it was tough.  The, the tough, tough part about it also was that schools in our conference didn't have that pre-requisite to, to recruit a student athlete, so there was many, many student athletes that we had to turn down that decided to go to schools in our conference because they didn't have that academic criteria to meet our standards.  So that was the tough thing about it, but we were still able to make it better than before we got there.  And I was there for two years, and from the success that we had there, we were able to move on to my Division I dream of being a Division I head coach.
Story_ID: 626892
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is to Florida Atlantic [Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida], right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--all right.  So, what happened there?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a--it was another call that I made to Coach Pitino [Rick Pitino] and he gave me everything else but, but the kitchen sink, figuratively, about how bad the school was as far as being supported in the community.  Out of two hundred and--out of three hundred schools--Division I schools ranked nationally--that was the--FAU at that time was like 290 and, you know the--you know how unsupportive everyone is about--for the school in the community, et cetera--limited resource--why should I take it?  And again, it was another challenge for me.  It was a Division I school, and it was in Boca Raton [Florida].  But again, I had to sacrifice my family again because I wanted them to have--wanted my kids [LaShawn Green and Taurean Green] to be able to graduate outta high school in Orlando [Florida]; that's where we--so I accepted it and I--before I accepted, I gave the president a five year plan of what it would take for, for us to be successful, and to win our conference and advance to, you know, to the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association], and instead of us accomplishing that goal in five years, we were able to do it within three.  First year was, was the worse coaching experience I ever had.  We won only two games.  It was pretty tough.  And the second year we won, I believe, nine; and in the third year we were able to win our conference championship and advance to the NCAA.  So, we fulfilled that goal in three years outta the five year plan I gave him.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the--what was the--briefly, what was the five year plan?
Speaker 2: The five year was for us to bring in--well, the--to graduate the kids that were there already.  We never wanna get rid of a kid unless the kid get rid of themselves and, and I wanted to impose my rule of being a student athlete and what it took to be a student athlete to represent the school, and that some kids won't abide by it out of experience, and I was on, on target with that, and for me to bring in my type of student athletes that I wanted to represent the school, the basketball program, and their families accordingly.  Of me getting community support--going to various corporations, of putting money into the program 'cause we, we had a limited budget--shoestring budget.  And also, I wanted to help the other pro- athletic programs as well, the women's basketball program and the track teams, et cetera, by garnering community support.  And I just went and knocked on doors--me and my staff, and we brought 'em in and brought in a lot of money to offset the various other teams in that, in that university.
Story_ID: 626893
Speaker 1: Florida Atlantic made the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] in 2001-2002 season, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So, 2002.  And so how did you all do?
Speaker 2: We lost in the first round to Alabama--University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay, Alabama (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were sixteenth--we were sixteenth; Alabama was the number one seed; we was the sixteenth seed, and we was up by two points at halftime (laughter).  Unfortunately, we lost, but I tell you, the--we, we almost beat 'em.  It was a wonderful experience for our kids; they, they never fathomed that they would ever get this opportunity to play an NCAA tournament, especially against the number one ranked team.  It was great; it was a wonderful moment.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, this is--yeah.  I know they often say like the, the attraction of March Madness is that a, a school, you know, the size of Florida Atlantic can make the tournament and--because basketball--five guys against five guys, it's--things can happen.
Speaker 2: Well, the joy also of it was the fact that what we were able to generate for Florida Atlantic University [Boca Raton, Florida].  One thing was priceless; you couldn't put a price tag on the type of publicity that our school got worldwide, the fact that--again, as I mention, our kids never fathom of 'em ever playing before a CBS audience.  It was their dream, of course, and we--they--we were able to fulfill it for them.  And, and, and again, the dollar value that we was able to bring Florida Atlantic University, the City of Boca [Boca Raton, Florida], you know.  Again, you're talking about a team, as I mentioned earlier, that was ranked 290 out of 300 Division I schools when I took over the program.  And, and again, I couldn't do it myself; I had such a solid staff, a trusted staff in regards to us getting it done the right way.  We have never broken an NCAA rule; we did it the right way, and I'm so proud of that accomplishment for what we have done for that school.
Speaker 1: Who were your leaders on the court?
Speaker 2: Oh!  I can name--besides every last one a the kids 'cause I put the responsibilities on them to be a leader for themselves--of leading themselves to be a student athlete--
Story_ID: 626894
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about March Madness in 2002.
Speaker 2: Well, it was a wonderful, wonderful experience for us all; our student athletes--our players was just overjoyed from the accomplishment that we achieved that year, first of winning our conference tournament, which enabled us to, to play in a NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] tournament and, and we played--we was--we played the number one seeded team, which was Alabama--the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama]; we was seeded sixteen, and we was up at halftime by a few points; if only the game would've been over that time--at that time (laughter), but it was a wonderful, wonderful accomplishment of what we achieved that year because from, from my five year plan we was able to accomplish it in three years, and also the dollar value that we were able to bring the university, Florida Atlantic University [Boca Raton, Florida], far as the exposure--the publicity that the school got worldwide on our accomplishment--I mean they had, you know, CBS cameras that week prior to the game on campus just interviewing our student athletes on how happy they were, and it was just a wonderful moment of just coaching, and coaching against a, a, a team like Alabama.  It's a unfortunate thing we lost, but we were able to go to the big dance, and our players really danced 'cause they had a wonderful time, and I'm sure it's something that they won't ever, ever forget, and also, as I mentioned earlier, the, the, the, the exposure--you couldn't put a dollar value on that--on, on what we brought the university.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is a David versus Goliath contest.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: The, the last seed against the top seed.
Speaker 2: Exactly, and that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so, what, what did--was the final score?  Did you lose by much?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember the final score, but we lost by a few points, maybe ten points--nine, ten points, or something like that.  But it wasn't an embarrassing defeat, you know.  We played hard for forty minutes; Alabama just had more talent than us and--but this is something--again, as I told our players, to this day and, and I get letters from former student athletes to this day whenever the--especially when the, you know, big dance come around, you know, the--that's all they think about is that moment--that moment of experience that they had in they life.  And it helped them be--to become a success in what they doing, you know; they're, they're working now, they're proud citizens, have their own family, and they reflect back on their experience of being coached by me. (Cough) Excuse me.
Speaker 1: And (unclear) ten years ago.  So, who were the leaders on that team--of the students (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Every last one of the players were leaders, but I had two outstanding guards--Earnest Crumbley [Earnest Crumbley, Jr.] from St. Petersburg [Florida] and--he was an outstanding point guard; he's tenacious--had a, had a heart; well, every last one of my players had a big heart, but he was a remarkable player for us for four years.  He was a player that, that I personally recruited.  His father [Earnest Crumbley, Sr.] is a college coach--a junior college coach also.  We had a, a Jeff Cowans from Orlando [Florida] (cough) excuse me, and he was an outstanding shooter--two guard for us, great student athlete.  We had Robert Williams from--where is he from?  He's from Florida as well; he was our big man that just, just--talk about a kid that came in with less talent but left with more talent than what he came in with; he was a big guy in the middle.  We just had a wonderful team and, and every last one of our player accepted, accepted their role that was bestowed upon them, and that's what made us so successful that year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now, now you were there for two more years.  The team wasn't quite as successful.  Was there any particular--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  We was going through a transition with--we had a new athletic director and they, they decided that they didn't wanna put into what we accomplished in regards to uplifting the--keeping the program at that level that we brought 'em to, and a few players--student athletes that we were recruiting that year decided to go elsewhere because they didn't know if Coach Green [HistoryMaker Sidney Green] was coming back 'cause I was a target for other various schools in the country, and by them waiting to resign my contract, unfortunately at that moment the, the kids that we were targeting decided to go, so we lost a huge recruiting class that year.  And we struggled that following year, and after that second year, I decided that it was, it was time to move on to my next phase of life.
Story_ID: 626895
Speaker 1: Two thousand four [2004], the year you left [Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida], is the year that your, your son, Taurean [Taurean Green], plays for the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida], right?  He starts there--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: This--well, go ahead, I'll--
Speaker 2: No, I'm saying--just by you mentioning his name, you know, my heart start palpitating because I'm so proud of him and what he have accomplished thus far.
Speaker 1: Now he, he--his team won the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] championship, didn't they?
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they beat the great Ohio State Buckeyes [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], I think, for the championship in 2006 or 2007?
Speaker 2: Two thousand six [2006], yeah.
Speaker 1: Two thousand six [2006], okay.  And I was in Ohio crying watching that game (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but we were watching (unclear) and thinking they were, they were gonna do something--that Greg Oden and John Conley [sic. Mike Conley, Jr.] and, you know--great team, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that was a wonderful experience.  And those next two years after I resigned--well, that next year, I went to play for Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana]--I mean coached at Indiana as an assistant coach to Mike Davis, and the following year I decided to just take a whole year and just experience those moments that my son and that wonderful team that he played for at University of Florida win another championship.
Speaker 1: Now, the current Bulls [Chicago Bulls] center, Joakim Noah, was on that team, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Joakim is like in a--like a son to me, also.  He--him and my son are like brothers, and he's a great player, outstanding human being, have a wonderful heart.  He's from a solid family; his mother [Cecilia Rodhe] and his father are successful; his dad was a great tennis player.
Speaker 1: Yannick Noah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Yannick Noah and--yeah, Joakim is a--and I'm so proud that I'm still around to see him develop not only as a basketball player, but as a person as well, for our organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your, your son now he--is he still playing pro ball?  Now he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's playing professional basketball overseas.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause he played for the Trail Blazers [Portland Trail Blazers] and the Knicks [New York Knicks], I think, before going to Turkey.  I think he's playing in Turkey now.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626896
Speaker 1: Now, how did you become--how'd you get the current position with the Chicago Bulls?  I mean you played for them a long time ago, and so well what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, they say life goes in full circles.  I got a telephone call from Mr. Reinsdorf asking me to come by, if I would be interested in coming and helping him win some more championships, and being since I knew Joakim Noah, his traits also, for me to come and, you know, help him on the basketball court.  Without any hesitation, I accepted his offer, and I was coaching for one year; I coached Joakim as a big man's coach--specialty coach--for one year for the Bulls, and Vinny Del Negro was the coach and, you know, for that one year.  Decision was made on Vinny Del Negro, and we decided to bring in another coach who is now our current coach, Coach Thibodeau [Tom Thibodeau], and during that transition, I was asked if I wanted to move up into the business part of the organization as a team ambassador and, again without hesitation, I accepted the offer.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what is the position of team ambassador?  Now we know you're a coach, we know you understand basketball from the coaching perspective and all that but, but what's a team ambassador?
Speaker 2: It's doing a lot of community relations work, keeping our corporate sponsors happy, and just opening doors for us in attaining more corporate sponsorships for our organization, you know--making sure that they're, they're happy and we're fulfilling our obligation to them once they become under our umbrella, you know.  The, the most joyful part also, in this position, is of me going out speaking to the kids, to various companies, about our organization and the character that we have on our team and also in our department as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started this position in 2009, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how many, how many people do the Bulls employ in the front office?  I know we all see the ballplayers and the coaches, but how many people are behind the scenes?
Speaker 2: We have a total of about eighty--between eighty and eighty-five, yeah, within the organization, and it's a, it's a--and it's very close, very tight, and it's run extremely well.  We have a new president/COO, Michael Reinsdorf, who was handed the reins by his dad, Jerry Reinsdorf, about a year and a half ago, and he's doing a remarkable job, and he's just keeping it going, you know.  Our objective, as I mentioned earlier, is for us to just--you know, we have six championships now under Michael--from Michael Jordan, now we wanna get six more, but the most important thing right now is that first one, and I personally feel we have a great opportunity this year, 2012, to win this championship plus many more, from--with the leadership of Derrick Rose.
Story_ID: 626897
Speaker 1: Now, your or--now what is your--I know you're asked this--as an ambassador for the Bulls [Chicago Bulls], I'm sure you're asked this all the time.  Like what's your analysis of your current team?  What's the--you know, you mentioned Derrick Rose; he's a big star from Chicago [Illinois] here, but what do you think about your team?
Speaker 2: I think with this sixty-six game season we have because of the strike this year, I think we're doing well.  I think we have a legitimate chance of winning the championship this year because of what we have, not only in Derrick Rose, but the coaching that we're getting.  I think we have a solid coach in Coach Thibodeau [Tom Thibodeau], I think he's a, a coach who has a formula on what it takes to win a championship.  He waited twenty years to be in this position, and we have such outstanding players surrounded by Derrick Rose as well, that accept their roles and to have true character of what it take to represent the game both on and off the basketball court.  So I think we're--you know, everybody talk about the team up--down south over there in Miami [Florida], but I, I personally think we have a better team, and we will always--'cause we gon- we gonna continue to build and, and get better each year.
Speaker 1: And speaking for the armchair coaches and guys that watch the game and still try to play themselves on pickup games on the weekend, when we look at the Bulls, I mean the Bulls have--the front office has done a remarkable job because, you know, it's one thing to have Derrick Rose, but when you have like Corey Brewer, C.J. Watson--the guys that are playing the roles on the team, are--seem to be remarkable guys (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  I agree with you 100 percent on that and, and I attribute that to coaching, you know.  Thibodeau have come in with the formula and the command of respect from the first day, and to this day the respect is still there.  And, you know, the character of players that we were able to bring into the organization by trades and draft, I commend that effort to John Paxson and Gar Forman, and we're building not only for the present, but we're also building for the future, and I see nothing but better days ahead for our Chicago Bulls organization, with the leadership that we're having.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're, we're on a--we're coming up on the playoffs--NBA playoffs, and the Bulls have the best record in basketball right now.
Speaker 2: Yes, we do.
Speaker 1: So, so it's--your prospects look good.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Thank you.  And someone asked me on the way in--someone noticed me and asked me, you know, "Why are we starting the games off?"  I said, "Look, we still have the best record in the NBA [National Basketball Association]; just relax, okay?  The--you know--season is winding down and we're getting ready for the playoffs but, you know, why complain and we have the best record in the NBA?"  We wanna make it better, of course; everybody commands perfection but then again, we still have the best record, and we gonna get even better.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's puzzling in the news that people are upset that we lost the other night to the Washington Wizards who have one of the worst records, but I mean Derrick Rose has got some nagging injuries he's trying to heal up, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Luol Deng (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sat out.
Speaker 1: --sat out, too.
Speaker 2: Well, again, this is the NBA and you can be--you can get beaten any, any night.  Any night you can--'cause you playing against the best players in the world, so, you know, true; of, of course if Rose and Deng would've--would, would, would have played, it probably would have been a different outcome, but you can get beat any given night by the worst teams in the NBA; that's why you gotta be prepared, which we're prepared every game.  You just have to be mentally ready every game and, you know, probably we weren't like we should have been, but that's part of the NBA.
Speaker 1: As [HistoryMaker] Sidney Green looking at this right now, I mean who do you think--and I don't know what people will make of this 100 years from now (laughter), with us talking about this, but who do you see as the team that's--the Bulls definitely is--has to get past to win the championship?
Speaker 2: The year 2012, on the East Coast--the Eastern Conference I would have to say we can't sleep on the Celtics [Boston Celtics], okay; the Celtics will always have an outstanding team.  This year they have a great team in their veteran players, Kevin Garnett leading 'em.  On the western side--Western Conference, we can't sleep on Oklahoma [Oklahoma City Thunder], but also we can't sleep on the San Antonio Spurs; they're, they're gonna be a, a team to be reckon with, especially in the playoffs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you have any analysis on the Miami Heat at this point?
Speaker 2: Great team, great team, great players, but I think we have the better team.  They have great players in LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, and--but I feel--you have those great players, those three, but I feel overall, we have the better team.  I think we have a better coach in Thibodeau in what he commands and get out of his players.
Story_ID: 626898
Speaker 1: Now, tell me this.  Now, what are your--what do you see as your prospects in the future?  Do you see yourself, you know, moving into a higher level management on a team?  If not the Bulls, some other team, or--
Speaker 2: I wanna continue to get better every day, I wanna continue to learn the business of basketball and the NBA [National Basketball Association], I wanna continue to build the confidence in, in Jerry Reinsdorf and his family on being, and continue being affiliated with the Chicago Bulls.  I really don't wanna work for any other organization 'cause I enjoy what I do.  I--we're--Jerry Reinsdorf, the family, on a name on my chest in regards to bringing out the best in me, so I see myself continuing to be the better person than I am today and, hopefully, one day of--I mean one day running an organization--being a general manager.  I wanna be the best that I can be and, you know, you can learn--you, you can learn, you can learn from the likes of John Paxson and what he's doing, and also from Gar Forman--to seeing what they're doing and how they're constructing this team and where it was several years ago to where it is right now.  You never know, so I'm just, just visualizing and learning from them.  You never know of me one day becoming a, a general manager in hopes of a--with the Chicago Bulls, or with any other NBA organization.
Story_ID: 626899
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: To continue to strive, to look at the present.  To learn from the past, look at the present, and have hope for the future of things being better than what it is today, not to forget the ones who struggled for us to be where we are today.  There's a famous saying also that I, I love to share with people by W.E.B. Du Bois [sic. Booker T. Washington], and he says: Success should not be judged by what you achieve, but it should be judged by the struggle for what it took for you to get there.  And we had a struggle, and we still are struggling, but we have to continue to make it better and not lose sight on the ones who paved the way for us to be where we are today.
Story_ID: 626900
Speaker 1: When you look back over your career to this point--and you're still young by the standards that we interview people, especially--what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy.  Wow!  I was able to overcome all the obstacles that came before me, especially growing up in Brooklyn [New York].  I was able to fulfill my dream of making it better for my mother [Lucretia Simmons Green], of being a father to my two kids [LaShawn Green and Taurean Green], a husband for my wife [Deidra Jackson Green], and for them to hopefully--in hopes to take it to the next level and not settle for anything less than what I have tried to provide and show them on being successful.  You mentioned about--earlier about my daughter, but I do have--my son, but I do have a daughter that's graduating from law school next month, and she--my kids are my passion that I live for today, and she's been my rock, along with my son, of course, but the both of them are my rock, and those two is really who I live for today.
Story_ID: 626901
Speaker 1: Now is--when you look back at the past, is there anything that you, that you, that you wish you had not done, or anything you would change if you could?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't change anything because if I (laughter)--you know, the past is the past, and you really can't look back as much, and just--you can learn from the past.  And the, the, the decisions that I made in life, to this point, I'm very happy with.  I, I have no animosity or grudges on anything that have came my way based on my decisions that I made.  I just really wanna continue to get better, to continue to grow, stay healthy, and be able to watch my kids [LaShawn Green and Taurean Green] formulate their family and be a, be a success in life--of giving back like I have tried to give back; of bringing happiness to people lives--other people lives.

Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered on--on what it took for me to become what I have became--the struggle of me not succumbing to the peer pressures, the pressure that I have encountered in life.  I'll like to be remembered as someone who was honest in my approach to, to being who I am today--of, of being a good husband, a good father, and a good person, and to continue to represent those who pretty much reached out and helped me become--to become the person that I, I am today--Mr. Reinsdorfs [Michael Reinsdorf and Jerry Reinsdorf].
