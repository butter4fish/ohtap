Speaker 2: Place of birth is Florence, South Carolina.  Date of birth is el-November 26, 1953.
Speaker 1: And, sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm sort of a jack-of-all-trades now.  I consider myself retired, but on the other hand, I'm executive director of the Fritz Pollard Alliance out of Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A sports consultant.  I can go on and on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--Fritz Pollard was the--one of the first black professional football players, right?
Speaker 2: Fritz, Fritz Pollard was a black coach in what became--he was the first black coach in what became the National Football League [NFL].  In 1925, the league was started, but Fritz Pollard coached in 1923.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He never really coached in the National Football League, but he was the first coach in what became the National Football League.
Speaker 1: Okay.  One of the early--he was a football player at one time, right?
Speaker 2: He was an All-American football player, quarterback, at Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].  He is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame [Canton, Ohio].  He was inducted in 2005, quarterback.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I'll ask you about that, the alliance at the end--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --a little more, but you are famous for--in New York City [New York, New York] here as being the former captain of the New York Giants, right?  And captain of the 1986 championship--NFL Super Bowl champion.
Speaker 2: I don't know how famous I am.  I'm just a guy who played football for the New York Giants.  I was fortunate enough to be able to meet the challenge and change to a different position, middle linebacker position, and then I played for thirteen seasons with the Giants, and then I walked away.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is September 1st, 2016.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: New York City.
Story_ID: 519481
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask and they only require a short answer.  First one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I guess my favorite food would be fried chicken, but I'm off of it for health reasons.  I would say potato salad and fried chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: All right.  Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year is spring.
Speaker 1: And favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Either Hawaii, or there's a place that my wife [Maribel Carson] and I go called Jumby Bay, off the coast of Antigua.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase or saying.  I would not categorize myself as having one, but there are people who have phrases about me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there--do you--can you give us one?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I have nicknames for all of my teammates.  My--all of my teammates have nicknames for me.  They call me Harry-O, they call me their captain as, as the book 'Captain For Life' ['Captain For Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson], they call me their captain for life.  You know, my grandkids call me Pop Pop.  You know, I go by all of those different names.
Story_ID: 519482
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of your family and your father's [Edgar Carson, Sr.] side.  I'm gonna start with your mother's side.  It's just what you can tell us.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Gladys Lee Eaddy Carson [Gladys Eaddy Carson], G-L-A-D-Y-S, L-E-E, E-A-D-D-Y, C-A-R--C-A-R-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth, December 25th, I think 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And was she born in Florence [South Carolina] as well?
Speaker 2: I believe so.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace them and what kind of work were they doing and--
Speaker 2: I can't really trace her roots back very far because I was the youngest of six.  My mother left the family when I was six years old to relocate out of the South to Newark, New Jersey for a better way of life.  As a kid, I didn't really spend a whole lot of time around the adults learning who was who.  She had a cousin; his name was Chalmers Eaddy.  She had a sister by the name of Jessie Mae Timmons.  My Aunt Jessie Mae had fourteen kids, and I think that's the extent of my knowledge of her background.  I got to know my cousins, but I never knew my grandfathers or grandmothers because, as I said, I was the last one of six and, unfortunately, I didn't spend a whole lot of time, you know, quizzing my family members as to who was who.  I was just sort of living my own life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any traditions in the family passed down that go all the way back to the Civil War or any of those situations?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think there are any things that were passed down.  You know, we were from the South, and I would say that we as a family, the Carson family, we lived in the city part of the country (laughter).  So, I got to go to my aunt's house because they were sharecroppers.  They did tobacco, cotton.  That's where we would go to get fresh vegetation.  We'd get chickens or whatever and then, you know, we'd come home and, you know, I'd make friends with the chicken and then the chicken would be our dinner.  So, you know, it was just that connection that I felt to my mother's sister and her family, and I really didn't as a youth dig into the history of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: It has been--I mean, it's been shared with me when I sit down and I talk to older members of my family, my sisters, my older brother.  They were more of the care--they were the keepers of that knowledge and, quite frankly, as I said before, I didn't really dig until it was probably too late, when they were older.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we always ask--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause some people know some things and some don't and there may be some little story that may shed light on what our people were doing at a certain point in time.  You know, these are--I know South Carolina was a rough place for black folks and it's also a place where the majority of the population was black at one time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, there's a lot of rich history there and stories that we may take for granted.  That's why I always ask (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 519483
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Gladys Eaddy Carson] get a chance to go to school and--
Speaker 2: My mother went to school.  I think she probably got an eighth grade education.  I just remember my mother working at the Florence Country Club [Florence, South Carolina].  She was a cook at the Florence Country Club, and she would go to work every day and then she'd come home and she'd bring food that was not eaten at the country club and bring it home, and that's what we would have to eat.  And then, you know, one day she came to the family and she said that she was leaving, and she wanted me to know how much she loved me.  And I know it had to be painful for her to leave her children, and me being the youngest, at about the age of five or six, to relocate to Newark, New Jersey.  There was a tremendous void that I felt.  When my mother was leaving, I'll never forget, she always--she came to me and she said, "Son, learn how to take care of yourself."  That's the thing that sort of resonates when I--when I think of my mother.  That's probably the wisest advice that she's ever given me.  Learn how to take care of yourself.
Speaker 1: Now, let me maybe explore this a little bit.  Now, did she have a job waiting?  Was she invited to go to Newark by an employer?  Is that what--
Speaker 2: I don't know if she had a job, but she became a domestic--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and she was working in--at the homes of different people in and around Newark whether it be Montclair [New Jersey] or Verona, New Jersey.  She became the caretaker for those families that she worked for.
Speaker 1: Did she have a sister there or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --any other relatives in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: No, she just--she knew different people and I guess they reached out to her and said, you know, you should come up here, and she left the family.  There wasn't anything wrong between my mother and my father [Edgar Carson, Sr.], it was just, you know, if she was going to take care of the family, she had to do it outside of Florence, South Carolina.  There was--there was really nothing for her except being a cook.
Story_ID: 519484
Speaker 1: You're the youngest--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) and how much older is the oldest sibling?
Speaker 2: The oldest--I was--there was three boys and three girls.  The oldest probably would be about eighty right now, my brother, but he passed away several years ago.
Speaker 1: So that's like seventeen years older than you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, well--if you wouldn't mind, like, naming the rest of them in--you know, just in order and--we usually have people do that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My oldest brother, his name was Edgar Charles Carson.  He was the oldest.  We called him Sonny [Sonny Carson].  The next was Ruth Delores Carson.  We called her Ruth [Ruth Carson].  The next was Louise Carson [Louise Carson Ham].  We called her Bae-Bae [ph.].  The next was Loretta Carson [Loretta Carson Dowling].  We called her Rhettie.  The next was Douglas Carson, a brother.  We called him Ronnie, Douglas Ronald Carson [Ronnie Carson].  And he passed away--we were four years apart and he passed away about four or five years ago.  And then me.
Speaker 1: And they called you Don-Don, right, from what I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Called me Don-Don, yeah.
Speaker 1: --what I remember from the book ['Captain for Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 519485
Speaker 1: Now, your mother [Gladys Eaddy Carson], from what I understand from reading the book ['Captain for Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson], she loved you very much and she was--but for her to make that move, it seems incongruent with--and at the time--well, the first chapter of the book is called "Mama's Boy" 'cause you were a--you were a mama's boy, basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, in writing that book, there was so much more that I had in the book and I submitted it to my agent, and he said, you know, "That first chapter is a bit long," and I was a little offended because I was writing my life, and I knew what my life was and I wanted to share my life with the reader.  But, that agent felt that it was too long.  That information that I put in there would give the reader a much deeper insight as to why I am the person that I am, you know, what or who I was raised around, the love of my family, and especially my mother.  I was born at home.  I weighed ten and a half pounds or more, so I had to be probably the last one, but I just remember the unconditional love that she had for me.  Up until the day she passed away, I would still sit in her lap 'cause she always considered me to be her baby.  And, you know, that's--you know, that's one of the things I miss tremendously, and that's the love of my mother.
Speaker 1: So, this is even when you were 6'2", two--what--
Speaker 2: I was in the National--I was playing in the National Football League [NFL] and, you know, I was still sitting in my mother's lap.  Now, I mean, that's what she wanted.  I mean, she would--she--one of the things that I do is, I cook, and I love cooking for people, and I inherited that from my mother.  And I'm very meticulous when I get in the kitchen and I don't want anyone in there just as my mother was.  She didn't want anyone in her way.  You go and do whatever you have to do.  She was in the cook--in the kitchen cooking the chicken and frying stuff, and collards and cabbage and beans and rice and biscuits and all of that stuff.  And she would put a whole feast of a meal together, and everything would be hot.  And then she'd call everybody, you know, "Food's ready."  The one way that you would offend her is if you took your time to get to the table because, you know, you ignoring her and she has already said the dinner is ready, it's like an insult.  And so I'm sort of the same way.  I enjoy cooking for my family.  I enjoy just being in the kitchen because it brings out that, that tie that I had to my mother and just being in the kitchen, watching her when she'd make a cake and she would allow me to lick the bowl.  You know, those are the things that keep me close to my mother.  Just--when I feed people, I feel like I'm--I feel like they are experiencing my love through my mother whenever I cook meals.  So, that's the thing that I feel has been handed down from me to--from my mother to me.  But the other thing that has, in my opinion, been handed down is the unconditional love that I have for my family, especially my children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you did get a chance to see your mother when she would visit or you would go to New Jersey sometimes, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--you know, my first visit to Newark, New Jersey was when I was at the age of ten, and my father [Edgar Carson, Sr.] worked for the railroad, and so we were able to get passes to travel on the railroad.  And I went to Newark in 1963 and it was like, wow.  You know, because I saw all these tall buildings.  In Florence [South Carolina], I think the tallest building might have been five stories.  And I went to Newark and I saw the buildings that were there and I got to meet different people and, you know, I got to see an altogether different world.  And so, you know, my brother [Ronnie Carson] and I, and my sister, Loretta [Loretta Carson Dowling], would come to Newark during the summer and we'd spend time, you know, just being with my mother.  And so I might spend a few weeks and then come back home, get ready to go to school.
Story_ID: 519486
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father.  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Edgar Charles Carson, Sr., E-D-G-A-R, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, C-A-R-S-O-N [Edgar Carson, Sr.].  My father, as I mentioned, worked on the railroad, and he is originally from Georgia.  I can't give you an exact place where he lived, but I have visited with family members, I would say in the Macon, Georgia area.  But then there were other relatives in other parts of Georgia where he could have been raised at.  Ironically, I probably know less about my father's background because very seldom did we meet individuals who were his descendants.  I never met my grandmother, never met my grandfather, but I did meet some of his cousins.  My father, as I said, he worked on the railroad.  He was in maintenance.  At some point, he left the railroad, and then he opened a bar in Florence [South Carolina] and it was one of these little juke joints.  And then he became a taxi driver and, you know, that's about it.  My father, you know, I learned a lot about--I learned a lot from my father that I carry with me.  It may not necessarily be the same as my mother [Gladys Eaddy Carson], but my father was, he was--you know, he had some issues.  He was an alcoholic.  And, you know, growing up in the South, I used to fix my own bottle, and I'd go out and sit on the steps and watch people go to work in the morning and--
Speaker 1: This is a real little--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I'd--I was like three or four, and I'd make my own bottle, Carnation evaporated milk.  I'd get my bottle and I'd go sit on the porch and while everybody else might be asleep, and I'd watch people going to work.  That was during the week.  But then on Friday, I'd see people coming home from work, and many of these people, especially the men, would make a stop before they'd get home, and they'd stop at someone's house, and they'd have a drink and drink too much, and they would wind up, you know, walking home, and they'd stagger home.  For every two steps that they took, they'd take a step back.  You know, I saw many of these men drink themselves to death, and I couldn't really understand why.  I saw fights between husbands and wives.  And my father was sort of like that.  He would stop and have a few drinks and then he'd come home, and then, you know, eventually, you know, we would go and, you know, use the water, and the water would be turned off, or we would try to turn the lights on, and the lights would be turned off, or we'd get like an eviction notice.  You know, you get like a yellow thing on the--on the door to vacate the property.  And I think that's why my mother had to leave because she had to take care of her family.
Story_ID: 519487
Speaker 1: Did she [Carson's mother, Gladys Eaddy Carson] send money back to the household (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she sent money back.  When the different families would give her items, she would put them in a box and put them on a Greyhound bus and send those items home.  And when I got big enough to wear some of the items, it was like--you know, it was--I felt great because I was getting lightly used stuff from other people.  I really didn't care, it was just--to me, it was new.  And, you know, watching what was going on.  And I--and, you know, when I was young, I really didn't have a good sense as to what was going on, it was just the way that we lived.  And I made a commitment to myself that I never wanted to be like that.  When I looked at my father [Edgar Carson, Sr.], and I only saw him drunk twice.  He--but, he drank a lot, but I only saw him drunk, like sprawled out drunk twice, and I always said I never want to be like that.
Speaker 1: How long did he have his juke joint?
Speaker 2: He probably had it for, you know, two or three years.  You know, I was just a kid who went there.  I remember the smell, the sights, you know, people would come, the music would be playing on the jukebox, you'd have somebody in the kitchen, you know, cooking barbecue.  But, I didn't spend a lot of time there, but, you know, I remember being there and, you know, the times that I was there very, very vivid.
Speaker 1: So, your father was the head of the household when your mother left.  Is that--is that true or would--or did one of your sisters or your brother like--
Speaker 2: I think--you know, my father was there, but I think my sisters were more of head of the household and more of a parent to me than my father because my father was busy, you know, just out hustling, you know, trying to do whatever he could do.  The greatest concern for my mother was the wellbeing of my brother, Ronnie [Ronnie Carson], and myself because we were--you know, Ronnie had to be ten, maybe eleven when she left and I was five or six.  My sister, Loretta [Loretta Carson Dowling], was more of a teenager, Louise [Louise Carson Ham] was a teenager, and they were older.  But, my sister, Ruth [Ruth Carson], wound up being more of my guardian than anyone else.  And, you know, I always knew where my mother was.  I could write letters to her.  But, you know, I look at what she did and the sacrifices that she--that she made and I know just in retrospect, it had to be very difficult for her to love her family as much as she did and then to have to leave them.  Ironically, I've connected with the families that she worked for, and those families have shared with me how much they loved her and what an influence she had on them as they were growing.  And there's one family who had--who, I met the daughters and they talked about how my--they'd come home and their mother and my mother would be sitting at the table having tea or having coffee, and my mother would be talking their mother through some kind of situation that their mother was going through, or the other family, I've become friends with the young man who my mother basically helped to raise into manhood.  And it's very interesting to--after so many years, you come in contact with these people who your mother touched when she was not touching you.  And so, you know, she's--she was loved by her family, but she was also loved by the people who employed her to clean their houses and so forth, but also she was very wise and she was a sounding board for those that she worked for.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's interesting.  We've heard quite a few stories about, you know, relationships across a racial and a so-called class divide with people that worked for, you know, white people that can afford, you know, to pay and that sort of thing.  So, it's--yeah, it's an interesting dynamic.  We often hear that kind of story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 519488
Speaker 1: Getting back to my father [Edgar Carson, Sr.], I have nothing but love and respect for my father.  He did things the way that he did things, and again, he didn't have the education.  My mother [Gladys Eaddy Carson] didn't have the education.  And so when you think about it, and I think how deprived they were to not be able to get the education that they should have gotten, and if they had gotten that education, would their lives have been different?  And so--
Speaker 2: Well, they came out of like a segregated school system in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Well, I went to a--
Speaker 2: --the South.
Speaker 1: --segregated school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, back then.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: It was before desegregation.
Speaker 2: And a couple generations out of slavery.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And where people were left landless, basically.  So, I'm just saying that South Carolina is not the most liberal state in the union.  It's a pretty rough (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.  If you're in South Carolina, it's been the way it is for a long time, yeah.  You know, I--at my age, I do more reflection now than I used to, and I think about my ancestors coming here against their will.  And when I think of--and I haven't really spent a whole lot of time in Charleston [South Carolina], but in that low country area of South Carolina, I can't help but believe that that's where the origin of my family started, in that Charleston area, you know, getting off the boat.  But, you know, there are so many other individuals who as, as well in that low country area of Charleston, I--and I just think of--I was in Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] last week and, and I was just thinking of, you know, when you go past, you know, different areas and you see plantations, Hilton Head Plantation [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], and, you know, you just sort of think back and imagine what it was like for my forefathers to live and work and survive in those areas.  And so, you know, I'm very thankful, I'm very grateful, but I'm also very respectful of what preceded me.  I can only imagine.  And in my life now, I try to help those who might need a helping hand, a word of encouragement, much like people in my life did for me.
Story_ID: 519489
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Gladys Eaddy Carson and Edgar Carson, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: I can just imagine.  I don't know any stories.  But I can just imagine that he worked on the railroad and sort of--him coming to town and they connected at some point, fell in love, and started to raise a family.
Speaker 1: So, you don't think there's any--I mean, for married people to decide to live apart, well, most of the time there's something going on that's not--there's some friction there 'cause I can't imagine that otherwise.
Speaker 2: You know, there might have been.  You know, I certainly was not privy to what was going on in their bedroom.  The only thing I know is, they separated not because they didn't get along, but she felt like she was doing what would be best for the family.  And she really agonized over, you know, telling the family, and I do remember when we had the conversation.  And she had the conversation with my siblings before she had the conversation with me.  And, you know, when my mother would leave to go to work, I would cry, and so for her to leave for an extended period of time, you know, I cried and--but, you have to get over it, you can't keep crying.  You have to move on.  And so, you know, she would write and my sisters would read the letters and, you know, as long as everything was okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I mean, I keep thinking they must have grown apart if she's there and he's in Florence [South Carolina].  But, but did they get back together when she came back?  Did they seem like they were--
Speaker 2: Well, they were cordial to one another and, like I say, I don't know what took place in, in their relationship.  I remember at one point going to Aiken, South Carolina.  Apparently my--somebody had some land, and they left the--they had several heirs to the land, and so the land was being sold, and my mother came home from New Jersey, and I got on a bus with her and went from Florence to Aiken, South Carolina.  We went to see an attorney, and I guess she went and she picked up a check.  And she came back home and my father took the check and he used the check for whatever he wanted.  And I remember the pain that that caused my mother to go through that effort to--he didn't go.  She went, she took care of everything, she brought the check back, and then he took the check and he spent it as he saw fit, and most of it was on alcohol and so forth.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I remember--I remember her tears and the pain that she felt, you know, that's one of those things that--like, I don't remember a lot of stuff, I remember that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember the pain that she felt as a result of his actions at that time--
Story_ID: 519490
Speaker 1: --And that's why I said, you know, I learned a lot from my father [Edgar Carson, Sr.].  I learned not to be like him.  I respected him because he was my father.  And I know that we're going to talk about football, but my father never went to one football practice.  He never went to one game.
Speaker 2: So, he wasn't involved in sports.
Speaker 1: He wasn't.  But yet, the men who he hung out with, they knew that I was playing at the local high school, but he never really put forth the effort to come and see me play.  And it never bothered me.  You know, I just sort of did my own thing and he lived his life, and, you know, he was my father.  And, you know, when he passed away in 1975, I remember--I was in college [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and I came home at the end of my junior year, and he had gone to the doctor, and I could see that his health was deteriorating, and I was home for about two weeks, and during the time that I was there, he went from being--you know, being able to walk to being bedridden.  And I remember giving him a bath and giving him a shave, and then I said, "I have to go," 'cause I was going to summer school, and I said, "I have to go," and he said, okay.  And I'm standing in the door and I'm looking at him and I knew I would never see him again alive.  And a few days later, my college coach [Willie Jeffries] called me into his office and he said, "Your father passed away last night," and so that was it.  And, like I said, the memories that I have of my father--I remember those days when, you know, my mother [Gladys Eaddy Carson] would make his meal and take the meal to the railroad station and give--you know, he'd have his meal and iced tea and whatever, but she loved him, but I don't know if they were in love with one another.  And so, you know, I just--
Speaker 2: So, his issues basically of drinking and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Drinking and--
Speaker 2: --got the best of him.
Speaker 1: --and that was really the culture back then.  There are a lot of men who he associated with.  They drank a lot, and I don't know if they drank a lot because they were so addicted to alcohol or they were drinking a lot to deal with the pain that they were feeling.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would think--I would think that's a lot of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But--you know, and once you start it, you're not gonna--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --stop.
Story_ID: 519491
Speaker 1: Was that your impression of the neighborhood?  'Cause I was gonna ask you about the sights, sounds, and smells of the community.  What did it look like, the area that you grew up in?  What was it called?  Did it have a name?
Speaker 2: Well, it was East Florence [Florence, South Carolina].  I lived on Johns Street right near Pine Street.  It was definitely--in the words of--I don't know who said it, but you'll probably--it takes a village to raise a child, and that was my village.  And the people who lived across the street from me, the people who lived next door, you know, everybody looked after me.  They looked after all the kids in the neighborhood.  And if you did something wrong, you're gonna get a spanking from them and then you're gonna go home and you're gonna get another spanking.  And everything was--that was the way it was.  And so my neighbors looked out for me.  And when I go to my hometown, I occasionally go back to that area and sort of reminisce of Joe Scott, and his wife, Miss Josephine [Josephine Scott], living next door, the Kennedys [ph.] who lived across the street on the corner, Allie Brooks [Allie E. Brooks, Jr.] and Mr. Brooks [Allie E. Brooks, Sr.], his father who lived across the street, you know, the kids who I went to school with who lived on the same street.  You know, many of those young people who I grew up with, many of them have passed away, and they passed away in their forties and fifties and, you know, I'm still around.  And, you know, it's just very interesting that, that the life that we've lived, and when I go back, that's what I sort of hang onto, my roots.  We had a grandaunt who lived with us, and she was my father's [Edgar Carson, Sr.] aunt, and we called--her name was Louise Wilburn, and she worked. she lived in the house with us, but she lived--I mean, she worked at McLeod Hospital [McLeod Regional Medical Center, Florence, South Carolina], and I remember meeting her every day when she'd get off the bus and she'd, you know, have an apple or a carton of chocolate milk.  And, you know, I just looked forward to that little carton of chocolate milk and her getting off the bus.  She took care of me as well.  And--but, you know, like I said, any time I go back to Florence when I have some time, I like to go back to that area.  It's no longer the way it was when I was growing up.  I have grandkids now, and I put my grandkids in the car and I take them to that area so that they could see where their pop pop grew up so that they would have some, some sense of history so that years from now when someone else is sitting across from my grandson or my granddaughter, they can do a much better job of talking about their pop pop and their ancestors than I've been able to.  Because, you know, quite frankly, I didn't really concern myself with it.  I was sort of into my own little world playing soldier, and so I wasn't about, you know, when they said, "Okay, we're going to visit Aunt Jessie Mae [Jessie Mae Timmons]," I'm hopping in the car and I wasn't asking any questions, I was just going to have fun.
Story_ID: 519492
Speaker 1: Now, you were six when your mother [Gladys Eaddy Carson] left.  You're ready to start the first grade, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you have kindergarten at all?  Was it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, had kindergarten and, you know, some of the kids who I went to kindergarten with were kids who, you know, I saw in church, kids who I eventually started first grade with, and--
Speaker 1: So, this is Holmes School [Holmes Elementary School, Florence, South Carolina], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Holmes School.
Speaker 1: Was it named after any particular person that you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it was named after someone [W.F. Holmes].  It's Holmes, H-O-L-M-E-S.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Holmes Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, it's an all-black school in South Carolina and--
Speaker 2: I remember when I was--right before I was walking out the door, my sister, Ruth [Ruth Carson], took me on my first day and my mother said, "Make sure you get--make sure they put him in Mrs. Washington's [Flora Washington] class."  And I didn't know what that meant at the time, but all of my siblings had Mrs. Washington.  And so she was a tough first grade teacher who drilled all of her students in penmanship.  And so if you met individuals who I went to school with, or who went to Holmes School, we all probably write the same way, and that's because of Mrs. Washington.  And so even today when I sign an autograph, people say, "Oh, you have such great penmanship," and I go, "My first grade teacher."
Speaker 1: That's interesting 'cause they, they--a lot of places, they don't teach cursive until the second or third grade.
Speaker 2: No, that was it for us.  They didn't teach printing.  I remember they used to have the little letters on a, like green paper--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--
Speaker 2: --around the room and, you know, you look and see how to make, you know, certain alphabets.  You had the capital, but then you also had the--you know, the small print, and, yeah, it was interesting.
Speaker 1: So, were you a big kid growing up?  Were you--
Speaker 2: No.  I--you know, I was big when I was born, but I wouldn't say I was big.  I think I went through a growth spurt between seventh and ninth grades, but I always feel like I'm just like anybody else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't really see myself as being huge.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought I'd ask that question 'cause sometimes we don't know what--people look like, they have the potential to play football or basketball when they're young or what, you know.  But--okay, so Holmes School, and did you like school growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really (laughter).  You know, I--when I went to school, we--I just wanted to have fun and sometimes I didn't know when to be serious and when to have fun.  And Mrs. Washington was a strict disciplinarian, and she'd leave the room and she'd say, "All right, I'm leaving the room, nobody, nobody talks."  And so somebody would say something or I would say something, and come back in the room, Mrs. Washington would catch us and not just one person got a whipping, everybody got a whipping.  We all got strapped in the hand.  And so, you know, when she said no talking, she meant no talking.  And so even the good kids, you know, got a swat in the hand.  And so, yeah, in a way, I think that sort of helped to develop me.  You know, if you are part of a group and somebody is going to misbehave or want to do things their own way, it's gonna make things difficult for the rest of the group.
Speaker 1: Now, you have a keen sense of order from what I read in the book ['Captain for Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson].  You like to do things at a certain time, and, you know, you like to structure things.  Did--is school responsible, or the family or a combination of both?
Speaker 2: I think it's more about school.  And when I say school--you know, I had teachers who really wanted me to succeed.  Mrs. Washington was one of those teachers and, you know, she would love you to death and, you know, and she'd make it known, "It's nothing personal, but I want you to succeed," because Mrs. Washington and teachers like Mrs. Washington, they had a sense as to what they were preparing us for and they wanted us to succeed.  And they painstakingly put all of their effort into educating us.
Story_ID: 519493
Speaker 1: That whole thing about structure, I think I got that later.  I was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  To be in ROTC and take part in drill, you have to have structure.  You have to learn what leadership is all about.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is in high school, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is high school.
Speaker 2: At Wilson [Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Wilson.  And then--Wilson and then McClenaghan High School [Florence, South Carolina].  And then, you know, once you start playing football, you know, you got to have a certain structure that's there.  You can't just go and do things, you know, your own way.  And so over a period of time, you know, I've sort of learned what structure is all about.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, there's a story in there that you had experienced kind of a growth spurt in grade school, I guess, and one of the bad guys in the school wanted to fight, right?  And--well, can you explain what happened?
Speaker 1: I was in junior high, and, you know, I had been transferred--you know, we went from Holmes School [Holmes Elementary School, Florence, South Carolina] where, you know, all the kids in East Florence [Florence, South Carolina] who went to Holmes School, the kids in North Florence [Florence, South Carolina] went to North Vista Elementary School [Florence, South Carolina].  Because of segregation, we went from Holmes School to Wilson Junior High School [Florence, South Carolina].  So, you had kids from East Florence, North Florence, West Florence [Florence, South Carolina], going to one junior high school.
Speaker 2: Now you had to pass by the white school to get to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --this--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You take the bus, and if you miss the bus, you had to walk.  And if you had to walk, it was like maybe three miles, but you'd have to walk to get to either the high school or the junior high school.  And so I don't know, I went to school, and I don't know what happened, but, you know, this guy came up to me and I don't know if I insulted him or whatever, he said, "I'm gonna kick your ass.  I'm gonna kick your ass at recess."  I'm like, well, what did I do?  What did I do?  And he's one of these guys, you look at him and you knew he was--he was a tough looking guy.  And, you know, I had never really been in a fight in school.  And so as the day progressed, everybody knew that, you know, this guy wanted to fight me, but I couldn't figure out why.  Why would he want to fight me?  And so as lunch time was approaching, you know, everybody started to gather, and, you know, I saw him.  He was looking for me.  And so, he came over and instead of standing there waiting for him to hit me or understanding that it--you know, back then, it wasn't just about fighting, you know, with the fist, you know, he could've had a razor, he could've had a knife or anything.  I mean, he could've, you know--you know, stabbed me.  And so I ran.  And, you know, everybody laughed.  And so when they laughed, you know, I could care less, but at least, you know, I was safe as opposed to fighting for something that I didn't even know what I was fighting for.  I wasn't gonna fight for the sake of fighting.  But I ran.
Speaker 2: Now you say I think later on that you think that the fellow was, was relieved that you ran (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I would hope so.
Speaker 2: --later on 'cause he didn't mess--really mess with you anymore, right?
Speaker 1: No.  I mean, we--and we eventually finished out the school year, we wound up going to the same high school together.  And we never really--we never really talked about it but, you know, I distinctly remember, you know, I need to get out of here because I didn't want to be on display.  I didn't want to put on a show for anybody, you know, just by going out fighting for something that I didn't even know anything about.  And so, you know, I just figured that, you know, fighting wasn't gonna solve anything, you know.  Let's talk about it.  What's going on?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that seems awful thoughtful for a middle school student (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Let's--
Speaker 2: --male in those--
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's talk this thing out.  I mean, what did I do to insult you that you'd want to fight me?
Speaker 2: Now, most males at that age are not that reflective anyway--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and for you to be, you know, in that situation, it's interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 519494
Speaker 1: You played in the band, too, right at one point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--
Speaker 1: When you started.
Speaker 2: I took band as an elective subject when I went from--actually, I was still in junior high [Wilson Junior High School, Florence, South Carolina] because high school started for me in the tenth grade, but I took band in ninth and then tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did you play?
Speaker 2: Saxophone.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, for someone who is gonna be known as the captain of the New York Giants (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--well, I--
Speaker 1: --I mean in--
Speaker 2: That had--
Speaker 1: --in the future.
Speaker 2: That, that wasn't even in my--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.
Speaker 2: That wasn't even in my--even--that was not even in my sights at that time because I was just a kid in school, I had to choose an elective subject, and I chose band.  Everybody else--you know, people--other people that I knew, they were taking band.  I took band and I took ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, you know, I was taking band, you know, just going and blowing the horn and everything, and then I went through this growth spurt, and I went out for the football team.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your brother [Ronnie Carson] play football?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He's four years older than you, right?
Speaker 2: No.  He was more of an artist.  He drew.  He didn't really play any instruments, but he was--he sang.  Later in life, he was part of a--part of a music group in the local area.  Nobody in the family really participated in any kind of sports except my older sister, Ruth [Ruth Carson], she played a little high school basketball.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what inspired you to play football?  What, what, what--
Speaker 2: Well, what inspired me is when I was in junior high school, I went to football game, and this might be in the book ['Captain For Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson], but I went to a football game and I was standing by the fence as the game ended and, you know, everybody was--started walking off the field and I could smell the sweat that football players expel, you know, when they've been rolling in the dirt and in the grass and all that stuff.  And as they were walking by me, I could smell it.  And they were dirty and they would stink and they were bloodied, and I went up by the field house where they were changing.  And so when I got up to the field house, I saw the girls waiting outside and I said to myself, "I want to be that--I mean, that's what I want."  I want to be a football player because, you know, the girls were attracted to the football players, and that, that was really the reason why I wanted to play football, just for the girls.  And so when I went through the growth spurt, I was in ninth grade, and I went to New Jersey, visited my mom [Gladys Eaddy Carson], came back, I said, "I'm going out for the football team."  I didn't prepare, I didn't run, I didn't do anything, and I just showed up, got the helmet, got the shoulder pads, and I'm walking from Wilson High School [Florence, South Carolina] to my home over in East Florence [Florence, South Carolina], which had to be like a two and a half mile walk.  And so I'm walking through town, I'm carrying the helmet, I'm carrying, you know, the shoulder pads, everybody see me with the stuff and it's like, oh, you're a football player, you know, blowing the horn and everything.  And I'm thinking, wow, you know, this is really cool.  You know, everybody recognizing me because of football and because they're seeing the helmet and, and the shoulder pads.  And so I show up the next day and it's like a shock to my system because I put on the uniform, helmet, shoes and everything, whistle blows, we run out, we're doing exercise, we're doing grass drills, we're running plays, and then we're like hitting one another.  My body gives out.  My body says, I don't wanna be here and I'm leaving.  And so I walked off the field and I quit the team.  And I just wasn't ready for it 'cause I had nev- I'm not prepared.  I'm--you know, I was--I was doing it for all the wrong reasons.  I was doing it because of girls.  I didn't--I wasn't serious about it.  I thought, well, if this guy can make it, you know, I can make it.  He's no better than me, and I just learned that in order to do something like that, you have to prepare, and I did not prepare.  And as they say, the monkey jumped on my back and I said, you know, "This is not where I need to be," and I walked off the field.
Story_ID: 519495
Speaker 1: When I walked off the field, I turned in my uniform, and I was walking home, I passed a field where I saw these guys, they were--I mean, they weren't like the high school team, they were just like a rag tag bunch of guys, you know.  It must've been maybe eighteen, twenty guys, and one of the men called me over and he said, "Hey, you know, you should be playing football," not knowing that I had just quit the high school team.  And so he said, "Come back tomorrow and I'll give you a uniform."  I said, "Okay."  I went back the next day, I got the uniform, and I eased my way into it gradually and so that's the--that's how I really got started playing football.
Speaker 2: Now, this is a Boys Club [Florence Boys Club of America; Boys and Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee Area, Florence, South Carolina] team, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And who is your coach?
Speaker 1: E.J. McIver, and the other guy's last name was Coach Sanders [Robert Sanders].  I forgot--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --what his first name is.
Speaker 2: And I think you all played six games.
Speaker 1: Yeah, like six or seven games.
Speaker 2: And people weren't in any greater shape than you, I guess.
Speaker 1: No.  You just sort of ease your way into it and, you know, it was more about having fun.  High school was more competitive, but this was about playing other teams in the area that, you know, they--I mean, they weren't even high school teams or anything like that, and we just went and we played and that was it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so, I had to go to school with all of these guys who I ran out on that field with, and so to see all of these guys who hung in there was painful for me because, you know, every Friday--you had a game on Friday night, well during school, they wore their jersey and I'm thinking to myself, you know, that could've been me, but I gave up.  And so it gnawed at me, and so I decided that I was going to give it another shot only to silence that voice that I was feeling, that I was hearing that I was a quitter.  And so I came back the next year, being better prepared, and I said to myself, "If that guy next to me is going to stick and stay, I'm gonna stick and stay," and no matter what, I'm gonna be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, how, how did you prepare yourself for the--you know--
Speaker 1: I ran quite a bit in the heat of July.  You know, in South Carolina, it gets real hot and so people have a tendency to stay in the house and use the fan 'cause, you know, at that point, there's no air conditioning, but they--using a fan and they're staying out of the heat and out of the sun, but I was out running, you know, vacant fields and doing sprints and so forth.  So, that was, you know, one of the ways where--in which I got prepared.
Story_ID: 519496
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is 1968, right?  You're at Wilson High School [Florence, South Carolina].  That's when you first tried out, right?  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen six--
Speaker 1: --so your sophomore year--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968], I think I was probably in the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So, that's--this is a little later than that then.
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: This is '70 [1970] or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wilson High School I think was 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's when you first tried out and then you made the team in '70 [1970], right?  The fall of '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: I went to South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it might be '68 [1968], '68 [1968]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Between '69 [1969] and '70 [1970], I guess--you're, you're like fifteen in '69 [1969] I think when it is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think--you know, so at any rate, you go back, you try out for the team, but this time you make the team, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was your--I mean, did you barely make it or did you really make it or how did--
Speaker 2: No, I think I made it because they had a nice class before I got there of older guys and so those guys had graduated and they had to replenish the team, and so I was a--not a freshman but a sophomore and I was able to make it, and I was playing defensive line.  And so, you know, we had a coach who ironically, you know, just going back to when I quit, he saw, he laughed at me when I was walking off the field, and he teased me, and he said, you know, "Here's another one I'm running away.  I'm running him away.  He ain't got no business here."  And so I always remember what he was saying and how he laughed at me.  And so that was one of the incentives to hang in there and fight through whatever adversity or whatever challenge that was going to be presented to me.  And so when I made it, then he sort of took me under his wing and he knew I was there, you know, to play and he knew I could help the team in some way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, who is this coach?  This is the coach at Wilson, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: High school.
Speaker 2: William Long.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We used to call him Scooby.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you said you played defensive line.  Was that the coach's choice or yours?
Speaker 2: No, that was the coach's choice.  I was a defensive end and I didn't know what it was.  I mean, it was just, you know, they put me in a position and I played it.
Story_ID: 519497
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I've read that one of your heroes is Willie Davis [HistoryMaker Willie D. Davis] of the Green Bay Packers who was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --popular then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --football player.  Was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you discover him after you were made a defensive end or before?
Speaker 2: I think before because I--you know, I watched the NFL [National Football League] football, and Kansas City [Kansas City Chiefs] and Green Bay in the Super Bowl back during that time.  Willie Davis is one of those guys who I admired, you know, the way that he played the game.  And so when I started playing defensive end, you know, I would sort of focus in on him and how he played the game, and I'd sort of take, take little elements of his game and try to apply it to what I was trying to do.  Not just Willie, Willie Davis, but also David "Deacon" Jones.  And so I tried to emulate them.  But, Willie Davis was the guy who I sort of liked more than anybody else, and also Buck Buchanan--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know.  And, ironically, all three of those individuals went to historically black institutions [HBCUs].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There was--now correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I made this point at another--or somebody else made it in another interview that the American Football League--though there were some NFL teams that used players from small black colleges, I think the Browns [Cleveland Browns] had a couple like Jim--I mean, Leroy Kelly from Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], but the AFL, the American Football League, really started utilizing a lot of the black players from small colleges.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think had it not been for the AFC [American Football Conference] or the AFL, a lot of those players probably would not have gotten the opportunity to show what they could do.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so Buck Buchanan at Kansas City, a mountain of a guy, who I thought he was quick, and, you know, he wore that number eighty-six and, you know, I'd see that number and I'd go, "I wanna be like him."  And then I'd see Willie Davis and--yeah, number eighty-seven for the Green Bay Packers, and I'd think, "I wanna be like him," and I'd see Deacon Jones and, you know, I wanted to be like him.  So, I--you know, all of their game, you know, I took a little bit out of--you know, with Deacon, it was the head slap thing that I used to do and, you know--
Speaker 1: You'd slap the offensive linemen in the head (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Because as a defensive lineman, you know, it's what I saw.  My coaches didn't teach me to do that, but for the most part, once a play develops, you know, you find a way to beat your--beat the guy in front of you.  I was pretty quick and so I used my quickness, but I also used the head slap to sort of, you know, get the guy's attention and get him sort of off balance and use my hands to get around him.  So, you know, that stuff I got from Deacon Jones and Willie Davis and, you know, Buck Buchanan.
Story_ID: 519498
Speaker 1: So, did you get a lot of quarterback sacks when you started?
Speaker 2: I got a few.  I wouldn't say a lot, but I got a few.  You know, what was key is not necessarily getting the sacks, but getting the pressure, to force the quarterback to hurry the throw.  But, I was also agile enough to start in one direction, and if they were to run a play, then I was able to get to the outside and run down the running back.  And if I--you know, first thought it was pass and then it's run.  So, I was fortunate in that I had that lateral, you know, speed to get to the sideline.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were you relatively fast, you know, on the team--I mean as such, would you say?
Speaker 2: You know, I was pretty basic.  You know, I knew what I had to do and I didn't have to think a whole lot.  And, you know, once you're on the field and you start getting a good feel for what you're doing, then, you know, you can utilize your quickness and your agility.  And, you know, a lot of the guys who I played against, especially in games, not so much in practice, but in games, they were bigger than me.  And so they were bigger but not necessarily more agile or quicker or anything like that.  So, I would run around them because I had that quickness.  You know, they might've been 220 pounds or 230 pounds, offensive linemen, but I was a down defensive lineman and I weighed maybe 180.  So, I had the quickness to, you know, beat them sometimes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  I know you mentioned a player--I can't remember everybody, but it's a guy named Bubble Gum that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Bubble Gum is the one who I had to go against in that first practice.  And so when I had to go one-on-one with him and he hit me, and he was a senior, I was a freshman, and so when we collided, that's when I got my first concussion.  Because I didn't get knocked out, but I saw stars.  And so that one hit always stays with me as my first, you know, ding, if you wanna call it that, or concussion, and that's part of the reason why I walked off the field, you know, didn't feel good.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, you're a freshman and I was a freshman who had not prepared, and so I was like fresh meat for these dogs who were hungry.  And so when he hit me, you know, I didn't know what to do.  I mean, he hit me and he just drove me back and, you know, pancaked me.  And I'm like, "No, I got to get out of here."  This is embarrassing but also it hurt.  And so, you know, that's the thing that really stands out in my mind at the first practice, thought.  That wasn't my second year.  I--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's one of the reasons why I quit.
Speaker 1: Now, your second year when you made the team, you were actually made a starter, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The second year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was, considering I had not had that much playing experience prior to that except with the Florence Boys Club [Florence Boys Club of America; Boys and Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee Area, Florence, South Carolina].  But, you know, with the--with the boys club, I was able to ease my way into playing the game and sort of understand what I had to do physically to prepare to play.  But then once I got physically prepared to play cond- from a condition standpoint, I was able to go out and play and have fun, and I did that at the Florence Boys Club.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I had a better sense of what I needed to do once I went back, you know, my tenth grade, my sophomore year at Wilson [Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina].  And so I just made that goal to myself.  If that guy is going to stay, I'm gonna stay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause nobody's gonna run me off.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your academics?  What about your school work?  Was that--were you good in school?
Speaker 2: I was fair.  I was--you know, I was not, I wouldn't say academically gifted.  I was probably an average student and I think I was average only because I allowed other things to take priority over school, and my focus was not on school, it was on either having fun or sports.
Story_ID: 519499
Speaker 1: In your junior year, you go to McClenaghan School [McClenaghan High School, Florence, South Carolina], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think that might've been like 1969 when the principal of Wilson [Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina] called me in and his name is Robert Durant [Robert A. Durant], and he said if--you know, I knew I was--you know, desegregation was taking place and, you know, the kids who I rode the bus over to school with, they were going to be going to a school closer to us, and he said, "I will keep--I can keep your records if you want," and I said, "No, I'm just gonna go ahead and go with the rest of my, you know, people from East Florence [Florence, South Carolina]."
Speaker 1: Now, he was trying to keep you there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right?  And so--but what made you want--
Speaker 2: For the football program.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But--well, okay.  But, did you see like going to a new school as an adventure or an opportunity or what--how did you--
Speaker 2: No.  I wanted to be with the people who I grew up with because, you know, most of those people who I--who would be going to the new school, were people I went to Holmes School [Holmes Elementary School, Florence, South Carolina] with, and they were going on to junior high, and so there was that connection with, you know, those kids.  And so we all went to the new school--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, 'cause McClenaghan is in your old neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --even though you couldn't go to school there before.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But it was in the same neighborhood.
Speaker 2: McClenaghan from where I lived at that time was probably four blocks away from where I lived.  And so, you know, there were people who were--you know, other students were asking me, "Are you gonna go to McClenaghan or are you gonna go back to Wilson?"  And I said, "Well, I don't know."  And, and I was debating it for a while and then I just decided I was gonna go to McClenaghan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, you had a Coach Cubbage [Ladson Cubbage] at McClenaghan.  And, you said there were about eight other black students on the team?
Speaker 2: There were probably eight to ten black players on the team.
Speaker 1: This is out of like, what, forty, fifty?
Speaker 2: Probably out of like--yeah, about forty-five, fifty, yeah.  The rest of them were, you know--the rest of them were white.  We had no black coaches.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that was part of the problem that we had because, you know, when you pull up stakes and you go from doing things a certain way at Wilson--we'd have the pep rallies and you'd have the cheerleaders and you'd have the band and, you know, and it was all about our culture and what had been done at Wilson for generations, and then you're going to a different school and things at this new school are more understated and more conservative, and so it was interesting.  And it--you know, there was an adjustment.
Story_ID: 519500
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you this before, but this is a good time to ask about it.  What was your impression of race relations in Florence [South Carolina] in those days, and what was your impression of race relations in general?  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had already been assassinated, the Civil Rights Movement, which may or not--may or may not been televised in Florence.  You know, I don't know.  I know sometimes they kept it out of the news.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, from what your people were telling you and what you could see in your hometown, what were race relations like?
Speaker 2: I got a good sense of what race relations were like in my hometown just by living.  You know, I'd see the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].  You know, they'd come around in pickup trucks with a Confederate flag flying behind it.  There were times (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Through your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, not in our neighborhood, but if you walked to a certain area, like you come out of a neighborhood, you'll see--where I first lived, there was a block, another block, and then the next block, that's where white people started, you know.  And so I lived about two or three blocks away from, you know, white folks.  And so if you walk out of your little area, walk up the street, you know, you can see, you know, white folks in their homes, and you can see the Confederate flags.  You know, occasionally, you would hear, you know, somebody in a car and they'd go, "Hey, nigger, get, go back where you come from," or whatever and, and that was me as a kid, you know, and I heard it.  And so, you know, it's one of those things that you sort of live with it because what is the alternative?  You go to a restaurant, and when you go to the restaurant, you can't go in the restaurant.  You can go to the takeout window, but you don't go in the restaurant.  When you go to the doctor's office, you don't go in the front door, you go in through the back door.  When you go to the movie theater, you don't sit downstairs, you sit upstairs.  And so, you know, I experienced that as a youth, but that was the way it was.  You know, you go into a Belk's department store, and there's a white fountain and there's a black fountain.  You don't drink out of the white fountain.  And so it was the way that we lived.
Speaker 1: Now, this for a lot of black folks raised in the North, where there's also racism, would consider this a little different 'cause it's more in your face racism--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --than you'd find in New York [New York], you know, though it does exist here--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but it doesn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, this is something you had to take for granted 'cause that's where you were.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, it was the way that it was.  You know, there were parades where you could see the Klan marching in the parade.  For me, at my age, you know, what am I supposed to do, you know?  And in retrospect, I can just imagine what those previous generations had to go through.  And--but for me, it was life.  I mean, that was the way it was.
Story_ID: 519501
Speaker 1: Here you are, coming out of that situation, all of a sudden in a desegregated school.  How desegregated was it?  I mean--
Speaker 2: It was probably 30 percent, maybe 25 percent black, 75 or 80, or 70 percent white.
Speaker 1: What about the faculty?
Speaker 2: The faculty was obviously majority white.  You may have had--I remember there was an assistant principal, he was black.  There were at least two teachers who were black, but there were no black coaches.  And so I think what saved me in that situation, what was a tremendous asset for me was ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  I took ROTC at Wilson [Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina], and then I transferred to McClenaghan [McClenaghan High School, Florence, South Carolina] and I took ROTC there.  And I remember it was Air Force ROTC, and I remember when I first started with ROTC, I was an airman.  I had one little stripe.  And I worked my way up from being an airman to a sergeant to a second lieutenant to a lieutenant colonel.  And my senior year, I wound up being the flight commander.  And so I was heading the ROTC unit at McClenaghan High School, and I was sort of the top dog, and I had all of these white guys and girls in ROTC, and I was commanding over them.  And so that's where leadership comes in because you have to be equal or even with everyone, whether it's on the football field, or whether it's in the classroom with ROTC, you have to be even with everyone.  And, you know, that taught me many valuable lessons of leadership, that I was able to sort of work on in high school and then onto South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and then with the football Giants [New York Giants].  ROTC played a major role in that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, meanwhile, you're getting good reviews as a football player.  You're playing defensive end still, and you're getting write-ups in the paper and people are, are starting to talk about you as a football player.  So, football--once you started playing, from what I was reading--
Speaker 2: I got better and better.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It seems like it's just a natural thing for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, like I said, I didn't have any black coaches, but I had--the players who I played with, especially the black players, they leaned on me for support.  They looked at me as being their leader.  And so, I wasn't just playing, but I had to be somebody who was going to look out for them and advocate for them.  We had situations at the new school where we were not enthusiastically welcomed by some students, but then on the flipside, there were situations where the black kids did not want the white kids sitting with them.  We'd have pep rallies and we'd have--the gym was like in a section of four, like one bleacher, one--a second bleacher, and then across the way another bleacher and another bleacher, and all the black kids conjugated [sic.] in one bleacher, and they did not want the white kids coming to the bleacher.  And so when I saw what was happening, I had to step in and say, "That's wrong."  You know, we're in school and, you know, everybody is gonna be rooting for the same team and, you know, we can't have this dissension.  And so, you know, I had to at least show the leadership to chastise those who loved me, those who supported me.  And, you know, there were like one or two people who called me a sellout because, you know, I chastised them for doing something that was counterproductive to, you know, bringing everybody together.  And so that bothered me.
Story_ID: 519502
Speaker 1: Eventually, everything sort of came together, and as more time went by, we became more accepting of one another.  And, you know, I wound up having friends who I played with, and we still are in touch with one another, especially like in this era of Facebook.  You know, we sort of keep track of one another.  And, you know, when I went to the--went into the Pro Football Hall of Fame [Canton, Ohio], you know, some of those guys who I played ball with at Wilson [Wilson High School, Florence, South Carolina] or McClenaghan [McClenaghan High School, Florence, South Carolina], you know, got an invitation to come and witness my induction.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was one big white fellow who was an offensive tackle.  I can't remember his name right now, but you remember.
Speaker 1: Boyd Correll.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We call him B.C., B.C. Correll, yeah.  You know what was interesting is, prior to coming to McClenaghan, I had never played against a white guy or even with a white guy, so it was a different landscape, and you didn't know what that guy that you're going to go against, you don't know what he was going to bring you in terms of competition.  How hard is he going to hit you?  Or are you going to hit him harder?  So, we went through a period where we were sort of testing each other out, and we wound up coming together and playing together as a pretty good group.  And what was interesting is when it was good, it was good, you know, and it was--you'd see the difference in lifestyles when the weekend would come and the guys, the white guys would go to Myrtle Beach [South Carolina].  They'd get like a case of beer and they'd go to Myrtle Beach, and the black guys, they sort of stayed at home.  They'd watch--we'd watch Oklahoma [University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma] and Nebraska [University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska], you know, at somebody's house 'cause we didn't have the means to go and do things like the white guys.  And so that did bring us together as a group of black players, you know, playing together.
Story_ID: 519503
Speaker 1: Fast forward, my senior year [at McClenaghan High School, Florence, South Carolina], we played a game, and everybody going out, working, you know, busting their rear end, and so we played a game at Hillcrest High School [Hillcrest Middle School, Dalzell, South Carolina], which is near Sumter, South Carolina, and so we played the game, and the game ended with like a 7-7 tied score.  And so when we got on the bus, all the black guys went to the back of the bus, and so all the white guys were in the front of the bus, but that was by choice.  It wasn't that nobody--you know, anyone put us there.  It was what we wanted to do.  And so when we got on the bus, we sort of looked at like this.  We didn't lose the game.  We didn't win it, but we didn't lose it.  And so we got on the bus and some of the guys were sort of joking around.  And so one of the guys up front, he yelled to the back, he said, "Why don't y'all shut up back there?"  'Cause he was taking that tie kind of hard, you know.  And the black guys went, who is he talking to?  And just like that, there was dissension between the two groups.  And so the following Monday, nobody--the black guys decided that they were going to boycott because the coach didn't say anything.
Speaker 2: Well, I thought the coach chipped in on the side of the white players?  Did--was that not true?
Speaker 1: Well, the coach said, you know, "Everybody shut up."  And so it--you know, we sort of looked at each other and they decided that they weren't gonna go to practice on Monday.  So, everybody sort of showed up at my place, not that I told them to come, everybody showed up at my place and everybody--you know, we were talking about it and all the black guys were not--none of the black guys were at the practice.  And so one of the fathers of one of the white players knew where I lived and he kind of put two and two together and he came by, and he saw that all the players were at my place.  And so I think at that point, Ladson Cubbage probably had it out for me as a leader.  And--
Speaker 2: What was your relationship like before?  Did you have a good relationship with him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was okay.
Speaker 2: --as a coach?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was okay.  You know, I--like I say, I wished that we had had a black coach because we didn't have like that person that we could go to, to talk to about different things, that they would, you know, have an understanding of what we were feeling or experiencing.  We didn't have coaches that we could go to in that manner.
Story_ID: 519504
Speaker 1: So in the midst of this controversy on the football team [at McClenaghan High School, Florence, South Carolina], your academics are improving, right?  'Cause you've got a girlfriend named Donna Rae--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hawkins [Donna Rae Hawkins].
Speaker 1: --Hawkins who is--she's like really--
Speaker 2: A brainiac.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Smart, efficient.  She didn't wait--like if we were doing book reports, she would not wait until the last minute like I would.  And, you know, people ask me, who's your hero?  I have to say Donna Rae because had it not been for her--and her family sort of taught her the right way to not wait until the last minute to do your best in school, to apply yourself.  You know, I didn't have my mother [Gladys Eaddy Carson] in my life.  My family didn't really know what was going on with me.  I mean, they'd see the report cards, but they didn't really know exactly what was going on.  And so I was able to hide some things and that, that--you know, I probably could have been better if I'd really applied myself, but I was just sort of drifting.  And so when I--I'd known Donna Rae for years, I mean, coming from the same neighborhood.  Her father was a fireman, mother was a teacher.  You know, they had--she had both parents in house, intact, and I secretly admired that.  But, you know, we'd go to the library together, and I'd go just to sort of be with her.  And then I started opening books, and when I started opening books, it sort of gave me a clearer view of what I needed to do to better myself.  And so had it not been for her and her influence that she didn't even know--you know, and I was sort of craving to be like her, you know, I don't know where I would be.  So, she was really an influence.  And so we--one day, you know, we went to the, the fair together and, you know, there's a fair that sort of comes around like every year, and they're there for like four or five days, and I asked her to go to the fair with me, and so she agreed to do so.  And so, something happened where I just sort of looked at her in a different way, and we fell in love.  So--she was short in stature and I was tall, and we were like a Mutt and Jeff.  But, we complimented one another and, you know, she was a smart woman, young lady, and I think it helped me tremendously to get through that high school period.
Story_ID: 519505
Speaker 1: The football, this football crisis, now back to that, now with Coach Cubbage [Ladson Cubbage], this tension leads to you quitting the football team, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  We go back to practice as a group, and the next week, I sprain an ankle in the game, and I come out, I get taped up, I go back in, and then I sprain the other ankle.  And so I come out, I, you know, get taped up, but I don't go back in.  And so the next morning, which is a Saturday morning, I'm sort of walking through my house and, and holding onto the wall because I got two sprained ankles.  So, I go back to football practice and, you know, first day, no contact, don't--you know, just treatment.  Second day, no contact.  Then, the third day, I'm well enough to get back on the field.  And so toward the end of practice, we were running sprints, and I'm just sort of hobbling along and I hear, "Hey, Carson [HistoryMaker Harry Carson], if you can't run any faster than that, get off the field."  And so I don't know, with me, it's like you hit a nerve and I'm going to react.  And so I walked off the field.  And so when I walked off the field, I didn't--you know, it was out of anger as to what I heard.  And it wasn't so much what I heard, it was the tone of hearing it.  If you can't run any faster than that, get off the field.  And so I got off the field.  I walked in, you know, took my uniform off, and then I left.  And as I was leaving, everybody was still practicing and the black guys were calling me, "Harry, don't leave, don't leave," but, you know, my mindset was, I'm out of here.  And that's the thing.  I--you know, I've always had this side that if you challenge it, then I'm going to act out.  And when I was challenged by Coach Cubbage, I acted out, not fully understanding the ramifications.  Because by me leaving at that time, I think we had two or three games left, and I probably could have been selected to play in the North-South Shrine Bowl [Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas], which is a honor for any player to be selected to play for South Carolina against North Carolina.  And then, you know, I had been getting letters from different colleges in regards to, you know, schools trying to recruit me.  And so I didn't fully understand the ramifications of my actions as I was walking away.  I was only, you know, looking at the fact that I was a little pissed at what I just went through and I was gonna do things my way.
Speaker 1: So, I take it, this is in the fall of the year, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And later that year, you're elected class president, right?  Was that true?
Speaker 2: No, earlier.
Speaker 1: Earlier than that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I was senior class president at that point--at that point, but I was responding as a football player.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, being senior class president didn't even come into play.  It was that--you know, that football player with that mentality to, you know, I'll show you.
Speaker 1: So, now, this is interesting in you were the first black senior class president at this school [McClenaghan High School, Florence, South Carolina] undoubtedly, and with a 70/30 ratio, they must've really thought a lot of you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I would guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I got along with everyone.  You know, you go from running from a fight at junior high school [Wilson Junior High School, Florence, South Carolina] against a guy who--you know, you don't--why, to as a senior, you know, I worked to bring groups together, blacks and whites through football and, you know, if I had been just another student, I don't know how successful I might have been, but because I was a football player and I was a pretty good football player--you know, we had that cohesive sort of spirit among those who were just students, teachers.  We all sort of gravitated around one another when it came to, you know, playing the game of football.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, it just popped into my mind to ask about this, but what about the prom?  Did you go to the prom?  Did, did they have a separate black prom or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was--
Speaker 1: --was that--everybody was in the prom together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody went--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to the same prom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I took Donna Rae [Donna Rae Hawkins] and we had fun.  Graduation came and thank God I did enough to graduate.  I was senior class president, so I spoke at the commencement ceremony.
Story_ID: 519506
Speaker 1: And then, you know, everybody was going to different schools, or guys were going into the [U.S.] military or they were going to--going to work or whatever.  I didn't have anywhere to go because I quit the team.  And so--
Speaker 2: You were counting on a scholarship, football scholarship?
Speaker 1: You know, quite frankly, I wasn't even thinking about scholarships or anything like that.  You know, I was more focused on the fact that I had this ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] connection and I was thinking more about the military, and I'd always had this desire to be a pilot.  And so I didn't have a scholarship or anything and my family could not afford to pay for me to go to college, so I think I probably would have eventually gone into the military.  But I had two advocates.  One was a Mr. Madison [James Madison], who was our assistant principal and I mentioned he was one of the black administrators there at McClenaghan High School [Florence, South Carolina].  And he took me to North Carolina A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] where he went to school, and took some film, watched film, and they gave me a scholarship.  And so I thought, okay, I'm going to North Carolina A&T.  A week later, I get a letter from Hornsby Howell, the coach at North Carolina A&T, saying that they no longer had any money.  And so I was on the outs again.  And then Mrs. McDuffie [Dorothy Joe McDuffie], who was a teacher at McClenaghan, packed me up in her car and took me to Orangeburg, South Carolina, and I met at that time with Oree Banks and James Carson, who was the defensive coordinator, and watched film, and he gave me a full scholarship.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina]?
Speaker 1: South Carolina State, yeah.
Speaker 2: Orangeburg, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Orangeburg.  And so, I wound up going to South Carolina State and I--like I say, they recruited me, or I recruited them because I didn't have a scholarship.  And it was really my only option, but I accepted it knowing that I was going to be going to school with many of the guy- many of the students who I went to school with.  You know, they were going to South Carolina State, including Donna Rae [Donna Rae Hawkins].  And so that was the bright spot, that I was going to be going to a school with other kids who I knew I wouldn't have to, you know, like familiarize myself with knowing, you know, different people from different parts of the country and so forth.  So, I think had I not been so strong-willed and bone-headed, I probably could have gone to bigger schools.  But because I did not have a school that, you know, that I didn't finish, you know, playing football with, schools like the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee] and other schools like that, the bigger schools that were sort of--had me on their radar, they stopped looking because of what I did.  And so I wound up going to South Carolina State, which probably was the best decision that I could've made.
Speaker 2: Okay.  South Carolina State is in Orangeburg.  What was the--what were the school colors there?
Speaker 1: Garnet and blue.
Speaker 2: All right.  And the nickname?  The--
Speaker 1: Bulldogs.
Speaker 2: Bulldogs.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  And they played other black schools in a conference?  What was it?
Speaker 1: The Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you would play North Carolina A&T and--
Speaker 1: I'd play against North Carolina A and T, North Carolina Central [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], Maryland Eastern Shore [University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, Maryland], Delaware State [Delaware State College; Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware], Howard University [Washington, D.C.], you know, schools like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What was interesting--what was interesting, is when I went to North Carolina A&T, I met Willie Jeffries, who was an assistant coach at North Carolina A&T.  Hornsby Howell was the head coach.  And so I had the opportunity to speak with Willie Jeffries.  And so when they rescinded their scholarship, I went on to South Carolina State.  Oree Banks was the head coach, and that season, we won one game by one point.  They fired Coach Banks, and they recruited Willie Jeffries, who was an alumnus of South Carolina State, to come in and be the head coach.  And so we were sort of reunited as a result of him coming to South Carolina State.  So, you know, I was already there, and we developed a very, very close relationship.
Story_ID: 519507
Speaker 1: One thing you do in the book ['Captain for Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson], and you do it quite well, is to describe the first day of football practice in every location that you--every venue.  The smell of the grass when you get there and the heat.
Speaker 2: That was--actually, that was supposed to have been the title of the book, 'The Smell of Freshly Cut Grass,' because that's the one unique experience, especially back then, that everybody could relate to.  Every football player could relate to the smell of freshly cut grass.  Because I sort of waited so long to write the book, it ceased to be the norm because there are a lot of players who sort of graduated to artificial turf and they don't know what the smell of freshly cut grass is all about.  And so when you mentioned that, you know, I--it sort of made me go there.  I think that all football, if you're gonna play it, should be played on grass and not on artificial surfaces.  The risk of being injured is lessened when you're playing on grass, but also that smell is uniquely football.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you--so you were in a situation here [at South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], from what I understand, where he was doing two-a-day practices.  This was the most intense football practice that you've ever been a part of, but you were ready--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.  But in--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --like sweltering heat.
Speaker 2: You know, my first year, I could see that the players were not in the condition that they probably should have been in.  They were not as disciplined, and I think that's the reason why we went 1-10, or only won one game by, you know, that one point.
Speaker 1: Is this your freshman year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so when Coach Jeffries [Willie Jeffries] came in, he had a meeting with us and he told us how it was going to be and he was going to work us, and he was going to work us hard.  And the rest of the coaches that he had on his staff were committed to helping us get better.  We didn't necessarily have the equipment like at the bigger schools.  We didn't have the training room and all of that, but we ran a lot.  And what we did, it got us in condition to play.  And we didn't shy away from practicing in the heat of the day.  We ran a lot, and you had to run like under a certain time, and that was the job of Coach Goodwin [Samuel Goodwin].  He was the strength and conditioning coach, and he took great pride in whipping us into shape.  And so when we took the field, you know, playing against any opponent, especially in early September, we were ready to play.  So, we all owed that to Samuel Goodwin because we were always, you know, in tip-top condition.  I mean, we played games where at the end of the game, we could go and play another game because we were in that great of condition, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 519508
Speaker 1: Now, some of your teammates made the NFL [National Football League] too.  Donnie Shell was a little bit ahead of you, but he ended up playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was in all those--on all those championship teams.  Barney Chavous as well, right?
Speaker 2: When I--when I arrived at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] with Miss McDuffie [Dorothy Joe McDuffie], the first two people who I met going into the field house was Barney Chavous and Donnie Shell.  And Barney was a defensive lineman like I was, except he was big.  I mean, I was a guy who was probably 215 at the time, 215 pounds.  Barney was probably 250, 260, so, you know, he was a bigger guy, but he was very good at what he was doing and, you know, a lot of scouts were coming to watch him play.  And, you know, just being around those guys, I could see their commitment.  I could see their camaraderie, and it was good to be a part of that group.  Both of them, you know, wound up being mentors for me in terms of playing the game.  They are great players who left a legacy of good, strong defense, you know, at South Carolina State.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, there was a--during your sophomore year, you met a fellow named Thomas Holliday that you write about.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about him.
Speaker 2: Thomas Holliday was a--kind of a lanky offensive lineman who was on scholarship, smart guy, but he was not one of those guys who was going to be getting into the game a whole lot.  He was more cerebral, not so much--you know, you look at him, he didn't have the muscles and all of that stuff, but he was a smart guy.  And so I had to go against him in practice on one-on-one drills, and so me being a macho sort of guy, I'm like, what is this guy gonna do, you know.  I'm here, I'm pretty good at what I do, and what is he gonna do?  And so when we squared off against one another, then I found out that he exploded into me--when the ball snapped, he exploded into me and he hit me right up under my chin, and he kept his feet going and he just would not give up.  And so, you know, he was tenacious, and that's one of the things that we sort of talk about in practice, bulldog tenacity, that he was gonna, you know, stay after me.  And he took it upon himself to work on me.  And he--I don't know if he ever got into a game, but he took great pride in going against me in practice, and I think his feelings were that he was going to prepare me to, you know, play every week.  And quite frankly, he gave me probably more problems on the football field than the lineman I had to line up against.  And so, you know, he wasn't big or bulky, he had an explosion coming off the ball.  Most of the guys who I played with or played against were bigger guys, and I was able to use my speed and quickness and agility to get around and get to the quarterback and sack the quarterback.  But, he was one of those guys that one-on-one, if we had to go against one another, he was gonna fight me, tooth and nail (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Internal--
Speaker 2: And he was not--
Speaker 1: Internal--
Speaker 2: He was not gonna give up.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Internal strength, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 519509
Speaker 1: This team, this South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] team, I think it's your senior year, you held opponents to twenty-nine points total (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was my junior year.
Speaker 1: That's your junior year?
Speaker 2: Junior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, twenty-nine points.
Speaker 1: That's, that's unbelievable.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it's still an NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] record.  There were teams that we played, and when they showed up, let's say they're playing us at home, they left with less yards than what they came with (laughter) because we were just that efficient as a defense.  I mean, we were in such great shape, we had guys who would fight to get to the ball carrier.  I mean, they were really tenacious, and we all played together as a group, and we took great pride in what we did.  And we hit a lot of people, sacked a lot of quarterbacks, we threw a lot of running backs for negative yardage and, you know, we gave up twenty-nine points for the whole football season.
Speaker 1: So, by your senior year, where do you stand do you think?
Speaker 2: Senior year, it wasn't quite as good as the junior year of giving up, you know, just twenty-nine points, but we were still pretty good.  And they had asked me to play a different position my senior year.  They asked me to play nose tackle because the nose tackle that we had, I guess he got hurt or whatever, but they needed somebody to control the center.
Speaker 1: Now, this is really something in a small--I mean, they--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --they started playing a 3-4 [3-4 defense], I guess is what they call it, a 3-4.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were playing a--
Speaker 1: With--
Speaker 2: They were playing a 3-4 or a split four or something like that or an offset--I don't know.  It was some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Usually a nose--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --guard in that situation is a guy like Curley Culp or someone--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a wide-bodied, big guy--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that can--
Speaker 2: But, at that time, I was probably 225, maybe 227 [pounds] at the max.  And so there were some games where I would play nose tackle, and I would have to read the center to find out where the ball was going.  I didn't necessarily like it because I liked coming off the edge and using my speed and quickness as opposed to having to, you know, stalemate the center and then ward off the guard, maybe take on two blocks, the center and the guard, you know, and fight to get to the ball carrier.  And so I didn't necessarily like it, but I think I learned a lot from that experience, and they needed me at that position.  And so there were other guys who could play defensive end that couldn't play nose tackle, and so they asked me to play nose tackle, and so I--reluctantly I agreed to do so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this must mean that you were one of the strongest men on the team to--
Speaker 2: I was strong.  I wouldn't say I was the strongest.  I mean, there were guys who--you know, my roommate at the time, he was really, really strong.  I mean, these guys pumped a lot of iron.  And--but, for me, it was--purely I was--it was about speed and quickness.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a very--I had like a burst of strength initially.  I could explode into someone with speed and quickness, and with that initial burst of strength, and get people off of me, but if I had to like hold somebody, you know, for two seconds, especially an offensive lineman that might be 280, you know, I might lose that battle.  So--
Speaker 1: It's about moving.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 519510
Speaker 1: You stepped up your academic game, right?
Speaker 2: Well, because when I went to South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina]--I'm a little embarrassed to say this, but when I went to South Carolina State, I was just nuts, you know, because, you know, I went there with a girlfriend [Donna Rae Hawkins] and then we broke up once we got there, and then I started dating other girls.  And what was interesting was when the freshmen girls would arrive on campus, you know, their parents would unload them and take them up to their dorm and everything and so once the parents left, then all of the upper class guys sort of like vultures, you know, waiting for the parents to leave and then they'd swoop down on these freshmen girls.  And so for me, I'm like, wait a minute, there's a void that's not being addressed here.  What about the upper class girls?  I mean, there's already a--probably three or five to one ratio, you know, females and males.  And then I started dating like the older girls that the upperclassmen wouldn't deal with anymore.  And, and so I sort of lost my way and at the end of my freshman semester, I finished with a 1.31 grade point average, and 1.3 was academic probation.  And so that scared me to death, and so I knew that if I'd lost my scholarship, I would not have been able to continue.  And so I--you know, I had to get myself back on the right track.  And so I started, you know, studying more, doing my work and not focusing on, you know, women, and so I was able to, you know, raise that bar significantly.
Speaker 1: And you were able to graduate on time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, one of the--one of my proudest accomplishments was that I graduated with my class, and so I was not under any kind of duress or pressure to--you know, when I was drafted, to make the team or anything like that.  I'd gone through all of the steps that I needed to in terms of being certified.  I graduated with my class.  I was certified to teach if that's what I wanted to do or I could've gone into the [U.S.] military.
Story_ID: 519511
Speaker 1: The NFL [National Football League] draft, 1976, you're twenty-two years old, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, now, this is a kind of a difficult period.  Your father [Edgar Carson, Sr.] had passed away in '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: We already talked about that.  So, you're on the verge of entering into the NFL draft and you know you're a prospect, you know, right?  You're not sure you're gonna be drafted, but you suspect you will be, right?
Speaker 2: I heard rumblings that I probably would be--
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: --by somebody.
Speaker 1: Did scouts come down and talk to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I mean, scouts came by and, you know, they tested me.  You know, the scouts had been looking at me since my freshman year [at South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] because Barney Chavous was there, and they saw Barney, but they also saw this freshman on the other side of the line.  Barney was on the left side, I was on the right side.  And I remember meeting Bobby Beathard, who was the GM [general manager] of the Washington Redskins.  And I remember having a conversation with him, he said, "You keep doing what you're doing, I'll be back to see you when you're a senior."  And so I always remember that and that, that was not like an incentive or anything, I just thought, you know, at some point, you know, people are sort of making a fuss over me and playing and so forth.  I was more concerned about getting my degree.  And when I spoke to the scouts, some scouts saw me as an offensive lineman if I put on some weight, or they saw me as an outside linebacker.  I sort of looked at myself as a defensive end because that was my favorite position, that's the position that I was most effective in coming off the edge and rushing the quarterback.  So, that's where we are.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, a scout looking for defensive players has probably got to look a lot harder than somebody on offense.  I mean in a--'cause of the skilled positions on offense.  You can always hear this guy rushed for so many yards, this guy passed for this many yards, he can run this fast and that sort of thing.  But, defense takes a little bit more scrutiny I would think, but I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Well, well, I think with defense, you're looking at the intangibles.  And I think what the intangibles are, you're looking at speed, you're looking at agility, quickness.  You're looking at toughness, a lot of the things that you can't really measure.
Speaker 1: These are the days before they had the draft combines, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, they're eyeballing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the speed.  They're eyeballing your strength--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And--
Speaker 1: --instead of testing it.
Speaker 2: You know, one of the--one of--you know, I saw a lot of scouts come, and I remember Emlen Tunnell--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was one of the scouts who came to visit me and Emlen Tunnell was a hall of fame player.  I didn't know who he was, but I--
Speaker 1: He was a old time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --New York football Giant [New York Giants].
Speaker 2: But he was a--he was a Giants great.  And he came to see me and we had a brief conversation.  Obviously, they can't get too into--I mean, he is asking me questions and so forth.  So, he leaves, I speak with other scouts, and then there's a Rosey Grier who--not Rosey Grier, Rosey Brown--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who also was with the Giants, scout, and you know, we're talking about different stuff and lo and behold, I'm drafted to play with the Giants.
Story_ID: 519512
Speaker 1: You didn't find out until eleven o'clock that night that--I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well at--
Speaker 1: --'SportsCenter' didn't have a special--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on television and there was no--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there--
Speaker 1: --'SportsCenter.'
Speaker 2: --was no 'SportsCenter' back then.
Speaker 1: And, you know, where they, they televise the whole thing, all the draftees show up in a big auditorium now, and they wait to see if they--what kind of hat--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --they're gonna put on.  Now, none of this is going on, right?
Speaker 2: None of this is going on and, you know, I didn't go to class that day [at South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] 'cause I was waiting on a phone call.  And so during the course of the day, you know, it's just sort of dragging by, I'm listening to music, and so I just decided, no, I'm gonna get out the house.  I'm--not house, but get out of my room, and I just went out and I was hanging out with friends.  And then that night, I got--I was watching the news, and it was Channel 10 [WIS-TV] in Columbia, South Carolina, and they said, "In the NFL [National Football League] draft, there are two players from South Carolina selected.  Bennie Cunningham was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers and [HistoryMaker] Harry Carson was selected by the New York football Giants [New York Giants]." And that's when I found out that I was going to be playing with the Giants.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you, you were drafted in the fourth round, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I was drafted in the fourth round, but I was the 104th or 105th player chosen in the draft.  The Giants had the first round pick, they did not have a second nor third, but they had two fourth round picks--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and they were back-to-back picks.  And so Gordon Bell was the player who was selected before me, and Gordon was a running back out of the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and then I was selected.  Now, the story behind my selection is this.  Bill Arnsparger was the head coach, and he gave that second pick in the fourth round to Marty Schottenheimer.  Marty had the choice of any defensive player he wanted to choose.  And so they made Marty get up in the draft meeting to declare who he wanted to select.  Out of all the players in the country, Marty selected me.  I think they were going between me and Carl Hairston from the University of Maryland Eastern Shore [Princess Anne, Maryland].  But Marty chose me.
Story_ID: 519513
Speaker 1: When I was selected [by the New York Giants in the 1976 National Football League draft], you know, a few days later I had to fly to New York [New York] and go, physical, and go through a little rookie minicamp.  And so after we went through the first day of meetings and everything, Marty [Marty Schottenheimer] came to me and he said, "You know, Harry [HistoryMaker Harry Carson], I would like for you to--," 'cause--you know, I thought I was going to be playing defensive end.  He said, "I want you to consider changing positions."  And I thought to myself, why?  You know, I'm already a pretty good defensive end.  I mean, you know, I'd had like seventeen sacks my senior year [at South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], some--something like that, and I was pretty good at what I did, and so I was a little hurt that they would want me to play a different position.  But then he said, "I would like for you to try playing middle linebacker."  And I'm like, wow, middle linebacker.  And so I immediately felt pressure because the middle linebacker really is the quarterback of the defense.  And so what they did was they sort of paired me up with--and I didn't realize this at the time, but they had me talking to an individual when I was there, and he was asking me all kinds of questions, and his name is Frank Ladata, and long story short, Frank Ladata is a psychologist and he's asking me all of these different questions, and I'm thinking, you know, why is he asking me all this stuff?  And, you know, he's basically doing his job.  I didn't realize it at the time but, you know, he's doing his job asking me questions to see if I had the aptitude to make that transition from being a down lineman to linebacker because you're taking on a whole lot of other responsibility and just stuff that you have to be able to, you know, take on.  And so, you know, eventually I found out who Frank Ladata was, and Marty asked me and I said, "Okay, I'll come back," and I spent a whole month with Marty and, you know, he shared with me what their plans were.  I'd go out on the field with him, you know, during our little practice session, and everything that he tried to get me to do, I did it ass backwards, but I got the same or better results.  And so I sort of did things my way.
Speaker 2: Was it more in terms of movement or pivots, I mean, like actual choreography, or was it you just did the opposite of what he asked you to do?
Speaker 1: I did it--it was the movement, it was, you know, being able to get from one point to another point and, you know, the stance or how I would open up to get to a certain point.  And I guess Marty--and I have to hand it to him, he was astute enough to understand that I was--excuse me--he was smart enough to understand that I was a very athletic linebacker and you don't mess with those individuals who have that athleticism, that you find a way to get them on the field.  And he allowed me to do things my way, knowing that I was getting the same or even better results, you know, getting to a certain point doing it my way as opposed to his way.  And so at some point, he threw up his hands and he said, "As long as you get the job done then, you know, I'm okay with it."
Speaker 2: This is--this kind of reminds me of what I heard about one of the early basketball players.  You know, the--one of the early, I think Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton [Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton] dribbled the ball behind his back and between his legs and the--one of the other players tried to slap him 'cause he couldn't figure out why he was--you know, he had never seen it before.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That--you know, there's a fear in sports, you do things this way and then there are--when black folks enter the same sports and are used to doing them another way, it's a cultural kind of a clash--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --as part of it.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know if that's part of it but, you know, I'd been--I'd been sort of trained to do things a certain way, and we didn't necessarily have all of the equipment that, you know, the guys at University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina] had 'cause I did train prior to the draft at South Carolina.  And so when I walked into their athletic facility, I mean, it was like, the lights came on, and it was like some place you'd never seen before, all of the weight equipment with all of the Nautilus [Nautilus, Inc.] machines and so forth.  We didn't have all of that.  We had one weight machine that--it had different stations, and that's what we had.  And so we made do with what we had and we got the same or better results as a result of doing it our way.
Story_ID: 519514
Speaker 1: Now, this is a point that you make in the book ['Captain for Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson], and just reemphasizing that the middle linebacker position is a brain position on the team.  It's the quarterback of the defense as you said, and very up to the point that you became--you know, that Marty Schottenheimer, who is a pretty good football mind, selected you as middle linebacker.  Very few black people had played the position, right?
Speaker 2: Well, that's why they made him get up in the meeting to declare who he was going to draft because if I had been a bust, I would've been Marty's bust.  I would not have been Bill Arnsparger's bust, I would not have been the Mara family's bust.  I would've been Marty's bust.  And so, that was the significance of them, you know, getting him up--Marty, who do you want to take?  And then I became his project.  And so the onus was on him to make sure that I was able to play the position and then make the transition.  And so we had some conversations, and he was very clear that there were people who did not think that I had the athletic or intellectual ability to make that transition.  And so I knew that if I was a bust it was gonna be on Marty.  'Cause I could've gone on and, you know, threw up my hands and said, "Nah, I don't wanna play middle linebacker.  I don't care.  I'm gonna go back.  I'm gonna go teach."  But I took it on as a challenge.  And Marty told me, he said there were people who doubted me because people at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] did not play the same caliber of ball--
Speaker 1: It's a--
Speaker 2: --at--
Speaker 1: It's a tiny school.
Speaker 2: Tiny school, enrollment of five thousand, maybe six thousand.  They didn't play the same kind of ball that they played at Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] or Alabama [University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama] or Southern Cal [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] and so, I mean, he was making the point, and he shared that with me.  And so I always remember that, you know, there were people who doubted me.  And, I think as a result, and we talked about this earlier, there are others who have gone to HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], and they go there understanding that there are going to be people who are going to doubt them.  So, you have to bring your best.  You got to bring your A game every time because we all got on--we all have like experiences.  We didn't--you know, we played for schools that didn't have the budget to have pristine, great athletic facilities.  We all ran a lot.  We did things like Walter Payton and--you know, he'd run the hill, Jerry Rice, he did certain things, you know, "Too Tall" Jones [Ed "Too Tall" Jones], he did certain things at Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], but we all did our own thing to--and then we took it to the NFL [National Football League].  And while we never talked about it, we all knew that we were there representing black colleges.  It's something that's innate--it's ingrained in you that you represent where you come from and so, you know, we had to give our all, but also be cognizant that people are watching us and how we act.  And so when you've gone to a black school, you understand that if you screw up, you know, your professors won't like it, the fans that you went to school with, they won't like it.  And so, there's that onus on the athlete that you better represent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, what was--was there a NFL, welcome to the NFL moment in training camp or?
Speaker 2: I don't think there was a welcome to the NFL moment.  I think that I was sort of learning my way.  I wasn't a starter [for the New York Giants].  I knew what my role was.  I was on special teams and I was on second string.  And so I accepted that.  And I saw that the game--when you're in training camp in practice, there's a certain speed that you go to, but when it's the regular season, it's like everybody is moving at warp speed.  And so I sort of recognized early on that, you know, you really got to bring it because those guys who are playing, you know, regular positions, the starters, you know, they're not shucking and jiving.  I mean, they are bringing it.  And so I knew that I was gonna have to elevate my game if I was gonna step on the field.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are plenty of people who are drafted, just recently, Johnny Manziel and some others who have disappointed when they got to the pros because things were just--they're a lot different.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 519515
Speaker 1: As it turned out, we did not have a very good 1976, my rookie year.  We--midway through the season, Marty [Marty Schottenheimer] said, "You're starting."  And when he said that, you know, it was--I was nervous because here I am, going to be a starter in the National Football League [NFL]--
Speaker 2: In the biggest market in the country.
Speaker 1: In the biggest market in the country playing a position I had never played before.  And so we were playing the Minnesota Vikings, and that was the game which I started, and Fran Tarkenton was the quarterback, Chuck Foreman was the running back, and they ran a lot of plays right up the middle, right over me.  And it was up to me to stop it; otherwise, they were gonna keep running it.  And so once I was able to stop it, then they ran other plays.  But, I had to establish myself as a guy who was going to protect my area.
Speaker 2: So, they target a rookie (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you're--
Speaker 2: --right?
Speaker 1: Oh, you're, you're--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --like fresh meat.
Speaker 2: --you come in, they're gonna run right at you.
Speaker 1: You're the weakness.  You're the weakness on, on the defense.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, Arnsparger [Bill Arnsparger] is the coach.  He's the architect of the Killer Bees [sic. No-Name Defense] in Miami--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --right, when they won the championship in '72 [1972] and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that sort of thing?  So, he's a defensive coach by trade.
Speaker 1: And the reason why they gave me number fifty-three is they envisioned me being like Bob Matheson, who had played with the Miami Dolphins; he wore number fifty-three.  And so that fifty-three position could play middle linebacker, down lineman, you know, rushing the quarterback, whatever.  But they never really asked me to do any of--all that other stuff.  They just wanted me to be a run-stopping middle linebacker.  That was my role.
Speaker 2: Now, there was a--now, I don't know if it's the first year, but you met Howard Cosell at a 'Monday Night Football' game and he addressed you personally, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We were--I think we were in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] my rookie year, and he said--we were at the hotel and he was--I guess he was staying at the same hotel we were staying at, and he said, "[HistoryMaker] Harry Carson from little South Carolina State College [South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], some said he's too small to play the position."  And when he--I mean just--because he recognized me as Harry Carson from little South Carolina State, I--that was a true compliment to me.  And then we played the game against the Steelers [Pittsburgh Steelers].  It was an exhibition game.  And he--I didn't hear it.  I mean, there was no VHS tape or anything there, but there were people that said Howard Cosell spoke of me on 'Monday Night Football,' and how, you know, everybody was so excited because he talked about South Carolina State and how Barney Chavous had gone to South Carolina State and Donnie Shell, and here I was playing from little--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --South Carolina State.
Speaker 2: And from what I understand, he projected you as a future star.  He said quite possibly--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, could be a future star in this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --league, you know, that type of thing.  So, this is--this is a big deal.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--but, the--you said it was a bad first year, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You really didn't--so, what, what do you think?  What was the--what was the problem?  The Giants [New York Giants] had been a pretty good team in the '60s [1960s], I remember that when the great Sam Huff was middle linebacker, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think the problem with the Giants at the time was much like the problem with South Carolina State.  They had a lot of guys who had talent, but didn't have heart.  And then they had a lot of guys who had heart but they didn't have talent.  And, you know, there were guys who had misplaced priorities.  There were guys who probably looked at their own interests and not necessarily what was best for the team.
Story_ID: 519516
Speaker 1: People, I think they tend to think about sports as how fast--like the combine, how high you can jump, how fast you can run, how hard you can hit, how much you can lift, but you're describing personality traits combined with talent, and this is what--you're saying, this is what makes the team work.  Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when you're looking--when you're a player and you are putting the team first, you want to do everything that you can to be the best player that you can be so that when you're on the field that you're giving your best.  If you're an offensive lineman, you want to have the mindset that you want that running back to run behind you when he needs a yard to get, you know, first down.  And there were some guys who just weren't bringing it.  I mean, they just--I mean, they had been highly talented when they were coming out of college, but for whatever reason, they just were not showing what they could have done, you know, when they're on, on the field.  I'll give you a good example.  The Giants [New York Giants] had Larry Csonka as a running back.  When he played for Miami [Miami Dolphins], he was a bruising running back who would run over people.  Well, he went into the World Football League and, you know, he played--
Speaker 1: But he was paid a lot of money.
Speaker 2: He was paid a lot of money, but then he came to the Giants and people expected him to do the same thing with the Giants.  But what people did not understand was he did not have the same offensive line.  Those guys from the Giants, I mean, they--it was a--those guys weren't very good, and so he had no place to run.  And so eventually, Csonka left, went back to Miami.  When he went to Miami, he rushed for almost a thousand yards because he was running behind a solid offensive line, didn't have the same solid offensive line with the Giants.  So, you--Larry Csonka becomes ineffective if he doesn't have people in front of him blocking for him.  Craig Morton had been our quarterback, not very good, but he leaves, he goes to Denver [Denver Broncos] and he takes them to the playoffs.  And so, you know, I'm asking myself, why couldn't he do that here?  Well, he didn't have the offensive line, he didn't have the receivers, but when he went to Denver, he had the receivers.  He had the offensive line.  So, you know, it's up--you know, it--the onus is on the players to perform and all the players weren't performing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And management's got to look--management has got to look at more than just--they have to look at the whole (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, they--
Speaker 1: --situation, right?
Speaker 2: They can't necessarily see the heart of the player.  When you're on the field, you know what--if I'm playing against you, you know what my heart is as I'm playing against you.  You'll know.  Like I knew what Thomas Holliday's heart was because he knew he wasn't gonna get into the game, but he was gonna see to it that he was gonna create a--he was gonna be a fit for me to deal with, and he took great pride in that.  You know, when you have owners or GMs [general manager] and, you know, they're frustrated because this coach [Bill Arnsparger] who is a legendary defense coordinator who--now a head coach, he can't get the most out of these players.  And so for me--it was frustrating for me 'cause I knew these guys.  They were all good guys, but they weren't necessarily, you know, the, the greatest players on the field.  And I came from a situation at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] where, you know, we were good.  And so I was a little frustrated and I thought to myself, let me do everything I can do to help my team win.  And so I just sort of focused on me and doing everything that I could do, and let the chips fall where they may, and as a result of that, you know, I made the All-Rookie Team and then I went onto receive other honors, but for me, it was just, you know, I don't--can't get bent out of shape over--yeah, I want to win, but I can't get bent out of shape over, you know, other people not doing their job.
Story_ID: 519517
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Halfway through the year, you're the starting middle linebacker for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for the--
Speaker 2: Giants.
Speaker 1: --New York Giants, and what--do you--were you being fairly compensated you think for--contractual wise (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think any player you ask will say, you know, he's not being fairly compensated, but at that time, I got a $20,000 signing bonus and my first year's salary was $32,500.
Speaker 1: So, this is more than your parents [Gladys Eaddy Carson and Edgar Carson, Sr.] were making then.
Speaker 2: Right.  And when I started playing as a starter, I think our general manager, Andy Robustelli, could see that I was giving more than what they may have anticipated, and he said that he'd like to redo my contract.  And so--yeah, I sort of waited and waited and waited and nothing really happened.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you should've been more aggressive at that juncture maybe.  I guess you don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I had an agent and, you know, I was leaving that up to the agent.  But, you know, there was nothing going on between my agent and Andy Robustelli.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I sort of had my own theory as to what may have taken place.
Story_ID: 519518
Speaker 1: Now, in 1978, your first child, Aja Carson [Aja Carson-Gurley], is born.  It's a daughter, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I was dating--when I first went to the Giants [New York Giants], our training camp was in Pleasantville, New York, in Westchester County [New York], and at the time, we had to practice in--we had to practice in Pleasantville the whole year.  It was the year that Giants Stadium [East Rutherford, New Jersey] opened.  They weren't quite ready for us to, you know, become tenants there.  As I was living in Ossining, New York, and I met a young lady [Ann Cherry] and, you know, we started dating and as a result of our relationship, a child was conceived, and I was scared to death because at that point, my mother [Gladys Eaddy Carson] was living in South Carolina.  She had relocated back to South Carolina.  And, so I was--you know, I--the way I was born, you know, I was born in church and don't want to do anything out of wedlock, and here I was, you know, pending fatherhood, and I could not tell my mother that she was going to be a grandmother.  And I remember my sister going to her room, and she didn't wake up.  And apparently she had had like an aneurysm.  And she went to a local hospital in Florence [South Carolina], and then we flew her from Florence to Duke University Medical Center [Durham, North Carolina].  And, you know, she was there for a few weeks, and then my daughter, Aja, was born on June 2nd.  When my brother told my mother that she was a grandmother, she was on monitors and everything, and her monitors fluttered, so there was some consciousness there.  Long story short, two weeks later, she passed away, which to me, you know, if you're gonna lose your mother, it was a blessing that she was alive and at least showed some kind of indication that, you know, she was a grandmother, and I was wrong for that.  And I loved my mother so much that I was able to transfer my love for her into my love for my daughter.  And so in a way, I was losing the woman in my life and then I was gaining a woman in my life.  And so the relationship between me and her mother did not survive.  We were two entirely different people, but, you know, I became a father and I loved being a father to my daughter, reading her stories and taking care of her and all of that stuff.  So, now, she's like thirty-something, and she's still a daddy's girl.  Just like I was a mama's boy with my mother, she's a daddy's girl.
Story_ID: 519519
Speaker 1: What was your impact on your old neighborhood?  How did people feel about you?  Because you started to become a star.  Your second year, you're like Linebacker of the Year I think and you make the Pro Bowl.
Speaker 2: I think it was third year, I was--
Speaker 1: Third year?  Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was NFC Linebacker of the Year and then the fourth year I was NFC Linebacker of the Year again.  So, yeah, I was beginning to acquire accomplishments and, you know, it felt good in that I was doing my job, I was doing what I was supposed to do, and I was doing the best to my--of my ability.  The team wasn't really going anywhere, but I was being recognized for my play, which is tremendous because most players, they're sort of locked in with, well, the team sucks so he sucks.  Instead, there were guys were who were saying, you know, "The team, the Giants [New York Giants] suck, but that Carson [HistoryMaker Harry Carson] is really good."  And I remember Randy White who played with the Dallas Cowboys.  I was a little disgruntled about my contract and I wanted out.  And we went to the Pro Bowl together in Hawaii.  I remember Randy bought me a pitcher of beer, I don't drink, and he said, "Harry, I would be honored to play in front of you."  And to have a guy of that stature say I would be honored to play in front of you is high compliments.  And so, you know, my frustration with the team, I had to set that aside and I had to go back to South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], and my attitude was, let me do everything I can do to help the team win.  At that point, it's out of my hands.  And so when I would walk off the field--I'd play the Eagles [Philadelphia Eagles] or the Steelers [Pittsburgh Steelers] or whoever, as I'm walking off the field, it was like a symbolic thing.  I'd look back and I'd ask: did I do everything I can do to help the team win?  If the answer was yes, then it's out of my hands.  There's nothing I can do about it regardless of the score.  There's nothing I could do--I did my best.  And so I just always leaned on, as long as I'm giving my all, then it's out of my hands.  And so--
Speaker 1: It seems like an axiom that will--applies to the rest of everything in life.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And so the significance--and I went to nine Pro Bowls, and the significance of going to nine Pro Bowls is when I was elected--and at that point, at that time, the Pro Bowl, you were chosen by the people who you played against, and so that was high praise that the people you played against would vote for you to go and represent, you know, the NFC [National Football Conference].  And so--
Speaker 1: So, now it's the fans, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that vote or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It's more of a popularity contest.  And so, yeah, I mean, it was a big thing for me.
Story_ID: 519520
Speaker 1: You watched a lot of film.  I know it says you watched Jack Lambert and--but, Bill Bergey of the Eagles [Philadelphia Eagles] was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You saw him as the best--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was a rookie--
Speaker 1: --example.
Speaker 2: --and I was trying to make that transition, you know, I, I watched a lot of middle linebackers play and I sort of focused in on Jack Lam- not, not Jack Lambert, but Bergey, and, you know, he was in my division, and everything that Bill did, I tried to do better.  We both played middle linebacker position.  Jack Lambert was a little different in that he had a very dominant defensive line in front of him, whereas the Eagles, they had a good defensive line, but Bill Bergey was doing most of the work as the middle linebacker.  On the cover of that book, 'Captain For Life' ['Captain for Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson], I can tell you exactly when that was taken, my rookie year, I came off the field, Marty Schottenheimer had just gone over adjustments and so forth, and so after he was done, I went and sat on my helmet and I was just watching Bill Bergey, what he was doing.  And I was striving to be like him.  I was sitting on that helmet watching every move that he made.  He had a wad of tobacco in his jaw, and I didn't do tobacco, but I must've taken like twelve, fifteen sticks of gum and got that big wad, you know, just like he had.  And I was doing everything that he was trying to do.  So, yeah, I was basically emulating him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's interesting.  That's the way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a lot of kids, they watch somebody on TV--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they try to be, be--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like them.  But, I guess that's how the world works.
Story_ID: 519521
Speaker 1: So, '78 [1978], '79 [1979], you're starting to hit your stride and the top teams in the NFL [National Football League] in those days were--correct me if I'm wrong now, the Pittsburgh Steelers, I know I'm right about that one, but, I guess, the Raiders [Oakland Raiders], Redskins [Washington Redskins], I know those were the--seemed to be the ones that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, the--you're talking about the Steelers, that was my--I have to back to my rookie year now, that was my welcome to the NFL moment because with Marty [Marty Schottenheimer] trying to teach me how to be a middle linebacker, he would say, you know, 4-3 defense, and I'm head up with the center, I had to read the center to find out where the ball was going to go.  And it was good that I played that nose tackle position at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] because that sort of gave me an understanding of what I'm looking at.  So, we're playing the Steelers in Giants Stadium [East Rutherford, New Jersey], and it goes like this.  When the center blocks back, you step up 'cause that's where the ball is--they're gonna run a trap.  And so in my head, I'm thinking center block back, step up, center block back, step up.  And so Mike Webster is the center, and he breaks the huddle, sprints to the line of scrimmage, and he's got like Vaseline, baby oil, whatever, all over his arms.  He's--look like he's just been pumping iron in the locker room, but he's all pumped up.  So, he snaps the ball, he blocks back.  When he blocks back, in my head I'm thinking, when the center blocks back, step up, that's where the ball is coming.  And so when he blocks back, I step up.  There's a guy by the name of Sam Davis who is a guard; he comes down and he traps me.  He might've been guard or a tackle.  He comes down and when I step up, I don't see him coming, I'm looking at the running back.  And he hits me right here and he plows me down into the ground.  And it was the hardest hit I've ever taken on the football field.  It was like I took a massive shot of novocaine and my whole right side was frozen.  I couldn't feel anything.  And so that was my welcome to the NFL moment.  When I got up off the ground, my helmet was faced sort of here and I was looking through the ear piece.  I mean, he hit me--he hit me that hard.
Speaker 1: Now, you were describing in the book ['Captain for Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson] Chuck Noll's Pittsburgh Steelers, as every lineman sprinted to the line (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --every one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they were--they seemed to be ready in a different way than the New York Giants.
Speaker 2: Oh, they were on a different timeframe than everybody else.  Like, we called the defense 4-3, you know, Cover 3 [Cover 3 defense], break the huddle, everybody sort of meanders about.  And when they broke the huddle, they sprinted to the line of scrimmage, and they were ready and they were determined.  I mean, that's the reason why they won four championships in the '70s [1970s].  You know, it's that whole mindset.  I mean, they were psyching people out.  And Mike Webster, at that time, he was the strongest man in the National Football League.
Speaker 1: And I think you also wrote that they wore, the linemen, offensive linemen worse the tightest jerseys (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jerseys.
Speaker 1: --they could so you can't hold them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You can't get a hold of them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, that's what--they would wear jerseys that were so tight--and then they would put like a string around the side to tie it even tighter so that you couldn't grab it.  And then some of them sprayed solutions whether it be silicone or Vaseline or whatever so that they would be slippery.  And so they had all the tricks down, you know, as to how not to get manhandled (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Some of this stuff is not legal anymore, right, in the NFL?  I know--I know--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean if you--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) in those days would, would--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --would brush themselves down with Stickum.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, you know, Cliff Branch, you know, those guys, Lester Hayes, you know, I remember him, you know, had Stickum all over himself.  But, I mean, that's the way guys played back--everything that they could get away with, you know, they were gonna do it.  And so, you know, you couldn't blame them.  Everybody is looking for that edge, you know.  But the NFL cracked down, and they have a uniform policy that you can't do certain things.  You can't tear or rip the sleeve, and so since they've imposed, you know, those uniform codes, you know, guys have to do the right thing.  I mean, you can still wear a tight jersey, but you can't lace it up with shoestring.
Story_ID: 519522
Speaker 1: There's something else that you mentioned in your rookie year or earlier in your career that guys were actually taking speed before games.
Speaker 2: I just saw one incident where it was the first game of the season, we're in Washington [D.C.], and I was a little late, you know, leaving the locker room, and I saw two or three of my teammates, you know, doing something.  I was like, "What are you guys doing?"  They were passing out pills, and I was like, damn, you know, just like that, you know, passing out pills, and I could see they were white.  They weren't like salt pills that you would take to minimize cramping or anything like that.  You know, I could tell it was something that was sort of sinister or illegal.  And when we got on the field and I saw the kickoff, and I saw how fast, you know, guys were running down the field, then I understood what they were doing because if you're going to be playing in the regular season--again, it's one thing to play in practice.  It's another thing to go in the preseason game, but when you get into a regular season game, guys are moving at, you know, Mach 2.  When you get into the playoffs, you're looking at Mach 4.  When you get into the Super Bowl, that's like, you know, Mach 5.  So, there's definitely an increase in the intensity and the speed once the season starts.
Story_ID: 519523
Speaker 1: And I failed to mention Willie Lanier.  He's probably the first black middle linebacker in the NFL [National Football League] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I believe.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: From a small black school as well--
Speaker 2: Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: --playing for the, played for the Kansas City Chiefs, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was very much aware of that and I was very much aware that he had played a different position, and, see, that was part of the challenge, that if Willie Lanier can do it, then I can do it.  And so, Willie had been a--somewhat of a hero for me and a role model for me in that he went to Morgan State, you know, he--very cerebral, wasn't just a football player, and I found that out over the years, you know, just watching him play but also now after football, he's more than just a football player.  And so I don't necessarily categorize myself as a football player; I'm someone who played football.  And I was presented with a challenge, just as Willie was, and we were able to make that transition.  And so it was Willie and I think the next one was Harold McLinton, who played with the Washington Redskins.  Harold was a middle linebacker, black middle linebacker, who he was killed helping someone--I don't know whether it was the parkway going around D.C. [Washington, D.C.], but he had stopped his car to help someone and he was killed in an automobile accident.  So, I think that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Willie Lanier--
Speaker 2: Harold McLinton.
Speaker 1: McLinton, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know Willie Lanier won the Super Bowl with the Kansas City super Chiefs back in, what, '70 [1970] I guess?  Seventy [1970], '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 519524
Speaker 1: Moving up into the '80s [1980s], in 1980, this is your fifth season, and injuries start mounting, and you said this is one of the worst seasons you ever had in terms of injuries.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You wanna talk about that?
Speaker 2: I just had a knee injury.  It was--you know, up until that point, I felt like Superman that I could play and do anything I wanted to do, and I injured my knee and I had to sit down for a few weeks.  It was the first time that the doctor had used the arthroscope on a player with the Giants [New York Giants].  Otherwise, they would've like cut the knee open.  I think I had damaged cartilage or whatever, and they did it through scope.  And so I had surgery, and I went through rehab, and like four weeks later, I was back on the field.
Speaker 1: Now, now, [HistoryMaker] Gale Sayers, we did get a chance to interview him and he talked about his knee problems and how the doctors really, if they knew what they later knew, he might've played a few more years.  But they cut his knee open and they tried to tie ligaments together and they made them too tight, and he couldn't move right and he never did feel right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: I was very fortunate in that I didn't have any structural damage; I had cartilage damage that would get into the joint and create a problem.  And so I was able to get back on the field and play during the course of the season and, you know, finish.  I mean, it was--it's a task to come back from, you know, surgery and then rehabilitation and then get back on the field and the scary thing is just taking the hit.  You know, the first time you're back on the field and you're exposing yourself to getting hit again, you know, that's one of the scary things that you have to get over.
Story_ID: 519525
Speaker 1: Now, in the '81 [1981] season, you start to have some second thoughts about football 'cause things--
Speaker 2: I wasn't pleased with my contract, but I also felt like--and this is sort of a prelim that I didn't even think about at the time, I was experiencing something that I couldn't really put my finger on exactly what it was.  Like, I was sort of dealing with, you know, thinking about driving my car off the bridge and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Off the Tappan Zee Bridge, right?
Speaker 2: Off the Tappan Zee Bridge.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I'm like, why would I--why would I think this?  You know, I'd have like periods where I'd slip into like a dark mood and I couldn't understand why.  You know, I'm a ball player.  And, you know, I have money, I have a car, I have a home, why am I feeling like this?  And I couldn't understand why.  And one of those days, I was, you know, like driving to and from practice every day.  You know, I'd see that someone may have driven to the Tappan Zee Bridge, parked their car, and then jumped over.  And I was thinking, for whatever reason, I'm just driving my car through the guardrails and, you know--and I thought to myself, if I did that, what would happen to Aja [Aja Carson-Gurley]?  What would happen to my daughter?  And that sort of brought me back to my senses, but I couldn't understand, why was I thinking that?  Then, you know, other things started to pop up, but that was really the only time that I even thought about doing something harmful to myself.  And I didn't really share it with anyone.  I just sort of kept it to myself because, you know, to share something like that with other people, you know, then they start to look at you funny.  And so I just kept it to myself and, yeah, that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--but you discussed it with Dr. Frank Ladata?
Speaker 2: I didn't really discuss that with him, but what I did do was I had a game where we were playing Philadelphia [Philadelphia Eagles] on 'Monday Night Football' and I wasn't doing everything that I could do to get to the ball carrier and wrap up and make the tackle.  And so I did everything up until a certain point and, you know, I'd hit the guy and bounce off the guy and, you know, he'd go ahead and score a touchdown.  So, I went to Ray Perkins who was the head coach at the time and I said--and I really felt bad because I felt like I had failed the team.  I wouldn't take my paycheck, and I went to Coach Perkins and I said, "You know, I think I'm going to retire."  And he said, "Don't do anything until you speak with me."  And so he called me up the next day and asked me to come in, and I went in with my daughter, and I said I don't know what's going on that, you know, I'm missing all these tackles.  And so something said, call Dr. Ladata.  And so I called him up, made an appointment, went over and spoke to him.  He was at Manhattanville College [sic. Manhattan College, Riverdale, New York], and he put me through what's called task analysis, and it's so simple.  He said, "You know, you're doing everything right until you get to the ball carrier and you're not wrapping up.  Envision, you know, driving, embracing the ball carrier, wrapping up, and taking him to the ground."  Because in practice, you can't tackle the running back.  'Cause I was playing the way I was practicing, but I had to take it two or three steps further when I'm in--you know, prior to, you know, going into the game and having to envision myself making the tackle.  And so as simple as that, you know, I went--I came back the next week and had a nice game.
Speaker 1: Now, some of your teammates [on the New York Giants], I understand, teased you about it, and they also thought you might've really been crazy when you tried to give your paycheck back (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what--that's what they really thought was crazy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--yeah, that's what they really thought, yeah.  But, you know, I'm sort of built that way in that, you know, I wanna earn what I'm getting and I didn't feel like I was earning it.  I felt like I would've been stealing if I had taken the check.
Story_ID: 519526
Speaker 1: So, '81 [1981] is also the year that the New York football Giants [New York Giants] draft Lawrence Taylor, right?  And he's what they would call now a freak, a physical freak in terms of his physical ability to move and--
Speaker 2: His agility and--
Speaker 1: --everybody was just in awe of him, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, so you were a little bit threatened by this from what I understand.
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't say I was threatened by him, but we had I thought a pretty good group of linebackers.  We--Brad Van Pelt, Brian Kelley, and myself, we had--like, Brian was the middle linebacker who I succeeded and then he went to the outside.  Pat Hodson--no, Pat--I forgot his last name (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hughes.
Speaker 2: Pat Hughes--
Speaker 1: Hughes, yeah.
Speaker 2: --was the outside linebacker who went to the bench.  And so Pat was pissed that he lost his position Brian and Brad and I were playing, and so we developed a good relationship, we played off of one another, we were really good, and so we didn't really think that we needed anyone else.  If anything, we needed a good running back to help the offense.  And George Rogers was the running back and, you know, I thought, well, might as well.  They should just go get George Rogers or some kind of offense to help.  And they used the second pick in the draft to select Lawrence Taylor.  And so we were like, no, we don't need another linebacker, we're okay.  And so Lawrence got wind of the fact that we were a little disenchanted with him coming, and so he sort of sent us a message that if we don't want him to come, he doesn't have to, he can go to some other team, blah, blah.  And so when he did come, we welcomed him.  And when we took the field, you know, we knew it was going to be interesting to see, what does this guy have that is so special?  And when we were going through drills and it was one-on-one drills, then we saw how quick and fast and agile he was, and then we understood how the Giants used the second pick to choose Lawrence Taylor.
Speaker 1: Taylor says, you know, he wrote or said to someone, was quoted as saying, you were the person that welcomed him and mentored him--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, first.
Speaker 2: Well, I tried to sort of help him in stuff that was going on, on the field, but I take no credit for anything that happened off the field.  So, you know, I got to know him on a different level and to this day, I don't call him L.T., I call him Lawrence because he's the guy who I first met, he's the guy who I sort of deal with.  That L.T. character is the one who has gotten him in trouble over the years, and I used to--and I still tell him, I said, "You know, you should allow L.T. to commit suicide and just be Lawrence Taylor," because I know Lawrence Taylor and, and there's a goodness about him that, that I saw when I first--when he first came to the Giants.

Speaker 1: All right, 1982, the San Francisco 49ers win Super Bowl XVI, I think, the first of four championships they'll win in the '80s [1980s].  The Bengals [Cincinnati Bengals] are--have a good team and they are--there's--you know, that's the lay of the land.  But, in '82 [1982], you were in a game where you had twenty-five tackles against the Green Bay Packers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the last game on Monday night prior to all the players going out on strike, and I wasn't very optimistic about the resolution of the strike, so I figured, I might as well let it all hang out.  I don't know when I'm gonna come back and play again.  I might never come back and play.  And so I was sort of all over the field, you know, making tackles.  And--
Speaker 1: Is this a record?  Twenty--
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: That's--you know, I hardly remember a game where somebody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm, I'm pretty sure--
Speaker 1: --had twenty--
Speaker 2: --somebody has got more, more tackles than that.  But, I was just out having fun 'cause I did--I just didn't know when I was going to be playing again.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: A typical good game would be ten tackles for somebody.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's outstanding.
Speaker 1: --a real good game.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I was--I was playing like a wild man, I guess.  Everything that came my way, I was trying to hit it.  So--
Speaker 1: And Howard Cosell was telling everybody about it (laughter).  So, the '82 [1982] season is another all-star year.  Did--how did the team do in '82 [1982]?  Was it a--this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't do very well because I think they had replacement players.  No--
Speaker 1: Oh, right.  They played about four or five games.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, we didn't do all that well, and then we came back.  And I know Washington [Washington Redskins] went to the Super Bowl that year because they had better replacement players (laughter).  But the Giants [New York Giants], you know, they just didn't put a whole lot of stock into the replacement players and that was one of the knocks on George Young because the Redskins were, you know, looking to win it, but the Giants, they sort of encouraged us to sort of stay together.
Story_ID: 519528
Speaker 1: One of the heroes for the Redskins [Washington Redskins] was John Riggins, right?  Big fullback, north/south runner.  In 1983, I believe, is when you had the big collision with John Riggins, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.  You know, John was one of those running backs that I enjoyed playing against.  If I was playing against a running back like a--back in the day, Terry Metcalf, who was short and, you know, jittery or somebody like--you know, any number of players who could turn on a dime, that would--you know, I probably would blow my knee out.  John was one of those players that he just ran right over you.  He did not try to avoid you.  And I welcomed players like that who were power inside runners.  And so that was my job.  I was a power run stopper who would, you know, stick it up in there and by any means necessary, you know, stop the play.  And so John and I had a lot of collisions together, and so we were down in RFK [Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, Washington, D.C.] and, you know, the Hogs were sort of in their glory, the offensive line.  They were sort of exerting themselves.  In other words, they were pushing us around as a defense, and Riggins was running right behind them.  And so we just met at some point, and there was this collision of two helmets smacking together, and when the helmets hit together, we both went down and we got up, we went to the huddle, he went back to his huddle, I went back to mine.  And so, when I got back to my huddle, then I could feel myself start to fade.  Everything just sort of went dark.  And I squeezed the hands of the guys who I was standing next to, and by squeezing their hand, you know, it didn't go completely into darkness, but I was able to get my vision back.  And so I was looking over to the sideline; Bill Belichick was my coach at the time, and he flashed in the signal and I didn't know what it was, couldn't comprehend it.  So we have this, this thing that if you don't get the signal, you tap your helmet.  And so I tapped my helmet and then he flashed in the signal again.  I couldn't make--you know, make out what it was, so I flashed my helmet again.  By this time, the Redskins were breaking the huddle and one of my teammates called the defense.  And so I was basically out on my feet.
Story_ID: 519529
Speaker 1: There's a drama on the team when recently retired Doug Kotar got sick and died, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.  Yeah, Doug had retired I think the year before, and he went home to Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, right outside of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and he was playing in the pool with his kids and he got kicked in the head and he started having severe headaches.  Giants [New York Giants] brought him back to New Jersey, operated on him, found he had an inoperable brain tumor and they closed him up and gave him I think like six months to two years.  Yeah, I think he passed away in about a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is a--I know you expressed concern in the book ['Captain for Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson], and there's another place in the book when you were concerned that not every player on the Giants seemed to care as much or do as much for Doug as--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as others.
Speaker 2: You know, I found--you know, all players are different and we all have our tolerance for bad situations.  You know, Doug and I were not close when we played.  I mean, we knew each other and we played together, but we didn't necessarily hang out together.  And so when one of my teammates was--is in distress, you go to that teammate and you help in any way you can.  And so when Doug had his surgery, you know, the guys after practice--the guys who he normally hung out with, they weren't going to see him.  And so, it was the black guys who was going to see him, myself, George Martin, Frank Marion, we would make time to go and visit him.  And then it became me, you know, going to see him.  And so, Doug and I developed a relationship and, you know, I just wanted to be there for him.  They transferred him from Newark [New Jersey] back to Pennsylvania, and I flew out a couple of times to be with him and then he passed away, and I went back for his funeral.
Story_ID: 519530
Speaker 1: Yeah, now you mentioned in another place.  I think that this happens some time into the future here, but there's a--you put a hit on a member of the Seattle Seahawks, and you kind of felt bad about it the way--'cause he was--he clearly wasn't looking the right way when you were able to hit him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and laid him low and you were impressed with Coach John Robinson actually coming out onto the field to see about this.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know if--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know if--I don't know if Coach Robinson was with the Seahawks or--
Speaker 1: Was that the--okay.
Speaker 2: You know, he was with the Rams [Los Angeles Rams] for--
Speaker 1: Or maybe it was the Rams then.
Speaker 2: --yeah, for a period of time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I remember there was a player from the Rams who was hurt and I remember John Robinson when he was at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], and then he was with the Rams, and the thing that I admired about him, he had this cool sort of persona when he was on the sideline.  He didn't get bent out of shape or anything.  But then when his players got hurt, like a lot of coaches, they're on the headset and they're talking, and they're more concerned about the game than the player who is hurt, and I saw the humanity of John Robinson when he took--and when he went out on the field to see how his player was.  And I think every player should appreciate that, that a coach will stop what he's doing to take an interest in his health.  I think any mother who has a child playing would want that for their child, every--any wife would want that for her husband.  And I was so impressed with him doing that.  I mean, it could've been for show, but he earned my respect.  In regards to the player from Seattle, you know, when you're on the football field and, you know, you're out there hitting, you have these, you know, a gang of guys sort of all intermingled together and sometimes, the pile gets pushed a certain way and a knee gets caught, and, and when you hear somebody yelling and you can hear it like in their voice that they are hurt, then I think the humanity of any player comes to the surface.  That was the case with Joe Theismann.  We enjoyed playing against Joe and we loved hitting him, but when he sustained the injury that he sustained, we stop being combatants and we all sort of came together for the sake of Joe Theismann.  Well, with that player from Seattle, you know, I was concerned about him.  During the course of the game, I can't really stop and see what's going on, and--but, when the game was over, I went to the locker room to see how he was, and he had already been taken to the hospital.  So, you don't--when you go out on the field, you don't go out with the intent of hurting anyone.  Unfortunately, that happens as a result of playing the game.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you want to--you want everything to be good with the health of players that you play against.  You want them to walk off the field the same way that, you know, you walked on and off the field.
Story_ID: 519531
Speaker 1: In 1984, I think you start the chapter off by--in your book ['Captain for Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson] about saying--by saying that you could really feel that you'd been in the NFL [National Football League] for nine years.  You started to really feel those nine years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, there's a--there comes a point in time when you feel the wear and tear on your body, and in two thou- 1983, we didn't do very well, and Parcells [Bill Parcells] had taken over as the head coach [of the New York Giants] and he was trying to treat the guys like men and unfortunately, some coaches can't teach or allow guys to be men.  Sometimes you have to keep your finger on them to give their best.  And, so as a result, we just didn't have a very good season because, you know, there were guys who just weren't playing up to their max.  So, out went Brad Van Pelt and Brian Kelley, in came Carl Banks and Gary Reasons.  And so it was--Lawrence [Lawrence Taylor] and I were still there and so we had a new quartet of linebackers and, you know, these guys were younger, fresher, fresher legs, and, and they brought, I think, a different mindset to the game.  I mean, Lawrence and I were good, but these guys, they could run, they weren't afraid to hit, and they were sort of following our cue, and we were better as a linebacking group and as a defense.
Speaker 1: You were playing a 3-4 [3-4 defense] by then, too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, when Lawrence came in, we didn't have a choice but to go to a 3-4.  You couldn't have him on the bench.  And had there been some other coach who went by the traditional way of doing things, you know, somebody would've lost their position and we would've played a 4-3 [4-3 defense] and Lawrence would've been one of the outside linebackers.  For a coach like Parcells who was astute enough to understand the talent that he had, he had solid defensive lineman, a solid nose tackle, and four linebackers who were pretty good at the time and so, you know, we were able to play together.
Speaker 1: Do you think that's the best philosophy?  'Cause some people say it's best to play to a scheme, and then some people say, in basketball or football or in baseball, that you play to your personnel and that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think that you have to understand the talent that you have and utilize that talent in the best way possible.  I, I think that we probably would have been successful with a 4-3, but I think we were even more successful with a 3-4, having the talent that we had on the field, and for that talent to be able to mesh together and play together as one group.  That's so important.
Story_ID: 519532
Speaker 1: Eighty-four [1984], as you said, you were really starting to feel it, and '84 [1984], you started having more headaches and memory issues, and you did some self-speech therapy and some--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --other things that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was captain [for the New York Giants] and I had the first locker in Giants Stadium [East Rutherford, New Jersey].  Like, when you walk in the door and you make a right, you walk right into the locker room, my locker was the first one.  So, any time we had a game, let's say it's a big game, members of the media would conjugate [sic.] around my locker.  And so I would be there kind of holding court and talking about, you know, what we needed to do or what we did, and so you had all of these cameras and microphones in front of me.  And so there were times when I would lose my train of thought or lose the ability to utilize the words that I wanted to convey my point.  And I thought, you know, there's something going on.  Nobody else knew what I was experiencing.  You know, I--you know, went to high school, I had a really good literature teacher, and he taught me words that I'd never been exposed to before.  And so I knew, you know, the words that I needed to use to make my points.  And then I was just reaching for words, and so as people would ask me questions, I would have to process what they asked me and then sort of take a moment to find the words to convey my thought.  And oftentimes, I wound up using a lot of um, um, you know, you know, and in my brain, I'm searching for the right word, but those ums and you knows are just fillers to give me the opportunity to get more time to think of what I--what I wanted to say.  Even sitting here with you today, you know, I've been sitting here and, you know, thinking of the right word to use to convey my point, but that's when I first noticed it.  And so I was still commuting between Ossining [New York] and Giants Stadium, and I would stick in a cassette and its words on tape or Verbal Advantage or whatever, and I'd listen to these words being used to re-familiarize myself with what I was missing.  And so I sort of knew that there was something going on.  I couldn't quite put my finger on exactly what it was and I didn't put the depression from wanting to drive my car off the bridge with choosing the words or, you know, having that faulty memory.  I didn't put all of that together.
Story_ID: 519533
Speaker 1: --When you mentioned the driving, I thought about your offseason job at Grumman [Grumman Aerospace Corporation; Northrop Grumman], which I don't think we mentioned before.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But, during the offseasons you would--you'd work at Grumman Aircraft, right?
Speaker 2: Grumman Aerospace.
Speaker 1: Aerospace.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, aerospace.
Speaker 2: And, you know, I came along during an era in which I knew that I was going to have to do something else after football, that once you sign the contract, you know the clock is ticking.  At some point it's gonna be over, and then what are you going to do?  I was fortunate enough to have my degree.  And so there was an internship program being developed by the Giants [New York Giants], and the guy who was running the program, he was a doctor and, and I forget what his name is, Joel Goldberg [Joel H. Goldberg], that's his name, Joel Goldberg, and he assisted players in getting employment, and the game was so much different then than now.  Then, you had an offseason, you had time to yourself, and you had an opportunity to, you know, go to work.  And now, that's not necessarily the case.  Football is basically a year-round job.  But, I needed to get some work experience because I knew at some point I was going to leave football and I needed to go into something else.  And so I went to work for Grumman Aerospace and I did that for a couple of years, and it was a really good experience because it gave me an understanding of what people in the real world made, you know.  When you're playing football and you're getting a check every week and you're looking at thousands of dollars in this check and, you know, you think it's gonna last forever, but it doesn't, but you have to prepare yourself for when it's no longer going to happen, and the worst thing is to not be prepared.  And so going to work for Grumman gave me a true understanding of what people in the real world made from a salary standpoint.  It also gave me a sense of what I wanted to do and what I did not want to do.  And so, you know, it was a good experience.
Story_ID: 519534
Speaker 1: Back to football.  There's a story you tell about Roger Craig in this game, a Monday night game--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I think on--yeah.  Well, tell the story about Roger Craig and the fake and all that, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were playing San Francisco [San Francisco 49ers] on the Monday night telecast, and it was--a play developed and I was supposed to be man-to-man with Roger Craig if he releases and runs out in the pass pattern.  So, as the play develops, he sort of drifts toward his bench and I'm thinking--I'm looking at Montana [Joe Montana] at quarterback and I'm thinking, "Oh, hell, I got to get to Craig."  And so he flips the ball over to Craig and in my zealousness to get to Roger Craig and then lay him out, I should've used the sideline to sort of help get him out of bounds, but instead, I go to make the tackle.  He takes a step to his right, I go for it and I commit myself, and then he steps back to the left, and he brushes me aside.  And I go down and I look up and he's going down for a touchdown.
Speaker 1: So, that was--they would say today he broke your ankles on the play (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, fast forward, we're in the playoffs and we're playing San Francisco in Candlestick Park [San Francisco, California].  Montana drops back to pass, I go back into my zone, and when he throws the ball, I go up, I catch the ball, when I come down and I secure the ball, who do I see in front of me, number thirty-three, Roger Craig.  And my mind immediately goes back to that Monday night game and the move that he put on me.  I did the same thing.  I gave him a step to the right, he goes for it, I come back and run in for a touchdown.  When I get in the end zone, you know, I'm--everybody is--you know, all my teammates [on the New York Giants] are jumping on me and I'm, you know, jumping around, and I'm thinking to myself, how ironic, how the mind operates that I can do a recall just like that of what happened to me and then turn around and use it against Craig as he has--he used it against me.  So, I found that to be very interesting.
Speaker 1: It is.  It is.  It is.
Story_ID: 519535
Speaker 1: Eighty-five [1985], the Giants [New York Giants] are, under Bill Parcells, are getting better.  They're winning games and one of your teammates, Jim Burt, the nose tackle, invents a new way to celebrate.
Speaker 2: I don't know if he invented it.  We've gotten some pushback from the Chicago Bears, and they said that they invented it.  But, I think it was a Monday when Parcells--we had just won a game and Parcells went to Jim Burt and he said, "You know, that Jeff Bostic, you better watch him, Jim.  You know, he's going to have you for lunch."  And Parcells is the master manipulator and he just kept riding Jim Burt all during the course of the week.  And, you know, Jim is getting himself ready to play, we go into the game, and he keeps asking me, "Is everything okay?"  'Cause he's my protector, you know, with the center.  Is, you know, "Is the guy getting off on you?"  I said, "No, everything is good, Jim."  So, he's playing his rear end off, and so as the game is winding down, Jim comes to me and he says, "You know, that Parcells is such a prick."  And he said, "Oh, he makes me mad.  We should get him with something."  I said, "What do you mean, we should get him?"  He said, "You know, you're Parcells' boy.  You know, he loves you.  I'm just the guy who if I do something to him, you know, he's gonna have my ass."  I said, "Well, Jim, what do you think you want to do?"  He said, "Let's get him with the Gatorade."  And I said, "The Gatorade?"  He said, "Yeah, let's douse him with the Gatorade."  And so he said, you know, "I just want to get him."  I said, "Jim, I'll do it with you."  He said, you know, "He won't bother you but, you know, he might say something to me."  And so as time was winding down, I said, "Don't do anything until he takes his headset off because I don't want him to be electrocuted just in case."  And so as time was winding down, you know, we're behind him and he takes his headset off, and then we get him with the Gatorade.  And so when we got him, nobody really saw it because, you know, it was a one-time thing, it was in the '85 [1985] season and, you know, that was it.  And so we sort of moved on.  But that was the one time that it happened during the eighty--'85 [1985] season for us.  Now, if you ask the Bears, they would say that they did it maybe a year or two prior to that on Ditka [Mike Ditka] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't remember.  You know, I--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I was in Chicago [Illinois] then.  I watched the Bears on Sunday.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't remember--I think Parcells was the first coach I saw doused.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, they may--maybe they're right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, I remember Parcells--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not gonna argue with them--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --because, you know, it doesn't make any difference between who did it.  But the point that you're getting to is, we did it all through the '86 [1986] season, and it really started because we--obviously, we lost to the Bears in the playoffs, and it was a painful experience and everybody thought--you know, we all thought that we were better than the Bears, but we just didn't bring it and we didn't show it on the field.  And so, we came back to training camp and we were all committed.  We were all in, you know, in terms of getting to the Super Bowl the next year.  And so, we had some issues with different players, contract situations and so forth.  And so, starting the season off, we go to Dallas [Texas] and we lose to Dallas [Dallas Cowboys] in Dallas.  And then we started getting hate mail from some fans who said that we'll never amount to anything because we got too many niggers on the team and the white guys are no different, they're a bunch of jerkoffs and blah, blah.  So, it was somebody who was--hated the team and then hated everybody on the team.
Speaker 1: But they sent the mail to you, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they sent the mail to me.  And so the next game, we played the San Diego Chargers, and San Diego the previous week had just beaten the Miami Dolphins, like fifty-five to ten, something like that.  And so we go into the game and we're playing and we wound up beating the Chargers at home.  And so we were so overjoyed that we wanted to celebrate.  And so I thought, get him with the Gatorade.  We did it last year, let's get him with the Gatorade.  And once I got him, and he was totally surprised 'cause he didn't think it was coming again, but once I got him, it became a routine because I had to keep--as long as we won, you had to keep doing it.  And he's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there's a superstition--
Speaker 2: He's a creature of habit--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, if you do something one week and if it works, you have to keep doing it.  And so it wasn't so much that I wanted to do it, I had to keep doing it because of the whole superstition thing with him.
Story_ID: 519536
Speaker 1: Now, you initiated something in '85 [1985] called--this was your Beefsteak Charlie's dinners, right, to build (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like some kind of camaraderie.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We--you know, as a captain, you know, I was trying to think of ways that I could bring the team [New York Giants] together, and so I thought--I went to Parcells [Bill Parcells] and asked, "How much fine money do we have?"  And he told me, I said, "I'd like to take the team to dinner."  And, you know, he always knew I had something--some kind of a little thing going on in my head and I said, "I want to take the team to dinner and I wanna use the fine money to pay for it."  And so, you know, we went to Beefsteak Charlie's, which is a, you know, steakhouse, at--back during that era, and what it did was, it brought the team together because what I found is, you can bring guys together as a team, but until you really get to know that guy personally that you're playing next to, you still don't know who he is.  And so, you can see him as a teammate that you're playing for and in this way, you're seeing him as a man, when you're able to have drinks or have a meal and you're sitting there.  You're not talking football, you're talking about life, you're talking about family, and you're getting to know that guy, and it's like a bond that brings you closer together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it's been said by a lot of people I've interviewed in the [U.S.] military that they are not necessarily fighting for--when they're in a battle situation, it's not so much patriotism that drives them but it's the bond with the other--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --soldier.
Speaker 2: You've been--you've been trained to go--I don't want to use the term go to war, but go on a mission together, and the success of that mission counts on those people who are being trained.  And so one of the things about being hurt, is I used to have some of my best games when I was hurt because I was playing not for me, I was playing for--you know, I would drag my John Wayne one-legged self out there to play because of my teammates.  And so I played with injuries, whether it be high ankle sprain, knee injuries or whatever because it's important for those guys to see me as a leader to be out there with them.
Story_ID: 519537
Speaker 1: You mentioned before, the Bears [Chicago Bears] won in '85 [1985], and you all were--you all had a great season in '86 [1986], and this is--so, you had been playing eleven years by this time?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Eleven years, right.  And--well, tell us about the Super Bowl and--Super Bowl XXI, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, to--yeah, I can tell you about the Super Bowl but, you know, all of that season, we sort of knew that we were gonna go to the Super Bowl 'cause we knew what we had to do.  We had that much confidence.  And so we went through the whole football season.  We lost the first game and then another game in Seattle [Seattle Seahawks] during the course of the year, and it was good for us to lose that game in Seattle 'cause it kept us on track and kept us focused.  The remainder of the year, we beat people into submission, and we knew that in order for us to achieve our goal, we had to really play our best.  And so I felt really bad for some of the teams that we played because we were really physical and we just beat the crap out of them physically.  And then we made the playoffs, played San Francisco [San Francisco 49ers].  They had been our nemesis for a number of years.  And then we played the Washington Redskins.  Obviously, we had a relationship with Washington; that was the third game that we were playing them.  But those games were at our place, and it was so important to have home field advantage.  And then we won, became NFC [National Football Conference] champs, and then had to go to California to play in Super Bowl XXI.  And that really was the fulfillment of a dream for all of us as players because we'd worked so hard to get to that point.  And, you know, it was about making the most of that opportunity.
Speaker 1: This is at the Rose Bowl at Pasadena [California], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, at the Rose Bowl and, you know, you run into the stadium, you're being introduced, and for me, you know, there are a lot of things that are going through my mind, especially those early teams when the team wasn't very good and I'm thinking that I wish some of those players who were a part of those teams could be there.  And in a way, I felt like we were representing all of those guys who had played over the years and never made it to the Super Bowl like Brad Van Pelt and Brian Kelley.  So, it was exciting to run into the Rose Bowl and see a sea of blue and orange, and to see the blimps and the planes flying overhead with the banners and, you know, it's the biggest game that you could ever play in.  And, I'm thinking that first day stepping on the football field and quitting, and I'm thinking about quitting in high school [McClenaghan High School, Florence, South Carolina], and I'm thinking about South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], and here I am; I'm playing in the Super Bowl.  So, you know, there are a multitude of things that are going through my mind as we take the field and it's--you know, people ask, "What does it feel like playing in the Super Bowl?"  And I say, "It's like walking on the moon."  You have to experience it to truly understand what it's all about.  You can't, can't really describe it.
Speaker 1: There's so much enthusiasm.  There's millions of television viewers.  Everything that you do in the game is gonna be scrutinized.  And you're playing the Denver Broncos, who were led by young John Elway, who had just defeated the Cleveland Browns again with a miracle play at the end of--'cause I'm a Browns fan.  I know about it.  The fumble this time instead of the drive.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, here the Denver Broncos are in the Super Bowl.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we knew Denver and we knew that they were a threat any time they stepped on the field.  Elway had a strong arm and they had a really good running attack, they had a very good defense, and we had to rise to the occasion.  Defensively, I felt like we could hang with them.  Offensively, I wasn't quite sure.  I didn't expect Phil Simms to have the game that he had (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he had one of his best games.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 519538
Speaker 1: Long story short, we won the game [Super Bowl XXI], again, one final splash of Parcells [Bill Parcells] with the Gatorade.
Speaker 2: Now, this is a game that--the beginning of the game was called a track meet because your defense was--didn't seem to be very good.
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't that we weren't very good.  I think the Denver Broncos had established a rhythm and they sort of had us off balance.  The other thing was, and nobody really thinks about this, is we had played our final games in cold weather, and so we were well--very much conducive to, you know, cold weather.  And so you're there in the Rose Bowl [Pasadena, California], and the sun is shining and it's like 80-something degrees, and we're exhausted because we're sort of running all over the place and we don't have the cold air that we had, you know, in--playing against Washington [Washington Redskins] and Philadelphia [Philadelphia Eagles].  So, when we go in at halftime, the score is 10-9, and when we come back out, then it's more like Giant [New York Giants] weather because the sun has set behind the stands.  And so the temperature has dropped dramatically; it's probably 58, 60 degrees, and it's nice and cool and it's more conducive for the way that we played the game.  And I think at that point, you know, we elevated our game.  They--you know, we stopped them from doing some things that they had been successful in doing the first part of the game.
Speaker 2: So, I think there was a goal line stand just before the end of the first half where Lawrence Taylor stopped Elway [John Elway] on the goal line--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --came all the way across the field and got him.  Then, you stopped Sammy Winder up the middle, just hit him and stopped him cold.
Speaker 1: And then Carl Banks.
Speaker 2: Then Banks, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then they missed the field goal.
Speaker 2: Then they missed the field goal.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was--that was something that got us really fired up, you know, to have a goal line stand like that.  And any time you stop a potent offense like the Denver Broncos on the goal line, I mean, you get to pat yourself on the back because not everybody can do that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and we were able to do it and walk away from that situation not giving up a point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause they were rolling (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in the first half.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They were rolling.  So, second half, the trick plays, fake punt, flea flickers, all this and Phil Simms wins the MVP [Super Bowl Most Valuable Player] and you all win the game.  So--I mean, any memories about that game that you want to share that you--that I haven't like, you know--
Speaker 1: I just remember that the way that we celebrated, you know, Giants, conservative team, you don't have champagne in the locker room, and so we had Coca-Cola, we had, you know, soft drinks.  Wellington Mara is the owner.  What can we do to get him involved?  We pulled him in the shower, got him all wet.  But, you know, I remember Walter Payton sort of talking about after they won the Super Bowl, there's a hollow feeling that you experience when you win a championship because there are no more mountains to climb.  And so in a way, it's all about the journey, not necessarily about the destination.  And so when it's over, then you're like, okay, what am I gonna do next?  And you have no clue as to what you're going to do next.  You know, as a football player or as an athlete, you're sort of conditioned to train for the next adventure or next journey.  But, you know, we were there on the top of the mountain looking down, so--
Speaker 2: I think Disney [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California] has an answer for you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --when you're--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, the commercial, what are you gonna do next?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You say, "I'm going to Disneyland," yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, he went, not everybody else so.
Story_ID: 519539
Speaker 1: All right, so Super Bowl--there's a--I watched this morning, I saw this kind of a interview on 'The Sports Machine' ['The George Michael Sports Machine'] with you and Lawrence Taylor.  It's kind of a comedy kind of a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had fun.  We--I forgot the name of the guy who was doing 'The Sports Machine.'
Speaker 1: Yeah, I couldn't think of it either for now.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but we had fun.  And--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, after you won a game, you don't mind doing interviews and--
Speaker 1: George Michael.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: George Michael, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And you don't mind doing interviews, and you sort of go with it and you try to be humorous and we felt no pain.  You know, we were in la-la land.  We won the championship [Super Bowl XXI].  And, you know, you don't gloat or anything like that, but you try to have fun.
Speaker 1: Is there a letdown?  'Cause I know the next season, next couple seasons, Giants [New York Giants] still have great personnel.  They kind of reminded me of the Bears [Chicago Bears] when the--after the Bears won in '85 [1985], after the 'Super Bowl Shuffle' and "The Refrigerator" [William Perry] and all the other--Payton [Walter Payton] and everybody, they had a great year in '86 [1986], but they didn't win it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --were good in '87 [1987], they didn't win it.
Speaker 2: I attribute what we went through was the reality of life, in that Karl Nelson, who was our offensive tackle, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease [Hodgkin's lymphoma], a form of cancer, and when you come to training camp and you get that diagnosis, and then I go back to Doug Kotar and I'm thinking, Doug didn't survive.  We also had another player, John Tuggle who was a running back, and he also passed away as a result of cancer.  And so when Karl Nelson was diagnosed, I just sort of went to my own conclusions that, you know, he might not live.  And so at that point, then football becomes irrelevant because you're dealing with the life and the death of--the possible death of someone, and so I don't know if that sort of permeated throughout the team, but we just weren't the same team, and we were more concerned about Karl and his welfare than playing the game.  And then, there was another strike.  And, you know, early on, we just did not play well because of the Karl Nelson situation that I would attribute it to, you know, especially from my standpoint, but then we had a lockout, and by the time we got back, it was too late and we were--sort of dug ourselves a hole with the replacement players and so forth.  You know, no more Super Bowl for us.  That was it and, you know, Washington [Washington Redskins] sort of stepped up and Doug Williams shined--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --when he had the opportunity.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did the--what did you think about that game?  Now, this is the first time a black quarterback started in a--
Speaker 2: I was extremely proud of Doug and what he had to go through to just get the opportunity.  I mean, he went to Grambling [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], drafted by Tampa [Tampa Bay Buccaneers].
Speaker 1: Another small black school [HBCU] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  And so it, it really is a hard road to be accepted and to become the leader in the face of an organization and then get to and win a championship.  Ironically, Washington was playing against Denver [Denver Broncos] and one of my good friends, Mark Haynes, who I'd played with with the Giants, he was being toasted by the wide receivers and Doug Williams.  And so, unfortunately, you know--fortunately, he got to the Super Bowl.  Unfortunately, you know, they threw a lot in his direction and I hated to see that, but that's--you know, that's the game.
Speaker 1: Well, this is a big drama.  As I remember it, John Elway was on fire in the first quarter.  The--Doug Williams actually hurt his knee and went out of the game; they didn't think he would come back.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He comes back, throws five touchdown passes, one after the other.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't pretty.
Speaker 1: They win in a blowout.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it wasn't pretty for Denver.
Speaker 1: And Washington, D.C., celebrated for the next year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 519540
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight [1988] is when there's a drug testing controversy involving you.  What happened?
Speaker 2: We moved our training facility from Pace University [New York, New York] to Fairleigh Dickinson University [Teaneck, New Jersey] and there was a drug screening, and I don't know exactly what happened, but I would only speculate that my urine was switched with someone else's urine and, you know, Bill Parcells called me up, and this is right at the end of training camp, I was at home, I was in South Carolina with my family, and he said, "Carson [HistoryMaker Harry Carson], you disappointed me."  And I said, "Bill, what are you--," 'cause I thought he was calling to say you've been traded or, you know, we're releasing you because I'd already announced that it was going to be my last year.  And he said, "I'm very disappointed in you," and I didn't know what he was talking about.  And then he said, "You tested positive for drugs."  And I said--I laughed until I realized he wasn't laughing.  And then I was like, oh, what's going on here?  And then I started playing all these scenarios.  Somebody had to have changed my urine.  There had to be a mistake in the testing.  I had been suitemates with Lawrence [Lawrence Taylor], and Lawrence also had tested positive.  And so the average person who is a fan, they would probably say, "Well, you know, if Taylor tests positive, Carson probably tests positive, too.  You know, those black guys, they all hang out together, they're probably doing the same thing."  And so I found out that--I had no choice but to go along with the program because by not going along with the program would be like an admission of guilt.  So, I had no power.  And so I had to go through the whole '86 [1986] season peeing in a bottle.
Speaker 1: This is '88 [1988], right?
Speaker 2: Eighty-eight [1988] season.
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight [1988] season.
Speaker 2: My last season.  And so I went through the whole season.  Nobody knew or should have known, but it wasn't quite as private as it was made out to be because when I'd go and, you know, leave my urine, I could see the names of other players who have left urine to be tested.  And so I was--you know, initially it was two days a week and then it was one day a week after a period of time.  And so when my season was over that was the reason I walked away from the game and I never looked back because I felt like there was no one who believed me in the medical department.  Those who were in the position of authority believed that I was guilty.  And so, Parcells believed it, the doctors, trainers believed it.  The only person who did not believe it was Dr. Russell Warren, who was the orthopedic specialist.  He didn't believe it, but everybody else believed it, the Maras, so--we had a situation during the course of that '88 [1988] season where I sustained an injury and, and I elected to have surgery, and I went to Parcells and I said, you know, I want to have--I had loose tissue floating in in my knee joint and the only way that I could come back and play is to have it removed.  And so I went to Parcells and I said, "You know, if I have this surgery, you know, there's no reason for me to go on injured reserve."  I would be able to come back and play, that it would all be based on my tolerance for pain.  So, I went in the hospital, it was a Friday, had the surgery, and when I came out, you know, I saw on television that I was being placed on injured reserve.  So, you know, they went ahead, and before they even knew how I was, they went ahead and put me on injured reserve, denying me the opportunity to play the--not the final four, but four of the last five games.
Speaker 1: They did pretty bad in those last--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --games from what--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from what I understand.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then I dressed up with George Martin, went out on the field, the last home game for the Giants [New York Giants], and bid farewell to the all the Giant fans.  But, nobody knew of the drug situation, the drug allegations that were posed against me.  And then the final game, we played the New York Jets at home.  We lost the game and I ran off the field with a smile on my face and that was it.
Story_ID: 519541
Speaker 1: The one thing I didn't mention about the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XXI], and this is an interesting piece about Parcells [Bill Parcells], if--Parcells seemed like he would be the last one to believe that you were really using drugs.  Because he--'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --'cause the--you know, the one I'm talking about, the coin toss--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where you go out there and actually your hero, Willie Davis [HistoryMaker Willie D. Davis]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's flipping the coin.
Speaker 1: --throwing the coin up.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Parcells chose--well, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, we were warming up to play the game and, you know, as a captain, I'm waiting on the sideline for the other two captains, Phil [Phil Simms] and George [George Martin], and I'm thinking, a game of this magnitude, I'm sure they want to go out for the coin toss.  And so Phil was warming up, I don't know where George is, and one of the officials is waiting to take me out to the center of the field, and Parcells said, "Carson [HistoryMaker Harry Carson], go ahead and go," and I said, "But what about Phil?  What about George?"  He said, go.  The official started walking, I had to go with him.  And so as I'm walking towards the center of the field, I'm thinking to myself, oh, man.  I'm representing the whole Giant [New York Giants] organization and Giant fans, and I look across the field and there's Elway [John Elway] and there's all these other players, like four or five players.  It looked like it was about eight, but I think it was five players walking toward me.  And so, you know, I go out for the coin toss, I lose the toss, but in my head, I'm thinking, this is the ultimate compliment to be sent out by myself.  And so when that happened, you know, I won a championship, I played the next year, and we had young talent on the team, I'd just had enough.  I just wanted to go and get on with my life.  It wasn't that I didn't want to play.  I--you know, I just wanted to get on with living the rest of my life.  And so I made a choice to walk away from the game.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so when George and I left, the following May--no, the following February, Bill Belichick called me up, and they had started something like the--it's called the Plan B free agency, and they said they were putting me on Plan B.  "Okay, but I'm not playing anymore."  And so what that is is it exposes you to other teams to select--they could select you to play.  And so I got four invitations from teams to play, San Francisco [San Francisco 49ers], Miami [Miami Dolphins], Washington [Washington Redskins], and someone else.  But then, Parcells called me up at the end of the Giants minicamp, and he asked me to consider coming back because losing me and George at the same time was too much leadership.
Speaker 1: This is George Martin, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah--to lose at one time.  And so I gave it some thought and my wife [Shari Carson] at the time 'cause I had gotten married in '88 [1988], my wife at the time, I ran it by her, and she said, "Fuck Parcells."  And so she was irate because, you know, she knew what I was going through.  And so I called him back and I said, "Bill, thanks, but no thanks.  I don't want to play anymore."
Story_ID: 519542
Speaker 1: And I probably could have played another five, six years like Jackie Slater from--you know, 'cause the guys who played at the black schools [HBCUs], we have that longevity.  We know how to play the game.  So whether it's "Too Tall" [Ed "Too Tall" Jones] or Jackie Slater or Walter Payton or Jerry Rice or--we are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Jerry Rice played a long time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so we--
Speaker 2: And Donnie Shell.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, I could've played longer, but I just didn't want to play anymore.
Speaker 2: Now--okay.  In--so, what did you do immediately afterwards?  Did--
Speaker 1: Immediately afterwards, I started doing television with CNN.  The original plan was to go and do something with the networks, but when I went and I did my audition, I was not able to do it as well as other people who had auditioned.  And so to be able to talk about what I'm seeing and put it in my own words and be fluid, I wasn't able to do that.  So, that was another sign of what I was sort of dealing with.  And so I went to work for Madison Square Garden Network and then CNN.  I was doing a weekly show on CNN and MSG.  And then I was doing something with the Big East college network [Big East Network].  I was doing, you know, college football as well with ABC and the Big East [Big East Conference].  And so, long story short, I would lose my train of thought live on the air, and the Big East fired me during the course of the season, and, you know, I was able to work a year with CNN and then MSG, I've been doing that ever since 19--you know, I'm still doing a show with MSG since 1989.
Story_ID: 519543
Speaker 1: Giants [New York Giants] win their second Super Bowl in 1991, and this is under a different coach, right?  Or is it--is this Bill Parcells (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it's still under Parcells.
Speaker 1: Still under Parcells?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is their second one, that's right.  Okay, not the latest one.  But--so, what were your thoughts about that second one?
Speaker 2: I was very happy for the team.  There's a reason why I didn't want to come back.  I had players like Carl Banks and Pepper Johnson who were my proteges, and I think I influenced them in such a way to carry on the tradition of Giant defense and Giant linebackers and so forth, and it gave them the opportunity to shine.  So, I'm glad I never went back because that's their opportunity, not mine.  But, I was very proud of them.  I felt like a proud papa watching them succeed and do all that they did to win a second championship.
Speaker 1: Now, there's a question I want to ask.  I--this just occurred to me, that I know I saw an episode of 'Seinfeld' once when he was--they were questioning, you know, fandom, I guess, and he says, like, "What are we rooting for?"  He said, are we rooting for--I mean, the New York Giants, say, they've got people here from South Carolina, Florida, California, Michigan.  I mean, they're not from New York.  We're just rooting for the laundry, aren't we?  It's the laundry, a suit.
Speaker 2: No, you're, you're rooting for the team, but when you have an assemblage of individuals who are from all different walks of life, religions, different childhoods, political persuasion, colors, and you get all these guys to play together, and they're playing under this one roof or this one uniform, they're representing a certain entity.  And so for Giant fans, they're rooting for the colors.  Yeah, they're rooting for the uniform.  They're not necessarily rooting for the player, but they're rooting for their colors, red, white, and blue.  The Jets [New York Jets] are green and white, Buffalo [Buffalo Bills], red, white, and blue, Steelers [Pittsburgh Steelers], black and gold.  You're rooting for the uniform, and you know, those individuals who are in those uniforms, you know, you love them, but you don't love them so much that you--to understand that next year, they might be in somebody else's uniform, so you're gonna hate them.  You love them this year, but you're gonna hate them next year.  So, you're really rooting for the uniform.
Speaker 1: So, it may be laundry, like you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: You wear the laundry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.
Speaker 1: It's--but, you know, now--
Speaker 2: As long as your laundry wins, that's the most important thing.
Speaker 1: There's another thing here, too.  You just--you, you talked about a tradition you were trying to build with Pepper Johnson and Carl Banks, and--about the Giant way of playing defense.  And, you know, those who follow sports know that the Bears [Chicago Bears] until recently, I mean, had, had a tradition of defense.  Up until they won that '85 [1985] Super Bowl, every Bears team going back had this defensive pride.  My dad used to say, the Bears may not win the game, but they're gonna beat up everybody on your team.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what they said about the Steelers, too.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, that's the way that they talked about the Giants.  You know, when I was drafted, and I didn't say this when we were talking about it, but when I was drafted, I didn't want to come to New York, and I wanted to go any place in California where I didn't have to wash my car every other day.  And so when I came to New York and when I became familiar with the rich history and tradition of the Giants, then I embraced it.  When you learn about the players who have played, who have worn the uniform, when you talk about Y.A. Tittle, and Dick Modzelewski, and Rosey Brown, and Rosey Grier, and Sam Huff, you know, those are all legendary names.  And when I came to the Giants, I said to myself, I want to be mentioned--when I leave, I want to be mentioned in the same breath as all of those other great players who have played.  And so that was one of the things that I was striving for when I played the game, to be mentioned in the same breath as those other players to be a great player for the Giant organization.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so when it was over, you know, I left, and then in 2010, I was inducted into the Giant Ring of Honor [New York Giants Ring of Honor] with all of those names.  And so I accomplished what I was looking to do, to be mentioned in the same breath as all of those other great players.
Speaker 1: So, it took you until 2010 for them to induct you into the Ring of Honor (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that was the first year--
Speaker 1: Oh, they had it.
Speaker 2: --of the Ring of Honor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I was gonna say, you were in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Hall of Fame [Pro Football Hall of Fame, Canton, Ohio] in 2006, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But that was the first time that they instituted a Ring of Honor and I was in the inaugural class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 519544
Speaker 1: In terms of legacy, 2006, you were inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame [Canton, Ohio], the NFL [National Football League] Hall of Fame.  Now, this is something that a lot of people thought should've happened much earlier.  Well, what is your analysis of what happened?
Speaker 2: I don't really think about it.  You know, when I played, I think I left everything that I had on the field and I chose to leave when I--when I wanted to leave.  So, I didn't really think about it.  And then, you know, five years after I left the game, it was announced that I had made the preliminary list for the Hall of Fame.  Everybody, you know, much fanfare and it was good.  Then, a few years later, I'd made the final twenty-five and everybody was excited, and then I made the final list, the top fifteen, and then it really heated up and there was, you know, a feeling that, you know, you're gonna go into the Hall of Fame and I never really thought about it, but it--the way that most people thought about it.  I thought, if I make it, fine; if I don't make it, no big deal.  And so I waited, you know, the five years that I was on that--no, I think I waited about eight years as a finalist to get into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  And I wrote letters to people at the hall of fame asking them to remove my name from consideration.  To be mentioned as a possible hall of famer was a nice honor, but to go through that situation year after year and not make it, in essence, I sort of looked at myself as becoming the Susan Lucci of football.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's always up for the--
Speaker 2: For the--
Speaker 1: --Emmy Award and never--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --wins it.
Speaker 2: And she--and she never won.
Speaker 1: 'All My Children,' Susan Lucci.
Speaker 2: And so I found that it became distracting for me and--you know, any time I'd run into people, they'd say, you know, "You're a great player, you should be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame."  And when you get enough of that, you become tired of it.  I'd go to dinners at the Waldorf [Waldorf Astoria New York, New York, New York], charity dinners and--you know, and the emcee would get up and be announcing people and they'd say, "And this man should be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, [HistoryMaker] Harry Carson."  And then it became analogous to me.  I mean, it was like this thing is hanging around my neck.  And so I made a decision to take my family to Hawaii.  I took all of my family there.  My oldest brother [Sonny Carson] passed away while we were there, and I told my family, I'm, you know, gonna elect not to--well, elect to have my name removed from consideration.  They understood the situation 'cause it affected them more than it affected me 'cause every year, they would be heartbroken that I wouldn't get in.  And so I just wanted to put an end to it.  And I said, enough is enough.  I wrote the letter, I sat it on my desk for two weeks, and I thought to myself, if I change my mind, I'll just rip it up.  I didn't change my mind, so I stuck it in the mail.

Speaker 1: Now, you got in [to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Canton, Ohio], and I'm gonna go back to the induction ceremony in a minute, but I wanna go maybe back in time again to the NFL [National Football League] and its history around brain injuries.  Nineteen ninety-four [1994]--if I miss something, correct me, but in '94 [1994], the NFL established the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury committee, the first attempt by the league to formally study the impact of hits to the head on its players.  In 2002, Mike Webster, the--who would you--who'd you say was one of the strongest men in the NFL, the center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, dies and his brain is examined by Dr. Bennet Omalu in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and he's--and Bennet Omalu diagnoses (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Makes a--
Speaker 1: --chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And this is--so, this is a--and Bennet Omalu, they did a 'Frontline' piece on him and you were quoted in that film as well.  Bennet Omalu had made a film ['Concussion'] about his diagnosis starring Will Smith and--about what happens when you challenge the NFL with suggesting that pro football is injurious to the, the--you know, it's just not safe for the players, I mean by the very nature.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I just recently had my yearly physical examination.  I think everybody should have a yearly physical examination, so I went through with my doctor and I still haven't--from almost thirty years ago, he's still my doctor.  So, we finished the physical, and he asked, you know, "Everything is good?  Is anything else going on?"  I said, "Nope, everything is good."  And, you know, I'm like trying to get out the door and he said, "Are you sure?"  I said, "Well, you know, I've been having blurred vision and headaches," and I started rattling off all of these symptoms that I was feeling.  So, he said, "Maybe we should have you see a specialist."  I said, okay.  And so I went to see a specialist by the name of Dr. Ken Kutner [Kenneth Kutner], went through two days of testing, and the diagnosis came back as mild post-concussion syndrome.  Had it not been for my doctor at my yearly physical asking, are you sure, I probably would not have been diagnosed.  And so when Dr. Kutner gave me that information, it gave me an understanding of what I was dealing with, and I started putting all of this stuff together, the suicide attempt, or the thoughts of suicide, the inability to use the words that I wanted to use or lose my train of thought, and on and on, the depression that I felt during the course of even the season.  And so I had something to really understand what I was sort of dealing with.  And I'm smart enough to understand that if I hurt my knee, there are probably a thousand other players who probably have hurt their knee, similar situations.  If I hurt my elbow, there are probably five hundred other guys who have hurt their elbow.  If I hurt my brain, there's probably a hundred other or a thousand other guys who have hurt their brains 'cause we've gone through like experiences.  And so when I look at all of these guys who have--were exhibiting behavior that nobody really picked up on, but Mike Webster, I was very much aware of what he was going through when he was arrested for forging prescriptions for drugs.  Mike Webster was not that kind of guy.  And so I knew, there's something going on here.  And then he was living in a bus station, living out of his car, and all of this stuff was going on, and so when he passed away, I went to his funeral.  I was the only non-Steeler who went to his funeral.  And I asked his son [Garrett Webster], "What was going on with your dad?"  And he told me what was going on.  And so I just understood it--or it gave me a clearer understanding of what we were dealing with and we never knew it.
Story_ID: 519546
Speaker 1: There are players who I played with and against who laughed when I started talking about the issue of post-concussion syndrome.  Those players now--as time has gone by, those--many of those same players are dealing with neurological issues that they don't really know anything about.  They may or may not have been diagnosed, but I can look at them and tell exactly what's going on with them because I've lived with it.  The great thing about me getting my education is I was trained to be an educator, but I played football, but I've studied myself.  I've studied the things that I've gone through, but I've also been aware of everything that's gone on around me with players and so forth, so I'm sort of up to speed with the situation that a lot of other people are not.  And when I see players committing suicide, I understand that they are sacrificing themselves because they know that there's something going on and they don't know quite what or how to handle it.  A Junior Seau is a player who was dealing with emotional pain and his mind was not quite the same as it was before.  He had--if someone had told him you have post-concussion syndrome and it's something you can live with, you just have to learn how to manage it, he probably would still be here.  But these guys, they have not gotten the care, they have not gotten the diagnosis that they made--or should've gotten, and the NFL [National Football League] has done things to try to stem the tide of these issues.
Speaker 2: I know when Dave Duerson [HistoryMaker David R. Duerson], who won that second Super Bowl with the Giants [New York Giants], who had been safety with the Bears [Chicago Bears], when Duerson--we interviewed him.  He was a HistoryMaker in 2011 [sic.]; we talked to him.  He talked about the '85 [1985] Bears.  He told great stories and everything, was very sharp, was a businessman, a family man, and two years later, he committed suicide 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, he did have some--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --business problems.  I think he had like a sausage company [Duerson Foods, Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin] or something like that.  He had some--he had some issues with that, but he also had some issues--some marital issues.  And I think any time you deal with former players and you're talking about marital issues, you're talking about mood swing issues--Thurman Thomas, who played in Super Bowl XXV, came out with and apologized to his family for what he has put them through in regards to his mood swings, and it takes a lot for a guy to admit it and come out and talk about it, I saw him, you know, recently, and I praised him because it's not something that a lot of guys want to own up to, but he knows that he has hurt his family because of what he's been sort of dealing with.  You know, there are a lot of former players who are dealing with these, these issues, so when you talk about Mike Webster, talk about Terry Long, you talk about the other defensive line--offensive lineman from Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh Steelers] who was driving the car in the wrong direction, you talk about Ray Easterling, who sent me a letter a couple of months prior to him committing suicide, and then you look at Dave Duerson, and then, you know, Junior Seau.  All of these guys are guys who went through with the ultimate thing of committing suicide, and there are so many more who I know, who have contacted me directly.  And, you know, I've talked some of my teammates off the ledge because, you know, I had one who was this close to committing suicide, and had it not been for us talking, he probably would be dead now.  And so, you know, my stance on this whole things is--you know, I'm conflicted because I played the game and I enjoyed playing the game.  I never loved football, but I loved being with the guys who I played with.  And now, I love advocating on behalf of those guys because many of those guys don't have a voice.
Story_ID: 519547
Speaker 1: Well, what about the NFL Players Association [National Football League Players Association]?  I think there was one video I saw you were kind of critical of what they--the role they played in this concussion issue.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, the NFLPA, when Gene Upshaw was there, any time you complained, Gene would be like that parent who--like that evil stepparent who would, you know, like kind of stick it to you for even acknowledging that you're in pain.  And the players that he was representing were not being represented properly.  And, you know, I sort of made it known that--and I used my hall of fame induction speech to shine a light on the issues of retired players, and I was very much serious in that if you're gonna roll players out every year and say that, you know, this is the best of the NFL [National Football League] and then turn around and not do anything for them, then you're being disingenuous, and you're using these guys for your own means, and I implored them to do a better job of taking care of all of the players.  And, you know, all of these players are different, they live different lives, and they're dealing with dealing with different ailments, and you're dealing with egos, you're dealing with guys who just don't know what's going on inside of them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think that--
Speaker 2: So, I'll go one step further.  While the concussion issue is more closely related to football and it's football on all levels, even from Pop Warner to high school, college, and the NFL, it is not just a football problem.  It is a problem with all contact sports, whether it's auto racing, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., sustains a concussion in an accident in 2012 or something like that.  He hides the fact that he sustained a concussion from his sponsors, fear that they're going to pull his sponsorship, their sponsorship of him.  You look at players who play ice hockey and they get, you know, crosschecked or whatever and, you know, a lot of those guys are dealing with neurological issues, guys who are wrestlers, boxers, you know, any sport that is a contact sport, you should be prepared to understand that if trauma to the head and the brain occurs, then it's no different than football.  Football, you have so many more hits that, you know, players take.  Whether it's in practice or in games, there's so many more hits that they take.  And it's not about the equipment because with the brain, the brain is inside the skull, and this fluid that separates the brain from the inside of the skull, and if you get hit or if, you know, you stop very, very quickly, that brain is gonna hit against the inside of the skull.  It's gonna tear--you know, you're gonna have damage, bruises, whatever, and at some point down the line, you know it's gonna manifest itself in a way that might not necessarily be good for those--for the individual who sustains the head trauma.
Story_ID: 519548
Speaker 1: I know you said in the hall of fame speech, I think it was Deacon Jones' luncheon speech for the 2006 hall of fame class [for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Canton, Ohio].  He's--he was talking about how great football was and he would do it all over again, and you, you came up and you said that you wouldn't do it.
Speaker 2: I--you know, I started to because, you know, I hear all these guys and they're like--you know, and they're emphatic about it.  Oh, you know, the game is great, game is great and I'd--you know, whatever I had to do I'd do it all over again, and almost fell into that routine of mimicking them, and I said to myself, you got to be nuts.  You got to be crazy to say that you'd do it all over again.  And then I just started telling the truth, no, if I had to do it all over again, I would not.  You know, everybody is entitled to their opinion, and I know that there are guys who are very much in love with the game, but as I stated earlier, I fell into football not because I loved it; the reason why I played is because of girls.  And once I got the hang of it, you know, I became good enough to take my skills, like LeBron James and, you know, they talk about taking their skills, take it to the next level and I took it to the next level.  And, you know, the leadership that I've acquired as a result of playing the game and being with guys, I think that's the thing that helps me tremendously in advocating for, you know, the players who are now dealing with issues.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in 2013, the NFL [National Football League] agreed to a $765 million settlement with the NFL players (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seven hundred and sixty-five million dollars in their concussion lawsuit.
Speaker 1: Five thousand NFL--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --former NFL players and I think you said at the time, you--
Speaker 2: You got 765 million reasons why you don't want to play football.  I mean, it's right there for you.  If that kind of money is put in there and there's an acknowledgement regardless of who--you--there is an acknowledgement that there is a correlation that's there.  It might not be a full acknowledgement as to how much the NFL knew and when they knew it, but if you are dealing with some neurological issue, you can tap into those funds.  I don't know if it's been released yet, but now, that $765 million has a--doesn't have a cap on it, and so I really is probably more than a billion dollars that would be accessible to players who have sustained this issue.
Story_ID: 519549
Speaker 1: You've appeared in Frontline's ['Frontline'] "League of Denial" ["League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis"] "Cost of Glory" ["The Cost of Glory?: The Toll of Concussions in Football"] another documentary, and, of course, we mentioned the movie, 'Concussion' has been made with--starring Will Smith as the doctor [Bennet Omalu] that discovered this.  Do you think that we're getting ready to see the end of football (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --at some point?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  You know, I think about this every day.  You will not see the end because everybody has a price, and when you have the dollars that are being paid now in the National Football League [NFL], there're going to be many young men willing to assume the risk of a concussion.  Now, many of those young men are going to be young men of color because, you know, there are so many--especially in the South where football is really king.  You're going to have young men who will see playing football as their out.  Playing football in high school is going to give them a scholarship to college, and then when they get to college, playing football is going to get them to the NFL.  And so when they get to the NFL, you know, they think that they're going to play for an extended period of time.  But after they've had their first or second concussion, they're going to be jettisoned because then they become a medical risk.  So, I mean that's how it sort of goes, but they'll always have players willing to assume the neurological risks.  Plus, the other thing is, the NFL I think is going to be looking to go more global than just staying here in this country.  I mean, now they're drafting players from foreign countries.  You're getting more players from Nigeria.  You had a player from Germany who was drafted by Minnesota [Minnesota Vikings].  And so they're gonna be looking.  I mean, they're gonna be looking to spread their brand around the world, not that people don't know about the NFL but I think, you know, one of their games is scheduled to be played next year or the next year in China.  So, they're looking to do things worldwide.
Story_ID: 519550
Speaker 1: Sir, how do you feel about making the Pro Football Hall of Fame [Canton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: You know, when I first got word that I was elected to the hall of fame, I really didn't care because I had divorced myself of the situation.  But then my wife [Maribel Carson] kind of pulled me aside and said, "Play nice."  And so I accepted the honor with the opportunity to speak and be heard at the Pro Football Hall of Fame during the induction ceremony.  But the thing that I thought about, from the time that I was elected until the time that I was inducted, from right before Super Bowl whatever it was to the induction in August, I thought about many things, and one of the things that I--that I thought about was when I go back and examine my life, and I think about Mrs. Washington [Flora Washington], my first grade teacher, and how she and all of her teacher compatriots worked their rear ends off to prepare me and my peers for life beyond just going to school.  I think about my family.  I think about my ancestry.  I think about my ancestors, who never made it over on the ships that they were packaged on.  And I think of how God has made me an instrument to be recognized, and not just me, but my family, my family name to be recognized.  When I was being inducted, I went and I met with the sculptor of my bust and I asked him, "How long is this bust going to be around?"  And he said, "Forty thousand years," and I thought to myself, wow, forty thousand years.  And I just thought about all of those--all of my relatives who I don't know, who I am in this position as a black man representing all of my relatives with this honor.  It's a game, but I gave my all, and I share the honor with everybody who I played with.  But that's the thing that really sticks out, is that God put me in a position out of all of my relatives to do something that was so unique because there were only--at, at the taping of this, there were only a little more than three hundred members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame out of the many thousands of men who have played.  There are only a little more than three hundred, and I'm one of--I'm the 231st player to be inducted.  So for me, that's like heavy stuff and I'm very proud that I'm able to represent my family in that way.
Story_ID: 519551
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community, when you think back about Florence [South Carolina] or about New York [New York], about where we live?
Speaker 2: You know, I think that--I would hope that African American men and women have a sense of history 'cause I think that's so important.  I mentioned earlier that I take my grandkids--right now, my granddaughter [Jamison Carson-Gurley] is ten and my grandson [Kellen Carson-Gurley] is six, and I take them where I used to live, and I try to expose them to the past, and I want them to grow up understanding that they weren't born with--or I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth, that I came from poverty.  And I want them to appreciate their family, to love their family, to know that we are behind them to be the best people that they can be.  I don't want my grandson--you know, I've already gone on record and I said I don't want him playing football, but I don't want him to be the best athlete, I want him to be the best person that he can be, and to be smart, and to use his brain and not his brawn.  Whenever I speak to young men and women of color, and they're enamored with the fact that, you know, I've won all of these awards, it means absolutely nothing.  The awards that mean the most to me, my high school diploma and my college degree, and to be awarded an honorary doctorate, those are the things that mean the most to me, what's up here and not about the body and so forth.  But understanding what your history is, understanding that people paid a price to allow you to be doing what you're doing.  Every year from the time that I was eighteen, I voted and I vote because I was around when the dogs were being sicced on, you know, my ancestors, and we had to fight for the right.  And so, you know, I would hope that all young people understand that a price was paid for them to be where they are and they can't take that lightly.
Story_ID: 519552
Speaker 1: Tell us a little about--a little bit more about your family.  You're--are you--you're married now, right, and you say now you have a--not only a daughter [Aja Carson-Gurley], but you have grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I'm married, second marriage, first one didn't work out, but I have three children, two sons and one daughter, and my daughter is married.  She has two children [Jamison Carson-Gurley and Kellen Carson-Gurley].  I have a pudding and a package, so my pudding is ten and my package is six, and I'm very active with them, and very much a part of their life.  My son, Donald [Donald Carson], is a doctor.  He had a bout with aplastic anemia, which was a potential fatal condition, and we went through it, and he made a decision that he was going to go on to med school from college, and he got his master's [degree] and then went on to med school and now he's a doctor.  And then my younger son is Lucky [Lucky Carson].  He just finished a stint in the United States Marines [U.S. Marine Corps].  Currently, he is getting his architectural degree from the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  So, they are my proudest accomplishments because I was a single father.  I hate to say this, but they're from three different mothers, but when we are together, they have my personality.  And I'm proud in that I was in their lives from day one, and their mothers and I have co-parented them to them being where they are now, being so smart, well adjusted, and good people.  They are three of the best people that I know and I'm proud to say that I'm their dad.
Story_ID: 519553
Speaker 1: Well, before I ask my last question, is there anything else that I haven't asked you that you think we need to cover before I--before I ask (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I know you wanted to say--ask something about the Fritz Pollard Alliance and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in that role, I worked with John Wooten who is chairman, and it's an opportunity for John and I to advocate on behalf of minority coaches.  When I was a player, there were very few minority coaches that I saw.  We had one on the Giant [New York Giants] coaching staff and so I thought to myself, you know, I know that's not something I'm gonna be doing because, you know, they're not gonna give guys an opportunity, men of color.  And so I've seen a lot of men who have toiled for years and years and years and never got the opportunity because owners and GMs [general managers] didn't look at them in the same way because they didn't meet at the country club and all of this stuff and have conversations.  So, it was sort of a closed door for many men of color.  And so we worked very diligently to help level the playing field to give the opportunity for coaches, scouts, GMs, executives within the National Football League [NFL] to work on a level playing field.  And so, in essence, in that role, you know, I've advocated on behalf of players in regards to traumatic brain injury, but I'm also advocating on behalf of many of those within the coaching and GM and scouting roles in the National Football League, and work very closely with the NFL's diversity committee and the commissioner in terms of diversity and, you know, making things possible for those who are looking to get into the league in non-player positions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Is this the same John Wooten that was the guard for Jim Brown?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the Cleveland Browns, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, do you see any contradiction in that?  In--
Speaker 2: In what?
Speaker 1: In advocating for diversity in the NFL and regretting that you played in some ways?  I mean, if you could go back and--
Speaker 2: No.  I compartmentalize things.  I mean, when I talk about the issue of concussions, that's just me personally, you know, sharing my thoughts.  There are other people who feel very strongly about playing, and we have our disagreements, especially when it comes to kids playing, and their brains are still developing.  But in terms of working to, you know, with the Fritz Pollard Alliance, I'm advocating for those who are trying to get that leg up.  I'm not advocating that I want to play or anything, but I'm speaking on their behalf.  And so I don't see any contradiction there.  If there is, I'll compartmentalize it.  I'll say whatever I have to say, but then I'll go and work with the commissioner to, you know, balance the playing field for those who are--who want to get, you know, higher in the--in coaching and being a GM or a scout.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I read that you discussed with Romeo Crennel at one time the possibility of coaching yourself and you decided not to do it.
Speaker 2: Well, Romeo and Lenny, Lenny Fontes [Len Fontes], you know, we were sort of talking one day and I asked him, "So what time do you get here in the morning?"  We were in the meeting room.  And they said, "We get here about 7, you know, 6:30, 7."  And I said, "Well, what time do you leave?"  "10, 10:30."  I said, "When do you get to see your kids?"  They said, "Well, that's hard, maybe on a Saturday prior to a home game."  And I thought to myself, I don't wanna live that life, and that's one of the reasons why I never really wanted to go into coaching.  They don't have a life.  And I'm so fortunate in that I've been able to be in my children's lives.  I remember meeting Jill Parcells prior to Super Bowl whatever, when the Cowboys [Dallas Cowboys] were playing the Buffalo Bills, and I asked her, I said, "Jill, how was it growing up with your dad [Bill Parcells]?"  And she said, "I never knew him.  He was never at home."  And I felt sad because, you know, when you're a coach at that level, you put everything into it, and I can understand how your kids miss you, but you have more important things to do, but what's more important than your child?  And when they grow up, when they say something like I never knew him because he was never at home, and then the case of Parcells, you know, married for forty years and then he divorces and, you know, what did that wife [Judith Goss] have to go through, forty years of being alone and, you know, I just can't see myself giving myself to the game in that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, in--you know, I know football, I know the culture of football, and it's my way of giving back to help those who are looking to get ahead.
Story_ID: 519554
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the last question.  This is the last one.  Sir, what today do you consider to be your legacy?  And the second part of it is, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy is speaking up for what I know is real and drawing attention to something that I know is real.  I get people who hate me for even talking about it because they feel like I'm declaring a war on football.  I'm not.  I'm trying to enlighten people and give them information that I never got, or players like me.  We never got the information.  And so it gives parents a better understanding of what they should consider in allowing their kids to play.  I'm not saying don't let your kid play, but you should consider this in making a determination as to whether you're going to allow your kid to play.  But, you can't say, I'm gonna let my kid play, and then when he's damaged in some way, then come back and say, well, I didn't know.  Well, I'm talking about it.  If you're gonna ignore it, then fine.  You're--you can ignore it.  But how I would like to be remembered is, I'm a man who loves my family, I love my kids, and for me, it--it's all about just doing the right thing, and being a person who has made a difference in the lives of other people.  I think that really is how I would like to be remembered.  It's very interesting that, you know, we have this conversation.  There is so much that I could tell you about the things that I've done.  At this point in my life, well away from football, what I find is people who were big Giants [New York Giants] fans 25, 30, 40 years ago who watched me play, many of those people have passed away or are in the process of passing away, and then their children contact me when their parents are terminal or about to transition, and they ask me to come and visit with their parent or their grandparent because they were introduced to football through their parent or grandparent, their father or mother.  And to sit at the bedside of someone that you don't know, but they are a Giant fan and their pleasurable moments were talking football or going to a game with their son, and now they're about to transition, and I'm there, I've made a difference in the life of that person.  Ironically, I'm getting emails from young people who I've touched in some way that have influenced them to become better people and they have thanked me for taking a minute to say something nice to them, and by saying something nice to them and believing in them, it has influenced them.  So, I know what just taking two minutes to encourage someone can do.  It can turn a life around.  And so I think that I've made a difference in the lives of some young people.  I know I've made a difference in the lives of my kids, just being there and not running to be a coach somewhere and missing out on different things.  Yeah.  That's my story and I'm sort of sticking to it.
Speaker 1: You wrote your book, 'Captain for Life' ['Captain for Life: My Story as a Hall of Fame Linebacker,' Harry Carson] in 2011, I believe it is?  And it's a testament to everything we've been talking about today.  It's a good book.  Thank you so, so much, sir.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  My pleasure.
