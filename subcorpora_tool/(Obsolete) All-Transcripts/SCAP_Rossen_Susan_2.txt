AMANNA:	So this is Ellice Amanna and this is the second half of our interview with Susan Friebert Rossen, the first half of which is recorded on the Smith camera.  Okay. So we're back, Susan.
ROSSEN:	Okay.
AMANNA:	So we've been talking about your career after Smith.
ROSSEN:	Yes.
AMANNA:	And let's just reflect a little, if you will, on your Smith experience.  It sounds like you feel like you were prepared here for a –
ROSSEN:	I was, I was.  I was prepared here for my career, no question about it.  And I –
AMANNA:	Does that include your writing?  Because you got into publishing.  Is this where you picked up your writing skills?
ROSSEN:	Well, I was writing in high school, but it was much more rigorous here.  It was much more of a – there was much more good critical thinking going on in class, and one was carefully – one's work was carefully looked at.  In high school, I signed my name and I got an A.  All I had to do was sign my name, which was not a good thing for me.  So when I came to Smith and I signed my name and I didn't get A's, I was really stunned and, of course, really shaken, deeply shaken.  And that's what I want to mention.  So I came on scholarship.  My father was an art professor, where he earned practically nothing at a state university in Wisconsin.  So I got this really nice scholarship.
I came here and I found myself living in Northrop House on the fifth floor.  I don't know if you even know that there's a fifth floor in Northrop House.  That's the attic.  And there were five of us up there.  I had been corrected.  I thought it was the fourth floor and there were four of us up there, but I found out yesterday that it was the fifth floor and there were five of us there.  And they were little, tiny rooms, no bigger than like this.  Okay.  And no bathroom up there at all.  Under the eaves, it was stifling hot, in the summers and the spring and the fall, and it was freezing in the winter.  And no one came to visit us up there, because it was so far up.  And I discovered that we were all scholarship students.  And I didn't discover that until I read a book by a woman who graduated, I think, in class of '60 or '61, named Susan Allen Toth,   T-O-T-H.   And she wrote a book about life at Smith in her years, a memoir.  And I read that book, and I realized that she was talking about me, when she said that, as a scholarship student, she was given a lesser room.  And also they didn't want to mix you with non-scholarship people.  Okay.  And it turns out there was one woman on our floor, who I'd forgotten about, and she wasn't a scholarship.  She was the fifth one.  She had gotten into Smith so late and had said yes so late, that she didn't have another choice but to be up there.  So we loved each other.  It wasn't like we didn't have a great time, and we bonded, but there was a division between the privileged and the less privileged in 1959, '60.  And that's the only time I really ever felt it, you know.  And I did feel there was something, but I couldn't say what it was.
The other thing that happened is, at one point, I was so miserable up there, because of the heat, that I asked to be switched.  And I hadn't formed the friendships that I eventually did.  So what they did is they introduced me to a woman, and I would have to share a room.  It was a double.  And she was Jewish, as was I, and she was a scholarship student.  So they weren't going to even mix us with Christians.  I mean, it was – there were some Christian scholarships on the fifth floor of Northrop, but that was okay, because we were over there.  These kinds of things were operating, and I was stunned to learn about them later.  I mean, I –
AMANNA:	Was there a Hillel then?
ROSSEN:	Yes, there was, there was.
AMANNA:	So there was a sense of Jewish life?
ROSSEN:	There was a sense of Jewish life, which I had never – and I was more aware of being Jewish when I came to Smith than I ever was at a high school that wasn't very Jewish, I mean, but I still felt – and it wasn't a practice – I was a very secular Jew.  And there were many, many young Jewish women in my class who were brilliant who came from really good schools in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, public schools as well as private schools.  So they didn't, I don't think, feel what I felt as a kind of double whammy.
AMANNA:	Class.
ROSSEN:	Right.  And, of course, in our class, there were only four women of color.  And I have to tell you, I didn't know one.  I never got to know one of them.  One of them is with us at this reunion.  She is from India.  The other two or three didn't even respond to any of our requests to go into our reunion book.  That's how distanced, I imagine, they felt.  I can't even imagine how they felt, in 1959, to be in this school.  One of them was the daughter of an ambassador to the UN.  So, you know, I mean, one of them came from Switzerland, one of them came from New York.  I mean, I've learned this since about them, because I've been so curious.  But it's wonderful to see how Smith has changed.  I mean, it is a really great thing to hear about the diversity and to see it, actually, as I have been seeing it since I've been visiting.
AMANNA:	And it was an interesting political time, just thinking about civil rights and –
ROSSEN:	Well, yes.  I mean, there were sit-ins at the Woolworth's, which I didn't, of course, being that I only studied all the time.  I was completely – although my politics are leftist, they weren't that – and I was always a leftist, and I came out of a socialist city, a socialist family, a union, you know, family.  And I knew that my politics were, at that point in time, shared by other Jewish liberals who were around, but I wasn't very political.  But my friends were in those Woolworth sit-ins and –
AMANNA:	So you were aware, in real time, that –
ROSSEN:	I must have been, but you know how I became aware again, when I read the **Suffiance this last summer, for this book.  We did the reunion book.  And I was here last summer for almost five days, four days, reading in there.  And that's when I saw the letters and learned about the sit-ins, and some of my friends did that, because their names are mentioned or they wrote letters, you know.  Also interesting, if you read in our reunion book, there's a really interesting survey that was done anonymously.  We all fed answers to anonymous questions.  And one of our classmates is very good at this, and she put it together and did a report, which is printed in this book.  And it will tell you that, when we were at Smith, we were, I don't know, 60, 65 percent Republican.  I wasn't, but, you know.  Right.  And Kennedy/Nixon, we did a straw vote, and I think actually Nixon almost won.  I mean, sort of shocking when you think about it.  And today, the class, at least the ones that answered that survey, it's over 90 percent either Democrat or left of Democrat, which is really an interesting shift, isn't it?
AMANNA:	It is.
ROSSEN:	And I just think it has to do with the level of education they got.  One woman writes about how she had never met a Democrat until she had a roommate, and her parents were furious that she was given this roommate who came from a different political background.  And she said she'd never met one until she got – and, of course, she became an active liberal and Democrat.  So, you know, those are nice things to read and to think about.
AMANNA:	Yeah, yeah.
ROSSEN:	So that's – are we at the end of our 15 minutes, probably?
AMANNA:	We're getting there.
ROSSEN:	Okay.  We're getting there.  Do you have other things you want me to mention?  Let's see.
AMANNA:	Well, if you have memories that are –
ROSSEN:	Yeah.
AMANNA:	Is it part of your identity or is it a growing part of your identity that you are a Smithie?  How do you think about that?
ROSSEN:	Well, I am so grateful for the things that it gave me.  Even though, in the end of my freshman year, I had done not well enough, so I lost my scholarship, which was again, a great – you know, which made me study even harder.  And I had to take out loans and that kind of thing in order to get through.  But it gave me this great education.  It gave me the career that I really am proud of.  It gave me a junior year Europe which I wouldn't have had easily on my own.  And it gave me extraordinary friendships, which I have until this day, and some of them are here with me at this event.  And then I had this experience teaching in this museum program that they had in the summer, which also I felt was giving back a bit, you know, as well as getting.  And I'm giving a work by my father, who was a major artist, and a big fish in a small pond, the small pond being Wisconsin.
AMANNA:	Was he a painter?
ROSSEN:	He was a painter.
AMANNA:	What was his name?
ROSSEN:	His name was Joseph Friebert.  He was a painter, teacher at the University until his retirement.  And he painted 'til the day he died, and he was 94 when he died.  And I've just have promised a gift to the museum, because they don't have a lot of good social realist material that's from the 20s and 30s and 40s and in that era.  So they're going to take a painting, I think.
AMANNA:	You're hoping?
ROSSEN:	I'm hoping.  I think they will.  And so I met yesterday with Linda Muehlig who is the curator there, and I've been talking to her about this for four years, but we're going to do it now.  And the other thing I'm going to do, Martin Antonetti, whom you know, was the Mortimer Rare Book Library.  I have a collection that I built, again, inspired by Leonard Baskin, who was an artist in the art department, whom I never really knew, but it was his art that interests me, and by Elliot Offner, who was the mentor I mentioned to you.  And I began to collect illustrated books from that social realist period, books and wood cuts and wood engravings, black and white, for adults.  And I now have a collection of almost a thousand of these books, and they are coming here.
AMANNA:	Oh, wonderful.
ROSSEN:	And I'm doing that because it just seems to sum up what I got, you know.
AMANNA:	Yeah.
ROSSEN:	And it will clear out my apartment.  So my daughter won't have to worry about that, too.  So, you know, I guess I'm more and more identified.  And doing the editing of the reunion book was also a way for me to really get into what this class – who they are now.  And that was very moving.
AMANNA:	Yeah.
ROSSEN:	So, yeah, I feel very privileged.
AMANNA:	Well, thank you.  Thank you for giving back in the way you have, and thank you for sitting with us.
ROSSEN:	You're welcome.
AMANNA:	It was a pleasure.
ROSSEN:	You're welcome.  I wanted to do that.
AMANNA:	Thank you.
