Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five light-weight questions that we ask as a warmup, so, they just require short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Uh--I probably have several favorite foods; ice cream, all kinds of vegetables.  Do you want me to be more specific than that?

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Hmmm.  I don't know, I'm running a blank.  I probably have a few.  I'm not thinking of, of it right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 106424
Speaker 1: Well, now, give us the names of your parents and tell us a little bit about them.
Speaker 2: My father's name was Benjamin Franklin Waters, "B.F. Waters," he always signed his name, and he was from Upper Hill, Maryland, on the, obviously, the east coast near the, not far from the Chesapeake [Bay].
Speaker 1: And, about what year was he born in?
Speaker 2: He was born, I think, in 1896.
Speaker 1: And, your mother?
Speaker 2: She was from a place called Onancock, Virginia, also near the Chesapeake.  My mother's name was--is--Britannia Rachel Waters, maiden name, Hall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do your parents do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father was a social worker.  He worked with, he was director of a recreation center, Lincoln Recreation Center [New York City, New York].  I think it was on 113 Street between 7th and 8th Avenue and he, in the summers, he was director of several boys' camps for the Boys Athletic League and his second career he became a gardener for the city, for all the public housing.  He did garden, planting of their grounds and my mother, basically, she was a homemaker and a hairdresser.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She got her hairdressing certificate at the Apex School of Beauty, which was on 135th Street and 7th Avenue, which is now the Thurgood Marshall School [sic, Thurgood Marshall Academy for Learning and Social Change]. It used to be over Smalls Paradise.
Story_ID: 106425
Speaker 1: Now, did you grow up in Harlem [New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay. Whereabouts?
Speaker 2: On 148th Street between Amsterdam and Convent, Avenues, 465.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Okay.  So what was it like growing up in Harlem in the, uh-- You grew up in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: It seemed a pretty regular life to me.  I did what most kids did.  I went to school.  I took piano lessons.  I was very active, I was very active--, you know, we played in the street a lot of that time, jump rope, Double Dutch, stickball, most of the guys played stickball or stoop ball, but a lot of times us girls participated in those sports and we went to the city pools, you know, in the summer.  I went to an elementary school which I could walk, it was three blocks away, P.S. 186; and then, Stitt Junior High School, P.S. 164 [sic, I.S. 164 Edward W. Stitt School].  It was at 164th and Edgecombe Avenue.  So my activities were pretty, you know, you went ice-skating, you went roller-skating, you played games in the street.  I belonged to the PAL, Police Athletic League, so I ran track.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (simultaneous) What events did you run?
Speaker 2: Hmmm???
Speaker 1: What events did you run?
Speaker 2: Oh, dash, relay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was very active.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were athletic.
Speaker 2: I was very athletic and--
Speaker 1: Did your father's [Benjamin Franklin Waters] positions in the recreation department, you know, encourage you or provide, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to camp every summer.  I went to the girls camps that were part of the organization that he worked with and so I was, you know, very involved in whatever camp activities there were there, swimming, etc.
Story_ID: 106426
Speaker 1: And immediately after two or three weeks at camp, I was sent off to [Onancock] Virginia, (laughter) to stay with my grandmother for the rest of the summer, my grandmother [Minnie Matilda Marshal-Hall] and grandfather [Mathew-James Hall], which I now consider one of the most valuable experiences I had up until the age of twelve.
Speaker 2: Okay.  How so?
Speaker 1: Well, living in the country, I lived in the home where my mother [Britannia Rachel Waters] was born and where she grew up, one of eight children, and my grandmother, she had a very regimented day for me.  I was up, what I thought was the crack of dawn, 7 a.m., and the reason for that was because it got so hot during the day, and very often she had chores for me to do, like getting wood because she had a wood-burning stove, pumping water, you know all of those things that are just foreign to a kid now.  She sent me on errands ten times a day.  I was always barefoot.  I always stubbed my toes.  She took me berry picking, potato picking, tomato picking, and they had a small farm, so that kind of rural existence was, at the time it wasn't fun.  At the time I didn't quite appreciate it, and I used to say to her, "Why are you getting me up so early?  I'm on vacation."  You know.  She saw that I had piano lessons.  She saw that I had a nap every day, and she saw that I went to Sunday school every Sun-every Sunday.  So, it was a very regimented life in a way, and, but what I used to love was to watch her cook; you know, to watch her make biscuits, to watch her, how she could, one of the things that really fascinated me, it sounds pretty horrible, I would sit on the back step every Sunday and she would take one of the chickens from the coop and she would, you know, take an axe, cut off their head and let it fly and I was, that was the most fascinating thing to me, to see a chicken continually moving without its head, you know, when it should have been pronounced dead.  I just, I didn't get it, you know, and then it finally calmed down and she would pour the hot water over it and could pluck feathers and-- faster than anyone I had ever seen, and cut it up, clean it, and the next thing I knew it was on the table ready to eat and it was just, it was beautiful, and I watched the whole process and I watched her--  She had this big flour barrel, you know, where they had maybe six months' worth of flour in there to make bread and biscuits.  I watched her lighting the stove.  All of those things were basic but very exciting to me; I mean, it was an education for me and it was also down that I ironically learned more about jazz music because my uncle had a collection of jazz records, Dizzy Gillespie and all the bee-bop records and what-- and so, during my nap time, I would play those records on the Victrola and then I'd just get up and dance, and I remember "[A] Night in Tunisia" especially.  And my grandmother, though, she was hearing impaired.  She felt the vibrations.  She knew I should have been, you know, taking my nap and I wasn't, so.
Speaker 2: That sounds like a really rich time in Virginia.
Speaker 1: It was a very rich time on the eastern shore, you know, and I wasn't, at that time, as aware of segregation as I did, as I had become later on.  You know, I was always with my grandmother and grandfather so I knew where to go, you know, and he, after giving up his steel mill shop and wood working shop because he got a piece of steel in his eye, so he gave that business up and he bought race horses, trotters, so I was always at the race track as well and she would take him his lunch and we'd just thumb a ride, you know, to go up to the fair ground where they had the race track and the race horses, AND we were back and forth doing that.  So, I had many activities, and of course I had friends.  I had kids to play with.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 106427
Speaker 1: Now, did your parents [Benjamin Franklin Waters and Britannia Rachel Waters] go to college or was there a tradition of going to (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: My father did.  My father, actually, was a charter member of Princess Anne Academy [sic, Princess Anne Academy opened in 1886, before her father was born], which later on became University of Maryland at Princess Anne [sic, University of Maryland Eastern Shore in Princess Anne, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother, uh, no.  She graduated high school and, actually she finished high school in New York [New York City, New York].  I think it was the Wadleigh School [Wadleigh High School for Girls, now Wadleigh Secondary School for the Performing and Visual Arts].
Speaker 1: Princess Anne Academy, I never heard of that.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And your mother finished high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: I think his sister introduced them; his younger sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I seem to remember.
Speaker 1: Did they meet in New York?
Speaker 2: They met in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 106428
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I'm an only child.  I mean, they were both from huge families, eight and ten children, and then there was me.  But, I have lots of cousins, so very often some of those cousins lived with us.  You know, we had this big extended family, and at other times I was alone but I learned how to use my time.  I never really felt lonely; you know, I had a pretty active, busy life.
Speaker 1: What were your aspirations as a young person?  What did you want to be?
Speaker 2: I'm sure that changed from week to week, you know.  I didn't want to be a pianist, even though I was taking piano and I loved music, and there was always music in the house, but I didn't have a piano so it didn't make sense to me.  You know, I had to practice at my music teacher's house, who wasn't far away, and I hated practicing at her house because she could hear every mistake I made.  I wasn't, I was never at ease, you know, but she was a great teacher and she would gather her students together on Saturday mornings for a theory class, a music theory class, which seemed very grueling and tedious at the time, but I did it and then she moved away.  She moved to Long Island, but I remember she would take us to the sunrise service at Radio City [Music Hall in New York City, New York] every Christmas, and that was a big outing.  We had to be at her house, like, at the crack of dawn to go for that first show and that was always fun.  So, she was very --
Speaker 1: Was that your first exposure to live theater?
Speaker 2: I think it was, yes.  It was.
Speaker 1: And were you impressed by the Rockettes at all?
Speaker 2: I was impressed by it all, the all, the whole production aspect of it, absolutely.  Actually, that was why I had wanted to become a Catholic at that time (laughter) because of the whole production, you know.  I went with a girlfriend to a convent.  Convent Avenue literally did have convents at one time and I went with a schoolmate, uh, for some reason she had to visit the nun there and the first thing they do is put a confirmation veil on you and you go in and pray, and then you talk to the nun.  I liked that whole idea, that whole ceremony, you know, the pageantry of it, and I told my mother [Britannia Rachel Waters] when I went home, I said, "I think I want to be a Catholic."  This is fourth grade and she said, "Well, I think maybe why don'cha think about it a little bit."  But the whole idea appealed to me.  Also--
Speaker 1: What church did you go to normally (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I guess, when I was in Virginia, down on the eastern shore, we would go to a Methodist Church, Sunday school.  And, in the evenings, we'd go to the Baptist Church for a vespers service, because my grandmother [Minnie Matilda Marshal-Hall], being hearing impaired, she could hear them.  They were a little louder than the Methodists.  In New York, I finally joined the Episcopalian Church, which was very much like the Catholic Church, except it was in English.  It had just about as much pageantry and, so.
Story_ID: 106429
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I just wanted to know that.  And--okay, so did you, you were an athletic young lady growing up and--
Speaker 2: And I was a good student.  I loved school.  I was a very good student.  And, it seemed as though I might have an academic career, but in junior high school [I.S. 164 Edward W. Stitt School in New York City, New York], when I started junior high at age eleven, our gym teacher, she was a very tough disciplinarian, you know we had to wear these gym suits, and we had gym, I think, maybe three times a week and she-- we had to undress and dress in, like, two minutes.  And we had these little bags that we sewed to our gym suit that had taps in it, so she would give us, teach us time steps.  Now, the fascinating thing about Miss Mizelle [ph.] was that she always wore a suit and high heels.  She never dressed in gym clothes (laughter) and she would teach us these time steps in her high heels.  It took me years to figure out that at one time, she had been what was called a "hoofer."  She had been a dancer.  So, I learned those time steps and she also started, which was a new initiative in the public school system, an after school modern dance class.  So, I was in that, the modern dance club, rather, and it was very creative time, you could make up your own dances, bring your own music, and, you know, we made little performances.  And that began to take the place of the sports because in New York high schools, at least in my junior high, they really, we didn't do that much in terms of sports.  There was sports equipment there but we weren't using it.  That was more focused on the boys and if it weren't for the PAL [Police Athletic League], I might not have, you know, gotten any kind of track experience.  I mean, we did a little bit, but, but the dance, and I had friends who were dancers and who used to show me the exercises and what not, in their little rooms, and I'd say, "Oh, this really hurts."  And I had one friend and she said, "You've got to come to the new dance group, you've just got to."  Okay, I said, "one day, I'll come, I'll come."  And, I think another epiphany I had was watching a schoolmate, Cynthia Raglan [ph.].  She was an actress and she was auditioning for the High School of Performing Arts, which I had never heard of.  And, she was going there in the ninth grade, so she asked me to listen to her monologue.  I didn't even know what a monologue was.  I had never seen a Broadway show at that point.  And, I listened and I watched, and she totally and completely transformed herself.  She became, in that moment, the person she was portraying.  And, I was just captivated by that.  And then, when she finished, she was Cynthia again.  I said, "My gosh, how did you do that?"  And, she was accepted into the High School of Performing Arts.  And another kid who sat behind me, he, from grade school, from first grade all the way up through eighth grade, for some reason he always sat behind me, William Mashburn [ph.], and he was always banging these rhythms on his, on the desk.  Well, he was accepted into the High School of Performing Arts, as a percussion major.
Story_ID: 106430
Speaker 1: And I was slated to go to Bronx High School of Science [New York City, New York], which was fine.  I loved math, but instead I went to Evander Childs High School [now the Evander Childs Educational Campus].  I was wait-listed for Bronx Science, and there they had a program where, in lieu of gym, you could take modern dance and I was over there in a flash.  It meant that you had a dance class every day in dance clothes, with a dance teacher, and this dance teacher, Ms. Newman, she would bring books in and she would show us pictures of famous dancers, modern dancers, ballet dancers, white dancers, black dancers, I mean, and she said to me, she says, "I get the feeling that this is something you really like to do."  I said, "I do, I feel different when I do this."  So, myself and two other school mates, we went down to the new dance group one day after school and, uh, registered for class.  And, that's how it started--formally.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, um, this is at Evander Childs High School?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that's in--
Speaker 1: In the Bronx--Gun Hill Rd.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Red Buttons graduated from there, if anybody remembers him. (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, I remember Red Buttons, good, okay, Red Buttons, right.  He had his own show at one time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, now, did you, did you see yourself at that time, like on a trajectory to become a professional dancer, or did you know anything about--
Speaker 1: Well, I was smitten.  I was.  I started and I paid for it with my allowance and I started with one class a week, and then by the spring I was taking, I think, three classes a week after school and on Saturday, and then I got a scholarship that summer and I was taking dance every day, sometimes two classes a day.  So, I was just really totally immersed, and it was, I guess, at a point where I really, it was something that identified me, you know.  It's-- you don't choose it, it chooses you.  I continued to take dance in school, but after school I was down at the New Dance Group studio every day, and in those classes were students that were attending the High School of Performing Arts dance department, so I felt really in good company and I began to take more and more related courses, like they had a, they offered a composition course and I became part of their young concert dancers at the New Dance Group, and I was going to see a lot of live performances at this time--
Story_ID: 106431
Speaker 1: --It was at this time I saw and met Alvin Ailey, when I was in high school [Evander Childs High School, now the Evander Childs Educational Campus, in New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: About how old were you then?
Speaker 1: When I first saw Alvin, I guess I was about fifteen.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And-
Speaker 2: This was 1955 or so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, '54 [1954] and I think he was doing "House of Flowers."
Speaker 2: That's a Broadway play.
Speaker 1: Umm-hmm, by Truman Capote.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And people like [HM] Louis Johnson was in it, [HM] Geoffrey Holder, [HM] Carmen de Lavallade, and Alvin [Ailey] were brought especially from California to star in that show.  But, I just saw him walking down the street, on 57th Street.  I was with this same girlfriend, Anne, who had turned me on to the New Dance Group, and we were walking west and he was walking east, and he was one of the most handsome people I had ever seen, and in New York, you know, it is very unusual, people speak to each other on the street, and so he smiled and we smiled back, and he said "Hi" and we said "Hi" and we were just full of giggles as we passed, and we dared to turn around and he turned around, well oh my goodness!  That was it!  I had no idea who he was, you know, and maybe two weeks after that, I was sitting, waiting for my class one afternoon at the New Dance Group, and in he walked.  Well, I almost fainted.  And he said, "Hi!" like he knew me, like he actually remembered me, and he happened to be my substitute teacher for that day, substituting for Charlie Blackwell, so that was my first meeting with Alvin Ailey.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is before he formed the company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] and everything?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, he was a substitute dance teacher and--
Speaker 1: Well, he was just substituting that day.  He did have regular classes, but I wasn't in--and I also saw him perform in a concert at Hunter College [New York City, New York] with the company of [HM] Donald McKayle, and I saw him do works like, "Games", which was a, which is a very, very wonderful historic piece of Donald McKayle's, and they did a work "They Called Her Moses," another work "Nocturne."  I saw Alvin perform, in that, along with many others and in all of those dancers, many of them ,were doing Broadway shows as well, so it was exciting, and that, again, was another defining moment, because it really helped me identify not just that I wanted to dance but exactly what I'd wanted to do in dance, what kind of dance.
Speaker 2: Now, what was Alvin Ailey like as a performer?
Speaker 1: Oh, he was wonderful, very, very masculine on stage, very, he moved like cat, you know, very smooth, very powerful.
Speaker 2: A lot of people have never seen Alvin Ailey dance.  They've heard of the company and they know that he is a good, a choreographer (simultaneous) but I don't think we have any description--
Speaker 1: There is some footage--there is some footage of him dancing.  It was very powerful.  He had a very lioness quality, lion-like quality. Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 106432
Speaker 1: So, now, you attended Juilliard [The Juilliard School in New York City, New York], right?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Now, did you get a scholarship or what?  How did it happen?
Speaker 2: Eventually, I got a scholarship, yes.  Well, being at the New Dance Group and being so totally captivated by this field, I dec-- this girlfriend of mine, she, Anne; again, she said, "You know, I'm going up to have a look at Juilliard", and I said "What's Juilliard?" She said, "Well, it's a music school, but they have a dance department."  I said, "Really?"  She said, "Why don't you come with me?"  So I did, and, again my eyes were opened to a whole other world.  In this huge studio, Room 610, were dancers taking this Martha Graham class, and, the Martha Graham technique, rather.  I don't remember who the teacher was, but what impressed me was that they were all dressed very uniformly in black, black leotards and black tights, and their hair was all pulled back in this severe bun and, and they were moving and breathing together, doing some of the most wonderful dancing I had ever seen; and, what was also impressive about the school was that you studied music, but you also had an academic program and I said, "This is for me", and I went and I got an application immediately, sent it in, and they sent me what the requirements were for the audition and I had to prepare an audition piece and, and I was just terrified, you know, and I had asked one of my teachers at the New Dance Group to help me.  Nobody had time to help me.  So, I rented this little dance studio for five dollars an hour and worked on my composition, and I went up to Juilliard the designated date for the audition and there, there were so many dancers from the High School of Performing Arts, I said, "Oh, my goodness," and that's where I first saw Dudley Williams, and I saw dancers wearing pointe shoes, and they just seemed so, so knowledgeable and sophisticated about everything that was going on, and dance, and theater, and you know.  I was in a whole other element there; so, I took the audition and part of the audition, in addition to showing my little piece, which they didn't let me finish, you know.  I did maybe two minutes of it.  They said, "Thank you."  I said, "Oh, my goodness, what does that mean?"  And then you had to follow someone, you know, that would show you movements across the floor in ballet and in modern, and I was studying both ballet and modern at that point, and then that was it.  They said, "You'll hear from us, one way or the other, thank you."
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 106433
Speaker 1: Okay, so, what was the decision of the Juilliard [The Juilliard School in New York City, New York] staff?
Speaker 2: Well, I got my letter and I was accepted, and I was elated--out of my mind elated.  It was--and my parents [Benjamin Franklin Waters and Britannia Rachel Waters] were very proud of that.  And it's interesting, my homeroom teacher, in class, when she went around asking everyone what they were gonna do upon graduation and she got to me and I said, "Well, I've been accepted at Juilliard."  She said, "Really?  For what?"  I said, "In the dance department."  She said, "Really?"  I mean, she had no idea who I was, what I did, you know, whatever, and, but she congratulated me.  There was a very good friend of mine, Bennett Robinson.  We studied a lot together and he said, "I'm very disappointed in you."  I said, "I beg your pardon, what do you mean?"  He said, "I thought you were going to apply for a school where, you know, you'd be a physics major or math major."  I said, "No, no.  I'm going to be a dance major; sorry."  And, he sounded very disappointed and--"Anyhow, what stage do you think you're going to see?"  And with that, that just, you know, encouraged me more.  I was-- I was very disappointed in him for saying it.  I didn't realize at that time how jealous he might be or what.  I didn't understand the reasons--I thought he was a friend, and that was, that's something you learn, I guess, with maturity--who your friends are and who they aren't.
Story_ID: 106434
Speaker 1: So, I went to Juilliard [The Juilliard School in New York City, New York] and it was a glorious experience.  Again, it broadened my experience and my scope of not just the dance world but the music, because you were there with, you know, singers and musicians of every stripe, every instrument you could think of as well as dancers from all over the world.  And, um, it was an intense program, but nothing seemed difficult or impossible and, I think the only thing at Juilliard, my criticism of Juilliard at that time, was there wasn't enough performance experience.  I felt, even then, that performance experience as you were growing and learning and developing was important.  That could be a wonderful tool for an evolving artist, and so I sought that experience out of Juilliard which tripled my hours and the time spent in dance; so, I was dancing from 9 in the morning until 10 at night.
Speaker 2: So, you performed with companies, or small (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Uh, yes.  Sometimes with [HM] Donald McKayle, sometimes with this woman, Hava Kohav [Beller].  She was Israeli, but she had a small company of about six or seven of us and we would do local performances.  In those days, choreographers had what they called "pickup" companies and they would invite x number of dancers to work with them, and you rehearse and rehearse and rehearse, usually for no money and at the end of that, you did a concert or two or three if you were lucky and you might receive, we used to say, a carnation and a note, or sometimes you may receive some remuneration, 10, 15, 20 dollars, whatever; but, you did it for the love of it and the experience.  I remember at one concert we did Hava, I mean, at the YMHA [Young Men's Hebrew Association].  That was the hub for modern dance in New York City [New York], and you know you had to be there and there you saw many, many great works that are now, are masterworks, you know.  And I remember after one, Martha Graham was there back stage, you know, congratulating me and that was absolutely thrilling.  And, I know many of those, Alvin Ailey was in the audience, and many notables, you know, in the dance world.
Speaker 2: So--so, you were talking about Martha Graham, who was like a legend in dance--
Speaker 1: And her company members.  I didn't have that may classes with her, but I was fortunate to have had classes with her at time, but the Juilliard faculty were comprised of dancers in her company, Mary Hinkson and Helen McGehee, Ethel Winter, Bertram Ross, mainly those, yeah; Stuart Hodes, sometimes, and then sometimes Martha would teach, and then in the summers I'd be on scholarship at the Graham School [Martha Graham School in New York City, New York], so I would take class and she would teach there.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, at this time, were you aware that Alvin Ailey had formed his own dance company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]?
Speaker 2: Well, in 1958, yes, that was the first performance and I saw the first performance.  It was "Blues Suite."  He did share that concert with another dancer, Ernest Parham, and, what I remember in particular in "Blues Suite" was "Mean Ole Frisco," a dance for five men and, I mean, "Blues Suite" underwent many incarnations, you know, until he reached the version that it is today, but in that early first version, I remember this singer, Brother John Sellers, and he was the blind man and he was walking through the crowd of dancers on the stage.  I remember Jacqueline Walcott, but more than anything I remember "Mean Ole Frisco" and these five men dancing, I-- and such power.  I had never seen men dancing like that, first of all, and "Blues Suite" also was very familiar to me; you know, all those summers in Virginia and blues music, because a lot of times you did have musicians coming through and at the juke joints down there; I mean, I wasn't supposed to be in them but sometimes my uncle took me or at the little movie house there would be gospel singers and blues singers performing and also those shows that traveled around.  There was always an Indian, a clown, and a barker selling (laughter) snake oil or something and very often they would have blues singers with them.  So, the blues was very much a part of my background, and I had a profound understanding of it, so that familiar connection was there from the beginning.
Story_ID: 106436
Speaker 1: Okay. Now I was told that the dance community at Juilliard [The Juilliard School in New York City, New York] was fairly open and people were, and that African Americans even were treated with, you know, dignity and respect for the most part.
Speaker 2: African American, I didn't--
Speaker 1: African American people were treated with dignity in the Juilliard company in those days; that's what I've heard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't feel like I was mistreated there; if I was, I wasn't aware of it, no.  I mean, the demographics were, I mean primarily Caucasian, but there were many students of color there from all over--uh--in the dance department as well as the music department as well as the voice department.  Shirley Verrett-Carter, I remember she was there, a student, and the opera singers were always so pulled-up and well-dressed, and they always seemed to have an entourage with them, you know.  Yes, they were, they were.
Story_ID: 106437
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you have any special mentors at Juilliard [The Juilliard School in New York City, New York], did you?
Speaker 2: All of my teachers in the Graham faculty, yes, and some of them I know to this day, uh, Mary Hinkson and Ethel Winter, and Helen McGehee, and I'm still in touch with them, and Mary lives in New York and I have a long history with her.  I used to housesit for her, you know, and yes, I consider her a mentor.  I always looked up to her.  I always wished I was she, you know.
Story_ID: 106438
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, what were you prospects when you graduated [from The Juilliard School in New York City, New York] in '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: Well, my dad [Benjamin Franklin Waters], (laughter) he--I didn't walk with my class, first of all.  I should have graduated in '61 [1961]; but, they had a rule there that you could only take two academic courses per semester with the dance program and I wanted to get out of Juilliard in four years rather than five years.  So, I went to summer school at City [City College of New York in New York City, New York] and Hunter [College in New York City, New York] every summer, again, which I loved the academic programs there and I wasn't treated as a dancer; I was just another student, and that was a real challenge.  Um, and I, my last year at Juilliard, what would have been my last year, I added an art history course, which was wonderful and plus it was an easy course.  I didn't consider it adding to my course load, you know, any more than anything else, and plus I had a pass for the museums and so, it was a great course, and midway through, after the first semester of that, I was called to the Registrar's Office, or the Bursar's, no the Registrar's Office; Judson Erhbar, he said, "You know, you're doing something that's quite against the rules."  I said, "And what is that?"  He said, "Well, you're carrying too many courses."  I said, "Well, I'm just about to graduate, so what does that mean?"  He said, "Well, you're going to have to drop one of those courses."  I said, "Art history?  I mean, I could pass that with my eyes closed.  Why?  Because of a rule?  You can't make the exception to the rule?  I'm going to graduate in June.  If I drop that course, you are not expecting I'm coming back to Juilliard for three credits."  He said, "Wow, that's the rule."  And, I was very bitter about that.  And, I was determined not to come back to Juilliard another year.  Also, I didn't think my parents [Benjamin Franklin Waters and Britannia Rachel Waters] could afford it and for three credits it just didn't make sense.  It just did not make sense.  So, I went to summer school and I finished the three credits.  I finished all of my other course requirements and I passed everything, but they wouldn't let me walk with my class.  So, I never went to the graduation the following year and my dad picked up my degree and he came home one day and he said, "This is for you."  I said, "What's that?"  He said, "This is your degree from Juilliard."  I said, "Oh, right, yeah."  He said, "And, you know, I was thinking, you probably should take that Civil Service Exam just in case.  I said, "Are you kidding?   After all this time I put in Juilliard?  I'm going to make my living doing this."  And I said it with such fervor and such passion, he was just speechless, but, knock on wood, I've been able to do pretty much that, make my living with this.  I mean, of course, I've done many other jobs, you know, do that.  It's called paying dues.  I mean, I would work as a waitress and as a salesperson, you know. I've sewn costumes and all kinds of things to make money, but it has paid off, it has paid off.  For the most part, I have worked in the dance world most of my professional life.
Story_ID: 106439
Speaker 1: Well, kind of summarize what you did before joining Alvin Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] in '68 [1968]; so, from '62 [1962] to '68 [1968], the six years.
Speaker 2: Well, I was auditioning like mad for Broadway shows because I did want to do that.  I had been taking voice lessons and what not.  I would come real close, but I was getting really, really discouraged because type was a factor, I guess.
Speaker 1: What were some of the shows you really were focusing on?
Speaker 2: There was one by this playwright who was from Chicago [Illinois], actually, [HM] Oscar Brown, Jr.  I can't remember the show, but you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: (unclear) "Kicks & Company?"
Speaker 2: "Kicks & Company."  I auditioned for that about five times, and each time, you know, they would keep me and keep me and keep me.  It seemed I would get really close and then I didn't, and there was another one, and you know, and the shows that were predominantly white shows, well you went but you didn't expect to get it.  And rarely, people did.  Sometimes they did, one or two.
Speaker 1: Did you know any perform--black dancers on Broadway, in Broadway shows?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I did know a few, and I auditioned for "Golden Boy."
Speaker 1: Sammy Davis, Jr?
Speaker 2: Yes, I auditioned for "Golden Boy."  I read for them, I sang for them, I danced for them (laughter), I had to go back maybe five or six times, and there was a friend who kept calling me, "Well, did you hear anything, did you--" And she just kept bugging me about it, and so I don't know, maybe I was on a short list at some point, you know, but I was just getting really discouraged, so what I did, and I had been working as a bookkeeper's assistant, and I had been taking classes and, you know, doing all kinds of things dancers do to make a living.  I had moved away from home.  I had my own apartment, and so, I went down to Bloomingdale's (laughter) and I applied for a sales position, and, because then I thought "Well maybe I better get a real job," and she looked at my application and she said, "Well, you've spent four years at Juilliard, you're a graduate and you want to work at Bloomingdale's?"  I said, "Yeah, I like selling.  I've worked at Bloomingdale's before.  I like fashion, I like that, and anyhow I have a bad back."  I just made that up on the spur of the moment.  "I don't think I'll be having a dance career."  So, I got the job and as soon as I got home I got a phone call from a friend saying, "How would you like to go to Europe making x amount of dollars a week traveling with "Black Nativity."  That was written by Langston Hughes, and it's a seven month tour."  I said, "I'll take it."  (laughter) And, that very next day I went over to rehearsal of Alvin Ailey and he said, "Sylvia, what are you doing?"  I said, "I just signed a contract for 'Black Nativity.'"  He said, "Oh.  Do you have Tacaco's [ph.] phone number?"  In other words, he needed a girl but, (laughter) you know, so, it's all right and we met up many times in Europe because the Ailey Company and "Black Nativity" had the same management and most of my friends were dancing with the Ailey Company, and I was almost heartbroken, but, you know, I just, you know.  It was more important to have a job paying, and I was excited about that.
Speaker 1: Now, who was the choreographer for "Black Nativity?"
Speaker 2: Talley Beatty, from Chicago [Illinois], and I tell you I had a great time.  It was a tremendous learning experience on that tour.  There were just two of us dancers; Morris Donaldson and myself.  He had also, I knew him from Juilliard, and the Stars of Faith, Marion Williams, who later became a Kennedy Center awardee [Kennedy Center Honors], and she had sang with Rosetta Tharpe, but she had her own group, The Stars of Faith, and those ladies were really something; and Alex Bradford and his group, and it was a phenomenal experience, a phenomenal experience, and they had two companies, one that went to Australia and one that went to Europe, so I had a great time.  But, after seven months, I really was ready to leave.
Speaker 1: So, you came back what year is this now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Well, I didn't come back.  I stayed in Europe.
Story_ID: 106440
Speaker 1: I lived in Paris [France] for three-and-a-half years.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is from what time to what time--from--?
Speaker 1: From 1965 to 1968.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you were performing--
Speaker 1: Well, while I was over there, I worked with many television artists and I toured with American companies when they came there, like the company of [HM] Donald McKayle, I toured with them, and I also worked with the company of Maurice Bejart, Ballet of the 20th Century [Ballet du XXme Siecle].  He was based in Brussels [Belgium] at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, so that's--well.
Speaker 1: And I came home in the meantime.  I visited home once for about three-and-a-half months and I worked with Walter Nicks, who was doing a [HM] Harry Belafonte special.
Speaker 2: Oh, for television?
Speaker 1: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay, were you on that special or?
Speaker 1: I don't think they kept the dance segment, but I remember meeting [Jackie] "Moms" Mabley and Redd Foxx, and all these fantastic people, you know.
Speaker 2: I remember that show.  Is that the one with [Dewey] "Pigmeat" Markham in it too, and--
Speaker 1: He may have been, he may have been.
Speaker 2: Okay. Hmmm, okay.  Did the actors and the dancers interact much in those days in terms of community stuff?  I know some of the actors (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: To some extent, to some extent.  But, you know, while I was in Europe I began to audition for film parts and so I was meeting all these directors, you know, and auditioning for them, not having yet gotten the part, but it always seemed closer and closer, like I met John Houston and that was a very intimidating experience.  It was in an office on the Champs-Elysees and this long table and there were lots of people around and he was very tall but very gracious and he said to me, "Now how do you like living in Paris?"  And I said, "I'm loving it." You know, "and I enjoy it very much."  And I can't remember whatever else he asked me.  And--
Speaker 2: He had that deep voice.  He had that deep sonorous voice--
Speaker 1: He did, and I remember he had a little patch, a little Band-Aid patch, maybe covering a shaving injury or something and I just couldn't take my eyes off of it.  I said, "I wonder if he wore that on purpose or--" you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, is he directing a film over there?
Speaker 1: He was directing a film.  The film was going to be "The Madwoman of Chaillot" with Angela Lansbury and, his name I can't remember, Sir Somebody, English actor, and I went to the casting agent; in fact, she's the one who sent me down for it, and I read for another film ["The Comedians"] with Peter Glenville, director.  It was a role where I had to a cold reading for that one with, what's his name, the husband of Elizabeth, one of the husbands of Elizabeth [Taylor]--
Speaker 2: Richard Burton?
Speaker 1: Richard Burton, right.  And the reason they liked me was because he wasn't very tall so they wanted someone not too tall, and I read for that and they liked me a lot and that's when I came to New York [New York City, New York], but I didn't get it and they did send me a telegram telling me I didn't get it, but to please keep in touch with them.  Cicely Tyson got it (laughter).  I found out later from James Earl Jones, cuz we did a production of "[The] Emperor Jones" with him in Edinborough [Scotland], at the Edinborough Festival, [Donald] Donny McKayle's company and, so, I happened to be talking to him one day and I said, "I don't know what happened.  I wonder who ever got that role.  You know, I read for it.  They seemed to like me.  It seemed I was almost going to get it and then I didn't get it.  Who got it?"  He said, "Oh, Cicely Tyson got that."  I said, "Okay, I understand.  I get it.  That's okay with me."  You know, I was a big fan of hers.
Speaker 2: Now how tall are you?  You mentioned height--
Speaker 1: 5'2".
Speaker 2: Okay. Does it matter in dance, really that you're tall or short?
Speaker 1: Not really.  It's nice to be tall, but-- but in Broadway shows, what I meant was a lot of times we would go by type, you know.  They may want, they may have wanted a certain type, so.
Story_ID: 106441
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well these days in the mid-late '60s [1960s] there are a lot of roles opening up on Broadway for black performers--
Speaker 2: Beginning to, yeah.
Speaker 1: [HM] Diahann Carroll had a show on, Leslie Uggams has something (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, Diahann Carroll, she was, I think, the only black person in that show.  You mean in the Broadway show?
Speaker 1: The "No Strings" show [1962]?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, everybody went down to audition for it, but I didn't know anybody who got it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Like I said, Leslie Uggams had one [1967's "Hallelujah, Baby!"]-- There are kind of a collegial feeling amongst the black performers in-- across disciplines--
Speaker 2: Oh, I think so, I think so.  I remember growing up; I mean, the neighborhood I lived in, I mean, Diahann Carroll lived down the street from me.  When she was doing "House of Flowers" I used her to see her going with her mother every day to the subway.  I didn't know who she was, but I knew she was somebody and Gregory Hines and [HM] Maurice Hines [Jr.], they were going with their parents [Alma Hines and Maurice Hines, Sr.] to tap lessons, and they were all dressed up and tap shoes slung across their shoulders and I would be standing on my stoop watching them go by, so you know there was always a parade of people in that neighborhood and [Joshua] Josh White, the folk singer.  He lived a couple of blocks away, and you know there just a lot of illustrious people up there.
Speaker 1: Okay. That had to be encouraging, you know, to see.
Speaker 2: Well, it was, except I didn't have a clue in how to get started until I started taking dance and then my world expanded from there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, watching those early rehearsals of "Blues Suite" because sometimes Alvin [Ailey] would rehearse at the New Dance Group, or rehearse at Michael's [Michael Descombey's] studio, you know, and so sometimes you, if you were there, you'd peek in and sit in on the rehearsal and watching those early rehearsals of "Revelations" you know, and seeing that this first performance was quite something.
Story_ID: 106442
Speaker 1: Before I get you out of Europe, though, can you tell me about, like so much has been written about black expatriates or black artists in Europe, musicians, and everybody from, you know, the movie "Round Midnight" that Clint Eastwood [sic, Bertrand Tavernier] did about the saxophone player.
Speaker 2: Well, I met a lot of people when I was there.  I remember this woman, Buttercup [Altevia "Buttercup" Edwards].  She had a club and she was living with Bud Powell, and they had a son and Buttercup was a kind of a raucous, raunchy but very kind person, you know, and a lot of servicemen would come to her club.  It was up in Montparnasse [Paris, France], and you could go there and dance and there'd be fried chicken and greens and stuff, so you'd meet a lot of Americans there and a lot of African Americans there.  There were dancers I knew there; some of them were choreographers, some of them were doing well, some of them were scrambling for work.  There were a lot of artists there, a lot of painters, a lot of writers, and, of course.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Baldwin?  James Baldwin?
Speaker 2: Briefly, yes.  He was there and I met a lot of people who were very close to him, especially.
Speaker 1: Now Richard Wright had already--he had already passed (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was before my time, yeah.  So, there were a lot of people there, Larry Rivers, and a lot of painters, just tons of folks.
Speaker 1: Chester Himes, I think, lived over there too, didn't he?
Speaker 2: But that, again, was earlier, I think.  Hubert Gentry [sic, Herbert Gentry] was there, painter, then I think he moved to Sweden or somewhere.
Speaker 1: Alberta Hunter.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Alberta Hunter.
Speaker 1: Bricktop [Ada Smith], did she have her club?
Speaker 2: Not when I was there.  I think that was before.  The only club I remember was Buttercup, and that was really a dive, you know, but a lot of fun.  This was just before the disco era, you know, so things were changing.  (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: This is late '60s [1960s]. So this is approaching 1968.
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Early '70s [1970s], yeah.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Now you were back by '68 [1968], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I was going back and forth still.  I  was traveling again, you know, with the Ailey Company [Alvin Ailey American Theater Company].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And, but it was a very, it was a time to test my resources because, you know, when I finished that tour with "Black Nativity," I was in Copenhagen [Denmark], because I had friends there and they had those wonderful jazz clubs, and I had a friend who was a photographer and he was friends with a lot of musicians and I knew him in New York as well, and frankly I just the other day heard about his death, I didn't know.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: His name was Ola Brask.  He was Danish and he used to always take me to the jazz club there in Montmartre.  It was a very famous club, and I would meet a lot of musicians.  I remember Stuff Smith-
Speaker 1: The violinist.
Speaker 2: --the jazz violinist, and when musicians were always passing through there, they were always calling each other and Dizzy Gillespie would be in the airport, you know, saying, "Yeah, I just wanted to say hi, I just wanted to holler at you", you know.  So, there was nothing for me to do in Copenhagen.  I mean, I had dancer friends there and they were making some kind of a life, but there was nothing for me to do, so we went travelling down to Portugal and Spain, and then back up to France, and then France is where I stayed 'cause I had some friends there.
Story_ID: 106443
Speaker 1: Did you meet-- ever meet Josephine Baker?
Speaker 2: I did.  I went to see her perform at the Olympia and it was amazing.  I had seen her in the states performing at Carnegie Hall [New York City, New York] before I ever went to Europe and that was one of the most wonderful experiences I've ever had, but when I saw her at the Olympia, that was, I mean I felt even closer to her.  I've been a Francophile for a long time, you know, because I was a good French student.  I thought I would a linguist.  That was another thing I thought I might do.  So, knowing French helped a lot, but when I saw her at the Olympia, and I went back stage because I knew someone who was in the show, and there was this person at the call board, these big, huge, thick glasses on this lady, and kind of a dress-type thing, and I said, "Excuse me, I'm looking for my friend so-and-so" and she said, "Oh, she's right down there, just down the hall."  I said, "Okay, thank you."  And that was Josephine Baker, and I just, I mean she was so different off stage, you know, and she's just a larger than life personage on stage, you know, and that big voice, and she was just beautiful, but offstage, she was this lady with these big, thick, Coke-bottle glasses on and, you know, and a dress and I think she had a turban on or a scarf on her head, and I was so, I said, "Oh, silly, you should have asked her for an autograph."  I didn't realize it was she, you know.  So, that was my "meeting."
Story_ID: 673241
Speaker 1: So I'll start by slating.  I'm [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole.  I will be the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Scott Stearns is our videographer.  We are at Skadden and Arps [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP] at 4 Times Square in New York City [New York, New York], and we are continuing our interview with Ms. Sylvia Waters.  I would like for you to please say your own name, spell it for us, and tell us today's date.
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Sylvia Waters, S-Y-L-V-I-A, W-A-T-E-R-S, and it is October 24, 2016, my goodness (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yes.  And so, we're going to pick up where your interview left off and you were in Paris [France].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 673242
Speaker 1: So would you set the stage for--what, what took you to Paris [France]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was on an extended tour, or extensive and extended tour with 'Black Nativity' [Langston Hughes] that starred Marion Williams and the Stars of Faith for seven months and touring all over Europe, we were in Paris two or three times performing at the Champs-Elysees [Theatre des Champs-Elysees, Paris, France] and after that tour, I went to Copenhagen [Denmark] and I kind, I had a friend in Copenhagen and--I had a few friends in Copenhagen--and I felt while I was in Europe I really wanted to try and use whatever resources I had to, to stay in Europe and, you know, explore some possibilities of work in, in the dance world there, which was not anything like the dance world in New York [New York] or America.  I did get a couple of job offers that I didn't take; one was in Finland and I didn't want to be in Finland in the dark, in the winter.  This wonderful teacher and owner of the school, (unclear) had offered me, but I declined and another one was in Sweden with a company there; however, their budget couldn't sustain me for the first couple months of employment and I didn't see any sense in working without being paid, so--
Story_ID: 673243
Speaker 1: So, before we go to those jobs let's talk a little bit about 'Black Nativity.'  This is Langston Hughes--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did, did you meet him?
Speaker 2: I did, I did.  In London [England] in 1964, we were there at the Strand Theatre [Novello Theatre, London, England] for a month and he came for the opening night and, I mean, I was really thrilled and excited to meet him because he had been, I guess, one of my idols from the time I was fourteen years old.  I kind of discovered him on the library shelf in the li--
Speaker 1: What was the first thing you read of his?
Speaker 2: The first thing I read was 'Simple Speaks His Mind,' and then I started to read more of the Simple books and then I discovered his poetry and so he had just been part of my coming of age, you know, along with Holden Caulfield and 'Catcher in the Rye' [J.D. Salinger] that sort of thing.  So, when I met him it was backstage after the performance and he said, "Oh, that was wonderful.  That was a wonderful performance, Ms. Rivers." I said, "I've been a longtime admirer of yours, Mr. Hughes, and, my name is Waters [HistoryMaker Sylvia Waters]."  He said, "Oh yes, yes, yes, of course, Ms. Rivers."  He was a chain smoker and I said [sic.], "Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, of course, Ms. Rivers," and I said, "And I've read so many of your books and your poetry and, you know, you've just been one of my favorite writers and I'm just thrilled to be doing this show."  "Oh, thank you so much Ms. Rivers." And I said, "It's Waters."  And he said, "Yes, yes, yes of course, Ms. Rivers," and at that point I thought well, okay.  Maybe I should just change my name to Sylvia Rivers.  It sounds pretty good, you know, but that--
Speaker 1: About how old was he then?
Speaker 2: I don't know, fifty something, sixty, I don't know.  How old was he when he died?  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: But, so he came and he loved that, your performance.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean to have him tell me that personally was, was thrilling.  I mean, he was very, you know, very real, very, you know, approachable and--
Story_ID: 673244
Speaker 1: Tell me about your role in 'Black Nativity' [Langston Hughes].
Speaker 2: Well, I was one of the two dancers.  We were a pair; Morris Donaldson was my partner.  I was the Virgin Mary and he was Joseph, and it was, I liked it because it was dramatic as well as a lot of movement.  We were backed up by the singers.  We were often on stage with one of the singers, Marion Williams, or all of the singers at various times, and I loved the music.  I loved the audience response and it was my--
Speaker 1: Who choreographed it?
Speaker 2: Talley Beatty choreographed this version of it, and, and I really loved going from country to country and all of the different cultures and languages and people that were experiencing, I mean, for instance in Vienna [Austria] we were in the Theater an der Wien, which is the theater which I learned later that premiered Beethoven's [Ludwig van Beethoven] 'Ninth Symphony' ['Symphony No. 9 in D minor'], and, you know, those kind of histor- we performed in a lot of opera houses, especially in Italy, a lot of wonderful theaters and the audience was always enthusiastic and they loved, you know, the gospel music and the Christmas story and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: And so it's, the, the two of you, how many singers, how many people are on stage at the, the maximum?
Speaker 2: Well, it varied.  The Stars of Faith, there were four and the lead singer, Marion Williams, and there was another soloist, Princess Stewart who, I think didn't do the whole tour with us, and then there were the male singers, oh goodness and I feel terrible.  I've forgotten the name of that group but they, they were amazing, and there was, and so there were four male singers and a lead singer and Alex--the Alex Bradford singers [The Bradford Singers], well, Alex Bradford had done a lot of music also, but, and there was an organist, Bernie [Bernie Durant Jr.], I remember his name was, and so we were like a family.  They were wonderful spirited, positive, spiritual, you know, and very protective.  They used to call me Ms. Little (laughter) you know, because they were big ladies, you know, and they had travelled the world and had a certain sophistication that was, you know, just wonderful and warm.  I mean, I remember being on a flight when we got the news that Sam Cooke had died, and these were diehard Sam Cooke fans, devotees, you know, and one of them, I can't remember which one, she just fell to her knees in the aisle of the plane and just bawling and crying, they were so horrified, you know.
Speaker 1: You all were close.
Story_ID: 673245
Speaker 1: Now, as you were going to these different majestic performance halls, it's a small group.  And at a certain point, you know, it's just- the two of you are the dancers.  What was your experience of being on these grand stages all over the world? You know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, they varied in, the different venues varied in dimension, but, and there was a kind of a set piece we danced on and around, and it was, it was frightening but, at the same time it was thrilling.  It was exciting that you were reaching, communicating to so many people, and their response to what you were doing was very, very fulfilling.
Speaker 1: And this was 1964, right?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964] and early '65 [1965], yes.
Speaker 1: And you are performing all over the world 'Black Nativity' [Langston Hughes], all over Europe, at a time in the United States, when all hell was breaking loose (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Lots of turmoil.  Right.  And you know, interestingly enough, I don't know if I said in the previous interview, flight, our first performance was in Berlin [Germany] and we were on the same plane as Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], because he was en route to receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, but he did, he appeared at the Berlin Philharmonic and we appeared with him on that same stage.  I had to lip sync (laughter) because I wasn't a singer, but I never actually got to meet him, though we were in his presence, and recently within the last five years, I saw a poster from that event that I never knew existed at the Strand gallery [Strand Book Store, New York, New York] here, and I foolishly enough did not bid on it and then when I called to bid on it, it was too late.  Someone had already, and it wasn't that expensive but, you know, there it was with his name and the Stars of Faith, Brooklyn- I mean the Berlin Philharmonic and it was--
Speaker 1: So how generally were you received as you travelled around Europe?
Speaker 2: Very enthusiastic audiences, you mean in the theater?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Very enthusiastic audiences; extremely enthusiastic audiences.  There was always an encore at the end.  The dancers were not in the second part.  The second part was just the singers, and, but we had to stay.  We had to overdress with our costumes for the bows and the audiences were on their feet all the time.  I can't remember, I can remember only one performance where the audience was less than what it ever had been and that was in Italy.  They had, they could smoke and they could drink in the audience and the smoke was wafting up on stage and the singers were coughing and, you know, but that was the only performance I remember like that.
Story_ID: 673246
Speaker 1: And when you were just out and about in these countries how were you received as a black American woman?
Speaker 2: Generally warmly, openly, generally.  I didn't notice, I mean a lot of curiosity, of course, depending on the country.  In the Scandinavian countries, they were very warm, very friendly.  In France, they weren't especially warm and fuzzy friendly, but they weren't exactly cold either, but people were largely curious.  In Germany, they were generally warm, I seem to remember.  In Berlin [Germany], especially, because there you still had the wall [Berlin Wall], and the Germans were very much like Parisians in spirit, you know.  Live for today, you know, and we'll see what happens tomorrow.  You could hear them breaking the sound barrier and the supersonic planes and, you know, and then on the side of that wall were people who were desperate to get out.  So, there was that kind of spirit.  They were just living on the edge and you could feel that vibration and you certainly had an empathy for that.
Speaker 1: And as someone who had just come from the United States in the midst of the civil unrest, especially as it relates to black people, did you consciously notice a difference of how you were--how you moved through space, how you were treated, how you were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I noticed at that time there certainly weren't that many black people (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that I was certainly, that we were certainly unique and people responded to us in that way, but I felt generally in a positive way for the most part.  I didn't feel, I mean sometimes in a restaurant you might have had a rude waiter, but maybe he was rude to everybody--
Speaker 1: True.
Speaker 2: --you know, depending on what country you were in and sometimes they went overboard being extremely kind and, you know, I found more people, I met more people in sympathy with the plight of, you know, what was happening in America and, you know, you really didn't get into politics with people, generally.  You didn't open up a conversation or even end a conversation speaking politically, but your senses, you were certainly aware, you had the sensitivity of what was in the air in each country and you took in the spirit of that particular culture, you know, in Itali- Italy people were very, you know, very warm and open to you, you know, generally the Italians were, you know, playful.
Story_ID: 673247
Speaker 1: And so you decided you wanted to stay in Europe for a while, that's when you started--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because in each city, tried to go to the various local dance schools to take class and they were very open about that, allowing us to do that, and so the dance community is, I found, of course, a very--there was much more outreach there and spontaneity there, so, you know, I was rather comfortable in those circles.
Speaker 1: And in terms of the taking classes, what, what style of dance--
Speaker 2: Ballet (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That was it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Basically ballet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I hardly found any modern classes of anything I would have been familiar with, but that could have been the circumstances of that particular city.  I just didn't have that much.
Speaker 1: And so was ballet pretty consistent to what you had learned? Where there (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.  Plie, tendu, releve, yeah, yeah it was.  I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Was there anything unique (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --some were Russian style, there were different schools but pretty consistent.
Speaker 1: And you, did you speak French back then?
Speaker 2: I did, I had been a very good French student all through junior high [I.S. 164 Edward W. Stitt School, New York, New York] and high school [Evander Childs High School, Evander Childs Educational Campus, Bronx, New York] and so to put it to the real test, that was a challenge, that was a challenge, and when I decided to finally stay in Paris for a while is when I went to the Alliance Francaise [Alliance Francaise Paris Ile-de-France, Paris, France] for a month or two, and it was--
Speaker 1: There.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, the class is taught completely in French, so that helped me become less shy and more assertive about the French that I knew, and that way I have learned again to speak.
Speaker 1: And why did you choose France, Paris?
Speaker 2: Well it's strange.  I kind of ended up there.  I was in Denmark for about a month and a half and there didn't seem to be any work for me to do there.  There was nothing for me to do there.  Like I said, certain jobs, the two jobs I had been offered I didn't take, so this friend of mine and I, we went on a little hiatus.  We went on a vacation to Portugal, and then to Spain and, you know, we traveled around and because he got, had some health issues, actually, he got what was later diagnosed as gout, he had to go back to Copenhagen [Denmark] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: To a dancer, oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He wasn't, no, he wasn't a dancer, he was a photographer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I had known him in New York [New York], also, and so we were in Paris when coming from Spain and I had a couple of friends in Paris and a former roommate in Paris, and so I shared a hotel room with her and my friend had been in the first company of Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater], Jacqueline Wolcott [Jacqueline Wolcott Goldman] and she was married to Michael Goldman [sic. Guido Goldman], and they were living in Paris and she had two children, so I would babysit for her and also I got a job doing a television show that lasted for about six weeks and I met a lot of American dancers in that show; in fact, I knew some of them.  They had been with another show that closed, and they were fortunate enough to get this employment, those who decided to stay.
Speaker 1: So the show was an--
Speaker 2: I think it was Amen--I don't know who it was--'Amen Corner'--
Speaker 1: Oh, oh.
Speaker 2: --or 'Trumpets of the Lord' [ph.], or, it was--
Speaker 1: But you were doing it where? In--
Speaker 2: In Paris.  No, I was doing a television show in Paris with Michel Descombey who was then director of the Paris Opera Ballet and he was doing this show called 'Chaka Zulu' [Akin Euba], so of course, he had to employ a lot of people of color to do that.
Speaker 1: And, so the television show you're doing in Paris, was the--what was the show?
Speaker 2: 'Chaka Zulu' (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: That is it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: That was it, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh, so it was a performance.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They were filming your performance.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: So that was a long term project and it was fun.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was, 1965.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And how, how long did you stay with that project?
Speaker 2: About six weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was the six week (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: It went on and on and on (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was great.
Story_ID: 673248
Speaker 1: And what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: Well, then I started to look around for work and go to the various studios and meet some of the choreographers and the other dancers and I would get little TV emissions at the local TV and I met Ronnie Aul and Carmen Aul, his wife, and he was choreographing for TV so, and he had been with the Dunham Company [Katherine Dunham Company] some years before and they decided to stay in Paris [France] and make their life in Paris.
Speaker 1: You had, had you done dancing on television or film in New York [New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: In New York?  I had done one television show with [HistoryMaker] Donald McKayle, I had.
Speaker 1: But now, in Paris this is where the action is, I guess.
Speaker 2: That's where it was for me at the time--not much, but you know, some--and I also got in touch with the Bejart [Maurice Bejart] company [Ballet of the 20th Century] in Brussels [Belgium] and I knew he was looking for a dancer, so they invited me to come and audition and I did, and that was one of the most terrifying things.  I mean, he was one of the companies that was probably at that time, the most, I guess, forward, closest to contemporary work that I knew, that existed in Europe.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it--because it was mostly ballet?
Speaker 2: It was, the vocabulary was primarily ballet but he did, he had a lot of modern constructs, modern concepts.  He was very contemporary in that sense and so when I went to audition, he had me audition at the cirque de la Monnaie [Cirque Royal, Brussels, Belgium], which is kind of like a Madison Square Garden [New York, New York], and he was way up in the back in the sound booth and I was way down on the stage.  I said, oh my goodness, I must look like an ant, you know, and I guess he did that to see how I projected, you know, and I had choreographed this dance and I had never felt myself a choreographer, and so it was a tribute to every choreographer I ever, I had ever worked with and after that, he came down and he said, "Very nice.  I like your quality," and, you know, he wanted to hire me for this huge spectacle, this huge ballet he had done, the ballet of the 'Ninth Symphony,' Beethoven's [Ludwig van Beethoven] 'Ninth Symphony' ['Symphony no. 9 in D minor'], 'Ode to Joy,' and I was to have a central part in that in the fourth, the last section, and I had seen the piece and I asked him, I said, well in addition, "Could I ask you, would it be possible to also do the third section."  He said, "Oh, yeah," he said, "I could see why you would want to do that.  That's your quality."  I said, "Yes and it's an adagio section," and I would be doing--partner with another male dancer, who was Chinese, actually, and he said, "Yes, yes.  That would be possible."  And, I had had a friend who had done the 'Ninth Symphony' before, la neuvieme as they called it.  Cristyne Lawson, so, and I knew she had done that also, so that's why I asked, but--
Speaker 1: And he said yes.
Speaker 2: And he said yes, yes.  So I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So then, did you move?
Speaker 2: I stayed in Paris.  I commuted.  I would stay in Brussels to rehearse but I lived in Paris--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I was hired really as a guest artist so I would come when they would do the 'Ninth Symphony,' but he approached me about being a permanent regular member of the company, but he wanted me to do more pointe work and I said, "Oh, I would need some time," and they were getting ready to do an extensive tour of Canada for the Olympics [1968 Summer Olympics, Mexico City, Mexico], I believe, and Japan and I said I would need a little more time to prepare to go en pointe and, you know, I started learning some of the repertoire, some of the more contemporary rep that wasn't en pointe, but I decided that that wasn't going to work, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: So, that was not something that you typically did, to dance en pointe?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I mean, I had pointe since school but I wasn't strong en pointe and I would need to work at that.  So, I declined that and that was a huge decision because I said now, here's your shot, you know.  You could, you should do this but I--
Speaker 1: Did you decline because you felt you weren't ready?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You didn't think you could?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, I continued on a guest artist basis whenever they did the 'Ninth Symphony' and I continued to do these television shows.
Story_ID: 673249
Speaker 1: Also, I worked with [HistoryMaker] Donald McKayle's company [Donald McKayle and Dancers] that was touring Europe.  It was a company [sic.] called 'Black New World' and it was an assemblage of several of his ballets into one to make this historical narrative and we toured many, many cities in Europe and that was exciting because I was working with people I knew very well, and a style I was familiar with and new people.
Speaker 2: So who were some of the people?
Speaker 1: Bill Luther was in the company, Geraldine Seignious, Mary Barnett--who else--John Parks, Trina Parks.
Speaker 2: And did you know Don McKayle?
Speaker 1: Oh yes. I had worked with Don McKayle when--I had worked with him. I had studied with him when I was in New York [New York].  Yeah, he was one of my first mentors and teachers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Great, and so he, so all these people are in Europe at the same time.  What was, what was the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, no.  This is what happened next (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is what happened next.
Speaker 2: So what year are we talking about?
Speaker 1: Now, we've moved up to '66 [1966]; '66 [1966], '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And in the meantime when I wasn't doing that, I mean, I toured with them for, I think, three months and ironically I was supposed to have originally done that tour.  I had come back to New York in '65 [1965] and I was a day late because I was reading for a part in a movie.  I was auditioning for that, which made me a day late, and Bill Luther didn't get my message, so when I got to New York, he replaced me.  I said, "I told you I was coming."  Anyhow, I got to do the show, anyhow (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Anyhow.
Speaker 1: And about Paris [France], a lot of, you know, wonderful things were there for me to explore; I mean, I was going down reading for roles and film, which I hadn't thought about.  I always liked acting.  I had never had any formal acting training, but it was a challenge to, you know, really have a go at this and meet directors.  Like, I remember meeting John Huston and going to this, this agent sent me to this audition and while waiting and there was Marpessa Dawn, I don't know if you remember her from 'Black Orpheus'--
Speaker 2: What's her name?
Speaker 1: Marpessa Dawn.  Well, she was sitting there and I considered her a huge star, but she was there waiting to audition also and I said, "Oh, my goodness," you know, and so when it was my turn to go in for the interview, it wasn't a reading, it was an interview, and John Huston was enormously tall, deep voice, and I was just terrified and he just asked me a few questions like how did I like it in Paris and da da da da da da, and I remember he had this little Band-Aid on his chin--I guess a cut from shaving--and I just kind of focused on that, you know, and then he thanked me and I left and afterwards I spoke to the casting agent.  She said, "Well, I'm gonna arrange another audition for you."  Anyhow, that's a long story.  I didn't get the part, and, but at least they got in touch with me, and another thing I had auditioned for was with this director, Peter Glenville, I had to do a cold reading and he liked the reading very much and he said, "We'll be in touch," so I said, "I'm going to New York tomorrow."  He said, "We'll be in touch.  Don't worry."  And, so I went to New York.  I didn't hear from them.  When I got back there was a telegram for me--we got telegrams in those days--it said, "We really liked your work but we've decided to go with someone else.  We have your information on file and we look forward to seeing you in the future."  So, I said well at least they--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, they were very gracious.
Story_ID: 673250
Speaker 1: I was thinking about the, the flight with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and I'm surprised that you all didn't go up and just speak to him.
Speaker 2: Well, there's a very good reason for that.  He was in first class (laughter)--
Speaker 1: And you were not (laughter).
Speaker 2: --and we were not.  But, Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] had accompanied him to see him off.  That was in the days when you could go to the plane with your, you know, like my dad [Benjamin Waters] came to the plane with me.  But, yeah, it would have been great.  We were thrilled, but hey, we were in good hands.
Speaker 1: Very good.  So, I want to know about, a little bit about living in Paris [France].  You know, so many people romanticize what it's like.  I'm curious, what neighborhood were you living in?
Speaker 2: I was living in the grooviest neighborhood of all, the 6th arrondissement [Paris, France] around Saint-Germain [Saint-Germain-des-Pres, Paris, France].  I was living on la rue Mazarine.  First, I was living in a hotel with a roommate.  She had been a roommate of mine in New York [New York], and but then she left Paris and then I moved around the corner to a small studio with a friend on la rue Mazarine, and to me it was like living in a big city, kind of like the village, but, you know, you did your shopping and it all seemed just very natural to me and the more assertive I became about speaking French, because the French have, you know, that if you don't speak French, you don't have a language, you know, the easier it became.  I mean, the hardest thing for me was answering the telephone.  If I didn't understand you I just hung up (laughter).  It was terrifying and that took a while to get used to, and I got to know the transportation system so I could take public transportation, you know, and you develop a certain street smart and, you know, pretty savvy.
Speaker 1: So--so you felt safe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was a walking city, it was a walking city, and I, you could walk a lot of places and at that time, I did.  I remember meeting this actor, James Campbell; he was really Senegalese.  I never knew his Senegalese name, but he spoke English without, with almost an American accent.  He had studied many American films, and I met him in Genoa [Italy], actually, when I was on tour with 'Black Nativity' [Langston Hughes], and ran into him in Paris and he was just always very warm and friendly.  He worked for Roger Vadim at the time, a big French filmmaker, and, you know, so skirting around Paris it, it was a lot of fun.  You felt as though you were in a very active, you know, environment and that was also at the time that Malcolm X came through Paris after his--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And did you see him when he came through?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  You know, that was not a sold out event, but it wasn't easy for me, but I knew a lot of people who did.  I knew a lot of American, I wouldn't--some of them were expate- expats [expatriate], some of them were just there like me, a lot of Ethiopian, a lot of Canadian, a lot of different, really a melange of people, but he, I remember when he was there at the time and--
Speaker 1: Was your traveling to Europe the first time that you were exposed to such a broad cross section of cultures or did that happen in New York?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a New Yorker, so I was exposed to a broad cross section, but this was a broader cross section.  This was all about, you know, lifestyle and day to day, you know living and you got to know it really intimately being in those countries.  Something I was going to say that seemed pertinent that just went out of my mind--
Speaker 1: You were speaking of Malcolm X.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I was in, I was in Portugal when Dr. King was shot and I was walking, I had just bought a Herald Tribune [International Herald Tribune; The New York Times International Edition] and I was walking down the street and I was there performing with a French company, an assemblage of dancers by Arthur Plechard for about three months, two and a half months, and we left Paris exactly when the huge strikes had started, started with the students and then it was the whole country and it was just a mess.
Story_ID: 673251
Speaker 1: But anyhow, we were in Portugal and I was reading this tiny little article about Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] having been shot, and I mean, it was as though I had been shot.  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't process that, and then as the day went on and the days went on the articles, of course, got bigger and bigger and bigger, and I'm, and that's when I began to feel pangs of homesickness and- because one thing I learned in going to all of these places is self identity.  You are who you are.  You are an African American, which wasn't the term at the time.  You are this individual, this person of color wherever you go, and I learned there was racism wherever you go, no matter how people seem to embrace you and embrace what you were and what you stood for.  There were times when that was, when something else was in evidence and I felt that very strongly, unfortunately.
Speaker 2: Do you have an example of something that happened?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.  My, when we were in Portugal, there were about four of us who, there was a company of twelve dancers and three of us rented an apartment.  Various people were in various places throughout.  We were in Estoril [Portugal] performing at the casino [Casino Estoril], and my roommate, she was an American of Irish descent, Maureen Burns [ph.], a very nice person and after the show very often we were met by young Portuguese guys, you know, who would take us to clubs or take us to this neighboring village Cascais [Portugal] (gestures) for dinner.  You could get the most delicious steaks and fish--anyhow--and there were also people there from--where they were have--one of their colonies, help me, it's out of my mind.
Speaker 2: Where, where, you're in Europe--
Speaker 1: Yes.  And the Portuguese were at war with their- this colony in Africa.  Oh, gosh.  That's terrible, I cannot.  This is terrible.  Anyhow, they were black people and so we would all go out together.  They were the musicians, and I remember one evening we were sitting around this big round table and one of the Portuguese--and usually the Portuguese, the middle class and the rich are the ones that went into the army, not the poor, and they were the rich, white class--anyhow, so we were all sitting around this table United Nations like, okay, and there's this Dupont lighter [S.T. Dupont], a very expensive lighter on the table, and everybody smoked at that time, and he was sitting next to one of the guys from--it's right on the tip of my tongue--it's not Madagascar, it's, it's a Portuguese.  Anyhow, he was sitting next to one of these guys and the lighter was on the table and I could see him looking sideways at this guy and he was a little uncomfortable, so I saw him just take his lighter and move it and put it in his pocket, because everybody had been using his lighter, you know.  Okay.  Let's not say that's racism.  You know, it's a fine line, but I really do know that had he been sitting next to a white Portuguese, he would never have picked up that lighter.  It would have been there for everyone to use.  You know, so there, there were subtle signs unlike, there, we would go to the beach every day before we had to go to work and there was one guy that had a boat and he would invite certain people out to his boat.  I was never invited.  It didn't bother me.  I'm not that crazy about boats anyhow, but it always in the harbor, you know, so I--
Speaker 2: You were the only one who wasn't invited?
Speaker 1: I was one of the only ones, yeah.
Speaker 2: Were the other people black too--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --who were not invited?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I said to Maureen one day, I said you know that guy So and So, So and So, I think he, because he was always pointing out, "You're so different than other Americans."  I said, "Oh, how many Americans do you know?"  And she said, "Oh, you're just being sensitive."  I said, "Yeah, that's what all of you say, all of you white people say we're sensitive as soon as we bring up things that come to our attention."
Story_ID: 673252
Speaker 1: And another time, a French boyfriend of mine came to Portugal to visit, and we went out.  This was after the casino thing was over and we went out to Cascais [Portugal] for dinner and--
Speaker 2: What, what casino thing are you referring to?
Speaker 1: The job I was doing.
Speaker 2: Ah, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And we went out there to have dinner where I had gone so many, many times and there was a guy there with his friends who felt we were staring at him but we weren't, so he came over and he was a little drunk and he said, "Well, I want you to know," and this friend of mine had long hair, you know, and he said, "I want you to know that we know what to do with you with long hair."  Then he said, "Really?  What is that?"  And he said, "Well, we take it out and fix it for you."  He said, "Well, I don't think you're gonna do that."  And, then he said, "You know, I'm in the [U.S.] Army and you know where I got my training; in Fort Bragg [North Carolina], in America."  I said "Yeah, and so?"  "So, I'm just letting you know, you know."  And also at the time Portugal had a dictator [Americo Tomas].  It wasn't a democracy as we know it.  So, things started to get a little hairy and his friends, you know, came over and pulled him away and things calmed down.  The next day in a cafe in Estoril [Portugal] we were sitting and there was this big eruption in the cafe, and this same guy comes storming out while he had been sitting next to some African students in the cafe and he didn't, he started an argument with them and he didn't like them being there, plain and simple and he stormed out and we saw him go past and says, "Oh my goodness, there he goes again;" so there were instances like that.
Speaker 2: And, was it that you started noticing them more after you were there for a while?
Speaker 1: No, I think that they were more overtly displayed than before.  Ah, I wish I could remember the name of this country--can't you google it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, so I was, and Portugal also is a very conservative country, like these ladies, young ladies, did not go out unescorted, you know, so they weren't hanging out in the discos and those who were marriageable and, you know, respectful so, you know, I began to notice that in their society (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And how long were--did you spend in Portugal?
Speaker 1: About three months, two and a half to three months.  And the most fun I had was going to a Portuguese bullfight.  I had never seen anything like that, you know, where they have not only the bullfighting, which was a little different than Spain, but they also had the bull wrestlers and I noticed that one of the bull wrestlers was black (laughter).  You know, that was something I--and I had just never seen anything like that, people challenging the bull that way.
Speaker 2: So this is 1968?
Speaker 1: This is like, yeah it's like, '68 [1968], yeah, because that's when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --killed.
Story_ID: 673253
Speaker 1: Just to be clear on the timeline, you went to Portugal when there was so much unrest in Paris [France], it was time to get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but not because of--
Speaker 1: Oh, you had a job (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --I was contracted to do this job--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So, it, it, it was good timing.  Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --and it just, it was happening at that time. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the unrest in Paris, can you describe, because you've mentioned it but could you talk about that a little bit more?
Speaker 2: Well, I seem to remember it started with a strike of some kind.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the students got very, very activated about this and then I remember the army was, because there started doing many, many demonstrations and the army starting lining the bridges and the transportation was shut down and, maybe it was a transportation strike.  I can't exactly remember, but it seemed like the whole country started to go on strike.  I remember the day before I was leaving for Portugal, I was in a department store getting some last minute things and the woman says, (speaking French) "Je suis desolee, on fait la greve."  She says, "I'm sorry, I can't serve you, we're going on strike."  (Laughter) Right then and there I said, "Oh, okay," and I left and in order to travel we had to take a bus to Brussels [Belgium] and then get a flight from Brussels to Portugal, and we could not use the French air space, so it made the flight an hour longer, you had to fly around France.
Speaker 1: So literally they were shut down (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, there was upheaval, I mean these students were pulling those huge stones out of the sidewalk in Saint-Michel [Place Saint-Michel, Paris, France], you know.  They were really vehement about their cause.
Story_ID: 673254
Speaker 1: You described that after being in Portugal and not being as comfortable as you might--your project is the--is complete, you're ready to go home at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm thinking about going home.  I was missing dances I knew, a dance that I had been trained to do, and there was a great surge of dance interest in American and companies and the beginning of funding (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And the Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] was formed already (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, and one of the, you know, it's funny because there were three times that, oh there were two times that perhaps I would have worked for the Ailey company.  One was when I was still at Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York] and at that time they were pickup companies and I ran into--
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: It was a company that would come together, the choreographer would bring dancers together for one or two performances--
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: --and they would rehearse and rehearse and rehearse, and once those performances were done, that was the end until the next time; and so, Alvin, I ran into him at a performance at the 92nd Street Y [New York, New York], the Kaufmann auditorium [Kaufmann Concert Hall, New York, New York], which was a great hub for dance, and he said, "What are you doing?"  And I said, "Well, I'm going to summer school because I'm trying to finish Juilliard early."  He said, "Oh, great, okay."  And then I heard he was doing some production in New Jersey that summer and I went, oh, why didn't I keep my mouth shut?  You know, I would love to have done it.  And, another time was when I ran into the company in Portugal; I'm sorry, in Copenhagen [Denmark].  And, again, I knew many of the people there.  I had been with them in London [England] at the beginning of my tour with 'Black Nativity' [Langston Hughes].  We were all in London at the same time and I would go to see performances when mine was finished.  I was roommates with one of the dancers.  We hung out together, so it was like my dance family, and so when I saw them in Copenhagen and I saw the repertoire and I saw, and 'Revelations' [Alvin Ailey] was really, it was like the crystallized version of 'Revelations,' I think that was the beginning of my homesickness.
Speaker 1: Well, just for context now, could you say in Europe, they're primarily doing ballet?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the Ailey company and 'Revelations,' this is a completely different type of dance.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Even in the United States, and then (unclear) travelling around Europe.  How were the European audiences responding to it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Fantastic.  They were on their feet.  They were fantastic.  And I was right there with them, you know.
Speaker 1: Were you missing the new modern dance (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I was missing, I was missing what they were doing, yes, I was, and we had talked about me joining the company at that juncture.
Speaker 1: You and Alvin Ailey (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Alvin, yeah.  But it, they were touring and it was very difficult to learn repertory on tour, so he, instead got in touch with Michelle Murphy [ph.], who had previously been in the company and knew the rep [reparatory], and she was also in Paris [France], so she did it.
Speaker 1: This is now, so this is still around what year?
Speaker 2: In '66 [1966]--
Speaker 1: When you saw them there--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I saw them several, I saw them a couple of times.  I saw them in Paris once, also.
Speaker 1: When did he start his company?
Speaker 2: Officially, 1958.
Speaker 1: So, it had been around for a while.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean it was still a new company.
Speaker 2: But at this point, it was, he was working with dancers more consistently, the same dancers more consistently, it wasn't so much of a pickup company and he had more bookings more consistently, primarily in Europe more so than the United States at that time.
Speaker 1: So, as you are deciding whether you'll come back to the United States--
Speaker 2: Well, it was just a thought.  It wasn't even, it wasn't a plan.  It wasn't a plan; it was, you know, one of these hm, next, you know, that sort of thing.  And--
Speaker 1: And there was no one that, well that made you want to stay there?
Speaker 2: Not that made me, well no, that's not true.  I had a personal life also, and I guess that also was one of the deciding factors, you know, about my comings and goings.
Story_ID: 673255
Speaker 1: I think working with Bejart [Maurice Bejart] was certainly a highlight and in going to Mexico with that company--
Speaker 2: And this was for the Olympics [1968 Summer Olympics, Mexico City, Mexico].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So how did that come to you, because--
Speaker 1: Well, he was taking that piece, the 'Ninth Symphony' ['Symphony No. 9 in D minor,' Ludwig van Beethoven]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In which I performed.  And they were also going to Cuba, but I couldn't go to Cuba because I didn't have a passport to go to Cuba.  I mean, Americans couldn't travel to Cuba at that time, so instead I came to New York [New York].
Speaker 2: So, let's talk about the Olympics for a minute, because you, you performed with Bejart's company [Ballet of the 20th Century] at the 1968 Olympics.  This is one of the most famous Olympics of all.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Well, you know, the, I met a lot of athletes; I met a lot of Cuban athletes, actually, Cuban soccer or basketball team, and I had never met black Cubans directly from Cuba.  When you say he was from Cuba, I said oh, okay.  But I think I had left.  I think our performances were over by the time those basketball players, because--
Speaker 2: So you were gone--
Speaker 1: --I saw that when I was in New York.
Speaker 2: Oh, you saw that on TV.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  I wasn't there on site (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Ah, becau- well you were part of, you performed--at, at what point during the Olympics did you perform?
Speaker 1: It was at the beginning.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It was at the beginning.
Speaker 2: But, was it--
Speaker 1: It was not part of the opening ceremony, no.
Speaker 2: Right, it wouldn't be, because that would've been the locals.
Speaker 1: It was one of the performances they had in this huge park, which had a big, big theater.
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: Chapultepec [Bosque de Chapultepec, Mexico City, Mexico], I think, was the name of the park.
Speaker 2: And how, can you describe that experience of performing there?
Speaker 1: Well, it was like a huge arena and it was thousands of people and it was, it was glorious.  It was glorious and they were, you know, I'm sure it was a very international audience and they were very, very receptive.  They were just overwhelmed by it.
Speaker 2: And, how long were you in Mexico?
Speaker 1: Oh, about two weeks, so I think we had maybe four or five performances.
Speaker 2: Did you get a chance to travel around in Mexico City [Mexico]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did, and we went to one kind of suburb or neighboring town.  There was a festival going on and, you know, that sort of thing; the reg- the regular touristy things.  We went to a lot of the markets.  I loved markets.
Speaker 2: Mexico City is very densely populated, huge city.  Did it, how was it, you said you went to the markets, I mean navigating in such a densely populated place, was that easy for you?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was easy.  I mean, once you could figure out the transportation and they had these taxis, which picked up two and three people at a time, and I didn't really know Spanish.  I've always regretted that, but I, we managed to learn hello, goodbye, thank you, you're welcome, and how much (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Right, so you could get by (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing, and the numbers, yes.
Story_ID: 673256
Speaker 1: So, you come back because you can't go to Cuba, so you come back to the states.  Do you know that you're going to work with the Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] at that point?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.  In fact, I was getting ready to rehearse with the Donald McKayle company [Donald McKayle and Dancers] for a tour, and I ran into Alvin [Alvin Ailey] at the Brooklyn Academy of Music [Brooklyn, New York] for, I think it was a Martha Graham performance or something and he said, "Sylvia [HistoryMaker Sylvia Waters]."  He was with his lighting designer, Nick Cernovitch [Nicholas Cernovitch], and he said, "What are you doing?"  I said, "Nothing," because nothing had been official, official yet.  He said, "I'm looking for a dancer."  I said, "Okay."  And--
Speaker 1: Well, he had asked you that, what are you doing before (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right. And this time I was, I had an answer, and then I thought oh, you need to tell Donnie McKayle that this is what you're gonna do, and that was very difficult.  But, for some, and I was supposed to also go back to Paris [France] to join the Bejart [Maurice Bejart] company [Ballet of the 20th Century] for performances in Paris, so it was, you know, a bouquet of wonderful events in my life and very difficult decisions to make, but I, for some reason, I felt in Ailey it was some intangible something that said do this.  Do this.  This is, I don't know, long term, I, I don't know.  I just felt I needed to do this, and I don't know if I had mentioned before that the director of Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York], Martha Hill, when I graduated I ran into her a year after on the subway and she said, "What are you doing?"  I said, "Well, I'm working with [HistoryMaker] Donald McKayle, and I'm rehearsing with this one and that one and I'm working in Bloomingdale's [Bloomingdale's Inc., New York, New York]," and, you know, all of that stuff, and she said, "You need to get with the Alvin Ailey company.  That is going to be the company one day, especially for," I guess she said Negroes or, she didn't say black and she didn't say of color.  I said, "Really."  I said, "Well darling," she said, "you get with Alvin and keep working on your ballet."  And that kind of always stayed in the back of my mind.  She told me I'd always I'd always have a circuitous kind of path in my career, you know.
Speaker 1: And she was your--?
Speaker 2: She was the director of Juilliard when I was there.  Martha Hill.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so when he asked me, I immediately answered, and based on what I had seen of the company in Copenhagen [Denmark], I was very excited about the prospect of learning ballets, because it was not a single choreography company.  It had the works of many choreographers and I was excited about learning that and really broadening my whole dance experience.  So, it was heartbreaking for me to tell Donnie--
Speaker 1: How did he receive it?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He understood (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was okay, yeah.  And, I had to get in touch with the Bejart company and I found a replacement for myself.
Speaker 1: Oh, good.
Speaker 2: In fact, Judy recommended a friend that was in Sweden at the time.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Judith Jamison.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Diane Gray.  So, I--because there was one lady here.  I had wanted her to do it, Enid Aytch, who became Enid Britten [Enid Britten-Stux] later, who was a beautiful dancer, beautiful brown, lovely and was very strong in classical ballet and I said, "He'll love you."  She was just leaving the Ailey company and I said, "Why are you leaving?"  She said, "I'm ready to leave."  Okay.  And, I said, "Well, you should go to Bejart.  He would love you and there's a place for you there.  Please."  She said, "No, no, no.  I'm going to be working with Stuart (unclear)."  I said, "Oh, no, Enid.  You must do this," and she wouldn't.  And a year later, she travelled to Brussels [Belgium] and couldn't even get an audition with him, anyhow, but Diane got the job.  Met her husband [James Viera] down there in Brussels, a successful investment banker and she has lived happily ever after.  I saw her the other day and she always thanks me for that.
Story_ID: 673257
Speaker 1: So I started to work with the Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre].
Speaker 2: So in- you obviously had met Alvin Ailey years before.  You had seen the work many times.
Speaker 1: And he had seen me perform also as a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  And so now, you're working with them.  What--can, can you describe what it was like to work with Alvin Ailey and with his company?
Speaker 1: Well, it was an immediate rapport with the dancers; not only because I knew them but I admired them so much.  I mean, Dudley Williams I had known, and I met George Faison [HistoryMaker George W. Faison] and Michelle Murray--I knew Michelle--and [HistoryMaker] Judith Jamison.  I had met her previously but I didn't really know her yet.  But, meeting her at that juncture was, I mean we were like family, and it was an integrated company.  There was Ernie Pagnano [Ernest Pagnano].  There was Renee Rose [Renee Rose Thorpes], Linda Kent, Harvey [Harvey Cohen]--
Speaker 2: So, from the beginning it was integrated?
Speaker 1: Not quite from the beginning, but soon after; relatively soon after.
Story_ID: 673258
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?  The gentleman's name, your friend?  Who--the person, the Angolan man?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But anyway we can say it a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But there were a group of Angolan musicians.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So let's--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): You're rolling.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The story that you were telling about Portugal with the subtlety with the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, which weren't so subtle (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, well I knew and worked with a group of Angolan musicians and the people from Angola were at war [Angolan War of Independence].  There was a war going on and a lot of the young Portuguese middle class and upper classes were in the army and when they came back, their attitudes were, you know, probably very changed by their experiences in the war and so when you met a lot of these young men, there was a tension, you know, and as friendly as we all seemed to be with each other, there was a tension that was evident in their, you know, reaction to these musicians from Angola and like I described the incident sitting at the table and, you know, protecting his personal property, his lighter and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: I want to ask you one more question about the uprising in France.  When you left, this was at about the same time as when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died.
Speaker 2: It was before.
Speaker 1: Right before, okay.
Speaker 2: It was, yeah, it was in the same--yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh right, because you were in Portugal when--okay.  So--
Speaker 2: But in France, that uprising didn't seem to have any racial connotations, although they had had many issues with the North African population, the Algerian population there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: The Algerians.  And when you were there, were you aware of the racial tension with the Algerians?
Speaker 2: I was aware of it.  I was aware there had been really, you know, tremendous unrest in the palace and France and there was, there were many, many immigrant Africans from Senegal, you know.  I mean, you also had the Martinique, Guadeloupeans that were there.  So, you had a large percentage of people of color in France.
Speaker 1: And how were they treated?
Speaker 2: Well, they were at the--unless they were the sons and daughters of royalty they weren't treated very well, but the hostility kept, you know, for the most part in abeyance, while I was there.
Story_ID: 673259
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's go back to the U.S.  Your--you were telling me about dancing and working with Alvin Ailey, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was so exciting and so important to me.  I mean, I was just, I mean I've always been impassioned about working in the dance field and being able to actually be paid for it, you know.  I felt very fortunate, and with the Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] it just felt like such, like we had so much to say, so much to communicate physically and spiritually, and we were preparing for the first Broadway appearance at the Billy Rose Theatre [David T. Nederlander Theatre, New York, New York] followed by, I think, a seven week American tour, and that just seemed like a huge chunk of work and, I don't know, in five or six weeks we had to learn what seemed like a huge repertory in preparation for this season, and it was just, you know, every day was a new day which, with new movement, new, new situations, rehearsing with Talley Beatty and Alvin's pieces and, it was just really, you know--
Speaker 1: And (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I was so sore (laughter), I was in such pain, you know.
Speaker 1: Because it's so--
Speaker 2: Vigorous, yeah.  But good pain, good pain.
Speaker 1: Now, you say you were prepping for Broadway and about to go on a U.S. tour, so things were, there was a lot of work.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Things were on the ascendance.
Speaker 1: Because, you know, you read about the Ailey company over time, especially in the early years, there were a lot of stops and starts in terms of having consistent money (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, there seemed to be more continuity at this point.  You felt like you had a job, you know, a contract.  A long term contract.
Speaker 1: And where were you dancing, where were you rehearsing?
Speaker 2: We were rehearsing at the Clark Center [Clark Center for the Performing Arts; Clark Center NYC, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Where was that?
Speaker 2: --which was in the, it was at 50th Street and 8th Avenue in the YMCA or YWCA [Westside YWCA, New York, New York], it was a Y, and at the time we were there, I mean the Clark Center had started, I guess, about 1962, '61 [1961], when Alvin was looking for rehearsal space and Charles Blackwell had helped him find the space at the Y, and so Alvin kind of became the resident choreographer and he helped him set up a dance program and Edele Holtz was then director of the Y, so many companies were now provided space to rehearse and present and that's how it started (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And because it's the Y, it's affordable space, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So in exchange for using that space, Alvin Ailey created a dance program for that, is that what I (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, he helped with structuring the classes, and so forth, yes.
Speaker 1: Beyond his own company.
Speaker 2: I mean, that wasn't the only place he had rehearsed, but that became one of the main places for it.
Speaker 1: And you said you were sore, and it was rigorous.  How many hours are you practicing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, we were rehearsing six to seven hours a day--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --five days a week (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Five days a week.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It's so--
Speaker 2: And I don't think the dancers were paid for that.  They were collecting unemployment.  I got a mere stipend of fifty dollars because I wasn't eligible for unemployment--
Speaker 1: During--
Speaker 2: --but I was glad to get it.
Speaker 1: Fifty dollars per--
Speaker 2: Week.
Speaker 1: Wow, and this is 1968, still.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, '68 [1968] going into '69 [1969], yeah.
Speaker 1: So, they gave you something because you weren't yet eligible for unemployment.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, that is a cycle that many performers talk about, that--
Speaker 2: Declination and the note and not being paid and collecting unemployment, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.  That is part of the cycle for many people pursuing their passion.
Speaker 2: I mean, hopefully it's, it's better today.  It is in many ways.  It is in many ways; however, it's still very, very difficult to get work, to establish a company, to establish a good working situation for a company.  Economically, it's still, it's a struggle.
Story_ID: 673260
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the, the, the life of a dancer.  So, you're prac- you're rehearsing six to seven hours a day, how do you take care of your body when you are, because you have to stay strong and healthy and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Well, we had company class.  We had class, Alvin [Alvin Ailey] insisted on that, and you had to be sure, the basic things, get enough rest, eat well, you know.  There wasn't that much hanging out, although we were social animals.  But--
Speaker 1: And you were young.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you just had to not go out, or--
Speaker 2: Well, you really couldn't afford to go that many places (laughter), you know.  I mean, there were movies and things but, you know, the disco scene hadn't hit yet, you know.  But--
Speaker 1: So what was, so what was night life like in general in New York City around this time?
Speaker 2: I don't remember doing very much, quite honestly.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I think we probably ate at each other's house sometimes and went to concerts.  You know, you were kind of steeped in theater and dance, and, but mostly you had to rest to be ready for that next rehearsal.
Speaker 1: And, what did you eat, what was a dancer's diet?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to say I always ate pretty well, I mean, healthily; you know, lots of fruit and vegetables.  I was- I liked hamburgers but, you know, once McDonald's happened I never ate a McDonald's hamburger.  I had one in my life to this day.  I'm sure, I was very skinny so I didn't have a weight problem.  I wasn't, I didn't drink much alcohol or beer, you know, and after Europe I never drank sodas again--
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Sugar--and what I note, because in Europe, first of all, they would always serve you a soda with no ice.  They never had ice.  So you learned to drink water.  You learned to drink wine (laughter).  You learned to drink beer--and I just didn't drink--or some other juices, but I never drank sodas.  I never drank another Coca-Cola or Pepsi Cola; occasionally, a ginger ale.  But I know I tried to maintain a good diet and, at that time, I knew I was eating meat and potatoes and, you know, vegetables and I liked desserts.  I liked milkshakes.  I, I talked myself into believing milkshakes were healthy but, again, I didn't have the weight problem so it didn't, you know, show on me (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 673261
Speaker 1: At this point in Mr. Ailey's company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater], was he welcoming women of different body types?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he liked, I would say, how can I say this?  He liked well formed women.  He liked all kinds of dancers.
Speaker 1: Well, because see this is, I mean just for a context this is not common in a dance company, even today.  You know, the stories of ballet dancers are of starving themselves or close to that.
Speaker 2: Well, Alvin [Alvin Ailey] didn't, let me, I'll be honest, he didn't like fat dancers, okay?  He liked full bodied women as well as very skinny women, very long women, he liked the long line, yeah, and he, he refined his tastes as he went along.  Yeah, so he did.  But he did consider, you know, his was not the Balanchine [George Balanchine] image, the little head, the long legs.  He liked that.  He loved that.  But he also liked the little short fat one who could turn fast.  He said that, you know.
Speaker 1: And so, how--
Speaker 2: But I can remember him, like getting on some of the girls about their weight.  He did.  He would buy them, you know, cups of yogurt every now and then.  They'd go, "Oh, Alvin."  He said, "No, this is good for you.  This is what you should be eating," yeah.  But he liked, you know, a women with some flesh on her bones as well.
Speaker 1: And flesh on her bones obviously being different from being overweight.  Those are two different things.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: During these days--this beginning time for you being in the company, how was the company received in terms of on the stage there are these different female forms, much broader, a much broader view of a woman than--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't--
Speaker 1: Or was that not true then?
Speaker 2: --we were, we were a reflection of what people are in our audiences.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: We were a reflection of that.  But, like I said, they were beautiful bodies.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: They were long bodies.  They were muscular bodies.  They were lean bodies.  You know, they all had, and each dancer was very different, was very unique, you know.  You know, Alvin used to always say, "You are the most unique person," you know.  And there were different colors and different height sizes, yeah.  So it was a very eclectic array of personalities, and audiences responded to that because many of Alvin's ballets were character driven.  They were about characters.  They were about people.  They were about our humanity, and people, it changed the way people, I think, looked at dance and looked at dancers.  It was really dance theater, and yet these dancers were very, they were very technical as well as dramatic.
Story_ID: 673262
Speaker 1: So, the, the acting that you had begun to do, you know, a few years earlier, did that kick in?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, it did.  I was given an opportunity, which was a terrifying opportunity because Alvin [Alvin Ailey] gave you a lot of space.  He said, you know, "These steps are nothing unless you make something of it," you know.  And so he, you had to, you had the chance to inhabit this space with a personage, you know, rather than just doing steps and no expression.  He wanted expression.
Speaker 1: And what did that mean for you?  How did you call that forth?
Speaker 2: Well, I had to think very deeply about what I was doing.  In addition to technically being able to do it, I had to bring my own feelings to what it meant to be this person or what it meant to experience that this particular ballet was trying to convey to an audience.  And it was difficult.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was difficult because I could be very shy and so, but you were encouraged to, I guess like actors do, use subtext, you know, use your own experiences and Alvin always encouraged you to don't eat, sleep, and drink only dance.  You need to experience the arts.  You need to go to museums.  You need to be well read.  I mean, he was a prolific reader, incredibly well read.  You need to, you know, explore the other art forms.  You need to explore life.  We encourage that very much.
Speaker 1: And as he encouraged it, what did you do in following that direction?
Speaker 2: Well, I was always a film buff and I always loved reading.  Always.  And I always, I had always gone to museums of all kinds, art museums and galleries.  I had always known painters and photographers and, so you know, you surround yourself with those people and those environments that feed the senses and I think that's how I was able to sustain, you know, that passion and that love, and (pause)--and I loved people.  I was always interested in how you felt about something or how you did something.  I was always wanting to learn that.  I was always wanting to learn that.  I was always wanting to be better in myself.  I always wanted to attain enough information and knowledge, and to be in environments that would inform me as a, as a human being.  I wanted to learn.  I wanted, I wanted to be generous.  I wanted to be generous.  I'm not sure I was always generous enough.  I thought I was, but I always felt there was more, especially as a performer.
Speaker 1: And, you mentioned that you were somewhat shy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: At times, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm thinking of the ballets that I've seen of the Alvin Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] and they're, shy is not a word that would describe.  I mean there are--many of the characters are very bold and, and strong.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well sometimes when you, when you're, well what happens I think, as a performer and you inhabit these roles and you go on stage, there was a responsibility and there is a need, and there is that outlet for you to do this, to display your innermost, yeah, that becomes your, your world.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know.
Story_ID: 673263
Speaker 1: Did you perform with the company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] when they went to the White House [Washington, D.C.] in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: No.  That was just before I joined.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then in '69 [1969], Alvin Ailey established the school [The Ailey School] in Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  In the basement of a church [Hanson Place Central United Methodist Church, Brooklyn, New York], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how were, so you're part of the company.  Are you involved in the school at all?
Speaker 2: At that point I wasn't.
Speaker 1: But the school then becomes a way for him to identify and train dancers to potentially become part of the company--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were a constituent company at the Brooklyn Academy of Music [Brooklyn, New York] at that time.
Speaker 1: And what church was this where the school was started, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was next door to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, but I don't remember the name of the church.
Speaker 1: Then, in 1970 I see that the theater and school relocate to share a renovated church building with Pearl Lang.
Speaker 2: Yes, on East 59th Street.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So now, you're back to Manhattan [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  While the school was next to BAM, were you still rehearsing at the Y [Westside YWCA, New York, New York], though?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, BAM did not provide any rehearsal space or storage space or office space.
Speaker 1: So what was the relationship?
Speaker 2: We just performed there.  It was a venue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a good venue.
Speaker 2: That's basically what it was and Alvin was very disappointed about that relationship.
Speaker 1: Ah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were four other companies.  There was, I believe, Merce Cunningham and Eliot Feld and there was an opera company and I think there was supposed to be a theater company [Chelsea Theater Center].
Speaker 1: And they all had the same relationship, just p- so no internal support from the company, just venue.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How long did that relationship last?
Speaker 2: Roughly a year and a half, roughly, give or take.
Story_ID: 673264
Speaker 1: And that's when Alvin [Alvin Ailey] decided to disband the company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater].
Speaker 2: To disband the company?  So then--so this is what year?
Speaker 1: Nineteen--early 1970.
Speaker 2: So you've been with the company--
Speaker 1: We were announced, that was announced at the last performance at BAM [Brooklyn Academy of Music, Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 2: That the company's disbanding.  Well, did you know?
Speaker 1: No, we were in total shock.  I said, "What?  What are you talking about?  How could you?  Why?  I mean, hello.  No, no way.  Not with the success we're having and have had and will probably continue to have."  He said, "We cannot have a company and not pay the dancers.  We just can't do it."  He said, "I can't go on that way.  I refuse to go on that way."
Speaker 2: And why were there financial challenges that deep.
Speaker 1: There wasn't enough money coming in as to be able to meet expenses of running a dance company, plain and simple.  It's--there wasn't that much funding at the time.  That was kind of the beginning of funding, you know, New York State Council on the Arts, National Endowment [National Endowment for the Arts], that sort of thing.  So--
Speaker 2: So, so primarily you were relying on ticket sales.
Speaker 1: Well, the ticket sales, we were direct recipients of ticket sales.  There was a fee.  The company, I believe, was paid on a fee basis.  And the Brooklyn Academy [Brooklyn Academy of Music, Brooklyn, New York] performances were sold out.  I forget, it's a couple thousand seats in that opera house.
Speaker 2: So, the--
Speaker 1: So, and it wasn't just the Brooklyn Academy.  It was the touring.  Touring costs money.  It's expensive.  Anyhow, he just decided that--
Speaker 2: How many dancers were in the company?
Speaker 1: At that point, I think there were, I think there were fourteen.
Speaker 2: And you had been there for what?  About a year and a half?
Speaker 1: About two years, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: About two years. And--
Speaker 1: I mean, we were stunned.  We just, it just seemed like what?  We're just getting really going, you know.
Story_ID: 673265
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: How long did that last?
Speaker 1: Well, that lasted for a couple of months and apparently it was deliberate that press noticed that he release that press release, and what it did was the state department [U.S. Department of State] stepped in--
Speaker 2: The state department?
Speaker 1: --and there was tour to North Africa, which would provide the company with money for the rehearsal period to prepare for a tour of the Soviet Union, Paris [France], and London [England].  So--
Speaker 2: Do you know how that came to be, that the state department--
Speaker 1: Well, this one knew that one, somebody, you know, they--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: There were things going on behind the scenes that we obviously were not aware of and happily so.
Speaker 2: And in that two-month period did you work at all?
Speaker 1: I did.  I worked with, I worked with Fred Benjamin and I think that's about all I did.  I collected unemployment, I think (laughter).
Speaker 2: There's that unemployment.
Speaker 1: I can't remember, but there wasn't much going on, and then one day I was living on 11th Street.  The company manager, Bill Hammond--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  He was walking down the street and I said, "Bill, how you doing?"  And he had a big smile on his face.  I said, "What's going on?  Why are you so happy?"  He said, "You have to promise not to tell.  It hasn't been announced yet."  And that's when he told me about the tour--
Speaker 2: The state department?
Speaker 1: --yeah, the state department tour to North Africa, and the tour to the Soviet Union and Paris and London, Sadler Wells [sic. Sadler's Wells Theatre, London, England].
Story_ID: 673266
Speaker 1: You go, you prepare for this tour.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: So, so you get the call afterwards.  Bill Hammond tells you privately but then how soon after you--
Speaker 2: Soon, very soon after.  We all kind of buzzed on the phone with a, you know, "Can you keep a secret?"  Of course you couldn't keep a secret (laughter).  Everyone was so excited and so thrilled to be working and that all was not lost and we still didn't know that that was a deliberate ploy.  I didn't know that for years, but, and so we went to North Africa.  We started off at the Washington Monument [Washington, D.C.] for a performance and then we went to North Africa and that, I think we went, I don't know, like five weeks.  It was in June to July something.  I have the dates, I've looked at--
Speaker 1: Was the U.S.S.R. part of that tour or was that a separate--
Speaker 2: And then we came back, rehearsed, and we were rehearsing in our new home at 59th Street, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center [The Ailey School, New York, New York], it was called, and we rehearsed, I guess for about, I don't know, that whole summer, the rest of that summer, and we were going towards the end of September to Russia and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And this was historic.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We were the first modern dance company to go to the Soviet Union and so in preparation for that, you know, some of our programs had to be made longer because they were used to, you know, three and four acts of 'Swan Lake' [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky] and, anyhow, and we had to be, the repertory had to be approved.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So that we had to perform all of the works for the Russian cultural council [Ministry of Culture of the U.S.S.R.] for their approval before we could take any of these ballets and so we did a two or three day performance series at the Fashion Institute [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] for a free audience, so it was like quote unquote sold out every performance, and, you know full makeup and costume and everything for the Russians to see.
Speaker 1: So the Russians were here to see and to approve--
Speaker 2: Right.  What ballets would be suitable for their audiences or not.
Speaker 1: And was this also coordinated through the state department [U.S. Department of State]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So this is in the midst of the Cold War--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they are allowing, encouraging this.  This was really unusual.  Was it that the arts were leading?
Speaker 2: Well, the arts, yeah, tend to do that, yeah.  I mean Alvin [Alvin Ailey] did that when they went to Southeast Asia in 1962, and Brazil in 1963, you know, and other companies as well.
Speaker 1: So when you get to Russia, how were you received (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, first, there were some pieces that were not approved.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: There was one piece we did by [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder, 'Prodigal Prince' ['The Prodigal Prince'] that they objected to the costuming of the lead dancer, Miguel Godreau, which was a jeweled dance belt, and they said no way.  So, they wanted Miguel to wear tights and Geoffrey was furious, anyhow, and there was a solo ['Adagio for a Dead Soldier'] that Geoffrey had done for Judith [HistoryMaker Judith Jamison], it ended, it was about a soldier who had died in the war, and it ended with his uniform jacket on the back of the chair as she mourned and they felt that was just too political, so that was not accepted.
Speaker 1: Wow.  So the dance wasn't accepted?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Because--
Speaker 2: They felt the dance was political, yeah, and there was question about one other but that got a pass.
Story_ID: 673267
Speaker 1: Anyhow, we went and it was, it was fascinating.  It was fascinating, it was exciting, it was new.  You know, because you read things in the newspaper and then when you confront it with the reality, it's not at all the same thing.  People are people, you know?  And Russian audiences were extraordinarily enthusiastic, from the beginning.  And the first places we performed were in the Ukraine, like Donetsk [Ukraine] and Luhansk [Ukraine], so when I read about these places in the news today, I said, "Oh, it doesn't exist anymore?"  You know.  Anyhow, we were encouraged not to be too social with the locals and avoid political chit chat, you know, that sort of thing, and manners and, you know, being--your behavior in the host country and--
Speaker 2: And, so did you all socialize with them at all?
Speaker 1: Not to a very great degree.  It depended the city, you know, at times.  You know, we were given tours and show this and shown that, where to go.  We were fed some of the most horrible food, you know.  We were hungry for much of that tour.  It's not that they starved us.  It's just that the diet was so different, you know, a lot of heavy food, a lot of cabbage, my favorite was--oh goodness, I can't remember--chicken, this wonderful chicken dish, and it was the first time I had ever had flavored water, fruit water, and there was lots of vodka (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: This is 1970.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So we went to six cities and the third city, let me see, the third city I think was Kiev [Ukraine], and I remembered there we met a lot of the dancers from the Kiev Ballet [Kiev National Ballet], and we did have a party with them and they, you know, were very sociable and fun and then Moscow [Russia], mind you the audiences were like unbelievable--I mean, our bows, our curtain calls were very, very long.  When we would leave the theater, those who were ushers in the theater and firemen doubled as policemen outside of the theater, you know, so people were going to get on the bus.  There were crowds of people there to just shake your hand and--
Speaker 2: Who were the principal dancers at this time?
Speaker 1: It was a company of principals.  Everybody was considered a principal.
Speaker 2: Everybo- okay.  That was always true?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I mean, you became principal by virtue of what you did.  I mean, certainly Judith [HistoryMaker Judith Jamison] was Alvin's muse.  He did lots of works on her, but he did works on other people as well, and Dudley [Dudley Williams].
Speaker 2: And was he dancing?
Speaker 1: Alvin [Alvin Ailey], no.  Not at this--Alvin stopped dancing in '64 [1964] or '65 [1965].  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So at this point he's really running this company.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And choreographing, right?
Speaker 1: And, you know, like I said, we were like a family.  I mean, Sara Yarborough was with the company, Mari Kajiwara, Dudley, of course, Miguel Godreau, Consuelo Atlas, beautiful dancers; I mean, you were just in good company.  You felt that.  I mean, when I first met Judy in Paris [France], Mary Barnett said, "Oh, have you met Judy," and Judith turned around and she said, "Judith."  And I was reminded of that because when I joined the company, I know I'm straying from the topic a little (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: When I, the first day walking to rehearsal, we met on the sidewalk, and she said, "Oh, hi."  You know, she was so welcoming and so open and we've been best of friends ever since, really, and I remind her of Judith.  She said, "I don't remember that."  I said, "I do" (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's funny.  So, you all are rescued by the state department [U.S. Department of State].  You have these two different tours.
Story_ID: 673268
Speaker 1: When you come back from the Soviet Union, what's next?
Speaker 2: Well, the success of that just rang, shot around the world and we performed at the ANTA Theatre [August Wilson Theatre, New York, New York], which was really the beginning of the company's longevity at City Center [New York City Center, New York, New York].  That was the beginning.  It started with performances at the ANTA.
Speaker 1: At--at which?
Speaker 2: ANTA Theatre.
Speaker 1: And where is that? At City?
Speaker 2: That was at 52nd Street.  We hadn't moved into City Center as yet.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: And the tours, bus and truck.
Speaker 1: So, so the, the performance at the ANTA Theatre, was this around holiday time.  Is that how it started?
Speaker 2: I think it was, it proceeded a tour.  I think it was in January, for a week or two weeks, and then a very long tour, and our tours at that point were one nighters until the National Endowment [National Endowment for the Arts] started to fund the tours and that way we didn't have to do one nighters anymore.  You could stay in a community for two or three days, doing, in addition to performances, classes and workshops and, you know, residencies and it made touring less strenuous.  We still travelled by bus most of the time, occasionally by plane but mostly by bus.
Speaker 1: And, are you going across the whole country?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What, what do you remember what that, what the stops were on that tour?
Speaker 2: Not on that tour in particular.
Speaker 1: But just in ge- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I mean, what, Iowa, Des Moines; Ames, Iowa; Cooksville, Missouri [sic. Cookville, Missouri]; oh, my god.  I can't think of a state we haven't been to.
Speaker 1: Wow.  So, you're touring and then coming back to the ANTA theatre, is that how it's working now?
Speaker 2: I think we came back and opened at City Center.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So by, is this now 1971?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now, in 1973, I see you dancing a premiere of 'Hidden Rights' [Alvin Ailey].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was noteworthy about 'Hidden Rites'?
Speaker 2: It was based on ritual, all kinds of ritual, and the music was a percussion score by Patrice Sciortino, and it was very, there was a character, a figure who was like in- invoking the gods for, invoking the gods for replenishment of the earth.  There was a sacrificial, there was a section about ritual male, female relationships.  You know, it was all about ritual.
Story_ID: 673269
Speaker 1: In that same year, '73 [1973], you had your son.
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1: Oh, '72 [1972], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you were married then to Chauncey Jones?
Speaker 2: Not yet.
Speaker 1: Not yet, okay.
Speaker 2: Not yet.
Speaker 1: But, you did marry him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so your son is Kenya [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And he was a gift, I felt, and he toured (laughter) with me.  It was very difficult.  He toured with me and, you know, and to have Alvin [Alvin Ailey], Alvin having given me a maternity leave which was unheard of in those days.  I mean, that in itself was a gift, and--
Speaker 1: And I guess it had to be longer than a traditional one because did you dance while you were pregnant?  And showing?
Speaker 2: Up until five months, but we were doing the Bernstein [Leonard Bernstein] 'Mass' at that time, so I was an acolyte on the podium.  He said the acolytes won't be doing much, but we had lots of movement, lots of movement (laughter) and then I did a short tour with them to Bermuda and the morning sickness just didn't stop so, you know.  But I took off, of course, several months and I returned to the company the following spring.
Speaker 1: Were you the first one to have a child as part of the company (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, everybody's figuring it out.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, and there were many babysitters.  They were wonderful, but it was difficult.  It was difficult on him.  It was difficult on me, and thank goodness for grandparents, you know.  It was hard.  It was hard.  And it was, you know, to be away from him was just as hard as him being there, so at a certain point I knew I was coming to the conclusion of that chapter in my life.
Speaker 1: The performance chapter.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I think.  I don't think.  I, I lived in the moment, you know.  That was the thing.  I didn't think ahead well.  I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that.  I anticipated going into theater and teaching and, and that's when Alvin invited me to be director of the second company [Alvin Ailey Repertory Dance Ensemble; Ailey II] and I did that--
Speaker 1: So did you think that you were going to have to leave the company when you started contemplating?
Speaker 2: I didn't know what I was going to do.  I remember having a conversation with him that I felt very schizophrenic about.  You know, I wanted to give my utmost as a parent, and I wanted to certainly give my utmost as an artist and was it possible to do both, and I knew I couldn't travel that much, and he had tried to make all kinds of ways for me to travel; "I'll bring you to California and bring your mother [Brittannia Hall Waters] and they can stay with my mother [Lula Cooper]," and he was just totally, totally, you know, giving and such generosity of spirit and all-inclusiveness.  It was wonderful, but I knew I had to, you know, when you have a child, I don't know if you have children--
Speaker 1: I do.
Speaker 2: --but that very moment how that changes everything (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Everything, um-hm.
Speaker 2: It, you know, that becomes the priority, and so--
Story_ID: 673270
Speaker 1: And he, he started the, what was then the Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  That was my name for it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Which is now Ailey II, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that started in '74 [1974]--
Speaker 2: He didn't want it to be Ailey II at that time.
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: He didn't.  I don't know.  Well, we went back and forth about it.
Speaker 1: That was in '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '75 [1975] actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It started in '74 [1974] under the directorship of another person that Alvin [Alvin Ailey] worked with, Karina Rieger, who assisted him on many, you know, projects because Alvin was doing several commissions on other companies, primarily ballet companies and, but he and Karina felt it should be someone from within the company.
Speaker 1: And, and what was the purpose of the Repertory Ensemble?
Speaker 2: Well, it was to train emerging artists, to train young dancers, what it was like to be in a company, what it was like to learn repertory, what it was like to work with different choreographers, what it was like to perform, what it was like to perform in different spaces, what it was like to do photo calls, what it was like to be a professional dancer, to train dancers, to help them make that, that bridge from the classroom to the stage.
Speaker 1: And, in the beginning was it to be more like school than touring?
Speaker 2: Yeah, our, our main thrust was education and we were performing, doing a lot of outreach, you know, for communities that were, where the arts were not available, so we would go to them, so we performed in correctional facilities, lots of them, homes for seniors, homes for the disabled of all kinds, it was mostly outreach and education and schools, of course.
Speaker 1: So, these outlets became places where they could show their work.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they honed their skills as performers.
Speaker 1: And then how was it funded?
Speaker 2: Originally funded by a very generous grant from the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], and--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I'm sure you weren't, these places where you were performing were not paying.
Speaker 2: Well, not paying a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a generous grant from the Ford Foundation at the outset, and then development began to write grants from others, so New York State arts council [New York State Council on the Arts] began to fund it, various private foundations, and over time the funding increased.  We got also funding from National Endowment [National Endowment for the Arts] and the company was so skilled and so polished.
Story_ID: 673271
Speaker 1: I mean, Alvin [Alvin Ailey] invited us to be, to participate in the 'Ailey Celebrates Ellington' bicentennial in 1976, so the assignment was for any choreographer that I invited to choreograph for the company.  The one stipulation would be that the music be by Duke Ellington.  So, we did that and I invited [HistoryMaker] Gus Solomons jr, Cristyne Lawson, Milton Myers--oh, goodness, I see his--Raymond Sawyer, and Alvin McDuffie, and I also invited some designers like Willi Smith to do the costumes and [HistoryMaker] Alvin Bell, so you had this marriage of, you know, production, choreography, and it was presented at the theater of the Riverside Church [New York, New York], and one of the ballets was presented with the Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] at State Theater [New York State Theater; David H. Koch Theater, New York, New York], you know, tucked into the Ailey programming.  That was Gus Solomons' ballet, 'Forty,' to live music--
Speaker 2: And Gus Solomons was in the main company or--
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  He has his own company [Solomons Company Dance].  He had his own company.  At this time, he had his own company.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So, the dancer you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: He never danced with the Ailey company.
Speaker 2: The dancer that you just mentioned that--
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm sorry.  He's from Merce Cunningham.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That was one of the companies he was from.  He danced with [HistoryMaker] Donald McKayle and several others too, but not with Ailey.
Speaker 2: And so for this performance, when you, the people you named were outside of the Ailey company who you were invited to be part of this special performance.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There were choreographers, Milton Myers finally did join the Ailey company as a dancer, and he is now a choreographer, renowned teacher of the Horton technique.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So you brought all of these people together.  The performance was at the Riverside Church where, at the time there was a space that was used regularly for performance, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we did a week there and it was thought by Columbia Artists Management [Columbia Artists Management, Inc.] who was booking the first company's tours, the question was would this company be able to tour?  Oh, [HistoryMaker] Dianne McIntyre--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --was another one.  That's right.
Story_ID: 673272
Speaker 1: Columbia Artists Management [Columbia Artists Management, Inc.], they asked if you would tour.  This is when the question came.
Speaker 2: Yes, and it was decided, let me see.  It was Ed Landa [ph.] who was our executive director, and Alvin [Alvin Ailey] decided that it was a possibility because there was such an overflow of bookings for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in the colleges throughout the United States that they weren't able to fulfill.  Plus, they were getting too big for these venues.  The company at this point must have been twenty-five dancers, almost thirty dancers.  It had, you know, it increased the size of the company very rapidly.
Speaker 1: What year are we talking now?
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975], '76 [1976]; '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: So this is at the beginning of the Repertory Ensemble [Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble; Ailey II].
Speaker 2: Yeah, '75 [1975]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and--
Speaker 2: --is when I started.
Speaker 1: Right, and so shortly after you start is when this invitation, question comes, about touring--
Speaker 2: Yeah, about a year and a half after.  And--also, it was the hope and aspiration of these dancers to be members of the first company, and you know, hopefully that this training with the second company would prepare them for that, would give them a kind of inside track, if you want, and they had to audition along with the rest of the world for any position in the first company, and that exists to this day.
Speaker 1: And, the--so this second company, each year is twelve members, correct?
Speaker 2: At one point it was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then it went back to twelve (laughter).
Speaker 1: So why twelve?
Speaker 2: It seemed like a good number.  For a school as large as it is, maybe it should be more dancers to have an opportunity, but budgetarily it just hasn't been feasible.
Speaker 1: And, so, so how, structurally how does it work?  How long is the time that they're in the company?
Speaker 2: A dancer stays minimum one year, maximum two, occasionally if it's felt that it's needed, a third year.
Speaker 1: And what is the expectation in that time?
Speaker 2: The expectation is to grow and develop as a performer, as an artist, as a human being.  These are usually dancers, you know, just on the cusp of their maturity.  They're just out of adolescence, some of them still adolescent.  And, learning repertory, improving their skills, honing their abilities to perform, to communicate with audiences, learning to teach, preparing for futures in dance.  Or I'd rather say, preparing for futures, not all of them will go into dance, will continue beyond this, but the track record has been really remarkable; I would say 80 percent have continued to pursue dance careers and have had successful careers.
Speaker 1: And where are most of these students coming from?  How do you find them?
Speaker 2: All over the United States, all over the world.
Story_ID: 673273
Speaker 1: This position of artistic director when Alvin [Alvin Ailey] proposed it to me, I wasn't enthusiastic at first; I mean, I knew I was, I had to make a decision about my future and I said I would think about it.  I, I was terrified, the responsibility of it, because I had never thought of myself as a director or, you know, and being responsible for other peoples' lives, young lives, and, you know nurturing in that respect.  But, I thought about it for about overnight (laughter), and it seems like the ideal transition and still stay within the field and still remain with the company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater], still remain very close to the company and have an important or necessary part to play, and I did realize it was a gift and his trust in me to do this was very, was very moving to me.  I took him very seriously and he was, he gave me courage and he was very mentoring himself, and very nurturing, always had been.  So, but the first few moments I was not gung ho.  I was, and he almost felt apologetic.  He said, "Now, I don't want you to stop dancing."  I said, "Where am I gonna dance?  Not with these kids, certainly."  As it turned out, I did dance on occasion with the company, you know, when they needed and someone may have been injured or ill.  On occasion, that happened, you know, so.
Speaker 2: And how did you feel about transitioning out of dancing?  Because, I mean, you, there's this fear about moving into this new role but was there any mourning internally about stepping away from--
Speaker 1: Well, I never thought I'd stop moving and I didn't.  I continued to take class, I taught, I taught repertory, so I continued to move.  So, I didn't hunger for that, and it made my, it gave my body rest and healing.  You know, I was fortunate not to have had any great serious injuries.  I always had trouble with my back, you know, sciatica, that sort of thing, and then you began to do this cross training with these therapies and what not, and the yoga and the pilates and so I was still learning a lot about my body, though I wasn't actively performing, but if I was asked to perform at that time, I would have--I was ready to.

Speaker 1: I spoke to one of your former dancers and then, who worked there, Yvette Campbell?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who described how you would come in on the first day to teach 'Revelations' [Alvin Ailey]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know.  What did she tell you?
Speaker 1: Well, she described that you came in costume for, this was her recollection, for the first day of Ailey, what is now called the Ailey II [Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble; Ailey II]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to teach, to teach them a part of 'Revelations' and that her experience was that it was so dramatic and, you know, inspiring and also scary for the dancers to tap--to step up immediately, and she also said that you taught 'Revelations' the way that Mr. Ailey [Alvin Ailey] taught 'Revelations,' which actually the first company had changed it up a little bit so that there were--yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, it's always evolving--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.
Speaker 2: --it's always evolving, but I could give them information directly from him and I didn't appear in costume.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: That's exaggerated (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's wha- she remembered that.  Who knows?
Speaker 2: I would, maybe I would, teaching the yellow section or the end section (unclear), I would use the fan.  They would learn how to use the fan.  I mean we layered it as they went along.  Then, they, you know, once they learned it, they'd wear the costumes, working the costume, the hat, and everything.  But the first thing, one of the first things was learning to use the fan.
Speaker 1: Which is very dramatic in 'Revelations' (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, as you're teaching, all these dances you were taught by Mr. Ailey, correct?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are you the, the teacher, are there other teachers?
Speaker 2: Oh, there are other, I mean Judith [HistoryMaker Judith Jamison], Masazumi Chaya, and now there are many, many, you know, there are several dancers in the Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] who have taken on the responsibility of transferring material.
Speaker 1: To, to Ailey II.
Speaker 2: No, to Ailey I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also some of them to Ailey II, yeah.  Sometimes I still do that.  And sometimes there are dancers from the first company and there are dancers who have worked with the second company and who have left to do other things; have come back to be rehearsal directors and they can also have that ability and responsibility of transferring material, and thank goodness there are, there are videos.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But you really can't learn it all from the video, and then we always say, "Well, I didn't do it that way." "Well it's this way and that way," there's always that that goes on.
Story_ID: 673275
Speaker 1: What would you consider to be your biggest challenge in running the second company [Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble; Ailey II]?
Speaker 2: Keeping it alive, keeping it viable, being realistic, being, being honest, having the integrity, transferring what it is to have integrity as an artist and--and encouraging dancers to really trust their instincts and investigate their- investigate the material to the point where you really are mastering the art.  You know, they grow to be artists.  You're not an artist when you start.  That's the process of evolvement and also always trying to be open and communicative with them and holding them to their highest, you know, that they, that I believe in them, and sometimes it seems like I believe in them more than they believe in themselves, I mean, we can be very vulnerable as artists, and so I'm there to really help them do better what they already do very well.  And, having, you know, being a curator, identifying choreographers and works that will help them in the growing process, that will help them achieve and that will help them strengthen, you know, their abilities, that will help, that will challenge them, that will open their spirits and their minds, that will (pause), that will also appeal to audiences so that they have this language, this wonderful expressive language in their bodies and in their temperaments, and that it is transferrable to audiences who are receptive to it.  So keeping that communication going and just being able to identify all of these processes or processi (laughter), you know, and to keep it, to have them accomplish that continuity of life and spirit through what they do.
Speaker 1: So, with all of that in mind, in the, you, you ran the second company--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: A long time.
Speaker 1: --for a long time, how many years?
Speaker 2: Thirty-eight.
Speaker 1: So, thirty-eight years?  What, how did you keep it fresh for you?
Speaker 2: Living in the moment, dreaming and trying to move into the future, seeing a lot of work, not just dance works, music works.  I mean, constantly it's a constant reeducation and people keeping that kind of, you know, spirit and contact with people, not just your peers, not just your colleagues, but people that you meet.  Being receptive and really having dancers learn that their openness and their receptiveness is going to make them better and bigger communicators, because basically that's what they are.  They have a natural language.  It's a, it's a visceral experience.
Story_ID: 673276
Speaker 1: As you were building the second company [Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble; Ailey II], you mentioned that there was a, there, there was the question about touring.  The company began to tour early on.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (Cough) And as you grew, strengthened the company, what was the touring schedule like?  How did it evolve?
Speaker 2: Well in the beginning, a tour would be maybe a couple of weeks, and then that grew into a couple of months, you know, and so it varied, it varied, but then you were touring twice a year, you know, spring and fall, a season, a home season in New York [New York], sometimes at, it started in the Riverside Church [New York, New York] for a very long time, then Aaron Davis Hall at City College [City College of New York, New York, New York], which was a bigger venue, and then our own theater, the Ailey Citigroup Theater [New York, New York], and sometimes at the Joyce Theater [New York, New York], and now the company since 2008, has been doing a lot of European touring.  So, the dancers have had to step up to the plate; I mean, and their level of sophistication is just amazing and, so, to secure all of that as you go, you know, you're always building a repertory that I said would challenge them, will also reflect their gifts and talents to the audiences and will communicate to audiences who they are, their individuality, themselves as a group of very passionate, purposeful communicators of life.  It's a life force and you want to keep that life force going and the things that are relevant to do that give them the tools to master who they are, these gifts that they have.
Speaker 1: Now, how did, what is the vetting process like to even choose these twelve dancers, because as--
Speaker 2: It's very competitive, yeah.  (Pause) That's always been hard for me to define.  I mean, of course you look forward to dancing with good facility and musicality and how they respond to correction and just, and how they absorb material and then what they do with it, how they give it back to you, how they carry, what they think of themselves, you know, and what their strengths are and how they shore up what their weaknesses are.  It's difficult because you're looking at physical person but you're also looking for something from within.  You know, it's--I've never found the right words for it, but you want someone who has a compassion for, I don't know, for, or the senses, you know, who can sense whe- you can sense their humanity and what they feel about themselves.  Yes, they have to have an ego, but humility at the same time, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 673277
Speaker 1: In the midst of your developing the second company [Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble; Ailey II], Mr. Ailey [Alvin Ailey] dies in 1989, correct?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This was, I guess at the height of the AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] crisis in New York [New York] and certainly in the arts community.  What happened internally with the company?  I know, you were very much involved in handling his estate, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was his executor much to my surprise.  Although in retrospect he had tried to relate this to me.
Speaker 1: So you learned after he died?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's a big job.
Speaker 2: Yes it was. Daunting.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: How long did it take you to handle everything?
Speaker 2: About five years.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, up until a couple of, a few months before he died, we didn't know how sick he was.  We knew something was not right, but no one was giving it a name, so it wasn't just that we were in some kind of denial, but they weren't giving it a name.  They weren't saying out right, forthright, this is, in fact, it wasn't even on the death certificate that it was age related.  That was changed.  So, it left, Alvin had prepared in many ways.  He had, first of all, built--I mean, he was a visionary, he was a genius and he had built a company to endure, you know.  Like I said, it was never a single choreographer's company.  It was always a repertory company.  He invited scores of, of choreographers and musicians to help build his company and the repertoire it has, and these dancers.  I remember once having a conversation with him in the early '80s [1980s], talking about, you know, "I've always thought this company could drop the name Alvin Ailey and just be the American Dance Theater, because I've always thought of it as an American Dance Theater, you know, celebrating the African American heritage and the modern dance tradition."  And, I said, "Where would you go?"  He said, "Well, I may go into the hills of California and learn to play the recorder and write my book.  I may live in Paris [France] for a couple of years and come back every now and then and do a ballet."  I said, "Really?"  I mean, I just, I was astounded.  I couldn't imagine.  I couldn't imagine him not being there.  And, he said, "I always thought Judith [HistoryMaker Judith Jamison] would be the natural inheritor to the direction of this company."  I said, "Yeah, I could see how you'd say that."  By that time, she had left the company.  She was doing 'Sophisticated Lady' [sic. 'Sophisticated Ladies'], she was doing, then went on to the Jamison Project.  It's, you know.  But I remember that conversation and it frightened me, because I had never given it a thought of him not being there or the company not existing and, you know, and we've had that conversation a couple of times and at that time, I don't think he was ill but because AIDS was such an epidemic, maybe he thought it could possibly happen to him very well, so, very easily so.
Story_ID: 673278
Speaker 1: So, when it did come to pass, he put certain things in place.  He had acquired ownership of his ballets and he left a will and it was my duties to carry out the designations of that will.  The company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] did purchase the ballets from his mother, Mrs. Lula Cooper, and finally the name and the rites to--everything from his brother, Calvin Cooper [Calvin Walls Cooper].  Of course, needless to say, I mean, we were in deep despair for a very long time and wanted to really strive to keep this company on the ascendancy as Alvin [Alvin Ailey] had obviously intended, and his genius to, I mean, he left the ground rules.  He left the ground plan for it.  We just had to follow that, and he was always encouraging to bring your own personal and professional voice to what you did, and I feel that Judith [HistoryMaker Judith Jamison] did that and she trusted all of us.
Speaker 2: So had he, he asked her to come--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: On board, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --on board before he passed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It became official after he passed, but he had approached her, maybe a few months before, and she, I remember she came on tour, she went on tour with the company, you know, when it was the last tour he did and plus we had a new home on West 61st Street, which he never saw.  He only saw it when it was it raw space.  He never saw the finished--
Speaker 2: So which home was this now?
Speaker 1: At 211 West 61st Street [New York, New York].  We started off with four studios and grew within ten years to nine studios, took the space upstairs and we're considering buying the building, leasing the space or buying the space, and then the post office decided they were gonna move in and didn't know when they were gonna move out, and Judy said to the board, "We need a building.  We can't do this."  Because we've done a prospectus and everything for, this was in 2001, I guess, 2000, 2001, and so the board, we had people on our board that were in real estate, looked for a site and the irony of this 405 West 55th Street [New York, New York], it used to be on that site a PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] studio, but before that it was a CBS studio and I believe that's where Alvin did his first television show, 'Lamp Unto My Feet.'  So, once they acquired that space, tore down that building, and I had also done a television show there for CBS with [HistoryMaker] Donald McKayle, 'They Called Her Moses,' and anyhow, what we have now is with Judith calls our glass palace, and adding two more floors to it.
Story_ID: 673279
Speaker 1: If you look from the beginning of the company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Company] to whe- where it has evolved to, I mean the wall that lists all of the patrons, it's a whole wall.  It's a big wall.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a tremendous amount of support for the company, financial support and brain power and, and all of that.  In the art world that's not the most common story.
Speaker 2: No, especially for a black dance company; well, I don't call it a black dance company but its founder is a man of color--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, and people think of it as a black dance company--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Alvin [Alvin Ailey], he always said a company needs a home, and I really believe I don't, he may not have envisioned it to this extent, but I think he, this was part of his plan, you know.  I do believe that, and he has nurtured that plan and idea all of his adult life.   He saw the necessity of it, he saw the necessity of outreach and like he's often quoted, "The dance belongs to the people, it should be given back to the people."  You know, he comes from a very profound humanistic and spiritual place, and there is such a depth of reality in that.  It's what we all are.  It's what we all live, (pause) or try to, you know.
Speaker 1: And so now, in that building is the school [The Ailey School, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: And many programs--
Speaker 1: Many programs.
Speaker 2: The Fordham, the Ailey Fordham [Ailey/Fordham BFA Program] where a dancer can get a degree in four years, a certificate program, a foreign student program and many incarnations of that, a junior division, a children's division, the, it's a place for everyone to come and dance.  If you can walk, you can dance, you know, and they have a very successful adult program, and I mean, it's- and it's just, you know, the seams are bursting.  It's a very successful school and--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: No, and a very successful company.  Beautiful dancers, the dancers work hard, the dancers give their all.  It's where they want to be.  I feel I've had the best of all worlds, really, working with Alvin.  I always think there are so many questions I didn't get to ask him, out of what reason I don't know, whether I was shy, I don't know.  And it's interesting working in archives.  He used to always have a notebook.  He was always writing in notebooks, and I've been annotating those notebooks, and through those notebooks, some of my questions have been answered, some of them.
Story_ID: 673280
Speaker 1: You know, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So, you left the company but you're back in a different kind of way, working on the archive (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Different capacity, yes.  I've been doing, I've been doing residencies in college and university dance departments, called The Ailey Legacy [The Ailey Legacy College Residency].  It started at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when I was a visiting professor.
Speaker 2: When was that?
Speaker 1: In 2010, and then--
Speaker 2: And then 2010 is when you left the company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]?
Speaker 1: Yes, but I was doing this while I was still with the company, and I do it with two colleagues, alternating, Elizabeth Roxas and Ana Marie Forsythe, and it's a combination of repertory, lecture and Horton technique, and in addition to that I've been working on oral history, Dr. Guido Goldman, who was board member of long stature, provided the funding for this, to do this oral history and I've been interviewing dancers and musicians and choreographers and production people that knew Alvin [Alvin Ailey], that worked with Alvin, and hopefully this will go to the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.], where Alvin's papers are, and I do workshops in the school and, so I have various tasks and duties and things to keep me busy and I am still very much connected.
Story_ID: 673281
Speaker 1: I'd like to go back to the second company [Ailey II]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --which you built for thirty-eight years (laughter).  So over that time you've had many, many graduates because there are twelve new ones each time, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you--
Speaker 2: Well no, it's overlapping.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: It's overlapping every year; you know, three leave, four leave, sometimes six leave.  It depends on a given year.
Speaker 1: I see.  And so, what happens with those dancers?  You mentioned that they have to audition just like everybody else--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they all audition and sometimes very often they get in.
Speaker 1: To the first one--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would say about 60, 65 percent of the first company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] comes from the second company.  I'm very proud of that.
Speaker 1: And then, what percentage from the school [The Ailey School, New York, New York] come into the second?  Because I know there's some of the students who were in school are headed toward a professional career in dancing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't know the exact percentage number, but a great many, a great many who have trained at the school.
Speaker 1: So that vision that Mr. Ailey [Alvin Ailey] had from the beginning of teaching young people from a very young age to come right up through is happening--
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: And who are some of the shining examples of graduates of the second company?
Speaker 2: Desmond Richardson, who now is, was director of Complexions dance company [Complexions Contemporary Ballet], plus he's been a Broadway star, he's a teaching star, he's, he's--amazing artist; Sarita Allen; currently Jamar Roberts; Jacqueline Green; Rachael McLaren.  (Pause) Names--
Speaker 1: Well, it's a lot of years too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Oh, Yannick Lebrun.
Speaker 1: And these people, as they leave, obviously 60 percent come into the first company, but how many--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the company the percentage of second company dancers in the first company are 60 percent.
Speaker 1: Ah, thank you for clarifying that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What percentage of the rest go on to be involved professionally in dance?
Speaker 2: I think I said about 80 to 85 percent, but then there are others who become doctors, lawyers, teachers, any number of fields they go into; actors.
Story_ID: 673282
Speaker 1: You left, officially anyhow, in 2010, and that was a time when there was a lot of change at Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater].  Wasn't it around that time, didn't [HistoryMaker] Judith Jamison step down then?
Speaker 2: Oh, she stepped down in 2010.  I stepped down in 2012.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So in a, so then she--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And then Sharon Luckman [Sharon Gersten Luckman]--
Speaker 1: Right.  Who's role--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Executive director, stepped down in 2013.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And the heads of the school chang- well there was one--
Speaker 2: Well, Denise Jefferson, she passed away.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So, now all of the leadership is male.
Speaker 2: Ironically, isn't that something?  Yes.  [HistoryMaker] Robert Battle, Bennett Rink, executive director, yeah; Troy Powell, who had been a member of Ailey II.  He came in with ArtsConnection at fourteen years old, and then at seventeen years old, I took him into the Ailey company and then at twenty, he went into the first company for ten years, then he came back to Ailey II as resident choreographer, then associate.  And, now he's artistic director of Ailey II.
Speaker 1: So he replaced you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your student.  Why did you decide to leave at that time?
Speaker 2: It was time, it was time.  Thirty-eight years, and mind you, that's thirty-eight years plus the time I was in the company.  That's a good run.  And I felt that it needed a different voice.  I felt that that was important for its continuity and it was time, and you know my mother [Brittannia Hall Waters] said don't overstay your time, you know, our mothers have told us that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Don't overstay your welcome.
Speaker 2: Right, don't overstay your welcome, so I hope that I didn't overstay my welcome.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 673283
Speaker 1: When you look at your many years at Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater], what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I want to think that I have given the best of myself, my abilities, my knowledge, and hopefully wisdom to help create, to be part of the creation of some extraordinarily beautiful artists.  I, I like to feel that I have participated in a beautiful sport, which transcends all of our differences and really brings out more of our, more of what we have in common with each other.  I just feel that our humanity is so much at the fore of what we do and who we are and I want to have given to, with great passion, this very, very beautiful art form and how it, you know, fits into the, the cosmos, this totality of our existence, you know.  I've been, I feel I've been so fortunate.  I mean, I have a mother [Brittannia Hall Waters] who's going to turn 100 in December.
Speaker 1: Oh, God bless her.
Speaker 2: You know.  And, I found out late in my career that she had really wanted to be a dancer, and auditioned for [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham, but didn't take it because she had gotten married and couldn't tour, and she hadn't studied dance.  She just danced, you know.  Anyhow, I don't know, when I meet up with former dancers and students now who consider me mentor, they know they can always ask me to help them, to help guide them, and I always want to be able to give them the best guidance and career.  I mean, I find that young people don't listen.  They have to, you know, figure it out for themselves no matter what you tell them.  Through my son I know that, (laughter) you know.  And that can be very frustrating, but you have to let them be who they are, and guide (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 673284
Speaker 1: If any of them see this and hear you, what advice would you give to a young dancer who is starting the journey?
Speaker 2: Pursue what you love to do, pursue what you are good at, give yourself a chance to find out what that is and pursue it with the greatest passion.  Money after success is very important, but what's more important is your happiness and your sense of reality and your sense of yourself, hard work, the rest will come, and I feel that I've worked very hard and I've been very positive.  I mean, my parents [Brittannia Hall Waters and Benjamin Waters], both of them, gave me a reason to be positive; you know, like growing up in Harlem [New York, New York], I never felt I was growing up in a ghetto.  I lived on a beautiful street, you know, and I didn't feel the strains of what some people are even going through now.  You know, I always embraced other people, other cultures, and I would encourage people to do that, young people to do that.  It's important.  We were all on this earth together, and we look at a world today that is in such disarray and so many wars and so much hostility and we won't even talk about our current (laughter) situation here, but I'm a believer in humanity and I still get a positive vibe from the earth, I still do.
Story_ID: 673285
Speaker 1: As you look back on your life, is there anything that you regret?
Speaker 2: Some things I could have worked harder at.  Some decisions I should have thought more about instead of, the, the passion, I should have thought them through.  Some mistakes, I have been able to correct, but there are certain things I should have, I mean when you have a jewel, you have to polish it, you have to take care of it, and that's what I tried to do and I wish, you know, I had tried to do certain things more in that direction, and I ask myself all the time, if I were coming up now, would I decide to be a dancer, and I probably would.  If I had the energy that I had and have, probably so, but I'd probably also be a singer too, and an actress and everything else, you know.
Speaker 1: So you are continuing.  You have a lot of things that you are doing now.  What do you see yourself doing in the next few years?
Speaker 2: I'm asking myself that now.  I'm asking myself.  Right now, I'm paying a lot of attention to my mom [Brittannia Hall Waters].
Speaker 1: And you recently got married, didn't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  An old school friend; how things come around.  But, right now my mom is the priority and I think I have to, it's in my nature to stay busy to an extent that I think you want to remain relevant and I don't think that's an ego thing but I think that's an age thing.  I think that's about maturity, your relevance.  Your relevance.  I love my friends.  I love having friends and I love my friends, and I love all those dancers that I've worked with and even the ones I haven't worked with, and my Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] family and my dance family, and it's been, you know, a very, very real part of my existence.  So, I don't know what's next when I grow up (laughter).  I don't know, you know.  I hope I make good choices and I hope I'm continued to be blessed.  Just keep buying those lottery tickets, now (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (Cough) Pardon me, is there anything that you would like to share that I have not asked you?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I'm not a grandmother yet, and--
Speaker 1: Kenya [ph.], are you listening (laughter)?
Speaker 2: --I throw that question out to the universe, you know, so, what can I say?  It would be nice.
Speaker 1: Something to look forward to.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you (simultaneous).
