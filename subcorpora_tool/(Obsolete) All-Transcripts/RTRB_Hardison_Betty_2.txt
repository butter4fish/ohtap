SELVIDGE: This is our second tape. Sarah Selvidge with Betty Hardison, on
July 14. Okay, now the floor is yours.

HARDISON: Well, back when we were in Atchison Village. I did not drive yet. I
tried to learn on our honeymoon, and that’s not the time to learn to drive. So
I wasn’t driving. So I walked from Atchison Village up about eight to ten
blocks and did my shopping at a little Greek grocery story on Macdonald Avenue.
And that was fun. I got acquainted with the owner of the grocery, and he was
very nice. And for recreation, all we had were our neighbors or our church. And
the First Presbyterian Church had a young couples club, so we became part of
that, and that was our whole social life. We did crazy things together, skits
and potlucks, and I have more [SS1]old-fashioned casserole recipes that we
exchanged. Or we would go to each other’s houses. Certain couples we became
more acquainted with. We’d single out and get together separately. But it was
always just a “you go to my house and I’ll go to yours” kind of thing.

SELVIDGE: So it wasn’t so much like theaters or entertainment venues in Richmond.

HARDISON: We did not do movies much, no. They were too full of people sleeping.
And Don worked a lot at night, so most of our activity was at church on the
weekend or whatever. But I was always interested in the arts and crafts of some
kind, so I found an art center. And I must’ve done it on Saturday. I was
thinking the other day, I’m sure it wasn’t a weekday that I went, and I
don’t think I went alone at night, so I must’ve gone on a Saturday. It was
upstairs above a store, where a group were teaching different crafts. And I took
ceramics, and met the lady that inspired all of it, Hanjel Salmi. And then it
became the Richmond Art Center. I don’t know if you’ve heard of the Richmond
Art Center --

SELVIDGE: I have.

HARDISON:  -- but it is now a well known place.

SELVIDGE: Yeah, absolutely. So those were its early days.

HARDISON: I was there in the early days. And the very first ceramics teacher was
my teacher. And so I learned the different methods of making pots. Most all of
them are all broken and gone now. But through that relationship, I met this nice
lady that was so determined to bring an art center to the community. And Don
being an architectural graduate, she learned, she thought, “Ah-ha.” She had
an opportunity then to have someone help layout her dream. And so Don, when he
could, worked a little bit with her and laid out a scheme that she liked. And
that’s what became the Richmond Art Center.

SELVIDGE: Wow. And was that something that they did during the war, or they
didn’t start actually building till afterwards?

HARDISON: It became part of the bond issue where they were building a new city
hall. And so it’s part of the city hall complex. If you’re not familiar with
it, it is on Barrett Avenue and about 25th Street. But it operated in this
storefront upstairs for all of the years of inception, while city hall was being
built and all of that. So I think that complex became complete about 1956 or
thereabouts. So it was a good ten years, ten years in becoming what it is today.
But it was fun to be in on the ground floor. So I did that until Steve came along.

SELVIDGE: That’s your son, I guess.

HARDISON: Yeah.

SELVIDGE: I’d like to hear about the changes when your son was born. But I’m
also curious, even before then, did you find it challenging to have a full-time
job and also do the laundry and the shopping and all the things around the house?

HARDISON: Oh, it wasn’t a challenge; it was just -- it was there. It had to be
done. No, it was part of life. And I can’t think of any other little things
that might be of interest, unless you ask.

SELVIDGE: Well, I’d like to hear about, since you were one of the first
couples to move into Atchison Village, it seems like there’s sort of a long
way from that to this experience you’re talking about of people sleeping in
movie theaters and all this sort of craziness. Or was that -- ?

HARDISON: Oh, that was almost immediate. Yeah. Yeah, people were being recruited
during all that period. And until housing became available -- which it didn’t
for another year or so; it was more like 1943 before other units began to be
built -- that people had to find homes or had to commute quite a ways to other
communities. The ferry brought a lot of people. Trains, they had trains that
brought people from other areas.

SELVIDGE: I’m curious what it was like. You said you’ve met a lot of people
through church, and also you’ve been talking about your neighbors. And we were
talking as well about you and your husband both being natives of California. So
I’m wondering, was it different to meet people from different places? Or what
was that like?

HARDISON: Oh, absolutely. And some of these couples that we met through the
church were from other parts of the country. I remember one couple from South
Carolina that we became very close with. And he worked in the powder plant. That
was out at a community near us. It was called Giant. I don’t know giant what,
but Giant was the name of the community. But it was a powder facility. And he
worked in that. The other neighbor at the other end of our building worked for
Standard Oil. A lot of people worked for Standard Oil that were in that complex.
And the fireman next door. Let’s see, there was another couple that worked for
the city -- some kind of job, I don’t recall.

SELVIDGE: Did it seem, though, like people were sort of different from the type
of people that you had grown up with, or just -- ?

HARDISON: No, not at all. No. They were all professional people. And they all
had the same college background and interests.

SELVIDGE: So it was sort of easy to get along.

HARDISON: It was. Yeah.

SELVIDGE: Were there things that were surprising to them about California or
Richmond, that you remember?

HARDISON: I think a lot of them liked it so much they ended up staying. And we
decided to stay in the community. Because we had no idea what we’d be doing
after the war. Don, with an architectural degree, had worked for several
architects individually, just after school. But then he suddenly stopped naval
architecture to turn to architecture -- actually, so there were some people that
worked in his department that ended up starting their own design practice with
Don. So many people ended up staying in our community that we thought there was
a lot of potential for us. And so that’s where Don opened his practice,
shortly after the war. Then he got his license. You have to have an
architectural license to practice; but you have to have a certain amount of
experience first, which he managed to acquire, working with other architects.

SELVIDGE: Yeah. So since we’re in the right chronology, why don’t we then go
to what you were going to tell me about when your son was born?

HARDISON: Oh, okay.

SELVIDGE: Which is right around the same time, in 1945, right?

HARDISON: Right. And let’s see. When was Hiroshima?

SELVIDGE: Oh, what month?

HARDISON: The bomb. The Japanese. I remember being pregnant, and that was such a
turn of events, but also such a scary thing. We still didn’t know what was
going to happen, whether that would be the end of the war or whether it was just
creating more. And so it was an uneasy time. And we weren’t ready to move yet.

SELVIDGE: Yeah. What was it like to be pregnant at that time and expecting a
child in such a scary time?

HARDISON: Yeah, it was right at the end of the war. And we had had some
miscarriages before that, so we could’ve had more children by then. Which
everybody was doing. That was life; start your family when you’re first
married. So it was an uneasy time, but it worked. I was always confident in Don.
He seemed to know the right things to do. He was a leader. And I think that made
it a lot easier for me.

SELVIDGE: Yeah. So your son was born in 1945.

HARDISON: Yeah. And then when Don started his practice, then I worked for him.

SELVIDGE: And did you stop your job once you were expecting?

HARDISON: Oh, I did. Once the war was over.

SELVIDGE: Once the war was over.

HARDISON: Right. Right.

SELVIDGE: Which coincided with --

HARDISON: Coincided with Steve’s birth. And I guess I would’ve had to quit,
if the war hadn’t stopped then. But that all worked out very well. And then I
went to work for Don. I helped establish his office, the office part. And that
was interesting.

SELVIDGE: And so you decided to stay in Richmond. You thought, “We like this
community; we’re happy.”

HARDISON: Very much. Yeah, very much.

SELVIDGE: And you stayed in the one-bedroom in Atchison.

HARDISON: We did, until about 1948 -- well, at that time houses, places were not
available. But we found an unfinished house on 34th St. Apparently, a couple had
started to build it and their marriage didn’t last. So we picked up on it and
finished it, and lived there for, oh, maybe six or eight years. And started
dreaming of this, our current home. So in the meantime, Don had a couple of
different locations for his office in Richmond. And he started out with two
partners that had worked for him at the shipyard, as well. And most all of those
were either architects or landscape architects. They were all in the field. So
that was kind of a natural for him, to tie in with somebody that he liked that
he could work with. So the first partnership had three, Don and two partners.
And we had a little storefront for an office. It was a little grocery store with
a little winery in the back, I think but we cleaned that up, cleaned that office
up and made it work.

SELVIDGE: And so you worked in the office.

HARDISON: In 1949 we were blessed with a dear baby girl, Janet. We were so
fortunate to have a boy and a girl. Yes. And I had a babysitter. Those days, it
was easy to get a babysitter, people that you could really trust. And so I
worked at the offices, along with volunteering. We both felt a commitment to the
community. We felt that we owed the community something. And so we became
volunteers in many different areas. I went as a volunteer for the YWCA. And I
ended up being on the board. And then I was in other nonprofits that raised
money to help different causes in the community. So I ended up being president
of most all those that I worked in. And all the time, I was also working at the
Art Center as well. And so I ended up being secretary of the Richmond Art Center
board. And early on, right after the move into the Civic Center complex. And
I’ve remained on that board. I’ve served on the board now, I can’t
remember whether it’s three or four times. You can serve on the board a
three-year term and then a six-year term, and you have to get off after six
years. So I’ve gotten on and off several times. And I’ve been president of
the board a couple of times. And it’s been a life that we both have enjoyed
and felt a commitment to. Both of us have enjoyed the art background. And Don
has even served on the board, but a different time. And both of our children
grew up at the Art Center.

SELVIDGE: Oh, that’s great.

HARDISON: And then our grandchildren.

SELVIDGE: Can you tell me a little bit about things changed after the war ended,
just around town in Richmond and what happened?

HARDISON: Well, yeah. There were musical groups. They were usually membership
kind of things; you’d pay a membership and then there would be concerts that
we could attend, series. We enjoyed doing that. And there were dance groups.
Those were fun. We met a lot more people from the community that way. What else
did we do? We were not golfers, even though we live on a golf course. We tried,
but we seem to be more work oriented or volunteer oriented than golf-interested.
We both enjoy theater, going to theater productions. And we enjoy going to San
Francisco for those kinds of things, as well as locally. We enjoy the symphony.
The symphony partly because, I guess, we were both instrumentalists back in our
youth, and we just happen to like that kind of music.

SELVIDGE: I’m curious, just going back a little bit to the time, I guess sort
of late forties, early fifties, and the time that you were still in Atchison and
then in the house in Richmond, before you moved here to El Cerrito. You
mentioned that a lot of your neighbors liked California and didn’t want to go
back to where they came from. But I’m just sort of curious about how many
people stayed in Richmond, or if people kind of left as quickly as they had come
in, or what that was like.

HARDISON: Among our friends?

SELVIDGE: Sure. Among your friends or within the town, either way.

HARDISON: Well, our friends mostly stayed. Or were originally from here, and
maybe we were the newcomer.

SELVIDGE: Right. So there was a good bit of stability for you, socially.

HARDISON: Very much so. Very much so. Like in our church group, was our dentist
and our doctor and our --

SELVIDGE: And all those stayed the same?

HARDISON: Yes. Yes. And as far as the general public, a lot of them stayed. The
community grew from 27,000 to -- it became 125,000. And I think that’s what it
still is, about that.

SELVIDGE: But of course the jobs didn’t all stay.

HARDISON: No. And that’s really interesting because the job that I had, where
I had to find housing for so many people, I really absorbed the names of these
people. And it’s interesting then how, through the years, in the newspaper or
wherever, I might be -- I’d hear some of these same names --

SELVIDGE: Oh, wow. And you would recognize them.

HARDISON:  -- that I ended up having had some connection with somewhere along
the line. It’s kind of funny. But people, I think, really liked the community.
The community was very accepting. There are differences of opinion there. I’ve
heard that some are countering that kind of a notion. But I think generally,
people were very accepting. They had to be. They had to learn to work together,
live together and play together.

SELVIDGE: Is there anything that sort of sticks out in your mind, examples of
that kind of openness in the community?

HARDISON: Well, yeah, all the activities that worked around -- like the church.
The church was really dominant. Also the other churches, not just ours. All of
them were an activity or were a second home for a lot of people. And it was a
comfort zone. And local people belonged to those churches and it made us feel
welcome. There are a lot of areas where people feel that diversity was not
welcome. But the shipyards, in our opinion, did not become very diverse until
around 1943 and ’44, when they began bringing people from the Deep South in.
And then I think there were areas of unrest. Some people felt that civil rights
were being abused at that point. But somehow people bring those things with
them, in some ways. So we didn’t experience that.

SELVIDGE: Throughout that time, then, you did continue in the same job, right?
And like you said, it’s around the same time that you’re saying, ’43, that
housing started becoming more available, as well.

HARDISON: Right, the housing projects. There were different projects, three or
four throughout the town, and maybe -- I can’t remember the numbers, but maybe
a hundred here, a hundred there or whatever. So that began to take off the load.

SELVIDGE: So things sort of eased up a little bit after that point?

HARDISON: Right. Right.

SELVIDGE: Like you said, there was sort of an influx of people, a new influx of people.

HARDISON: Well, the influx was when we came ourselves.

SELVIDGE: You came in the first big wave, right. And then there was another sort
of later moment.

HARDISON: Right. Yeah. And then, of course, we had a local link that made us
feel comfortable. Our best man’s father was local and helped us get into the
community. So that I think we had a more privileged introduction, which may not
be fair in some people’s eyes. But that’s just the way the world works.

SELVIDGE: That just makes me think, did you find that as your friends and
neighbors who might not have been from the area were having children, that it
really made a difference for them, not having family around? Did they have
different relationships with their neighbors because of that?

HARDISON: Oh, I think we all became their family. In fact, Vallejo, you’d
think, would be close enough so that we would have our family in Vallejo; but it
wasn’t that easy for us to go home all that often, to them. And Don’s family
in Southern California, we saw them rarely. And so we were sort of all in the
same work situation.

SELVIDGE: So you all sort of had that feeling of helping each other out, in the
ways that families would.

HARDISON: Absolutely. Right. Well, took care of each other’s kids. I took care
of neighbors’ kids before I had any. And then when I had mine, they helped us.
And that’s a happy growth situation.

SELVIDGE: I guess maybe we can jump forward a little bit. You’ve talked some
about the new -- after the war, Don’s practice, the new --

HARDISON: The new community.

SELVIDGE: The new community.

HARDISON: Yeah. Don was responsible then for -- or I guess fortunate enough to
be assigned a lot of commissions to build new housing for purchase, for people
to buy. And so we were fortunate that those kind of commissions came his way.
And schools had to be built -- he designed several schools -- and community
centers, all of those kind of things that help strengthen a community. And so
that was heavy involvement.

SELVIDGE: I wonder if you could tell me a little, as well, about people you knew
looking for new places to settle and new houses. As you said, you started
thinking about this location and I’m sure a lot of other people also must’ve
moved from places like Atchison to houses, perhaps --

HARDISON: Exactly.

SELVIDGE:  -- in the suburbs and things like that.

HARDISON: Yeah, it was. In the suburbs, either to find a house that was already
built, which some did; our neighbors did that. And we started looking at
property. We were certain we were going to stay in this area, so we started
looking at different properties. And it was a while before we found this. And
then it took us a while to build it. But others -- a lot of the shipyard workers
that were working class, the workers -- the ship fitters, the pipe fitters, the
welders -- were the people that needed the housing. And those were the kind of
houses that Don designed. A developer did it, but Don worked for the developer.
And they were small houses that they could afford. And so that has been really
the core of Richmond, where the craftsmen have been provided housing, and stayed.

SELVIDGE: So a lot of your friends and neighbors sort of stayed in the general vicinity.

HARDISON: Yes.

SELVIDGE: Did any of them move around here, as well?

HARDISON: Yes, our dentist moved down below us, and our doctor is a ways down.
We were very close friends. Our children grew up together.

SELVIDGE: So you were able to maintain a lot of the friendships.

HARDISON: Yes, very definitely. And those were all people we met at church.
First off. That’s where we went in the beginning, and that’s where -- a lot
of those people had just come, as well; some were here already. Some were native
of Richmond and helped orient us and helped make us welcome. So we became part
of their community. It wasn’t hard. [chuckles] It was really easy to do.

SELVIDGE: It sounds like you had a really good community life.

HARDISON: Yeah, we had such a very nice relationship. And as I said, we felt we
needed to give to the community, as well. And so in addition to my volunteering,
Don headed up several different things for the community. One was a Festival of
the Arts. And the Chamber of Commerce. And we just became involved.

SELVIDGE: This might seem like a sort of silly detail, but I realized that you
mentioned this, and I never heard the other side of the story. I always like to
hear when people learn to drive. You mentioned that you didn’t know how to
drive and you would walk to the Greek store.

HARDISON: Yeah, and how come I didn’t drive? And what happened?

SELVIDGE: I’d like to know -- I’m assuming you later then did learn to drive.

HARDISON: Oh, yes, I did.

SELVIDGE: It’s just fun to hear the stories.

HARDISON: Well, after my kids were born and I got over my little snit, Don tried
to teach me to drive on our honeymoon and --

SELVIDGE: It didn’t work out?

HARDISON:  -- that’s not a time to learn to drive. On the road from Tahoe to
Reno. That’s not the place to learn.

SELVIDGE: It’s a pretty curvy road, too, yeah.

HARDISON: That’s not the place to learn to drive. And so no, I just didn’t
after that.

SELVIDGE: So you put it off for a while, but once you had the kids, then it
seemed more --

HARDISON: Once I had the kids, and -- yeah. I had to.

SELVIDGE: So that changed the way that you wanted to be able to have -- ?

HARDISON: Oh, it changed the way we lived. Yeah, I didn’t have to walk to the
grocery store anymore. [laughs] No, we lived in our next house when I learned to
drive. And of course, when you do that, then you need the car. And that
introduces new problems. You need both cars. That’s life.

SELVIDGE: I guess it was easier to get something like a car, once the war was
over, as well.

HARDISON: Oh, sure. And we were working and able to afford it.

SELVIDGE: I don’t know if there’s more, other topics you want to touch on.

HARDISON: No, I’ve already touched on the Art Center being a major part of our
life. That requires a lot of volunteerism. Have you been there?

SELVIDGE: I haven’t been, no. I’ve been to the City Hall area.

HARDISON: Okay. Well, it’s right next door.

SELVIDGE: I’ve seen it next door, but I haven’t been.

HARDISON: Well, there’s a nice exhibition right now. And I enjoyed working at
the Art Center because I took various classes. I didn’t just take ceramics; I
took basket weaving and everything except painting. I don’t think I’m a
painter; I’ve never tried. Maybe I could be Grandma Moses at this point or
something, but -- the crafts interest me. And weaving, tapestries and fabrics,
screen printing -- I’ve done all of those, and it’s fascinating. And it fits
in with Don’s architecture, too, as well. But I’ve done everything at the
Art Center, from helping the curator install an exhibition and --

SELVIDGE: That’s great.

HARDISON: We had a rental gallery for a long time, and I was involved with
artists. So I’ve just enjoyed that aspect of making it work. It’s a city
building and we receive city sponsorship, to a point. So we’re fortunate to be
able to keep it going.

SELVIDGE: And the Center offers classes to people in the community.

HARDISON: But mostly, we provide art in the schools. We provide art in the
communities, in the neighborhoods, for underprivileged kids. And we bring them
into the Art Center. And so it’s not just adult classes. We do have
children’s classes and work hard to try and have scholarships so that we can
provide that kind of incentive, because so many young people don’t experience
that. So that’s been a goal of ours, is to try and make things work there that
help provide that.

SELVIDGE: And it’s become such a vital institution, over so many years.

HARDISON: It’s really -- seventy-five years, we’re going to celebrate this
year. So it’s been fun to be part of that and hang in there.

SELVIDGE: You have to hang in there these days, with anything like that. It’s
always threatened by --

HARDISON: It is threatened.

SELVIDGE:  -- lack of priorities.

HARDISON: Membership is an important element. And that’s something that’s
hard to do and hard to keep going. And yet it’s the core, it’s the backbone
of an organization that makes something work. So that’s the area that I’ve
tried to focus on. It’s getting harder. I can’t do this forever. But it’s
nice to have an interest like that.

SELVIDGE: And to contribute something so important.

HARDISON: Yeah. Most of the other nonprofits that I did so much volunteer work
for have more or less gone by the wayside. People went back to work. I didn’t
work full-time, but from time to time, I worked. Always at Don’s office; I
didn’t work anywhere else. Except as a volunteer, I worked other places. I
worked as a volunteer at Rosie the Riveter Memorial Park. But basically, I would
work at Don’s office. And he’s had three or four moves and locations, and
that’s made it interesting.

SELVIDGE: No more rules against husbands and wives working together.

HARDISON: No, right. We did our own thing. That was kind of funny. And I suppose
maybe it might still be the case in some situations. So that was okay. I just
moved from one kind of situation to another. And it worked.

SELVIDGE: Great.

HARDISON: So you were basically interested in the war years.

SELVIDGE: Yeah. That’s sort of the focus of the project, is the changes and
the --

HARDISON: Well, it’s interesting how many people are contacting us, or Don,
especially, now. We’ve become the historians. [laughs]

SELVIDGE: Well, it’s really important.

HARDISON: And it’s interesting to dip back and remember.

SELVIDGE: Absolutely. It’s interesting for me, too. I really enjoy it.

HARDISON: Well, I hope so.

SELVIDGE: Great. Okay, well, I think we’ll stop there.

HARDISON: Okay, unless you have any more questions. And I can’t think of any.

SELVIDGE: I can’t think of any right now, so that should do it.
