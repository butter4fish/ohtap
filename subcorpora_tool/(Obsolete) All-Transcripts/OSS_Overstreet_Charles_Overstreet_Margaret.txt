 Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  My name is Karen Neurohr. I   m the principal investigator for the O-STATE  Stories Oral History Project for the OSU Library. These  interviews are taking place in Poteau, Oklahoma at the home of F. L.  and Genevieve Holton. Today is October 5, 2006. Steve Holton is going  to be asking the questions. Our first interviews are with Charles A.  Overstreet, Jr.   he is from the Class of 1942   and Charles    wife,  Margaret Ann Talbot Overstreet, and she attended Oklahoma A M  College from 1944 to 1946.  As you all know, Oklahoma State has one of the largest Homecoming  celebrations in the United States. I think they still have the biggest  parade. I don   t think anyone does house decorations like they do at OSU  now. And what we would like to have you share with us is memories of  Homecoming when you were at Oklahoma A M. So, C. A., what are  some recollections you have?  Well, I remember when the fraternities and sororities would decorate  and we   d work for a long time getting the decorations up. I don   t  remember a lot about it. You may have waited a year or two too late to  interview me. My memory is not as good as it used to be, but I  remember one Homecoming they interviewed the fathers and sons, and  the sons were one-inch taller than their daddies. (Laughter) This  meaning the generations were getting bigger. But other than that, I don   t  remember a lot about Homecoming. It wasn   t as big an event then as it is  now, of course.  Did they do floats?  Oh, yes. Yes.  Chicken wire with crepe paper stuffed in it?  5  C. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  C. Overstreet  Yes. It wasn   t very extensive.  Margaret Ann, do you have any recollection of Homecoming?  I have no recollection whatsoever of Homecoming. The two years I was  in school we did go to the Cotton Bowl. We went to the Sugar Bowl. We  did have parades, and we had floats and so forth   and a day off from  class. And those were the big events. We also won the basketball NCAA  championship two years in a row. So I was there back in the glory days.  (Laughter) It was during the war. People didn   t have gasoline. Most of  our football games were at Taft   s Junior High stadium in Oklahoma  City.  Any other thoughts about Homecoming?  No. I say, I don   t remember the Homecoming. I don   t even know that  they had it because people couldn   t come. My parents were never able to  come to see me in school.  Did they have Parents    Weekend back then?  They had Mother   s Day at the fraternity house, I remember.  And the sororities probably had, I   ll bet, a Dad   s Day.  No. I mean, we didn   t. Dads couldn   t get there. There was one old hotel  in town, downtown, that was open. No motel.  Are there any other traditions you all remember, of course, as far as  rivalries? I think I can guess who the main rival was at that time     (Laughter)  OU  University of Oklahoma . (Laughter)  Can you remember any of those games? C. A.? OU and OSU games?  No. Not too well, except that they   d have to get them off campus  sometimes. There would be fights afterwards. (Laughter) I don   t  remember many of the games.  You talked about the bowl games you remember     I   m like C. A. there. The police had to come several times and escort the  teams out of town    (Laughter)     and people would drink a lot at those games.  6  M. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  C. Overstreet  Holton  A very good amount. No, seriously.  Would the students go over to Norman when the game was played at  Norman?  I didn   t. I don   t think people traveled that much. I think gas probably  was fifteen cents a gallon, but we didn   t run around much. There weren   t  any cars on campus at all in my day.  So, from a money standpoint and transportation, it just wasn   t   common      Well, that was just after the Depression and they just didn   t do that much  in sports. Sports is a lot bigger now than it was back then.  What about hangouts or gathering places when you were on campus?  Well, back in those days you could have a date for a dime. You could go  to   sorority houses would be open and the girls dorm   and they   d have  music and dances for thirty minutes after dinner, and you could walk  down to the Oasis on the corner and, I believe, Cokes were just a nickel.  And for a dime you could have a date    (Laughter) every night  (Laughter) which I thought was nice because I visited several sororities  and several dorms and made friends at several, and it was open house  every night during the week.  Yes. During just the few years    difference that you all were there, did the  hangouts change or was the Oasis still     No. The athletes pretty well hung out around Swim   s. The Aggie Drug  was pretty general. It was up at the corner, and we   d go over there for  Cokes during   after dance hour. We had from 7:00 to 8:00 dance hour,  and you   d dance for thirty minutes and walk to the corner and have a  nickel Coke and come back. Taxi-cabs were a dime. The Y Hut. It was  in the middle of the campus and journalism students pretty much hung  out there. The Frat Shop was across the street from the Chi Omega  house, and the sorority girls kind of hung out there. The Rock was a  crummy little old dance place clear out on the other side of town that we  went to on Saturday nights. It   d just be packed.  We   d have dances at the Armory, the old Armory   and above the Oasis  was a dance floor, and fraternities and sororities would have dances  there.  If you wanted to see a movie, would you walk downtown? Was that     7  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  Oh, sometimes you   d take a cab and fill it up five at a time. (Laughter)  It   d be cheaper that way. I remember holding girls on my lap all the way  to town. (Laughter)  What about Theta Pond? Was it there?  It was there, and I got thrown in one time. It was just across the street.  We were next door to Pi Phi house, and it was right in front of the Pi Phi  house, so they didn   t have to carry me very far to throw me in. I don   t  know what I did, but it wasn   t wrong, I don   t think. (Laughs)  And dancing was a big activity?  Oh, yes. Yes, it was.  Oh. Let   s see here     I wasn   t allowed to go to Theta Pond. We couldn   t go.  I didn   t say I went. (Laughter)  Okay, what brought each of you to Stillwater? Why was that your choice  of schools?  Well, I was interested in agriculture, and we had land and I was born on  a ranch, and I just always had that in mind to end up on the ranch and, of  course, Oklahoma State is an agriculture college and I majored in  Agronomy   I mean in Animal Science Agriculture, so there wasn   t any  choice or any contest with other schools. And we were invited over     two seniors out of my class   like two would go to OU, and Oklahoma  State would invite two, and I was one of the two that went over to see  the college while I was still in high school. They   d pick out two seniors  every year.  How old were you when you were a freshman?  When I was a freshman in college? I imagine I was eighteen.  Do you remember being homesick?  Well, like I say, we didn   t have cars and we wouldn   t run and go home  every holiday. I remember one Thanksgiving it was awful quiet and I  was in the house by myself, and I did get homesick, but     What took you to OSU?  8  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  Oh, Steve. I really don   t know. I   d just heard of it, I guess, and knew  several other of my people that had graduated from Broken Arrow that  had gone to OSU, and I just wanted to go. (Laughs)  Do you remember going that first day whenever your, I guess, family  probably moved you over?  No, I rode with a friend and their parents. Like I say, you know, people  didn   t have tires or gasoline when I was in college, and so they offered  to take me. And I shipped my trunk later with my clothes in it.  Do you remember being homesick that first year?  Not particularly.  Not particularly?  My best friend got homesick and went home. (Laughs) She got that  homesick.  World War II kind of hit in between you all as far as school goes     Well, it was pretty   my first year was pretty much still        still full war?  Yes.  I   m sure that affected a lot of people   s decisions whether to go to school  or not go to school. Of course     Well, it affected        many were in the military     We had lots of military right there on campus. We had the WAVES   Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service  in two of the  dorms, girls    dorms. They had the Japanese language school there   had  some seventeen-year-old program reserve, officer training program, but  the WAVES would yell out the window and call us draft dodgers.  (Laughter) They were there for a business course and they completely  took over the Morrill Hall. We didn   t have any   my classes were  upstairs over the drugstore down at the corner.  What about your student life? You lived in the fraternity house?  9  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  Yes.  And can you tell us a little bit about life there and how many boys were  in the house and that type of thing?  Well, I   ve forgotten how many were in the pledge class, but they  encouraged us to be in outside activities. I was President of the Ittanaha  Club, which was an Indian club, and I wrestled and they   d have, inter-fraternity  athletics, and I whipped the ex-state champion because I was  in shape and he wasn   t. (Laughter) But I   d get out every other morning  and run about three miles when   and I took coaching   wrestling under  the great coach  Coach Art Griffith  while I was there. He was   he had  the palsy, but he was there. And so that was a plus to get to take  wrestling under him. But we   they   d move us around   wouldn   t let us  live a year with the same   we   d have a pledge and a member in a room  together and then they   d change us around   make us get acquainted  with each other and we sure enjoyed the fraternity life. Some of my  fraternity brothers went on, one of them to be General  Sales  Manager  of Halliburton Oil and one of them was Vice President of Standard Oil  and some smart boys in my class.  We need you to say which fraternity that was.  Sigma Nu. And we were a good fraternity, I think. And I worked. I was  a yard man for the fraternity, and I worked at a hamburger stand.  Everybody had extra jobs, and it kept us out of trouble.  As far as communicating with, say, the girls over in the sorority houses  or the dorms   now I   m guessing that you didn   t have a phone in every  room in the fraternity house so     No. No, they   d be down the hall, and when they found out   when we  were going to have a dance, well I   d rush to the phone and get a date  before somebody else got it. I usually ended up with a pretty cute date  by managing phone calls. But some old boy would have a date and come  in and get on the phone and monopolize it for an hour, and I never could  understand how somebody could talk that long, but (Laughs) those  fraternity brothers did. (Laughs)  Where did you live, Margaret Ann?  In the Pi Phi house, next door to the Sigma Nu house. And you lived in  the same house when you were in school.  Still has the pink tile in the bathroom.  10  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  Oh, really? (Laughter)  Do you remember how many girls approximately were in the sorority?  About fifty. Close to it.  It was the largest     Yes, yes.  And a great location.  Very great. Super great.  Did you walk to class?  Oh, yes.  Did you all have much to do with the Sigma Nu   s being next door?  No, fraternities  were  open the first year I was in school. And no  fraternity boys came back   probably second semester of my second  year and they got the fraternities open. Girls had lived in the fraternity  houses the year before I came to school because military had all the  dorms, and boys, independent boys, lived in the fraternity houses. Then  the second year, even though the fraternities opened, they didn   t have  their houses. I think maybe the next year possibly they did, but they  didn   t those two years.  Tell us about dating. Did you do things as groups, boys and girls, or was  it more just couples going off on their own?  Pretty much couples. Well, I said you just had an hour during the week.  You had to get in at 8:00 until you were a junior, and it was 10:00 or  11:00, I think, on the weekends. And on the weekends, we   d go out, like  I say, to that place, The Rock, and dance. That was kind of the big deal,  and dance hour during the week. That   s about   maybe a movie on the  weekends, but the movie   there was a theater there up at the corner  that   s, you know   I don   t know how to explain what the corner is now  because        across from the fire station     Yes. That   s all it was known as when we were in school   the corner.  How much was the movie, C. A., when you were there? What was the  11  C. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  cost, do you remember?  I can remember when I was in high school what it was   fifteen cents,  and I think you could go to three movies   there were three movies in  Muskogee at the time. You could, I believe for thirty-five cents, you  could go to all three of them. (Laughter) But I don   t remember how  much it was in college.  Do you have a favorite story, Margaret Ann, from your days in  Stillwater?  They were all favorites. I loved it. I had a wonderful two years. Every  fall, I want to go back to college.  What about you, C. A.? Any stories?  I don   t have any bitter memories at all. I enjoyed it. Everybody was  serious about   of course, the war was coming on and we were serious  about that and we were serious about money   and there weren   t any bad  attitudes. Everybody had a good attitude. They were up there to learn,  and some of them did real well.  Do you all recall any thoughts about when they were going to change  the name from Oklahoma A M to Oklahoma State University?  Well, I remember when I think there were nine colleges there, and I  remember talking about the change from A M. Yeah, I remember it,  but I wasn   t involved in it in any way.  You weren   t     They didn   t let us vote     I had no objection to it.  Yes. To go to Oklahoma State University?  Yes.  Let me see. Any advice for students today?  Well, I think they ought to learn English in high school because back in  those days, why everybody nearly had to go to remedial English. They  just didn   t learn it in high schools like they should. I went one year to  junior college, and she taught us English. And so I guess I did all right. I  didn   t take remedial English anyway. I remember some of those old  12  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  country boys would take Home Economics 101 to learn manners,  (Laughs) how to set a table and so forth. I remember taking that. I  elected   going four years and a half, I had some extra time, and I guess  F. L. and I were some of the first students that learned to fly while we  were up there. I ended up in the Air Force. But it was sure great knowing  that you had friends in nearly every town in Oklahoma that you   d get  acquainted with in college, and after I went overseas and during the war,  well, you were just as apt to see somebody you knew in London as if  you were walking down the streets of Oklahoma City, and I saw several  over there.  When you learned to fly, was that through the university or was it  through an ROTC program or     No, that was a college course.  College course.  But everybody back then, it was compulsory freshman and sophomore to  take military, and I happened to like military, and so I went and asked     I wanted to take advanced military   for some reason, very many people  didn   t, but I asked them, I said,    If I   ll go an extra semester to school,  will you let me double up one year, one semester, so I could graduate?     and, of course, that just tickled the brass to death to see somebody was  eager. So they were good to me. They gave me a battalion and gave me  an A at summer camp, and I enjoyed the military.  Where was the summer camp?  Camp Bullis at San Antonio.  And is this your last year in school   the summer between?  Well, yes. The last between junior and senior year, yes   and that would  be 1941.  When you were in school, Margaret Ann, did C. A.   s reputation   was it  still people talking about him after he was     I   d never heard of him. (Laughter)  Well, I just figured he was a ladies    man and I thought they might still  be     No. No.  13  C. Overstreet  M. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  Holton  M. Overstreet  C. Overstreet  M. Overstreet  C. Overstreet  Holton  C. Overstreet  M. Overstreet  No, I don   t think so.  I knew a lot of boys that came back that he had known in school, and my  roommate married a good friend of his and   I say we both   or I knew  quite a few people that he was in school with, but I   d never heard of  him. (Laughter) I didn   t meet him for two years after that.  Oh. When you all were on campus, I know the Student Union that   s there  today wasn   t there. What about the library? The library that we have  today was     Well, there was a little library, but it wasn   t much.  Where was it located?  Well, ask F. L.  F.L. Holton is a friend of C.A. Overstreet  (Laughter)  He spent more time there than I did.  I guess there was nothing the equivalent of a Student Union?  No. No. No.  Other than the Y Hut or     Y Hut. Yes.  Yes.  Just the Y Hut.  But I never went there.  Can you all think of anything else? Just kind of a closing thought about  your time in college     Well, it just amazes me what it was like then and the differences now     or even living or being young   how serious we were and we didn   t buy  a pop every day or ice cream cone every day. People took care of their  nickels and I loaned my fraternity brothers a quarter, fifty cents and a  dollar at a time. Everybody was   they   they   d pay me back, but if they  had a date, wouldn   t have any money a lot of them, so they   d come  borrow a quarter or fifty cents from me. But I never did get any interest  out of it. (Laughter) But it was good fellowship.  But it had changed a lot after, when our three kids went. And changed a  lot between the time Ann was in school and Jim, which was twelve or  14  Holton  C. Overstreet  M. Overstreet  thirteen years.  Yes. Those were times of change right through there   mid    60s. Thank  you all very much.  Thank you.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
