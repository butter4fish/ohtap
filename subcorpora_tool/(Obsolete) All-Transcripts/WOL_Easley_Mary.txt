Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Today is November 10, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library and I   m conducting an oral history  project called    Women of the Oklahoma Legislature.    Today I   m with  Senator Mary Easley. She was elected to the House in 1996 and then  elected to the Senate in 2004 and will term out in 2010.  That   s right.  Thank you for having me today. We   ll get started by having you tell us a  little bit about your childhood, where you were born.  It   s always fun to talk about my childhood. I had a sort of Norman  Rockwell experience, I believe, because I grew up in a small rural  southeast community in Missouri with many aunts, uncles, and a host of  cousins. We spent a lot of time together. Living on the farm, playing in  the streams with my cousins and my neighbors and friends, and just  enjoying life.  What did your parents do for a living?  My parents were farmers so I had a lot of pets. In fact, my father named  each cow in his dairy herd. I remember some of their names even today.  There was Prince, Princess, Queenie. I enjoy thinking about the past and  what it was like for me as a child.  How did you come to be in Oklahoma?  As a result of my husband changing positions and jobs, we moved to  Tulsa. When we first married, we lived in Wichita, Kansas, where he  was employed with Boeing Aircraft. That is where I finished my  education, at Friends University, just following him around. We  eventually came to Oklahoma where he is currently employed with  5  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  American Airlines.  And what is your educational background?  My parents always planned for me to go to college. I attended Southwest  Baptist College. When I married and moved to Wichita I attended  friends University where I finished an undergraduate degree and started  a master   s program. I worked on my master   s for approximately a year  while teaching and attending school nights and summers.  Then I  went  to Wichita State. My first teaching position was in Valley Center,  Kansas. It was a wonderful experience. I loved the community. Many  families had some of the same values that I did growing up and were  very welcoming. When I left there, I cried. I thought Oklahoma was not  the land of opportunity. (Laughs) But when I got here and met the  people and became involved in a school in Owasso, Oklahoma, where I  taught twenty-four more years, I found that I really am an Okie.  When did you move to Oklahoma?  We moved in 1967.  And you taught English?  I taught English at Owasso High School.  How did you transition from being an English teacher to a politician?   Toward the end of my  teaching career, my son Kevin was a senator. I  became very impressed with the legislative process  and had a lot of  advice for him . He finally just gave up and decided that I would never  understand the process.  I did not understand at the time that it takes  much longer to get things done. I was very interested in improving  education and providing a better educational experience for our  children.   Tell us about the moment you decided to run.  I remember the exact moment. We were, as a family, at Grand Lake  celebrating a holiday. The topic of politics came up and we were  discussing our district. I was preparing a meal and  listening to the  discussion . I thought to myself, I will run for that seat and try to get  some legislation passed that I   m very concerned about.  When I found  an opportunity  to inject some conversation, I said to my son and the rest  of the family,    I   m going to retire from teaching and run for District 78.     There was dead silence. I wasn   t really ready to retire. I loved teaching  and I loved my students and the community, the principal, our  6  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  administration, and staff. I didn   t have a single complaint.  After a few moments, Kevin looked at me and said,    If you   re going to  do that, you will work hard and you will win.    That   s where I started. I  didn   t know how  difficult it would be , but always thought I would win.  I think there was some doubt in the minds of my husband and my  children whether I   d be able to win  in a Republican district with a  Republican incumbent . I believe when you have a passion for  something and you   re willing and want to work hard, it can be done.  Talk a little bit about your campaign, the first one.  The first campaign was a real challenge. I thought, I  would  retire  from  teaching  and work maybe a couple hours or so a week, campaigning,  and still win. It was far from what I had anticipated. Kevin decided we  needed a campaign manager and that it would be Bill Wiseman, his  campaign manager. He was excellent. He understood our family, he  understood our values, and when I met him, I was very impressed. He  was a great motivator. Together, we developed a plan and that plan  would be that I would walk  door-to-door , not one or two hours a week,  but every day  And I would walk that district two or three times so that  people would know me and know my issues and I would know them.  Actually, the people in House District 78 were people just like us. They  had some of the same values that I had and some of the same dreams and  hopes for our children: good education, good healthcare. The ability and  opportunity to make a good living for their families and some moral  issues  were other things  we had in common. It was very easy to  represent that district. I still have a great love for those people today.  If I were home having a cup of coffee in the morning and it was nine  o   clock, I would get a call. It would be Kevin. He would say,    What are  you doing home? You   re supposed to work from nine o   clock until dark  every day.    That   s a long day, but I   m quite used to working long days  being a teacher. I would say to him,    I   m a retired teacher. I need some  time.    However, I would get up and go. I always found it very rewarding  to meet with people. I would invariably spend my day, or some  afternoon, in someone   s home discussing political issues and having a  cup of coffee with them. Those people got to know me and I got to know  them. It was a great experience.  Did you have a slogan?  Oh yes. I helped Kevin get his slogan so I took the same one he had:     Easley the Best Choice.    I feel like that   s a good slogan because it   s  grammatically correct.  7  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  And I understand you had a special vehicle?  Yes. The second term I ran, I decided I needed a point of interest or   something  catchy besides the slogan and the signs I had. I wanted  something that would attract attention. I was running against the same  gentleman that I ran against the first time. My colors were red and white,  so I decided it would be interesting to have a red Volkswagen and call it     Mary   s Votes Wagon.    My husband put together a sign to place on top  of the car that spelled out    Mary   s Votes Wagon.     That little red car  caught the attention of  the local news media who came and  did an  interview  as I was walking door-to-door. It gave us a lot of free  publicity.  So you beat the incumbent?  Again. The first time I think we won 51  to 49 . The second time it  was greater. In fact, it was considered a landslide the second time.  Talk a little bit about your swearing-in day, the first one.  When I first came to the Capitol, of course I was very excited. I had won  and had challenged an incumbent, a very popular incumbent in Tulsa. I  had no idea that anybody else felt the way I felt about it. When I was  introduced on the House floor the day of the swearing in, the floor leader  introduced me as a    giant killer.     That   s a major accomplishment. The opposite party, opposite gender,  and an incumbent.  That   s true. District 78 was several percentage points more Republican  than  Democrat . I had to overcome many obstacles, and part of it was  just friendly persuasion at the door.  And it was the first time a mother and son had served     Together. Yes. I think a mother and son had been here before, but not  one in each chamber. I was in the House and Kevin was in the Senate.  So that was kind of unique.  Did you live here or commute?   The legislature is in session  the first of February until the end of May. I  stayed  at the Grandison , a bed and breakfast at Thirteenth and Shartel.  Those people became my family away from home. I got to know their  children and their extended families. I love them. They   ve been very  kind to me during the time that I   ve stayed with them.  8  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  And do you drive down Lincoln to get here or     Yes. I   m very impressive and romantic, I guess you could say, because  when I see the Capitol, I envision those people who served before me  and I think about the reason I   m here. What a blessing it is for me to   serve in the legislature  after already having a career that I enjoyed  more than anything.  When I come down Lincoln Boulevard, I see the Capitol and think about  the people who served here before me. The people who were real  statesmen are the ones you remember, not the people who   ve given their  life to politics. I think about Henry Bellmon. He went against party lines  to support education with House Bill 1017, which helped me (I was a  teacher at the time he started that bill). And I appreciated that. He once  made the statement,    Politics is what you do before you   re elected. After  you   re elected, you govern.    I have often thought about that. There have  been many people in the past that have talked to me about what it   s like  to serve in the legislature and it   s those people that I remember.  Another gentleman who helped me when I first started was  Tommy  Frasier, a Tulsa  attorney. He was disabled from a military injury. He  was a good supporter of good ideas. When I decided to run, I went to his  office for a donation. I got more than I asked for. He gave me my first  donation, but he also opened his desk and he pulled out a little leather-bound  book. It was a copy of the Constitution, federal and the state. He  handed it to me and said,    I   m giving you this, I want you to read it all  and I want you to practice it.    I did read it, but it   s not much fun reading  the Constitution. I think I   ve read bits and pieces before but reading it  with a different agenda was very enlightening.  Can you talk a little bit about the first bill you introduced on the floor?  I don   t recall the first bill. However, Kevin and I did one together. It was  quite a challenge. I remember I had to do a long debate on the bill. At  that time we went late into the evening and one late evening  I was  attempting  to persuade different representatives to my way of thinking  about a bill that dealt with teenagers and alcohol. I had just completed  what I thought was a pretty good argument and one of the senior  members of the House stood up and challenged me, one who was in my  own party. He thought he would show the new member how to behave  and what it was like to get a bill passed. It was tremendous. He  frightened me, he belittled me, and, as was his practice, he humiliated  me. I was very concerned that my bill wouldn   t pass. When he finished  his part of the debate I stood up and  looked around to see something  happening  in the back  of the chamber . My son had come over from  the Senate. He had taken this gentleman to task about his method of  9  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  debating against his mother   s bill. I   ll never forget it. I got the bill  passed and it went to the Senate and Kevin passed it there. So we had  our first Easley and Easley bill.  At one point you decided to switch chambers from the House to the  Senate. How did that come about?  I had no intention of leaving my district until term limits. I loved the  House. I loved serving in the House. I had good experiences there. I  served as the Banking Chairman which gave me an opportunity to work  with the predatory lenders. At that time predatory lenders, as I called  them, were coming into the state of Oklahoma. We had passed a bill that  would allow them to operate in a way that I believed would be extremely  difficult for people who were struggling to make ends meet. I wanted to  stop the high interest rates. I wanted to work on that. I wanted to stop  them coming into the state. I thought I could do that being chair, but  faced some challenges, nonetheless.  Kevin decided, due to term limits, he would pursue another career. With  the excuse he needed help, he took me out into the district. We went to  chamber meetings and all kinds of meetings in his district, going all over  Mayes County, all over Wagoner County. He  felt I needed to  meet  those people and see the need to support them and represent them in the  same way he had. When it came time for him to leave, he talked to me  about running for the Senate. I decided I would do it, not because I  thought it was a stepping stone. That was not the reason I came to the  Senate. I came to the Senate because I had a passion to help people and  felt I could represent them well.  Was it different campaigning for the two?  We tried the very same methods. Door-to-door, that was my way to  campaign. That was my way to know people. I found it almost  impossible to go to every small town, every community, and knock  every door. I became somewhat disillusioned and discouraged with that  because there wasn   t time. It was impossible to walk that district two  times as I had done in my House district. I had a challenge before me   because Senate districts are much larger than House districts . We tried  to keep it personal. We tried to meet the people by attending every event  possible to discuss  their issues and concerns . I tried to do some of the  things that Kevin had started because the people of that district had  elected him three times and they liked his ideas. They liked him so I was  going to try to carry on his dreams for them.  Did you have an opponent each time?  10  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  I had an opponent every time. If I ran again, I would have an opponent.  We know that ahead of time. Kevin always had an opponent. We   ve  always had opponents and we always will. And I suppose that   s good  government.  Did you run against any women?  All but the third term  my opponents were male . The third term I ran  against a cite counselor   s wife. It was somewhat different, but it   s still  basically the same. You represent the people.  In the years that you   ve been here, what have been a couple of your  favorite bills that you have pushed through?  It   s hard to go back and think about,  but  I think the bills I   ve worked  were in education. I   ve had some bills   it   s a little bit tough getting  educational bills passed. There are many different ideas about education  and how we should provide every child an opportunity to learn. One   very important piece of legislation  which failed last term, is the bill for  autistic children. I have a real passion for children with learning  disabilities. I would like to see us do more for the autistic child. I passed  a bill requiring teachers to get special training  to work with autistic  children . That passed and is now law. It went in effect last year, in fact,  and I think it   s working well. There is one in 150 children now  diagnosed with autism and there   s no known cure. I   m hoping that will  happen soon so we can provide those children with the tools to help  them with their struggles with their education.  Also, I sponsored the Autism Insurance Bill along with another senator,  but it died due to a lack of hearing in a committee. I   m hoping  legislation will be passed soon to provide insurance for those families  struggling with an autistic child.  What committees have you been a member of?  I   ve always been a member of the Education Committee  and have  served as vice-chair. I was vice-chair of the Energy Committee, as well .  I also served as vice-chair of the Transportation Committee which has  been a real experience for me because of all the stimulus dollars that  we   ve received. I feel that transportation and our highways and  roadways are very necessary for economic development.  I am a  member of Public Safety where I have tried session after session to get  legislation passes to require training for bouncers in bars and clubs. As I  stated before, I was chair of the House Banking Committee where I  authored many bills dealing with regulating reverse mortgages and  predatory lending. I am still very anxious to see improvements in those  11  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  areas.  Do you have an opinion on term limits?  Oh yes, I authored a bill which has not been heard for the last two  sessions. I do think we are moving to the time when term limits could be  overturned;  however, it would take a vote of the people to accomplish  that . Many states  are choosing to overturn their term limits . In fact, I  think two states have decided that it   s unconstitutional. So I   m hopeful.  It won   t benefit me, but that   s not the point. I think we lose a lot of  history and a lot of experience when we term limit people when they   re  just beginning to learn this process. This process of government is very  unique. You have to learn that process. We should have the freedom to  choose whoever we want to choose to represent us.  Maybe you   ll stay around long enough to help others push it through.  I   ll be term limited myself. But, I will continue to be involved in issues  about which I am passionate about.  So you   ll help in that way.  I will help in that way. I will always be politically involved and I  honestly believe I will have a family member who will come back to the  Senate one day. I have a grandson who is very interested in politics.  He   s a freshman at the University of Oklahoma now and he has a plan  for his life and I think part of it will include  serving in  the Senate. So I  think we   ll have another Easley here from our family.  You also served when the Senate was 24-24.  Yes.  Do you want to talk about that experience?  I think all members of the Senate were very anxious about having that  tie, and there were some anxious moments. But having the leadership we  had, Senator  Mike  Morgan was a uniter. He was willing to work with  Senator  Glenn  Coffee. They worked together well. I was very  impressed with both of them when they brought the Senate together and  we were able to get work done and able to compromise. The first session  we had the tie, it worked well and I was very pleased. We shared  committees. We were co-chairs that first session. A Republican and a  Democrat co-chaired every committee. That was fair and the right way  to do it, in my opinion. As the next election came, and changes were  made, we lost a member. We Democrats have no chairmanship any  12  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  longer and it   s more difficult now to get things done for our party.  When you walk out the door the last day, will you feel like you   ve  accomplished most of what you set out to do?  One never feels like the job is done. I have a problem with that because  there are many things I wanted to get done and I   d still have advice for  people who come and represent us. I feel that I served my people to the  best of my ability. I worked hard. I feel like I was honest and I tried to  represent their ideas as well as my own here. So I feel like we have  made some progress.  If someone were to come to you   a woman in particular   and ask for  advice about possibly running, what are some of the things you would  tell her?  Of course, it would depend on the particular individual. I   ve had many  women come to me and tell me that they want to represent the district  when I   m term limited. I usually encourage them because I think it   s  wrong to discourage someone from running. But it   s a very difficult  process these days because politics is not what it once was. One must  spend most of the time trying to raise money  for campaigns . To be  competitive you have to have a good base. You have to have a thick  skin, I guess you could say. One must realize, when you enter a race,  your family enters with you. There have been some real difficult  problems for me to face when the press and my opponent attacked my  family.  You   re going to see yourself on television and the truth has been diluted  and changed   I mean it   s just not there. People can take anything and  change it to make you look like you are some kind of unfit candidate.  It   s very sad what   s happened in our state. Politics has become very dirty  and very political. It takes a lot of money and if you aren   t a wealthy  person it   s going to be hard to get together the funds, especially if you   re  in the minority party. It   s going to be difficult, but if you work hard and  you have a passion to represent the people in your district, you have  some ideas and issues that you would like to see put into law, then I  would say you can do it, but it   s going to be more difficult. Especially  being a woman, you have to learn to have a very thick skin.  By the way, an announcement has already been made in my district   about  who is going to follow me, and she is a very good friend of  mine. Her name is Janice Aldridge. She will be running and I will be  helping her. So we will have another female, hopefully, in my seat, with  some of the same ideas and ideals and passions that I have had.  13  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  She   ll have a good mentor.  I have had many mentors here, and one of them, of course, is my son.  Kevin served his district well and the people respected him when he left.  I   m hoping that can happen with me as well and we can get someone to  serve who will have those same ambitions.  Describe a typical day for you during session.  Many people skip committee meetings. I   ve never been one  to miss . I  guess that comes from my school training; you don   t skip faculty  meetings. I never did anyway. I   ve found that going to committee  meetings, it can be laborsome and boring sometimes, but it   s necessary   to become informed about legislation we will vote on . That   s why we  have the committee process. I   ve missed very few committee meetings. I  want to be there to start and end the process. I know many members  when they have termed out, that last session they don   t attend but I will.  I   ve told my district that, my supporters, I will work until the last day.  And I will. I still go to all the meetings and I go to birthdays and pie  suppers out in the district. I try to attend anything that I   m asked to do. I  go to the schools. I was just there last Friday attending a school in  Spavinaw and talking to the students about government. I will work until  the last day of my term.  Do you read a lot of bills? How much of your time     I guess I didn   t cover that whole day, did I? (Laughter) Kind of  wondered around a bit. I usually don   t socialize like some people do. I  like to go out. I enjoy the members here in the Senate, they are good  friends of mine, many of them, both parties. I enjoy people, I always  have but I feel I have an obligation to read the bills and contact my  constituents. I call them back. I stay here nights, many nights, till seven  during session calling people, emailing people, answering phone calls,  reading the bills. You can   t read the whole bill but you can read the  changes and by this time you know what those bills are, pretty much.  You just need to be careful about what the changes are.  Is listening coming in there somewhere along the way, as an important  skill to have?  It is. I   ve had a great deal of trouble with that. I just enjoy people and I  enjoy talking. I guess I do a lot of that myself. I wish that I had listened a  little bit more. People have problems and many times they call me when  they have a problem and they just want me to listen. They   re very  disturbed about national government at times and  over  that I get a lot  of phone calls and emails, people disgruntled about national  14  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  government.  I can imagine      I   m getting a lot of calls on healthcare and just all of the issues that are  going on, the wars and things that people are concerned about. Basically  it   s healthcare right now. People are very anxious about what the health  bill will do, whether we   ll even get it passed.  What will be one of the things you miss the most when you leave?  The other day I had someone in my office, a colleague, and we were  talking about this, what I will miss. I love the people here. I like the  staff, I like our leaders, I like the people, the EAs (the Executive  Assistants), I   ve just gotten to know them all and I will miss them. This  has been a community and it is like a community because when you  come to the Capitol, there are people here who are here almost every  day. Not just the senators and representatives, but the lobbyists and our  friends who come in to encourage us to do the right thing. It   s just a little  community all itself and I will miss these people. We have many good  people here who have assisted us in writing bills and research and  keeping us legal and keeping us within the Constitution.  What are you plans afterwards?  I have never been a person who doesn   t have a plan because there are  never enough hours in the day to do all the things I want to do. I   ve just  returned from a trip with relatives, my sister and husband, and my best  friend and her husband, to Charleston. I   ve found a new author, Pat  Conroy, whose books I enjoyed reading about Charleston. Before I   went  there I wanted to read his novel. There   s parts of it that I thought,     Well, I don   t know if I can finish this book or not,    but he   s a great  writer and I would recommend him. He talks about life as it really is. I  had to broaden my vocabulary a little bit by reading his book. He   s a  new author. I like to read. It   s one of my favorite things to do, to sit and  read novels. I get started on one author and I would like to read several  of his books or her books. I do that and then I like to visit the places  they   ve written about. John Grisham is one of my favorite authors. His  one true book was about the situation in Ada, The Innocent Man. That  book was very fascinating to me because it was about Oklahoma. He   s  been here. I think there   s a lawsuit even now, pending, about that book  and his problems with the DA down there.  Interesting.  I love to take an author and just read everything he   s written and then  15  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  take another. So I   ve got a long way to go to read all the books I want to  read. Then I want to travel, my husband and I. He   s been putting off  some trips. I want to go to Ireland. I   ve been to England, Wales,  Scotland, but I   ve never gone to Ireland and that   s where my ancestors  originated, in Ireland. I want to see Ireland and go back to the place  where my great-grandfather lived and just do a little bit of genealogy in  that respect. That   s one thing I have on my agenda and then I want to  spend, as I do even now, I want to spend as much time as I can with my  grandchildren. As you see, my wall   s just covered with  photos of my   grandchildren. They are my most precious heritage.  So when you retire the second time there won   t be a    going back to  work    a third time?  Oh, I would not say that because I have some ambitions. You know, I  don   t think you   re old until you stop. And I have no plans for a rocking  chair except if someone gives me a new baby grandchild  and then  I  will see that rocking chair is used again. But I believe we   re through  with grandchildren. I have some plans. I   m thinking very seriously about  doing some volunteer work at the hospital. Pink is my favorite color,  I   ve always said, and I would love to be a pink lady over at St. Francis  Hospital. I will try that more than likely. I will do some volunteering.  And then my son being at Grand River Dam Authority, he wants me to  conduct tours at the Tourist Center there and I will probably do some of  that.  That sounds fun.  It will be fun. I tell you, I will have fun wherever.  Still meeting people and     Still having fun with people.  My last question is, when history   s written about you, what would you  like for it to say?  I guess pertaining to this job I would say I came here for a reason, to  serve the people in my district. And I hope they will know that I did  serve them with honesty and integrity. That   s the way I feel about it.  That says a lot about people I think, if you can say they   re a person of  integrity.  Is there anything you want to add before we sign off?  No. I   ve been very fortunate to have good health and to have two careers  16  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  Finchum  Easley  where I loved serving.  I read somewhere one of your favorite poems was The Road Not Taken.  Yes, Robert Frost is one of the pastoral poets who is very simple in his  language but he has a way of giving you the truth. I think that in his  poem The Road Not Taken, that he probably pondered that. He   s just one  of my favorites. He spoke at John Kennedy   s inauguration. I   ll never  forget seeing him there that snowy day when he stood on the Capitol  steps with his poem in hand to read at the inauguration of one of my  favorite presidents, John Kennedy. He stood there, that white hair  blowing in the wind and that snow. It was so nostalgic. He lost his  notes   that   s pretty typical of something I would do, but he proceeded  to read his poem in honor of that day.  I feel that he has a message in all of his poetry. The Road Not Taken was  special to me because I felt it fit my life. There were opportunities for  me along the way to choose, to get to a point where I would have to  choose which way to go. I like the last line where he says,    And I chose  the road less travelled, and that   s made all of the difference.    I feel like  that   s what I   ve done. I haven   t always done that, no one could be  perfect in all their travels but I feel like that   s been an important point in  my life.  The citizens of Oklahoma are glad that you picked to serve them.  Thank you, Tanya.  Thank you for having me today.  I appreciate it.  -------  -------
