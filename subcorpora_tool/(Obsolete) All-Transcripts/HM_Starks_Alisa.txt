Story_ID: 128488
Speaker 1: Yes.  And before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions.  They're lightweight questions and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is gumbo.

Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I have a favorite phrase or saying.  I don't think so.
Story_ID: 128489
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your mother's side and your father's side.  I'm going to start with your mother's side.  And, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name today is Mary Ann Davis.  She was born Mary Ann Cooper.  She married my father [Levert Paul King, Jr.] and became Mary Ann King, and now she's since divorced and re-married, and now it's Mary Ann Davis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Mary Ann Davis, three words.  M-A-R-Y, A-N-N, and then Davis, D-A-V-I-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is, oh, here I go, May 25, 1935, and she was born here in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how far back can she trace her family?  How, what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back do they go?
Speaker 2: My mother can probably trace her family back to her parents' parents.  We do have family members who are aggressively researching our family tree and have more of the information documented.  We don't have a lot of the information, simply because on my grandmother's side there were a number of people who could pass, or not pass.  And so, they did lose touch with a lot of people years back.  So, but there have been family members who have been digging, going back to getting records.  And we just don't have the final book yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where do they go back to?  Do they--?
Speaker 2: They go back, my mother's mother, Odessa Weaver, was born in Rayne, Louisiana.  And there comes my like of gumbo.  And my grandfather on my mother's side, John Cooper, Sr., was born in Alabama. I don't know exactly what town.  He died when I was very early.  He was a janitor.  But we don't have a, I don't have a lot of information about him other than I knew his, one of his sisters who was, my mother was her favorite niece.  And so, when she died my mother had to take over her estate and got everything from my aunt, yeah, who lived in Jackson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories that are passed down through your mother's side of the family about--?
Speaker 2: Just the family?
Speaker 1: Yeah, about migrating to Chicago, or about going back further to, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's mother, Odessa Weaver, came to Chicago when she was very young.  She was pregnant and came to Chicago to find a better place.  In fact, the stories that have been told about my grandfather and everyone, other family members during that time, were that they came to Chicago for a better, to work.  And so, my grandmother actually came to Chicago to follow, she followed her sister here who was older, more like her mother because her family was very large.  So her sister acted as more of the mother figure and took care of, actually raised my grandmother's first child, my oldest aunt: Gloria Wilks.  And in fact it's kind of funny, because it seems like they, Gloria Wilks was like--Aunt Rena was the older sister of my grandmother.  And she was more of the mother to Gloria.  And Gloria was more of a sister almost to my grandmother, Odessa Weaver.  So, there were stories like that about coming to Chicago.  And in many cases, you know, someone was pregnant and following, you know, a sister or another relative here.  And they came here to work, and the rest is history.  Because my grandmother met her husband, John Cooper here.  They married and had other children, actually my oldest uncle who was also a John Cooper, who was younger than the first child she had.
Story_ID: 128490
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about your mother's [Mary Ann Davis] life.  You know, what was her life like growing up here in Chicago [Illinois]?  And what did she do?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was the third child of my grandmother [Odessa Weaver], and she has always been more of the matriarch because, again, Gloria had lived most of her life with her Aunt Rena.  But it was my mother and her brother, John Cooper, who were the oldest two of the union of John Cooper and Odessa Weaver.  And they grew up on the South Side of Chicago.  There were times when they--I was told they lived in projects in the city.  They weren't considered projects then, I guess.  But when I was a young child, probably about four, my grandfather passed away.  They had been divorced, though, by that time.  In fact, my grandfather [John Cooper] had lived with my mother and my father, Levert King, before he passed away.  But my mother growing up was more, took care of all the other siblings she had.  And I don't recall all of them.  There was Gloria, John Cooper, Mary Ann King, Mary Ann Cooper then.  There was Edward, there was a son that was, they had a young brother who passed, who was killed.  He was run over by a car when they were young.  His name was Bernard.  And actually his name--and Gloria, when she had her first child she named him Bernard, after him.  But there was Bernard, and then there was Sonia, and Sonia and then Gene.  So, my mother kind of became, took care of a lot of the younger kids.  She ultimately became kind of the matriarch that everyone looks up to in our family--her brothers, her sisters, the children of all those kids.  They often tell stories about my mom, you know.  And she was the type of person who would take--when something was going wrong--if somebody was to run away from home, they'd run over to our house and she would take care of them.  (Laughter).  But she became over the years kind of a matriarch figure.  And I don't know how that happened, other than she had all these younger kids to look after.  She went to Catholic grammar schools.  They went to St. Ann's Grammar School, and she went to DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois].  She went to college, and while she was in college she also worked.  She married my dad right before she was going to grad school.  She became a teacher and worked most of her life probably.  I can't even remember how many years she worked as a teacher, a kindergarten teacher, at Brown School [William H. Brown Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] on the South Side of Chicago, the Southwest side of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Brown School?
Speaker 2: Brown School, which is near where the United Center is today.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But she started there way before the new facility was there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like the West Side, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's the West Side, right across the street from, there's a project that's right there.
Speaker 1: Henry Horner?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And she stayed there for a long time.  And she just decided--and the timing was perfect when she retired because it was just about, it was just before my grandmother had a stroke.  And she decided to bring her back in, well, to take care of her full-time.  And then it was also at a time when she said the kids in the projects, they were, even at the kindergarten level they were cursing, they were coming from traumatic family situations where the young mothers are on drugs and not involved in the children's lives.  And it was just kind of interesting growing up in that environment, with that kind of situation.  In the early years it wasn't as bad.  But I always remember my mother taking some of our clothes to her school, buying extra supplies and things for, whether it was for school, to make sure that her classroom had everything that she needed for the kids, or buying things for the various kids.  And it was kind of interesting to watch that situation.  But she was always the kind of person that took care of everybody, so in different phases--as a teacher, as daughter to her mother, as a, you know, sister, children.  She's always been the caretaker.  I never, my mother has never asked me for any money.  I borrow from my mother.  (Laughter).  She's just that kind of person, she just gives. So.
Story_ID: 128491
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father [Levert Paul King, Jr.].  Oh, is there a story about how your mother [Mary Ann Davis] and father met?
Speaker 2: You know, the only story that I know is that--I don't have a particular story.  But I know that they, they didn't get married right away.  And they got married for, in her day, was older.  Because they got married, what was the day?  Actually, she had me when she was twenty-five years old.  And for that time period, that was old to have children.  And they had gotten married shortly before that, like a couple of years before that.  So, the only thing I remember is that they partied a lot.  (Laughter).  That's what I remember a lot about that.  But they married.  So, I don't have any special stories about then.  They divorced when I was about ten years old, and that was probably a traumatic time for all of us.  There were two.  I have only one other sister--no other, no brothers or anything.  And my sister and I are fifteen months apart.  So, we're extremely close, and everything we did together.  But it was, we moved when I was ten from, where did we live before?  We lived on 1758 East 73rd Street [Chicago, Illinois].  And when we moved to our new place, that's the day that we were moving, that's when I learned that my parents were divorcing.  And all I could recollect at the time is that I know my father hadn't been there for--you know, he hadn't been there for a while.  But I hadn't--there was so much going on with the move.  But he came back, and he came to tell us that he wasn't moving on with us.  And I know my mother was very upset about the whole situation.  But we moved into a two-flat.  On one floor, the first floor, my grandmother [Odessa Weaver] and two of my aunts were moving out of the house that they had grown up in their later life and moved into the two-flat, the first floor of the two-flat.  And my mother and my sister and I lived in the second flat.  And it was like a great, big house.  The basement was finished.  So, again, people would come.  And so, we would have cousins that for whatever reason--if they ran away, or if they came in town.  People--our house was the place that everybody came to.  They came to see my grandmother and they came to see my mother.  So, those are the kind, mostly the kind of stories that I remember.  My grandmother was an excellent cook.  When you talk about gumbo, there's more than one gumbo.  There is, you know, file gumbo; there's okra gumbo.  And there were people--white, black, who would bring all the fixings for gumbo just to have her make gumbo.  And those traits of cooking have passed on to my aunt and my mother.  And they carry on the tradition, which is very different than what my husband [HM Donzell Starks] is used to.  Because he was so amazed that every holiday, every excuse to cook.  (Laughter).  There was huge gatherings at our house.  And my husband was introduced to this very early, because we met in eighth grade.  And so, he's known about this family tradition.  It's like every holiday.  If it was Memorial Day, if it's Labor Day, you could go over to our house any time, and there'll be tons of people and tons of food.  Even on a normal day, the, go over there today.  They've got pots to feed, they're prepared to feed, you know, us, whoever.  (Laughter).  Because that's how they cook--for a number of people, for everybody to enjoy.  So, that always, it was a great sense of family.  So that probably made it more of a traumatic thing to us that our dad was leaving.  And it was probably, you know, he came--his family situation was a lot different than my mother's.  He was an only child of the union of Levert Paul King, Sr. and his mother, Virgie Mullens.  And when he was young, his parents divorced too.  And his mother re-married, and he had a stepfather who kind of took him under his wings.  But we were still very much, I was very much in connection with both of them.  They were like both of my grandfathers.  There was Levert Paul King, Sr. and there was always Mr. Mullens.  And so, they both became our grandfathers.  But his lifestyle was a little different because he was raised as an only child.  So there weren't a lot of siblings when he was growing up.  So, he probably was like my husband in a lot of ways, in the sense of "Oh, this family thing."  (Laughter).  But he was always very supportive of, my father was always very supportive of my sister and I.  I mean we were like, we're it, for both my mother and my father.  We're it, you know.  Everything kind of revolves around these two--you know, my sister and I.  And that was, and that gave us even more, again, a sense of family all the way around.  Because they were both dedicated to family, and had very strong values about raising families.  The types of experiences that we had were probably, I would say similar to a lot of people that have family-oriented things.  But we were also made aware very early of who we are--that we could be anything that we wanted to be.  And I know I may be rambling a little bit.  So, steer me off.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm going to steer you right.
Story_ID: 128492
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well back to one thing, and that's can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 1: Okay.  My father's full name is Levert Paul King, Jr.  Levert is spelled L-E-V-E-R-T, Paul, P-A-U-L, King, K-I-N-G.  And he was a junior.  His dad was Levert Paul King, Sr.
Speaker 2: And he is known in the community as, at least a part of the community, as Tawo.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  He's known in the community as Tawo, T-A-W-O, which gets into how they raised us as children.  And there's some interesting stories that have evolved in my life about how they raised us.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: His date of birth is January 30, 1936.  And the place of birth is Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, how much do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you take them?
Speaker 1: I can't take his side back very far.  Part of the reason is his mother [Virgie Mullens] was raised in a foster home.  So, there's not a lot that we know, even about her birth family or her adoptive family.  We knew, I knew growing up another, who was considered her brother, who she considered her brother, but it wasn't her real brother.  It was just, it was another foster child.  And my, his dad's family I know very little about.  There are very few relatives on my father's side that I've ever met, and it was because of those reasons.
Speaker 2: Do they have a tradition of coming from someplace in the South?  Or do they--
Speaker 1: I never knew a lot of detail.  I guess because of the background of my grandmother, I mean I would hear things from my father, but she was, there wasn't a lot of talk about family.  And she was my grandmother on my dad's side, and worked in a nursing home most of her life.  And we would see her probably maybe twice a year.  She was kind of a, a lot of times alone.  Because by this time she had divorced both Levert King and Mr. Mullens.  And so, she was more to herself.  And then eventually my father had found her one day in her apartment.  He had been trying to reach her and couldn't reach her, and went to the apartment and found her unconscious.  She went to the hospital, and when she got out of the hospital--and this is when I was probably in my early twenties--and we then started taking over her, taking care of her.  We made sure that she was living in a senior facility.  It wasn't a nursing home, but it was a senior housing facility.  And we took care of her, in fact.  And then after a while when she couldn't live there anymore--my mother [Mary Ann Davis] owned a thirteen-unit building--and we had her move into my mother's building and my father moved in there with her, so that there would be someone there.  And so that happened, you know, she stayed there until she died.  She actually died in the apartment, which was traumatic for my father in a lot of ways because my grandmother never wanted to be put in a nursing home because she never, because she said, "I worked in them, I don't ever want to go."  But it was getting to a point that my dad couldn't handle it on his own.  I had actually moved to California for a short time.  And I told my grandmother, I said, "You've got to let--."  We had all the services lined up so there would be a housekeeper, people to fix her food, everything.  And she would turn people away.  And we said, "You can't do that.  You have got to let them do this.  You know, we're trying, we want to take care of you."  So when we had made the decision, we found a facility that we really liked, thought it was really nice.  And we talked to her about it and she did not last, I don't think, probably a week.  She was not going to that nursing home, and I think that was very traumatic for my dad.
Story_ID: 128493
Speaker 1: So, she [Virgie Mullens, paternal grandmother] didn't know her parents?
Speaker 2: Not her birth parents, at least what I've been told, what I know--that she did not know who they were.  So we, I've never known a name, never knew, never heard of the circumstances.
Speaker 1: And on your father's [Levert Paul King, Jr.] father's side, well, on your father's side, he didn't. Did he know his father?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, Dad knew his father, yeah.  And I remember him--
Speaker 1: Senior.
Speaker 2: Senior.
Speaker 1: Well, of course he did.  But--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he, and they--
Speaker 1: What did he know about him, I guess is what the question is?
Speaker 2: Oh, he knew a lot about him.  And he lived with him for a while.  And my dad often talked about how it was funny, he had two dads.  I mean, he literally through that time had two dads.
Speaker 1: Mr. Murphy and--
Speaker 2: Mr. Mullens.
Speaker 1: Mullens, right, Mullens.
Speaker 2: And Grandpa King [Levert Paul King, Sr.].  He had two of them, and they were, you know, very much in his eyes a part of his life.  He has the stories of who got him the bike and, you know, playing the two against each other, (laughter), things like that.  But yeah, they were very much both a part, and I grew up knowing both of them and visiting both of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what's your father like, and what does he do?
Speaker 2: My father, what is he like?  I've always thought, and particularly when I was growing up, that like he was the smartest man in the world.  (Laughter).  And I knew him up through--I knew a lot of his jobs--like in my early years when I was like five and ten--he was, he has always been about kind of a social worker, educational oriented occupations.  In the early days he was directors of different Y.M.C.A.s [Young Men Christian Association], director of Southtown Y.M.C.A.  I remember when I was five and learned how to swim, he was the director of the South Shore Y.M.C.A.  When he left those positions, he was once director of the Head Start Programs for the Archdiocese of Chicago.  Then he went on for a while--and I don't think I'm missing anything, I can't remember--but he was working with C.H.A. and the Chicago Housing Authority, and then he retired from the Chicago Housing Authority.  But I know him--and even though I've known these positions, went to the jobs involved and all of that, the best memories are of him as a social worker and his volunteer efforts with and participation in different organizations like Catalyst, The Institute of Positive Education, working with these various groups. And I easily, I, even in school got labeled as kind of the "militant activist."  And a lot of it had to do with the influences of both my mother and father, and more so in the early years from my father, taking us around to different groups.
Story_ID: 128494
Speaker 1: And it was very early on.  I mean, they [Starks' parents, Mary Ann Davis and Levert Paul King, Jr.] were very conscious about giving us a strong cultural background, so that we knew who we were and that we could achieve.  I remember, I don't remember, but when I was in kindergarten, my parents actually had to protest to get us into the school we went to.  We went to St. Philip Neri Catholic School on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].  It's still open today.  But even though we were in the district of that school, they did not want to admit blacks to that school.  So, there were a handful--
Speaker 2: A Catholic school?
Speaker 1: It was a Catholic grammar school.  And there were a handful of blacks who entered that class, which would have been September 1965.  And they wanted us to go to the black Catholic school which was actually closer to us, but it was across Stony Island [Avenue].  And, but we were, you know, if you know my parents, "We're supposed to be in this school."  (Laughter).  So, they protested.  And there were a number of families that we still know--the Wrights, the Thurmans.  There were about five of us that entered into that class.  We got in, I'll never forget it.  It was like Monsignor Moran, who struggled with it.  And my dad always tells the story of how "Once you all got in and they saw how smart y'all were, then they raving about you, like, 'these are our black children.'"  (Laughter).  But that was an interesting time.  Because when we started, of course, in 1965, at that school in kindergarten, I did, and then my sister followed me the next year--the school was mostly white, obviously.  But by the time we graduated--I graduated in June of 1974, from eighth grade--not only was the school, but the whole community that we lived in, the racial makeup of the community was very different.  It was a very fast white flight out of the community.
Speaker 2: This is the South Shore [Chicago, Illinois] neighborhood, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, this is South Shore.  And overnight, so by the time we graduated, there were probably a handful of white people that were at St. Philip Neri that were in that graduating class.  And so that was just the beginning, at least, of my recollect-- recollection of the struggles that were going on.
Story_ID: 128495
Speaker 1: I remember things like when [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] died.  It was like, "King died," you know, it was traumatic in '68 [1968].  I was eight years old.  And I remember being touched by that so much that in grammar school--when I was in grammar school I guess would have been like, I would have been getting ready to turning, getting ready to turn ten--and I had been touched by so many of the things that were going on in the Civil Rights Movement--and my parents and what they were involved in--that I remember taking a calendar.  And this was a calendar that had different dates of black history in it.  And I was so upset, because at the Catholic school there was a dress code.  There was a uniform that you had to wear.  And on St. Patrick's Day, the little white boys would--as far as I was concerned they were out of uniform.  The tie they were supposed to wear was red.  They wore green ties.  And I said, "Okay, so why can't we have a day, you know?"  (Laughter).  Here I am, ten years old.  And so I was like, you know, my friends, "we going to pick this day."  (Laughter).  I can't even tell you what date on the calendar, it was probably, it could have been anything.  But that was the date we were going to celebrate black history.  And it didn't even have to be February.  And the thing was--I knew there was going to be an issue about it.  But we didn't go out of uniform.  The girls could wear red or green socks.  And these were the, come up to the, knee high socks.  And at that time the girls used to, a lot of times double up the socks.  So, I said "We're going to wear both socks.  And we're going to double up so you'll see the red and the green.  And of course, our skin represents the black."  And so the day happened, we did it.  And I get called to the office.  And my father [Levert Paul King, Jr.] just thinks--he talks about some of those things.  And he says, "I'm just like laughing."  (Laughter).  And my mom [Mary Ann Davis] was like, "Oh, God, the girl's got called to the office."  And, but there was nothing really they could do; we weren't out of uniform.  Plus, our grades, that was the one good thing.  You know, our parents always instilled, for us to get A's and B's, which my husband [HM Donzell Starks] will have a different story.  He was like, "I've never met a family, like getting a C was bad."  And so, we always had these good grades.  So, there was really nothing they could do.  But we were just kind of put on notice like, "We're watching you all."  And, but different things happened like that.  And so, I became labeled as a militant in our school.
Story_ID: 128496
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where did you start grade school where did you start?  You didn't start at St. Philip [Neri Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois].  You started at another school?
Speaker 2: I went to pre-school at the Firman House [Firman Community Services, Chicago, Illinois].  And it was actually I think one of the first--I think Head Start started about then, about that would have been 1963, '64 [1964] pre-school.  So, I actually graduated officially there from Firman House.  And as I recall, I think my father [Levert Paul King, Jr.] was very, he worked in getting Head Start.  I don't know that total history behind the development of Head Start programs across the country, but I think it was, like one of the first programs here in the city.  And then I went to kindergarten directly at St. Philip Neri [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you did--
Speaker 2: And all the way through eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 128497
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of a little girl were you?  And what are your--tell us, well, tell us about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: One of the things I always remember because in the early years from, I guess from birth to ten, my mother [Mary Ann Davis] and father [Levert Paul King, Jr.] were together.  And so, we had a lot of family outings and things going places, summer vacations, different places--White Cloud, Michigan I think it was.  And so I remember a lot of being together and doing a lot of different things together.  I used to remember a lot my mom and dad used to have parties.  My dad is a Kappa Alpha Psi, he was in that fraternity.
Speaker 1: Where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: He went to Corpus Christi [Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois].  My dad went to Corpus Christi for grammar school.  He went to St. Ignatius [High School, Chicago, Illinois] for high school.  And then there's college.  I get them all mixed up, jumbled up in my head.  And my mother, as I mentioned before, she went to St. Ann, DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and I hope I'm getting that DuSable right; I always get DuSable and Dunbar [Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois] mixed up.  And she went to--well, before Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois].  I forget what Chicago State was before.  It was some kind of teacher's college.
Speaker 1: Chicago's Teachers College [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Chicago Teachers College, so that's where she went and got her, she got her undergrad there and her graduate degree.  And--
Speaker 1: So, where did your father become a Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity] at?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: And I forgot how that was.  I forgot the name of the university; I'm so bad.  But he became a Kappa.  And as a result--and my uncle, my mother's oldest brother, John Cooper, is a Kappa.  It's like we were flooded with Kappas all my life.
Speaker 1: So, he used to host the parties and--
Speaker 2: Well, these were parties, like, house parties.  So in the apartment that we lived, there was parties.  And as my sister and I grew older, we may have spun records.  We were just around.  (Laughter).  Maybe peeping out of doors, I don't remember.  But I remember the parties.  I remember things like--because things like Christmas were really big on my mother's side.  I remember the Christmas trees at our house and my grandmother's [Odessa Weaver's] house.  I remember that, you know, being a time when we always got together with not only her family, but we made the rounds of my grandmother [Virgie Mullens] on my father's side and my grandfathers [Levert Paul King, Sr. and Mr. Mullens] on my dad's side.  So, those are the memories that I have.  And then of course when they divorced, it's the same kind of memories the same kind of things going on but we're on the outings with our dad and we're doing things with our mom.  So those were the early, the early memories, and--

Speaker 1: School, again, like I said, the most common thing that people would say about me--because I'm very close with a lot of people we went to grammar school with--and we often get together and they often talk about, "You were that militant."  (Laughter).  "You were that militant person steering me into trouble."  So, again, you know, we had our day.  And even it was so funny.  By the time I went to high school, which was right next door--I went to Aquinas Dominican High School [Chicago, Illinois] which was right next door to St. Philip Neri [Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois].  And the nuns told me the first day of class when I went to my religion class.  She was like, "Lisa, don't come over here starting that stuff."  So, I just had a reputation.  And unfortunately that had an interesting effect on me, where I was so outspoken in grammar school, always doing stuff, always raising, "Look. If there's a problem here that we're not being treated fairly, if they're getting preferential whatever."  And I'm always raising the issue.  By the time I got to high school, the nuns were like, "Okay, we're sick of this."  And I just shut up.  I just shut down, which was kind of interesting.  I still got the good grades, always got the good grades.  But I said, I'm not going to have them knowing or expecting that they know what I'm going to do, or what I'm going to say.  So, I kind of just quieted down.  And it wasn't that my belief sets or anything was different.  It was just like, "You're not going to think you know everything about me, and think you know what my next actions are going to be."  And by that time, too, Aquinas was mostly African American.  There might have been two non-African Americans in almost the entire school.  So, it was a very different environment.  I still always made it a point to be involved in whether they were black student organizations.  They were still there at that time, and I was still involved in certain kinds of activities.  I wasn't involved in things like sports.  And this goes again to what my parents--we always were involved in something.  Every summer my mother [Mary Ann Davis] would send my sister and I--we were either doing tennis or just us girls camp, sewing we were always involved in things.  And then we were with our dad [Levert Paul King, Jr.] with various organizations, whether it was eta [Creative Artists Foundation, Inc.]--whether, you know, all kinds of things.  And so we had a very what I would say today, a very enriched childhood.  We were always doing something and always had these various kinds of experiences. And like I said, very family-oriented.
Story_ID: 128499
Speaker 1: Now, tell me.  Now, in grade school were there any, or at St. Philip [Neri Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois], were there any teachers that were exceptional in terms of, as far as you're concerned?
Speaker 2: The only teacher that I remember was an African American teacher, probably the only one that I had while I was at St. Philip.  And her name was Clare Murdock [ph.].  She was younger, and I recently heard she passed away.  She had asthma, so she had an asthma attack and died.  And she was great.  She was hard on us.  There were a number of kids I was tops in my class in grammar school.  And she pushed us.  One of the things that my sister and I always notice when we look back at our early report cards, is that the school didn't know how to deal with us because we were smart.  And in those days, you know, everybody kind of learned the same lesson at the same time.  And when we would look at our report cards they were like--we got these report cards where they had A's or pluses.  The school changed the reporting system a number of times.  So, sometimes it was A's, sometimes it was pluses and minuses.  But we always had these exceptional report cards that would go like plus, plus, plus, plus, plus.  But then when they had the commentary, it was like attitude would be the problem.  I'm like, "Look at what they wrote about us."  (Laughter).  You know, we were bored probably.  You know, or that she's always talking.  But the grades say, you know, we're exceptional.  There were a lot of teachers that really didn't know what to do with us in school.  So, we had a lot of free time to plan revolutions.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you question how the--well, I guess you called into question how the school is run in different ways?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we questioned a lot of things.  And like I said, there was only the one teacher, Clare Murdock, who would, you know, give us high school work.  High school math is what we most know about Clare Murdock.  She challenged us and let us do things out of the box.  And that, that we appreciated with her.  And she was younger, like I said, so she was--and this was the time like '74 [1974], when they started having a lot of the folk masses.  So, things were getting cooler and hipper in general about Catholic--well, the Archdiocese in general.  I'll say "cooler" kind of lightly.  But so the younger priest, or the younger teachers, were the ones who we had identity with.  The other ones that we had grew up with--
Speaker 1: Now, what were some of the things you called into question when you were in school?
Speaker 2: When we were younger?  Well, one of the things that was a big thing, and it was almost too late to do anything about it our--the grammar school--in every eighth grade class they would give the top eighth-grader a scholarship.  Let's say it was a five hundred dollar scholarship to go to high school.  When we graduated we were like, "Okay, Kavan [ph.], it's either going to be you or me, because we're the top two students and we're both black."  They decided not to give away the award.  And so, we don't know what happened the year before.  But it was things like that that were just infuriating.  And I can't remember all the incidences that happened.  But it was little, maybe not so little things that happened throughout our entire year at St. Philip Neri.  And so by the end of that, I guess I just got frustrated.  I went to Aquinas [Dominican High School, Chicago, Illinois] and then this nun is saying "Stop it," you know.  (Laughter).  It was like, "Don't come here with any of this stuff, you know, it's over."  And I can't remember all of it.  It's just, some of it is kind of blurry, but it's certain things like the socks I remember.  And the girls, the other girls, that were in our class could tell you more stories probably about what I did, yeah.  But, you know, after a while I just blocked it out, got very quiet.
Story_ID: 128500
Speaker 1: Now, was the-was the church important when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: Did you attend Catholic Church?
Speaker 2: Well, it was Catholic Church, and some of the masses were mandatory.  Our family, even on both sides--well, my grandmother [Virgie Mullens] on my dad's [Levert Paul King, Jr.] side was very religious.  And she would go to church or read the Bible every day.  That's all I remember, her reading the Bible.  Because I never went to, wherever she would go to church, never saw her go to church every day.  But she was the Bible, carrying one.  And the other side of my family I would say was very spiritual, but they weren't regular churchgoers.  And we went to Catholic schools to get a better education more so than it was about being a devout Catholic.  And oftentimes I remember long conversations with my dad, particularly, you know, again after this '68 [1968] when my parents [Levert Paul King, Jr. and Mary Ann Davis] were divorced.  And when my sister and I went to college, we would come back and make sure we went to visit him and spend long hours at his apartment just talking about different stuff.  And religion was one of those things where it was like, yeah, these people there's one thing about going to church every day, and then there's another thing about being spiritual.  And we would talk about all these issues, because my sister and I were not, like our families.  We were not the ones to go to church every day, every Sunday.  That was never mandatory.  There were times when he had to go to church because we went to Catholic schools.  And my mother [Mary Ann Davis] would take us, but Dad wouldn't go. (Laughter).  And again, she had went through Catholic school, too, but it was part of getting a good education, and that was above anything else the strongest message that our parents sent to both me and my sister.  And there were high expectations because both of my parents, you know, had went to grad, you know, went to college and got graduate degrees.  So, there was never any question among my sister and I that we were going to go to college and we were going to get higher degrees.  And we were going to do whatever we wanted to do; there was just never any question about that.  So here we are today, both, you know, both have graduate degrees.  You know, both doing well.
Story_ID: 128501
Speaker 1: All right, well, when you were in high school [Aquinas Dominican High School, Chicago, Illinois] did you know where you were going to go to college?  I mean by the time you were a senior, did you have it narrowed down?
Speaker 2: I didn't have it narrowed. By the time I was a senior I had two choices--really one choice of where I wanted to go to college.  And there's probably a little story that even gets me to there.  In high school, what I loved to do was write.  I used to write a lot of poetry.  In fact, one of my earliest works was written in a publication that [HM Useni] Eugene Perkins published with Third World Press.  And so, I just liked to write.  While I had you know, great in math; great in all my subjects.  I was valedictorian of my high school class.  And my sister was salutatorian of her class.  And she should have been valedictorian.  I always said "She's smarter."  But I loved to write.  And so I was in search of and I was very you know, I guess I considered myself very idealistic--I want to do something in life that makes me happy.  And I don't want to be an accountant.  In my high school yearbook they said they thought I'd be an accountant.  And that's because I guess of the math scores.  And you know, I had a lot of friends.  In fact, I ran into a friend of mine last week and we had someone we knew had died that was our age.  And she said, and she always tells me this when she sees me.  She said, "I just don't understand how you got all those good grades and could still hang out and party."  I said, "Well, there was no choice.  In order to go to the parties, I had to get the good grades.  So, that's it."  But I always got good grades.  And like I said, in my high school yearbook, they thought I would be an accountant.  And I don't know why they picked that profession, but I never had any aspirations to be behind a desk, to be in an occupation where I wouldn't interact with people.  I always knew from early on that whatever I did, I was going to do it in the African American community.  I always knew that I would eventually own my own business some kind of way.  And when I talked to my counselor, I said--he asked me what I would like to do--and I said, "I'd like to write."  He said, "So, what about journalism?"  And so I was like, so I can write, huh?  And my whole thing was and I guess it had to do with that nun.  I always go back to that nun who told me don't say anything.  So, my form of communication became then through writing.  And so, I was looking for a way to save the world through writing.  And so I said "Well, where are the best schools?"  And of course he told me, "You know, there's Columbia [University] in New York, and Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois] here."  I said, okay, I'm going to Northwestern.  So, I actually only wanted to apply to one school, and that was Northwestern University.  He advised me, "What if you don't get in that school?  Have another choice."  I knew I was getting into Northwestern University.  So the only other school I applied to was Marquette [University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and the University of Milwaukee [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And the only rationale for Marquette was the journalism department, and I had my cousin who was living in Milwaukee.  Other than that, I knew I was going to Northwestern.  So, that's where I went and ultimately got in.  So, my aspiration was initially writing, initially journalism.  And once I had completed college--
Speaker 1: Okay, now wait a minute.  Let's not complete yet.
Speaker 2: Let's not go.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Don't complete yet--
Story_ID: 128502
Speaker 1: But Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois], when you were there--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was still-- it was a good place to be for journalism.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the Medill School of Journalism [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].
Speaker 2: That's right, Medill School of Journalism.
Speaker 1: And you have, in the Black Studies department you have [P.] Sterling Stuckey--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  All the--
Speaker 1: Quite a few people who are of note.  And I don't want you to breeze by Northwestern without, you know--
Speaker 2: Talking a little about it.
Speaker 1: --some of those people and experiences.
Speaker 2: And it's kind of interesting at Northwestern, because it's kind of a little tradition.  My oldest cousin, Bernard [ph.], went to Northwestern, and he went during the time of the seventies.  He's about ten years older than us.  So, I knew a little bit about the history of the, you know, the riots--different things that were happening during those ages, you know, on college campuses.  And there had been a sit-in at Northwestern where the black students had, you know, just kind of went up to the student center and just like kind of closed everything down.  Like, you know, "We're demanding this stuff."  So that just fit right into my program.  I'm "Okay, y'all did all that?"  You know, Northwestern, that's where I'm going.  And yeah, there were a lot of interesting people--Leon Forrest--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Professor--
Speaker 1: Writer
Speaker 2: Writer--
Speaker 1: And '[The] Bloodworth Orphans' [Leon Forrest]
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: and all these other books.
Speaker 2: So, it was, you know, it was an interesting time.
Speaker 1: And this was--
Speaker 2: Of course, I joined the black student union the first time I get up there.
Speaker 1: Now this is 1977 or '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: No, actually '78 [1978]--
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978], okay.
Speaker 2: --is when I graduated from high school.  So, my first year would have been, you know--
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 2: --fall of '78 [1978].  And so, I took a lot of courses.  I was the type of person to take a lot of courses that interested me.  I made one mistake, I would say.  It's that I took a history course in my freshman year.  And the courses are coded.  Like, at that time it was like A, B, C, and D.  And D meant like a graduate school course.  I had no idea what I was taking.  But I said it was on South African History I want to go.  (Laughter).  I want to, I want to be a part of the class.  And I'm in there and don't know what I'm doing.  (Laughter).  And I say it's a mistake only because I didn't get like an A or a B.  So, I was like "Oh, my God, this is I'm not ready for this course yet."  But I was taking things that interested me.  And I recognized in hindsight, "Okay, Alisa, you could have waited for that a little later and taken that course."  But I was still with that mindset of, "Okay, I want to do this."  I took all those courses.  I got a minor in African American Studies in addition to the journalism.  One thing good about Medill School of Journalism is that you could--in addition to the journalism courses, there was room to choose what they would call kind of an elective, you create a minor in a certain area.  And so, I did African American Studies.  But I also took what most journalism students don't take; I still took a lot of math.  I'm like, "Who are you?"  You know, I took statistics.  "But why are you taking this?"  You know, so I still took a lot of those courses.  And writing was okay.  What I learned--because Northwestern's real prize at that time was really on the editorial side of journalism, and I really hadn't made up my mind how I wanted to use journalism in terms of a career.  I just knew I liked to write.  But through, going through Medill I learned that, oh, there are people who's going to edit my stuff people who may not like what I write.  (Laughter).  They question it.  Is this what I really wanted out of this?  And so by my senior year I had taken the only advertising course that Northwestern had offered, and it was a joint Medill/Kellogg program.  And I loved, for some reason I fell in love with advertising and decided to take a master's, specifically in advertising.
Story_ID: 128503
Speaker 1: I had and that was kind of consistent. You'll find that in my life I keep saying, "This is all I want.  Northwestern is the school I want.  This is the career I want.  This and this."  And I closed the world to every other thing.  And once I had made up my mind that it was advertising, some people advised me "Well, maybe you should get an M.B.A. [Masters of Business Administration] just in case you change your mind."  I said, "No, I'm not going to change my mind.  It's going to be advertising."  And Medill [School of Journalism, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] had a program, a one-year master's program if you went straight through.  And advertising was one of the sequences.  So, I took advertising with the thought that I was going to work for a black advertising agency.  I knew again--because I had known a long time before that--whatever I was going to do, I was going back to the black community.  So, my father [Levert Paul King, Sr.] knew there was a Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity] who owned an advertising agency.
Speaker 2: Which one was that?
Speaker 1: Oh, my God, why am I forgetting his name?
Speaker 2: [Vince] Cullers [Advertising, Inc.]?
Speaker 1: No, not Cullers.  This is in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Oh, New York.
Speaker 1: And he passed, too.  But he was going to have me go to New York.  No, I'm going to stay right here.  Burrell is at that time Burrell Communications--or Burrell Advertising, as it was then--was the number one African American agency, targeted agency.  And I said, "No, I'm going to work for Burrell [HM Thomas J. Burrell], that's where I'm going to work." And so, I got through the advertising sequence at Northwestern and went through some of the interviews with some of the companies.  You know, they have you interview.  I'm like, "This isn't what I want to do.  Call Burrell Advertising."  It just so happens that my mom [Mary Ann Davis], her best friend's daughter was dating someone that worked at Burrell.  So, we called him up.  He was like, "Well, I don't know.  You know, I'm not the person to talk to, but you know.  And I don't know if they'll take any entry-level people."  At that time Burrell was not hiring any entry-level.  They were hiring they were still fairly new.  This is like now 1983 when I graduated from graduate school.  They had opened in '71 [1971], and still fairly young as an agency.  They were hiring most of their account management people away from the larger white advertising agencies.  And so he said, "I'm not sure, you know, but you can talk to my boss."  And his boss was [HM] Eugene Morris, who now has his own advertising firm.  And Gene is kind of like, "You know, yeah, you know, I like you, I think you're smart.  I just don't know if we're ready to hire a new person.  I don't know whether we have it in the budget."  And I'm like talking to them, right, and time is going by.  I'm like graduating and, you know, I'm not doing anything else.  I'd actually got offered a job from J. Walter Thompson, and it was going to be working on, like, Kraft or something like that, and I turned them down.  And they wrote me a letter.  (Laughter).  I don't know what I ever did with that letter.  But I know they must have thought I was like crazy. "You're turning us down?"  I'm like, I'm waiting for these folks over here at Burrell to get their act together.  And then one day, Gene called me.  And it probably had been like months, like six months.  And he called and he said, "You know, I was really pushing hard.  I really wanted to bring you in.  But I don't think they can make it work.  I don't think they can make it work budget-wise."  And I said, "Well, who do I talk to after you?"  Because he was, at that time, he was like executive director and there were probably two of them.  And I said, "Well, who do I talk to?"  And he was like chuckled, you know.  He was like, "The only person you can talk to after me is like Tom Burrell.  That's about it, you know."  "Okay."  I hang up the phone and call over there.  And it was so funny, because today they'll talk--tons of them will tell you stories about me--Tom from Tom Gene, all of them.  I called Shirley Searcy, who recently passed away, but she was Tom's assistant at the time, and because it was so small, everybody knew that I was calling all around.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 128504
Speaker 1: But I called Shirley [Searcy] and I said, "I need to, you know, to set up an appointment with Tom Burrell [HM Thomas J. Burrell]."  "Okay, I've heard your name and I'll see what I can do."  And so she calls me back later, and she says, "Well, you know, he doesn't--you know, he thinks there is really nothing we can do right now."  I said, "You need to make this happen," you know.  And she goes, "Maybe I can get him on the phone."  She gets Tom Burrell on the phone and we start talking.  I don't know what I said, but I had the next morning I had a breakfast interview with Tom Burrell.  And I had already prepared for what I was going to present him with.  And what I did, I created--even though I wasn't on the creative side, I was applying for a job on the account management side--I had a book created, like a portfolio, like art directors because I knew that was his background, was in art direction.  And so, the book told the story of me and my accomplishments, and why Alisa Starks--I was then Alisa King--and Burrell should work together.  And it also included in this book, like, some of the old ads from when the agency first opened--stuff that he hadn't seen in ten years that I had gotten from old issues of Ebony and Jet and stuff like that.  And he was like, "Okay, you know, I think you got to meet one more person."  I was like, "I thought you were it.  Aren't you Tom Burrell?"  (Laughter). You know, and he said--and now I know why he wanted me to meet this person; this person was Sarah Burroughs, who would ultimately become president of Burrell Communications Group when he would become chairman.  And he had me interview with her, and she just fooled me to death.  I knew when Julius liked me, Gene Morris [HM Eugene Morris] liked me, Tom Burrell I could read it.  "Okay, I'm in like Flynn, right now."  But with Sarah Burroughs, I could not read her at all.  And she you know, I said, "Okay, so you'll get back to me?"  And she said, "Yes."  And the next thing I knew I had the job.  But so, there are stories that they can tell you, of who this persistent person is.  Gene will even tell you, "Her mother ran into me one day.  (Laughter).  "I didn't know her mother."  And just how I was persistent in getting the job.  So, that was kind of the trail through advertising.
Story_ID: 128505
Speaker 1: So how long were you with Burrell [Advertising]?
Speaker 2: I was with them initially--I was with them from March of 1984 to March of '89 [1989].  My first stint, five years.  And I got married in May of '88 [1988].  And shortly after my husband [HM Donzell Starks] and I got married, he got offered an opportunity to run the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] office of the firm he was working with.  And so, I left he left ahead of me.  And then I left in March of '89 [1989].  And then after we stayed in L.A. for all of '89 [1989] and '90 [1990], '91' [1991], we came back to Chicago [Illinois] and I came back to Burrell.  And so, I worked for them for almost another six years until it was time to get ready for,  well, actually the theaters were being built at that time.  So, they were very well aware that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we were starting--
Speaker 1: Well, I want to now in terms of your husband.  Now--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You met him in eighth grade.
Speaker 2: I met my husband in eighth grade.  A friend of ours was going with--because there was no dating in eighth grade.  All you could do is talk to somebody on the phone.  But she was going with the best friend of my husband, Donzell Starks.  And we met, we met at a park.  I went over around where he lived, with her.  And we met in the park and that was eighth grade. It.  And then we had exchanged telephone numbers.  We talked on the phone over the next, let's say, couple of years like the freshman year of high school.  I think I saw him I think the next time I may have even physically saw him--because I don't remember seeing him a lot--maybe seeing him at parties.  He would be at the different parties I would be at.  But it wasn't until like sophomore year of high school that--when you're almost getting to that stage where you can date and do things and go places--that we were an official item.  And so, he, that's when we met.  We met in eighth grade and then started being high school sweethearts, sophomore year of high school.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 128506
Speaker 1: Now, you met your husband [HM Donzell Starks] in eighth grade.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you all-- excuse me-- got talking in school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you finally get married in 1989?
Speaker 2: Right.  We were high school sweethearts, went to each other's junior and senior proms.  We knew that we were eventually going to get married, or at least I knew, I guess.  But actually, I should even mention he told me one of the first, what do I want to call it?  One of the first parties we met at, he said, "I'm going to marry you one day," and I thought it was the most weird thing.  I said, "Is this like a rap line?"  (Laughter).  And what I know today, probably it was just a line.  But you know, I was like, "You don't even know me.  I don't know you.  And we're too young to be even talking about any marriage."  And I knew I still had college to go to, grad school to go to.  But we went through all of that.  You know, my husband, even though I went to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] and he went to Western Illinois [University, Macomb, Illinois], we still saw each other.  And then the grad school, he went to IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] and I, you know, did my year at Northwestern.  But yes, we eventually got married.  And he, since he had known me and we had been talking since eighth grade, he knew one of my aspirations was always to eventually own my business, my own business.  And even though I worked in advertising at Burrell for a number of years I never envisioned, and I don't know why, I never envisioned owning an advertising agency.  But I knew that whatever I was going to do was always going to be in the African American community.  I thought it was going to be a restaurant.  My grandmother [Odessa Weaver] had always said, "Well, why don't you--because we always loved food."  They were like, "You know, you should be making money off of these people coming and get this gumbo."  And she, you know, believed that she didn't have the wherewithal to create a business.  "But I got you two bright granddaughters.  Y'all can create a restaurant."  So, I always envisioned that it would be a restaurant.  And then my husband was always interested in money, which turned into an interest in banking.  He liked the idea of exploring a business.  But as we, as he pursued his banking career and I pursued my marketing career, we would constantly blame each other for not getting started on some business idea.  We explored things like McDonald's franchises, because I didn't know how to cook.  And fortunately, every day when I came home from school, the spreads were already there.  Grandma had it laid out.  And I was left-handed, so it made it very hard for them to teach me how to cut a chicken, how to do, like, "Girl, go sit down somewhere."  And so, I never picked up the skills.  So, I said "What am I going to do?  I need to learn how to run a restaurant.  I need to learn how to cook.  Maybe we need to explore a franchise operation."  So, we initially were you know, had gotten in all the materials for a McDonald's franchise.  And Dock's was fairly new in Chicago [Illinois], Dock's Fish.  And at the time they were looking at a major expansion of Dock's Restaurants.  And so, when they found out that we had some interests, they kind of latched onto my husband and I, and were like, "We're going to open up a franchise."  And then unfortunately, right after my husband and I got married we moved to California, and we began to talk to Dock's about getting California territory rights, because they weren't in there.  And they were interested in it.
Story_ID: 128507
Speaker 1: But unfortunately, or fortunately, we [Starks and her husband, HM Donzell Starks] met another gentleman while we were out in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And he sat down and talked and said, "What are you two, what are y'all thinking about doing?"  And we talked about our big idea of opening up Dock's, you know, on the West Coast.  And he was like, "Franchise?"  And we know now he had a bad taste in his mouth about franchise operations.  And he was like, "I know there are like wooing you right now, and everything sounds hunky dory.  But think about the franchise and/or franchisee relationship, you know.  Ultimately, they need to get as much as they can out of you.  And so, it almost becomes slightly adversarial."  And when they got through talking to us about franchises, then we learned that he had owned gas stations, and that they were like eight minority franchisees, and they ended up suing the head company.  I think it was Phillips 76, and suing them--all of the eight minorities.  We were like, "ooh, we don't want to touch this."  And that was another, just excuse, for us to throw that idea away.  And my husband always says, "You're the marketing person.  Now, you need to develop a business plan and go do it and get us started."  And I would say, "Well, you're the banking person with the cushy investment banking job.  You're done by 2:00, you've got the whole day.  Whereas marketing people like I'm in the office sometimes till midnight."  You know, he could never understand "Well, why you got to do this?"  "I got a presentation the next morning, so I've got to do it."  And so, I would always blame it on him, and he would always blame it on me for not starting it.  While we were in L.A., this same guy, his name was Bill Preston, who was telling us don't do the franchise--he by profession was in the entertainment business and he was a business he was an accountant, I should say by profession.  But he also was a business manager for several recording artists like Boys Choir of Harlem, and Chris Cross.  And so he gave us the Hollywood side of life.  And he was also managing, or doing some of the accountant work for a theater in Chicago [Illinois].  It was the only first-run black owned movie theater in the country.  It was the Baldwin Theater in L.A. [Los Angeles] on Crenshaw [Boulevard].  It was an old single screen theater that had been converted into three screens.  And at this time while we were out there, they, the owners of the Baldwin were a company called E.R.C. [Economic Resources Corporation]. They were a real estate venture capitalist company.  But this was kind of their little project over here at the Baldwin Theater.  And, you know, we're not thinking nothing about theaters.  We were kind of happy.  It was, like, the opening of "Boyz n the Hood" had opened up and they were having a special screening.  And this theater had like a private area up top where you could sit almost in the balcony and look out and eat.  And it was like, "Oh, there's the rest of the folks, and here we are."  And so, we're just loving it and still never any idea about developing a movie theater, and nothing's going on in our mind.
Story_ID: 128508
Speaker 1: We come back to Chicago [Illinois], I go back to Burrell [Advertising], and Don's [HM Donzell Starks] working in another company.  And the goal in coming back was I really wanted to have children, and I wanted to be close to my family.  And we still owned the condo that we had left.  My sister [Deborah Lynn King] was renting it out from us.  We came back to the condo.  And I was driving along [E.] 71st Street, and I passed an old single screen theater that had been boarded up, oh, probably more than over ten years, fifteen years, the Hamilton Theater.  And the light bulb went on.  It was like there was this guy putting up a "For Sale" sign.  And, you know, with all this training that I had had with working with my African American--I knew their purchasing habits, you know, a bunch of statistics. And immediately it was like, what's the number one form of entertainment outside of the home for African Americans?  Going to the movies.  "Didn't we just see in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] black people owning a movie theater?  We can do this."  And when I talked to my husband [HM Donzell Starks] about it, he was like--you know, he really hated coming back to Chicago from L.A.  I mean L.A. was his lifestyle.  And I guess the idea of movie theaters was getting him close to L.A. again.  And he immediately said, "Yeah, you know, let's do this."  We placed a couple of calls called even talked to Albena [ph.] and some of the other "moms" I have in the community.  And Albena even said, "Do you think you can get in that business?"  And, but she had even heard that that theater was owned by Reuben Cannon.  And Reuben Cannon is a casting director in Hollywood, who's originally from the Chicago area, who had bought the theater, and who had looked at converting the theater into three screens, similar to the way the Baldwin was, but for some reason he was just, "You know, I've had enough.  I'm going to sell it."  And we had the plans for it.  "Oh, they were going to convert into a three screen?  Interesting."  And we kept looking, and I began to do due diligence on the industry, and starting doing research.  And we even called the owners of the Baldwin Theater.  The first person I talked to was actually Ken Lombard, who is today president of Magic Johnson's development corporation, The Magic Theaters.  And Ken was like, "Well, you know, I don't know if we're interested in expanding.  And, I don't really know."  And it wasn't the best conversation.  I said you know, and I'm a very persistent person.  So, I didn't stop there.  A friend of ours said, "Well, why don't you talk to the chairman, Lance Drummond, and see what he thinks."  So I called Lance Drummond and he said, "You know, I know you're probably not interested in national expansion.  But we do need to see more minorities get into this business.  Whatever assistance I can provide, let me know."  So, I'm thinking everything is cool.  And shortly after that because this has to be we moved I moved back to Chicago about September of '91 [1991].  By January of '92 [1992], I learned I'm pregnant.  And just the pregnancy and things have like got me spinning.  And the focus is not so much on "Okay, researching this idea" as much as it is "Okay, I've got to get through this pregnancy."  But during the course of the pregnancy, there was an article that came out in Black Enterprise and it announced that the owners of the Baldwin--and it had a picture with Ken Lombard, Lance Drummond, and one other guy, I can't remember who.  Oh, it was the film buyer they had.  They had developed a partnership, and I think it was with Century Theaters to develop like twenty movie theaters in inner city neighborhoods throughout the L.A. County [California] area.  And I'm like, "So, now he's not going to be interested, really interested in coming to Chicago."  And so, my hopes were kind of down, but I was still pursuant of the idea.  Shortly after that announcement came out in Black Enterprise, the deal went sour.
Story_ID: 128509
Speaker 1: And by the time I had my son [Ahmad Starks] in September of '92 [1992], we were getting calls from Lance Drummond, "I remember you guys were interested in the theater.  I remember your husband is an investment banker.  Do you have an interest in the Baldwin?"  And so, immediately we were like, "Oh, well, why don't we make our first theater in L.A. [Los Angeles California?]"  It's operating and, you know, we signed our confidentiality agreements with them and got a chance to really look at the numbers and everything in terms of the research we had done.  It was like, "This is the business.  This is the business."  And the numbers were like, "Oh, wow."  By that time we had convinced our--well, we had also started looking into the possibility of doing building from the ground up.  Because we also understood other behavioral patterns about our audience in terms of, we like state-of-the-art.  I mean, we know the best.  Because we go to the movie theater so much, you know, an ideal scenario would be to build a multiplex theater.  You know, stadium seating was coming, you know, was getting big.  Stadium seating and all of that--the best sound and all that--and can we really do that in a three-screen facility?  And we understood how to make money in this business.  You need--single screens aren't making money at that time; doubles are not making money.  So, triples are making much more.  You need a multi-screen theater.  So that was the age of multiplexes coming to be.  And so, we're struggling with this and we're looking at these numbers.  And Don, over in his banking profession had met a number of banking people, obviously.  And we lived in California.  One of the people that we knew was Len Daniels, who was a big hitting investment banker in the California area.  And who was one of his clients?  Magic Johnson.  So, Lem Daniels was interested in possibly taking this idea to Magic Johnson.  So Magic [Johnson] was really at the table in a sense--represented at the table when we went to go talk about Baldwin, because we were talking about putting together a team of people who would buy the Baldwin.  And when we looked at the numbers, we said, "Yes, it's working.  But based upon what we know, the amount of money they want for the Baldwin, we can go almost anywhere in the country except New York [New York] and L.A. and build a state-of-the art multiplex theater for this amount of money."  We passed.  And we said, "You know what?  We're going to pass."  And shortly after that, Ken Lombard, separately from the owners of the Baldwin, from the Baldwin, struck a deal with Magic, and they went with Sony Loews and developed what it is today Magic Theaters.
Story_ID: 128510
Speaker 1: We then got approached by a number of people in Atlanta [Georgia].  They were looking at developing an area that was in the MLK [Martin Luther King]/Ashby area in Atlanta [Georgia] that was surrounded by [historically] black colleges and universities [HBCUs], Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Clark [Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And they wanted this area to be developed in time for the Olympics [1996].  And they had heard about this husband and wife couple who want to develop movie theaters, and they thought this would be a nice addition to this development that they were creating.  So, then our hope was our first site is in Atlanta.  Now, even though we're knowing our first site is going to be in Atlanta, we're there's a site that we have in mind in Chicago [Illinois], and it's at [E.] 87th [Street] and the Dan Ryan [Expressway].  And it has all of the things that we've researched [that] a successful theater in terms of the demographics, transportation accessibility, you know, schools and locations, you know, things that are around.  This site has, this was going to be the bomb.  But we're thinking, being from Chicago, "Oh, the politics in Chicago--we're never going to be able to pull this off in Chicago.  It's just too much political stuff we've got to get through."  And we're thinking, here is Atlanta with open arms saying, "Come, we'll work it out."  Well, there's politics everywhere, you know, in hindsight.  And it took years with the Atlanta project.  And the only thing that kept us from having the site first in Atlanta was the fact that there was political in-fighting about who was going to be the contractor for this development.  And so, that became a major issue in the scheme of Atlanta politics.  And so, the project got held up, and never got done before the Olympics.
Story_ID: 128511
Speaker 1: --And we're [Starks and her husband, HM Donzell Starks] slowly creeping trying to identify in Chicago [Illinois] who owns the land that we're talking about, that we like on 87th and the Dan Ryan [Expressway].  And unfortunately for us, each little they were broken up into such little pieces.  And each one was owned by different railway companies.  There had been there are railway tracks there today, but there had been more I guess in years past.  And by the time we figured out who all the little pieces were, my husband was sitting in a meeting with then Alderman [Timothy C.] Evans.  And Home Depot was there making a presentation to a group of community folks, like we had done, a whole bunch of community folks talking about bringing in a Home Depot to this land at 87th and the Dan Ryan.  And they presented a plan where they'd have a Home Depot.  There were forty acres, and they only needed twenty.  And they hadn't had any plans for what the other twenty were going to be.  Well, the community says basically, "You know, Home Depot, we want to be your first minority store.  We want to be it, but we can't give you the green light until we know what's going to happen with the other twenty acres.  We don't want it just sitting there.  Come back to us with a plan."  They didn't spell out how that plan should look--whether it should be residential, commercial, whatever--but come back to us with a plan.  Well, my husband is sitting in the room.  By this time we have, we've got this business plan that everybody's loving across the country.  I don't remember seeing a business plan--at that time nobody had seen a business plan like ours.  Today there've been better business plans.  But at that time, we were like "Boy, these people this plan is tight."  And by this time we have met with a number of banks in Atlanta [Georgia], in Chicago.  Tom Burrell [HM Thomas J. Burrell] has introduced us to a number of people.  We went through all the circuits in terms of the African Americans "who's who."  We had met with all of them.  And we're at a point now where some of the banks are saying, "You have convinced us that you are capable of doing this business, that you know enough of this business."  Because we've had several meetings where if they didn't understand anything, we've brought industry experts in.  We said, "Here, here, here." Alleviated any objections you may have.  "As if there was any objection at this point, to, you know, you doing this.  It's just that you've never done it before.  You know, you've convinced us that this is a viable market."  By that time, Magic's opened his first theater in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] on Crenshaw [Boulevard].  It's doing well.  We were able to pull the numbers and show them the numbers.  "This is going to be a no-brainer."  But anyway, Don's in this meeting with Home Depot and he hears that.  And he hears that they've got to do something with this land--twenty acres where we want our theater to go.  And the only stipulation that the community made was that there needs to be some form of African American participation.  They didn't spell out how that should be operated.  So, our next meeting was with Home Depot, knocking on the door, saying "Hey, guess what?  You don't have to come up with a whole, you know, due diligence and research and figure out a plan for the other twenty acres.  We're your plan.  Give us first right of refusal on the land and we're black.  So your problem is solved.  You can go back to the alderman and say, 'You know, those theater guys you've been, you know, thinking about, we'll give it to them.'"  And that's what happened.  They signed over--I know the guy at the real estate probably wanted to shoot himself now for doing that.  (Laughter).  But we agreed on a price and we got control of the land, just that easy.  We allowed them to get their first store up, inner city store up, then it allowed us to have control.  So, now, we've got control of the land on paper.  Now, we've got to still get the dollars.
Story_ID: 128512
Speaker 1: The industry is starting to hear this.  The film industry is starting to hear about this husband and wife couple, again, that are trying to put up this movie theater.  And Loews, who has Magic [Johnson] as their partner and have formed a fifty-fifty relationship with, under, Magic Theaters, tried to get the site, tried to block us.  They go to Home Depot and offer a higher price.  Cineplex Odeon, no black partner, but looking at it.  And my husband [HM Donzell Starks] always remembers who the athlete was there was an African American basketball another basketball player out of New York [New York] that they were thinking about maybe linking up with.  And--
Speaker 2: Patrick Ewing?
Speaker 1: I think it might have been Patrick Ewing doing the site.  And so, they offered more money than what our deal was.  But our deal was on paper, and it was ours to lose if we couldn't get the financing.  So, Cineplex, since they didn't have a done deal with anybody, called us.  It so happened we were in Seattle.  I don't know how they found us at my husband's his birth mother lived in Seattle [Washington] at her house.  And we get this call, and it's like, "How did you track us down here?"  And they're like, "We've got to meet you."  And so, their local real estate broker met with us when we got back to Chicago [Illinois].  And Don was, he was kind of angry because the guy was so evasive and not definitive about what they really wanted to do.  And I said, "Don, don't worry."  You know, in a separate meeting I said, "Don't worry.  No matter what, we have got to go to Toronto [Ontario, Canada], because the people who make the decisions are Cineplex."  And by this time, again, you got to remember, the banks have told us, "If there's only one objection, the only objection is that you've never done this before."  So, we ended up having that meeting that I told him was going to happen, in Toronto.  We go there.  And I said, "They're not going to have an agenda for us, so we're going to be able to set the tone.  We're ready.  We've been through years of talking to banks.  Everybody we know our stuff, it's tight."  By then we've got presentation stuff up the yin yang.  So, we go in knowing that most companies at that point maybe didn't have PowerPoint but they have a slide projector.  We go in, I ask the woman as she's putting us into this conference room, "Do you have a slide projector?"  She's like, "Yeah."  "Can you, before anybody comes in, can you bring the slide projector in?"  She brings it in the room.  And usually I would give a lot of the presentations.  And we set it up; they come in.  We introduce ourselves and said, "You know, let's take you through something for a minute."  We give them the presentation.  And by the end of the meeting, or the end of the presentation I should say, they were like, "So, you want to do what we want to do," is basically what they say.  And I'm like, "Yeah, we definitely want to do it."  And I said, "We want to make it sweeter for you. We're going to bring you what if we make it an all or nothing deal?  We have two other sites that we'd like to explore doing in Chicago."  And that was [W.] 62nd [Street] and [S.] Western [Avenue] and [W.] Roosevelt [Road] and [S.] Homan [Avenue].  "And what if we make this a three deal thing.  You say you can probably get the financing.  If you get the financing, hey, we got a deal."  And what they didn't know is, again, that the banks had already told us, you know, basically there's no other objections; you just haven't done it before.  You know, if there was one issue, you haven't done it.  And we've got the land in our hand, which they know of, ready to go.  And the basic thing--when we walked out of that room we said, "The deal is done.  They don't recognize how far we are."  I really think they underestimated that we had the banks lined up, and that we were ready to go.  When they said an all or nothing deal on the three sites, you know, or give us the first right of refusal, either make the three things happen, or that.  It happened, because all we had to do was go to the banks and say, "You know what?  That one objection you had, it's gone."  Cineplex has been doing this for what, how many odd decades?  It's gone and it's gone.  And now it's not one theater, it's three, it's a bigger deal.  And so in the cab going back, it was like, "We have finally--" because this is a process that has went from seeing that Hamilton Theater in September of '91 [1991] till now we're talking early 1996.  So, a five-year, you know, scenario of conceiving that this is going to be an idea, to, you know, Baldwin, no, not Hamilton, to Baldwin, Atlanta [Georgia], to now.  Here we are; it's done.  They don't know it.  Cineplex doesn't know it, the deal is done.  And it was so funny because we told them we scheduled the next meeting we'll talk to banks.  They're thinking we're just starting the process of exploring who will finance this deal.  No, we've now got people going to fight for this deal.  Because this is a significant thing, about putting three theaters in the inner city communities.  It's a time when the industry was still, you know, it hadn't had that "summer of 2000" bust year.  It's still growing; everything's still hunky dory.  Magic's numbers are looking like, "We'd better get into this business quick."  So, we go into the first meeting we have with a number of banks at the table to vie for this.  And Cineplex is sweating because they're not grilling us anymore they know us.  We know the story, we know what they got.  Now, it's you, Cineplex Odeon.  They were like sweating (laughter), sweating, but the deal was done.  And then of course we opened three multiplexes in the inner city on the South and West Sides of Chicago, November 24, 1997.  That's the story--
Story_ID: 128513
Speaker 1: Now they've been successful.  I mean, the people go to the show there.
Speaker 2: They go to the show.  Well, and interestingly enough, the most successful site is the [E.] 87th [Street] and the Dan Ryan [Expressway], our site.  And it's the homerun site; it takes care of the other two.  We knew when they gave us the other sites that they would trail Chatham [Chicago, Illinois].  Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois] each of the three communities that we went in were very different African American communities.  Lawndale was the most challenged of the three communities.  The site that we were on was empty and hadn't been developed since the riots in the 1960's.  This was bare land.  We were really being trailblazers at that site.  But that was also the site the mayor was aggressively wanting done by one of these exhibitors.  And that's how they got them, because the mayor wanted something to happen in those communities that would bring these kinds of jobs, entry level jobs, into that community.  And there was nothing over there.  I mean, Dominick's came in after us.  All these people that are you know; they benefit from us being trailblazers there.  But you go there today and you see an entire shopping center.  You know, the Bank of Lawndale was there.  Then there's us, then now there's Dominick's, there's Payless, there's Blockbuster, there's all of that.  There's only one out-lot that isn't the out-lot that's there.  But it's due to a contract that they couldn't bring in the tenant right away.  And now that, well, what happened is McDonald's had an exclusive.  They're on one side on one out-lot, and this other out-lot is designed for another fast food chain.  And McDonald's kind of just prohibited that other chain from coming in until a certain period of time.  That time has expired.  So, that will be completely--if you look at that now, they've got market rate housing.  The community is drastically changing right now.  You can't even get into some of the new homes for less than $200,000, $300,000, for some of the new developments that they're building over there.  You look at the other site at [W.] 62nd [Street] and [S.] Western [Avenue].  It was kind of like the middle of the road between Chatham and Lawndale, literally and figuratively.  Western Avenue, a strip that runs from the furthest point north of the city to the furthest point south.  I mean, known for car dealerships, known for business, but nothing really shopping mall kind of deal.  We put our theater at 62nd and Western.  More development comes in there, Pep Boys, Aldi's.  K-Mart was supposed to come right next to us until it went bankrupt.  And then you look at Chatham.  Chatham, of the three communities, most developed.  The household incomes are larger.  The, you know, these are more homeownership in that community.  All of that, you know, a stable community.
Speaker 1: It's more black home ownership there than any other place in the city.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, and then you look at the numbers, the dynamics, the whole nine yards.  The two malls were almost, they were more than fifty percent vacant when we went in--both sides of the street.  After a week, Home Depot comes in.  Now, you've got Marshalls' first inner city store.  You know, you've got Bally's.  You've got all that kind of stuff.  Cub Foods came in after us.  That mall is like, what, ninety-nine percent full of  You know, on one side, one store big store I think that always keeps changing hands is that Ames on the other side.  But in every community that we went in, there was development, which was something that we kept preaching to the banks.  They knew how important that getting us in was to each of those communities.  And all we were doing was using the model that was very similar to the way that governments have developed the suburban communities.  You get in your large acre tenants and create a shopping center, and voila!  And a lot of times it was a theater.  Where are most of the movie theaters?  In these shopping centers in suburban communities.  They helped build that, because the other people will come if there's a movie theater.  So we got, after these theaters were built--oh, every city, every local official was like calling us all over, "Please come."  The problem is I can't be everywhere.  And if you've got a theater here, I can't have another one two blocks down the road.  But we've been interviewed a lot from like when they a lot of people interviewing us about, well, coming to see the theaters, and seeing the change in all three.
Story_ID: 128514
Speaker 1: Well, what were some of the challenges of, you know, getting started, you know, once you got approval and all that?
Speaker 2: The challenges in even getting the deal done because we thought the challenge started from day one.  And when we started talking about the idea of doing movie theaters in the black community, people were like, "That's not an industry that black people are going to be able to get in."  And again, this was before Magic [Johnson] got his first one up.  And then even then it was like, "Well, that's Magic, you know.  He's got money, he's, you know, that's Magic."  It's like, "That's Michael Jordan.  They can get into avenues that maybe the ordinary African American can't get into."  People were telling us, "The Mafia controls the business.  You know, just stay away from that business.  What makes you think that, you know, they're going to let you have a movie theater anybody?  What makes you think you can get films?"  I mean, even the banks were really, you know--it was just some interesting questions about why you're going to get the movies.  All it takes is money.  You know, you pay for film, you get the prints.  So, if we can get the dollars, we can get the movies.  Even though there are--there is--some of this old-boy network kind of thing and relationship thing that's in the business that exists, but that was some of the biggest challenges, getting people to believe that it was even possible.  The other issue, challenges, were people believing that they would not be successful entities in our communities that people are not going to respect our facilities.  And so, fortunately, having worked for Burrell [Communications] and having worked for a number of different clients, particularly McDonald's, I could share stories that it's not really about so much the security that you need, lighting.  You do need those things, but it's more about the relationship that you're going to establish in the community that's going to keep the community protecting your theaters.  And we told the stories of the Baldwin Theater surviving the L.A. [Los Angles, California] riots, and why that happened, and why--you know, there were published articles on why McDonald's restaurant survived when, as quiet as it's kept, people may not know that a lot of black restaurants did not survive the L.A. riots.  And the gist of the article that had come out on McDonald's was it because of the relationships with those black McDonald's owner-operators in the communities.  So the community knew, "Don't touch that, I know them.  Baldwin: don't touch that."  And I said that's almost more important than the lighting and the security.  And so, we talked about the kinds of things that we wanted to do in the community and, you know, that people would know--too many people.  There are friends who work in that theater, and that's why you wouldn't see things happening.  I told them the story of the Baldwin Theater during the opening of 'Boyz n the Hood' when we were there, when there were published reports that they were expecting violence to be all across the country when that movie opened.  I guess that was one of the first major gang kind of thing, you know, modern day gang kind of picture that they thought was going to generate a lot of violence.  And interestingly enough, just a few incidents that happened in L.A. when we were there, happened not at the Baldwin Theater.  It happened in the outskirt areas where the workers were too scared, you know.  They were just anticipating situations, and they did crazy things like make these folks stand in line when it's almost time to start the movie.  And, or you've taken their money and you won't let them in the theater yet.  Or you're nervous.  And those were the kind of incidences that drew complaints and, you know, anger from the black community.  But at the Baldwin Theater: no incidents.  Before every movie screening, Lance Drummond got up in front of the audience and basically said, "This is your theater.  It's up to you, you know, to take care of it."  And how, that nothing happened at those theaters.  And so, it's from those kind of things that we were able to slowly garner support.  The idea of a movie theater in general is disturbing to most communities across America.  Because they immediately think of young people and what happens when they get out of the movies--where do they go, and you know, and we're going to have all this traffic in our community.  And it took a while to convince people that this is where you want them to be.  And it took saying, "Well, do you want them on the corner?  Or, do you want them working or, you know, watching a movie and out of the way?"  And so finally, people got it.  And they said, "You know what, we want them."  And, but it took a while through those years of getting people to understand the importance.  Like I said, a lot of the banks, after Magic got his theater up, understood that the money is there.  It's a viable market, they will come.  But the social things, it took a while.  And it was really hard.  It was even hard after we got our initial partnership was with Cineplex [Odeon].  And when we opened our doors, we didn't know that by doing these deals that they were actually putting themselves in a prime position for being acquired because they had come out of a shaky situation, financial situation, just that company.  And so, by May of 1998, right after we opened our theaters, they had merged with Sony Loews.
Story_ID: 128515
Speaker 1: But even dealing with Cineplex Odeon, their marketing department couldn't understand why should we do things different?  Why should these theaters be any different than any other theater?  And there were a lot of reasons that they should be because these weren't your typical suburban theaters where you're going to attract people from way around.  In essence, these are really just larger community theaters like the single-screen that used to be in your neighborhood.  They're going to cater to a certain radius, and there's going to be a certain audience.  And some things we can do to make this special for them because they're so used to already traveling so far out of their communities to get these services that now that you're in, take advantage of the fact.  You know, make them feel like this is their home.  So, some of the things that we did, for example, was not only creating an environment that seemed more urban--you know, with the facility, the look of it and how we painted it and all of that--but we worked with WGCI-FM radio to pump in the audio music that comes in.  So, it was their music.  It's like, "Oh, my music, too.  This is not the elevator classical music."  (Laughter). So, it was just little things, you know, in terms of working with--
Speaker 2: That's so important.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: There's a restaurant, too, on the South Side [of Chicago, Illinois] who caters to a vegetarian crowd, an African crowd.  They opened a sit-down restaurant, and everybody's excited.  And they were playing elevator music.  And it changed the ambience of the place completely.  And you know, people couldn't understand, who do you think you're serving?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  Right, who are these people?
Speaker 2: He knew his clientele were musicians and artists and those kind of people, and he's playing, you know, classical--
Speaker 1: And so I guess nobody had seen Spike Lee's movie, right?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We don't want those faces on our pizza restaurant.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.  But this is a black man--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who decided he'd go upscale and he missed his clientele.
Speaker 1: He missed his calling.  And you know, we have a lot of friends, too, who aspire to be in business, and a lot of times they look for--they're not trying to cater to the masses in what they try to do with the business.  And we recognize that we are dealing with middle of the road African Americans, and that these are not necessarily the African Americans that go on ski trips every year.  These are not the African Americans that go rafting, and that we need to cater to that audience.  And so, if you're another, you know, if you're in this other sect of African Americans, probably it's not the greatest experience.  Because our theaters, there's almost--I don't want to call it a culture, but we have different movie-going habits.  So, in our theaters, people talk to, you know, I don't know if it's going back to the whole griot, call and response of our culture or what.  (Laughter).  Unconsciously of course, but we talk to the movie theaters, and this [is] a phenomena.  And it's not in the Hispanic culture, it's not in the, you know, the white European culture.
Speaker 2: Now, there is some in the Hispanic culture, I think.
Speaker 1: You said there's some--
Speaker 2: There is some, yeah, there are some who do that, yeah.
Speaker 1: There is some doing it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Maybe those are the Puerto Ricans, you know, and not the Mexicans, primarily.  (Laughter).  But people really have issue with that.  And we're saying, "That's the bulk of our audience.  What are we going to do?"  So, that's the one thing that's a challenge today, too, for us, is we can't satisfy everybody.  Even in trying to cater to a specific niche, it's really hard to cater to everybody within our community unless they--what we've been trying to do is we have a special senior day.  So, seniors, you don't have to come when the young kids come.  We have a "Twilight Tuesday" day so that if--and "Twilight Tuesday" is like off the hook at our Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois] site.  Again, one of the most challenging communities where income is probably--you know, they look for every bargain they can get.
Story_ID: 128516
Speaker 1: Now, what is Twilight Tuesday? What is that?
Speaker 2: Twilight Tuesday, up until recently--because we're getting ready to change it.  They get into the movies, and they can see any first-run movie for four dollars and get a free complimentary popcorn.  And so, Chatham [Chicago, Illinois], even though, you know, it's like the homerun site with all the people.  They get a crowd.  Tuesdays are doing much better than normal because our business. The industry's business is usually weekend business: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  But all of a sudden, you see a spike now on Tuesday.  But where you see the biggest spike is at Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois].  And it's just like, oh, it was pricing over there.  Because initially I thought, well, when we opened our theaters that maybe we really didn't have to adjust our pricing as much for Lawndale.  Even though it--you know, when you look at the demographics and you look at the kind of household income and stuff like that, it would suggest that maybe you should lower your price there.  I was like, these are the same people that go way outside of their communities paying for public transportation or paying for gas to go far away, and they're still paying the higher ticket price; they're still paying for the popcorn.  So, now they're closer, it's in their community.  They can get there at our matinee times if they needed a smaller price.  But now that we've done Twilight Tuesdays, which is even a less price than our regular matinee, we're like, "Oh there is a segment that is just, they pay attention to this, and they are coming in droves."  There are lines at Lawndale on a Tuesday, it's just unbelievable.  Before the theater opens, a hundred people or more are outside the door waiting to get in.  Tuesday is their day now.
Speaker 1: Now, one of the, one of the issues that theater-goers face are children in the theater in the evening.  Is there a way you've dealt with that?
Speaker 2: Well, and that's another hard thing to deal with.  Because they're industry guidelines as to who gets into an R-rated movie, you know, specifically an R-rated movie.  And we discourage, like the rest of the industry, people from even taking, you know, even a six year old.  You know, we don't want anybody under six going into these movies at all.  But you'll have you know, in our community, we knew this going into, that there's an issue because they can't afford to come to the movie theaters, in many cases, and pay for a baby-sitter.  So, that's another struggle that we face in trying to help.  We even had some ideas initially about maybe even having a place in the theater where kids could play while--like a playroom, while the parents were in the movie theaters.  And unfortunately, because we were partnered with Cineplex [Odeon]--I mean they didn't kind of get with that program, and why we need to all this.  So if we had our druthers and could build a theater by ourselves without a partner, initially we would have maybe done something differently, recognizing certain nuances in our community.  But yeah, it's a problem that we face.  And so, what we try to do is, again, come up with ways that everybody can, not everybody can be satisfied, but as many people that can be satisfied.  So, we have a senior day when they know, hey, this is their time.  And this is a special discount for them, so they'll flood on that day and take over.  And there's "Twilight Tuesday," if pricing is really what your issue is.  You can come at matinees anytime during the early weeks.  And at all of our theaters, you won't have that.  But if you come, particularly at Chatham--well, and all of them--but particularly at Chatham--because of the volume of people that come through that facility every weekend--it's a party.  It's a party, Friday, Saturday. I mean, young people come; I know they come for the movie, but it's a whole socialization thing.  And I wish, you know, part of it is these kids have nowhere to go.  And we're one facility.  What we've got to do in our communities is have other options for them as well.  They will hang out, outside of our theater.  It's like what is, you know, you think what is going on here?  This must be like, you know, party-central.  But that's what it feels like, even if you're walking the halls.  And it's like party-central among the people there.  So, all I can say is on the one hand, we feel very good about the fact that we've been able to provide a service, something in our communities.  And we want to see more people get involved and do other things because our communities are so deserving of so many other things.  A movie theater is only one, one thing we're lacking-- we were lacking in our communities.
Story_ID: 128517
Speaker 1: Oh, the hat controversy, I want to ask you about that.  The first it was the opening weekend of the [E.] 87th Street theater.  There was a hat controversy over whether you can wear a hat in the theater or not.  And this is something I'd never seen in a theater before, controversy over hats.  But I was asked to remove a hat.  There were other people in line when I took my hat off.  There was a brother in front of me who's a Muslim--he's got his hat on, and he says, "Well, this is part of my religion, and I wear this hat."  And so, they had to bring either the manager had to come out.  Everybody had to come out.  And there was a long discussion about this hat, you know, situation.  And I don't know--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: But it had to be resolved, I know it was.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, it obviously was resolved because we don't have the hat policy anymore.  The hats was an area of particular concern to the security at all three of our theaters.  And we hired different security companies to manage all three, and that allowed us to evaluate the different services.  But one consensus was no hats.  And the police, particularly the off-duty police officers that were working with these firms, felt that if they took off the hat there was less risk for people to be carrying any concealed kinds of weapons or that was an issue.  And actually, when you say a hat controversy, it was a hat controversy at Chatham [Chicago, Illinois]--one of our facilities, the largest, and not at the other two--where we expected maybe there'd be more resistance from the young people because the young people, "Well, I don't want to take off my hat."  But no, what we found is that it was primarily adults--men--who didn't want to remove their hats (Laughter)--middle class people.  And so, it was just kind of funny how Chatham, the most educated, better working environment, you know, community was the one that struggled with it.  So, those were the things that we, those were a learning experience for us.  We wished we could do it, but we know now we've got technology on our side.  We've got cameras, and these cameras are very good at detecting.  They can detect bulges what that is kind of, "Oh, that shape is not what it's supposed to be."  And so, we can, if it's a body you know, lots of times they may be carrying something to drink or something like that into a movie theater.  And so, we're able to detect that right off the bat.  So, the person that's monitoring the cameras can say, "Jimmy, look at da-da-da.  Go out there before he even gets in the theater and tell him, "Whatever you got, go put it back in your car."  They can watch from the camera and see him put it back in the car, whatever it is, and be there.  So, today there's technology that helps us accomplish some of the same goals, and not that anybody is coming into the theater to do anything.  And I've got to knock on wood, that we haven't had any major incidences.  But, you know, we've got other ways of just kinda protecting ourselves because we do want this to be a safe environment for everybody.
Story_ID: 128518
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of programming, now, you have a chance every now and then to show an independent black film--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in your theater.
Speaker 2: The whole aspect, film aspect, of this is an interesting avenue, too, because there are different viewing habits of the African Americans versus the audience in general.  Films that have done, have phenomenal successes generally don't have phenomenal successes at our theater, like 'Titanic:' big ones; 'Star Wars:' big one.  And while there are African Americans who want to see--large amounts of African Americans who want to see it--they're not large amounts like in the general market.  Now, if 'Barbershop' comes out, "Rah."  (Laughter)" Where's 'Beauty Shop?'" We're doing off the hook numbers, particularly at Chatham [Chicago, Illinois].  Chatham, for any film that specifically targets our consumer market or features African American talent, will generally be number one or number two in the entire Chicagoland area.  Our numbers just go. And so you'll see that there's a different, you know, we've had to train over the years because we've had, after Cineplex [Odeon], there was Loews we were partnering with.  And then for a short time, we had General Cinemas managing our theaters.  Until finally we said, "You know what?  No partnerships."  Now, we're just going to hire a company and do what we say.  But over time, these film buyers have had to learn how to program for our theaters.  Because they can't just simply say, "Oh, Paramount's got a film," you know, or "MGM's got a film.  Buena Vista's got a film.  We're just going to plug them in here and everything's hunky dory."  There's a lot more work to--there's a lot more talent and skill to programming a theater for our audiences.  Unfortunately, I'd like to be able to have just every theater.  But you can't with a fourteen-screen or ten-screen theater you've got to be selective and make the right choices about what will be or we'll flop, we'll fail.  And so they learn over time how to program our theaters.
Speaker 1: We're experimenting with more and more independent black film product.  I'm on the governing board of the Chicago International Film Festival.  I chair their Black Perspective section.  And we've learned over time that there's, you know, some work, we've done a lot of experiments.  Chatham does the best.  Again, the most educated community that has been blessed with black independent films because it's not--they're not--the most commercial films.  They don't necessarily always have recognizable talent, which you'll see on TV.  It's not Beyonce; it's not 50 Cent.  (Laughter).  So, Chatham, that crowd loves independent films, and will support independent films.  The other two, it's a cultivation process.  And so, we experimented slowly, slowly, slowly, but it's--we know that when we do those films we're taking a hit.  But it's, you know, I think it's worth it in the long term, to develop that audience to get a greater appreciation for black independent films.  We've done some things in the industry, though, that I think are pretty significant.  Because before we came on the scene, oftentimes independent films had to rent our movie theater to show their films.  They call it "four-walling" in my industry.  And I used to just think it was like, "This is the most ludicrous thing.  Why do the filmmakers rent from us, when we rent the films from the studio?  Why is the relationship changing now that it's an independent black filmmaker?"  And so, I fought with Cineplex and Loews to bring in independent black films.  And I, even though we were still partners and they really controlled the day-to-day operations because they knew the film side, you run with it.  I would have to fight tooth and nail to say, "Hey, here's a film.  I think it's worthy.  Give them a real film deal."  Because, you know, now I have a relationship with the Reuben Cannons and all these people who are--not only as a casting director, but as him making films.  And you know, they don't understand the industry.  They don't know how the industry really works.  So, they were "four-walling" and renting it, and not understanding the true dynamics of how the industry--so, we've been, I mean--hours and hours of conversations with various filmmakers about, "Okay, this is how it really works," and, you know, we're going to try--
Story_ID: 128519
Speaker 1: The first film we did was 'Follow Me Home.'  It was an independent film done by a director named Peter Bratt, not an African American, there was an African American female who was going to produce and distribute the film independently.  The film starred Alfre Woodard, and it was a story of three artists who--four artists--one white, two Hispanic no, no, no, one--they were all minorities.  There was one African American, one Native American and two Latino artists, who were on their way to the White House to color the White House with what they thought was their image.  And it's a bit--the whole movie was about their journey.  You know, they never get there, but it was about their journey and the racial stereotypes that they even face among themselves, you know, because they have perceptions of each other's culture.  And it's just this journey that they go through.  And I said, "You know what? This is a good film."  It's very thought-provoking, and very deep and heavy.  But I said, "Hey, I want her to get a real film deal, to understand what it's like, which is the sliding scale versus strictly renting our theater, which means, she wouldn't pay any money up front, but we'd share in the proceeds."  And what I learned from that experience--it was very beautiful because that was the one time in our theaters, while she was running that film, where we had, at Chatham, Native Americans coming, Hispanics coming, and African Americans, to see a film.  She did an excellent job, without spending a lot of media dollars, to promote the film, and getting the people out and getting the word out.  And the only restriction that we made with her was--and her name was Henri Norris--is that if the film doesn't generate any money, we can pull it.  That's the only thing.  We can do the split, but if it doesn't you know, when it stops making money, we're going to pull it.  And that film lasted a month, which, you know, in today's standards it could be good.  But they did this strictly grassroots.  And we've done a number, we've done almost everything.  We've done "Asunder," we've done "Uninvited Guests."  We've done them, you know.  We've done Tim and Daphne [Reid] and their projects, you know.  We're like, "Come on." You know, and over the course of this experience, I've learned a lot about the industry I--
Story_ID: 128520
Speaker 1: I now understand why the general industry says, "You know what, y'all just rent."  And a lot of it is because we agree to the sliding scale terms with the studios because they pay the bulk of the marketing.  I mean, they're paying millions of dollars to market these films.  And so, we agree to the terms that they set, and we negotiate the terms and settle on terms with the studios.  The difference with independent black filmmakers, though, is they forget when they're making the film to save money to market the film.  And nine times out of ten, if you're producing an independent film, it's rare when you're going to get picked up by a major studio.  So, knowing that, have a plan in place.  Save some of the money, or get enough money to do some marketing.  And with our market, you don't have to do as much marketing.  I mean, when you're marketing to a small niche community--let's say it's Chicago [Illinois]--you don't have to spend, you don't have to be on every, in every major newspaper.  You don't have to be on every major radio station.  You don't have to be, you know, on TV or radio stations.  There are two primary black radio stations in Chicago.  You know, there are some others.  When you're talking about marketing a movie like--take myself for instance--I listen to W NUA [95.5 FM], and I'll listen to V103.  And you know, there's VON as far as there's certain times you listen to that.  You have my husband [HM Donzell Starks], he listens to [W]GCI[-FM].  And then he may listen to NUA, and then he may listen to that.  So when you look at the numbers behind the stations, you've got two stations that generate you can get 99 percent of the audience almost, with two radio stations.  And depending on the movie, you can slant it.  So, if the movie is more hip-hop or more whatever, if you only got so much money, do [W]GCI.  If it's a more mature audience material, do V-103, and you will have reached them.  Radio is a very efficient means of working it.  But the problem is a lot of these independent filmmakers never planned for that, never had a strategy.  And there are film studios that have built their whole business on marketing more class, artsy-type movies.  And they're strategies about how they've done it.  They haven't just done a mass release of the film.  They've done it market by market, and they built their whole film studio.  It's almost like a U.P.N. (United Paramount Network) scenario with all their views, you know, got their businesses started network started by targeting a specific audience and just building from there.  And, but that's, you know, just another interesting thing about the business.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--What's the most--
Story_ID: 128521
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--What's the most rewarding thing about doing this?
Speaker 1: There are a number of rewarding things, like the jobs that we're able to generate because of the size of these facilities we hire more hundreds of people.  They're not million dollar salary jobs, but they're entry-level jobs.  And what we found in all three communities is there being a need for entry-level jobs.  In fact, the reason the 62nd and Western site is up and it was pushed, it was pushed by a man named Jim Capraro, with a group called Greater Southwest Corporation.  They're like a non-for-profit development corporation.  They've been in housing, commercial development.  And it's a non-for-profit organization, and I wish it was a model for them all over the place to do other things.  But he knew that he had a void in his community, and it was at the entry-level job. They had the Nabisco factory, but Nabisco was saying, "Wait a minute.  When they come here, they're not prepared.  They don't, you know, they need another job before they get to us."  And we provide that.  And with all of the communities, that was the case--there is a need for the entry-level.  In fact, when we opened our theaters, we worked with the City [of Chicago, Illinois].  It created a teenage job readiness program, and that program was phenomenal--to give people just a touch of what the job industry is like.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Story_ID: 128522
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, hopes and concerns for the black community.  I always go back to the fact that I was, I think I was, very idealistic when I was young, and thought I could save the world by myself.  And I know now, well, the African American proverb, you know, "It takes a village to raise a child, to raise a community."  And what I really hope for is that the African American middle class will take it upon themselves to be a part of the struggle.  I think we've lost some things since the Malcolm X timeframes, the [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] timeframes, when we all lived together--we had to live together then.  So there was the doctor on the block, there was the teacher on the block, there was the social worker who lived on the, you know, on the block.  And now, so many of our middle class have fled to the suburbs and have abandoned these communities.  A lot of times, many people don't have role models.  Many of these struggling families don't have role models, other than what they see on TV, of how to act, how to just anything.  And I really almost blame it on us as middle class, you know.  You know, my husband [HM Donzell Starks] and I made a conscious effort to continue living, I'm still living in the community that I basically grew up in, in terms of South Shore [Chicago, Illinois].  It may be where the nicer homes are, but it's there, and I made a conscious effort to live within the black community.  But then that's been my life.  You know, whatever I did, I was coming back.  And we need more of us to take that stance.  Too often I see people who have attained the same economic, or social, or whatever status abandoning our communities and abandoning our--I mean, they really disassociate themselves with our community.  And I think the only way for us to get out of this cycle that we're in--because it seems like it's a cycle that's going like this [pointing downwards], versus sometimes, whereas, the cycle is going up.  And I think it's really going to be the challenge of the black middle class to consciously say I'm going to do this.  And I, I get so angry sometimes.  We go to a number of events, and they can be events that are done by major organizations or museums that are not African American targeted, but they may have their African American or Black History theme day.  And I see names on the donor list, and I see organizations that are owned by corporates companies that are owned by blacks that are giving major sponsorship dollars.  And those same people are not supporting eta [Creative Arts Foundation], are not supporting Muntu [Dance Theater of Chicago].  And my husband I have went out--because we're on boards of various organizations.  And it's like, "Okay, I'm the chairperson of this event, and you've got to give me a big check."  And for an event recently at Muntu Theater, "Live at the Pier," we chaired the event, my husband and I, together, and we went after some of those people.  And some gave.  And one gave in a big way.  And I said this is a major accomplishment because next year I'm going after them, and making them give to others.  But we basically told them, "We can't have it."  You know, it's fine and dandy to support, you know, other organizations, whether it's the Art Institute [of Chicago] or the Museum of Science and Industry, and support them with, you know, I'm talking about tens of thousands of dollars.  It's okay, if that's, you know, I'm hearing you.  And maybe you need to do that politically, whatever.  But then don't come to Muntu with nothing--with five hundred dollars, a thousand dollars.  I don't want, you know.  And that's why I say it's the middle and upper classes that really have to make the difference.  We often, having sat on a number of not-for-profit boards, what we often hear when we go with our new projects--institution building--we hear, "Well, where is the black leadership?  Where is such-and-such?  You know, why aren't they helping, too?"  You know, because that doesn't happen in other, you know, other cultures.  They support each other.  And so, I'm tired of hearing it.  And so I said this is now the time to say, "Hey, I can call you up?  This is what I need."  And, but that's what my big hope is, that one day as the people that need the help can't do it by themselves.  So, my hope is that we understand that we've got to do it.  And it's not simply waiting for some, you know, God, government, whatever, to take care of us.  We've got to do it ourselves.
Story_ID: 128523
Speaker 1: At this junction--and you're really young for a HistoryMaker that we've had around here--what would you consider at this point as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't think we, we don't have our legacy yet.  I think we've made some accomplishments, we've worked hard to get where we are today.  But I think we still have a lot of work to get done.  I think we have done things--what our legacy is at this point, at this juncture, is that we've done things that people thought we couldn't do, that couldn't be done.  And that's the story to tell other people.  If we continue to keep telling these stories, other people will begin to know they can.  That you know, stop saying you can't do things.  You can do things, and it takes work, it takes us talking together.  And that would be the legacy at this point.
Story_ID: 128524
Speaker 1: This is a slightly different, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I don't know how I would describe it, but that we were constantly trying to develop the communities that we come from and live in.  But that is, that is our constant driving factor--is to help develop the communities and to work with people.  That's how I'd like to be remembered.
