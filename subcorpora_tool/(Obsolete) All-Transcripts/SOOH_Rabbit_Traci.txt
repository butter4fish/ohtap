 Little Thunder  Rabbit  My name is Julie Pearson Little-Thunder. Today is Friday, September  13, 2013. I   m interviewing Traci Rabbit in Pryor, Oklahoma, as part of  the Oklahoma Native Artists Project sponsored by Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. As in the  Southwest, we have our own tradition of artist families in Oklahoma,  which includes you and your father, Bill Rabbit, who passed in April,  2012, and while your art and life have been deeply intertwined with your  father   s, you   ve always put your own unique stamp on your work, and  you   re continuing that family legacy. Thank you for taking the time to  talk with me.  You   re welcome.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Claremore, Oklahoma, at the Claremore Indian Hospital.  Grew up at Cherokee Nation housing addition located between Locust  Grove and Pryor.  And you have some siblings, right?  Yes, I have a younger sister. She   s two years younger than I am, Kim  Enyart, and she lives in Colcord  Oklahoma . She   s got two kids, and I  have a younger brother, Billy Rabbit. He   s eight years younger than I  am. He   s got six kids.  What was your relationship with your grandparents on either side?  I also want to say I have one more brother, Stephen Proctor. He   s  actually a cousin, but he lived with us, and he   s a brother. Relationship  with my grandparents I would say was closer on my father   s side  because we lived closer to them and had a very good relationship with  5  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  them. On my mother   s side, it was good. It   s a long, intertwined,  different story, but, yeah, when we did see them, yeah.  Were you the only one of the siblings, children, that was interested in  art?  I think both my sister and brother are talented in their own right. My  sister is a very talented writer. She loves to write poetry, but she   s very  involved   she   s a nurse. My nephew has spina bifida, so her time is  very limited, and her calling is a little bit different. My brother, he  enjoys line drawing, more of a tattoo art style of work, but he   s busy  with six kids. I believe each of us had a talent. As far as I   m concerned,  from a early age I was just always my dad   s shadow. Whatever he was  doing, I wanted to do, too.  What were your opportunities like in Pryor to be around Cherokee  language and culture?  Actually, from a very early age, (my mother could probably tell you the  story better than I could) Cherokee was one of the first languages that I  spoke. When my mom was working, my dad was working another job.  Our babysitter, (that   s what I still call her today at almost forty-four  years old) that   s all they spoke in the home. Of course, my dad   s father  was fluent in Cherokee. As you started school, you lose that, where now,  Cherokee Nation, it   s awesome because they have the immersion  classes. Yeah, I   ve been around Cherokee language all my life and still  know quite a few words. The more you   re around it, as anybody knows,  you start to remember. It   s in the memory banks, for sure.  Right. That   s great that you had that experience. What is your first  experience of seeing Native art?  Oh, wow. I think my first experience in really realizing that that   s what I  was looking at, I would have to say, first grade because I vividly  remember painting a painting which I wish I had. My mom may have it  somewhere. I won a First Place ribbon in first grade. I remember it was a  couple of tipis, a snow scene, had snow and a sun all in the same  painting, (Laughter) but I was aware of it then. Of course, my dad doing  what he did, I was very fortunate to be around a lot, a lot, of well-known  artists and exposed to not only his work but traveling with them. I just  can   t say how blessed I was. I could go on and on about all the different  artists that I   ve known in my life and still know.  What was your first experience of making art?  The very first experience I remember was I was laying in the floor at my  6  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  grandmother   s house. Like I say, we grew up in a housing addition, so  all the aunts and uncles, we all lived in very close proximity. I remember  drawing on the back of a brown paper bag, laying on the floor behind the  door. I vividly remember it was winter, and I had, actually, there   s a  white buffalo. My grandma had a brown one, and I had that buffalo on  the floor, and I   m laying there, sketching that buffalo. I couldn   t tell you  how old I was, but that   s when I really first remember drawing was on  that brown paper sack, yeah.  What kinds of art experiences did you have in primary and secondary  school?  Not a lot when it involved, unfortunately, in the Pryor school system.  Just for a short time I went to Sapulpa, I think a half a year in the first  grade, because my mom was in the hospital for a very long time, so Dad  just moved the family up to Sapulpa. Unfortunately, in the Pryor school  system, we didn   t really have a lot. We had art classes per se, but it was  mostly probably teachers volunteering their time. I hope it   s better  today, but not really a whole, whole lot. I experienced more art, I guess,  in the home.  Even when an artist   s work sells well, you know, artists    children a lot of  times don   t have access to the same material things as their peers. I was  wondering how aware you were, growing up, of the uncertainty of an  artist   s livelihood.  Of my dad   s career? I would say   I graduated high school in 1987, and  Dad starting showing his work at the Art Market, Linda Greever, in  Tulsa, late   80s, kind of started getting his stride really about the year I  graduated. As far as growing up before that, I can   t exactly remember  the date when my mom encouraged him to just jump off the bridge.    It   s  sink or swim time.    I never knew doing without anything, him and my  mother, both, whatever they had to do, whatever they had to sell on the  side. As a child you didn   t know that, but as an adult you hear the  stories, so I never really knew any different. They never let us kids  know. We never did without, and I never felt like I lived in the projects  per se, but as an adult you learn that that is where you lived. Sometimes  kids can be cruel, but it makes your skin a little bit thicker, I guess.  As I graduated college, then I started realizing the reality of the financial  impact of what he did. I had to do a paper, and my degree was in  business administration. That   s a whole other story, why I didn   t take art  at NSU  Northeastern State University . Anyway, I decided to do it on  artists as a profession, and I learned during my research that less than 1  percent of artists in the United States make their full-time living as an  artist. I felt that my dad was a great example of that because my mom  7  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  helped him. She wasn   t working another job while he was doing full-time  art. She helped him matting, framing, traveling, doing everything,  so they were a very cohesive unit, and I learned that that was unusual.  That   s really when I would say the realization of what he did and how  rare it was, that he stood on his own two feet, and that he had a awesome  woman that backed him to do it. I know that they did without a lot so  that we could have.  Did you get involved with, sort of, the business of art? You were already  then in college, I guess. As a teenager you didn   t have much to do with  the family business of art.  Oh, no, no. I started working at the studio when I was twelve. Yes.  Oh, good. Tell me about that.  My dad   s first studio was at the end of a convenience store. He rented  the building, and it wasn   t too far from Cherokee Heights. I remember  vividly I was right at about twelve, about what my niece is now, and my  first job was I had to learn how to stretch canvas. We would be out in  front of the shop on the sidewalk, and he told me, he said,    Sis, now if  you   re going to work here       because he always treated me like an  employee. I guess being the oldest child, I was the experiment because  my sister being the middle child, she seen me get in trouble, so she  would sneak on by. My brother, eight years younger, they were just  tired, (Laughs) and he figured it out real quick  I was the experiment  child.  Anyway, I was on the sidewalk, and I remember this so clear. He said,     You know, if you   re going to work down here       and, like I said, he  treated me so serious.    If you   re going to work down here, you need to  know every aspect of this business. You have to start from ground up,  from cleaning the bathroom, sweeping the floor, and today we   re  stretching canvas.    I remember because it was a big canvas, and he ran  the staple gun. No, he had the pliers, and I did the staple gun. He would  pull down the canvas, and I would do the stapling. Then he had the  hammer, so my job was to staple. So I   ve been involved in that end of  the business. Then I went to shipping and receiving, (Laughter) shipping  of prints. Of course, my mom did the matting and framing at that time.  Yeah, I   ve been involved in that business end for quite a while as an  employer flunky, as Mom says. I was the gopher. (Laughs)  Did you enter some of the youth art competitions, as well?  Yes, the first one that I remember would have been first grade and the  local things that you had at your school. Then I entered student  8  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  competitions at the Five  Civilized  Tribes  Museum , won some awards  there. I think I was out of high school or right out of high school when I  entered the Cherokee Heritage Center in Tahlequah.  Trail of Tears show, are you talking about?  I can   t remember if it was Trail of Tears. I don   t remember, honestly,  which one it was. I just remember I won an award. I was over the top,  and it was probably like Second or Third, but I mean I was just like,     Wow, yeah, that was great     The best thing about that show that I  remember (and I made a copy of the check) was that Wilma Mankiller  was Chief at the time, and she got to go in and, of course, view the  show, and she purchased my painting. I remember making a photocopy  of that check (I have it somewhere) because that was the first big piece  that I sold. Yeah, I was on the top of the world. I thought that was just  the coolest thing because that was like getting a blue ribbon to me,  having her, the first female chief, buying a piece of my art. I thought that  was all right.  Absolutely. You competed for the title of Miss Cherokee in 1988. What  was that experience like?  Well, it was a good experience. It really was. I competed twice, me and  a friend of mine, right out of high school. We both were down at NSU.  The first year I think I got second. I   m not really for sure. The funny  thing is, is for talent I did a painting, and that   s kind of hard to convey  up on the stage, you know. I did a painting that had a story behind it, and  I remember, which I   ll say no names, one of the ladies on the committee,  she said,    That   s just not going to work.    The funny thing is, that   s what  I ended up doing as a career, but it was a great experience. I wanted the  scholarship money. Then I got, I think it was Miss Congeniality or  something. My sister later told me, she said    When they gave you that  award, I was sitting in the audience with Mom and Dad.    She goes,     They don   t know her very well, do they?    (Laughs) Something a sister  would say, it was so funny. It was a great experience, yeah.  So do you feel like, if anything, it played into your art experience in any  way?  The pageant part?  Yes or the competition, that competition aspect, I guess, of public     I think maybe it helped as far as getting out in the public. You know,  that was another thing where my dad pushed me really hard. We would  be driving down the road, and he would be interviewing me in the car  9  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  pretending that   he said,    Okay, Sis,    (and this would happen numerous  times)    I   m going to be the buyer, and I   m going to start asking you  questions.    We would role play going down the highway. As far as  getting up in front of the public and learning how to speak better, of  course, you   re an Okie, and the Okie starts to come out. I would say it  opened horizons for me in the fact that I got to meet a lot of different  people that work for the tribe, and those connections I still have today.  The girl that actually won Miss Cherokee, we   re still friends today. She  went on to be Tribal Council, just a great a person. Yeah, it impacted  me.  You got your degree in business management, as you say, at NSU. Can  you take us through your thinking on that?  I sure can. I started college when I was a senior in high school. I   d  completed all of my courses, and they wouldn   t let me graduate early.  Now they do it all the time. They let me go ahead and start college  courses my senior year, so I was going to RSU  Rogers State  University . By the time I started college, I was just seventeen. I was  actually one of the youngest ones in my class when I graduated high  school, and I had decided to go to NSU. It was close to home, and I was  still traveling with Mom and Dad. They would fly me to, like, Santa Fe  Indian Market, so I wanted to be close to home. I go down there. I  enroll, 4.0 student from high school. First semester, they   re coming at  you. They want to know what your major is, so they   re assigning you a     it   s not a counselor but the person that signs your     Advisor?  Advisor. They assign me an advisor. Not knowing what I want to do, I  said,    Well, I want to open an art gallery or something like that, I guess.  Just put something down.    I was assigned the advisor, the head of the art  department down there at the time. I have to go and meet him, and he  says,    So what do you want to do with the rest of your life,    so on and so  forth. I told him, I said,    Well, open an art gallery, work for my tribe.  I   m really undecided. This is my first semester. Or I may be an artist one  day. I have no idea.    You know, just full of hope and dreams at that age.  He said    An artist? What do you mean, an artist?    I said    Well, I like to  paint, and I have sold a few pieces. Maybe I   ll paint one day,    you  know, real na  ve. He says    Well, that will never happen.     He didn   t know about your father.  Well, that   s the rest of the story. He didn   t realize how unafraid I was to  stand up for myself, and I told him,    What do you mean it will never  happen?    The conversation went downhill real fast. Even though I was  10  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  seventeen, when it comes to certain subject matter or my dad   s career, I  can be very boisterous and know my facts on that. I said,    I can name  you five artists right now that make their living off their art.    He said     Well, who are they?    Boy, I named off bam, bam, bam, of course, my  dad being the first one. He said    I   ve never heard of Bill Rabbit,    and I  said,    Well, I   m surprised.     Of course, I changed my major, literally, that day. I walked over to the  book store and got the book of degrees, and I flipped through there. I  thought,    Okay,    I   m reading the different degrees,    I   m not a teacher.  I   m not this. I   m not this. I really don   t like science all that much.     Business administration, computers, so I kind of start reading through  there. Tax accounting.    Okay, I can do this. That would help out down at  the shop, help my mom out.    I mean, literally, this was all in one day.  Bought that book, set out my plan, and every semester it   ll have laid out  what classes you should take.  I was my own advisor for the five years. I never darkened that man   s  doorway again. That   s how I ended up doing business administration, all  in one day. Come home that evening. I   m telling my mom and dad. He  said    What was that guy   s name?    I told him the name. He said    That   s  funny. I just met him a month ago. He hung my thirty-year retrospective  show at the museum.    I said,    He told me he didn   t even know who you  was.    Anyway, that   s how I decided what degree to get in college.  That   s an amazing story.  I had a plethora of artists that Dad was friends with, and so I had all  these teachers that when I asked them a question, I felt privileged  because they would share their information with me freely.  Can you name maybe one or two artists that you particularly admired or  that you could talk to in that way?  Oh, yeah. Ted Miller, Charles Pratt, at that time probably Ben Harjo,  Ben Shoemaker, Bob Annesley. There were so many. I mean, you just  think of that group that was at the Art Market, all of them, Troy  Anderson, even to this day. Donald has been awesome since I lost my  dad.  Donald Vann.  Yeah. He   s invited me down to his studio to sit with him and to learn.  We had talked about doing, actually, some neat educational interviews  with him while he   s here. I wish I had done more of that with my dad.  So, yeah, I can name a lot. A lot.  11  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Was one of your first gallery shows at the Art Market with your dad, one  of the first shows you did in a gallery?  No, actually one that I recall in a gallery setting probably would have  been Doris Littrell   s gallery. Mom and Dad were off at a show. I was  just newly married, and I went to Oklahoma City. I think I had maybe  four pieces, and they were more of a woodland style of work. I  remember being there by myself, (which me and Dad seemed like a  team) but that would have been the very first one that I vividly  remember.  So, she was having a group show, and you brought in four pieces?  Yeah, she was having a group show. She asked me to be in it. Dad  couldn   t be there. I think he may have had some pieces there, (I don   t  remember) but they were out of state. That was probably the first that I  can recall right now. After that, when I was in college, Dad, he said,    I  want you to graduate. That is your priority right now.    While I was in  there, probably about my third year, I actually thought about working for  the Bureau of Indian Affairs because I   ve always enjoyed keeping up  with tribal politics and different things like that. I continued to paint, and  he would take my work with him. After I graduated college, that was an  accomplishment for my dad and my mom because I was the first one in  my family to graduate college. He was very proud of me. He said    That  little piece of paper, Sis, nobody can ever take away from you.    As a  matter of fact, I got it framed, and it   s over there on the wall. I keep it  down here.  That is cool. What did you do, then, after graduation?  After graduation, that was about the time   honestly, everything works  out for a reason. You come to a crossroads in your life. I had actually  looked at several jobs through Cherokee Nation, actually through my  connections to the Miss Cherokee pageant, talking to friends. It was  about that time (this is 1993) that the IRS got ahold of my dad for about  five years    worth of audits. It was meant to be to have my business  degree. I stepped in immediately, helped my mom and dad line  everything out. They had an accountant. He left the state, but it was a  good learning experience. That was my jumping-off point, where you  come to a crossroads, do this or this. I felt like this is what I was  supposed to do.  I finished college, and then I was supposed to come back, and it all  happened. It was quite the experience that has affected me. That  experience has affected me through my life, very much so. That   s when  12  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  I started taking over the paperwork, the business end, the accounting of  it. The very last year they were audited, (which at the time I didn   t know  you should take an attorney with you) me and Dad went by ourselves,  took all of our records, and the audit was over in about thirty minutes.  The lady says,    Why are you even here?    I had everything in line for  them, every receipt.  Learned a lot. A lot of artists to this day, I   m surprised   we get hit up  for donations for good causes all the time. Organizations will tell you  you can write that off. Artists cannot. You can only write off the cost of  that canvas. The IRS does not care about your talent or what it would  sell in the real market. It was a good learning experience. That   s when, I  guess, my career as a accountant, part-time manager under my mom, and  then still painted on the side.  It   s a great combination to have. What were some of the drawbacks of  having a father who was a well-known artist?  There   s not many, but the one I will say is   I would say there   s only  probably one. You inherit not only the friends but you inherit the  enemies, even though you had nothing to do with the situation. I would  say that   s it.  What were the benefits?  Oh, gosh, those are numerous. Getting to experience art on a different  level than just the average child. Travel. Having a really cool art  collection. My mom and dad were   not only did we get a piece of his  art for birthdays and Christmas, they started our collection. I would say  we started getting Doc Tate Nevaquaya originals probably about in  junior high. Every year they made a concerted effort, and it depended on  who we liked. Doc Tate was always one of my favorites, and Kelly  Haney. Every year we would get another artist   s piece of work. Getting  to travel, seeing     For a present at Christmas?  For a Christmas present, yeah. I have a pretty extensive art collection,  and not only enjoying that piece of art but also actually knowing that  artist on a personal level. A lot of kids, they   re not afforded that  opportunity. Getting to see different things, not only after a show   s set  up but all the work that goes in behind it, behind the scenes, because it   s  a lot of work. Gosh, having a private teacher. You can take all the art  classes that you want, and you learn their technique and their style. My  dad, being self-taught, he would just jump in there and do it because  nobody ever told him that he couldn   t. That was the kind of teacher that  13  Little Thunder  Rabbit  I had. We would be down here at this studio. There were many a days,  being on the big easel behind you there, just having fun and  experimenting, yeah, and the benefit of just having exceptional parents.  Did your father   s collectors gravitate toward your work, as well, or did  you develop a separate following, or was it kind of a combination?  I would say in the beginning, maybe a little bit of a combination, but not  all collectors are going to follow what you do. They   ll encourage you.  There was one gentleman   I had done quite a bit of work for my first  show at Indian Market with my dad, and I was probably twenty, twenty-one,  maybe. Like I said, Dad used to tell me,    You better develop thick  skin fast. I can open doors for you, but I can   t coddle you. I   m not going  to tell gallery owners and/or collectors. You will have to stand on your  own two feet, period.     I would say the person that I admired right out of high school, their  work, was Dana Tiger. I remember being at Colorado Indian Market and  looking down from the mezzanine at her booth, thinking,    She   s  awesome.    I think that   s what really inspired me to start painting Native  American women. Well, I know it is. She was really, really the person.  Being friends with her now, (and I   ve told her this story) I said,    I can  tell you what you were wearing, even, that day, and I just thought you  rocked.     As far as collectors, I had one collector come up, and this was, I would  say, my first series of Native American women that I was trying to  portray and trying to find my footing. I think as a child of somebody that  is well-known, you   re painting what you   re being taught, but yet you  want to go in the total opposite direction so people can differentiate your  work from your father   s. The in-the-shadow syndrome. A collector came  up and said,    I just don   t think those women are ever going to sell for  you.    I remember at first thinking,    Wow, that   s kind of mean,     (Laughs) but then it was probably the best thing that he ever told me  because I made it a point from that show on that I was going to paint  women   s faces, not just the back of their heads. Some of my early work,  it would just be the back of their heads. Dad would draw all these  profiles for me on a canvas, and he   d say    Okay, Sis, I want you to start  painting all these profiles,    because that   s what he mostly did. He was  teaching me what he knew. From that Indian Market on, I thought,    I am  going to do anything but profiles.     I started just practicing and practicing and practicing, and trying to get  the color right and different things. It grew to where I had some people  that collected my work because I was Bill   s daughter, and then as my  style grew and the more time you spend and you get better at your art, I  14  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  started to have a collector base that didn   t even collect Dad   s. It   s funny  how things come full circle. You start standing on your own feet and  doing a totally different style, but yet the hair was always what tied his  work and my work together. I would say Dad was really well known for  that long hair, and so I use that in my work.  Now I have my own collector base, before he passed, to where they  would walk into a show, and people would say    Well, you know,  Bill,    (they would apologize to him)    I just really like your daughter   s  work.    He goes,    She is a good buy. I am more proud of her. You should  collect her work because it   s better than mine. She can paint faces way  better.    That   s a dad talking. Yeah, it   s a combination. It   s a  combination. Then towards the end, we did the collaboration work  together.  Yeah, and we   ll talk about that here pretty quick. So when did you  establish Rabbit Studios here?  In this building, I want to say, I think we   ve been here since 1990, I  believe. Prior to that, Dad had a couple of other smaller studios.  Also open to the public, like a store kind of situation?  They were smaller. The public has always been able to come down, but I  would say this is a bigger location where we were able to do that.  And whose idea was it? Was it kind of everybody   s or your dad   s or  yours?  I was in college at the time, so I would say that was a Mom and Dad. He  outgrew the studio by Kentucky Fried Chicken, pretty much, and they  were looking for a building. This used to be a car shop. A guy kept his  racecar here. It came up for sale, and it was what they needed, so we   ve  been here since.  The Native Art market got pretty tough after 2001, and a lot of artists  tried to figure how to ride it out, or are still trying to figure that out. I  know that one of your strategies was reproductions of artwork on  smaller, less expensive items. How have those been important to your  business?  Very important. Right after I graduated college, Dad was already doing  calendars with a company in Phoenix, Arizona, which was not always a  popular path to follow. When you   ve got three kids and one in college     which my mom and dad paid for every ounce of my college out of their  pocket. That   s something I   m very proud I can say. From the selling of  15  his art, he paid for my five years. When I got out, he was already dealing  with a company in Phoenix, Arizona. I   m not for sure really what it was  that sparked doing the gift items.  Like I said, I was doing my art then, as well. I believe one of the last  calendars, it was six of Dad   s images, six of mine. My dad was a very  smart businessman. He just had that innate ability to see both worlds, so  when I came along, got done with college, I could see a lot of  opportunities in his work. It was kind of the next generation moving  forward, doing something more innovative and out of the box, which he  had already done in his time by stepping outside of the boundaries of  Oklahoma and expanding his market.  An opportunity came along to work with a company and do contracts  where they   re producing your work, and you get paid a royalty. One of  the contracts kind of went sour. Dad would do business on your word.  You can write up the longest contract that you want, but if that person is  not going to back it, that contract doesn   t mean anything. Learned that  real early. I don   t care if you have an attorney or not. Anyway, there was  this deal that went sour, and I told Dad, I said,    We can do that. We can  do that.    It was from that bad experience that evolved us starting to be  our own manufacturer.  I told Dad, I said,    Even though it   s not the norm at the time, why can   t  we do it? All we   ve got to do is go buy some equipment.    We set a goal.  We started off small. At that time everybody was doing limited edition  offset lithographs. I said,    Why don   t we take these calendar prints, and  let   s put a mat on them. They   re printed on the same paper as a limited  edition, the same thickness. The same printer printed them. Let   s put a  mat on them. Let   s appeal to a market of about fifteen dollars retail,     because most people at that time, and even today, will drop a twenty and  not think too much about it. You get over a hundred, and they   re  considering it.  So that   s how that started. We went from these calendars that everybody  was buying to putting a mat on them, selling them, to doing notecards,  doing our own magnets, and it just kind of grew. I think that   s where the  marketing or business end that I enjoy so much, that   s probably where it  started. I probably got that from my mom and dad, that can-do attitude.     If this company can do it, so can we.    That   s how that started. When  we started doing the tiles, we were one of the first artists that were  actually producing our own tiles because at that time R. C. Gorman     when dad was named one of the top five investments in the United  States, it was him, Amado Pe  a, I think, Doc Tate, Donald Vann, and  there   s one more that   s evading my memory. Everybody was doing  licensing agreements at the time, but nobody was actually producing.  16  Little Thunder  Rabbit  We had the family backing with my mom and cousins that we had this  support system. My brain that sometimes, my mom says, goes twenty-four  hours a day, I was like,    We can do this.    I   ll tell you what, I   d go  see a product, and I   m like,    We can do our image and do this. We   re  already doing the wholesale shows with these manufacturers. Why not  do our own line?    Dad says,    Go for it,    and I did. I ran with it, but I  always had supportive parents and, of course, his images. It has just  grown exponentially. During the bad times of the economy when people  aren   t necessarily buying a  3,000,  4,000,  5,000 original, they will  buy a twenty-dollar matted notecard. That filled in the gap, but it also  created a whole new area of collectors that would buy these matted  things.  As you explained, those kinds of small sales are important and they add  up for an artist, but I know that you   ve run into some problems with  shows over that.  Some of the shows are, they are original-only shows, which I respect. I  respect the rules. The rules have been around a long, long time, but from  a next generation   s point of view, and I look at   my dad would always  tell me if you see somebody that   s successful, whether they   re an artist  or no matter what form of business they   re in, try to figure out why  they   re successful. You look at McDonalds, Wal-Mart, how Wal-Mart  prices things. All of these things would come into play for how we  would do things.  I think my dad being a full-time artist, when you support your family  and your mom, nobody else is working a nine-to-five and bringing home  a check or retirement, disability, whatever, and all you have to rely on is  the sale of your art. You go to a show, and you can only show originals,  and you   re sitting there for two days, three days, whatever it may be,  you   re hoping for that one collector. In the back of your mind you   re  thinking,    Okay, when I get home I have a house payment. I   ve got this.  I   ve got two other kids still in school.    That part, when you   re doing it  full-time, it never leaves your brain, never.  When you   re picking these shows, having all originals, it   s great. You  have to have those originals in order to have the reproductions. Yes, it  does all start there, but you still have to pay the electric bill. I think  sometimes promoters of shows, it has gone on so long is has become a  tradition. I feel personally that Native Americans, our art is as good as  anybody   s in the world, anybody   s, but I think sometimes that the rules  are antiquated and that Native Americans, we are smart, innovative  people. They tried to kill us out, but it didn   t happen. We   ve got strong  DNA. So why can   t we compete on a world market just like European  17  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  artists?  That has always been my mindset. When you go to a show and you rent  your ten-by-ten, my philosophy or my argument, I guess, was if we   re  making these products, especially the reproductions, we   re cutting the  mats, we   re printing our own prints, we   re making our own tiles. You  can come down to my studio any time and see the equipment that I use.  You have questions, I   ll answer them. If you   re supporting your family,  cousins, and a lot of times uncles, aunts, over the years, everybody is  pulling together to produce these products, why can we not sell those?  Those rules at shows   I   ve written many letters to Red Earth and  different ones, stating my point of my argument because for them that is  a one-time show that they have volunteers, and they do a great job  behind the scenes. It takes a lot of work to put on a show, and then you  have cantankerous artists that come in and want to complain. I don   t  want to be that artist, but I also know that on the economic side, that you  have bills to pay and that for those three days, you are there to sell, to  conduct business, to be professional. I   ve got three days to make a  month   s worth of money to come home and pay bills. I think committees  and people like that, they don   t take that into consideration. I volunteer. I  said,    I will come and talk to you guys and maybe you can see things, or  why don   t you come to my studio? Because if I don   t sell something  here this weekend and at least pay for my booth and expenses, I   m going  in the hole. I   ve still got the electric when I get home.     It has always been, in my opinion,    Don   t put your thumb on us.  Encourage us. Let us compete on a world market because we are  intelligent, innovative people, and we have the gusto and the know-how.     Especially the younger generation that   s coming up. They   re  computer literate, and they are doing wonderful things with technology.  They don   t necessarily have to be a hand-pulled item or a hand-pulled  print. I think that we need to adjust with the times. There   s only going to  be one original, only going to be one, but let us compete on a world  market with everybody else because we   re just as smart and as good as  they are. That   s just been my opinion.  Let   s talk a little bit about when you and your dad began painting  collaboratively     Okay.     how that idea came about and what your first project was.  Okay, first project. The first project, I would have to say it was a five-piece  mural that we did. They were building the new Cherokee Casino in  18  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Catoosa, and at that time Taylor Keen was the one in charge of  commissioning work for the restaurant, is what it was. He called me and  Dad up there. Put on our hard hats. We got to go up there and see what  they were talking about, where it was going to be displayed, the subject  matter that they wanted. It was five thirty-by-forty canvases that made  one big original. We told them our idea. He said,    Go with it. Love it.     The big easel behind you, we actually extended the two-by-fours to hold  all five pieces. That was the very first one that we worked together. First  of all, it was a very strict deadline, and we needed both of us on it to  complete the deadline.  So that   s kind of how the idea of collaborating came about?  Yes. I believe that Taylor had asked,    Could you two work on this  together? That way we have       because they were trying to incorporate  all the Cherokee artists. At that time there was only so many spots of art  that could be filled. It was kind of a twofer, a two-for-one, and that was  our first one. After we completed that, it was   I   ve always enjoyed  working with my dad, but it was such an honor to even be asked. It was  pretty humbling. I was nervous. I was all of those things that, yeah. That  was the first one, that five-piece mural.  And it was what subject matter?  It was titled Spring Planting, and it was a Cherokee homeplace after the  Removal when they came to Oklahoma. It depicted something very  similar to my dad   s grandparents    home, kind of rural Cherokee country.  How did you divide up the painting responsibilities?  We divided it up into what we do best.  Which was?  Dad would, he did   okay, I   m trying to think of the piece. I have it up  front, a small tile mural gift item. Even on any collaboration piece that  we did after that, we did what we did best. Dad would do backgrounds at  that time. I   m a detail-oriented person, so there   d be trees with all the  limbs and things that he did back in the day. I started to pick up on that.  He would work on it a little bit. There was so much detail in that  painting. I didn   t want to paint a tree for years after that because I think  we had, was it four, four big trees. I mean the tree is this high, and you  know the detail I   m talking about, with your husband.  So he was kind of roughing in the background, the landscape?  19  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Yeah, he would do the background, the mountains, pad that in how he  would do with his sponges and different things, and then he would take a  break. While he was done with his session, he   s over here on the other  easel painting other paintings, getting ready for other shows. Then I  would come in, and I would do a layer of my work. Then he would come  in. It was kind of an alternating thing. There was a big scissortail, flying  bird in the sky. I would do the detail of that. There was parts of it that we  both worked on, and then there were things that were just totally  separate. It truly is a collaborative effort when we work together, very  much so.  That   s cool. In 2006 you and your dad competed nationally, I think, to  come up with a concept for the Trail of Painted Ponies.  Yes.  I think your dad had already done one, but this was one you did  together. Can you talk about that a little bit?  Yeah, when that came about it was called the Native American Art of  Horse Painting, I believe was the theme of the competition. He had  already done one pony titled Earth, Wind, and Fire. It was a full-sized  horse. They had asked us to submit a sketch. We were down here  talking. Usually we would have our morning meetings at breakfast at  Thomas   , and I told him, I said     At Thomas   ?  Restaurant.  Okay.  Yeah, we would have breakfast over there.  That   s your routine?  That was our routine. We   d eat breakfast every morning over there, talk  about what we was going to accomplish for the day, what we needed to  do. We had a list by the time we got here to the studio to accomplish that  day. It was getting down to the deadline for the sketch. I don   t know if a  lot of artists are like that, but I   m usually, like, right down to the  deadline. Maybe it   s an Indian thing. I don   t know. (Laughs) We were  having breakfast one morning, and the deadline was approaching. They  gave us this outline of the horse. I said    You know what, Dad? They   re  only going to pick ten, and we need to be different. Instead of you doing  a pony and me doing a pony, because these sketches are flat, let   s put  20  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  your design on one, my design on the other, and tell them it   s going to  be one pony where you paint one side, I paint the other.    He   s like     Man, that is great, Sis      We get back to the studio, and I said    Okay, the horse culture is mostly  your Plains tribes, so let   s go that direction. On your side, what do you  think? You paint the male warrior, or his version, what he   s responsible  for within that tribe. I   ll do the female version on my side.    We still  have the original sketches. When we sent that in, we were hopeful. We  wanted it to be different, and we was approaching it as a collaborative  effort. There was over 400 entries, international, when they called. They  picked him, and we was one of the ten. I was so nervous. You know  when you   re doing a sketch and you   re jumping out there, you   re like,     Woo-hoo, yeah, let   s do it     Then when you get chosen, you   re like,     Oh, yeah, now that   s pressure.    That was so cool   They sent us the horse. At that time they were doing what they called  maquette, so they were smaller horse, not a life-size. Dad actually  finished his side first. When we do collaborative, I would let him go  first, and then it was my turn to do my side. I actually worked on my  horse quite a bit while he was in the hospital. I would just bring my little  paint table and worked right beside his bed in the room.  So that got finished very recently?  His hospital stays   he had battled Agent Orange. He was first diagnosed  thirty, thirty-one. A lot of people didn   t know it was Agent Orange. He  battled it for thirty-five years. When we was doing the pony, he was not  in kidney failure at that time, but he would battle respiratory problems.  He   s real prone to pneumonia, so it was one of those days. We got to  where we called them slumber parties because when he went in the  hospital, I didn   t come home until he did.  You were in a traveling exhibit, I think, sponsored by the  National   Museum of the American Indian at the Smithsonian called Ramp it Up. I  may not have that right. It was skateboard art, and it sounded like a lot  of fun. I wondered if you could talk about that.  Yes, I was doing a show at the Smithsonian, and I met this skateboard  company, Native Skates. He was actually across from us, from our  booth. You know how you are when you   re at shows. You get to know  your neighbors, and you get to meet some great people. I had one of  Dad   s feathers hanging. I was trying to think if Dad was there that year.  Anyway, he said    You know, that would look really great on a  skateboard. You open to that idea?    I said,    I   m always open to neat, fun  ideas.    So that   s how that came about. We was actually neighbors at a  21  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  show. I think the skateboard idea was awesome. It was so neat to be  represented. They photographed that, and Todd sent that to me through  an e-mail.  You didn   t go to an opening.  We weren   t able to go at that time. It was really cool. As a matter of fact,  we had a snowboard company like my dad   s skeleton paintings and had  talked about doing that on snowboards. It   s really cool to   and that   s  what was neat about my dad is that he was multi-generational. He was  always in touch with his age group, being a baby boomer, older people,  all the way to the young kids on skateboards. When I told him, I said,     What do you think about a skateboard?    he goes,    That   s cool     He  thought it was great, yeah.  I don   t remember if you mentioned the name of that show that you met  Todd at.  It was the Smithsonian Powwow.  The Smithsonian Powwow.  Yes.  Okay, I   d like to talk a little bit about your process and techniques a  little bit more.  Okay.  So how has your subject matter changed since you started painting?  I think when I started painting, I did the Woodland style of, basically,  my dad   s work because he was teaching me what he knew. From that,  evolved into more following Dana   s work like I mentioned earlier  because I just thought she was awesome. I started painting the Native  American woman. Then over the years, that really has been the mainstay  unless it   s a commission or something that we   re working for Cherokee  Nation. That, then and now, continues to probably be my passion  because I had such a strong mother figure in my life that told me I could  do anything that I set my mind to. I guess that   s why I always admired  Dana at the time because she seemed to personify that type of a person. I  continue to paint Native American women. That   s what I enjoy.  How has your palette or choice of colors changed over the years?  I would say in the beginning it was more earth tones, doing the  22  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  landscapes and the Cherokee old home place settings. If I   m feeling red  and purple that day, we   re going to do red and purple. Being around a  colorful character like my dad and, like I say, being self-taught, if he  was feeling green, purple that day   he loved color. He just loved color.  That has obviously been a big influence on me. I know, personally,  when I walk into my home and I see my art on the wall, color makes me  feel good. If I   m able to create something that day and I   m feeling the  red, hopefully somebody is going to walk into my booth and they   re  feeling the red, and they like it, and it puts a smile on their face. Right  now, I   m starting to paint again, which has been a process. For Santa Fe  Indian Market, that was a big stepping stone for me because I applied for  a booth on my own, and I was accepted.  That   s unusual for first-time applications.  Yeah. I felt my dad behind me all the way. Color makes me feel good.  Right now I   m    the brighter the better,    as Dad would say. (Laughter)  Your primary medium is acrylic on canvas.  Yes, yes, I enjoy the acrylics. I did take a oil class with Sharon Irla. She  was kind of laughing at me because   which I love her work, great artist.  She does oil. We sat down, and we had to sketch. I think you can  continue to learn. When you quit learning, you   re done. I   ve heard a lot  of artists say,    What is the best painting you   ve completed?    Well,  you   re always looking for that next one that you   re going to do. I took  her class. I thought,    I   m going to try oil, okay.    Dad said,    I think  that   d be a good idea.    I go down there, got my sketch done, and we   re  doing what she calls the gray stage of the old Masters.  I went and bought the book that she recommended. I   m honestly not a  big reader. I   m a picture person. When I was in college (honestly I hate  to say this on tape) I never read a book openly. I   m a scanner. I   m a  note-taker, so I   m a quick thinker. I   m a study, visual. I had my sketch  out, and we   re doing this gray stage, and everybody   s mixing their paint.  With oil, you   re afforded the ability to take your time and blend. Well, I  grew up in acrylics, and I   m used to,    Let   s get the paint on there.    You  have your hairdryer right here, and you   re drying it, and we   re moving  on the to the next stage.  This four-hour class, Traci had done in about thirty minutes. Sharon  come over there, and she   s kind of laughing at me. I said,    What do we  do now?    She goes,    Traci, that has to dry.    (Laughter) I said,    I got  three more hours. What do I do?    So I didn   t take all of her classes. She  gave me the Cliff Notes. To this day, actually, I apply a couple of the  techniques that I learned in the oil class, but I do them with acrylic. I just  23  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  figured out how to do it with acrylic because my brain and how I was  taught or trained or mentored is to work fast.  I   m wondering about some of your stylistic shifts. I think one exploration  that I thought was really interesting (and it happened on the pony) was  some ledger images but very stylized. You could tell they were your  ledger images. Are you doing a bit of that, too, or was that just for that  particular project?  No, I   ve done several. I   ve always been fascinated by Plains Indian art,  always. My interest or influence in things that I like ranges. It   s kind of a  strange combination. I love Japanese art. Karl Bang, love his work, and I  like Plains artists. I love ledger drawing. I guess that   s the reason I like  Doc Tate   s work because it was so detailed. So, no, I still continue to do  the ledger work. As a matter of fact, I did a line, I guess you could say,  or a time in my career where I did nothing but hand-painted purses and  big leather wall hangings a lot of people have never seen because I   ve  been really blessed, when I was traveling with my dad, to sell.  So they were selling out of state?  Oh, yeah. Traveling with my dad, he threw me into an arena of full-time  artists very young and very fast. I feel that when you   re creating a piece  for a competition, you need to have the time to sit down, to put your best  foot forward. For me, personally, keeping up with my dad   s pace from a  early age and traveling and doing as many shows as we had to to pay the  wonderful IRS back for those ten long years, I did not have time to sit in  a studio and to create pieces for competition. I forgot your question. I  got to rambling.  No, it was just about the ledger art.  The ledger art, right. I guess in my art I   ve always been a detail person,  so that   s what fascinated me about that. I would look at books and  different things with the ledger artwork on it and kind of put a little  contemporary spin on it, I don   t know, just putting a, maybe, female  touch, showing the male side. I   ve always enjoyed Plains art. I really  have, really, really have. Fascinated by it and the parfleche designs.  Love those. As a matter of fact, on my motorcycle out back, there   s a big  ledger piece on the leather bag with the beadwork that you   ll have to  see. Yeah, that   s what I chose to put on my motorcycle was ledger art.  (Laughs)  And you also have a line, I think, of Cherokee clan images.  Yes.  24  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Were those all your work, or a combination of yours and your dad   s, or  all your dad   s?  Let   s see. There   s seven clans that we   ve done. Then we   ve also done a  series of Southeast designs, which your Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw,  we all kind of claim those Pre-Columbian designs. The seven clans, the  ones that we do for our gift line of coffee mugs and different things that  we sell to the museums, I think that first seven clan series, those were  Dad   s only. He was commissioned, actually, by the Boys and Girls Club  here locally. Those seven originals hang in their fun game room here in  Pryor. Those seven clans are my dad   s. It   s funny how, like I said  earlier, when you do it full-time and you   re thinking of how to pay the  bills, it   s a bonus. As an artist, I think, you   re going to create anyway,  and it   s a bonus getting paid. You find that fine line in between where  you   re getting paid and you still get to do what you love. That   s where  you branch off into different marketing ideas.  The Southeast designs kind of became popular when the Hard Rock     each of our casinos is themed a certain time period. Our Tribal Council,  which was awesome, any building that is built within the Cherokee  Nation, the 1 percent fund goes for the purchase of art. Hard Rock is the  Pre-Columbian era, so those really became popular. A resurgence of  those, not only in pottery, the gorget shell jewelry, that Southeast culture  really started people to recognize that. That was a whole other series that  we did together, yes.  What role does sketching play in your work?  A little. Where my dad did, maybe on a canvas, very little sketching, he  may draw the profile in. Me, my process of creating is different than his,  because he (and this is my opinion) was like five artists in one body. I  used to love to watch him paint because he would go directly from the  wet paint here, right onto the canvas. Me, my process is, I   m a little,  well, not a little. My mom says I   m a whole lot more detailed-oriented.  That   s what I always admired about Ben Harjo, Merlin Little Thunder   s  work, is all that detail that they would put in these pieces.  I sit down, and depending on what show, what area of the country I   m  going to, I think that that   s always been important. I   ll sit down, and  usually it takes me   and my dad never could understand this, but it   d  take me about two days to unwind. I would explain to him where he  would get to come down to the studio, all he had to do was paint. Me,  I   m paying bills, taxes, I   m marketing, I   m getting ads ready, I   m paying  booth fees. Your left and right brain, you have to calm that one side  down to go to your creative side. It took me about a day, day and a half  25  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  to come down.  When I   m in that zone of creating, then that   s when I do a little, not a  whole lot, of detailed sketch. I just kind of know where I want to put her,  and then after that I   ll   right now, actually, I feel like I   ve come full  circle where I can pick up on a technique that my dad called his sky  image, more of a drippy technique to where there is no sketching  involved in that. You   re literally working it wet. How it dries, it   s a fun  surprise when it   s all done. So, yeah, very little, probably the face, just  the outline. Actually, I have a sketch behind you that I could show you.  That would be how it would start.  What kinds of research do you do?  Depends on the piece. If it   s a commission piece, a lot of research. The  piece behind me, that was an era of 1780 to 1830, which is right prior to  the removal of the Cherokee people. For this piece, library. You have  your online access, which is great. It depends on the piece, depends on  the piece, really. If I   m incorporating, say, a different tribe, I try not to  do anything that would even   I don   t even remotely touch their  religious beliefs or something like that. I try to respect all of that because  I am not knowledgeable in that. If I had a specific question, I do have  friends like Charles Pratt, Cheyenne-Arapaho. I have asked him  questions, you know. That   s where having that access to very well-known  artists has been very valuable to me growing up, very valuable.  Can you describe your creative process from the time you get an idea?  If I   m in the zone and I   m not having to be at my desk, I   ll start there.  When I was getting ready for Indian Market, I knew I   m going out to the  Southwest. I knew what style of work my dad did and sold well out  there. Being my first Indian Market, I knew that I wanted to have my  women, his technique, my colors, my detail. That creative process for  this show was probably one of the most important shows of building  inventory that I   ve done to date, and I feel like it was received well. I  sold well, being one of, what, a thousand artists out there. I was  extremely blessed. Paid for my trip, met some great people, came back  full of energy. When I come home, I just want to get right back to the  easel, but yet it is a business, and I have to treat it as such. You have to  continue to do the paperwork side of it. As a matter of fact, I   m doing  taxes all this week. (Laughter)  You sort of described your routine a bit, your creative routine, breakfast  in the morning. Is there anything else that kind of grounds you each  day?  26  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Each day.  Working at night as opposed to     I would feel my routine has changed a lot since the passing of my dad,  which is sometimes hard. When I   m getting ready for a show, the best  time for me to work   now at our studio we do Monday through  Thursday. Fridays is Traci day down here by herself to where she   s  quiet. I have to have quiet. I prefer the radio music going. I don   t  necessarily like the TV. When I   m getting ready for a show, when I was  getting ready for Indian Market, I knew what I had to do. I was up at  five, and I worked until eleven each night every day to get ready for that  show. It was right about three and a half weeks, and it was crunch time.  Right now I   m two individuals. I have to keep a business running, and  we do wholesale markets, and we have galleries that call, stores that call  that are placing orders, thank goodness. God has blessed our family  beyond measure, so that takes up a lot of my time.  When the next year comes, we   re already planning, right now, new gift  items. As a matter of fact, this week I got here at, it was about five thirty  in the morning. By the time my mom and my cousin get here at nine, I  had this whole list. I said,    I am wired for sound  I   ve been up since five  thirty.    I think that probably my mom would say since maybe March or  April of this year, you start to feel a little bit, getting back into the  groove. It   s been a process.  Well, thinking back on your career, what was a pivotal moment when  you might have gone down one road but you took another? You might  have touched on it already.  I would say the pivotal moment really would have been the IRS because  my family needed me. A lot of things that they were experiencing at the  time was things that (and I don   t want to say his name) if Mr. Art  Instructor down there, head of the art department, had not discouraged  me   . Everything happens for a reason. You think that you   re going  along in your life, and you have this great plan laid out ahead of you,  and somebody hits you from the side. You just change your trajectory of  your life, and it was not by accident. I feel that that was probably pivotal  for me. Probably the second would be not having  Dad  here.  If you like, we   ll pause and take a look at some of your paintings.  Okay.  You want to tell us about this piece, the title, etcetera?  27  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  This piece right here is titled Warrior Within. It   s a new original that I  just completed. As I had stated earlier, the creative process, on a blank  canvas I would sketch her face in. Then I would take the acrylic, (golden  fluid acrylic is actually what I prefer to use) I would paint in the  background. Then this technique that you see here, this is all done very  fast, very wet with a brush. Once I have on there a general idea of what I  like, I actually would tilt the canvas in the direction that I want the paint  to flow. It never dries how it is when you first put it on, so it   s a fun  deal. It   s like you   re getting a present at the end.  You like that element of surprise.  Yes.  And your signature, you want to explain what you do for your signature  real quick?  Yes, how I sign my originals. My dad would sign his    Rabbit    with the  cross above his name with the radiating beams. When I first started  painting, I always signed my name, Traci Rabbit. Then over the years, I  have incorporated his cross, as well, so that   s how you differentiate our  paintings.  How about this piece?  This one   s titled Sarah   s Tea Party. This actually represents a Cherokee  home place in Oklahoma, a little girl. This is what I would call a  Woodland style piece of work with all the detail in the trees, the fine  detail of her dress, the patchwork quilt. When I was working on this  piece   actually, this one has not shown a lot. I decided to put the little  stuffed rabbit in the chair she was having the tea party with.  I love that.  When my mom seen the rabbit, she confiscated it, so a lot of people  haven   t seen this particular piece. This one   s titled Sarah   s Tea Party.  And how about this particular painting?  This painting is titled Wind Songs. It has a watercolor background  technique. Early on in my career while my dad was still here, he painted  at his studio, and I would paint in my living room at home in Locust  Grove. When I brought this piece over, he   s like,    Sis, that is just  beautiful. How did you get that background?    He says,    I know how you  did you it. It   s a watercolor technique with acrylic, and you sprinkled  salt, but how are you getting all that definition?    I said,    Well, Dad   .    I  28  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  Little Thunder  Rabbit  would tease him. I said,    It   s a trade secret.     I brought a canvas over, and I showed him that when you   re working it  wet and you   re applying your color then your salt, if you apply heat, it  makes the salt grab it faster and the water evaporate faster. So you get  this really neat pulling technique faster. On watercolor paper, you   re  going to get that, but when you   re working with canvas, it   s not  absorbent. You have to work around the canvas. I figured out through  experimenting with heat, light, different things, that I was able to do  that, and that was something that I learned on my own. I was so proud to  come to the studio, and he was asking me how I did something   (Laughter)  And you   ve really got some nice texture and beadwork on there, too.  Yeah, and this is part of that. I   ve always been fascinated   I   m a big  collector of beadwork. Again, the Plains culture, just always admired.  Yeah, a lot of detail in that dress.  All right. How about this painting?  This painting here is another twenty-four by thirty-six, titled Special  Moments. This was at a time when I was starting to feel like I had done  enough work with my own different technique that I could come in and  apply, as you see, the blanket area here and the swirls, things that my  dad was well-known for in his work, but have the detail of my faces.  This is actually a picture of myself and my niece. I   m holding my  brother   s little girl who was only still for about three seconds. This is  actually a transition piece, what I would call a transition piece from  Wind Songs to where I   m starting to incorporate what my dad had taught  me with the women, and of course the long hair that was always  signature of his work. I definitely incorporated that into my work  because I wanted to be able to keep his legacy and what he taught me  alive. I feel I can do that through my work.  Well, thank you so much for taking time to talk with me today.  You   re welcome. Thank you.  -------  -------
