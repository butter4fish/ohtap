Story_ID: 111846
Speaker 1: --Okay. So Mr. Gore, I'm sorry, let's begin by talking about your mother actually starting with her name and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --where she was born and how she grew up.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Lillian Naomi Gore.  Her maiden name is Hill and she was born in Amherst, Virginia which is the Tye River [Virginia] area which is actually down the street from the Waltons.  Remember Walton Mountain, Walton Family?  She grew up there and at the age of nineteen, she moved to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  That was a rural area so you still had the outhouse.  You still had the water pump that you had to pump out front from the well.  You know, my father--my grandfather actually owned a lot of land which was actually a blessing because he was not one of--he was one of the more established African Americans of his time so he had something like 2,000, 3,000 acres of land down there.  He sold some to the government as time went on.  I think we have an original two or three hundred acres left down there.  Four of my aunts still live there and she used to tell me all the stories about how they had to you know pick corn, they had to deal with the chickens, you know stuff like that, the horses, the cows you know that whole farm life.  And when you think about how we grew up kind of, we spent every summer there so we at least got a chance to feel it coming through 'cause again it's a rural area.  So they you know just kind of modernized that area so that was great.
Speaker 1: And did she talk about what precipitated her move to Washington, D.C., why she moved to Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: My mother [Lillian Gore] probably was one of the more progressive out of the family that wanted to move up to the big city, things on that level, lot of pride in her.  So she wanted to move.  Everybody was moving to Washington, especially after civil rights, Washington [D.C.], Chicago [Illinois], those were the places to be, and Washington was close by so she moved here.  And actually her sisters that moved up after her stayed at her place till they got established so she was like the "Underground Railroad" for moving out of Amherst.  And so they would come and live with her for a while and get established and get their own place.  And she just you know always a hard worker by growing up on a farm.  And not to have--you know there's no lights so everything was more for a while candles and things like that and then they got electricity running through that area, so they went up to lights and that was a blessing.  But you know you still had the wood burning stoves and three of them in different rooms to keep the heat, cause there's no heating or air conditioning.  So you know it was a great life you know.  So when she moved to the city, I guess it kind of liberated her into becoming who she was going to be as you know she became an adult.
Speaker 1: And what did she do when she first came to Washington, D.C. work-wise?
Speaker 2: If I recall my mother [Lillian Gore] when she first moved here she was cleaning where most African American, that's the job you got normally, especially female was a cleaning position.  And she cleaned I think government buildings, things on that level you know.
Speaker 1: And what did she eventually end up doing?  When you were like a small boy what kind of work did your mother do?
Speaker 2: My mother [Lillian Gore] was a--I watched her change through different careers.  So she went from cleaning and then she used to clean in houses for a family that was kind of known in this area and she cleaned for them for a while.  And then she progressed into the government you know, county government and she became a bus driver and then a bus supervisor and then she retired from the PG [Prince George's] County [Public] School System [Upper Marlboro, Maryland].
Story_ID: 111847
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father starting with his name and where he was born and how he grew up.
Speaker 2: My father's name is George Washington Gore, Sr.  My brother is named after him.  And he grew up in Dalton, Georgia.  And I want to say the date--he's going to kill me--I want to say 26th, [1926] but I won't say 1926, cause he'll probably kill me.  Claims he's eighty, I mean seventy-nine.  My mother [Lillian Gore] said he's eighty, you know.  But he grew up in Georgia.  His entire family is from that area and again, he grew up on a farm too.  So--and their farm was a lot larger than my mother's and them farm.  I mean their farm is huge.  They each called it the, the, the Great House and it's still known as that in our family, the Great House cause it was so huge, all the land.  His mother, I don't know if I'm going too far but his mother--
Speaker 1: Um-um.
Speaker 2: --was actually a--not his mother but his mother's mother children were actually from the slave owner.  So that's how they got the land because as he passed, the slave owner passed away he let them that land and it was a ton, I mean like 8,000, 10,000 acres, you know.  And then it was passed on down through the family.  So he grew up you know--and his stories are way more hilarious than my mother's stories when they grew up, you know. So--
Speaker 1: Can you--do you remember some of those stories that he shared with you, some of the more, funnier ones?
Speaker 2: Oh, the--it's an--my family is hilarious, you know my aunts and uncles.  They just steadily keep it going.  But I think it's only four of them left or five of them left.  But I remember him [George Gore Sr.] telling me a story that you know when he was younger his mother had moved on because of their work situation.  You know it was back then and so normally the grandparents kind of raised the children.  So his grandmother was a real disciplinarian.  I mean back then everybody was but she was extreme.  So they would get certain times to do certain things and he remembered telling me saying he had his, his youngest sister Viola always got in trouble and his grandmother would send him to catch her.  But he know if he catch her, she gonna get the whooping of her life.  So one day they were out there doing something and she screams out--they used to call him G.  G, catch--bring me your sister here.  And he said Viola took off.  And they're just running around the house.  So he said he knew he's faster than her so he just trotting behind her so he don't catch her.  Grandmother being very intelligent saying, I tell you what, if you don't catch her, I'm going to whoop you too.  And he said he just see himself closing on in as he came back around the house and caught her.  But it was just, they had a, I mean so many stories when you hear them talking about them growing up, you know even though it wasn't like we are today, it was amazing how they created their own world and atmosphere and it was more real, the situations you know, disciplinary stuff, having water in the kitchen, didn't have it, get a whooping, you know.  Everything was if you didn't do it, it was a consequence for, you know.  So that's incredible.
Story_ID: 111848
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: Hilarious.  Very stern you know, narrow track for him [George Gore Sr.], you know so it's no left or right.  Very intelligent, very witty, business oriented.  Always you know moving ahead, very progressive.  You know that's probably how him and my mother [Lillian Gore] met actually.
Speaker 1: Do you know how they met?
Speaker 2: My father was in the [U.S.] military so--he was a sergeant in the military and his cousins were ser--were not sergeants but they was in the military also and he actually, he lied about his age to get in the military.  That's how much he wanted to get out of--he got like sixteen, and you know again back on the farm you know you're going through all the rigmarole and they're telling you war getting ready to kick in and he went to the place where you sign up at and told them he as 18 and they let him in.  So he lied about his--and back then they didn't have birth certificates, you know all that stuff, driver's license, all that.  So they let him in at sixteen.  He went all the around the world, Germany, and places like that and ended up meeting my mother here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] because he--it was actually, became one of his stations he had to report to as his tour slowed down and that's how he met my mother.  And you know they used to have little hot spots they'd all go to clubbing and stuff and he met her there.  And he actually used to come over to her apartment.  You know they have that alleyway.  He'd pull up in his car, have wine and stuff in his trunk and all her sisters lived in the same you know area with her so he would be the party guy.  He would throw the party for everybody.  So everybody liked him and she loved him and they got married, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did your dad have a career in the military?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was a Master Sergeant in the military and he did it for thirty years and retired and I think it was sixty--maybe say that date '67 [1967] or '66 [1066], something like that.
Speaker 1: And what did he do after that?
Speaker 2: And after that he went to work for two places, Greyhound [Bus] and--
Speaker 1: As a driver?
Speaker 2: As a driver.  So he drove from the airports out like that.  He did that for years.  And she shifted from Greyhound and then started working for Miller Genuine Draft.  Actually I don't know if you know about New York Avenue [Washington, D.C.], the original Miller Genuine Draft warehouse, that's where my father worked at, as a driver.  And I can remember going down there when I was smaller and you know he'd just always been a popular person.  You know everybody loved him.  So as a kid you know you always got the free stuff being anywhere from chips, sodas, everything 'cause everybody's trying to you know--hey, you G's kid.  Want a soda?  So you know it was great to watch everybody fall in love with your father, have a lot of respect for him, yeah.
Story_ID: 111849
Speaker 1: And one thing I forgot to ask you Mr. Gore, was how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Mother [Lillian Gore], very spiritual, very stern, very loving.  I've watched the compassion that my mother's had for not just her community and her neighborhood but just for the world.  And it really enlightens me that I can remember her always being a person that's there for somebody you know in the family, you know feeding somebody, feeding the homeless, thanksgiving, stuff like that.  And she has a great sense of humor as well and that's probably why her and my father got along so well.  And she just very direct about not quitting, standing up for yourself, being very respectful.  All--always reminding you how, you know you only get this one shot so you know you do it the best way, the best you can.  So she's like a motivator you know and she also is great for when you fall and bust your head, you know.  So she's a comforter.  So you know, so great mother, I mean all the super mother qualities, you know.
Story_ID: 111850
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little about your grandparents, starting with your maternal grandparents, your mother's parents.  Did you spend a lot of time with them?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I mean we spent every summer and this was like normal for families when I was coming up, we spent summers at the country--we used to call it the country.  So we spent two months in Amherst, Virginia and a month down in Florida.  So you know we stayed at the Great House they used to call it and we stayed at my grandfather's house, which is my mother's [Lillian Gore] father.  And my grandmother again, and it's a different generation than now.  They expect more out of you then than they do now.  So back then they gave you the love but they expected more out if you, you know where you had to do chores, you had to do this, do that, you know.  They send you somewhere you had to go.  Had to show your intelligence 'cause you had to keep what they said in your mind and do it right.  So you know they expected--that bar was high.  My grandfather was just great in showing you things about nature, horses, you know teaching you about farm stuff.  Everybody in the community loved him.  I mean I was just blessed to look at, grow up around adults where people really admired them for what they stood for and his word goes and you know everybody kind of came to his house you know uncles, cousins that couldn't you know further their life, they would come there.  And that's what I always learned that they would you know take care of you.  If somebody got off track, you could come there but you couldn't live for free.  They'd work you, so they you working the farm, stuff like that.  And a very stern, you know tall man.  My grandfather probably was about 6'2", was very tall, very big guy, and same thing on my father's [George Gore, Sr.] side.
Story_ID: 111851
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your paternal grandparents.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I never met my paternal grandparents.  I was--my, my oldest--my brother [George Gore, Jr.] that's above me met him.  I have never met him, but I hear great stories about him that my grandfather had like a strong mean streak so he was very stern.  And his name was Dozier Gore.  And humorous in the evening, stern in the daytime, again keeping that high standard, that high bar up there.  But you know a friend to the community, always giving.  They were known for their cookouts that they would give and just you know a lot of space.  So they would have all the food, all the drinks you know everybody congregate and joke and laugh like that and so that was just great to know about them on that level.
Story_ID: 111852
Speaker 1: And can you give us the names of your siblings and their birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My brother, his birthday is January 17.  My sister is--
Speaker 1: And what's your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Oh, George W. Gore, Jr.--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is his name.  And he's on the seventeenth.  Actually my sister is born the same day.  They're both on the seventeenth.  I have an older brother Richard--
Speaker 1: And your sister's name?
Speaker 2: My sister's name is Athena Wilson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now my oldest brother, Richard Hill, he was born in January.  All of us are Capricorns if you go by signs.  He was born in January also.  My birthday is December 23, and I guess that makes me a Capricorn too.  So we--they used to jip me all the time because my birthday was first and it was close to Christmas.  So you know, I would kind of have to get pushed into the January celebration where all of their birthdays are in January.  So you know that was just wild.
Speaker 1: And so you're the youngest of four children?
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest of--well five actually.  I have another sister, Gale and I believe she's like fifty-two, and her birthday is in August if I'm not mistaken and she's from my--a previous marriage from my father before he met my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's five of us altogether.  So I have two sisters and two brothers.  And like I say, I--just coming up I just always remember them saying you know your birthday is today but you know we're going to do something in January for all of you.  So you know that--and I didn't mind.  I just had fun.  I didn't look at birthdays like that.  It was just you know we were a festive family so holidays they gave cookouts all the time you know so it was nothing new, you know.
Story_ID: 111853
Speaker 1: Tell me what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest, probably--we have a traveler--my mother[Lillian Gore] and father [George Gore Sr.] were travelers so in the summer time you know we would go places constantly.  So I think I was like probably four or five, I remember going to the beach.  Think it was Sandy Point [Annapolis, Maryland] they called it you know and our cousins lived down there.  So we used to go hang out with them all the time and I can just remember always being in the water because from that beach to going to Florida, again by the water cause my family lived near the water there so always being around water, beaches, outdoors.  And I can remember that time at that beach and they told me later that was--I almost drowned.  So you know you kind of walk out, you drift, the undercurrent caught me.  But I was walking and my brother George who is above me, saved me, swam out and got me.  So they always say you need to thank your brother cause he the one saved your life, so those are you know some fond memories of always being outside, always being outdoors, constantly going places.  You know it was just--we wasn't at home a lot, you know.  My father and mother always had something planned, somewhere to go, somewhere to be.
Story_ID: 111854
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about what holidays were like in your house growing up?  I mean were they very festive, special times?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother [Lillian Gore] is a holiday fanatic, so is my father [George Gore Sr.].  My father will crank a grill up on the drop of a dime.  So--and 4th of July was my grandfather's greatest holiday so it passed over to my mother.  And the 4th of July, my mother had the flags out, flag candles, flag lights on the house, red, white and blue stuff up.  I mean she just goes all the way out.  And so just every time we had a holiday from Easter on out, my mother was very festive, you know.  She goes with the scenery, the bunny out Easter time, that kind of stuff.  So it's incredible that you know we were able to enjoy so many holidays every year and they did it like it was the first time it happened you know, so it was fun each time, you know.  So I can remember my mother for Christmas time, one special Christmas, I think I was probably around six, I would say six or seven and back then you know they didn't have Metro and stuff like that.  And my father worked for Greyhound so you know sometimes he had long trips.  And that year something happened where we didn't get a Christmas tree and it was probably something financial, I don't know.  But you know it kind of, you know when you're young you think about Christmas differently.  And you know, you're kind--the house was kind of like sorrow because we're thinking there ain't no Christmas tree, you know.  And I can remember my mother had to walk from--had a Greyhound or a bus depot that was probably I want to say 13, 14 blocks, maybe more and had to walk it every morning because all the transportation came to that location, taxicabs, everything if we need to get around and they used to call it "the line".  And I can remember it was snowing that Christmas and I'm looking out the window cause it's about the time for my mother to be coming in.  and it was so funny when I looked out the window and I'm looking up this, you know you could see up the street, my mother is dragging a tree.  And I'm thinking to myself, now I'm thinking I didn't know it then, I was more happy to know that she brought a tree, it was on her mind to have a tree for us.  So she's dragging this tree all the way down the street you know to get to our house, get it in, set it up and we're all going crazy cause we got a tree and it's not till this--I got older I thought about it.  Dag, in the snow my mother dragged a tree fourteen blocks, you know.  Most of people these days can't even lift a basket up, she drags a whole tree.  But that was the devotion she had for us as a mother always being a--make sure we, you know got the full fulfillment out of everything that we did or whatever came up and I thought that was just, you know you want to talk about being a mother, that was strong, you know to make sure they got a tree.  She drags this thing 13, 14 blocks, you know.
Story_ID: 111855
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your community where you grew up?  Can you kind of describe your block for us or--and describe the community?  Do you remember the name of the street you lived on?
Speaker 2: Actually I was born in Washington, D.C.  So I--people have recollections before certain ages.  I don't know why I don't have them, you know.  Maybe I was born at four or five, but I hear people say I remember when I was two.  I can never think that far back.  But my mother [Lillian Gore] (unclear) I was born in D.C. [Washington], so I can't think of the street we lived on.  I want to say Meridian Place is where we lived before my father [George Gore, Sr.] moved to Maryland which it was called Holly Park [Maryland] at that time.
Speaker 1: Holly Park, H-O-L-L-Y?
Speaker 2: Yes, Holly Park.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And well do you remember like the community?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think we lived on it was called F Street, yeah.  Actually I remember the address, 7204 F Street [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And describe it for us.
Speaker 2: Oh wow, this was a great--we lived in a park so when we moved there probably five years later, they had built a park in our neighborhood.  And it was a great neighborhood because you had to cross a bridge to enter into our neighborhood so it was like a little bridge over a creek to come into the neighborhood.  The other way out of the neighborhood was through the park over bridges you had to walk over.  And it was just a great time that you could walk four blocks down the street and you're in a park, you know.  And back then they had the playgrounds, you know.  The biggest thing then was the merry-go-round.  I mean that was big when it hit the community, you know so all were merry-go-round fanatics.  And I think later on they put a store right by when you walk in over the bridge and they--it was a 7--it was a hamburger place at first.  It changed about four times, from a hamburger place to a convenience store, finally a 7 Eleven bought it.  It went from a 7 Eleven to another guy bought it.  So it kept changing but it was convenient that it was right across the street from us you know one block up.  So anything you needed something you just walked one block up and get it.  So--and the neighborhood was very close.  All the characters in the world lived in our neighborhood.  So--
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of them?  Can you describe some of them for us?
Speaker 2: Oh wow, we just--I mean--and this--my neighbors, the Whites, Eric--it was like seven of us that really hung out, Eric White, James White, they were brothers, Linwood Giles was on the right side of me, they were older than I was.  Then we had--it's a guy named T-Bird, you know short and round.  So we had some great characters in the neighborhood and the neighborhood was very adventurous because it was still rural even though you had homes more modernized.  We used to go down in the creek and stuff like that and hang out down that way, crossing over the water.  Then we'd end up tying a hose to a tree and we would swing across, you know.  I mean it was just so adventurous and we always got warned not to go down in there.  Don't go in the creek and that meant like, go to the creek, so you know.  And I think of the places now, I drive back around my old neighborhood to me when I was younger it seemed so much further.  You know when we walked to a certain place, it's like it took forever.  And when I drive, I'm like that was only up the street you know.  But we used to go through the woods to get there you know.  So--
Story_ID: 111856
Speaker 1: Mr. Gore, tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights would be summer.  When I think of summer I think of Holly Park [Maryland] because it was just the time everybody was out.  You know smells, very fresh, you know the evergreen, they could be--that's why I guess they named it Holly Park because it had so many trees, beautiful like that.  What was the other two?
Speaker 1: And--sights, sounds and smells, so what sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sounds would be music.  Music was big when we were coming up.  Whenever I hear any of Motown's [Detroit, Michigan] sounds, I can just remember hearing that out of somebody's window you know coming up in the summer.  That's why summer means--cause you get, you know you don't have your windows up in the winter but in the summer you have them up so you can always hear Motown come out of somebody's radio.  And when we're playing in the street right there you could just hear the music.  So that whole Motown era makes you think of the neighborhood all the time.
Story_ID: 111857
Speaker 1: What was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to Oak Crest [Elementary School, Landover, Maryland] which was up the street from us also, Elementary and I spent I think two years there.  And my life is funny cause it's kind of historic because I was born in 1966, Civil Rights Movement.  And I was a product of when the busing kicked in so we got bussed from Oak Crest to Berwyn Heights [Maryland] in Green, in that Greenwood area.  So I went to Berwyn Heights to finish out the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: So now let me ask you a little bit about Oak Crest.  So was that a predominantly black school?
Speaker 2: Yes, when I went to Oak Crest.  That was the neighborhood kids, we all went there.  And I might have been in Oak Crest first and second grade.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your teachers from Oak Crest?
Speaker 2: I sure--I mean that's the thing I say when I hear people reminisce, I remember my mother [Lillian Gore] used to use these kind of diapers on me.  I'm like, how they remember back then.  But I can remember going to Oak Crest and I probably remember Oak Crest more because we had a couple of plays there as you know the interaction and that makes me think of the stage at Oak Crest more than the teachers.  And I can remember--and that's when crossing guards were big so you know we had a certain crossing guard.  I remember she was a nice, pretty fair-skinned lady would always be there for us in the morning cause we walked to school every day.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about do you remember when you found out you were going to be going to this new school in a different neighborhood that was a little further way, do you remember that conversation (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can remember my mother telling us it was a good thing that you know we would get exposure to other things, you know widen our horizon, you know.  So--and I can remember her always instructing us about our behavior.  You know when you go there you go there to learn you know and I guess it was the first time that we got the true interaction with interracial and where they fought it and never did have it, now where we have it.  So they're saying don't blow it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, don't go there and be no jerk.  Go there and learn and excel.  And we all went with that in our minds to excel so it gave us an edge over the other students because they're used to it, we're not.  So you know for them to get a B, they were happy.  We had to get the A.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know so that was a great part.
Speaker 1: And what was Berwyn Heights like?
Speaker 2: Berwyn Heights [Maryland], great school.  Interracial era, I didn't really see it.  I made friends immediately.  The teachers you know I found--my first teacher was Ms. Hardin and she was just crazy about me, you know. And actually I was on a cooking show when I was in school and they had called my mother to say is it okay if we use him for a cooking show?  We had to make bread on TV for this news thing and I think I was like four or something like that.  And--no, I may have been a little--I was like six.
Story_ID: 112020
Speaker 1: --Okay.  So Mr. Gore, tell us a little bit about this cooking show that you were on.  About what year was this?
Speaker 2: The year I probably couldn't give you unless I start thinking back right now.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was probably about six years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So probably like early '70s [1970s], 1971 or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, early '70s [1970s].  And it seemed like you know all the stuff that had to be done in the class for the black student they would be picking me.
Speaker 1: So you were the black representative?
Speaker 2: I was the black representation for the class.  So she called my mother [Lillian Gore], Ms. Hardin called, my teacher called and said is it okay if we use Roger in a cooking show?  My mother was like a cooking show?  Yeah, they're going to bake bread on TV.  She's like, I guess so.  So I can remember going to the studio for them to shoot the show and I guess I was so--you know you watch TV, well we didn't watch a lot back then but still it was so amazing.  But to see cameras and you know the mics and stuff, you know that was more nervous than actually cooking and baking the bread, you know.  And it turned out pretty well.  I don't even have a tape of it cause we didn't have tapes and stuff back then but I wish I could find that.  But you know it was a great experience for me, kind of interviewed us on TV.  And when I got home I was just, you know everybody saw me so they were just teasing me you know about being on TV baking bread so, you know, it was kind of cool.

Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about, what type of child were you?  During--around the elementary school age time, what type of child were you?  Were you well-mannered, mischievous, what type of child were you?
Speaker 2: I was--I'm probably like you know I was really you know adventurous but I had my limitations and I think I always worked outside my limitations because as--you know I was diagnosed when I was younger I think around six years old with sickle cell disease.  So I caught the whole thing.  I mean I didn't--and some people skip it.  I caught all of it. So my father [George Gore Sr.] by being retired from the military, you know we kind of grew up in Walter Reed's Hospital so one of the better hospitals in Washington, D.C.  And they diagnosed me with sickle cell disease so I was sick a lot.  So you know you have crisis all the time and as your body's changing and you're getting older, I can just--you know they give you all the limitations and in my--I had--my spleen had grew outside my rib cage so I had to be watched a lot so you got an adventurous child that need to be watched cause if you hit me, you know I could bleed and die.  So they'd just like keep pumping that in my head, got to be careful.  And I can remember, you know I just, I always played.  I always ran and my mother would just sweat, constantly just thinking, where is he at?  And I just remember my father always taking me, because I'd probably have a crisis--it would last a week.
Story_ID: 112022
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe to us like what a crisis is and what impact it would have on your body?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  If you've never had it, I wouldn't wish it on you.  I mean, just imaging just having a heart attack constantly.  It's a constant heart attack because it's like you know your blood it forms a sickle so it can't pass through the vein so it blocks everything.  So when you have a heart attack it's normally for a blocked artery.  So when you have sickle cell disease you don't know where it's going to happen at.  It can clog in your leg your arms your back.  It's wherever your veins are, wherever the sickle is at.  So--and it lasts you know for weeks.  So you know I would be out of school, doing my homework from home.
Speaker 1: So would you have to be in the hospital during this time or would you be recovering at home?
Speaker 2: There's nothing that they could do for you.  Sickle cell is like--I guess it was like Alzheimer [Alzheimer's disease] is now.  There's nothing they can do for you.  And by it being more of an African American disease they wasn't really, you know--by my father being in the military they were more attentive to me cause he was a sergeant.  But in reality they're saying I mean we aren't even studying this.  So they did come up with some recommendations later like drink a lot of fluids.  I had to drink I mean I can just remember drinking--my mother had me drinking water or juice every other hour because it's supposed to have been good for circulation, not exert myself which I did constantly and that's probably why I was sick so much cause I always exerted myself.  And--
Speaker 1: So would you just be in pain for like these periods of time?
Speaker 2: Oh it's, it's hard to describe.  It's all day, you know.  You know how you may have a headache and it go away or have an arm ache and it go away?  Just imagine having a heart attack all day for days.  So the only rest you get is to go to sleep if you can get to sleep.  If you can get to sleep then you don't feel it.  As you wake up, it wakes up with you so you start a whole new day with it.  And mine was real bad so I mean I would be under the table you know that kind of stuff, up under the bed, in a corner, you know.  And I can just remember my mother always just like you know rubbing me.  I smelled like Bengay all--that's when Bengay was hot.  I think it may have just came out.  I had so much Bengay on me from here on down.  Hot towels, they had to put hot towels on me all the time you know.  I mean they came up with their own remedies actually her and my father.  They--cause they found out what would make me not squirm as much and--
Speaker 1: And have you pretty much outgrown it or do you still suffer from it?
Speaker 2: My mother [Lillian Gore] claims she's prayed it away from me 'cause you know back then they--I'm trying to think of my doctor's name that was the original one.  And my mother will probably say it right out.  She passed away.  But what happened was is that you know you couldn't fly because of the oxygen in your body, you know it could give you a heart attack.  So you had this long list of things you could not do.  So it was like all left you could do was eat and walk, you know.  But I kind of broke all of the you know--when it was time to play football, I couldn't play football but I played football anyway and you know they were kind of--I'm just--I was a troubled child you know.  I would give you a heart attack because you're saying he's not supposed to play football and he's playing football 'cause if somebody hit me, you know it could rupture my spleen.  So my father had found this rib cage thing.  I think they had just came out where you wear the rib cage and when the doctor found out they immediately had to take me off the team because I played several years before she got hip to it.  But my father kind of allowed me to cheat saying well we'll put this rib cage on you it will probably protect me from getting hit.  My mother was totally against it. But I don't know how--I think my mother might have leaked it to the doctor so when the doctor found out, yeah they pulled me off so I couldn't play anymore.  So you know I just went to the other sports at that point and they didn't want you to play sports 'cause you couldn't exert yourself cause when you lose oxygen in your body is when you really start the sickle when you dehydrate.  And I think me breaking all the rules kind of like made me sicker all the time, you know.  And I can just remember spending my--up until like eighteen--
Story_ID: 112023
Speaker 1: But so you really don't, you don't suffer from it as much now?
Speaker 2: I did for a while.  I think you know my mother [Lillian Gore] is very protective so people didn't even know 'cause I'd just disappear you know.  You seen Roger?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they didn't know I'd be upstairs sick as a dog, back and forth to the hospital late at night waking up.  And I think I got like 18, by me being on my own, I got on my own early, moved out like 18, 19 years old and I would fly.  So you know my mother [Lillian Gore] would just remind me and they say don't do this, you do it.  They told you not to fly, now you're flying.  So I would fly and she would just call me everyday whatever city I was in, how do you feel, such and such.  When I get home I was sickle.  So that's when I would get sick when I get home.  So you know it's a thin line because do you call and tell her you're sick so she can remind you, you shouldn't be flying?  So you know I just--my father [George Gore Sr.] would always stay in my mind, don't let it slow you down.  That's why I guess he supported me kind of.  He said you know it shouldn't stop you and I'm kind of proud that you can go through it.  But when I hear like TLC talk about it you know I'm older than her so I hear her talk about it, I can--it brings back my memories that people really don't know how--if you have sickle cell disease--the trait is different.  But if you have the disease they could never understand that pain.  I mean that thing--you can't even walk.  You know if it hits your leg you can't walk.  I mean if you go to stand, it'll just punish you.  So if it hits your back you can't sit up.  If it hits your--you know you can't sleep on your arm and that was a big thing.  They said you couldn't sleep on any of your body parts.  So my mother just constantly checking my room make sure I'm sleeping on my back or my stomach cause if you sleep on your arm, wake up in the morning, sickle you know, pain.  And like I say it's not something that you can take.  I was so happy when Motrin came out (unclear) old enough to take it because it gave you an hour relief in between time.  So when I hear TLC talk about it and my wife always kicks me, I can just--my stuff comes up vivid as if it was yesterday, you know.  My brother and them was real loving with me with it because they knew I couldn't go out.  They'd come and hang out with me and stuff, my sister come up and kick it with me.
Story_ID: 112024
Speaker 1: Tell me this Mr. Gore, during the elementary school years around that time period in your life, did you have dreams and aspirations?  Like what did you want to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I think I built myself slowly.  So my biggest thing and I don't want to hang on the sickle cell too long but my biggest thing was my determination was built from sickle cell.  So whenever you have dreams, you got to have everything it takes to achieve it.  And I think my determination was built from that.  That you know I'm just going to withstand this, you know.  And I didn't really dream of being anything.  My life was right in front of me so like when I got a bike, you know that was my dream at that point was the bike.
Speaker 1: Sure, sure.
Speaker 2: So I mean I could ride places and stuff like that you know.  But it had--you know my father [George Gore Sr.] really instilled, and my mother [Lillian Gore] did was the characteristics more than me dreaming about who I wanted to be, they were just trying to prepare me to be the strongest person I could be.  I always teased them, you made me a soldier and then now y'all complaining I work too much.  Y'all made me this way.  So I can just remember that my father having conversations with me about how to carry yourself and you can be anything you want to be so it was more broader.  He was saying anything you want to be you can be, but it's not going to be easy.  And I think he admired me 'cause like I say with my sickness I still achieved a pretty normal life, you know.
Story_ID: 112025
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about junior high school.  What was the name of the junior high school you attended?
Speaker 2: Benjamin Tasker Junior High.
Speaker 1: In Bowie, Maryland?
Speaker 2: Bowie, Maryland.  Welcome to the big league.
Speaker 1: So what was that like?
Speaker 2: Benjamin Tasker was a prominent school back then.  I don't know--you know people that know about the--I mean it was a very--and that's what's unique about life.  Nothing's wrong with Oak Crest Elementary [Landover, Maryland] in my neighborhood.  But we got bused into one of the more prominent schools which was Berwyn Heights [Elementary School, Berwyn Heights, Maryland] and from there we went to one of the more prominent schools which was Benjamin Tasker.  And you know I was a, you know straight A student, you know because you know my mother [Lillian Gore] would make you do your homework before you could do anything else.  So when I got to Benjamin Tasker--now my brother [George Gore, Jr.] being two years older than me always went somewhere before I got there so he'd break the ground.  So when I hit Benjamin Tasker, that was a middle school and the first day it was so much different because you had a locker when you didn't have a lock in elementary you know.  And they kind of you know gave you more freedom so you felt older.  And I can remember walking to that building like wow, cause it was bigger than elementary.  And you know and the bus ride was longer kind of you know.  So I was just flabbergasted when I first walked in there you know and I'm--I've arrived to middle school now, you know.  And the books was never a problem for me.  So when most kids worried about work, I didn't worry about the work and I think you know when I was sick and I'm at home, I had more time to do homework and read so I never worried about the work part.  I was more with the atmosphere, you know.  They had the thing of the, logo on the school on the wall.  I was like, wow!
Story_ID: 112026
Speaker 1: At that time, Bowie [Maryland] where you went to school was still a predominantly white area.  Was there any resistance to, you know black kids coming in, going to that particular school?  What--was there any resistance to that?
Speaker 2: Well it was funny that we had a black vice principal, Mr. Banks and when I say black, Mr. Banks was black, all sense of the word you know.
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: He was dark.  You know he was one of the darker--he was real dark, you know.  And he had white teeth but you never saw them cause he just all--had that face as if he could break you in half at any time, you know.  So he was a, he was a thick fellow and he had them reverend hands you know just swallow your hand up.  So I could remember that he had a conversation with me about my schooling and he was saying--and you know it's funny like I say I had an interesting life because I have kind of lived history and I can remember him telling me you know you're kind of smart and you know we need blacks to achieve.  I mean he gave me the whole scholar thing you know.  He was kind of like, don't worry about sports.  I want you to achieve in school 'cause you're kind of smart.  So he would be that motivation factor behind me saying you know take this class, do this where they don't, I don't think they have that now but back then they gave guidance.  But I was playful so you know I could walk both sides of the street you know hang out with the guys but then I get an A in class so you couldn't really punish me as much and the white kids liked me.  So all the way through elementary and you know junior high, I picked up well with the white kids as well as with the sisters and brothers, so I was the medium again, so I mean--
Story_ID: 112027
Speaker 1: I thought that was great, but I can remember a situation in Benjamin Tasker [Junior High, Bowie, Maryland] with something with--I can't think of the child's name but it was a parent that came up there.  You know Bowie [Maryland] was kind of rural too and racism was you know kind of flourishing over there.  And you could never experience it but that day I did 'cause I heard her say the word nigger in the sense of a child.  And I can remember the principal kind of like defending it which I, you know till this day I probably--I admire more than I did then and back then I was just thinking they're going to burn the school down.  But she was like you know and all these niggers done moved up here and such and such and such and these niggers are coming in this school and taking the seats and stuff.  And the principal was just you know he was--I'm trying to think of my principal's name.  I want to say Weinberger, he handled it you know.  And I was just by the water fountain and I can remember that day by being sheltered from racism, to hear it for the first time because all--you know I had white buddies, black buddies you know.  You don't see racism as a child.  But that day by her being an adult and say that word nigger, I was like, still not understanding but I could kind of feel it a little bit.  And I you know, I kind of asked my mother [Lillian Gore] about it and I can remember my mother telling me, that's how dumb people talk.  I said, wow.
Story_ID: 112028
Speaker 1: And so during the junior high school years did you--what were some of your dreams and aspirations then?  What were you thinking that you wanted to be when you grew up and what were you thinking that you wanted to do when you grew up?
Speaker 2: You know that's what's so wild 'cause I mean when people talk to me now you know, I'm start--my life is starting to evolve now you know getting awards and all this other stuff.  But people always ask me that and I have to be honest about it, I was right here with my life.  You know when I hit junior high, I was about junior high.  I didn't even think about high school or being an astronaut.  I was right with junior high, you know.  And I can just remember influential people being in control of where I was going so you got put in this class because somebody thought you would do well in that class.  So people kind of took care of you.
Speaker 1: And you always--it sounds like you always kind of had somebody looking out for you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and who could see that you, there was something special within you?
Speaker 2: My mother was like behind the scenes as the consultant, whatever cause they would call her, well we're going to put Roger in this class.  And so--and you know it was big decisions back then I guess.  And I would end up in this class and I just performed.  So you know like I say the books never bothered me so I'm just there working and people are figuring out where you're going.  I'm just there working so, you know--
Story_ID: 112029
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about what kind of young man were you starting to become?
Speaker 2: I was in between hip and not hip.  You know I was in that point in my life where--because my father [George Gore Sr.] was so cool and my mother [Lillian Gore] was just--my mother and them were--my mother had the cigarette lighter--I mean the cigarette holder with the cigarette on the end so they had all the cocktail parties.  So I was kind of you know coming into my own then and you know never been a--I was an ugly duckling you know.  You know I'm still ugly now but I was uglier then.  But I can remember you know my sister had a lot of girlfriends.  My sister was way older than I was so they were kind of pumping me up as I was coming up, you know he's so, you know cause I was stuck with my sister cause my sister would watch everybody.  And I can remember in junior high school my sister wanted to go see Rick James and my mother said well you got to take him, 'cause they worked at night too.  She said you got to take him with you.  And I'm thinking to myself, I'm at a Rick James concert.  This man is throwing down.  My sister and them are smoking herb, so you know back then you know how they used to have the cloud smoke of herb on the--at the ceiling at the Capital Centre, my sister and them get back and my sister was--I got to admire her because I just don't know if I could hang out with my youngest--you know that must have been torture to her.  But she loved it, you know.  To me I guess she loved it but she didn't never look at me like, I can't believe they stuck me with you again.  So I'm sitting in the seat and I guess it's getting on my clothes.  So when I get home, I'm the fire alarm 'cause soon as I walked through the door my mother said what's that smell?  And my sister is saying, what smell?  And it's on me.  And she's smelling me up and down, you smell like--you know they used to call it reefer back then.  Reefer!  Somebody been smoking reefer?  And my sister just had to spill the beans at that point, you know.  Well--and she never did say herself.  She was like well they were in there smoking it and it was everywhere.  My mother was like who would let you smoke that in--you know, cause she couldn't understand that.  And you know, I got--
Speaker 1: And how did reefer get all over my baby here?
Speaker 2: Right.  But then I went to school the next day and I got to, you know tell everybody I was at the Rick James concert and they was like, how did you go to Rick James--so I was like a hit for a day 'cause everybody was asking me about the concert and stuff like that.  And that's when I really saw what cool was and that probably started to influence me a little bit to recognize--you know how you start sensing yourself cause at first I didn't.  And I just start you know working on my cool at that point a little bit, but keeping my, you know my grades were my first passion, was always trying to impress my mother and father, you know scholar-wise.  So...
Story_ID: 112030
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: And what were those experiences like?
Speaker 2: Now my father [George Gore Sr.] was a big churchgoer but it was Christian-ly based.  I just remember always watching my father read the bible.  My mother [Lillian Gore] was a churchgoer and we got dragged every Sunday.  But you know you think about church back then was the parents got hip.  I always say the older generation was always ahead of the curve.  So we would have more playtime at church than church time.  So you go there and you would read up on somebody you know Paul or Jesus for thirty minutes (claps hands)--straight to the church field.  They got a football out there for you, horseshoes, basketball you know so you didn't mind going because it was some entertainment there.  And my mother just always tried to instill in us that you know it's her job to watch us while we're younger but it becomes God's job as you get older and you need to have a relationship with him.  So you might not appreciate what we're doing now and I can remember that being a big conversation with everything sometimes.  You may not appreciate it now but you'll appreciate it later.  And we made a lot of friends in church cause the, you know the reverend's kids was always the baddest kids seemed like it.  And he had a son, Randy, that just stayed in a fight every Sunday with somebody cause they'd pick on him being the pastor's child and he'd have to defend himself.  So we would start off playing football and around thirty minutes in the game he rolling around with somebody, you know.  So--
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Harmony Hills First Baptist Church, little church.  This--they probably picked this church up from Amherst, Virginia, Tye River [Virginia] area and brought it here cause it had the wood floor, you know it was--it wasn't no brick church.  It was, you know the church-church.  And I can remember the musical talent was strong there because if my mother had to go back, I would be dragged back with her.  So when they had the bands you know how they do the stuff in the evening, I mean that place be jumping so hard, you know.  That's why I said I live now in a time where I guess it's more orchestrated.  Back then it just be people falling out.  I'm a little kid, they're doing the holy circle you know, fanning.  And the ushers be on it, you know water, fans, people just falling out.  So you know you don't really recognize what it is but you kind of grow up like they must be happy about something you know, crying in the--I can just remember the pastor being so compassionate, you know.  Like he knew--they knew your name, Roger, put his hand on you.  Ask you how you're doing in school.  You know just made you feel like you know this the pastor?  'Cause he was big in the community, but he knew your name and everything.  And it was real personal.  So I did enjoy that.
Story_ID: 112031
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about high school.  What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: My high school was Crossland High School [Temple Hills, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Crossland High School?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Crossland High School.  And like again, my brother [George Gore, Jr.] being two years ahead of me always broke the ground.  And I can remember--I'm going to step back one second to junior high--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --to kind of remind me of high school.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: That was my first prom or whatever.
Speaker 1: In junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know so it kind of prepared me for high school.  But the prom was so funny because you know you can't drive.  So we're having a prom and you can't drive?  So I had two dates.  But I didn't have a date though for real.  It was just two girls from the neighborhood, two bookworms like me that was in my class went with me, you know cause I wasn't hip enough for the other girls but these girls was cool with me.  And one name was Sylvia Blakely and Sylvia was a serious bookworm.  Me and her stayed in the same class seemed like it for a long time.  And I'm trying to think who else was that, that went with us.  I have pictures somewhere.  I'll show you one.  But my father [George Gore Sr.] drove us there and I got my little three piece suit on and we get out, he's giving me all these instructions you know.  And I think the part that made me laugh the most, so we went into the prom, had a great time you know.  And like I said it wasn't really no dating thing so everybody really was just there dancing and socializing.  And I can remember coming out thinking my father had dropped me off and was coming back to pick me up, he never left.  He out in the car with a little TV you know and his best buddy, Mr. Washington, which was my, we used to call him a play uncle back there, he went with him.  So they're both in the front seat drinking beer, watching TV waiting on us to come out for an hour and half.  I thought--I was too you know--when you think about your mother [Lillian Gore] and father now you just think that's too funny to sit out in front of a place for two hours waiting on your son to come out from some little dance, you know.  So I just remember that vaguely in my mind.  The following two weeks, school was over and people were like scaring us about high school.  Like man, high school is different.  You know they had three schools then.  Now you got two.  And I was like you know--my brother hung with his group so you know getting prepared for that, you always got the new clothes you know and getting ready to go into high school.  And it was a bigger bus and I could remember high school being a little more violent than junior high school.
Story_ID: 112032
Speaker 1: And was it mainly though fist fights and that?  What was the violence like in high school?
Speaker 2: Well you know, as you get older again you look back now and understand somebody's motives.  And back then we had bullies and bullies normally to me as I'm older now, understand they evolve from broken homes or parents are not there.  They're reaching out for real and they feel like their only way to get attention is to demand it.  And we had a ton of bullies when I came up and I guess that's why I got my humor from my father [George Gore Sr.] because I'm thinking to myself, I was the protector of the nerds, you know.  So I'm either going to get out of this with my humor or you know I had a--my mother [Lillian Gore] always said I was the meanest child so I had a mean streak.  And I just remember when I got to high school I was hanging with this guy, Tony Proctor, who was up another street from me.  And first day we get there, that's how we get welcomed to school, they take his lunch.  And he's sitting in the lunch room lunch time, I'm getting ready to eat my lunch.  I'm looking at him like where your lunch at?  Somebody took it.  Who took your lunch?  And he just pointed to the guy that took his lunch.  So I can remember saying to myself well, I'll hang with him tomorrow and you know cause this is terrible.  And he was light-skinned and you know how that worked.  So it was you know--we don't talk as much now about it but back then the light skinned brothers got picked on real serious you know by the bullies.  So I can remember us walking down the hallway, getting off the bus and here he come, the guy's name was Brody.  Brody was huge, dark-skinned, I mean like an iron.  And he said, you got my lunch?  And I'm, and I'm pumping Tony up saying, don't give him your lunch.  Tell him you won't give him your lunch.  He said (holds up hand).  So he went to give the lunch, I snatched the lunch.  And as I go to snatch the lunch, now he comes my direction to hit me.
Speaker 1: This is Brody?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is Brody, I mean big dude to hit me.  And this is where having family comes in there.  All my cousins went to that school and my brother above me.  So as he comes to, to hit me, he looks at me and it stops him.  And he says, you got a brother go to this school?  I said yeah, my brother named George.  They call him Vince.  Oh, okay.  And then my oldest brother went to that school.  They broke it in.  This when it was real racial, Richard Hill, my sister Athena, they broke the school in, fights every day, fighting white boys, all that kind of stuff.  And they used to call me Little Hill at that point because they attached me all the way to my oldest brother.  And that was like my shield of armor at that point and you know gave his lunch back, we walked on to lunch.  So I guess they're saying, the nerds are saying we're hanging with Roger 'cause that's the security of the school right now.  And I've always been blessed that they kind of introduced me you know.  My brother--my cousins, the Hills which is my mother's maiden name, Alfonso Hill, Mark Hill, Anthony Hill, Orlando Hill, they were the superstars of the school, basketball.  My brother was a wrestling champ.  And at that point I couldn't really do sports 'cause the sickle cell was killing me.  And I can remember playing in the park in stuff or at school and they pick me on a team.  No, I can't play no basket--you know, I could play but you know they're bigger than me.  And my cousin used to always block me in a corner and say it's this one shot I'm going to show you, this set shot.  I'm going to block them and just shoot it and I got good at this, this shot.  So he would come down the court, had me in the corner over there, kick me the ball, block and I would shoot and make it.  But what it did for me was it kind of let me hang with the, you know kids when I was more like a bookworm.  And I can just remember my cousin and them you know just dividing that comfort for me, my brothers and them.  So everybody liked me, older too, so you know they see me, Little Hill, you know, that kind of stuff.  And you know it made a great experience.

Speaker 1: So Mr. Gore, we were kind of talking a little bit about high school [Crossland High School, Temple Hills, Maryland].  Do you remember some of your teachers from high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Mr.--I'm trying to think of his name.  He was so funny of a teacher.  And that's bad I can't credit my teacher.  And we actually got our class reunion coming up.  I have to get on board with this thing.
Speaker 1: What did he teach?
Speaker 2: He taught art.  And you had to have musical or art back then and he could always draw these characters, you know teach us how to draw them real quickly.  And he was like a comedian so where everybody else was stern, had a high bar, he was the comedian of the school.  So you could go in there for that hour, you had to be relaxed and you know he wasn't stressed.  Didn't nobody bother him.  He taught us how to draw and stuff, music stuff and he was just real, you know very motivational you know.  And all the teachers were--I don't even remember having any black teachers.  All our teachers were white, you know, if I'm not mistaken.
Story_ID: 111872
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in high school [at Crossland High School, Temple Hills, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I didn't have it.  You know like I said I'm just--
Speaker 1: You enjoyed all of them, um-hmm.
Speaker 2: In English I was good and I got the highest English exam test grade.  I mean I was just, you know, math I was good, computers you know--when we got to computers that was incredible because you know that's when they had the data cards.  And that was a, just an incredible experience you know learning that--how computers worked, how they write the programs, all that stuff.  So getting that early was great.  I got that my first year of high school.  So you know I just enjoyed school, you know.
Speaker 1: And so at this point tell me now, so in high school, what were you thinking that you wanted to do with your life?  Were you starting to think about it a little bit then?
Speaker 2: Not in 10th and 11th grade.  I probably didn't get to it till 12th grade.
Speaker 1: And so what were you thinking around your senior year that you wanted to do with your life?
Speaker 2: Well the counselors kind of kept me in computers.  And like I say back then you know when you say what were you thinking, it was what were they thinking?  They was thinking well this guy is good with computers, math, all this stuff so he might be a programmer or something like that so they kept me in the computer program.  And then when I got to 12th grade, you know back then it was funny because I only needed one credit to graduate so they had started this program where we only got one credit so we don't need you to go to school all day.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: If you get you a job you can leave at 11 o'clock.  So I didn't go a full day in 12th grade.  So they got me a job at the, at NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: At NOAA?
Speaker 2: Right, in the computer room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I would go there at 12 o'clock every day and work till 4.  And that's when I guess my ad, admirations probably kicked in that hey, maybe I might be in computers you know.  And I guess everybody was excited and based on it 'cause back then I guess you know people considered you smart when you were in computers and my mother [Lillian Gore] and father [George Gore, Sr.] were just bragging on it, on my god, he's going to be in computers.  He's going to do this.  And you know they were more pumped up than I was, you know.  But I enjoyed it again and, and excelled pretty well in it while I was there.
Story_ID: 111873
Speaker 1: And what kinds of activities and clubs did you belong to in high school [Crossland High School, Temple Hills, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I didn't belong to any clubs in high school.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: I, when I got into high school probably 10th grade is when my, you know when my--everything kicked in cause my father had bought me a car and it was a [Ford] Granada and it was like kind of new.  So to have a car you know in 10th grade was kind of cool because you know everybody started to levitate to you.  Then I, I started building my personality more then.  So, very humorous guy, you know started to getting to girls more I guess then and girls started to notice me a little more then you know.  And just--I just got along with everybody, white, black guys, girls and we did more activities, going to parks and stuff.  All of us would get together, meeting over somebody's house, all of us get together, you know.  So we would--my--it was good watching my cousins 'cause they were into basketball heavy.  I mean like I said they were like royalty in school 'cause they played all sports, football, basketball, everything, and I liked to go to the games and it was just good to go to their games and watch them get all this attention and newspapers and all that stuff, you know.  And I can remember watching my brother, the wrestling champ you know going to his thing, sitting there because they felt like they had the athletic ability and I had the mental ability.  So you know we kind of all blended together, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.  And what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-four.
Speaker 1: And what did you do after you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school.  I worked in NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration].
Speaker 1: Okay, you worked full-time at NOAA?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they asked me, well could you carry over for the summer.  And at this time I, you know, I learned to barber early from my uncle on my mother's [Lillian Gore] side.
Story_ID: 111874
Speaker 1: How old were you when you learned to barber?
Speaker 2: I was probably like sixteen or seventeen.
Speaker 1: And did you like it?  Did you enjoy it?
Speaker 2: Well my father [George Gore Sr.] was a big fan of the barber shop so you know every week he got his hair cut or whatever and they would take--you know my father cut our hair for a long time because you know he learned that skill himself being in a military and my Uncle Caswell [ph.] it--he wasn't really my uncle and as you get older you learn that he's your cousin.  But by him being older they called him uncle back then.  He was a part-owner of Seat Pleasant Barber Shop with Mr. Harris.  So my father would come in there and they would get these stories going and I'm sitting there--I'd hang out with my father everywhere.  My father get in the car, I get in the car you know from when I was small coming up.  And he would go in there and I just admired the way the barbers, the community loved the barbers.  I mean they always had money seemed like it, they had a nice car, Cadillacs or whatever.  And you know you kind of got even more hipper cause you could see that inner male conversation going back and forth.
Speaker 1: And was the barber shop like the place to hang out?
Speaker 2: Man, everybody you know was at the bar--Seat Pleasant Barber Shop was huge, you know, 'cause you only had one or two and everybody came there in the neighborhood and it was most--it was all men.  So they're talking trash and all that stuff and I can remember my father telling my uncle about the story about them and he always egg him till this day.  He's like seventy, like ask your father what happened to that baby.  So he was telling him this baby was born and jumped out the window or something and bounced back up.  And it was this big you know joke so every time I would see my uncle he would say, ask your father what happened to that baby you know, that came out talking and all that stuff.  But they had great stories there and the fishing was big.  We fished a lot when we came up.  So that was a major conversation, fishing.  And I can remember my Uncle Caswell talking to me about barbering a little bit, you know.  And just you know, bought some clippers and started working with him.  He was showing me a lot of stuff--
Story_ID: 111875
Speaker 1: Did you have, did you feel like you had like a natural ability and a natural knack for it or was it kind of hard for you to learn?
Speaker 2: It was both you know.  The--it was a funny story because when I got out of high school (unclear) and I got to tell you this cause this is too funny to me.  I'm thinking about when you said high school.  You know our prom, you know it had the yearbook so I was in the year book for, you know I had my picture in the yearbook.  I had like four pictures in the yearbook.  I don't know how they shot me but it was cool to have them in the yearbook.  But you know you get your prom tickets right?  And this was big.  This was different from the baby prom, this is the big prom.  And I can remember they come up with this scheme to sell cookies for free tickets and this is how bad we were at this time.  The girls sold the cookies and got the tickets so we didn't even pay to go to the prom.  We had free, two tickets all--me, Tony, Kenny (Unclear) and all of us hung together.  And our group made us cool because we wasn't thugs and we wasn't athletes, but you know we got along well, we explored life.  So here we are going to the prom and I can remember picking my date, Rachelle Marshall [ph.] who was my girlfriend in twelfth grade.  She was tough, you know what I mean?  This girl Cheryl Smith wrote in my yearbook something real nice.  She caught up to her like around 1 o'clock that day you know cause they're reading the books.  You know how everybody signing your books and stuff.  And a couple of girls wrote some real nice--and she caught them that day and let them know, don't do it.  So I can remember going to the prom, I'm picking her up.  Cheryl and them scared to death of her you know and they had this before party that Friday we went to.  So I had a car and Jackie Walls called me and said I don't have a ride to the party.  And Tracy Green was giving this party.  I said you can ride with me if you want to.  So I picked her up about eight, we got to the party over Tracy Green's house.  You know back then your mother [Lillian Gore] was there so they was in the kitchen having a card thing and you'd be in the basement partying.  And we walked through and when I get to the thing I can remember Tracy Green coming up to me saying, you know Rachelle in there.  I said yeah I'm supposed to be meeting her here.  So I picked you know Jackie up 'cause she didn't have a ride.  They don't see it that way.  Jackie need to leave.  I said well she can't leave, you know.  Y'all over exaggerating.  Let's just go in the party.  We get in the party, Jackie went her way, I went down the steps to see where Rachelle was at.  Somehow she got up the steps past me and she upstairs dealing with Jackie.  And I'm saying to myself, this is you know, this girl tough.  You know when we grew up she could whoop boys but she was sexy and cute.  So to skip past that part we get to the prom.  Well we didn't get to the prom.  I pick her up at her house the night for the prom all dressed up had my white on.  We had white and red on.  And I can remember her mother gave me this long lecture about being home at 11 o'clock, no drinking, all this stuff.  And back then you know, you was just like (shaking head yes).  So she, she you know--I pinned her in the foyer area you know put the pin on her and stuff, the carnation.  My car was immaculate.  I mean I'm a--I keep my clean anyway.  This--I waxed my car every day.  It was immaculate.  We get out, she got a white dress on, I got white and red on, we looked perfect.  We're going down the street.  Here is Tracy Harris on the corner in her prom dress waving us down.  And I'm saying to myself, I wonder what she's waving us down for and Ray is telling me to pull over.  So I pull over, I roll my window down.  I said what's up Tracy?  She said, oh hi Ray, hi Roger, and they start talking, which I, I mean I'm cool.  We're not late.  We, we're early and this thing comes out Tracy's mouth.  Can I get a ride with ya'll down to the prom?  And I'm looking over at Rachelle like--(shaking head no).  And she was like (shaking head yes)--yeah, come on Tracy.  So went right past me.  So I'm cool, Tracy hops in.  Now you know a [Ford] Granada, two bucket seats in the front, long seat in the back.  I done made a tape the whole night, Teddy Pendergrass on it, Isley Brothers you know cause I want this to be a great night.  I got my tape in, I pop it in, Tracy leans up on the seat.  Rachelle is here, I'm here, Tracy's head is right here.  And I'm saying to myself, it's bad enough you're riding with us.  You could at least lay back and let us enjoy some of the prom.  So it was not until later, two years later I used to--you know I bumped into Rachelle.  I said, did y'all plan that on me?  She said yeah, she called me like an hour before and said her date stood her up, could she ride down with her.  'Cause she made it seem like it was a surprise.  I couldn't say no to her.  And I'm saying, oh that's cold.  But I tease Tracy till this day when I see her for messing my prom up, my third wheel.
Story_ID: 111876
Speaker 1: So after you graduated from high school you went to work at NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration].
Speaker 2: Yep, went to work at NOAA.
Speaker 1: And how long did you stay at NOAA?
Speaker 2: Well I was actually on a layover because I got accepted to Frostburg [State] University [Frostburg, Maryland] and you know scholarship, whatever, they was going to pay for it and stuff.   And I can remember working at NOAA through the summer.  Roosevelt Roach, they called him Roach was my mentor, him and Kathy were my mentors at the NOAA and they were just like so--like I said I had always been blessed to have people work with me.  And they were kind of showing me the ropes.  You know Kathy (Unclear) was just like, well I'm going to show you how to work in F and I--F8 upstairs and I'm like--they were showing me how to develop film, you know cause that was big cause you know NOAA dealt with the maps and stuff.  And I can remember them saying hey, you probably could work here 'cause you're good, you know.  And the--Mr. Song who was the person that ran NOAA fell in love with me, you know, had sent me through all these little programs that you can go through which is free to learn different stuff.  And I was saying, well I'm going to Frostburg so I'm probably not going to be able to work here but you know when I come back in the summers can I work here?  They was like, sure.  And I remember driving to Frostburg for their orientation and you know, I can remember going to this little--I mean Frostburg is in the mountains.
Speaker 1: Right, so we're talking about Frostburg State University--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Western Maryland.
Speaker 2: It's in the mountains and you know back then it was hick town.  And I didn't stay there more than an hour, was out of there (unclear) cause I'm saying, I can't go here.  This is--I'm liable to get hung up here, you know.  And at that time you know I came into myself a little bit so I came home, my mother [Lillian Gore] was very disappointed.  I mean you know back then it's different.  You're physically disappointing, you know.  Every time she could think, she wanted to choke me.  You know you're blowing this thing.  What you talking about doing?  And at this point now I guess I'm thinking about what am I going to do with my life.  Here, I done had it easy all these years, flowing through school you know, got the highest final exam in English, you know.  And now I get to a point where I really got to decide, well what are you going to do?  And looking at computers back then was different because you know they wore hush puppies, they was real--you know had the pocket pin thing.  I knew I didn't want to do that.  Even though I was good, I don't want to do it.  And my mother was really pressuring me on what--you got to do something.  So my father [George Gore, Sr.] comes along with the real conversation you know.  You know in a couple of years you got to be out of here anyway so you need to figure out what's going to happen.  So the first thing I thought was I'm going to the military, you know.  Went down to take the [U.S.] Air Force thing, scored nicely in the air force.  So they was going to hook me up with this nice job, you know, apply for the officer's thing.  So I'm, you know, my recruiter takes about four of us down to Baltimore [Maryland] to be sworn in.  Now you got to remember my father is thirty years in the military and real heavy with the military.  Somehow it gets back to him that your son is being sworn in, in Baltimore.  He leaves his job and next thing I remember the, the guy saying the oath you know, raise your hand, next thing I know he stops the oath and they call my name out.  Roger Gore, step forward.  I'm saying dag, you know I'm thinking he was--you know, you don't know what's going to happen.  Is something big getting ready to happen to me or what?  I step forward.  Get out of line.  Walk with this gentleman here.  So this guy comes up, officer came up and got me, took me into his room and sat me down.  And I'm saying dag, wonder what's up.  And I'm sitting in this room for like thirty minutes and then finally he comes up and says, come with me and walked me outside.  When we walked me outside he said good day.  And I'm saying, good day?  What happened?  So never saw the recruiter again.  Here my father pull up, get in the car.  I get in the car.  I said what happened?  He said you didn't tell nobody you was going to the military.  I said well you told me I had these choices so I figured air force won't be bad.  I can fly jets or something.  He was like you ain't going in the military.  You ain't throwing your life away with the military.  So he had talked to one of the--he was tight with one of the lieutenants in there and they had pulled me and pulled all my stuff, shredded all my stuff, everything.  And I get back home and I'm one week in limbo.
Story_ID: 111877
Speaker 1: And I remember going to get my hair cut and talked to my uncle and my uncle said, why don't you try barbering school.  Or you know--and then we kept talking about it and then he finally said you know something would be better--cause you know I barbered but I always thought to myself, if I did hair I'd probably make more money.  So why don't you do hair?  You know I can still do most of the barbering and you can do the hair on your own.  And I went to Robert Lewis, all-white school in Silver Springs [Silver Spring, Maryland] and I applied for the grant.  So I got a free grant.  Back then hair school was only eight hundred--well, yeah 800 dollars and your kit was 200 dollars.  So they gave me 1,200 dollars, so I didn't even have to pay for my school.  But when I got home and told my mother [Lillian Gore] that I joined, I went to high--you know to get into the beauty school, my mother went crazy.  I mean I just--this was like worse than sickle cell.  This was days of torture for me.  Every day she think she's see me, I'm sitting there eating cereal, she'd look at me and crank the conversation up, you know.  And she's in constant contact with the counselor from the school 'cause they behind my back are trying to ease me back into the realm of school.  And she bringing up like, well I talked to the counselor and he was saying you know you can still come up there.  I'm like I don't want to go up there.  Well why don't we look at another school?  I'm just figuring out I don't want to go to school.  And she's like well your grades are so good.  You got all these offers from college.  So now it's to the point where I'm not making the decision on my own to go her way, she feels like she's going to intervene now.  So you know while you're going to beauty school it's all day.  So--and I'm in beauty school with a nightmare.  I'm not getting anything, you know.  And back then they do re-evaluate you after like six weeks and I could remember my re-evaluation.  And Judy who was the director of the school had me, set me down, was like (shaking head no)--we just don't see it.  You know you got Lincoln Tech, you know I heard you did good in school.  Maybe you'll do--I talked to your mother, you might want to go to college.  You don't have the knack to do hair.  You are--I mean I was terrible.  I couldn't do nothing.  And it seemed like I would sit in that class and I'm book oriented, and I'm not catching any of this.  And I'm saying--they just started talking over my head.  So I never told my mother about it and they can't kick you out the school, they can just re-evaluate you and what happens is they kind of contact you and they work with your loan and try to get you in another school.  And I told her, I said no, I want to hang, you know cause now I'm thinking I go back to my mother, she's going to think she's right and I'm in trouble.  So it was so funny that my mother one day came in with the final conversation. Three months in school, I ain't looking no better, you know.  My uncle done abandoned me kind of.  He's like well maybe you need to go to school and my mother's at this point telling me that Friday, you're going to school on Monday.  Not the, the beauty school thing, the real school.  And I'm saying to myself, nah, you know I don't want to go.  And she's--you know back then you didn't talk back so I'm just listening.  My mother was so mad at me listening and I'm--you know, my room was at the top of the steps and the door and the steps was near each other.  And my dresser was by the door.  My mannequin head is there, my case, my rollers, everything is right there.  My mother was very strong.  My mother threw all of that stuff down the steps and then when she looked back at me, she said you're going to school on Monday and closed the door.  I'm sitting there, don't know what to do.  I'm 18--you know I'm 17, had a great life, now I'm at this crossroad and I can remember praying that, you know that's the first time I probably ever prayed on my own without a ceremony like dinner or something like that. And I think I prayed that whole night you know and I cried a little bit about it cause I didn't--I never wanted to disappoint my mother and father [George Gore Sr.].  So I'm sitting there praying, praying, just asking God, you know show me something cause I don't want to make a bad decision and now they're starting to beat up on me.  I'm about to go back to school.  So I can remember that whole weekend just being a silent weekend.  My mother wasn't speaking to me.  My father was cool, he just you know hanging in the corner about it.  And Monday I went to beauty school and it was a different--I could feel it, you know a difference in school that day for some reason because we had--we were doing pin curls what I hate.  I couldn't do none of the stuff anyway.  Now I'm going to do something I really hate 'cause I really couldn't get the pin curl thing. And I'm doing the pin curls and Judy came over to me after about four things, we did the pin curls, the brick lay and all that and she was like, you can't be the same person from Friday till today.  I mean my pin curls was in line and it was just--it came through my hands that I was getting it, how to you know to pin them, the roller blades, how to lock the--you know it just was running through my mind now at a point.  And I can remember her saying, she's getting the others instructors, look at him.  Did y'all do something with him Friday?  'Cause I mean I was terrible.
Story_ID: 111878
Speaker 1: And so how long were you--how long did it take you to complete beauty school at Robert Lewis [Beauty School, Silver Spring, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Like a year.  You know it was a year course back then.
Speaker 1: So you finished in 1986?
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987]?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the beginning of eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 1: And so after you completed beauty school, what did you do next?  Did you easily get a job in a hair salon or--?
Speaker 2: No, because you know what's funny when I--you know, I think and I get spiritual about that because this is probably the rest of my life at this point.  What I prayed for that night was lay my direction, you know what am I going to do?  And I think when you pray you're praying for that thing in the front and he's thinking the whole thing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because six months into beauty school, I entered this hair competition and nobody wanted to enter it cause I entered in Atlanta [Georgia] at the Bronner Bros. [International Beauty] Show and won first place.  So the hairdressers started looking at me and I won like four more competitions after that.  There was a big show expo I won twice like that and I can remember meeting Barry Fletcher then.
Speaker 1: And who's Barry Fletcher?
Speaker 2: Barry was like this big hair dresser back then.  He won a Rolls Royce doing hair and he was from my neighborhood.  And nobody had won a Rolls Royce doing hair before so he had to be bad to win a Rolls.  And I can remember him telling me you know man you're pretty good you know, boom, boom, boom, at the competition.  So when I graduated I went to my uncle and like, well what should I do now? I've graduated.  He said that guy Barry just opened up a salon about a year ago.  Why don't you see if you can work for him?  And before I did that I went around to some other shops.  And back then you only had, I mean it was no way to get in.
Story_ID: 111879
Speaker 1: And what was it like for a man who was a hairstylist back then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I went to school, I had a unique class because we had like four straight guys and like four gay guys.  And we all interacted you know cause I--it's not--I was never been my--I just wasn't raised to look down on somebody.  So we kicked it and back then you still didn't get the realism of what gay was, you know.  So you didn't think anything sexual or physical you just--them guys kind of funny but they was cool and we became good friends all of us.  And when I got into the beauty business the gay guys had the jobs, you know and when you go to a salon you know you start off as a shampoo person and everywhere I went it's like they would pull out a stack of applications like this, we're not looking right now.  I mean you're just knocked all of George Avenue, 8th Street, back on our side, you know Bowie--well not Bowie but like Catwell Heights, all that.  And I'm tired.  My mother [Lillian Gore] threw with me anyway.  So I turn around and my uncle said, go see Barry, see what he'll do.  And I went to his shop, man his place was gold in a gold house, had the Avant-Garde, his logo on his--on an ornament.  I mean his--had the Rolls Royce out front.  It was like seven or eight at night so it was dark, he was closing up.  And I remember ringing the bell, he finally opened and it was him.  And he had this glass counter for a reception area and he's sitting behind it on the phone.  He had a cordless phone and I'd never seen a phone cordless in my life and he was like, how can I help you little man?  I said, yeah I met you at the show.  You was telling me you know I was good and I was--you know I'm looking for a job man.  I've been everywhere, ain't nobody hiring.  He said we ain't hiring here either you know right now and he showed me his stack of applications of people that done applied.  And he was doing a show, a hair show.  You know he did hair shows himself where he showed new styles and stuff like that and they sold tickets for.  And he was like you know, you seem kind of determined cause I wouldn't give--I was just standing there.  He looking, I'm looking and he talking, I'm talking.  And he said, tell you what, I like you.  If you sell twenty tickets to this show you'll get a job here.  So he gave me a stack of tickets and I think I may have sold them tickets in about two days.  But I sold it cause I got my mother first.  I said if you buy ten tickets from me, I'm ten more tickets a way, I can get a job.  She bought ten tickets off the back.  I sold the rest so I come back the, that Tuesday with all the tickets sold.  He said you sold them tickets in two days?  I said, well you know, I'm pretty bad.  And I started that day at the shampoo bowl.
Speaker 1: And so let's talk a little bit about--so during this time tell us a little bit about what, like the hair industry was like and did you have to kind of grapple a lot with you know having to defend your straightness or did it not matter to people as long as you did a good job?
Speaker 2: Well I mean, I grew up in the neighborhood Holly Park [Seat Pleasant, Maryland).  It was a tough neighborhood so going to beauty school immediately, even though you grew up with everybody now they're starting to question what direction you're taking.  So you know it got so bad that my boys came to me, you know Tony Proctor, I grew up with all them was like (makes mean staring face).  You know I ain't trying to disrespect you or nothing but "the fellas" (makes quote signs with hands) was just wondering you know did you (makes dive gesture with hands)?  I'm like nah, what ya'll talking about?  But I, I really got into the industry so when I realized I was good, I mean I was in beauty school putting on hair competitions myself.  I wasn't even out of school yet.  So you know I think God just had bestowed this beautiful gift on me and my future.  So I wasn't around my friends that much cause I'm trying to learn all I can about this beauty business.  So I'm hanging with Barry, you know you're wearing different kind of clothes in the beauty industry.  So you know that's--you know they questioned it like you know we don't see you no more.  This guy pick you up in his Rolls Royce--
Speaker 1: You wearing these different kind of clothes.
Speaker 2: They telling me he gay.  You ain't gay is you?  And I'm like, nah I ain't gay, just doing what I'm doing.  So I went years, you know till like 21 just wrapped up into the beauty business and I was absorbing it.  And you know it was unique that I could watch something and learn it which I couldn't do at first.  You know I was going reading and all that but I could watch you cut a head of hair and I could do it.
Speaker 1: And were you starting to develop your own clientele and your own--
Speaker 2: No, because you worked as a shampoo person for years in the beauty business back then you know.  And they didn't let you loose like that.  You know you had to prove yourself.  So I had worked in a curl shop cause Barry and them they do curls so the curl shop was Studio 704.
Speaker 1: And what's a curl shop?
Speaker 2: Where do all curls at, Jerry Curls and Cho was the curl queen.  She has a 38 dollar curl.  She would do ten people an hour.  And the guy I worked with at Avant Garde Hair Gallery, Richard H., who was a hairdresser, his mother owned the shop and that's how I got the job there.  She needed an assistant for the weekends.  I worked there Sunday and Monday 'cause we was closed Sunday and Monday.  And that was boot camp, you know.  She would just immediately do a contrast.  I know you up there with the rich boy.  Down here, this is where you work at.
Story_ID: 111880
Speaker 1: So Mr. Gore, you're working at the curl shop.
Speaker 2: (No audible response.  Shaking head yes.)
Speaker 1: And like you said, that was boot camp so you were really learning, I mean learning a lot about the industry and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: From the bottom to the top.  You know, more procedures at Avant-Garde.  Here, you wipe the stations down when you finish working, you ate for 10 minutes, you know and she was just so strenuous on your time.  You know you could only eat for five minutes.  She would just knock on the door, come on out of there.
Speaker 1: And so this was in 1987.  And tell us a little about, a little bit about in 1990, The Hair Gangsters.  Tell us about who they were and what that was about.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we sat around the--you know in the '80s [1980s], let me tell you what was funny about the '80s [1980s].  We didn't have real big clienteles.  I mean Barry [Fletcher], did because he was a celebrity stylist.  We were building our clienteles.  Well what happened was in the'80s [1980s], I don't know if you remember, you know you got straight stylists and you got gay stylists.  AIDS hit. AIDS terrified the whole community so a lot of clients jumped from the gay stylists to the straight stylists thinking they--you know the husband's requests, leave him alone.  Sign somebody else.  And they always felt like men could do their hair better or could cut their hair better.  So our clienteles increased overnight you know and you know that just made us you know bigger than who we really was at that time 'cause our reputation grew.  So we're sitting around saying dag, this is a marketing tool.  So we had put these, you know we wore suits to work.  And--
Speaker 1: You did hair in suits?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did hair in suits.  I mean Avant Garde [Hair Gallery] was a real, real high clientele so we worked in suits and ties, everything.  And we took a picture one night because Barry came up with a concept, why don't we--you know he already taught by himself but what if he you know invited us to teach with him cause we always did the work behind the scenes.  And when we took the picture we looked at it.  Me and him was sitting in his office cause I'd hang up there all times of the night.  And I said man, we look like some gangsters and that's when we started talking about Hair Gangsters.  And then we formed a team, The Hair Gangsters.  That's the--Richard who was an original stylist at Avant Garde had left at that time so I was the only original left.  And then Larry Masterberg [ph.] had came there and Antoine Dorrell [ph.] came from Cleveland.  And they--we formed The Hair Gangsters.
Speaker 1: And so you all would travel all over the country teaching--?
Speaker 2: Teaching hair cutting techniques, Vidal Sassoon systematic approach to hair cutting, coloring techniques, motivation on how to build your clienteles.  We actually shot Dudley Products' first hair video.
Speaker 1: And who is Dudley in relation to the hair industry?
Speaker 2: Dudley is one of the original greats in the beauty business.  Again, blessed career because I was able to meet Joe Dudley [African American business and hair care entrepreneur High Pointe, North Carolina], become great friends with him, Nathaniel Brown who owns Bronner Bros. [African American hair and skin producers, Marietta, Georgia], which is a big company, become good friends with him.  So all the greats I've met because of my career and become great friends with them.  And for them that are still alive to see me now, they knew that I came from the ground up, you know.
Story_ID: 111881
Speaker 1: And so let's talk about in 1992, you organized a cosmetologist and barber association.  Tell us why you felt the need to do that and what the association did?
Speaker 2: Well as I found my niche in the industry as far as making a change, making it better, I knew as hairdressers you know we're on something called commission and we were employees of the shop.  And then they stretched from that to something called booth rent where you were actually your own contractor so we never had benefits like medical, dental, things that other industries had.  And no one ever addressed it.  So I said well it's a chance to make a difference and I got real tight with the Mayor of [Washington] D.C. and the credit union--
Speaker 1: Who was the mayor then, [HM] Marion Berry?
Speaker 2: Marion Berry, yeah.  And I got real tight with Mel Calloway out of California who owned one bottle company and he was the one that like said, yeah go for it.  So I got in contact with a credit union lead and they told me a way that we could create a credit union, (unclear) for the credit union and we had speakers come down, talk about financial.  We got hooked up with a disability company, Midland Insurance Company for retirement so we formed an association, United Association of Cosmetological Entrepreneurs.
Story_ID: 111882
Speaker 1: And so, at the ripe old age of twenty-eight, you decide to leave doing hair on a regular basis and move more into the business industry of things and develop your own product line.
Speaker 2: (No audible response,  Shaking head yes)
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about, tell us the name of the product line, what you sold and how that all came about?
Speaker 2: It's called G'Natural Herbal Products and it came about from Mel Calloway who had became one of my mentors in the beauty business.  Also Larry [McLenney] that owns Kemi Oyl became one of my mentors because I created a cosmetology trade show in D.C., and to get all the manufacturers here.  And from there they were saying you know you got the mind to be more into hairdressing.  So why--you know become more in the hairdressing.  And Mel Calloway was the first one that said create a product.  I can't tell you what, I can't tell you why.  Create a product line.  And I liked natural products so I decided to come up with something natural.  And at the time they had a company out called Natural Oasis which sold a hair and scalp conditioner.  And I went to work for them for--as an independent distributor 'cause I sold beauty supplies, had my own van and everything under the Association.  And they were like a poorly operated company and I said to myself, well this can be built upon and I created my own hair and scalp conditioner, herbal.
Speaker 1: Like how did you create it?  Did you work with scientists and to create it?
Speaker 2: Shaking head yes.  Agina Shabazz [ph.] out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], again a great friend of mine, I've met some great people in my life.  She had her own product line.   She said, I know a chemist that can help you and she turned me on to a chemist.  So when I worked with that chemist they gave me strict instructions.  You have to know ingredients.  So spend all your time learning ingredients and we can help you.  But if you don't know nothing then you can't help us.  So I learned ingredients, herbal ingredients and Agina [Shabazz] gave me books on herbs and stuff like that and how they go together.
Speaker 1: And what made your product, your conditioner different from other things that were on the market?
Speaker 2: Well most conditioners were petroleum-based.  Ours were vegetable oil based for one.  Number two, the choices and selection of herbs.  The company that I was in direct competition with only listed like vegetable oil and herbs.  So you never know what herbs are in there.  As I read more and worked with Agina and her enlightening me on what herbs did, I selected the most expensive healing herbs for hair and scalp.  So it was like Rosemary, Sage, (unclear), Comfrey, Calendula and I put those things in a product.  And we had to get the base right, the texture of it because we didn't want our product to set on top or clog the pores and we got the base right and we put it out in the street.  It was successful overnight.
Speaker 1: And how did you market it, I mean in order to, for it to obtain its success?
Speaker 2: Well I was blessed because I was a good--I won't say a great hairdresser.  I was a good hairdresser.
Speaker 1: So your reputation helped you?
Speaker 2: Right, cause I had already been all over the country teaching.  I won competitions and hair competitions so I was already known so it was easy for me to go back into it with hairdressers and ask them to try my product.
Story_ID: 111883
Speaker 1: And when did you start--excuse me--becoming concerned about African Americans really needing to repair their hair and that kind of thing?  When did you start becoming concerned about that?
Speaker 2: Larry [McClenney] that owned Kemi Oyl had mentioned to me one day, again, blessed to have somebody in my life, he said concentrate on the consumer.  You know it's great to be about the profession but concentrate on what the consumer needs and you'll have your market.  And what I noticed was that the relaxer companies or the chemical company, hair was becoming more and more damaged in the African American community.  I saw it while I was a hairdresser. And I'm saying well that's going to be my niche, repair and maintenance.  Then that way I don't have to deal with any chemicals.  I don't have to speak with a fork tongue.  I can stay focused on one thing.
Speaker 1: So with G'Natural [Herbal Products], you created the first two products and then went on to create other products.  Tell us some of the other products that you created as well.
Speaker 2: Well we created the hair and scalp conditioner.  We have vitamins.  We created Get it G, which is a shaving product so after you shave it reduces razor bumps, inflammation, bumps on the back of your neck, things like that.  So we just went down the line, shampoo, conditioners, so we wanted to stay consumer-oriented.
Story_ID: 111884
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little bit about your book, your first book that you published called 'No More Weave Please.'
Speaker 2: I caught it on that book.  But you know I, I'd always been against hairdressers or stylists that didn't understand hair maintenance.  And when, normally, when you get a weave and your hair is damaged, it makes it worse.  But people have been doing weaves for the money more than for the condition of the hair.
Speaker 1: And when did weaves start to become really big?
Speaker 2: This was like Janet Jackson [African American singer, songwriter, actress], all them with the individuals.  You know they--but they don't understand, Janet got it put in, Janet got it took out.  We got it put in and kept it in.  So Janet made it popular you know, and that was some of the first cuts.  So the weave took off in the community because it gave women their look you know immediately.  They didn't have to grow their hair, nothing.  They just immediately get the look.
Speaker 1: But the weave can do a lot of damage to the hair too.
Speaker 2: Oh punish you, yeah.  I mean they came out with the glue.  Everything started getting a--you know it was like a microwave generation kicked in.  While we had to learn the grind from the shampoo all out, these guys came out of beauty school and went right to the chair.  So the manufacturer had to cheat and make things easier for them.  So they went from braiding and sewing it in to you can use glue.  Demise!  So now they're just gluing it in and snatching it out.  So I said again, nobody's saying anything so I'm going to say something.  I, I got the right.  You know I'm pretty big in the industry.  So I said let me call it what it is.  No more weave please!  The hairdressers went off.  I'm getting calls on love and I'm getting calls on hate.  And the title was 'No More Weave, Please' because it's saying the customer is begging you, no more weave please, repair my hair.  And then I don't care what you do after that.  You can put the weave back in but repair my hair first.  That's why we said no more weave please.
Speaker 1: And how did it resonate among customers and consumers?
Speaker 2: The consumers loved the book.  I mean that's why that book (unclear) so well.
Speaker 1: Cause it was educational for them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was educational for them.  And then the hairdressers started piling on because the more they got enlightened and they couldn't admit to the wrongdoing so they might as well pile on with it.  Yeah, he's right.  You know you don't want to weave over-damaged hair.  So I thought that was kind of cool that everybody kind of towards the end liked the book.  And Barry [Fletcher] who was my, one of my original people I worked for caught up to me and gave me a compliment to say you know something, you always been the kind of person that will take a fight on and--
Speaker 1: And in actuality it's more profitable for the hairstylist to repair the damaged hair opposed to just you know putting the weave in there, correct?
Speaker 2: I would think so and I thought they would get the hang of that.  But you know I can't educate you, teach you and lead you.  So they are learning now that it's more important to repair the hair first.
Speaker 1: But it seems as if you know we are still surrounded by weaves.  I mean are hairdressers repairing hair first or in--or do you think that they're really denying it, people who are saying, no, I really want that weave?
Speaker 2: Well you know as long as it's--anything you make popular precedes health.  So the weave became popular 'cause celebrities wore it, Lil Kim, Mary J. Blige.  You can go down the list.  But you take that hair off and if they got four strands up there, they're doing good.  But this gives you the--like when Michael Jordan shaved his head, guys were trying to get their hair back until Michael Jordan shaved.  When he shaved the head, they was like, I'm out and then they started shaving.  So anytime a celebrity touches it, it puts a new spin on it.  But it's supposed to be our position to balance the spin with health.  So yeah it's popular so we'll do it.  But at the same time we'll back it up with some health care.  But we didn't do that, you know.  We just went through it.
Story_ID: 111885
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about your second book that you published this year called 'Hair Gangster.'
Speaker 2: 'Hair Gangster' was my--men with the industry, it was my hug for them.  I'm making up to them now after I smacked them with the other book.  So in my travels with my speaking and stuff, a lot of hairdressers come up to me and say you know--cause now I'm starting to get all these awards now.  And so they came up to me saying well how did you do it?  Well what did you do?  So I said well let me just do a book to help them.  And the reason I used the term hair gangster because you know that came from us as being aggressive hairdressers.  We marketed ourselves, our appearance.  You know we kind of rose above you know just a regular hairdresser to try to excel in the industry all the way to being a manufacturer.  So if you want to be a hair gangster this is how you do it and it says work in the beauty game.  So we just go step by step telling them how to get their self from point A, point C and show them how the business is broke down from manufacturing, distribution on down to beauty schools, beauty supply stores and salons.
Speaker 1: And do you think that Barry Fletcher was somewhat on the cutting edge as well with his salon you know being--
Speaker 2: (No audible response, shaking head yes)
Speaker 1: --you know just top notch and extremely professional?  Because unfortunately a lot of salons--well some salons in the black community that air of professionalism and that top notch is, sometimes isn't there.  So do you think he was kind of on the cutting edge as well?
Speaker 2: Actually he was not.  In that time, all salons were that way so that's the difference.  Today he would be on the cutting edge because you know you have a different style of shop ownership.  But back then all of them were ran professionally.  You had an expectation of the stylist, you know.  I remember Cho used to say when you come in there and you wasn't dressed properly, this is the beauty shop, not the body shop.  And you had to go home that day and change up and come back.  If you decided not to come back, you was fired.  You came back, all right, go back to work.  So they didn't hold anything personal with you.  They just felt like they was instructing you on how to perform in the beauty industry.  Now it's, it's more liberal you know it's more loosely ran.  And I think the hairdressers now are reaching out for how can we get back to the old, you know that glory day of being respected, being professional.  And I'm crazy about them wanting it back you know so that's why really I did the book too cause I'm saying again, here is something that can help you guys get back on track with what you want to do.  And we got some great stylists out here.  So if they get the rest of it, it's over.
Story_ID: 111886
Speaker 1: And well how do you think the industry has changed for men also?
Speaker 2: You know the male hairdressers almost disappeared from when I was coming up.  You know you had you know--our relationships were so stronger then.  There was no gay or straight, no--you know it was a hairdresser.  You didn't see anybody sexually.  So we were one big family and we admired our accomplishments so if you did something great it like represented all of us.  And the male hairdresser had big respect because they always said we cut better. And when you're a barber first, becoming a hairdresser, you learn to cut from the scalp out so you are stronger.  Then a point came where the industry died because of the way it was ran.  It was no longer commission based, no longer ownership based, it was booth rent.  So with unorganization you normally don't find too many men and the, you know popularity died down.  You know we're structure oriented like army, stuff like that.  So you know it died out and I don't even see it coming back.  I don't see as many guys in school when I go around to speak to schools now, you know as it was, you know.  It's not even about straight or gay no more, it's just not as many guys, you know.  And they don't understand the power they possess, you know.  We had seventeen clients a day, twenty-four on Saturdays but women loved coming for men to do their hair.  They loved it, you know.  So I hope they get back into it.
Speaker 1: What do you think it's going to take to change it, for it to be more attractive to more men?
Speaker 2: Somebody has to have the, you know, the initiative to want to make a change, you know.  We all have our eras.  We got [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther Kings, we had our [HM] Jesse Jacksons, now we Al Sharpner [sic, HM Al Sharpton],you know [unclear]. So you have you know different times when people will rise to make a change. In our industry you had Nathaniel Bronner.  Before them you had John B. Fuller, you had Joe Dudley, Ed Gardner, [HM] George Johnson then you had Barry Fletcher, you had Thomas Hayden.  And then my generation you had myself and a couple of other people coming up to make changes.  So they have to choose their leader now to make a change for them.  I'm left behind as the last dinosaur to kind of coach them into making a change.  Don't be afraid.  You know you're not going to make everybody happy but you're going to make a change for an industry.  And I'm hoping that this book and this tour we're getting ready to do will enlighten them to want to get back to that.  I think 'Barber Shop,' the movie was a great movie that gave us the window to get back because they had the white jackets on, the guy talked about the rules.  So I think we missed that opportunity and I hope they grab it.
Story_ID: 111887
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit, your thoughts on how hairstylists have changed over the years, like all the different ones you've seen, you know the prominence of the Jheri curl and the weave.  And what do you think is next and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Hairdressers had a very--respect for themselves when I was coming up.  You know wore the best, had the best cars, made real money, very open with each other.  You couldn't sit at a table with a real hairdresser and not know the beauty business because then they would excuse you 'cause you really are in the way.  So it was up to you to really know the beauty business.  And I've been blessed to have been taught by the generations before and the reason they consider me the last dinosaur because I came from the shampoo bowl up.  So what I try to do is instruct younger hair dressers if you got two years, one mouth.  Listen more than you talk, you'll grow faster.  And when you sit down looking at the styles where we came from, the conk back in the day which the barber started then the hairdressers picked it up and they'd pick it up for relaxing the hair, then you come up to the bushes, you know we had the bush, got a nappy bush doctor and all them, Soul Train.  From there they took the bush to the curl and that was big.  And then Eddie Murphy killed that overnight with that 'Coming to America.'  He just, I mean I'm sitting at the movie theater, everybody laughing.  I'm the only one sitting next to Barry [Fletcher] saying, we're in trouble.  So that ended that era.  Blow dry and curl was big and now because of the chemical damage that we are possessing because we're choosing price over quality, a lot of women from thirty-five and up are starting to cut the relaxer out and now the lock and twist is big.  And this thing is so big we're not even watch--that's how bad our industry is right now, they're not even watching it.  I've been on top of it for like three years, four years.  This thing is going to jump because women are noticing their hair growth, no tension, now they're doing it stylish.  It's just not like the locks or dreads.  And more African American women are starting to go that direction.  I think that's going to be the future for a while.
Speaker 1: More of a natural style?
Speaker 2: More of a natural.  So I'm thinking I was ahead of that in Ninety-Six [1996], Ninety-Five [1995].  Now these people trying to catch up.  So you know God has really placed me ahead of the game when I first think of myself praying for direction, he not only laid it out in one day, he laid out the rest of my life.  And so I think I'm just going through what he's laid out for me.  So just sit there and watch the women now begging for twists.
Story_ID: 111888
Speaker 1: And you've also been--some of your success has been related to a lot of celebrities who use your product--
Speaker 2: (No audible response,  shaking head yes)
Speaker 1: --and who vouch for how well it's done you know for them, that kind of thing.  Can you tell us about some of the celebrities who use your product?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Eddie Levert from the O'Jays, all the O'Jays.  But Eddie is probably one of the most helpful.  You know you he came into the product about four years ago, five years ago and fell in love with it.  And we just connected.  Also, the Dells, Marv, Jr., Vernon, Johnny Carter, I mean all of these guys.  You know we came out with a manicure, pedicure scrub and they went crazy over it.  You know it removes all the dead skin, softens the cuticle, strengthens the nail in one shot and they just loved it.  So from this one celebrity, Gerald Levert, you know has been very helpful.  Their staff, Andy Gibson who was there, a manager, has been very instrumental in us meeting other celebrities and growing the business.  And everybody's pitching in because in a time where a lot of our black manufacturers have been sold, they see my company probably as one of the few that's the light that's left.  You know this guy is young enough--I mean I was the youngest owner at twenty-eight of a hair product company.  So they're seeing me as you know we're going to hold one at least and they're all behind pushing it and getting it out there.  We were featured in the movie '[The] Fighting Temptations' as well.
Speaker 1: The product was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was in the barber shop right there.  Eddie set the shot up so you see it like four times and I thought that was you know it was out of his love for it, you know.  But I notice that these guys that's older really respect where we're going as African Americans and they're trying to keep it going.  The younger may take it for granted a little bit but older really are saying hey man, we got to keep you guys going.  So these things they don't charge me for them.  They do them out of their heart.  Anything I need, any help, they always help me.  So I've been blessed on that level.
Story_ID: 111889
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little bit about your new product, HipHopz?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we decided to do something for the kids.  So you know as you become creative, things just come to you.  And my creativity hit like when I first in beauty school.  So this thing came to me about hip hops and I thought the name up of a product four years ago before we came up with the product.  But I just said we need to do something for kids, you know.  And this year we're launching it you know hair and scalp conditioner.
Speaker 1: Just specifically for kids?
Speaker 2: Specifically for kids you know for the styles that they wear, platting their hair, corn rolls and stuff like that because they need moisture.  They need the herbal ingredients more than anybody else because their hair is growing.  So we didn't want to force G'Natural [Herbal Products] on them which we already kind of gave an image to it.  We wanted to create an image for them.
Story_ID: 111890
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: Stands out the most to me in my life is really that things have always you know--you know it's the determination not to quit.  And it's my father [George Gore Sr.] telling me hey man, you just, you know you can't never quit on it and my mother [Lillian Gore] again instructing me--I can remember we did a parade for hairdressers and we did it on Georgia Avenue cause the mayor gave us a proclamation of cosmetology day.  And this parade was set up, we all had our whites on.  I had my convertible Camaro out there and it started to rain.  And I mean it rained. So you know some people ain't got no whole lot of strength so they was like, well it's raining so we can get out of there.  And I'm standing there and everybody's wondering what to do.  And I can remember grabbing the banner and just take off into Georgia Avenue and I'm not, I'm telling you it was amazing.  When I hit Georgia Avenue with the banner, it seemed like the rain had started moving in front of me.  It cleared up in about a thirty minute period and the police was even saying, I ain't never seen the rain move like that.  But they was getting ready to roll out like saying well it's rained out, forget this.  But I'm sitting there and they just kept putting a question on it, what we gonna do?  I'm like, well it's raining.  Well we all out there, you know they just kept--everybody hitting me.  And I'm saying to myself, let's just walk, you know it ain't gonna kill you and nobody wanted to move.  And I'm not the kind of person to scream over everybody, get out in the street.  I said let me just show by example.  I grabbed the banner and hit the street and as I hit the street it stopped raining and we walked the whole thing.  Everybody at the end at the little cookout we had sitting up talking about, I can't believe it stopped raining.  But in my mind I already knew what it really was.  You know God just, has really always had his hand around my career.  That's why I've always known I'm design--I'm, I'm destined for something bigger than what I'm doing and he's running me through it because I mean every time I hit something it's a new this or he's the first to do that.  And I think on back that you have to stick with it.
Story_ID: 111891
Speaker 1: And do you ever miss being behind the chair and actually the day to day of doing hair?  Do you ever miss that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When I go into some shops they don't realize I'm standing there just absorbing it.  They think I'm stand-- I'm standing there really just you know I miss it so I'm absorbing, watching them work.  And I watch them do the style and every now and then I slip up because somebody will turn back to me and say, oh what do you think, and I'm trying not to be saying, well it looks good to me.  No but what--it's like they want me to solve that problem and then every now and then I'll slip and I'll do it.  And I'll say well you know you might want to curl it right.  So it brings me all the way back to my career of doing hair.  And I've been a hairdresser the latter part--the first part of my career so when I became a manufacturer, a lot of people that was in the business with me had even passed away or had went on to do other things.  So a lot of new hairdressers don't even remember I did hair so it always takes somebody to remind me sometime, didn't you do hair?  And you know it's kind of cool that you know that they don't even know it.  But people that are big in the industry you know because the articles that were written on me and stuff say, oh he was a good hairdresser, you know.  So I get a kick out of that sometime.

Speaker 1: And do you think that that has helped in terms of your success because you really do know the business from both sides?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well that was the advice from Mel Calloway to me.  Mel Calloway said Roger, I'm a businessman.  He started naming everybody.  Joe Dudley is a businessman, Soft Sheen, Ed Gardner is a businessman.  You are a hairdresser.  If you ever got into the business imagine how strong you would be as a manufacturer that you don't have to ask anybody does it work, you can just try it.  And I took that into you know my heart that yeah he's right, I can just try it and know if it will work.  So that's what I do now.  Before I release any product, I'm working with it about a year myself.  So my people even don't remember I was a hairdresser so they say, you didn't ask me if it worked?  And they don't know, I didn't need to ask you, I know if it works or not.  So that's kind of cool.

Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered, Mr. Gore?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I remember a Marvin Gaye song and he had a song about Lifetime ['Once in a Lifetime'] saying you know he'd never know if he'd be remembered as a sinner or a saint, you know.  I think I have a very fruitful life and I hope somebody remember me as somebody trying to make a change and carrying on the way in the beauty business.  You know making people remember where we came from and where we got to go and what we got to do to get there.  And you can't sit in the stands, you got to get on the field and you can't be afraid to fail.  So don't be afraid of failure.  Failure just makes you stronger and I think I just learned that from my parents [Lillian and George Gore Sr.] that you got to get up and keep moving.  And when somebody say they can't, you can.  And I hope they remember me as somebody that said you know you can.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much Mr. Gore.
