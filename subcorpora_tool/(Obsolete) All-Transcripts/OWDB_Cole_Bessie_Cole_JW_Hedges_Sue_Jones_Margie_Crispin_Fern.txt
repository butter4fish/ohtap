 Kite  Jones  Lemons  Jones  Lemons  Hedges  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Well, we   ll start, just for the purposes of the cassette and to help our  transcriptionist, by letting each of you state your name, when you were born,  and where you were born, and then after everyone has done that, we can start  telling stories. So I   ll just let you start.  I was born December 5, 1911 just south of Dewey County about three miles.  It was exactly eighteen miles northwest of Custer. I was the fifth of eight  children. My name is Fern Graft Crispin.  I   m Margie Burton Jones. I was born four and a half miles south of Lenora,  Oklahoma in Dewey County. I   ve never lived outside Dewy County. I was  around in the dust bowl days, but not as much as some of these other gals    Laughter   And you were born in twenty-three?  Uh-huh, four, twenty-one, twenty-three.  You just had a birthday. Okay, ready for you. State your name so we know  who you are  laughing .   Nods   Okay, ready for you. State your name so we know who you are.  I   m Sue Hedges, and I   m the daughter of Bessie Cole. I was born at Putnam in  1943.  I   m Bessie McGettrick Cole.  When were you born?  I was born at Webb.  5  Hedges  B. Cole  J. Cole  Kite  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  J. Cole  Crispin  B. Cole  J. Cole  Crispin  Lemons  Crispin  Which is south of Lenora.  February 19, 1907.  The baby of eleven   The baby of tired parents   Laughter   The last of the bunch. And you are her son?  I   m J.W. Cole. I was born north of Putnam, 1940.  Would you say that you all grew up in a rural area or lived in a rural area?  Yes.  Well, that does make it a little easier for us to talk about things and compare  our experiences.  We probably were all born in a rural area   Laughter   So what was it like on the farm? What was a typical day? What did you have  to do when you got up in the morning?  Well, you milked cows, you brought in cows, put them in the lot, put them in  stanchions, fed hogs, slopped hogs. Fed the calves, took care of chickens,  gathered eggs.  Cooked and heated on a wood stove.  Cooked bread.  Got our own wood; went to the timber and cut our wood. Had heating stoves,  cook stoves.  Very little indoor plumbing. No electricity until forty-six.  And the sand drifted in the outhouse too   Laughing  When you went to sit  down, you got sandy. It was everywhere.  Well how did you cope with that being everywhere?  Oh, there was no electricity, and we didn   t have any sweepers, vacuums or  anything, and you   d try to sweep it out with a broom. Well, you   d get a  dustpan full, but in the mean time, in sweeping, it   d all go back up again and  then settle on the furniture and the floor. Everything was gritty. We had  cisterns, but they went dry. Then we had to have well water, and it was real  hard. It would cause   I don   t know what you called it, but there would be  rims of that stuff around it.  6  B. Cole  Crispin  Lemons  Crispin  Lemons  Crispin  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  The men went to the barn, and the women went to the chicken house for  restrooms.  We raised chickens, and we wrung their heads off. We didn   t know they were  good for us then, but I can remember we had a wire in back of our cob house.  Now do you know what a cob house is?  I don   t know what a cob house is.  Well, we raised corn. My dad lived in Texas, and his dad died young, and he  had to pick cotton. He said that if he ever had a farm, he   d never raise a bowl  of cotton. So the cobs were what the corn came off of, and they shucked the  corn and stripped it with some kind of machine, and then they threw the cobs  in the cob house, and we used those for kindling. They were real good. They  made a good warm fire for a little while. We called that the cob house. Along  the back of the cob house, we had a wire hanging up. Mother was afraid to let  us scald the chickens. We   d kill one every night for school, to take to lunch  the next day, and we   d tie the legs to the wire, and then we   d take a knife, and  we   d just skin them instead of picking them. They say now that that   s much,  much better for you. We didn   t know we were healthy then, but they say the  skin is the worst part of the chicken you can eat. We just skinned it all    Laughing   Did that chicken taste good?  Yeah  We   d fry it, and Mother would roll it and flour and fry it, and we   d take  it for lunch to school. We had one every day. We always raised a lot of fryers  and had lots of hens. We had geese. We did pick them. I hated to have to  pick them, because they   d bite you, but we   d put them down and hold them  that way, and then we   d pick them and use them for feather beds and pillows  and that kind of thing. And then we raised turkeys. They   d always go off  along the creek, so we   d have to go to the creek and hunt the turkey eggs and  nests. We had fun. There were eight of us. What one couldn   t think of. We  started to church one Sunday night, there were about fifteen of us on horses,  and we were running the horses, and one of the horses stepped in a prairie dog  hole. We used to have lots of prairie dogs. Oh, they were just thick in the  pastures, and one of the horses stepped in a prairie dog hole and broke its leg.  That stopped us going to church. We had to go back and find someone to  come and kill the horse. They didn   t have veterinarians then. You couldn   t  take it to the vet, so they had to shoot it. That was something we didn   t want  to see.  Do any of those kinds of stories sound familiar to anybody else? The plucking  chickens and ducks?  Fairly well.  What was your least favorite chore?  7  B. Cole  Hedges  B. Cole  Crispin  B. Cole  Hedges  Crispin  B. Cole  Hedges  B. Cole  Jones  B. Cole  Crispin  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  Crispin  Milking cows and feeding hogs.  Laughter   Hogs were the worst.  Yes, hogs were the worst.  Fortunately, I didn   t have to milk. I had four brothers, and they did all the  milking, and mother made us stay in the house and cook. I used to think, well  it   d be nice to get out and milk.  You   d change your mind after you got out there. You got switched in the face  with a nasty tail.  And get the milk bucket stepped in.  And it was full of cockleburs.  Yeah, I think you   d change your mind.  A little old round stool no bigger than a cup.  You would just set on this stool and go that way with both hands.  I bet Bessie can tell a lot about butchering hogs too.  Yes I could. I   ve done a lot of that, and rendering lard.  And making soap. They made soap out of the lard, the cracklings that came  out of the thing.  I   ve still got my soap recipe.  Do you still make soap?  Nope.  It   s real popular to do now. People who are all crafty want to make soap. I  don   t think you guys were being crafty.  Laughter   Not that old lye soap.  I want to know how you did laundry.  Let me tell you. We had a great big, black kettle that sat outside. It held  probably forty gallons of water. When dad built the house, he was fortunate  enough, or smart enough, that he dug the cisterns, and both of the cisterns were  on the porch, so we didn   t have to go out in the sun to get water, but we had to  carry it out from the house and fill this big old boiler. Well, we put a fire  8  Jones  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  Crispin  Hedges  B. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  Crispin  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  B. Cole  under the boiler, mother did. When it began to boil, she wouldn   t let us carry  it, because she was afraid we   d get scalded, so she put it in a washing machine.  She   d already rubbed the clothes on the rub board in a tub and had them lying  out to the side in another tub, and she put those in the washer. Well, dad had  gotten a motor, a little machine with a motor on it, and you cranked it, and  then he had a belt that went cross-ways and twisted, and he put that around the  circle of the washing machine. It had a round wheel to turn it, so we didn   t  have to turn it by hand. That would turn it, and when it got through, Mother  put them back in that pot, and we had to refill it, and she boiled them again.  Then we rinsed them in clear water, and then we rinsed them in bluing water.  Then we hung them on the line. Wash them out, wring them out, and hang  them on the line.  And they smelled good when they dried outside.  How about you? Is that the same way you did laundry?  Yeah.  Pretty similar, huh?  Monday morning was usually wash day.  Most people didn   t have a motor. They had to do it themselves.  Had a stick on it.  It was moon shaped.  What about ironing? Tell us how you would iron.  Sad irons. They were heated on the cook stove.  Flat irons.  Three of them, and you had a handle that you stuck into them. When one  would get cold, you   d go back and get the other one.  I bet you got big muscles carrying those big irons.  Yeah, yeah. You sure did.  When you were working with the animals, the hogs and the cows, did you ever  operate any of the machinery on the farm, like a tractor or anything like that?  Yes.  Yeah, we did a lot of that.  9  J. Cole  B. Cole  J. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Hedges  J. Cole  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  Jones  J. Cole  B. Cole  J. Cole  Crispin  She ran the tractor. She ran the binder.  Castrating and dehogging.  She ran the combine behind the tractor.  You were busy.  Yes, I was.  And then help Daddy cut the wood. We had a great huge old woodpile just  west of the house. I   ve seen mom and dad stand in front of a buzz saw and run  those posts, those big pieces of wood through.  In the wintertime, usually a Sunday evening, with a buzz saw. All of the fence  material was made out of oak and walnut split, and the lemmings were brought  in for the buzz saw, and that was made into wood, which was heated and  cooked with during the winter.  We   ve still got lots of post logs. We tore them down and put in iron posts.  Well I can tell from the way you   re talking that you were all pretty busy, but I  can   t help but think that you had time to have some fun once in a while. So  what did you do that was fun?  By golly, I don   t know if I ever had any fun or not.  Laughter   Just setting down and not working was fun.  A few minutes to sit down, huh.  Saturday evening was in town, and usually Saturday night there was a dance  somewhere.  That   s usually what we always went to, was a dance.  I doubt that any of us in here hasn   t danced some.  My grandmother was raised on a plantation in Kentucky, and during the Civil  War her dad sent her to Texas. The northern troops were getting closer, and  they killed her parents and burned the plantation. She never would go back,  but she lived at St. Joe, and when she came to Oklahoma, she wouldn   t come  and live in a dugout. Her oldest son came, Uncle Dick Graft came in 1892 and  he and one of the men lived in the dugout, and he bought a relinquishment. A  relinquishment is where someone had settled on the place that he wanted, and  he offered to buy it. This man had been to the South Canadian River, which  was about eight miles, and he cut cedar logs this big, and he notched them and  had them ready to build a log house. They took the money; the wife said,     Take it  Take it  I   m tired of this country. Let   s go     So they took the  money, and Uncle Dick moved on the place, and he and his nephew built this  10  Lemons  Crispin  J. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  Jones  J. Cole  two-room, cedar, log house. Well, cedar bees would go into it, and on Sunday  afternoon all of the neighbors would go up and see grandma and Uncle Dick,  and those cedar bees didn   t sting, and we   d get shingles and a bacon powder  can, and we   d see who could knock down the most of those bees and put in the  bacon powder can and who got the most.  Laughter  Those cedar bees, they  got so bad that finally they practically ate that building up, and my brother  lived there with Uncle Dick and took care of him during the last. He never did  marry. He stayed with grandma. He tore the old thing down and made it into  fence posts, but we had lots of fun knocking down the cedar bees and eating  hackberries. Did you ever eat any hackberries?  No I haven   t. I have gooseberries and some mulberries, but never any  hackberries.  Yeah, we had mulberries too, but hackberries were real tiny, and they had a  great big seed in them. All you had was just the hull.  Mulberries and sugar was a Sunday dessert.  Yeah? What else would be a real treat food, something you   d have on a  special occasion or if you were really good that day?  Currants were always picked, and plumbs were made into jellies.  What did you like?  Oh, I don   t know. I try to put all those times back behind me.  We found talking to people that whenever they talked about things that they ate  a lot of, whether it was fried chicken or beans or potatoes or whatever, either  to this day, they really, really like it or they really, really hate it. So is there  anything that you had that you just can   t stand now?  A lot of it, you had to eat it whether you wanted to or not, and that was mush  and milk and cornbread and milk.  Do you like that now or is that something you say,    No way, I   m not eating  that again   ?  Yes, I like it now. I like my mush, and I still make it and fry it. I like it fried.  How about you? What   s your favorite thing?  Oh, I really don   t know. I still like the same things. We had to eat everything.  I mean we weren   t picky like kids are today.  A lot of your evening meals were a bowl of mush  all agree , and then come  morning, it was fried mush.  11  Crispin  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  B. Cole  Crispin  Kite  Crispin  We had biscuits for breakfast every morning   I imagine most of you did   and  Mother would make the biscuits, and then three times a week, since there were  eight of us, we had to make light bread, and Dad would work the light bread,  and then mother would put it in a big pot when the biscuits got done and the  bacon and stuff that we were having. My brother about got into real trouble  with his mama one time. He wanted some greyhounds, and so dad told him,  okay, he could have some, so he bought a couple of greyhounds, and he called  them Jack and Dave. So one day we looked over in there, and my mother said,     Oh my lands, the horses are running away.    Well, the hounds were chasing a  jackrabbit, and he was going along in the wagon, but the worst of that was we  always butchered hogs. We   d butcher ten or fifteen. We   d butcher for Uncle  Dick and them, and they would cure the hams and hang them up in the  washhouse. One time, those two greyhounds got in the washhouse, and they  were tied up on the rafters, and they reached up and pulled down two or three  hams. He wasn   t very popular   Does anybody else remember pets that they had around their houses?  We all had dogs.  Yeah, do you remember your dog   s name?  The dogs were of a Shepherd. They called them Shepherds. There really  weren   t any names; they were just called Shepherds, and they were used with  the cows. Everybody had milk cows to bring in twice a day. Usually they had  a Shepherd dog. A lot of people had hounds.  Usually those collie dogs were awfully good about helping to take the cattle to  another pasture, from one pasture to another. Den had one and I had one, and  one of them would go on one side of the cattle and the other on the other, and  of course we were in the back, and that   s the way we put them in the extra  pasture.  We had a collie, and we called him Rover. He   d follow the kids to school, and  we have a school picture, and he   s sitting upright with the kids in school.   Laughter   Do you still have that picture?  Yeah, I think it   s in the historical book. We made the two Dewey County  historical books. We worked three years on those. We got the first one done,  and everybody said,    Oh, make another one, we didn   t know what to write,    so  I taught English, and Woodrow wanted me to proofread all the stories. The  first ones had a lot of misspelled words, and Woodrow told me   Woodrow  Gore, he was the main one   and he said,    Try not to change the thought of the  story, but just correct the spelling.    Of course, it   d start out and they   d never  have a paragraph or anything by the time they got done, because a lot of them  didn   t have but third and fourth grade educations and could barely write and  read. Of course, in the second group, most of them had high school  12  Kite  Crispin  Kite  Crispin  Lemons  Crispin  Jones  Lemons  B. Cole  Kite  B. Cole  educations, and it was much easier to proofread those stories and change them.  On Sunday afternoons, we had four riding horses for us kids and then dad had  one, and we couldn   t ride his. He wouldn   t ever let us ride his. We   d all get  out with the neighbors. I don   t know if you   ve ever heard of Dr. O   Tool over  at Stillwater?  Lela.  Uh-huh, Lela. And she was our neighbor. We used to play together and have  more fun. She went to the rural school where I went to school. I went to her  funeral. She never married. They buried her at Thomas with their parents.  Now we have a lady that works at Special Collections, Angela McKim, she  comes from Nebraska. Ms. O   Tool was her mother   s aunt. It   s all connected.  It must have been a Williams or Craig. Her mother was a Williams, and then  Mrs. Emma O   Tool, who was Lela   s mother, and Ed O   Tool was her dad. He  died rather early, and they moved to Thomas so that the kids could go to high  school, and then she taught at Hollis a little while, and then went to Stillwater.  I think she was up at Stillwater. She was the Dean of Women. She went over  to some country far away, and taught the people things. She taught home  economics. There was one in the family that was the same age as every one of  us kids, and we just lived a half a mile apart.  Something she said reminded me. Do any of you remember home  demonstration agents coming and what kinds of things they were  demonstrating?  Uh-huh, they used to come. My mother belonged to a home demonstration  club a while. Of course, they taught them how to sew a little and things that  they did back then. Sewing machines, we had a sewing machine, but not  electric. You had to pump them with your foot.  And the pressure cooker, that was really an improvement for people to can  food. They   d raise a big garden. You didn   t throw any of it away. You saved  it all.  Well, do you remember something standing out when you think about this time  period, thinking things were not so bad, and after this point in time, things  were harder? Do you remember something that sticks out saying, this is hard  times?  Well, I know I used to raise lots of pumpkin and squash, and I   d cut them open  and clean them out and wash them and put butter into them and bake them and  put salt and pepper on them. They were awfully good.  It sounds pretty good.  It was more like eating potatoes.  13  Hedges  Lemons  B. Cole  Hedges  Lemons  B. Cole  Hedges  B. Cole  J. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Hedges  Lemons  B. Cole  Mother cooked on an old wood stove. You carried kindling in at a night and  wood in at night, because when she got up in the morning, she baked biscuits  and made a sauce that was called chocolate gravy that went on our biscuits.  And what is that?  Chocolate gravy and Dutch honey.  It was a cup of sugar, a cup of cream, and a cup and a half of milk, and you  cooked it until it became a gravy consistency, and you poured it over your  biscuits like a gravy. Her kids were not great milk drinkers, and she made lots  of puddings, lots of stuff with milk.  So you still got the nutrition of it without actually having to drink it.  Oh, I   ve got a big box of recipes.  They played cards at night with the neighbors. She had lots of birthday parties  for the kids and the neighbors. We invited the neighbors in.  Even for the kids in school, I   d have birthday parties and let them go outside  on the hayrack and fix hamburgers for them. Kids, all the boys anyhow, they  sure did like to come to eat.  Probably mom   s hardest time was in the real early thirties. Her oldest child,  she lost in    31. At that time, she took care of her mother and her father-in-law  both. She took care of both of those for the rest of their lives.  When did you get married?  In twenty-six.  Yeah, and how did you meet your husband?  Oh, at a dance at Fletcher   s Lake at Putnam.  Right up the road.  Was it love at first sight?  Yeah, it was. We always rode horses. We had our own horses we rode.  When I saw him, well my older sister and I ran together all the time, and if one  had a feller, the other one had one, or we wouldn   t go or we   d go together.   Laughter  That   s where I met Bill. He had to dance with some big husky  woman. I knew her real well, and I didn   t like her  I won   t mention any  names. So when he came off of the floor with her, I just walked up to him,  and I said,    Would you like to dance with a young woman,     laughter  and he  took right in and I did too, because he   d seen me home to my parents.  14  Lemons  J. Cole  Hedges  B. Cole  Hedges  J. Cole  Hedges  B. Cole  Lemons  Jones  Lemons  Jones  Kite  Crispin  That   s a great story.  Of their family, there were three; two brothers married two sisters, and then a  brother married the sister. Three sets of double cousins.  When mom and dad were married, they lived in just a small two-room house,  and Granddad Cole also lived with them. Later in there, Grandma, her mom,  lived with them, about the time that Leroy was born. She and grandma slept  together, and granddad and daddy were in a room.  Bill   s dad had a cot of his own, because he was one-legged. He slept with  Dutch.  Oh, that   s right. He slept with Dutch. They had some brothers of daddy   s that  lived with them.  She lives on a Centennial Farm. Her father-in-law was a half-breed Cherokee,  and he lost a leg. He had his homestead mortgaged, and her dad took it over  and paid it off and took care of him and her mother in the thirties.  She also worked for Aunt Rhode a little bit.  Anything I could do that I had to do, I did it.  It sounds like it. Well do you remember when the dust storms started? What  do you remember about that?  Of course, I wasn   t that old to feel like I was responsible for a lot of things, but  I know at school one day, there was a bad dust storm, and the teacher had us  wet clothes, handkerchiefs, or whatever it was and put around our faces to  keep from breathing all that dust. Then I especially remember one Sunday  evening when a terrible dust storm came in. The way the sun was shining, it  looked like fire, and I thought to myself, surely this is the end of the world.   Laughter  It was so terrible   What did you do?  Went to the cellar. My daddy was yelling at us to go to the cellar. Although,  if it was a storm we went to the cellar, and if we had a dust storm we went to  the cellar.  Laughter   And if it was the end of the world you went to the cellar   Laughter   You know, sometimes, when those would come in, they   d just look like storm  clouds. We   d think, surely we   re going to get a rain. We just thought, oh that  would be so nice, and then in a little while, that dust began to pour in. We got  covers and tacked them up over the windows, because nobody had double  windows then. The old windows would rattle, and then Mother would take  15  Jones  Lemons  Jones  Crispin  Lemons  Crispin  Lemons  B. Cole  J. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  B. Cole  Crispin  Lemons  covers and tack them at the top and bottom so that we   d try to keep out as  much as we could. Then we   d get in the one room that had the least windows,  and, like her, we   d put wash cloths over our face and try to keep from  breathing any more of the dust, but it came in everywhere. You couldn   t keep  it out. We had two porches that were opened, because no one had air  conditioning, and when you had a lot of company   you always did then     people had time to go visit, and we were always having company, and  everybody liked my dad. Those porches would just simply be littered with  dust. They were outside, and it would come through the screen. It   d just be  terrible. It   d take a week to get it all out, and by that time, there   d be another  that would come in.  There was a lot of what they called dust pneumonia.  Did you know people who suffered from dust pneumonia?  I had heard of several, but I don   t remember now. It was terrible.  It was amazing that more people didn   t die from that because they had to  breathe it. I can   t ever remember anyone that they considered just dying from  that.  What about people who left the area because it was hard times and because of  the drought and the dust storms? Do you know anybody who left?  Do you know what they said? They went to California, and it raised the IQ of  both states  That was a joke they told.  What were you going to say?  We had some go to Clinton. My uncle worked on a railroad, but I don   t  remember how they made it or not.  Her family more or less all went to California, or the West Coast anyway, and  my dad   s family also. They   re about the only two of those two families that  stayed here.  So those people that left, did they stay in California or did they come back  after several years?  No, they more or less stayed.  They hammered it out some way. I don   t know how.  A few came back, but the majority of them got good jobs and just stayed.  Well, whenever the dust storms were approaching, do you remember any sort  of signs from animals that might have indicated that there was a storm or that  something big was coming?  16  B. Cole  Lemons  Crispin  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  J. Cole  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  Oh, I don   t know as I do.  With your chickens and your hogs and your cows, nothing was different?  Well the chickens went to roost. They thought that it was night when that  storm came in. It was dark, and the chickens would go to roost just like it was  night   Well what about any sort of travelers that would come through, like tramps  that would come through? Was there anyone like that? Hobos?  Gypsies.  Gypsies? Tell us about the gypsies.  Oh the gypsies. I   d forgotten about them   Did they come up to your house?  Yeah, and usually we were in the field working or something, and they   d come  right out in the field and want you to go with them or want you talk to them.  And would you?  No, I didn   t have time to fool with them.  Of course, while they were talking to you, they were probably stealing  something.  Yeah, they were trying to get a hold of something.  Did you ever notice that they stole something from you guys    place?  No, we always had rented land, and lived pretty well on the highway, where  they traveled, you know. We had rented land, or we   d be pulling cotton for  somebody or pulling broomcorn or heading calves for somebody or something,  just always something for somebody else to get a job.  When the gypsies came, were they in cars? How did they travel?  No, they were usually in covered wagons of some kind. I don   t know how  they had the covered or not, but they were on the highway, and they   d come  down in the field where we were. I don   t know just how they could travel.  They were always in covered wagons of some kind.  Does this sound familiar of other encounters with gypsies, the same sort of  thing?  17  Crispin  Lemons  Crispin  Lemons  Crispin  Kite  Crispin  Lemons  We lived quite a way off the highway, and they never bothered us. We had  salesman.  Oh yeah? What kind of salesman? What were they selling?  Oh, stewers. Mother called one stewer a fairy stewer, and this man sold them.  He didn   t live too far away. It was just a great big enamel stewer. You could  put water with jars in them. That was before pressure cookers. It had a rack in  the bottom, and you could set three or four or five or six. It was pretty big.  Mother kept it hanging up on the back porch. We just used it for canning. We  were fortunate. We had a big apple orchard on our farm. That was nearly the  first thing people did when they came to this country was plant an orchard.  Then my dad bought another place over west from us from people that left,  and they had a big apple orchard, and then he bought another one from some  other people that left, and they had a big apple orchard, and one time some  people came down from Putnam, and I went with them, and they bought  twenty bushels of apples for fifty cents a bushel. We had to shake them off of  the tree and pick them up   Laughter  We had apples; we had delicious  apples. In the fall, dad would wrap them in paper and put them in a box with a  good lid on it, and then he   d set them down in the basement. We had a  basement under the one bedroom, and you had to pull the rug back to open the  door. The door was great big. When people came, we   d pop corn and get out  the apples. Everybody just loved those apples. We ate apples until we felt like  an apple, because we all liked them. The kids would go hunting; we   d all get  out and go hunting at night. We   d hunt opossum, and we tried to avoid  skunks. We   d go opossum hunting, and we   d go to those orchards and get us  apples to eat and have fun playing and catching opossum.  What   d you do with the opossum after you caught it?  Oh, usually they turned them loose, but the boys, a lot of times, skinned them.  We had one mail carrier, and he wasn   t a very happy soul anyway, and those  boys would catch those skunks in traps, and they   d skin them, and he   d have to  take them on the mail route. They mailed it in to sell  He wasn   t very happy,  and I wouldn   t have been either. That   s the way they got a lot of their  spending money. There were lots of skunks and opossum. There were not  many    oh, we   re beginning to have some now. What are they?  Armadillos?  Oh, we had those. They came up from Texas. We went to Texas one time to  visit some relatives, and I said,    Carol, those are such pretty ones. Why don   t  you catch some? We   ll bring them back to Oklahoma,    and he said,    Heavens,  we don   t want those things; we   ve got enough,    but they got there anyway   Now we   ve got them everywhere.  Well, back to the traveling salesman for just a minute, does anybody else  remember traveling salesmen and what kinds of things that they sold?  18  Crispin  J. Cole  Crispin  Jones  Crispin  B. Cole  J. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  Crispin  Jones  J. Cole  B. Cole  Kite  J. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  Well they sold liniment, Watkins, and   what else was it?  Hinklets and cloverleaf salve.  There was Watkins, and     The Raleigh Man.  The Raleigh Man.  Cloverleaf salve? And what?  Those Hinklets.  What did you use that for?  People back then thought that in the Spring you had to be cleaned out, so they  were a laxative.  Laughter   Okay.  That was how you did the Spring cleaning   Laughter  See, there weren   t any  doctors, and really not many drug stores through here. Traveling salesmen  brought most of the stuff that they bought.  What was the best cure? What was the best thing you could buy, all-around,  all-purpose?  Pain reliever.  Laughter   You put so many teaspoons in with some warm water and drink it.  Kerosene and turpentine.  Turpentine was another. My mother really took for turpentine. One of us kids  got a cut place, and she   d dab some sugar in that and pour it full of turpentine.  Boy, it shook your fire for a little bit   Others agree  It sure wasn   t long a  healing.  Hinklets? Is that what you   re saying? H-I-N-K?  L-E-T-S, I suppose. My grandmother was a midwife. She did a lot of the  doctoring until Doctor Lloyd came to Taloga, in the area north and west.  And what was her name? Your grandmother, right?  Susan Busker McGettrick.  So that would be on your dad   s side then, right?  19  Hedges  J. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  J. Cole  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  Jones  Crispin  Lemons  Crispin  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  Mother   s.  No.  No, your mother   s side.  It was mom   s mother. She was four feet eleven and wore a size four shoe.  Tiny.  Yes, she was tiny, but she was mighty. She   d go with those men to their  wives, take care of their babies, take care of their women that were having  babies. She went as far as Webb, from Webb on to Margo, taking care of  women that were having babies. And then they took her in a wagon; that   s the  way they had of going, the men. They   d come and get her. But she was just  like a doctor. She was really good.  In the summer, there weren   t a lot of shoes, so the kids all went barefooted,  and if you stepped on a rusty nail or something you got that sugar and  turpentine. It took care of a lot of it.  What were some of the other medical cures, like if you had the flu or a fever or  something like that, what would you do?  If you had a sore throat, you got it swabbed with kerosene.  Yeah, that sounds awful.  Swabbed it with turpentine.  When I was born in 1911, a doctor lived about twelve miles down toward  Butler. He came, and he had a new model-T Ford. That was the first one  they   d ever seen. Of course I didn   t see it   Laughter  He delivered me. I  think that was the first one of the children that had a doctor. The rest of them  had just had midwives.  What was the doctor   s name that lived down by Butler?  I can   t think of it. Basinger, Dr. Basinger.  Do you remember, in the thirties, any sort of assistance programs from the  government, being involved in any of these sorts of things, or hearing about  them?  The WPA was here, because dad would say that he couldn   t get on WPA.  Yeah, why not?  20  J. Cole  Crispin  Hedges  B. Cole  Crispin  J. Cole  Crispin  Lemons  B. Cole  Hedges  B. Cole  Hedges  B. Cole  J. Cole  Crispin  Well, he just didn   t get a job on it. They were talking about the hides; there  was a bounty on coyote ears. They shipped the hides, like skunk and coon and  opossum. They were shipped. They   d skin them and stretch them and ship  them. That   s one of the ways that they made what money they needed.  They had boards that they put them on to stretch them, and then they   d take  them off and put them in sacks to mail.  What did they do for the old folk   s home? How did they take care of the old  people?  They didn   t take care of them. You took care of them yourself.  You know, we   re getting bobcats now. They call them panthers. They   re  beginning to come into our country. We had a cousin come up the other night,  and he said that he went out on the road, and he said he wouldn   t have  believed it. He lived down by Arapaho, and my son had seen one on our farm  before. They   re huge. He said he got out his binoculars, and he said that it  just sat and looked at him. Have you all seen any bobcats up here?  We   ve got lots of bobcats.  They   re beginning to get into the country. They   re turning them loose so they  will. I don   t know why they want things like that in the country, because they  kill baby calves. This one man said that they killed a baby calf, and they ate  half of it, and they dug a hole and left the other half and covered it, and he  found it, the dead half calf. They   d killed two or three for him, and now we   re  going to have to watch out for them.  You had a story over here that you wanted to tell.  I forgot about it, I guess.  It was about how old people were cared for.  I don   t remember now.  When they took care of the old people.  Oh, at Taloga. They took care of them, and they called it the    Poor Man   s  Farm.    They just had an old shed of a house, and in that old shed of a house  they had   I called them big old oil tanks   for the people to use for toilets. I  can remember that.  If your family didn   t take care of you when you were old, you went to the poor  farm.  Do you remember the stories about Red Buck in Oklahoma? You never did?  21  Kite  Crispin  B. Cole  Crispin  B. Cole  Crispin  B. Cole  Crispin  B. Cole  Crispin  Red Buck?  Red Buck. He was an outlaw. He went all over this country. They searched  and searched for him. One night, they were all up to my grandmothers    and  Uncle Dick   s and dad and all of them, they were having a party out in the yard.  One of the men there raised beautiful horses, Tom Crowder. All of them had  horses, but the rattlesnakes were so bad that all of them wore six-shooters.  The rattlesnakes were just all over this country, and I   m afraid they   re going to  start again, because they   re beginning to kill them now. One time we went ten  miles where there used to be a house every half-mile or a mile at least, and we  drove ten miles, and there was not one house with anyone living in that area.  We got to the corner there, and there wasn   t anyone living there. There had  been a couple, and they moved away. Then we went on south about six miles,  and there were two houses in all of that distance. But Red Buck was an  outlaw, and I supposed everybody had heard about him. He had a family  across the river that he stayed with some. Do you remember their names?  I sure do.  What was it?  Dan Wise.  Well anyway, he stopped and they had shot one of the horses that the men  were riding, and there were two riding one horse. So they saw the lights, that  they were out in the yard and having a party, and they asked if they could buy  a horse, and none of them wanted to sell their horses. They liked them. He  especially wanted this one of Tom Crowder   s, because he always raised  beautiful horses, but he told them no. They all had their six-shooters, because  my dad said he had seen a rattlesnake bite a horse, and he said that that horse  didn   t get a quarter of mile    til it fell down dead, because those rattlesnakes  had so much venom in them. They were just everywhere when the pioneers  first came here. They got them about all killed out. We still have prairie  snakes, you understand. Anyway, Red Buck finally decided that none of them  were going to sell him a horse, so he said he   d go on across the river to those  people that he stayed with some, and he thought that maybe he could get a  horse over there. They said he was buried at Arapaho. They killed him out  west of Arapaho in a dugout. He started to come out of the dugout, and they  shot him.  He was killed right over southwest of our place, over by Webb. He stopped  there and talked to my dad at the wagon.  Oh, well in the historical book, they say he was killed west of Arapaho.  But that   s where he was.  He was buried at Arapaho, and they talked about taking up his body and using  DNA to see if it was really him. Some of them said that he went to Texas and  22  B. Cole  Crispin  J. Cole  Kite  B. Cole  Crispin  Lemons  B. Cole  Kite  Crispin  Hedges  Crispin  B. Cole  Kite  Crispin  Kite  J. Cole  Kite  got away and nobody ever knew. Anyway, the sheriff at Custer County killed  him. Ventioner.  And Ernie Ventioner at Webb killed him.  Oh, well this was Ventioner that killed him, but the historical book says west  of Arapaho, and that   s where he was with some other people. He had a Miller  with him that was from Custer. They shot off Miller   s hand, but they didn   t  kill him. They took him. I   ve forgotten what the Miller   s name was.  That family was neighbors to my grandparents up there, and he came to see  their daughter. They had a double walled house, and if anybody came around,  they   d put in between the walls. My grandmother said that it was not  uncommon for the horses in the lot at night, for them the next morning to have  different horses. He would leave his horses and take their horses.  And their name was Dan Wise?  Dan Wise, uh-huh.  Look in the historical book. You   ve got a historical book over there, and  check it.  There was lot of excitement going on over by your house   I was just a baby.  What was Red Buck known for? Did he rob banks?  Oh, he was an outlaw, everything. He killed people and robbed them and took  horses and stole.  I don   t know where he originally came from.  He stole from the rich and gave to the poor.  Laughter   Yeah, that   s what he did.  Do you believe he did that?  I know he did that, or my folks did.  What stories did they tell about him?  Just what she   s telling you and what I   m telling you. She   s forgot a lot of it,  but that   s what they told.  Did you all get any money from him, or do you remember any stories about  getting money from him?  23  J. Cole  Hedges  J. Cole  Hedges  B. Cole  Crispin  Kite  J. Cole  Kite  J. Cole  J. Cole  Hedges  Crispin  Kite  Lemons  Crispin  Kite  Crispin  No, but like the horses.  Huh-uh.  My grandmother would always say that they were always at least as good or  better horses than what they took.  They were just tired.  I was little. I can   t remember much of it, but I know he came through there.  The folks made us go in the house, and they talked to him out by the well  where he watered his horses. They said that they were after him then, so they  moved on over by the Perry Gore place and the old Ventioner place. That   s  where they had their shootout. That was west of our homestead.  Who was it they killed over there in that schoolhouse one time? They had a  fight there. It was a couple of people, but it wasn   t Red Buck.  So was he respected in the area?  By some people, but a lot of people didn   t.  In the eastern part of Oklahoma they have Pretty Boy Floyd.  There is a little book of Red Buck that   s in this area. Have you looked up at  the jailhouse, Pauline?  Asking someone in the room   That   s quite a little story.  There is one at the library at Sentinel.  Well he is buried in Arapaho Cemetery. They   re having something right away  at Clinton, and half the thing is going to be on stories about Red Buck. I  thought about writing and sending in this one where he stopped at the folks     house, but I didn   t.  You guys should write in something about him.  Tell them your stories.  Oh, he was well known everywhere. He traveled the country everywhere.  When he needed a horse, he tried to buy one from somebody. He almost got  killed a number of times, but he got away. You have a historical book, so you  can look at Dewey County. I imagine it   s in the first one.  I   ll check it out.  But you   ve got one and two both over there at Stillwater, haven   t you?  24  Kite  Lemons  Crispin  B. Cole  Crispin  Lemons  B. Cole  J. Cole  Crispin  Yeah.  Yeah.  My niece lives in Houston. I was never so shocked, and she said she went up  to the library, and there were the two Dewey County historical books. We still  have money in our historical fund from selling those books. We sold an  enormous amount. They called it Spanning the River, and this river over here,  it didn   t have a bridge on it, the South Canadian, and the quicksand was bad.  You could get out in the middle of it, and a horse would bog down, and you  couldn   t get it out without a lot of help. It   d go clear down to as far as its     body and then even sink on out of sight. That river, it now has nothing but  weeds and a little stream out in the middle. We lived on the Lenmer Ranch,  and we could see the river. One morning, my husband was milking, and he  came running up to the house, and he said,    Come here     The river was  coming down. When it came down, it was huge, and it was about this high  and just clear across the whole thing. It wasn   t just partly, it was the width of  the river. It would wash out the railroad bridge. They didn   t have a bridge.  They had a ferry at Camargo, and you could get on that ferry and cross if you  had to go across the river. The rest of them, once in a while, they   d try to go  just through the quicksand. They had a little trap.  Well they had the Indian Ford and the Farmer Ford up by Webb.  They were not, neither one of them, bridges. The first bridges they ever built  were at Camargo. Then they built one at Taloga. We have one, and they   re  talking about putting in a new one now. That was why we named the  historical book Spanning the River, because it was a real handicap for the  people on the north side and the south side of the river.  What are the Indian Ford and the Farmer Ford? Were they just places to  cross the river?  Yeah, different places.  The Farmer Ford was McGettrick Ford. It came off of the end of their  homestead farm on the north side of the river. Mrs. Collier made up a map of  Dewey County, and if you can find it, you   ll find that Ford on that map.  This Livenmore Ranch that we lived on for four years, a teacher in Chicago  had her dad and his wife   they called him Colonel   and they said he rode  around on a great big, tall horse, and held his head high. He wouldn   t have  anything to do with any of the neighbors. He said he was a colonel in the Civil  War, so Miss Livenmore, she wasn   t married, she intended to make a dude-ranch  out of it. She had a man build a barn out there where we lived. That  was before we got there. It had big wings on the side of it, and she said that  when they came up from the river on horses, they could stand under there and  be cool off  laughing . She became ill. She had a real good friend that was a  25  Lemons  Crispin  Lemons  J. Cole  nurse. She taught school in Chicago and thought she had teacher   s retirement,  you know, teachers    money to pay for things, and come to find out, she didn   t,  so she gave this ranch to a nurse that would take care of her until she passed  away. The nurse had it two years, and then we bought it. We still own it, and  that   s the place that my son, this spring, he leased out days, and he had a trailer  house up by where we lived before we went to the nursing home, and he would  let them stay all night in the trailer, those people that came from Oklahoma  City and Elk City and Clinton and everywhere, and they killed forty-one deer.  Of course, they just have a certain season they can kill them, you know, but it  was just in the Spring of the year when they were beginning to come out of the  river. They stay in the river a lot in the wintertime. The river, it was just full  of weeds and trees and bushes. It has a place in it now, they put three or four  damns in it up above, so there   s hardly any water that comes down it anymore.  The kids would get out in that river when it was that high, and it was swift.  When it washed out the railroad bridge, they would get those piled and take  them out to the land and sell them for posts  laughing . It was dangerous. It  was really dangerous. That river was swift.  Well, I just want to back up to something you mentioned earlier about your  dad trying to get work with the WPA. What was the general feeling towards  Roosevelt and the    New Deal?     Extremely good, extremely good. We married in    37 and in 1941 Roosevelt  loaned money to buy 320 acres of land and build a house. So we went into the  program. They chose ten from Dewey County, and we were one of the ten.  We didn   t have any electricity, so they brought all of the    What was the  name of that company from Oklahoma City that built it? They brought all of  the wood, pre-sod. Then they had a gasoline sander, and nobody had ever seen  floors sanded before. They were so surprised. We built the bungalow. We  had a front porch and a living room and a dining room and a kitchen and two  bedrooms in the house. Later on, we added a big den on the south, and then  we turned it into a room for the washer and just odds and ends. I made a deal,  and you would love to see them. There were eight in our family, and oh, one  of them is a lawyer and they run banks and do this. I made a book for every  one of them, and every time anything came out in the paper about any of them  or the kids, I put it in those books. I ordered plastic sheets from California,  and they don   t let anything fade for a hundred years. Some of the things that I  had kept before turned yellow out of the newspapers. Now, I made one, and I  take them to the reunion, and they all begin to grab them to see what   s in them  about them this time.  Do you think that your dad has a positive or negative view of FDR?  Yes, my dad had a positive view. Roosevelt   s    New Deal    is what brought  them out of the thirties and depression. The livestock was worthless, and they  had no place to go to feed them. As your livestock produces, if you don   t  move at all, pretty soon, you have over population, and that   s what they got to.  They couldn   t sell them, and they couldn   t feed them, but they still were  producing, so in Roosevelt   s    New Deal,    he came out and killed the livestock  26  Lemons  Crispin  Hedges  B. Cole  Hedges  Lemons  Hedges  Lemons  J. Cole  Crispin  and buried them and paid the farm people for them. That eventually brought  them out of depression and started them out.  In this livestock-killing program, do you remember anyone who thought that  that wasn   t a good idea?  Oh, they were happy to have it. It was the first opportunity that the people had  to even try to get out of the depression. Didn   t you all think so? They hired  the people to work for WPA, and then they loaned this money. We were the  first ones in the county to pay back all of our loan.  Was this when they took the cows over the hill and killed them?  Uh-huh.  I can remember Mom saying that when they got rid of the cows, they took  them over the cliff and shot them and killed them. It was heartbreaking.  I could see how people, even though they thought that financially it was a good  thing to, do how they could still be bothered by it.  Be attached.  Attached to their animals they   d been caring for.  Most people just had about every quarter section or some eighties in this  county had homesteads on them; people lived there. They all had milk cows,  and those milk cows reproduced calves, and they could not sell them, so pretty  soon, they were over populated. They had nothing for them to eat. My dad   s  horses that he farmed with, a lot of the time, he would put them in a section  line so they would have something to eat so he could farm with them.  Gold Spot started coming through. That was a milk company, and they bought  the milk. My husband would wake up at four o   clock and would milk ten  cows and set the milk out for them to come in. Then he   d come in and start  breakfast and wake me up, and I   d get the kids up, and I taught school for 34  years, and I   d get the kids ready to go to school, and then I   d get ready to go to  school, we   d all take off, and he   d go to the field. I said to him,    Why don   t  you go over to the caf   at Putnam and eat dinner,    and he said,    Well I can  come in and cook.    He always cooked for his mother anyway. He cooked at  home. He said that his brother couldn   t even boil water without burning it    Laughter  He said,    I can come in and cook me some dinner and get back in  the field before I could get my order in over at the caf  . He worked hard all of  his life. He could pick more cotton than anybody in the country, but there was  a minister, Paully Bowser, and he didn   t get his story in either one of those  books, and he went everywhere preaching. I don   t know how many funerals.  I bet that preacher didn   t know. He lived over by Ledo, which was a little  store about three miles west of Burmah, where we lived. He could pull more  broomcorn than Carol. Carol said he   d just work his head off trying to beat  27  Lemons  J. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Lemons  B. Cole  Hedges  B. Cole  Hedges  B. Cole  J. Cole  Lemons  Jones  Lemons  Jones  Lemons  him, but he could always beat him pulling broomcorn. Carol could pick a  thousand   that was picking   and he picked a thousand pounds. Now they  bowl it, or you don   t do any of that work anymore. If kids had worked like we  did, they   d have a running fit   Laughter   Well, what would you say, and each of you have a chance, and we   ll start with  them and go down; when you think about the dust bowl and the dirty thirties,  what is the first thing that comes to mind? What is your most vivid mental  picture about that time?  I don   t really remember any dust bowl, except what my parents talked about,  but the chickens going to roost and the sheets over the windows. In the fifties,  we had some dust, but I   m satisfied that it wasn   t anything like the thirties.  Those were the problems that they had.  How about for you? When you think about that time what comes to mind?  I don   t want to think about it.  You try not to.  I don   t try. When I got away from it, I said that I never wanted to see or hear it  again.  What about the cactus that grew?  I know.  Out south of mom and dad   s house, there was a prairie hill, and she said that  nothing would grow there except a cactus. They   d rake the cactus.  Oh, big cactus   prickly pear is what they were called. There were just  bunches of them. There wasn   t anything there but them.  That was a result of overgrazing. When they had that over-population of  livestock, they burnt the spines off of those cactus and fed them to the  livestock to give them something to eat.  How about you?  I guess just the dirty thirties.  Laughter   A pink cloud looking like fire.  It was just dirty. I didn   t have the responsibility. I wasn   t old enough, like  some of these others did, having to go through the raising of family and all.  Even as a small child, seeing something like that is pretty incredible.  28  Jones  Crispin  Lemons  Crispin  Lemons  Kite  Jones  Crispin  J. Cole  Kite  J. Cole  Kite  J. Cole  Yeah, you remember it for along time.  Oh, I just remember everything you touched was gritty and dirty. You just  hated to touch anything. You   d clean it up, and in just a little while, it   d be the  same thing again. Of course, when you whisk it with a broom, it just blew  everywhere. It was outside. And people would even get stuck in cars. It   d be  drifted in the roads, and they   d even get stuck in their cars and have to get out  and push to get them out.  It was pretty scary.  It was awful.  Do you have any other questions you want to ask?  No, I don   t think so. I   m satisfied.  I want to tell about my Grandfather Burton. He was a Baptist minister. This is  relating to the river. On like a Saturday evening, my grandmother would fix  his clothes for him, and he would ride his horse across the river. Sometimes,  the water was so deep that he had to put his Bible in his hat and ride the horse  across to this side where he preached between her and Taloga. His name was  William Curtis Burton. He was born in 1876, and he made the run. He lived  on this land that is still in the family.  You know, in the later days, they didn   t make the run; they just filed on the  land, and you had to live on it for five years. They didn   t make the run.  That   s when my uncle came. The people that lived on the land hadn   t made  the run; they just filed, and then they had to live there for five years, but you  could buy a relinquishment from them if they wanted to leave, but then you  had to live there for five years.  Mom   s mother and Dad   s families both worked on the railroad as it came  down across Kansas. That   s when they heard of the run, so they came down  and made their run.  Was it the KD Railroad? Do you remember which one it was?  It was the main line that came down with the cattle drive and stuff, when they  built down across Kansas. I can   t tell you what it was called. My  grandmother and grandfather homesteaded on adjoining quarters, and they  built their cabin on the line. They brought a schoolteacher with them since  they had eleven kids  laughter  and homesteaded. And then my grandmother   s  dad homesteaded a quarter also. So they had five quarters between them, but  they lost all of those in the thirties.  Did they mortgage on it?  Mortgages or whatever. They just couldn   t pay the taxes. There   s a lot of land  29  Kite  J. Cole  Hedges  J. Cole  Hedges  B. Cole  Kite  B. Cole  J. Cole  Crispin  right here in this area at one time that was taken over for taxes.  But you said she   s on a Centennial Farm right now.  That   s on my dad   s side. He was a half-breed Cherokee, and he was here  somewhere in the 1880   s, before there was ever a run, so he just stayed. Then  he finally proved it.  Mother   s family lived across the river   west   by Lenora and Webb. Then  daddy   s family lived where mother is still living today.  Three miles north of Putnam.  I heard her tell about forging the river. She would forge the river to come  across to see daddy.  If there was a dance at Fletcher   s Lake.  How would you keep from getting wet to go to the dance? Did you bring other  clothes?  Well, we had other clothes, and we had a sister that lived on the other side of  the river in the family. That   s where we   d stay all night when we   d come in  from the dance.  That sister lived close to the south end of the McGettrick Ford.  My mother came from Illinois, and her mother   s sister was married to a  Sheppard, and the Sheppards and the Merical, they came clear from up there to  Crawford, Texas. They were on the road in covered wagons for six months.  They lived down there about ten years, and then they came to Paul   s Valley.  One of the Sheppards bought some land there, and they happened to strike oil  on it, but none of the rest of them were that fortunate. When they began to let  them file on the land in Custer County, all of the Mericals came to Custer  County, and every one of them filed on land. My grandmother and her son,  they had one son, and he was a rover. He couldn   t stay anywhere very long, so  he bought a cotton gin from my two uncles and took it to old Mexico. When  they got down to old Mexico, he wrote and wanted grandma and Uncle  Charles to come, and they went, too. They sold their land. When they got  down there, they hadn   t been there but a year and they had that Mexican  Revolution, and they got out with nothing. They were glad to just get out with  their lives. Grandma and Uncle Charles came back to Oklahoma. They didn   t  have any land or anything to live on. We had bought the place that I told you  about that had the orchard, and so dad let them have the house there. It was a  big two-story house. He wanted mother to move over there, and she said,     Heavens, no. I don   t want these kids running up and down the stairs all day      So he let grandma live there and gave Uncle Charles a team of horses and let  them use his plows and things to farm with so he   d have a way to make a  living. People managed in those days.  30  Kite  Jones  Crispin  Lemons  One way or the other.  They survived anyhow. They were survivors.  My dad, he had an uncle that had borrowed a bunch of money and ran a store  at Burmah. He had borrowed a bunch of money, and he went to Montana  without paying it back, so my dad and uncle paid him off. It was their half-brother,  and they paid him off. That just irked mother to death, until her  mother came back and dad let them have the horses and the land there to farm.  Then she didn   t complain as much anymore  But when my nephew went to  Thomas, he   s a lawyer, everybody in the county knew my dad. They came  and tried to get him to run for commissioner, and he told them no, that politics  and religion didn   t mix. He was superintendent of the church for fifteen years  and taught Sunday school classes. When C.B. went to Thomas one day to be a  lawyer   he lives in Clinton   one of the men down there said,    I heard that  you   re Charlie Grass    grandson,    and C.B. said,    Yeah, but I didn   t get to  know him.    He said,    Well, if you were just half as big as he was, you   d be a  giant.    My son carried the mail down there, and when he went down, this  same man said,    I hear you   re Charlie Grass    son   s grandson,    and he said,     Yeah,    and he said,    His word was his bond.    He said that if he told you  something, you believed it.  Well, I think that   s all of the questions that we have for you guys. Thanks for  coming in and talking with us.  -------  -------
