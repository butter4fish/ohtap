Story_ID: 461374
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're gonna ask you a few questions that are a little more--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a little more things about your personality.  What is your favorite food, Mr. Gordon [HistoryMaker Walter L. Gordon, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: I hadn't thought about that but I would probably favor liver and onions.  I would favor a good steak and prime rib and ice cream, and I believe that would about cover everything, but I could stretch out and I could accommodate not only that type of food but other types.  I'm--I am apparently just one of those people who likes food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I like a good formal black and I always have admired someone to have white hair.  I thought the combination was marvelous.
Speaker 1: And your favorite vacation destination.

Speaker 2: Well, I play pool, I play racehorses, I play poker, I play lowball, I play dice, and other than those, I'm ready for any other new ones.
Speaker 1: So, do you like places where, where you can go gamble like Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] or places like of that nature (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've been--yes, I, I practiced law for sixty-five years and probably that's--that is probably one of the records here in California, and I prided myself on having worked hard to play hard and to do things that were different.  And I enjoyed racetrack.  I've been to every track in the country.  I've been to track in Mexico and most of the fair tracks, and I carried my wife [Clara Gordon] with me and we were a great team.  By the way, I should've mentioned, she passed away in December of 2006, so she hasn't been gone long, but we really enjoyed things together.
Speaker 1: And what is your favorite phrase or saying that you--that you like to adopt, a phrase that you might have?
Speaker 2: I have no favorite phrases.  I, I enjoy a good conversation.  I am probably best described as a man's man.  I didn't--women weren't a great favorite of mine, although I enjoy them.  And I would--a good conversation with men is a great stimulant for me.
Speaker 1: And your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year would be around June or July near my birthday and, and it's the mid-summertime and I used to enjoy all of the sports.
Story_ID: 461375
Speaker 1: Now, we're gonna move into your life now, Mr. Gordon [HistoryMaker Walter L. Gordon, Jr.], and we want to talk about your early years and we'd like to start with your mother.  Could you please tell, tell us her name, please, your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Vertner, V-E-R-T-N-E-R, Gordon.  Her maiden name is Vertner Lewis [Vertner Lewis Gordon].  She was raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, and went and graduated from Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  Now, Southern University at her time of living in New Orleans was located in New--in New Orleans and that's before, before Southern University moving to another part of Louisiana.  My mother graduated from Southern University and she was a very artistic lady, lovely lady.  She played the piano.  She could sing.  She was an excellent cook.  She was a teacher.  She was a woman who devoted herself to women affairs like aiding young women who were in need and prepare them to go to higher education and to aid them if they (unclear) and furnish them funds and money.  She helped with Ralph Bunche in raising money to send him to school, Florence Talbert [Florence Cole Talbert] who was a great singer.  And she also Mari- thought--sent money to Europe to aid Marian Anderson and as much as we ultimately lived in a small suburbs near Pasadena [California], she was the sole black person in this community of Schuetzen Park [Rose Hill Park, Los Angeles, California], a German park, and she--although the only sole black person in that park that is a black woman, she succeeded in becoming a leader in the community and in the parent teachers association of that community.  My mother also succeeded in being president of the Southern California alumni association, an association devoted to graduates, particularly women graduates from high school and college, and there were a few of them.  In the period that my mother was prominent here in Southern California, she didn't have many women to work with her because of the scarcity of them.  They--there weren't many graduates of schools of any kind in those days.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you know about her early years as a child?  Did she share any special stories about her childhood with you?
Speaker 2: No, she was very dedicated to school and she grew up in a time in New Orleans when the men and women devoted a great deal of time to the arts, to the arts, to me, and her, and the others, contemporaries of that time.  It meant when they studied Romance languages, they were very much acquainted with Shakespeare [William Shakespeare], through quotes from 'Caesar' ['Julius Caesar,' William Shakespeare] and to quote from Latin phrases was a hobby.  And one way of playing with one another was to more or less imitate the way they thought some of the Romans talked and spoke, and that made me very much acquainted with Roman phrases and what Brutus [Marcus Junius Brutus] said to Caesar [Julius Caesar] and what Caesar said to Brutus.  And this made the household one of intellectuality in a sense because her consciousness of how important those arts were.

Speaker 1: Now, your father.  Tell us his name and where was he born?
Speaker 2: Beg, beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: Your father.  Tell us his name and where he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father did not graduate from high school.
Speaker 1: His name is?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: He--but he went to--
Speaker 1: His name was Walter Gordon, Sr. [Walter L. Gordon, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  His name is Walter Gordon, Sr.  I was a junior [HistoryMaker Walter L. Gordon, Jr.].  And my father was a short man.  My size, my height is close to 6'.  My father's height was only about 5'7".  My father was bow-legged and so was I.  My father went to high school and he must've been a good student because after leaving high school, he came to California.  He went to Africa.  He sought to mine in Africa.  He was there during the Boer War [Second Boer War].  He carried with him a mining kit with the various chemicals used to detect metals and ore.  And he continued to improve himself so much so that he lured some other guys here who grew up with him in New Orleans [Louisiana].  They grew up in New Orleans, but he attracted them out here to California.  He ran a window cleaning establishment in Santa Monica [California] and had eighteen men, each one with a bicycle, each one with cleaning materials, and this company was known as the Gordon window cleaning company [Gordon Day Work Company, Ocean Park, California].  He left Ocean Park in Santa Monica in the early 1900s, probably between 1900 and 1908, my birth, and he immediately came to Los Angeles City [Los Angeles, California], about fifteen miles away.  And there, he took U.S. government postal carriers examination.  He passed it, became a letter carrier.  Then, he took another examination and became a mounted letter carrier in South Pasadena [California] where he had--he managed and drove a little postal wagon and had assigned to him the top district for a letter carrier in Pasadena at that time.  It was in Millionaires' Row, they called it.  And on Millionaires' Row, there was a, a stream of beautiful homes all in excess way up in the thousands of dollars.  Those homes, everyone had a huge yard, had dogs that were usually beautiful masterpieces and beautiful specimens.
Story_ID: 461377
Speaker 1: From there, after working for about fifteen years or so in the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] and learning that you couldn't retire, you had to quit your job or work until you were sixty or sixty-five, he resigned from the post office, moved all his operation to Los Angeles [California], became a real estate broker.  He wrote a beautiful (unclear).  He became active in organizations like the L.A. Forum [Los Angeles Forum] and the L.A. Forum was the black organization, civic in structure.  And as they--when the, the members of the forum, they became acquainted with the political setup here in Los Angeles.  They would invite important speakers.  They would address civic problems.  And all in all, he became a very influential citizen.  My mother [Vertner Lewis Gordon] in the meanwhile operated simultaneously as a kind of a co-associate.  He had--he had this real estate firm, which my mother was the office receptionist.  She took care of the calls, took care of the accounting, took care of the various city organizations, and my father [Walter L. Gordon, Sr.] was the agent, the top agent in the distributing of The Crisis magazine, the Chicago Defender, the Negro World [sic. Negro Digest; Black World], the Balto- Baltimore American [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers], and the Norfolk Journal and Guide [New Journal and Guide].  Now, he having the distributorship of those various periodicals, would deliver them at night for, for various barbershops, drugstores, grocery stores.  And every week thereafter, he would pick up leftovers and I would assist him in putting them on back of an old Pope motorcycle in which we cavorted back and forth between the City of Los Angeles and this little country place called Schuetzen Park near Pasadena [California] where we lived.  And that was probably our beginning.
Story_ID: 461378
Speaker 1: So, do you know how your parents met or where they met, your, your father [Walter L. Gordon, Sr.] and mother [Vertner Lewis Gordon]?
Speaker 2: My father and mother--my father was born in Woodville, Mississippi.  His mother was a slave.  I never got to see her or to meet her.  His--he had five or six brothers and sisters.  We were never able to associate one with the other because of slavery.  And we--another odd situation that happened to rise out of circumstances beyond our control is that when I first visited Oakland, California, as a lawyer, my name was Walter Gordon [HistoryMaker Walter L. Gordon, Jr.].  The greatest football player at that time at the University of California [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], a black man was named of all names, Walter Gordon [Walter A. Gordon].  And we knew we were, were related but because of circumstances, slavery and so forth, we never got associated with each other until we were mature adults, and then we would learn from various people that we were related.  So, consequently, when I went to, to--several times to practice in the courts up in Oakland, they--they'd be very much confused as to which Walter Gordon it was, me or my uncle.  And that was a very happy circumstance and happy occasion to kind of celebrate.  Walter Gordon up north, and this is not generally commented upon, Walter Gordon up north was the first black police officer in Berkeley, California.  He was a member of the great California wonder team.  So, here I was with the same name and getting quite a bit of publicity and it was very confusing for the officials in the courthouse up there and officials in the courthouse down here to know who people were talking about.  And by way of might say humorous circumstance, the Walter Gordon from up north created a situation in a nightclub here in Los Angeles [California], in my territory, and attracted a whole lot of police attention on one occasion, and the papers wrote up about Walter Gordon and he got me, me kind of confused in the circumstances wherein the people believed that the gentleman raising all the, the difficulties down here was me and not the Walter up north.  So, this caused a, a humorous ending in the case that was pending down here when I was able to establish on the floor of this meeting that it was Walter Gordon of Berkeley not Walter Gordon of Los Angeles.  The--these were interesting circumstances that developed along the way.
Story_ID: 461379
Speaker 1: Oh, go ahead (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was, was admitted to school, kindergarten school when I was four, four year- four years old or more or less, and the little school children were ushered into a room for introductory services.  And all of us little guys were introduced one to the other and it was a very--a very interesting little scene.  We were meeting each other for the first time in grammar school.  And that had a--cut a great chocolate cake and we all had had our share of the cake and I had mine, too, but I had always been used to second helpings, so I remember when the school teacher, not the principal, asked the kids whether or not they wished some more cake, I who had always been the one asking for a, a second helping at home and who had not been raised with other children, I asked for the second piece and the school principal interjected into the ceremony and says, "No you cannot have anymore and you should not have asked for more," and also that, "You should not say can I have some more cake.  There's no such word as can.  You could--should've said, may I have some more cake?"  And that stuck with me as a fine introduction to the school principal.  Her name was Henrietta Glissman.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of this school?
Speaker 2: Beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: The school's name?
Speaker 2: The, the school was the Rose Hill grammar school [Rose Hill Elementary School; Huntington Drive Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] on Huntington Drive on the way to Sierra Vista [California] and South Pasadena [California].  And this principal who I saw for the first time at that little breakfast, she was tall, six foot, had a small mustache, and she--very stern visaged, V-I-S-A-G-E-D, and she--after making that statement to me, I studied her and all of us studied her, we found out she was Prussian.  And the Prussians were the people who were declaring war on everybody in Europe because this is about 1914 or less.  And she, this lady was a threat to all the students.  She was kind of a mean woman.  And on numerous occasions thereafter, she remembered me and I remembered her. And I--since I was the only black person in the class and was often being addressed as coon and nigger, and she would be watching from up, second story window where she could watch the playground.  She would very quickly detect any difficulty that I might be involved in and from that window, she would bellow, "Walter [HistoryMaker Walter L. Gordon, Jr.], you come up here."  And she would constantly threaten sending me to a special school.
Story_ID: 461380
Speaker 1: I managed to--through my mother [Vertner Lewis Gordon] to be--remain in the school [Rose Hill Elementary School; Huntington Drive Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] primarily because my mother was active and became the president of the parent teachers association and because of the war [World War I, WWI].  This principal as Prussian.  She looked it, she walked it.  Every move in her body indicated or made us remember that she was German.  And it ended up that a very obnoxious sign was spread across the boulevard about, "Japs and Germans, don't let the sun set on you here."  And a lot of prejudice and critical declarations were made, aimed at this principal now because the tables had changed.  The Prussians and the--and the Germans were people who were not being admired.  They were being criticized and there was a ouster asked of this German principal.  So, the German principal joined forces with my, my mother and she had to aid--have my mother aid her to remain as principal of the school.  So, I was able to finish school.  But as time went on and I graduated from that school, I would seek to let this principal know who, who I was and that I was the one that she had more or less was critical in her--in her addressing those remarks about the cake and that I was still going in there fighting, going to school.  I told her when I graduate--graduated from university--from university, that I had graduated and I also pointed out that none of my other fellow students had graduated.  And so when I graduated from law school [The Ohio State University College of Law; Michael E. Moritz College of Law, Columbus, Ohio] back in Ohio, I let her know it.  I didn't ever hear from her.  And then when I started practicing law, I let her have it and I sent her a poster where I was boosting my candidacy, but I didn't hear from her.  And then twenty years later, I and a fellow black student were--the, the student became David W. Williams, a judge, the first black federal judge in California.  He and I were in a federal--in a courtroom in Santa Monica [California] and I--we noticed that some old files had been left in the courtroom.  They were left there by a preceding judge who had been transferred to another court, and inadvertently, they had left these files there.  Now, the--I picked up the files and inspected them, was amazed.  And then I picked up another one and noted it was related to the first file.  And I and the judge spoke and the judge commented, what are these files being--left here?  So that kind of got our attention.  And I discovered the name.  The name on one of the first files was Henrietta Glissman, the very principal that had addressed me on the morning of the chocolate cake.  And the second file was her sister.  So for some reason, the, the principal and her sister were in--being administered--their estate was being administered from that courtroom.  So, I was able to remark to this judge, David Williams, "Look, what a coincidence.  This lady finally contacted me, finally let me talk to her, and I'm able to see her in these circumstances."  And that to me was rewarding enough because of all the time that I had slaved in that kindergarten and in school and she was the principal.  She never, never expressed any admiration or gave me any type of greeting, never acknowledged that she knew that I succeeded in school, never had--she never had a graduate from her school that had even finished uni--
Story_ID: 461381
Speaker 1: She knew when I was running for office.  She knew statements they quoted me in the paper saying--and she knew I was being regarded and respected in the community and I was the guy that she gave so much hell to and wanted to send me--
Speaker 2: To a special school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) persistently to a special school.
Speaker 2: So, tell us more about Miss Glissman [Henrietta Glissman].
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: Tell, tell us more about finding out--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --finding out about Miss Glissman.
Speaker 1: I have to get my bearings now.  Let's see.
Speaker 2: The courtroom experience that you had.
Speaker 1: I have so many stories, so many.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Say that again?
Speaker 2: The, the probate that you had for the school teacher.  Tell us about, about that, the probate.  You had her estate and you found her file in the courtroom.
Speaker 1: Oh, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You were telling us about--
Speaker 1: --that was where I was.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 461382
Speaker 1: My mother [Vertner Lewis Gordon]--I was telling you about how very, very dedicated she was to young people.  She had been pushed and aided and studied and more or less respected in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And she was not a star in looks but she was a beautiful woman, but you could see she wasn't aiming to impress people with looks.  She was plain, plain without being decorated.  And so my mother--the various students who looked and showed promise here in Los Angeles [California], she would learn who they were.  They knew who she was and they would all come to her.  Everyone needed aid then.  People didn't have money.  And, to give you an example, just a single example was that in the matter of acquiring a home, blacks could only own a home on or near one block of Central Avenue.  I might have made an error here slightly, but by that, you could only go over about to San Pedro Street in Los Angeles from Central Avenue.  Central Avenue was the key.  Now you got--if you moved and bought a home more than two or three blocks west of Central Avenue, you could--not allowed to live in it.  You could buy the home and the big decision that blacks began to applaud was the fact where at least we can buy that property.  Previously, they were enforcing where you couldn't even buy.  So, that was a big decision.  And then--so, San Pedro Street north and now it would be one block, two or three blocks from Central Avenue west.  And then Alameda Street was one or two, three blocks east.  So, you were limited to that territory and the people were squeezing in to that small county and those small streets and the houses became tumbling down and unrepairable, and some of them had to be torn down, and that made this a very tight territory where you couldn't get a good looking home.  Now, as the people crowded in the town and would have to be forced into this cubbyhole, sentiment passed along in conversation and blacks became very disturbed by the situation.  So, what happened was that organizations started, started being inaugurated and initiated and the youngsters would learn about your, your mother, my mother, and the older adults that were concerned so I'd come in my dad's [Walter L. Gordon, Sr.] office on Central Avenue real estate, small office, not one of these great big pretentious offices, but we had--his desk was shiny and varnished and the property was kept up.  And my dad had this innate ability to make a place look like something.  And I would come there at noontime to maybe have an early class and get out early--
Speaker 2: Well, what year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and it would be--
Speaker 2: What year, Mr. Gordon [HistoryMaker Walter L. Gordon, Jr.], would this have been?
Speaker 1: This would be about 1928, '29 [1929].
Story_ID: 461383
Speaker 1: Okay, before we go t- come back up, let's take us back--just a little bit back.  How, how long did you stay at Rose Hill School [Rose Hill Elementary School; Huntington Drive Elementary School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: To graduation, which would be up to twelfth grade.  I'm--
Speaker 1: So it's one school for the whole time?
Speaker 2: For the whole period of time.  And by the way I should add that graduating from grammar school was an event.  There were so many kids dropping out and only--out of a class of thirty or forty, only two or three would go to high school.  And, therefore, when I wrote her [Gordon's principal, Henrietta Glissman] that I was graduating from (unclear)--to Ohio State law school [The Ohio State University College of Law; Michael E. Moritz College of Law, Columbus, Ohio] ten years later, that was almost an astounding historical event because none of the kids were doing it.  There was no one that I've ever found out that even graduated from university when I went to school and I was the only black.
Speaker 1: Tell us about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This, this, this thing was more or less--oh, and during the time that I was at Ohio State, I attracted certain people who heard I'd come all the way across the country to go to Ohio State.  That attracted attention.
Story_ID: 461384
Speaker 1: And it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mr. Gordon [HistoryMaker Walter L. Gordon, Jr.], tell us about your, your, your neighborhood growing up.  That's kind of important to this, your, your neighborhood growing up when you were a kid growing up.  Tell us about your neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Where did you live expe- exactly?
Speaker 1: We lived--when we first moved in and they saw us looking, people paid attention, but I had a--I was--my family was a rather attractive family.  My dad [Walter L. Gordon, Sr.]--my dad--they were clean looking people.  They were people that were intelligent.  They could discuss current events.  And now don't forget, most of the people that you met in those days, white and black, were people who didn't--they hadn't been to school, people who couldn't carry on even a decent conversation, black or white.
Speaker 2: Who were some of your neighbors?  Do you recall any of your neighbors on that street?
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean by name?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Well, when we first moved into town, we moved in--we, we moved into Armour Street [sic. Armour Avenue].  And Armour Street, we--there's--we ran into a family called Page [ph.], poor white and the kind that we usually were regarded as crackers and so forth.  And at first, they didn't speak to us.  And then, my dad bought a house or rented a house near the Pages, then the Pages wanted to move, not because of my family, but the Pages had done better, bought another house and sold the house they were living in to my family who fixed up their house.  And then at the very top of a hill, the hill must've been two blocks high, two blocks high, long, winding road, no cement sidewalks, you walked on a path.  That's where my father and mother [Vertner Lewis Gordon] lived--moved, to the top, very top where the chicken yards and ducks and geese and fig trees and so forth are at the very top of the hill, and we moved up there and stayed there.  And everybody--
Speaker 2: How old were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) called--
Speaker 2: How old were you when that happened?
Speaker 1: Beg your pardon?
Speaker 2: How old were you were then happened?
Speaker 1: I was four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  From then on, I, I lived there until I went away to school.
Story_ID: 461385
Speaker 1: Now, what were some of the sights and the sounds and the smells of that neighborhood?  Can you recall any of the--
Speaker 2: Well, you know very well there were coyotes.  There were animals all around.  When you went to school, you, you run across snakes.  Thank goodness they were not poisonous snakes.  They were gopher snakes.  And the little girls even would be chased by little bad boys with snakes around their neck and they (unclear).  That was--snakes were that plentiful.  There were squirrels.  My father [Walter L. Gordon, Sr.] was enterprising and he was--he would try to fix things himself and he, he would repair a house and he could do all kinds of things.  And he--one of the big jokes was that he went--you would hear screaming of the chickens and so forth at night and on several occasions, my father had gone out and he hadn't properly prepared himself because there were skunks out there, and these skunks would saturate my dad.  And my dad would be stopped at the front--at the back door by my mother [Vertner Lewis Gordon] and he had to pull all these things off that he had on and get these smelly things out and you couldn't let somebody under the house either.  That smell was hell.  And my dad had to go through that.
Story_ID: 461386
Speaker 1: Another incident out there, I told you were at the top of the hill--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and the grass was so slippery that you didn't need lard or grease or anything on the runners 'cause they--that, that grass would send you speeding down the hill.  Don't make a mistake and sit down and get going.  And on one occasion, my father [Walter L. Gordon, Sr.] who I told you had been ill, my father would take his car and go and park it at the top of the hill and go to sleep.  He would go do that because he was ill.  And we had a dog named Joe.  And Joe used to follow my dad everywhere and Joe would be right there.  And on this particular occasion and to cause a big laugh in the community, my dad had bought a second-hand Buick from old man Brody [ph.].  Now, old man Brody was the--one of the black leaders in the town [Los Angeles, California].  He was--he had to do with the lending of money.  He lent money to the workers and he hired them for jobs.  And, by the way, he looked like an old Prussian himself.  I've been telling you about--there were a lot of Prussians up there.  Now, this is not a coincidence.  This is it.  I told you that there was a Schuetzen Park [Rose Hill Park, Los Angeles, California].  Schuetzen is a German park.  Old man Brody must've been related to some of those Germans because he had one eye and he wore one of those monocles and he was a mean old man, and he sold my dad this secondhand car, Buick.  My dad was up there sleeping in that car and Joe in the car with him.  Well, my dad jumped out of the car for something, did something probably, for urination or something, and left Joe in the car.  Joe went looking for my dad, unleashed the brake, and on the crest of this high hill.  So, that Buick automobile tumbled and went sliding down a good almost two long blocks making every (unclear) twist and turn.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And my dad could do nothing but sit there and wait.  And the people came out and approached that car and poor old Joe in it.  So, Joe when he finally got out of it, Joe looked around a few minutes, got the dizziness out of him and then he started running.  Joe ran all the distance back up that mountain, went in the cellar, and from then on, we had hell getting him to come out of the cellar.  Now, when he did finally emerge, he, he would speak to me, he would speak to some of the other members in the family, but when he saw my dad coming (laughter), when he saw my dad coming, he cut out and ran like hell.  And so every time he would see my father going anywhere close to him, he'd start running.  My father got very angry about it and we would stand out there in the yard and address himself to Joe, telling Joe, "You're a crazy old dog and so forth, why don't you get some sense?  You know I didn't do it on purpose."  But Joe paid no attention to his pleading, see?  He remained absolutely frightened of my father.

Speaker 1: What was life like in your family at that time?  Now, did, did, did you have siblings?
Speaker 2: Say what?
Speaker 1: Did you have any siblings, any siblings, brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Siblings.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: No, I was the--I was the only one.  We had miscarriages.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was the only one.  I was regarded as a precious baby.
Speaker 1: What was life like growing up in the house with your father [Walter L. Gordon, Sr.] and mother [Vertner Lewis Gordon]?
Speaker 2: Fine, wonderful family that was just devoted to each other and wonderful, happy home.  My father, I knew he would kill for me, just--they, they--I had a very happy childhood and I was with my father and mother.  I was precocious.  I was not particularly--I think I like myself pretty well, I'm very confident because I had so much advanced--there was so much favorable treatment at home, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kind of student were you?  Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: I was a--I was not a starring student, but I could do everything and I was the top of my class, but I never did as well as I was capable of doing.  And I, I can say this, that I don't care who you are as a kid, as say from five to fifteen, I don't think I know any kid who didn't have--who had as much experience and just being let alone and do what wanted to do.  When I look back now and see what I did as a kid, I wonder where my father and mother were, but they must've had a world of confidence in me because my--they wouldn't worry about me.

Speaker 1: I would get on the railroad track.  I would hobo.  I used to grab the, the train, get on a train and talk with the old hoboes.  I would go to towns like Sacramento [California] and I would work picking peaches.
Speaker 2: Now, now this is all by yourself?
Speaker 1: I had a buddy.
Speaker 2: His name?
Speaker 1: And, he, he had a more sense than I did and I guess I regarded him as my father.
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: Tommy Myles [Thomas W. Myles, Jr.].  Tommy Myles.  Tommy Myles was a man of many youngster, about two years older than I am.  And when I reached high school, 19--it was around 1922, when I reached high school, his, Tommy Myles, name was everywhere on the school as school leader.  He was a little moriney [ph.] looking Negro, short, bow-legged, bad yellow hair, beautiful speaker, and was a member of the Lincoln High School [Abraham Lincoln High School, Los Angeles, California] state record 220-yard dash team, could run like a deer.  So, I--that was my hero.  And Tommy Myles, well, he would be very quick to suggest we do something and I would be inspired and think it's a good thing to do like going to Sacramento.  We--in the summertime, they paid well for pears, apricots, peaches, and he would suggest going up there and stay and make some money.  He could make a--paint a beautiful picture of making money.  And I was sucker enough to follow him and I would go up there and he'd not show up.  Therefore, I would be there and he'd be writing, talking about he's on his way.  And so he did that on one occasion.  He sold me going to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So, therefore, I wanted to go to Harvard anyway, so I wrote to Harvard.  So much--it was so impressive that I got an answer back from the chairman of admissions at Harvard University complementing me on my spirit but nevertheless not admitting me.  And I, I had already made arrangements, so I got on a freighter and--called the Luckenbach Line.  I went up to San Francisco [California], caught a freighter, went back--there were some other things, too, that caused me to go.  That wasn't wholly the reason, but I went back and started living in Boston [Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 461389
Speaker 1: Now let's go forward.  Let's go back and then go forward.  So, your senior year of high school [University of Southern California Preparatory School, Los Angeles, California], this occurred around your junior or senior as you're getting ready to graduate, what plans did you have at that point around your senior year, junior year of high school?
Speaker 2: You--now, you want to know what prompted me to--
Speaker 1: Right.  What, what were your plans?  Were you looking to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I--
Speaker 1: --looking to go to college?
Speaker 2: I was just impressed by the fact that, that Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] was great and the world champion broad jumper was there.  I loved athletics.
Speaker 1: Were you an athlete yourself in high school?
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: Were you an athlete?
Speaker 2: I was good but not a star.  I was very ordinary.  I could run.  But I'm running with the stars.  Consequently, that discouraged me because it was so easy for them.  Now, Tommy Myles [ph.], he got addressed and talked about all over the world.  Then, there was somebody else I wanted--oh, Ned Gourdin [Edward Gourdin] was the champion--world champion broad jumper.  He had the world record.  He lived in Boston [Massachusetts].  So, I, I got to hear about him.  The great--at Harvard University, there was a black man--and don't forget, there are very few blacks in school not alone this stars on teams.  This man's name was Hamp Lewis [William Henry Lewis], probably one of the greatest athletes Harvard ever had.  Now, please mark what I'm saying.  I'm not saying he was great, I'm saying great, ever had.  He was in every, every event.  He was tops.  He set all kinds of records.  And he was so good that when he graduated, they made him U.S. attorney.  And he was so good there, they had him come up and lecture the legislature at the--Massachusetts.  And they all called him Hamp.  Well, you never dream there was any man that was gonna be any greater than Hamp.  And I got to meet those fellows and I, I got to know the guys.  I, I was a follower.  I did--I'd meet them and Hamp Lewis, let's see, who else was there?  Oh, I found out that, for instance, there were all these kids at the school, at the various schools around there.  They had Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], you had Harvard, you had Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and the, the kids--there were so few kids that what few were there, everybody knew very well, every--so, there was--this man, Hamp, he had a daughter.  Well, her--she was very well known because she became very popular.  I remember a woman who was a singer there named Thelma Bird [ph.].  She was a wonderful singer.  And it was New England--there, there was a conservative, New England Conservatory [New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Massachusetts] of something like that.
Speaker 1: Of music, yes.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) the greatest school across the country.  And that's when Weaver [Robert C. Weaver], the man became secretary of labor [sic. secretary of housing and urban development] or something, I forgot now.  But, those were the guy--oh, it was--and two schools that you had Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts]--that Amherst received a lot of attention.  You don't hear about Amherst anymore.  And, so here I am in the midst of all these guys and I was just thrilled to death.  And this--on Sundays, everybody would go to a place called 556 Massachusetts Avenue.
Story_ID: 461390
Speaker 1: Now, tell us how you got to Boston [Massachusetts] because you were in high school and then you graduated from high school.  Did you go straight to Boston at that point or--?
Speaker 2: I, I graduated--see, what happened--
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: --I graduated from high school (unclear)--that's right, went straight back east and--but I was--another thing motivated me, I was more or less in love with Miss Bass [Charlotta Bass] of the California Eagle's, niece [Madeline Johnson (ph.)].  She was a beautiful girl from Providence, Rhode Island, 32 Broom Street, that's where she lived.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: She--I took her to all her affairs here and I went to high--I went to high school at USC [University of Southern California Preparatory School, Los Angeles, California].  So, I'm there on the campus at USC in high school because the teachers at US- the, the students at USC, when they were in--they were taking an education course, they allowed them to practice teach at the high school.
Speaker 1: Now, now was this a special program you were in?  Because you said you went to Rose Hill [Rose Hill Elementary School; Huntington Drive Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] until the twelfth grade.  Was, was this a special program along with Rose Hill?  You went to US--
Speaker 2: They had a high--they had more than a special program.  They had a school of education.  And in the school of education, they had incorporated a high school called USC high school.  Therefore, if you went to USC high school, you were on the campus at USC.
Speaker 1: And still be in Rose Hill at the same time?
Speaker 2: And be what?
Speaker 1: And still be at the Rose Hill School, too, at the same time?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, I mean after graduation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After graduation from grammar school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you go to--you go to a university.  Now, in the university, you--now, you, you want to go to university--wait a minute, I'm mixed up.
Speaker 1: You said you went to--
Speaker 2: I think you caught something there.
Speaker 1: --Rose Hill to--Rose Hill, Rose Hill was probably the sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Rose Hill--I went on--no, Rose Hill, in those days, you went to grammar school, you went to the twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so that's, that's all the way through high school.  Twelfth grade is the end of the high school.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So then, what--so then, something happened after that?
Speaker 2: After that, I wanted to go--I, I wanted to--hold it a minute.  Let's see.
Story_ID: 461391
Speaker 1: --Now, tell us that story, please.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: The money in the road, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: All right.  I got--should I go now?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I used to go--there was a forest of pine trees, big pine trees all around Schuetzen Park [California].  The war [World War I, WWI] was on and in this park, there were about ten big donkeys or jackass and they were bad.  And I'm one of these little gutsy guys with a couple buddies who wanted to ride some of those jackass.  So, we go in there and we get up in the tree, we didn't have any sense, get in a tree, try to chase these donkeys, the jackasses, towards the trees to come out, to come onto the tree so we could hop on the tree.  If it have happened we'd have all been killed because these were bad donkeys.  We didn't know what we were doing.  But, the, the man, the gardener, the German fellows that were watching the trees and the house and all that, took a liking to us and told us what could happen to us.  And we respected him.  So, what he did, he pointed to me, he says, "You want a job?"  I said, "Yes."  He favored me somewhat because the United States was kind of angry at Germany and Germany was angry at the United States, so he favored me and he said, all right.  He said you come Sunday.  And the Germans would bowl on Sundays.  So, I got there and, and I got to be the master of the bowling alley, no, nothing electric, you had to bend down and pick them up and set them, bend them down, and you better know how to do it fast.
Speaker 1: Pin setting, is that--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Pin setting?  You had to set the pins?
Speaker 2: Set--I set--you had to set the pins yourself.  Let's see, what would we do now?  You get the pins in this machine so then, boom, you let them down.  Anyway, so I, I worked at this bowling alley and the Germans began to like me.  And so they would have special occasions where they didn't want--they--the ordinary Germans to appear and they wanted me to be there because I, I was trusted.  So, they'd be drunk as hell.  That's another reason they wanted me.  They wanted me to take care of them and so forth.  But, to get to this Schuetzen Park, it would be from here to--you would have to--from, from here almost to Western Avenue [Los Angeles, California] to walk, and dirt roads, and they were drunk.  And we don't think about automobiles.  They--you, you walk, and all these people working.
Story_ID: 461392
Speaker 1: I was going to work back up in the park [Schuetzen Park, California] and I kicked something with my foot and it was dollar bills, ten dollar bills, and quite a bit of money.  Now, don't forget, when you, you got a dollar, that was--that was money.  So, it was at least, almost one hundred dollars I found.  And I kicked it up and found some more money and found some more money.  And you don't--I didn't know whether somebody--maybe somebody was drunk and they buried the money.  So, my dad [Walter L. Gordon, Sr.] always liked to follow me when I'd go somewhere and he'd always be there when I get in, and the first thing he said, "How much did you get?"  Because I was very lucky at finding money.  So, my dad asked me, told me where and I gave it to him, and he says, "Let's go back down there."  So, we went back down there and we came away not--I'm not trying to make this look like a whole lot of money, but we came away with maybe twenty or thirty more dollars, but we got less than two hundred but no--so forth.  So, the--let me see, now I, I can tell I'm getting ready to forget.  So, we got that money and--isn't it something?  My mind went.
Speaker 2: That's okay.  So you--so you got the money.
Speaker 1: All right.  I got that money and--but, oh, I know.  We, we got the money, my dad took it, and--anyway, I, I was--let me come back to it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we can come back to that.  So--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But, nevertheless, we found all this money.  And another incident very much like it was--that's, that's the first time I had this happen.
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Story_ID: 461393
Speaker 1: Just tell us in general now, I'm noticing that you, you are in a situation where you're experiencing a lot of things.  Now, America is very racist at this time and blacks are regarded in different lights then, than they are now.  What was--what was L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and Pasadena [California] and that area like for, for the average black person?
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up with those white folk and those white folk, each one--each one was different.  Some of them were good to you, nice to you, others were rough.  Some just don't pay any--didn't pay any attention to you.  And I had a--I guess everyone I met was a different experience, and I--I'd have to really know them to understand how to behave.  And it made you realize that you had two eyes.  You had one eye for prejudice, you had another eye for niceness, and you learned to live and adjust to whatever you saw, but you were very conscious at certain times and very relaxed at others.  You get to know the other race.  I believe it gave blacks almost an advantage in that they were very sensitive about how another person felt or thought about you, so that's number one.  And there were some white people that were just wonderful and then there were others that were son of a bitches.  And the, the--I imagine they regarded you that way.  But, I would run into, oh, some very tough experiences, like--
Story_ID: 461394
Speaker 1: I went to--Tommy [Thomas W. Myles, Jr.] and I went up to San Francisco [California]--
Speaker 2: Now, now, now Tommy is your friend from school.  What school is this that you met Tommy?
Speaker 1: I was--this is--this is vacation time.
Speaker 2: Okay, now but you were out of school?  Now, you were at--
Speaker 1: Out of school.
Speaker 2: You were--you--so you had graduated from Rose Hill [Rose Hill Elementary School; Huntington Drive Elementary School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Graduated from Rose Hill.
Speaker 2: And, and you--and you went where after Rose Hill?
Speaker 1: Went--Rose Hill, the next one was Lincoln High School [Abraham Lincoln High School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Okay.  And that--and that's where you met Tommy.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Then I--and I learned about Tommy.  I didn't know the first thing about Tommy except he was from, from Boyle Heights [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, also, I found out that athletics was a bit much more appreciated thing over in Boyle Heights' way than where I'd come from.  Athletics was not a big thing from Rose Hill [Los Angeles, California], but in Boyle Heights in those schools over there, their programs were advanced and those little Boyle Heights kids could do almost everything.  Well, anyway, the--
Speaker 2: Sacramento [California] you were telling (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On the school ground when I arrived there, the--Tommy Myles was everything.  They didn't believe in, in blacks in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  No blacks were in the ROTC.  Then, all of the sudden, I discovered that Tommy was so great that the school's big problem was, what are we gonna do with him?  He is supposed to be the major, the top man in the whole ROTC system.  He was known as (unclear) on the army tactics and things than the officers themselves.  And he, he reached the point where he was able to carry--I don't know what this means, but he had a--he had a pistol and everything, and here he was in high school and everybody respected him.  So, they compromised.
Speaker 2: How much older was he than you?  Was he the same age or?
Speaker 1: Not more than three, four years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, so I saw him.  I was--I remember telling this about--I remember him being nominated--he was at least the highest guy there on the camp- at, at Lincoln High School and, and they respected him.  And then, how he became--this is something that all old people who were around will know about.  He gained a reputation at sixteen, seventeen, eighteen that everybody knew of him.  He was--he publicized his own publicity campaign.  He became the president of the Boys International Club of the World [ph.].  There was no such organization.  He created it.  He had news releases on that.  He was that far advanced that he convinced the various journalists that he was this great figure.  And then, it was discovered it was purely a fiction.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: He would--there was no such club and there was no such president. And--but in the meanwhile, he had established this reputation.
Story_ID: 461395
Speaker 1: Ministers loved him because he would--could get up and give them a--give a wonderful spiel and the minister would suggest that he needed help to go to school, and the young man there with him would--was Walter Gordon [HistoryMaker Walter L. Gordon, Jr.] and he's one of his friends who was loyal enough to come up here with him, one of those deals.  And the minister would give Tommy [Thomas W. Myles, Jr.] some of the collection money, and Tommy would be tickled to death.  All the ministers loved Tommy.  Then, the--Tommy as a youngster now--and we'd go to Wesley Church, Wesley [Wesley Methodist Episcopal Church, Los Angeles, California], 8th [Street] and San Julian [Street].  We'd go to church and Tommy would drive up there with the mayor's automobile with the mayor's chauffer with Tommy's little girl.  I remember the girl now and everything.  But, we're talking about Bessie Burke [Bessie Bruington Burke].  Remember Bessie Burke, the first black principal?  Bessie Burke looked kind of rough and tough and she had muscle and could knock a man out.  But her little--her sister was a doll, pretty--the prettiest gal and I--you wouldn't think they came from the same womb.  Anyway, that little gal would be sitting up there with Tommy and they'd be going to Wesley Church and the chauffer would wait for them.  Now, this is the kind of in that he had with the mayor.  And, now, from that position on, Tommy lost out with the general public, but the police department special heads knew he had potential.  So, he is--was a bag man, became a bag man for Sweetman [ph.].  Do you remember Sweetman?
Speaker 2: No, sir, but go ahead and tell us about that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Sweetman was a white captain of police put in charge of the vice squad on central and, and in Eastside [Los Angeles, California] and became an affiliate of some of our black politicians.  So, Sweetman would have, have his special force, and Tommy was to it.  So, Tommy was a very instrumental people in the things that were happening on the Eastside.  That--well, that's just breaking the iceberg.  How much more do you want?
Speaker 2: No, we can go ahead.  So, so, anyway, you, you meet Tommy at the school in Lincoln [Abraham Lincoln High School, Los Angeles, California], he's very popular you said.
Speaker 1: All right.  That all right with you?
Speaker 2: Okay, now, so you meet Tommy, now you're at Lincoln.  When do you go to USC [University of Southern California Preparatory School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: When do you go to USC?
Speaker 1: I went to USC after I came back from Boston [Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 461396
Speaker 1: Now when did you go to Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I went to Boston about--it was around '24 [1924], '25 [1925], '26 [1926].
Speaker 1: Why did you go to Boston?
Speaker 2: Went to Boston because of the fact that, first of all, I was in love with Mrs. Bass' [Charlotta Bass] niece.
Speaker 1: Mrs. Bass is--
Speaker 2: Who--
Speaker 1: --who now?
Speaker 2: That was (unclear) California Eagle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, she's the most sought after woman, subject, probably of all subjects.  She's the one that operated the lone California Eagle, fought so many battles for blacks here and she, she--her niece was named Madeline Johnson [ph.] who lived in Providence, Rhode Island, 32 Broom Street in Providence.  She came here to finish her university training.  She's already been started at the university back east.  So, here I am.  I was older--I was as old as she was but I was not, not in the grade she was.  I had difficulty in high school.  And that's the reason that I switched from Lincoln High School [Abraham Lincoln High School, Los Angeles, California] to USC Prep School [University of Southern California Preparatory School, Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to get around the--some of those restrictions I had run into.  Oh, my restriction and my trouble was, I lived in Schuetzen Park [Rose Hill Park, Los Angeles, California].  Schuetzen Park was from here to Vermont Avenue away and a long hill.  I rode--I had to go to school on a bicycle, and pumping up that damn high school--that high hill just wore me out.  And I'd sleep late and they had a woman named Miss Bridge [ph.] who was the school attendance office at Lincoln High School.  When--they locked the doors down at five minutes after school, so that meant you had to go to the attendance office.  And when you went to the attendance office, they gave you demerits.  Now, when they gave you those demerits, if you had so many demerits, you couldn't graduate, you had to earn additional classes.  And I got so many of them, I just--I found out, just go on over to another school.  My folks [Vertner Lewis Gordon and Walter L. Gordon, Sr.] were willing to pay for it.  We barely could make it, but we did it, and I started working.
Story_ID: 461397
Speaker 1: All right, now, there's something else about--in Boston [Massachusetts]--when I got back to New York [New York], I--this girl and I--
Speaker 2: So, wait, but you met her here?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: The young lady, the young lady from Rhode Island, you met her here in town [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 1: I met her here--
Speaker 2: Okay, tell us more about that.
Speaker 1: --where--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --where she lived with Miss Bass [Charlotta Bass].  You--every, every attention to past performances, you'll run into Miss Bass.  Well, she lived with Mrs. Bass.  She had a color consciousness.  She had a--she was not quite ready to stay over this way.  She--what she did was she promised me she'd meet me back there, we'd go to school back there.  I'll try to get in Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] some more or Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  And when I got back there--oh, by the way, to get back there, I took a boat and I worked on the Andrew Luckenbach [Andrew F. Luckenbach].  I think it was Andrew.  So, that was nine days to the Panama Canal, nine days from Panama Canal to New York.  So, I took that.  I go up to her house expecting to be given a loving hello and there even be--and Mrs. Bass had gone back there in the meanwhile on a trip.  And Mrs. Bass came to the door, oh, Madeline [Madeline Johnson (ph.)], I don't know where she is.  And, boy, it's snow and ice there and I'm sitting there on her front waiting to see this girlfriend, and I never did get to see her, never saw her again in life.  This is a real shock to me at that age where--
Speaker 2: How old were you?
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.  Blew.  I feel it was gonna blow.  Battery gone.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 461398
Speaker 1: So you're, you're there now in Providence, Rhode Island--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on the front porch.
Speaker 2: No, that's in New- Brooklyn, New York.
Speaker 1: In Brooklyn, New York, okay.
Speaker 2: That the girl [Madeline Johnson (ph.)] had left Los Angeles [California], had gone back to Brooklyn, hadn't gone back to her home in Providence.  So, she was supposed to be there in Brooklyn.  And so Mrs. Bass [Charlotta Bass] comes to the door, Mrs. Bass is from here, that's where we were all gonna meet.  And I guess what they did, they decided that she was to leave the race and I have never seen her since.  And Mrs. Bass says she's never seen her, but I, I figured she had.
Speaker 1: So as you say leave the race, she was fair enough where she could pass?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And she--I--and then I checked with other relatives who have come from Brooklyn and from Providence and it's a close family, and no one know where she is.  They at least tell me that.  So, they evidently thought I was pretty well smitten and therefore maybe couldn't stand the news, and so that's what happened there.
Speaker 1: So, so what did you do?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: So, what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: Well, I--first place, I didn't give up.  I went on to, to--I went--first, I went to Providence, Rhode Island, to 32 Broom Street, and then no news, nobody knew anything, but it looked like a closed thing.  I went to Boston [Massachusetts], and in Boston, I went up to the Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Mr. Pennypacker [Henry Pennypacker], the admission man, when he found out it was me from California and he had a reference letter there where he had correspondence with me turning me down, he says, "What brought you here and why?  This is something."  And he said, "You mean you came around on the Panama Canal?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "How old are you?"  And I told him.  He says, "Well, this is something."  He says, "No, we have a rule.  Your grades did not warrant you being admitted and, but I am gonna look out for you."  And he says, "Where are you stopping?"  And I told him and he says, "Well, you come with me, you're gonna have a place to stay and I'm gonna take you over here to--this is something, now.  You take it here, we're going over to the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in Boston."  Took me over to the YMCA in Boston, told the people in there about me, that I had come through the canal and the man gave me a room.
Speaker 1: Now, was this unusual, you being an African American young male, have went to Boston (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, but I'll tell you what was very strong there were the Puerto Ricans.  And it happened that I kind of fit in with the Puerto Ricans and maybe they didn't notice it at first.  But anyway, the man--the secretary of the YMCA gave me a room.
Story_ID: 461399
Speaker 1: So, now I'm like a rooster then walking around in Boston [Massachusetts].  I want to see everything, and the main street in Boston was--for transit trade, was Tremont [Street].  And it was raining weather and on the streetcars as you, you see, the, the guys coming from work hanging on the, the, the--that was wartime.  That's--because I'm thinking about how the guys were hanging on the outside on these cars going down Tremont Street or Massachusetts Avenue, could be Massachusetts Avenue.  But, they had--there was a women's clubhouse on Massachusetts Avenue that, that everybody, all the women, school women, visited on Sunday.  They had meetings just like the forum [Los Angeles Forum] here.  So, the number--they didn't call it by the street number, they said, "556," and they wouldn't say women's clubhouse, say, "We're going to 556."  So, I got a job, but I must tell you first that--yeah, after going down there, I ran into a lot of guys (unclear) boys and then we got in a debate and they all knew I was from California.  And then they asked me where I was stopping.  I told them YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  They bucked their eyes at me and as if to say, he's lying.  He--he's lying.  And they said--they ended up saying, "Can you take us over there?  We, we, we want to see your room."
Speaker 2: Because they didn't believe you?
Speaker 1: No.  So, I, not knowing what it was all about said, "Sure."  So, we all went over to the YMCA.  I went to the room and after the, the boys had left, they all expressed amazement, the man told me, "I'm sorry, Mr. Gordon [HistoryMaker Walter L. Gordon, Jr.], we did not know you were black and you have to leave."  We have to--and they, they got in touch with a young woman whose husband was a doctor.  He went to Tufts University [Tufts College; Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts].  And, do you know anything about Boston?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir, I do.
Speaker 1: He went to Tufts.  His name was Malcolm Proctor, Proctor [ph.].  By the way that's the first time I have been able to remember that number.  I--when you get a certain scene--but I've never been able to remember his number.  So, Proctor called his home and he told me--he offered me--they offered me to stop at a doctor's home, Dr. T.E.A. McCurley [ph.].  He's West Indian and he, he let me have a room in his house and I got a job, and doctor--and then Dr. McCurley--oh, my mother [Vertner Lewis Gordon] got in touch with Dr. McCurley.  They became great friends for years.

Speaker 1: So, is that--was that common in that day for other black professionals to take in young b- young men who were trying to do things to--
Speaker 2: Evidently, yes.
Speaker 1: --to help them out?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they would correspond and I got a job as a wringer in a laundry and it was a lot of Spanish women or Puerto Rican women, and I was--they packed those things in and wring them.  And I remember then they sent me out on window cleaning and--in people's private homes in all the little towns around.  I got that.  They were writing up, you keep the, the initial fee that they paid for joining a--for signing up to a book or a magazine, and it made you a nice little living.  And they had a black guy in charge of the group.  I didn't see any other members of the group but a guy named Campbell [ph.] who became a big figure back east, but that's the man I worked for.  And I would go to the--catch the (unclear) and go to these little towns.  And I--to, to further verify, it was a, a sailor who was--became the mayor of the town and he was a big man.  It ended up, though, my job played out, wintertime was coming, and it's cold as hell.  And, so, I went on down to the boat yard.  I went to, to the naval place and the first mate told me--I told him what had happened and he says, "Well, you can--you can have officers' mess."  So, I--now, don't forget, I had a little experience on the other boat [Andrew F. Luckenbach] coming.  I don't--they let me go one place and I think that was the trip when I first got on.  They had--oh, I know.  When I got that first boat ride, I bluffed my way.  I didn't know the first thing about mess and they put me on officers' mess.  And when they found out--I made a mistake with some corn.  Instead of taking the damn corn cob and throwing it in the (unclear), I sent this cob back upstairs where it was still on the plate, you get my point?  Without disposing of it.  And the mate then came and gave me hell and told me to come on down with me and he put me down in, in sailors' mess.  And, of course, I was a tough baby.  The team--the, the guys that I had to serve was a football team, practically.  Lafayette [Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania] won the national game thing.  I, I, I haven't heard of it since, but it was Lafayette, and all these ex-football players are tough babies and so forth.  But I--that was that experience--
Speaker 1: Part of that--
Speaker 2: Then I came home--
