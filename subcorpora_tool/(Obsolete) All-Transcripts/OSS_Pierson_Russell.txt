 Gill. Today is September 1, 2010. I   m visiting with  Russell Pierson here at the state fairgrounds in Oklahoma City. This  interview is for the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. Russell, I appreciate you taking time away  from your business today to visit with us.  Well, it   s my pleasure.  You   ve got a long history with Oklahoma State University. We want to  talk about that, but I   d like to back up for a minute and talk about your  early life, where you grew up, your family. Can you share some of that  information? Where did you grow up, Russell?  On a farm three miles north of Mangum, down in Greer County.  Did you go to high school in Mangum?  Yes. First of all, I went to a little one-room country school. My mother  started me in school when I was four years old, and then she held me  back a grade so I   d be with my cousins who are a grade behind me. And  the rest of the time, Mangum schools until I went to Oklahoma A   M.  Do you have any brothers and sisters?  I   ve got one sister; she   s four years older than I am. That   s the extent of  the family.  Were there any community activities or high school activities you were  involved in? Were you in sports?  In high school?  5  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Yes, sir.  Well, of course, like most country kids, I was pretty active in sports. I  played left end on the football team at Mangum my junior and senior  year. I was pretty vicious. I know the tackles that opposed me were  scared because I weighed 135 pounds. I was pretty fast on my feet. I  could sort of get out of their way. On defense, I played halfback (that   s  what they called it then: defensive halfback) because I could jump pretty  high and knock down passes or intercept them, whatever the case might  be. And I was on the track team. That was my main sport, was track.  Were you a sprinter or a distance runner?  I was distance. Well, I ran everything you needed to run, but mainly I  was a distance runner, especially the half mile and the mile. We didn   t  have the two mile back in those days, in high school. I guess I won my  share of them.  Russell, were you in 4-H or FFA?  4-H. I had a good county agent. I never did really set the world on fire,  but I was active enough that he was out at our farm quite a little bit. His  name was Roy Georgia.  What was your specialty? Did you show cattle or crops or     Cotton. Cotton was the main thing. We always had, as did most country  boys, our dad would usually give us an acre to ten acres of cotton that  was ours. Sold it. Actually, soil conservation, I guess, in 4-H was my  main activity. We ran a lot of terrace lines on farms around Greer  County.  Russell, were your parents the first people to farm that after it was open  for settlement?  My grandfather settled on   they brought a little wagon train in, about  eight or ten wagons, from down in Eastland County, Texas, and settled  there on Elm River north of Mangum. Of course, he, like all country  boys, back in those days, was involved in cattle. He got in on one pretty  good size cattle drive as a cowboy. After that he was a farmer.  Are there some values and principles you learned growing up on the  farm with your family?  Well, we   ve got a long history in the Baptist church there in Mangum.  My grandfather and grandmother were charter members of the First  6  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Baptist Church there at Mangum. We were church people. Sometimes  we didn   t get to go to church because we lived out in the country, and if  it was raining, why, you didn   t go.  I guess you learned about hard work and discipline working out on the  farm?  I know what it is to have blisters on my hands, yes.  How many acres were you farming, quarter section or larger?  Actually, when my parents got married, they bought eighty acres that my  great-grandmother had settled on. We always worked the rented land,  too, to fill it out. We generally were operating 160 to 200 acres.  You were talking about Oklahoma A   M earlier. What influenced you  to go to school at Oklahoma A   M? I mean, that   s a long ways from  Mangum to Stillwater.  It is, especially if you   re hitchhiking, which was our mode of travel.  (Laughter) Well, I   ll tell you why   if we   ve got time. I don   t know how  much time you want to use on this, but the year I graduated from high  school, I   d been pretty active in athletics, especially in track, and I also  was in the glee club and the quartet. I sang bass in the quartet in high  school. Coming home, Dad and I had been to town with a load of  something; I don   t remember what it was. Coming back, he said,    Son,     we were in a wagon, a farm wagon. He said,    I know you want to be an  athletic coach. You   re going to go up to A   M here in a couple of  weeks, but, if I had my choice, I   d like to see you training to be what  Mr. Georgia is.    Well, Mr. Georgia was our county agent. I said,    No, I  want to be an athletic coach.     Well, I went up to A M and enrolled in science and literature with  physical education as a major, and I stayed with that about two weeks,  but what my dad had told me just kept ringing in my ears.    Son, I   d like  to see you be what Mr. Georgia is. You   d still be working with boys, but  you   d do us farmers a lot of help.    So, two weeks after I enrolled up  there, I switched majors and went over to agriculture. I   ve never been  regretful of it. That was good advice my father gave me.  What year was it that you enrolled?  Nineteen twenty-nine. September, 1929.  Was your work with 4-H and the farm sort of your influence to go to  Oklahoma State University, or did somebody encourage you to go to  7  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Oklahoma A   M?  Well, that encouraged me some, yes, but I was so predominant  especially in track in high school, that I had my mind made up about  being an athletic coach. But I guess you don   t take the country out of a  country boy.  Where did you live on campus?  Room 204, Hanner Hall. It was a brand new hall, real nice. In fact, it  was a very convenient spot. I was right across the hall from the  bathroom. (Laughter)  Do you remember your roommate?  My first roommate was a boy from Mangum. His name was Winter  McReynolds, and then later on, a boy from over in eastern Oklahoma at  Boynton, John Crooch was my roommate, and he was also my best man  at my wedding.  You were talking about earlier you had to hitchhike to get home. Did  you get to go home very often?  No, we didn   t because we had to hitchhike. You didn   t have money  enough to ride the bus. We hitchhiked. Sometimes it took us a little  better than a day to get there from Stillwater to Mangum, but coming  back was pretty good because we could catch what we called the film  truck that delivered film every night to the county seats between  Oklahoma City and Mangum. We   d catch him about midnight and ride  back to Oklahoma City, and then hitchhike home to Stillwater the next  day. (Laughter) That was usually our route. After my sophomore year, I  had to lay out one semester because I didn   t have money enough to get  back up there and enroll. I got a job with the agronomy department  because that   s where I was going to major.  In the fall of 1929, is that when you said you enrolled?  I enrolled first of all in the fall of    29.  What was the campus like in 1929? What buildings do you remember?  Could you describe what the campus was like?  It had quite a few buildings. Well, to a country boy like me, they had a  lot of buildings. They had the Morrill Hall and Hanner Hall and the old  Crutchfield Hall, which was a boys    dormitory. They had the Animal  Science Building and the Dairy Building. Whitehurst Hall. Jesse  8  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Thatcher Hall, which is where the girls stayed, and Gardner Hall, which  was a girls    dormitory, too. And the auditorium. And Old Central, of  course, lands sakes, yes, Old Central. That was about it. Engineering  Building.  What buildings were most of your classes held in?  Whitehurst Hall, most of them. I had one class in the Dairy Building,  and I had two or three classes over in the Animal Husbandry Building.  So, most of your classes were in Whitehurst Hall?  Most of them were in Whitehurst Hall.  That   s interesting, because that is now the administration building. Back  then it was classes.  Yes.  What do you remember about Theta Pond? What was Theta Pond like  then? Was it anything like it looks like today?  Theta Pond was in existence. It was kind of a lovers    place, which I  didn   t get to go to very much until 1933 when the time came to elect the  royalty of the Department of Agriculture. A bunch of us old kids who  couldn   t afford to belong to a fraternity got together and decided we  were going to run a candidate for Aggie Princess, which was the same as  Aggie Queen. We did. Our chief competition was the girl that worked in  the Dean of Agriculture   s office, a student. In those days, professors  could vote on the Aggie Princess, the same as the students, which most  of them did, and you know where the vote was cast. But we won by five  votes. (Laughter) Close race. So, my blonde-headed girl who was the  candidate, Bernice Strom, was the Aggie Queen, or Aggie Princess,  whichever you wish to call it, in 1933. So, after that, we visited Theta  Pond occasionally, yes.  (Laughs) Well, now I   ve got to get the rest of the story. Did you know  Bernice before you ran her for queen, and had you all been dating or  anything?  Well, yes, I knew her before   I didn   t know her before she started  school. I was a junior when she started school in the fall of    32, and she  was from a wheat and cattle farm over near Perry, so we had some  things in common, and besides that, she was a beautiful blue-eyed  blonde. I wouldn   t say it was love at first sight, but, boy, it sure was  attraction at first sight, and romance developed after that. We had three  9  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  years of romance before we got married. Her daddy had told her, he  said,    Now, girls sometimes get married kind of early. If I send you to A    M, you   ve got to promise to teach school two years before you get  married.    So, she did. She got a one-room schoolhouse five miles from  her home, and she taught school two years. School was out on Friday,  and there was a wedding on Sunday. (Laughter)  Wonderful  Do you recall Dr. Bennett? President Henry G. Bennett had  just been there about a year.  Yes, Henry G. Bennett.  What do you remember about Dr. Bennett?  I remember that he was a very considerate, concerned individual. He  really had the students    interest at heart. I didn   t get too personally well  acquainted with him, though he knew my name, which I appreciated.  But to everybody it was    Dr. Bennett.    Dr. Bennett was in charge of the  school. We all respected him and loved him.  Now, you said your background was Baptist, growing up in Mangum.  Dr. Bennett taught Sunday school class.  He was a Baptist, too.  Did you ever attend any of his Sunday school classes?  I never was in his class in Sunday school. He taught Sunday school  some.  Who was the dean of the College of Agriculture at that time?  Carl Blackwell.  For whom Lake Carl Blackwell is named after?  Yes. The man the lake is named after, yes. He was a good dean.  What do you remember about Dean Blackwell?  I remember that if you wanted an audience with Dr. Blackwell, you  could get it. He was concerned about the ag students.  Going from president to dean to professors, do you remember some of  the professors you had that were an influence on your development?  10  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Oh, yes. There   s more than one. Hi W. Stayton is the principle one that I  think was an influence. He was coach of the crops judging team.  What was his name again?  Hi, H-I, Hi. Hi W. Stayton. He was a professor in the agronomy  department, which we called Field Crops and Soils at that time. He was  our coach of the crops judging team. We were a fairly successful   I was  on the team. In fact, I placed fourth highest individual in the national  contest, which was held in Chicago. We had second, fourth, and sixth  place individuals, yet our team score only brought our team second.  Nebraska beat us ten points out of a total of 3,600 points, but we were  pleased.  That   s great.  Other professors you asked about would be Dr. L.L.  Louis Lucian   Ligon, who was in charge of the cotton research, and I worked for him.  Did you say Dr. Higgin?  Dr. Ligon. Dr. L.L. Ligon. By the way, the entomology   Hickson.  Hickson was another real good professor, as was Dr.  William  Craft,  who was a genetics prof over in the Animal Husbandry Building.  Do you remember who the Dean of Men was at that time?  McElroy.  Dean Mac.  Yes, Dean Mac  Clarence Hamilton McElroy .  Did you get to know Dean Mac?  Not personally, because I behaved myself. (Laughter)  You didn   t get called on the carpet, huh?  Some of the boys got pretty well acquainted with him. (Laughter) Dean  Mac was a fine guy.  Russell, can you share some highlights of the time you were a student at  Oklahoma State? For example, you talked about track. You ran track at  Oklahoma State, is that right?  11  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Yes. I made the cross country team, and I made the track team as a  distance runner. In those days, cross country was five miles. If it can be  said without any boasting, as a freshman, I outran the entire varsity   team  except the number-one man. And as a result of that, the varsity  team said,    Russell, there   s a run over at Tulsa that you ought to go to.        Oh,    I said,    I   m not up to that.    They said,    We think you can win it.     So, I caught a bus and went over to Tulsa to the Tulsa Run. They called  it the Five Mile Marathon. I was a country kid. I was scared to death  because that was a big event. Well, my plan was,    I   m going to make a  pretty fast first mile. See how many follow me.    So, I hit up a pretty  good lick in the first mile, and there were a few there with me, but I just  kept up the pace. Got the Loving Cup.  First place.  First place, yes.  Were freshmen eligible to run with varsity?  Freshmen could not run on the varsity  team ; you had a freshman team  of your own. But to finish more of what you asked me, freshmen did get  to compete in the conference. We were in the Missouri Valley  Conference. They had what they called the telegraphic meet. Coach  would pick a day, and everything had to be done on that day. The final  result was, at the Missouri Valley Freshman Conference meet, I came in  second in the half mile, second in the mile, and out in front on the two  mile. I won the two mile.  For a freshman, that   s pretty good.  But I was only competing against freshmen. I won a few varsity. I  finished in the    also ran    in a good many of the races, too. Out of the  money.  During your varsity years, who was some of your main competition?  Well, the top man was named Alan Jenkins. He was good. He won the  two mile in the Drake relays and some of the other big meets. Brian  Thompson was the captain of the cross country team the year I was a  sophomore. We won the Missouri Valley that year. A boy named Taylor  Lane, who finally became a highway patrolman here in Oklahoma. And  a boy from Kansas, Bill Meador, was also on the cross country team.  Who were some of the other schools that you competed against that were  your main competition?  12  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  You mean in the conference?  In the conference, and just otherwise.  Well, Drake was one. Creighton. Oh boy, Grinnell in Iowa. Those are  the main ones.  Did you ever compete against the University of Oklahoma?  They were not in the conference, but I   m glad you mentioned that  because (laughs) one of my braggadocios, which sounds a lot bigger  than it actually is, in all the time I ran on the A   M track team, there  was only one Sooner that ever beat me, and he went to the Olympics.  His name was Glen Dawson; the name will be familiar to quite a few  people. He went to the Olympics on the US team in the 3000 meter  steeplechase. I think he came in fourth, just out of the medals. But I like  to brag that there never was a Sooner that beat me at the two mile except  Glen Dawson, but he beat me so far that I didn   t even feel his dust.  (Laughter)  What about other student activities? You said you were in the crops  judging team and competed nationally in track. Were you involved in  any other student organizations or activities?  Yes, in the Aggie Society. I finally became vice president of the Aggie  Society.  What about academic achievements? Did you do pretty good in the  classroom?  Well, as a freshman I wasn   t too hot because this country kid wasn   t  accustomed to that kind of instruction. But I came in with a lot of As as  a junior and a senior. I did reasonably well.  What were some favorite student hangouts on campus and off campus at  that time?  Well, there were two, and I didn   t have money enough to go to either  one of them. (Laughter) Swim   s, over just across from Gardner Hall was  the main one. I   d go in every once in a while and get a malt. The other  was Aggie Corner up there across from where the fire station is now.  Right there on the corner of Knoblock and College  University  Avenue?  Yes, Knoblock.  13  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  What were the popular things to do, and what did students do on  campus?  Well, they had the thing called the Student Senate Dance, which actually  was held downtown. It was one that some of us poor boys could go to  because you only paid, I think, a dime to get in if you were a letterman.  Athletes, we got in free except for, I guess it was tax that we had to pay.  And then Swim   s corner was a very common meeting place for people.  Did they still have the tradition of the freshman beanies in those days?  Yes sir, and you better have yours on.  What happened if you didn   t?  There was a paddle about that long. (Shows length.)  (Laughter) Oh, mercy. What were the rules? Anytime you were on  campus, walking around campus, you had to be wearing your beanie?  Yes, sir. In your freshman year, you better have that beanie on.  Were there some other class traditions? It used to be that classes  competed against each other. Like, the freshman class would compete  against the junior class, or the ag college would compete against the  engineering college?  No, I don   t remember anything of that.  Was ROTC pretty big at that time?  Yes, we all were in it the first two years of college. We all took ROTC,  unless you had a medical discharge. I wasn   t too enthused over it, but  after all, it provided you some clothes to wear.  Were there dorm hours for the women? Did they have to be in at a  certain time?  Yes, but I don   t remember what they were. Of course, until I got to be a  junior, I didn   t have enough nickels and dimes to be interested in going  over to the girls    dormitories.  What sports were popular on campus?  Oh, football was the big deal.  14  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Who was the coach then? Do you remember the football coach?  The very famous Lynn Waldorf. Yes, he was a good coach, and he was a  nice guy. I remember one track meet that we went to when there weren   t  enough vehicles to carry the track team, Lynn Waldorf volunteered to  take us boys to the track meet somewhere up in Iowa, I think it was. He  was a nice guy. He was just as nice to us track boys as he was to the  football players, so we thought a lot of Lynn Waldorf. Puny James was  the freshman coach. Honestly, I don   t remember who was the basketball  coach. It wasn   t Hank Iba.  Coach Iba hadn   t gotten there yet?  No. Roy Kenny was the track coach.  What about wrestling? Did you become a wrestling fan while you were  at OSU?  I didn   t try to wrestle, but we had a good wrestling team.  Did you attend wrestling matches?  Yes, we got to get in free.  Students got in free?  Yes, if you were a letterman, you got in everything free.  Oh, okay. Now, they were wrestling in the old     In the old gym.  Which it was the armory for ROTC and now it   s the Architecture  Building. But the old gym. I understand that was pretty packed, a lot of  students in there?  Yes, sir. It was well packed. It wasn   t very large.  Russell, I guess within the first year you got there, we had the stock  market crash, then the Depression. How did that affect students  financially?  Well, I can tell that from personal experience. While I was still in high  school, there was a man came down. He was kind of what you   d call     shirttail kinfolks,    three or four generations removed. He was at  Mangum, and he said,    Russell, if you   ll come to A   M, I   ll give you a  15  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  job in my caf  .    So, that   s the way I ate, the first year and a half I was at  A   M. I had the sorriest job in the caf  . I cleaned up at night and  washed the pots and pans and scrubbed the floor, but gee whiz, I was  sure glad to get that job because that kept me fed. Those hard times hit  and his business went down. I lived on pretty slim rations in the last  semester I was a sophomore. To be exact, I kept a box of dry cereal in  the window in my dormitory, and a bowl and a spoon and a little packet  of sugar, and that was my breakfast. I   d put a little water on that      A little water?  I   d put a little water on that cereal to moisten it, sprinkle a little sugar on  it, and that   s what I had for breakfast. You could get an apple for a  nickel, so that was my lunch. And I could get a sandwich over in the  cafeteria for fifteen cents, and that was my supper, so you know about  how much strength I had for running on that kind of a ration. (Laughs)  So, the next semester, I just couldn   t get back in school, and I called the  head of the Field Crops and Soils department, Dr. Winters, asked him if  he could supply me with a job enough that I could batch and have some  meals.    Well,    he said,    why don   t you come up here and we   ll talk  about it.     So, I hitchhiked up to Stillwater (this was November) and met with Dr.  Winters. He said,    Yes, Russell, we   ll give you a job working in the  laboratory here for twenty dollars a month.    Oh, man, that sounded like  a million dollars to me  So, I came back up and enrolled. There was four  of us boys working in that department. Two or three weeks after school  started, Dr. Winters called us in and said,    Fellows, I   m sorry. Our funds  are getting low. All we   re going to be able to let you make is fifteen  dollars a month.    So, we did. That lasted maybe two months. He called  us in again and said,    Well, finances are tough. Twelve dollars and fifty  cents a month is all we   re going to be able to pay you.    So, we just kept  working like we always had. We got by on it.  Was this your third year in school?  That would   ve been my, yes, third year.  Do you remember where the caf   was located where you worked?  Yes. It was located right next to Hanner Hall. At the top   I believe it  was part caf  , cafeteria, and part   I think the armory had a piece of it  for storage.  Russell, as you look back at your time at Oklahoma State University,  what are some of your favorite memories of your time on campus? Do  16  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  you have some favorite special events or things that stand out in your  mind?  Yes, I think the most valuable memory that I have was coming in from  the field. I worked in the summertime out on the experiment station.  Coming in at noon and having lunch. There was a place that kept girls  during the school semester. So, second week of September, us boys  came in there to eat lunch, and there was a whole parlor full of girls.  And there was one   I get a little emotional when I get to this point.  There was one little blue-eyed blonde that, boy, she caught my eye. I  was very careful that when the house mother called us to lunch that she  was going to sit by me. So, I pulled her chair out and seated her, then I  sat down by her. Later on, (laughter) she told me that   s the first time a  boy had ever seated her anywhere, so I guess I made a little bit of an  impression.  Being a gentleman pays off, Russell. That   s great.  And then three years later, we began sixty-seven years of married life.  Russell, as we talked earlier, before we started the interview, you  actually got your first job before you graduated. Is that right? Could you  talk about your first job you had after school?  First job I had after   well, one day I had hitchhiked home for Christmas  and then hitchhiked back to work a few days in the laboratory, and Mr.  Staten, the crops judging coach, came in where I was working and said,     Russell, would you like to go out as an assistant county agent?    I said,     When?    He said,    Now.    I said,    Mr. Staten, I don   t have a degree.    He  said,    I don   t think it   s going to make any difference.    He said,    They   re  needing boys out there to help these county agents because they   ve got  this new government farm program that President Roosevelt has  installed, and the county agents are covered up. They need some help.        Well,    I said,    I   d be willing to take a look at it, I guess, if they don   t  care about the degree, but I don   t have one.       Well,    he said,    let me  talk to the district agent.    So, he did, and sure enough that afternoon the  district agent called me and asked me to meet him, so I did. We agreed.  He sent me down to Hollis as assistant county agent. One hundred and  thirty-five dollars a month   boy, that was big money, even if I did have  to furnish my own transportation, my own car. So, I went down there  and worked with Uncle Tom Marks, the oldest county agent in  Oklahoma. I was there for two years, and then the district agent I had I  asked him,    Mr. Diehl, when are you going to have a county for me?     He said,    The right one for you hasn   t come along.    So, when they  called me and said,    Russell, that county that you ought to have is  17  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  available now. Meet me over at Pauls Valley on such-and-such a date.  We   re going to meet with the county commissioners.    So, I did. They  had another guy already picked out for the job, but they gave it to me.  This is Garvin County.  Garvin County. One of the good ones   yes, you   d agree with that, being  a Garvin County native  But, honestly, it was one of the good counties  of Oklahoma.  Russell, can you talk about the rest of your career in agricultural  extension? How long were you in Pauls Valley?  I was county extension agent there for eleven years, and during seven of  those years we won the state championship in crops judging. We had  some grand champions in the livestock exhibition. I had a good bunch of  4-H club kids, and a good bunch of mothers and fathers, because these  mothers and fathers are influential in seeing that a kid does his work.  And we had some good kids.  Did you have any kids from Lindsey that were any good?  Yes sir, one of my top boys was from down south of Lindsey. Ray  Duncan. I also had Beverly Parr. Tennys Parr. Didn   t have Beverly.  Beverly was his dad. I had Tennys Parr as a 4-H club kid.  Where did your career take you after that? You were, what, about eleven  years, then, in ag extension?  The head of the department of the Field Crops and Soils department  called me and said,    Would you be interested in taking over the  Oklahoma Crop Improvement Association work?    Well, I had  developed several certified seed growers, particularly of corn, so I went  up there and we talked about it, and I took the job. I was head of the  Oklahoma Crop Improvement Association for seven years.  Was this still part of the extension service?  Yes, it was. Actually, I was a joint employee between the experiment  station and the extension service, because the two together were the  authority of seed certification in Oklahoma, which was my job. I walked  a lot of fields.  Which crops did you mostly work with?  Well, of course, at that time, the big crop was wheat, but we also had  18  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  quite an alfalfa seed program. And grain sorghums, of course, and one  that I doubt is still in existence: watermelons. Georgia had always had  the watermelon seed business, but we started growing certified Black  Diamond watermelons in Oklahoma, and at one time we had better than  two thousand acres of them that we had to inspect. I enjoyed it. Of  course, walking those sand hills wasn   t too easy, but it was still all right.  You were responsible for the entire state of Oklahoma?  The state of Oklahoma, that   s as far as we went. We had plenty. It was  mostly in the western half of the state, but we did have quite a lot of  wheat growers in the panhandle where we encountered a few  rattlesnakes.  You had to be careful where you picked your cotton, huh? (Laughter)  Your career took a turn after you finished that program, right?  Well     You went to     I got well acquainted with the seed industry as head of the Crop  Improvement Association. In fact, I got pretty well acquainted with it all  over the country because I was at one point president of the International  Crop Improvement Association. I wanted to get out into the commercial  seed business, which I finally did as manager of a wholesale outfit that  owned a fertilizer plant as well as a wholesale seed company, and I  managed the seed part of it. The fertilizer industry got us into trouble,  and that didn   t go too good but I continued to make money in the seed  part of it. Finally, I became director of the marketing division of the state  board of agriculture, which wasn   t as challenging as I   d have liked for it  to have been.  One day, a couple of guys from Oklahoma A   M called me and said,     Russell, would you like to take over the farm broadcasting for WKY  Radio and Television?    They said,    They   ve asked us to find them a  man, and there   s only two of them that we   re considering, and you   re the  top man.       Well,    I said,    I don   t know.    They said,    It   ll pay pretty  good.    So, I said,    Well, okay, I   ll take a look at it.    I went up and  talked to the manager of WKY Radio and Television and to his two  assistants. I said,    Well, it   s interesting. I   m not going to give you an  answer right now, but I would like to have an answer from you.     Of course, I had already started my own seed production. I said,    I   m in  the seed business, and I want to continue because it   s doing pretty good.  Do you have any objection to my continuing to grow certified seed?     19  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill     No, no.    They said,    The more of that you do, the better job you   re  going to do of broadcasting because you   ll know what the problems  are.    So, I said,    Okay, next question. Do you mind if I go down and  talk to Ed Gaylord?    Gaylord owned a publishing company and WKY  Radio and Television.    No,    they said,    we don   t care. Go ahead.    I had  heard a rumor that they were going to close out the farm department, and  I wanted assurance that I wasn   t going to get in there and then attend a  funeral. So, I went down and talked to Ed Gaylord. He said,    Russell, if  you want that job, I   ll give you this assurance: As long as the Oklahoma  Publishing Company owns WKY Radio and TV, there will be a farm  department there, and if you do a good job, it   ll be yours.    So, I went  back and told the manager,    I   m going to take it.    So, I did.  What year was this, Russell?  Nineteen fifty-nine.  At that time, was it radio and TV or just radio?  Both of them. I got up at two-thirty every morning, went out and got  things ready for radio, put it on   I did part of it live, and the rest of it on  tape. Then, run over to the other building where television was and did  the seven o   clock broadcast on television.  Let me back up and ask you a couple of questions. When you continued  to farm your seed business, did you own a farm where you were raising  your seeds?  Yes, well, it was contract. But, yes, I owned some land, but I needed  irrigated land, so I made contracts with farmers that had irrigated, and I  supplied the parent stock, which I developed myself.  Where were your farms located?  Most of the contract farms, the people I contracted with, were in Jackson  and Greer Counties, and some over in Harmon County.  Near where you grew up.  Yes, near where I grew up.  Let me ask you a quick question, and I mean this in a positive sense.  What had you done that you felt prepared you for this kind of job? This  was sort of a change, wasn   t it, from what you normally did? Did you  have some media experience?  20  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  I had been a guest on radio and TV repeatedly.  Okay. So, you weren   t intimidated by being in front of the camera and  being on TV.  I wasn   t camera shy, no, because I had been on so much. When I went  there, the program director said,    Now, I want you to close each one of  these programs that you do on television with a safety thought. We   ve  been doing that for quite a long while.    I said,    Okay.    So, I did. It was  just a verbal thing, and I thought,    Gee whiz, how boring can things  be?    (Laughter) So, I asked the program director,    Would you mind if I  put this stuff in rhyme?       Why,    they said,    no, not if you think you can  keep it up. Wouldn   t want you to start it if you can   t continue it.    I said,     I think I can handle it.    So, from then on, for twenty years, every  broadcast day had a new rhyme, maybe a little two-line or four-line  rhyme that had a meaning of some kind to it. And I honestly   some of  them were humorous; some of them were religious, spiritual. They  usually applied to some program of some item of the day. Occasionally,  it was politics. Now, you   d be surprised how much you can get by with  in goosing, jabbing a politician if you   ll put it in rhyme. I wasn   t vicious  with it, but made it a little bit amusing. So, I did that. Never used the  same poem twice.  Over how many years?  A little better than twenty.  And you come up with a new rhyme every day?  Every day. Every day. Monday through Friday, sometimes on Saturday.  Can you give me an example of some of your favorite rhymes that you  remember?  (Laughs) I don   t memorize them. I usually carry one or two in my  pocket, but that   ll use too much of your film, me trying to get it out of  my pocket.  Have you still got it in your pocket?  Got it in my hip pocket, this hip pocket     Go right ahead and pull it out. While you   re looking, I   ll be talking. So,  for all those years, five, six days a week, you came up with a new rhyme,  never the same rhyme. How did you do that?  21  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Well, the newspaper helps, you know, what the topics of the day are,  what things are of interest.  Kind of like Will Rogers used to do.  Well, don   t class me with Will Rogers. (Laughter) He was something  extra. Here   s one I carry in my pocket all the time. The thing that people  remember most about my broadcasts were these little rhymes.  It was your signature feature.  Yes, because it was always right at the end of the broadcast.  (Reading)  Have you hitched your wagon to a star?  You   d better know the star you pick.  Sometimes these worldly stars  repay with a most unpleasant kick.  But there   s one star of brilliant light,  a truly precious gem  you   re safe to hitch your wagon to:  the star of Bethlehem.  I carry that one with me all the time.  Great. Russell, let me come back and ask you, for someone that might  not have heard one of your broadcasts, can you describe what your  typical format was like and what you talked about in your programs  when you gave your report?  Well, we always started out with the markets, because that took up quite  a bit of the time. I made a deal with the major auction markets around  the state as well as the Oklahoma City market to provide me with a  broadcast (we called it a phoned-in report) of how their market went that  day. Each day I had the Oklahoma City market and one of the auction  markets out in the state like Ringling, Enid, Pawhuska, Chickasha  (Chickasha was a good one), Tonkawa, Altus. Those were some of them.  Just kind of covered the state. So, you   d give the commodity reports,  what the prices were, what goods were selling?  Yes, yes, we   d tell them what the prices were, how big the runs were at  the market, how many head they had. It was mostly cattle. Oklahoma  City reported the hog market, too, but mostly out in the state market was  just strictly cattle. They   d tell us how many they had in the auction and  what the prices ranged from different classifications of cattle. We had a  22  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  good audience.  And then, of course, there was on Associated Press, on the United Press,  the wire, there was always some agricultural news of national  importance, and we reported that. And other events of agricultural  importance around Oklahoma, we   d report them. It was interesting. As  far as I was concerned, there never was a boring day.  How long was your program?  Thirty minutes.  And was it around noon time?  We just did markets at noon, that   s all. Wouldn   t take but two or three  minutes to do market prices at noon, but our morning program on TV  was thirty minutes, and on radio we had it broken into six different  segments which were anywhere from one to two minutes.  So, in your TV program in the morning, what time did it air?  On TV? Seven o   clock. And I went on radio at five-thirty.  Wow, so you said earlier you got up     Five-thirty to six o   clock, maybe six-thirty sometimes, that was live, and  then the rest of it was on tape, but I had to be over at that TV show and  get that makeup on my face and all that stuff before the program started  at seven o   clock.  What time did you have to get up each morning?  Two-thirty. It wasn   t bad. You got used to it.  What time did you go to bed?  Anywhere from sundown to sometimes midnight, because I had an  occasional speaking engagement at a banquet somewhere that I had up  here.  You were pretty popular on the speaking circuit, as I recall.  No, not much. That was not one of my big deals.  You talked about Ed Gaylord earlier. Did you develop over the years a  relationship with Mr. Gaylord?  23  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Yes, Ed and I were on a first-name basis. We had neither by accident or  by intent   he had a lot of investment, and I had a meager investment in  the same company, and that   s where we first got acquainted. He put a lot  of money in with some other people, and I put a little money in. That   s  where our acquaintance started.  What do you remember most about Mr. Gaylord?  I remember that you could depend on what he said, and he didn   t mind  speaking his piece. Now, Mr. Gaylord, E.K. Gaylord, his dad was the  same way. I had great respect for Ed   s dad who lived to be 102. Maybe  it was 101.  Were there some other professional activities you were engaged in at  this time, during all those years, other things in the business you were  doing?  Well, this wasn   t really business. While I was on radio and TV, (and I  started this the year I was the president of the National Association of  Radio and Television Broadcasters) we decided we needed a little  money there in the national association. So, one of the guys    wife was in  a travel agency. We started taking tours, either foreign tours or cruises,  and the broadcasters would get people together from states around the  US. I don   t know how many of them I did, but I did it for several years  there on radio and TV to the point that I have been on every continent on  this planet except Antarctica. I never went down there and didn   t want to  go there, but I   ve been to all the other continents.  Switching gears just a little bit, could you talk a little bit about your  family? You had a couple of daughters, you and Bernice. Could you talk  a little bit about your family life?  Well, as I think I mentioned earlier in the show, there was a blue-eyed  blonde at that place where I had lunch when I was working out on the  experiment station in the summertime that we ran for Aggie Princess,  Aggie Queen, and we won, and the romance took off after that. We had  three years of romance and then got married, as I mentioned before. The  Lord was good to us and gave us a daughter after a couple of years, and  then six years later, along came another little blonde. The first girl was a  brunette. She took after me, although my hair   s not brunette anymore.  The other one was blonde. Both of them became school teachers.  LaNese majored in physical education up at Oklahoma State, and she  became a physical education teacher. Served, I don   t know, fifteen,  sixteen years at Harrah, Oklahoma, and when she retired, they named  the gymnasium after her. It is now the LaNese Craft Gymnasium. The  other one started out as an elementary teacher, after having graduated up  24  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  at Oklahoma State University, as did her husband, Bob Sholar. She  finally became a superintendent here in Oklahoma, and then one outfit  out in Colorado wanted her in the San Luis Valley. She went out there  for two or three years and then came back home and was superintendent  out at Binger, and then she finally retired. This is the blonde, the second  daughter.  That   s your second daughter that retired after being superintendent of  several schools?  That   s Patricia Gayle Sholar. She started out as an elementary teacher  and then finally became a superintendent here in Oklahoma, down in  southeastern Oklahoma. Then the school out in San Luis Valley of  Colorado made a good deal for her and she went out there for two or  three years, but she wanted to come back home. So, she came back and  was superintendent down at Hinton. No, the town south of Hinton     Binger. She finally retired, thought she was retired, but the state  superintendent of schools called her and said,    I need you.    So, she  became assistant state superintendent of schools and stayed with that  two or three years, but she didn   t like the politics of it. So, she retired  again, and Oklahoma City schools just kept after her until she went to an  elementary school down in southeastern Oklahoma and started teaching.  She   s now principal of it, but she says,    This is the last year. I   m going  to retire again.    (Laughs)  One of your daughters recently won a contest. Can you tell me about  that?  Yes, that   s my oldest daughter, LaNese Craft. And I talked her into it. I  got a piece of mail addressed to my deceased wife about the Senior Ms.  Oklahoma Pageant. It was just an ordinary publicity piece, so I told both  of the girls, I said,    You all ought to enter that. You might not win, but it  would be good experience for you.    Pat said,    No, I   m too busy.     LaNese finally decided that she would go ahead and participate in the  Senior Ms. Oklahoma Pageant, which she did, and which she won. So,  she   ll be representing Oklahoma in the Ms. Senior America Pageant in  Atlantic City, New Jersey, the first week of October. And her daddy is  going to go along as the supervisor.  Chaperone? (Laughter)  Chaperone, yes. As will some other people. We   ll have six or eight  people there from Oklahoma.  Kind of full circle there, since you had teenage daughters, and now  you   re coming back, chaperoning them again. (Laughter) When you look  25  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  back on your career in broadcasting, are there some highlights that you  remember, certain events, certain things that stand out in your mind?  Well, I don   t know how you   d put it, but being elected professional head  of the national association, I guess you   d call that one of the highlights.  And that was the National Association of Broadcasters?  And I got acquainted with a lot of fine people around Oklahoma. That  ought to be the highlight because Oklahoma   s made up of excellent  people, who many of them have come up the hard way, so they know  what it means to have difficulties and successes. Some of the other  highlights would have to be these tours and cruises that I took people on.  At one time, on one of the cruises, we had 256 people from Oklahoma.  Wow.  It was promoted on both WKY Radio and Television, and Wayne Liles,  who was the farm broadcaster over at Channel 9, also broadcasting, got  people to go on the tour. But we usually would have 150 or so on a tour.  You had a special honor from the National Radio and Television Farm  Broadcasters. You were inducted into their hall of fame, is that right?  Yes.  Was that pretty special to you?  I think they ran out of anybody to elect, but I did appreciate it.  You served as president of the National Association of Radio and  Television Farm Broadcasters.  Yes, I served all the way up. You start out as a second vice president,  then vice president, then president.  Those must   ve been two pretty significant events in your life for you.  Yes, that   s right. It was important, yes.  Russell, can you share a little bit. Since you retired from broadcasting,  you didn   t retire from life. You   ve been very active and busy. Can you  share some of your activities since you left WKY?  Well, after I left broadcasting, of course, I spent a lot of time here at the  fairgrounds, first with my own business, then as supervisor of the feed  26  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  and bedding services.  A lot of people wouldn   t understand for the state fairgrounds what it  means to be in charge of the feed and bedding services. What do you do?  The state fair and similar events, which would have to include the  world   s largest junior livestock show, which is the Oklahoma Junior  Livestock Show, which is now called the Oklahoma Youth Expo, those  are very influential in developing young people that may go into  agriculture, or they may go into industry or into a profession. But they  get some of the basics of life when they compete in an event like the  state fair or the junior livestock show. And frankly, I readily admit that  the achievement of the people that I have coached in those events, the  young people, have been accountable for some of the progress that I  have personally made in life, if I have made progress. Frankly, their  winnings brought attention to me because I was the coach.  You also, when you are providing the bedding and feed service, you are  taking care of all of the animals in these events. You are taking care of  all the feed for them and the straw and the hay, is that right?  Well, the feed and bedding service that I supervise, and in which Steve  Corbin does most of the actual work, I do most of the buying because  I   ve had a lot of buying experience in past events that I   ve handled. I do  most of the buying of the livestock feed and bag feed and hay, and the  bedding, which part of it is straw, but most of it is wood shavings. And  the best deals on wood shavings come out of Canada, so I do a lot of  dealing in Canada. One of our main suppliers of bedding is here in  Oklahoma, the Xylo Corporation, headquartered in Wayne, Oklahoma.  The bag feed we buy is mostly what used to be the Superior Mills. It   s  now owned by another corporation. They are the supplier, the old  Superior Mills, and Purina Mills. Those are the two main bagged feeds  that we handle.  And this is big business.  This is big business. We buy in semi -truck  loads. Some of the things  like wheat straw, we generally get that in in bobtail loads of 200-260  bales on a bobtail truck, but the shavings all come in on 53-foot semi  loads.  Russell, you provide contract services for the fair, and you   re still in  charge of this today.  I operate as a consultant. I am not a state fair employee, I guess for good  reason. By the time the state fair took over the vendorship themselves,  27  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  my age was such that it probably, insurance would   ve been prohibitive,  so I   m a consultant. I bill the fair every month for my services.  This has been since 1983, is that correct?  Yes.  And you   re still doing it, which is amazing. You come to the office and  work every day.  Yes. If there   s anything going on, why, I need to be there. Even though  Steve Corbin is going to do most of the work, I still need to be there.  Russell, two questions. If I can, I want to back up for a minute. I meant  to ask you when we were talking about WKY and your broadcasting,  what was important to you when you were broadcasting? I mean, what  did you think about the most? You were talking to these tens of  thousands of people out there. What standard did you hold yourself to as  a broadcaster?  Well, first of all, you   ve got to be truthful, and secondly, you   ve got to  speak in terms that they understand. Some of these technical terms  would be a little bit out of range for some people, not because of their  intelligence, because they   ve got more of that probably than I have,  more intelligence, but just they haven   t been exposed to certain terms.  So, you have to keep your conversation on the air in terms that people  can readily understand. And sometimes they   re not listening too closely,  so you want it to be such that if they only catch part of it, why, it   ll be of  help to them.  What was most important to you when you were broadcasting, when you  were saying what you were saying? What did you keep foremost in your  mind?  I want to make a good Christian impression on people without going  overboard on it, and I want to speak distinctly so they can understand  what I say and speak slowly enough that each word is understandable.  The information you were broadcasting, how important was that to these  people   s lives?  Well, it was very important, because from an economic standpoint we  tried to keep them up to date on what things were and what laws were  that affected them and that sort of thing. We tried to keep everything  clean, rather than trying to be funny.  28  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  People were making important decisions, based on some of the  information that you were giving them, weren   t they?  Well, yes, of course they did, especially on the markets and on what  prospects were for legislation. Those were quite important to them. We  tried to keep them as informed as we could with our ability.  You talked to them about possible pending legislation at the federal and  state level, trends nationally and things like that?  All the way, and sometimes what foreign developments were.  International markets and how that affected prices, et cetera?  Yes, if it looked like some country was going to cut us off on imports,  why, a farmer needed to know that.  This had to be a responsibility you took pretty seriously, then.  Well, you bet. You better take it serious because you   re affecting lives.  Not in a smug way, but did you feel good about being able to give that  kind of information to help people improve their lives and to make good  decisions? Was that important to you?  Well, let me put it this way: If you   ve done your best, you don   t go to  bed with a guilty conscience. Does that answer your question? (Laughs)  Yes, sir. Good answer. Thanks, Russell. Let me fast forward back to the  fair. I just want to ask your feelings about the state fair. How has the  state fair changed over the years since, gosh, all your life you   ve  probably been associated with it, but particularly in your contract  relationship? How has it changed?  I can answer that in one word: Tremendously  My first participation in  the State Fair was out when the fair was back over in the east part of  Oklahoma City. I was county extension agent, and we always brought a  truckload of hogs up here to show, and we always brought a hammer  and nails along with us because we had to rebuild those pens to keep the  hogs in. But when the State Fair, or the City of Oklahoma City, and I   m  not sure who the instigator was, when they got their eye on this nursery  down here (which was southeast of the business part of Oklahoma City)  and was able to start building some buildings, that   s when the fair began  to really make progress, and then of course when we got to attracting  horse shows, and became known as the world   s leading horse show  capital, and it was true as well as was the world   s largest junior livestock  29  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  show, which was held in the spring here. And then when this motel/hotel  tax went on, and was assigned for the benefit of the fair operation, that  really set us off in good shape. So, the fair has made progress and is still  making progress. That building in which my office is, it may be here a  year from now, it may be here two years from now, but eventually it   s  going to be another brand new building when the tax money comes in.  Russell, let me ask you this question. In your opinion, are state fairs as  important to people today as they used to be in the past?  Well, the answer to that is yes and no. One place at the state fair that is  not as important to people as it used to be, especially when we were  back on the east side of town there, we had big farm machinery shows.  We don   t have that anymore, not big ones like that, but the farm show is  held at other times in the year. There   s a big farm show held here on the  fairgrounds. This is the place for it. It   s really important to farmers to  come see what new machinery there is, and insecticides, and everything  else that   s involved in farming.  Russell, changing a little back to OSU, you   re pretty special to  Oklahoma State University. You   re inducted in the Alumni Hall of Fame.  You   ve remained closely connected to OSU throughout your career and  throughout your life. Can you talk about some of your experiences with  the university and with the Alumni Association through the years?  Well, I   ve attended many of the county extension meetings, and I  haven   t been to one in the last three or four years that they have at OSU,  but I   ve always kept up contact with the Fields Crops department,  Agronomy department, with the publicity department, and have been on  a first-name basis with most of the deans of agriculture that we   ve had  up until the last couple of years. I have not been   well, you know, I   ve  been riding what I like to call my    aluminum horse,    and that restricts  my activity in some events because I am totally unable to walk without  the help of that instrument.  I alluded to it earlier, but you   ve received numerous awards from  Oklahoma State University: recognition, induction into the Alumni Hall  of Fame, you were a Distinguished Agriculture Alumnus in 1998.  That was a big thrill.  Have these been pretty special to you?  You bet. Those things are very special to me. I try not to brag about it,  but I do anytime I   m in a meeting where I   m expected to speak. I carry  along one of those little summaries of the highlights of my activities and  30  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  let the master of ceremonies use whatever he wishes to use in  introducing me.  It always has those two awards on it, doesn   t it?  Oh, you bet.  This is a general kind of question, but you   re going to be ninety-nine this  December. Is that correct?  That   s correct. If the Lord   s willing.  What do you attribute your long successful life to? Most people have  already, if they   re still on this earth, retired and are barely getting  around.  Well, as an old farm kid, I got a good start in life, with plenty of exercise  with a hoe and a cotton sack, and driving a team to all kinds of farm  implements, because horse power and mule power was the main power  when I was a kid. There were a few tractors around, but not many.  Furthermore, I think my high school experience was very valuable  because as a member of the male quartet, I was quite frequently called  on to appear before crowds, and of course, being an athlete, I was out in  front of them. But at A   M, I was very active in the Aggie Society, and  another society that is not of too good a repute, known as the Ruf-Nex.  They were a pep organization. They had two pep organizations at  Oklahoma A   M, Oklahoma State University: the Ruf-Nex and the  Hell Hounds. Well, I didn   t like that name of Hell Hound, because that  didn   t go along with Baptist very well, so I joined the Ruf-Nex, and as a  pledge, they beat the tar out of you, but we took it. We couldn   t shave  for, I don   t know, six or eight weeks. That was part of the initiation, but  I was in organizations of that type on the campus.  How important has your Christian faith been to you?  Major. Probably more than anything else in life, because there   s only  one ruler: that   s the son of God, Jesus Christ. He   s got to be the ruler of  your life, or you have wasted your life. So, I   ve tried to live by the Ten  Commandments. As all other individuals have experienced, I have not  been totally successful because we   re all sinners, and by the grace of  God we can enjoy eternal life if we put our trust in Jesus.  You   ve been a deacon for many years at your church, is that right?  I became a deacon in 1941. I was a young deacon. I guess I was low  thirties? Something like that, down at Pauls Valley. And, incidentally  31  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  though, I never had a lesson in music at any time. I cannot read a note of  music. For a couple of years, I led the singing in the First Baptist Church  at Pauls Valley. (Laughter)  You were telling me you were in the quartet. What were you? Tenor?  Bass?  Oh, I was bass. I was the low bass. My voice was even lower then than it  is now.  What were some of your favorite songs?  I did some solos. Basic songs where you went way down. One of my  favorite songs was    Asleep in the Deep.    It was an ocean song.  In your opinion, Russell, how has OSU changed over the years? You  saw it in 1929; we   re now in 2010. How in your mind, fundamentally,  has it changed?  Well, what   s the difference between a pygmy horse and a draft horse?  (Laughter) That   s about the difference. Oklahoma A   M was small  compared to what it is now. I remember it must   ve been my junior year,  could   ve been senior, our enrollment hit just a touch over 3,000. Boy   We thought we had blown the lid off. Now what is it? (Laughs)  Twenty-one, twenty-two thousand?  Yes. But in facilities, Oklahoma State University is so very, very much  bigger than Oklahoma A   M was when I started school there, and  we   ve got more facilities out in the state than we had. We have spread  the dispensing of knowledge to a lot more places.  Russell, has that been important to you as a farm broadcaster, and being  in agriculture all your life? The experiment station, the county extension  offices, the outreach of a land-grant university. Is that important to the  state?  Why, absolutely. You bet your life it is. It   s very important, and it was  important to us in broadcasting, too, because a lot of our good stories  originated there. We had one program that we carried for several years  that, had it not been for the extension service, the program would not  have been. That   s what we called the Farmer/Rancher of the Month.  Every month, we went out and did a story on the farm with a farmer and  his wife, and usually had the presentation of the award at a civic club  meeting there at the hometown of the folks. But the extension service  and the Farm Bureau and the Farmers Union, which it was called at that  32  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  time, they were the source of most of the programs that we did on the  Farmer/Rancher of the Month. So, extension service was very important  to us in broadcasting.  Did you ever go to Stillwater and work with them there on campus in  some of their ag broadcasting?  Occasionally, but not too often. Mostly they came out in the country.  Well, when we did the Farmer/Rancher of the Month, nearly always  someone from the radio/TV section of OSU that was with us.  You   ve alluded maybe to some of this, but what do you think have been  OSU   s strengths as a university through the years?  Strengths? Well, it   s too much to enumerate. As far as farmers are  concerned, they have carried knowledge out there and put it in such  terms that the farmer could handle it, and they   ve done that very often  times with the cooperation of industry, chemical companies, fertilizer  companies, engineering companies. Extension service, their fingers have  reached very far.  Have you been on campus recently? Have you seen any of the new  buildings?  I couldn   t tell you when the last time was that I was up there. The last  time I distinctly remember being there was when Burns Hargis invited  me and a guest to be his guest at a football game up there in his suite.  I   ve been there at other times, too.  What kind of a job do you think Burns is doing?  I think he   s right down to earth. You bet. I think he   s a good man and  he   s got industry experience, financial industry, particularly, that can be  very beneficial to OSU.  Russell, over the years, like you   ve said, you   ve known most of the deans  of the College of Agriculture, probably a lot of the presidents. Who are  some of the university administrators, presidents, deans, others that  have stood out in your mind that you think have been important and  made contributions to Oklahoma State University and to the state? Are  there some names that jump out to you?  Well, I   m going to put it this way: with the exception of a very, very  few, they   ve all been very important to OSU. We   ve had good deans of  agriculture. We   ve had good deans of engineering, though I have not  been acquainted with the engineering deans very well. Dean McElroy I  33  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  think has been a wonderful influence on OSU.  And Dean McElroy helped get the College of Veterinary Medicine  started, didn   t he?  Yes, you bet. That   s been a great asset to Oklahoma. That Vet Medicine  College has been, though I have not been well acquainted with the  individuals who   ve headed it.  Did you know Dr. Willham very well?  Oh, yes. Oliver Willham, you bet. (Laughs) He always called my wife  his little Perry girl because that was her home. Yes. Oliver Willham. In  addition to being a good dean, he was a doggone good man, and I liked  Bob Kamm, too. Bob   s wife and I got real well acquainted, I guess  because of banquets that were held in Oklahoma City. I know one time  she was up there at the head table with the rest of the dignitaries. I was  sitting in the first row, just below the head tables, and I could tell she  was getting bored to death, so I slipped up to her and said,    Go ahead  and yawn. It   ll be all right.    (Laughter)  Was this Maxine?  Maxine. (Laughter)  Were those Oklahoma County student recruitment banquets that the  Alumni Association put on? Murl Rogers and so on? Is that the banquet  you   re talking about?  This was a banquet held down at the Skirvin Hotel, and I don   t  remember what the occasion was. Of course, I went to so doggone many  of those things.  Well Russell, what are you going to do for your one hundredth birthday?  Are you going to do something special?  First of all, I   m going to praise the Lord for being so considerate.  Do you have any plans for the next century?  Yes, I   m going to try to live part of it. Actually, many years ago, when  Mr. Gaylord died, I set my goal that I was going to live to be 102 years  old. Actually, at the rate I   m going, I think I might achieve it, plus some.  And he was 102 when he died, right?  34  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  Gill  Pierson  It was either 101 or 102. I think it was 102.  Do you have any hobbies or other interests that you do other than here  at the state fair?  Yes, I love to work. Honestly, honestly, I do. I love to work. I used to  have a hobby of running, but when I got to where I couldn   t stand up  without holding on to something, I quit running.  Good idea. Let me leave you with this question. It   s a serious question.  How do you hope people will remember Russell Pierson?  As a good guy that tried to be considerate of other people, as a man that  lived by the Golden Rule, and that he knew what eternity meant, either  in one place or the other. So, he wanted to be with Christ in eternity.  It   s a better alternative, isn   t it? Russell, what have we left out? Is there  anything we didn   t cover that you   d like to share? We covered a lot of  different things.  I think you have pretty well drained me.  I hope we didn   t wear you out. (Laughter) You were talking about your  greatest blessing in life. Can you share that?  Well, I honestly, Jerry, other than accepting Jesus as my savior and the  promise of eternal life, I think the greatest blessing was when God called  Bernice and me together that September noonday when I came in from  the field of the experiment station, dirty, sweaty, and perhaps smelly,  and found that whole parlor full of girls at that boarding house, and that  little blue-eyed blonde attracted my attention. Honestly, I think God had  a hand in that because that started three years of romance and sixty-seven  years of very happy married life until God called her home in  2002, and the assurance that we   ll be together again at some point before  too many years. For that, I   m grateful.  Well, I appreciate it, Russell. Thank you very much. You   ve blessed the  people of the state of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University with  your life and the things you   ve done, and we   re very appreciative of that.  Thank you.  -------  -------
