Speaker 1: My full name is Oliver, O-L-I-V-E-R, White, W-H-I-T-E, Hill, H-I-L-L.  My birth name was Oliver White, and my mother divorced my father in the early--about 1911 and married Joseph C. Hill [ph.].  They were both living in Hot Springs, Virginia, both living and working in Hot Springs, Virginia, up in Bath County, Virginia at the Homestead Hotel, where they met.

Speaker 2: Okay, and, sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 1: I'm retired now, but I'm still do a lot of community service and pro bono work, but I went to law school in 1930 and passed the bar in December of '30 [1930]--I mean '33 [1933] and became member of the Virginia Bar in September of 1934.  And from 1934 until I think in '99 [1999], I finally retired.  And the only reason I retired because I couldn't half hear and I couldn't see.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Give me one moment.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, he's ready to roll again.  Sir, what is today's date?

Story_ID: 191990
Speaker 1: Sir, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask, and they just require a short answer.  The first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Man, I like to eat, yeah.  I--when I was a kid I used, thought it was salmon salad.  I remember one time saying that salmon salad was, would be my favorite.  I could eat it every day.  But that's--of course, I outgrew that.  But I, I like mostly--I could come nearer to determine what I didn't like than something favorite.  I, I like most foods if properly cooked.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I think green is my favorite color, green or brown.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter) warm weather.
Speaker 1: Whenever that occurs.
Speaker 2: Whenever, yeah, daggone right, whenever it is, wherever you are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see, I'm--my theory is that when you're cold or when you're too warm, you're just uncomfortable.  When you're cold, you're downright miserable.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Designation?
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation spot, vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite what?
Speaker 1: Phrase or saying.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have one.  I take it from [Paul Laurence] Dunbar, "When day is done, face the dawn and not--greet the dawn rather, and not the setting sun" [sic, "When all is done, say not my day is o'er, and that thro' night I seek a dimmer shore: Say rather that my morn has just begun,--I greet the dawn and not a setting sun, when all is done"].
Story_ID: 191991
Speaker 1: I'd like to ask you about your family history.  And I'm gonna ask about your mother's side and your father's side.  And I'm gonna start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My full, mother's name is Olivia Louis, L-O-U-I-S.  And we never talked too much.  I think, I don't think she was too happy as a child.  We never talked too much about her childhood or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Do you know her birth date?
Speaker 2: Do I know her birth date?
Speaker 1: Yes, her birth date.
Speaker 2: I don't know the birth day, but she, I can tell you this.  She was nineteen in 1906 when she got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And where was she born, do you know?
Speaker 2: She was born here in Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, well, so she didn't talk much about her family.  And what do you know about that side of the family?  How far back can you take 'em?
Speaker 2: I can go back as far as my great-grandmother, maternally.  I had, 'cause I was reared--see, my father deserted us before I was a year old.  And my mother--I don't know when my mother left, but she left some time at an early age to go up to Homestead [Hotel] and work to support herself and, and me.  And I was reared from that time until I was six, six years old by my great-grandmother and a, and an aunt.  And all I know is I had a--I don't--I know I never was abused.  I know I was, I was loved and because one instance of it is, is they took a picture of me when I was four years and was real dressed up in my Buster Brown, Buster Brown suit.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that consists of--what did that consists of, that Buster Brown suit?
Speaker 2: It consisted of pants and coat, like any other suit.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did your--what was your great-grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy (laughter), I knew you gonna ask me that, and I'm intending to try to think of it before.  I can't think of any of it or part of it right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, but did she ever talk about life in the 19th century and growing up?  Did she talk about what her life was like?
Speaker 2: No, no, see, she never talked too much.  And I don't remember asking a whole lot of questions.
Speaker 1: Okay, had she been a slave?  Do you know that?
Speaker 2: Oh, Mama?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I told you, she was, she was nineteen in 1906.
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about your great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: Oh, my great-grandmother.  Oh, I don't, I don't whether--yeah, she used to--she tried to tell me.  I came back over here one time in, when I was nine years old.  I left here when I was six.  And I came back when I was nine and spent a week with her.  And incidentally my paternal--my father heard I was in town.  And he came by and, and visited me.  And, but--I'll tell you about that in a minute, but, but she tried to tell me at that time--the only thing I remember, she tried to give me a whole lot of names and things that I didn't, they didn't mean anything to me.  And the, and the only thing I remember was that she--our line--now, whether we free or slaves, I don't, don't remember, but our line was here before the Revolutionary War.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I have--a friend of mine, I mean one of my distant cousins and I decided recently to, to do a little research.  And we know that my, one of my uncles was--both of, both of my--one of my uncles and my father--my grandfather were born before, before the Civil War, and therefore, during slavery time.  Now, whether, whether they were slaves or not, I don't know yet.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, sir, what was--?
Speaker 2: And, but, my paternal grandfather, I mean maternal grandfather was a Semitic.  I don't know whether he, he was--whether he was a Jew or, or--what do you call it?
Speaker 1: An Arab?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: An Arab?
Speaker 2: No, I--and maybe--I don't know think, I don't think he was an Arab but, you know, if he been an Arab, he never would have got in medical college in Virginia.  But I think he could have been, he could have been a Lebanese or something like that, you know.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: I don't know what he was.
Speaker 1: So Lebanese Christian or a Jew?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You think either a Lebanese Christian or a Jew?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, no, you see, Lebanese are Muslims too, aren't they?
Speaker 1: Well, there're Muslims and Christians in Lebanon.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Could, of course, he could be an Egyptian, I don't know.
Story_ID: 191992
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll put it this way.  (Unclear) I don't want to disrupt your order of questioning, but I can tell you about my mother [Olivia Louis Hill] when I was in law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], made appointment (unclear) down here, met my father and, and went to, went to New York and to, he became as I say, he was a medical doctor practicing in New York.  And she went up there and met him, came back--if you want to know about that now, I'll tell you now or wait till you get to it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, yeah, let's talk about your mother.  She--so her--yeah, tell us about your mother and what she was like and what she did?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was--I loved her.  She was, she was a very small woman.  As a matter of fact, she only came up to my shoulder.  She was--everybody thought she was white.  I mean so far as--she was one of those people that you see today, they're Negroes by choice.  And so, if she was by herself, she was always treated as she was white.  Of course, if I was with her, they knew she wasn't.  But, and see, she was very--obviously, she was fond of me, but what happened was, when I was six years old my grandfather, paternal, paternal grandfather died, and within a few months around that same time, my maternal [sic, paternal] grandmother came to Richmond [Virginia].  And after a few days, she died.  So evidently she just came to Richmond to die.  She was living in Scranton, Virginia--I mean not Virginia, Scranton, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, when my mother and my stepfather [Joseph C. Hill] came to the funeral and that's the first time I ever saw my mother to know her.  And that--of course, I immediately took to her, and my stepfather took to me.  And so when they left, they carried me with 'em this time to Roanoke [Virginia].  And coming back to my--
Speaker 1: So you were about six years old then?
Speaker 2: I was six.
Speaker 1: Six when you went back, went to Roanoke with your mother and stepfather?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And they couldn't put me in school till the next year, at seven.  I don't know whether it was because the school year had already started.  I know they wouldn't let me go or whether the Negro children at that time in Roanoke couldn't start school till they was seven.  But anyway, that's when I started school in Roanoke.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we lived in, in a house that faces, faces Henry Street and thirty-nine--39 Gilmer Avenue [Roanoke, Virginia].  And that's, this was when?  What, 1913.
Story_ID: 191993
Speaker 1: Okay, now, can you tell me what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: What was what?
Speaker 1: Some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds I heard.  But see, that next word you had--?
Speaker 1: Oh, smells?
Speaker 2: Smells?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: I don't know about the smells, (unclear) no promise.  But Roanoke [Virginia] back in those days was a fast town and it was regarded as little, Little New York socially.  And most people were newcomers there.  See, Roanoke had a brief history.  It started off as a spot called Big Lick.  That's where the animals used to come down and lick the salt off of the rocks.  But anyway, I had--we, we lived in a home at 39 Gilmer Avenue [Roanoke, Virginia] with a family, another family named Mr. and Mrs. Pentecost, Lelia Pentecost and Bradford Pentecost.  And Mr. Pentecost had been recruited by the Norfolk and Western Railroad [Roanoke, Virginia] to upgrade its dining car service.  So he was a chef cook on the dining car, and that was one of the best jobs then Negroes had in Roanoke at that time.  And, he also, they'd also recruited a waiter named Woodruff [ph.], but I never had a chance--I didn't know about him at that time.  And he, he--and his daughter was in my class in the elementary school [Gainsboro Elementary School, Roanoke, Virginia], but I, I never associated her with, with anything.  But anyway, in 1915 [sic, 1916], Virginia went dry.  See, Virginia went dry before the long before the company--I mean country did.  And my father, my stepfather [Joseph C. Hill] was operating a pool parlor down on Norfolk Avenue [Roanoke, Virginia], across from the railroad station.  And it was down in the saloon district, nice spot for, for a pool parlor.  And when Virginia went dry, he felt it was gonna kill the spot, kill the area, so he--and he couldn't find another suitable spot for his business on Henry Street [Roanoke, Virginia]--that was the, that was the business street in that area of town.  And so he went back to, decided to go on back up to Hot Springs [Virginia] and hop bells like he'd been doing before.  And my mother at first was gonna stay in Roanoke to let me go to school because the only thing they had up in Bath County [Virginia]--that's where Homestead [Hotel] is located, was a little one-room school, and that wasn't suitable for my education.  So--but at the same time, the Pentecost's had purchased a place in what we called in those days, a changing neighborhood.  And they were at 401 Gilmer Avenue [Roanoke, Virginia].  And they used to go up there from time to time to look at the renovations being made on the house.  And I always went along with 'em.  Well, I was so comfortable with the Pentecost's that my mother decided to just let me live with the Pentecost's and she went on back up to Homestead to be with her husband.  And so that's why, so from the time I was eight years old until sixteen, I was living with the Pentecost's, and the families consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Pentecost and, and her half-brother, Wilber Petitt, who has a son who's a dentist in Chicago [Illinois] now. You may have--might know him since you're from Chicago [Illinois].  I don't know whether you do or not.
Speaker 1: No, I don't, I don't know him.
Speaker 2: But anyway, and, and had a full brother named Roy, Roy Hamilton [ph.].  And, and then, of course, every now and then some other railroad person would, would stop and live with us for, for a year or six months or something because he was going to school.  And he'd drop out of school and work on the railroad for a year or so, and then go back.  And, but, and but the Pentecosts I'd say were outstanding people.  You know, back in those days there were so many--most, most things were handled by door-to-door salesmen, and they had a custom, of course, they'd go--come to one house in the Negro neighborhood and try to sell something, and then they'd get the name of the person who lived in the next door.  And, of course, they--they were white males, and he'd come to the door, and "Is Lelia here?"  "Well, nah, there's no Lelia is here for you".  If you wanna see Mrs. Pentecost, that's different.  But anyway, if they insisted on Lelia, we'd slam the door in their face.  And so word got around, if he wanted to do any business at the Pentecost house, you ask for, for Mrs. Pentecost.  And then if when you came in, you took your hat off.  And, and show her--treat her with all the respect you'd treat a white woman.  So as a consequence, I developed high esteem for the, so far as the individual is concerned.
Story_ID: 191994
Speaker 1: You're saying the Pentecosts set a good example.
Speaker 2: Oh, they did set a good example, set a wonderful example.  And, see, of course, back in those days, you know, we had, had stoves in the, in the, in the rooms.  And I had my chores.  I had to bring in, bring in coal, wood for the, to heat the stoves, put it--carry it around and put it in rooms, and all.  On Saturdays I had to dust off the furniture and stuff.  And I thought it was a great invention, we had a Victrola, and I thought it was a great invention when they had--you'd put a record on there, and it would, at the end of it, you'd throw it back and start it and play it over again, you'd didn't have to run and change the, change the record (laughter) every time it ended.  But they used to have a lot of social events at our house.  And, and kids were, they were also, you know, back in those days, had more restrictions than they did anything else.  And they didn't allow--a lot of people didn't allow their children to go to movies, didn't allow 'em to dance, didn't allow 'em to do this, that and the other.  Well, the Pentecosts were fine people, and they had high standards, moral standards, but they didn't have all that foolishness.  So the kids were--my house was a hang out place for kids, for a lot of kids in the neighborhood.  I remember one time they had a little, a little rec room over on Wells--Third Avenue.  It was Wells Avenue [Roanoke, Virginia], but they called it Third Avenue, just like they call Gilmer Avenue [Roanoke, Virginia], Fourth Avenue, and I heard that they was gon' put a, put in a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] soon.  So I came home and I called, you know, the way kids do, know all and, and telling Mrs. [Lelia] Pentecost that they gon' bring a YMCA to Roanoke [Virginia].  She said, "Well, you don't worry about no YMCA.  YMCA is for, places for people who don't have no home.  You got a home."  And so I--and then, of course, by the time I was thirteen, we had remodeled the house again and made it into a two, two-family situation; changed the front, upstairs stairs and turn it around so you could come in the side door to go upstairs, and, and from outside, if you wanted to.  And then we had--of course, the place had hardwood floors and had French doors, and we had a big space there.  So we used to have lot of--I mean the, the grown folks had a lot of parties there.  And as I say, it was, it was a social town.  And Mrs. Pentecost, and then they had the whist club, the women had a whist club.  And they--I used to love to play 'cause, you see, I was the only child in the house for about, well, all the time for, except for about, a period of about six months one time.  It was a little girl about my age.  But somehow I can't think of her name nor her, why she came.  But she lived with us for about six months.  But during four or five years of the time I was with the Pentecosts, there was a girl named Elizabeth Goins [ph.].  Elizabeth came up from the country somewhere and lived with the Pentecosts and went to school.  And then by the time she got about seventeen or so, she, she wanted to go out and she left the Pentecosts' and got pregnant, and then I remember going to the hospital to see her.  And she wanted to come back, but Mrs. Pentecost wouldn't take her back.
Story_ID: 191995
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Sir, where did you go to school when you lived with the Pentecosts?
Speaker 2: Well, I started off at what was known as Gainsboro Elementary School [Roanoke, Virginia].  And it was over on Gainsboro Road [Roanoke, Virginia].  My first teacher was Olivia Downing [ph.].  The Downings were a very prominent family in, in Roanoke [Virginia].  The father [Reverend Lylburn Downing] was a Presbyterian preacher and preached in the [Fifth Avenue] Presbyterian Church [Roanoke, Virginia].  And she had two--three brothers.  One was a physician, the oldest one, and the next one was a dentist and the youngest one was a, was a dentist and a marvelous surgeon so far as face-restoration of, of people, people's faces and things when they come from accidents.
Speaker 1: Plastic surgeon.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: A plastic surgeon, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he, he was--mainly, he was a dentist.  And of course, and the Downings were nationally-ranked tennis players, that is, Elwood [ph.] and, and Lynwood [ph.].  And they were the first and second boys.  And our, our social set was very tennis comp--conscious.  I started playing tennis when I was nine years old.  And back in those days, I used to go out to the tennis court and stay practically all, except to go home and get a sandwich or something.  And I was--matter of fact, I was supposed to go to the nationals, when I went to, went to Washington [D.C.] to go to [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you like school when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Hum?
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I liked school.
Speaker 1: Did you do well in school?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter), yeah, I did all right.  But the funny part, I fell in love with Miss Olivia.  She married a, a doctor Dr. Rose [ph.] out in, out in Akron, Ohio.  But I, in first grade or primer--I don't know which, what it, what they called it.  I don't know.  I think they called it primer, primer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and I'd wait around.  She, she had to wait about an hour after school was out.  And I'd sit around and wait for her to walk home with her, and she walked past my, past my house.  Well, she walked up Fifth Avenue [Roanoke, Virginia], and there was, and it was Lick Run Field next door, so I, I'd walk that far with her, and then run down the field and to home.  I--but I was really in love with, with Olivia Downing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of course, I got--I, I fell in--I was in the love business (laughter), I'll tell you about that later.  Oh, well, yeah, I can tell you now while we're going.  They, the kids played in the, in the street next door to our house.  And, and they started, tried to start me off by playing piano by now 'cause I couldn't carry a tune from her to there, but, and the kids at the time, kids would be playing out there and they wanted to practice during that time.  But anyway, there was a lady named Miss Mauldin [ph.] who came to visit Washington, Roanoke--I don't know if she visited.  She came here to live for a while.  And she had a daughter named--I don't know what her first name was because she was in, a college girl at, at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  And she used to come up to our house to practice on the piano.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was eleven by this time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she, she used to come up there and practice, and whenever she came to practice, I, I'd stayed home there and listen to her.  I mean, you know, it was in the summertime.  And, and when she would finish practicing her music, then she had a piece and she knew, had a picture of a preacher who's trying to lay his bible on the table and reaching for a woman.  And the name of the song was, 'A Long Tall Brown Skinned Gal Can Make a Preacher Lay His Bible Down'--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and then she used to tell me, that's my, that's our song.  And then she'd play that thing and make, make funny, google eyes at me and, and tell everybody that she was gonna wait for me (laughter).  So, man, I, I was beaming (laughter), but unfortunately, she, she got killed in an automobile accident a couple of years after that.  I never, I'd say, but to me, she was Miss, Miss Mauldin, and so I don't remember, remember her first name.  I'm sure I heard it, but I've forgotten it.
Story_ID: 191996
Speaker 1: Did you read the local newspapers when you were coming up?  The [Richmond] Planet and the [New] Journal and Guide (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, see, the reason I know that we were, were kind of poor when I was, up 'til I was six was because I don't ever remember seeing a newspaper or a book or a magazine or anything like that.  And, but when I got grown, Mr. [Bradford] Pentecost had a habit of going through the, going through the train and bringing, picking up loose papers.  So I, I got, I was familiar with, with names of newspapers from St. Louis Post-Dispatch [St. Louis, Missouri] and the Cincinnati Enquirer [Cincinnati, Ohio] and Washington Post [Washington, D.C.] and, of course, the Birmingham--I forget the Birmingham papers, and The Atlanta Constitution [later, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Georgia], and I knew the--New York Times [New York, New York] was, was owned by people named [Adolph] Ochs who also operated the Chattanooga Times [later, Chattanooga Times Free Press, Chattanooga, Tennessee] and, oh, man, he, he used to be, he liked to read the editorial page, and I started off with the, with the funny papers and Mutt and Jeff [comic strip] and [The] Katzenjammer Kids [comic strip] and, oh, I don't know, Little Annie, Little Orphan Annie [comic strip].  And I think little orph--I think Little Orphan Annie may have come out after, a little later.  But anyway--I said, Mutt and Jeff, didn't I?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, you enjoyed the comics.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I enjoyed the comics anyway, and then too of course, he used to read some of the things to me.  I started reading that way.  That's the way I started reading.
Story_ID: 191997
Speaker 1: Now, did your--did he [Bradford Pentecost] talk about politics at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: And about the situation of--
Speaker 2: I don't ever remember anybody talking about politics until I got to, got to Washington [D.C].
Speaker 1: Did they talk about race relations in Roanoke [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well, talked, talked about race relations, and I'll tell you about that in a few minutes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Roanoke and Chattanooga [Tennessee].  But as I say, I was very sheltered from, from white folks, so that--initially.  And, of course, in nineteen--one, one, another thing, both Mr. and Mrs. Pentecost and I'm sure they had the same influence on my parents, they didn't believe in, in buying things on credit.  And if you bought something, you saved your money and you bought it.  An example of that was I remember when I was ten, I decided I wanted a bicycle.  And, and so I decided the way I'd get it would be to develop a little Sunday morning newspaper route.  And, and I used to sell the Hearst American--[William Randolph] Hearst, New York, New York American [New York, New York] and the, and, of course, The Roanoke Times [Roanoke, Virginia].  And on Sunday morning, I'd get up at three o'clock in the morning and go down and get my papers, as they'd come off the press--this is, this was my idea too, get the, get the papers as they come off the press so I could get out there early and, and sell my papers in, in the white neighborhoods before the kids got to running around.  And, and back in those days, you know, you didn't have radios or anything.  Anything happened out of the ordinary, you, you'd pay--the newspapers would put an "extra".  And you running around talking about "Extra, read all about it, extra," and certain things, whatever, it was a wreck or whatever it was that happened.  That was a big thing in those days too.  And a big calamity town like Roanoke, and, from time to time, we'd have train wrecks.  And so, and come--sometimes you'd get it, it'd be you're so damn cold, you come on out, you have to come home and thaw out a little bit and then go back out (laughter).  But anyway, I bought one, my bicycle.  And then I used my bicycle to, to ride around in the Negro neighborhood.  I did stuff when I was in the white neighborhood on foot because, for foot I could move, moved, had more, more flexibility.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in case you had to get out of harm's way?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  It was, if you ran into a bunch of white boys, you know, they, they gon' chase you.  But anyway, I remember one instance, one time and, I saw a bunch of white boys, and I--they were chasing me.  And one of, one little ole, little ole white boy was in front.  And I looked around and the others had stopped, and we were almost a block away from 'em.  When I saw this happen to him, I, I suddenly turned, (laughter) and he turned, and I turned.  He turned too and looked, and he saw he was away from--boy, he turned around and--of course, I picked up a rock and threw it at him and helped him along (laughter).  That's the only, only time I ever had any problems really, but, (unclear) because there was no, no, no contacts between white children and Negro children except that in--there were certain spots in, on the fringes where we, we would go, and we'd have rock battles.  They'd throw rocks at us, and we'd throw rocks at them.  And every now and then some white kids come down through the neighborhood, and I remember one time one old white boy came riding through there on a bicycle.  And I grabbed him, and I must have been about eleven by that time, myself, and I grabbed him and pulled him off his bicycle and cuffed him up a little bit, riding through our neighborhood.  And the, and the same thing about, when you get a little older, it was the same thing about girls.  You'd go down Northeast, guys would chase you away.  And you didn't think too much--guys from Northeast come to Northwest, where we live going to see the girls.  Now, one interesting thing.  When I was about, in about the third or fourth grade, two things happened.  I was in a rather large class.  We had about thirty kids in the daggone class, and, and the teacher got married.  Of course, back in those days, if a teacher got married during the term, she immediately lost her job.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Had to be single teachers.  And they got--they brought in a substitute.  And we gave her a fit.  And then that, that started off, a whole lot of devilment and the consequence see.  And it also happened, whatever, the third or fourth grade, whatever it was that, that they taught Virginia history, I remember going home and asking Mrs. [Lelia] Pentecost, "Mrs. Pentecost, if the Confederates won all the [Civil] War battles, how did they lose the Civil War?"  She said, "Don't you believe everything you see in that history book, particularly if it's mentioning, dealing with, with Negroes."

Speaker 1: When you were coming up, did black adults talk about the Civil War at all and the role of black soldiers in the war?
Speaker 2: No, no, very, very little talk about, so far as at our house.  I don't know what happened at the other houses, but at our house--as, as a matter of fact, I never had nobody, except for that time I was nine I was telling you about, to sit down and talk about the Civil--Revolutionary War, slavery.
Speaker 1: So it just wasn't discussed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were trying to get around it.  For example, in Roanoke [Virginia], they, there was, it was a producer--not in Roanoke, but there was a producer, Negro producer, he started off in the Midwest, named Oscar Micheaux, I'm sure you've heard of him.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Oscar Micheaux was able to sell enough stock in a production in Roanoke to produce a picture of middle-class Negroes.  And they, they put the--took the, took the pictures between the three hundred block, and a house in three hundred block belonged to a waiter and his wife, and the Pentecosts in the four hundred block and the street between.  And right now, I can't--I did, did remember the name of one of the leading male characters, but I can't recall who it right now.  But, but anyway, the house--the name of the picture was 'A House Behind the Cedars' [sic, 'The House Behind the Cedars'].  And he had a big party in our front yard, we had a large, we had a large, large front yard and large backyard.  And in the backyard we had three grape arbors, one, one blue--I mean one grape, white grapes, and two blue grapes, and we used to make plenty wine and grape jelly.  And we had a cherry, big cherry tree and a little peach tree.  And it was, it was--and we had a little, a little, they put in a little--one of which, I don't, I can't think of the word now, they used for small goldfish.
Speaker 1: A pond.
Speaker 2: Pond.
Speaker 1: Yeah, goldfish pond.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and we had a car garage at the end of the, end of the lot.  And then part of the time, pet--raised Belgium hares, those great big brer rabbits.  And another time, at the same, he also wired off a big part of the yard there and had Belgium pigeons.  And boy, that meat, you catch that squab and at the end of a month, that is the sweetest meat that you ever, the sweetest meat you ever tasted.
Speaker 1: Oh, a squab, yeah.
Speaker 2: So were the Belgium hares.  They was better than chicken.  But anyway, now, where was I?
Speaker 1: Well, we were talking about--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I came off of the--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I started telling you about Oscar Micheaux.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They had this party, and I, I was walking through there.  You remember, you remember when, when Philip Morris [cigarettes] started off, and he had the, had the little bellboy [Johnny Rovetini] calling off, walking, walking around in hotels, [calling out] "Philip Morris." Anyway,--.
Speaker 1: Right, ran a television ad.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a radio and TV ad.
Speaker 2: It was a television ad.
Speaker 1: Yes, okay.
Speaker 2: And, anyway, I went, and I wasn't saying anything, but I was walking around through the, through the crowd--I know Mr. [Bradford] Pentecost put him up to it, and walking around through the crowd, looking, like I was looking for somebody.  (Laughter) That was cameo shot, so that got me, later years that got me an invitation to speak at the film festival up at University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia].
Speaker 1: And what movie was that, that you were in?
Speaker 2: I was on film, on a program with [HistoryMaker] Tim Reid, his wife [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid].
Speaker 1: Okay, what movie was that?
Speaker 2: That was '[The] House Behind the Cedars'
Speaker 1: 'House Behind the Cedars,' okay.
Speaker 2: 'House Behind the Cedars.'
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 191999
Speaker 1: Sir, tell us about high school, now--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Tell us about your high school career?
Speaker 2: Oh, let me, let me just finish about elementary school [at Gainsboro Elementary School, Roanoke, Virginia], and then I'll (unclear)--it won't take but a second so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was in the fifth grade, the first semester, I just sit inside--see, in the meantime, when the War [World War One, WWI] started, my parents [Joseph C. Hill and Olivia Louis Hill] had left Hot Springs [Virginia], Homestead [Hotel] and gone to Washington [D.C] where, and he [Hill's step-father, Joseph C. Hill] worked in the [U.S.] Navy, in the [Washington] Navy Yard during, while the War was on.  And then I went to Washington to live with them.  (Laughter) They had no, neither one of them had any experience with, with children.  And, and I remember come--oh, I forgot to tell you.  See, I was the only child in the house most of the time, and I had, we used to always have a great, big Christmas tree.  And it was laden with things, everybody gave me a, gave me a whole lot of Christmas presents and stuff.  And I, I wouldn't look, take anything apart until everybody came downstairs.  I wanted 'em to see how fine it was, how, what great stuff Santa Claus had done for me (laughter).  And pretty soon, when I went to Washington and my parents--they had little, little tree sitting there on a, on a table, and, and they gave me a, a briefcase (laughter).  And--
Speaker 1: You were disappointed, I guess?
Speaker 2: I was so disappointed I, it was such a come down, I was so depressed they decided to send me back to Roanoke [Virginia].  (Laughter) But when I got back here, they had decided that our class was as a nuisance, that they sent 'em, sent it, moved it down to, to a school in, in Northeast [Roanoke, Virginia], under a very strong teacher named Sarah Brown [ph.].  And (laughter) I had, I had a, as I say, it was a boy in the class a little older than I, who was named Petie Wilson [ph.]--his name was Charles Wilson [ph.], but we called him Petie Wilson.  And Petie would think of something--we, we, we thought of some devilment all the time.  And, and the kids had a false sense of unity, and they--and nobody ever would squeal on who was doing, doing the devilment.  And so--and that was during the time when Rudolph Valentino--you've heard of him?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, he, he came out with a picture called 'The Sheik' and we walked around with sashes, put a little sash on our side during recess and things, chasing little girls (laughter) and sing the song, about the Sheik.  And, and as I say, then when we went to graduate from there, went up to, back--came back to Northwest [Roanoke, Virginia], and they had the school [Harrison School] on, on Harrison Street [Roanoke, Virginia] in the seventh and eighth, eighth--seventh and eighth grades.  A year before, before I got there, when you graduated, finished the seventh grade--before the class ahead of me got there, you finished the seventh grade, you went away, graduated and you had to go away to school.  You usually came down to Petersburg, Virginia, Virginia Normal Industrial Institute [later Virginia State University] or the [Fork] Union Academy [ph.], or down at St. Paul Academy [sic, St Paul's College, Lawrenceville, Virginia] or else you dropped out of school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it, that class finished the seventh grade, they put on a eighth, and when they finished the eighth, they put on the ninth.  And when they finished the ninth, they put on the tenth, so therefore for four or five years, they were graduating every year.  And we got, and I passed through the eighth grade, that's when I left and came--went to Washington.
Story_ID: 192000
Speaker 1: Tell you an incident that happened, to show you how crazy we were, in the eighth grade [at Harrison School, Roanoke, Virginia], we had another strong teacher named Miss Rayford [ph.].  And she left one day, and Petie [Wilson (ph.)] wrote something on the board.  I don't remember what the hell it was right now, but, but she came back, and she, and she wanted to know who, who wrote it.  And she started one line, just asked each individual, "Did you write it, did you write?"  So, of course, nobody admitted to writing it, including Petie.  And, so then she said, "Well, we're gonna stay here"--it was near closing time at the time this happened, she said, "We're gonna stay here until somebody decides to tell me who wrote it."  And finally about four, a little after four or something like that, she (laughter) announced that she was going home and, and get her dinner and for us to sit, keep in, stay in our seat and don't make no disturbance.  And we, we--she--her house was, we could look out the back window of church--of the school and see, see her back entrance to her house.  And so we kept a watch, you know, 'cause we had a picnic until we saw her coming back.  And we stayed there until six o'clock, but you know, no kids ever, nobody ever admitted to it until Petie finally broke down and admitted he did.  As so I say, they, we had that, had--but it was that unified so far as the class was concerned 'cause, as I say, it was, it was dumb but it was, it was--and, and most of, most of the kids in class got to work.  Every now and then one, one would fail, but we kept--if one, one or two failed, we'd pick up one or two from the other class.  So, but the bulk of 'em lasted.  And I told you one little girl in class, very quiet little girl named, oh, shucks, I can't think of her first name right now, but her last name was Woodruff [ph.].  And, and so in recent years, one time, they held it over in Roanoke [Virginia], and they were, they were giving me a send, a little send off, and they said that--Gracie said that I'm going over there to see one of my younger elementary school, school classmates.  And she said, "Huh, I'm older than he is.  I'm one year older than he is," (laughter).  And so she, she's still, and she, and she's still living.  So we, we're the hang outs.  I can also remember when I was eleven, when Armistice Day [November 11th] came along, walking all around town and then another thing had happened--
Speaker 2: This is the end of World War I [WWI], right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the end of World War I.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighteen [1918].
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighteen [1918], that's right--
Story_ID: 192001
Speaker 1: --Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And another situation happened at that time, a Negro, young, young Negro and, and his girlfriend one Sunday evening went to, to a drugstore there [Roanoke, Virginia] on the fringe and ordered Coca-Cola.  And the guy reached down and got a bottle of Coca-Cola and was gonna pour it in his glass.  And the boy said, "Wait a minute, no, I want, I want the, we want the fountain drink, with the seltzer."  And he said, "We ain't got nothing like that for, for Negroes."  And, anyway, they got to arguing, and the first thing, the boy reached over and got the Coca-Cola bottle that he had, and landed him up,  hit him upside the head with it.  And, of course, they, they knew him, and they arrested him, and then they was supposed to be, gonna, gonna lynch him.  And we had a character in Roanoke [Virginia] named Bert Wade [ph.].  He had been a Pinkerton agent.  As a matter of fact, the talk when I was a kid was that Bert Wade broke up the McCoy--oh, hell--
Speaker 1: Hatfield.
Speaker 2: Hatfield-McCoy feud in West Virginia and Kentucky.  He was the one that broke it up.  And he--another situation that happened one time, (unclear) apparently, he had, he had--we had a Hudson Super-Six [automobile], a green Hudson Super-Six, and he had a yellow one.  And he, he had a police dog.  And this policeman came up and for some reason or another, he leaned over, leaning over in the car, and the dog growled.  When the dog growled, he reached back and got his pistol and pulled it up.  And about that time, Bert came up, and grabbed his arm and twisted it and took the pistol away from him, unloaded it, threw the bullets one way and gave him his pistol back and booted him on his hip and told him, get the hell on back across, in the street where he belonged.  He thought, if he thought, he really intended to shoot his dog, he would shoot him.  (Laughter)  And so, this damn policeman went back and I think Bert must have been the stool pigeon for the, for the police department 'cause when they went back, the guys told  him, well he, you didn't have no business over there messing with Bert, with, with Bert.
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: Because Bert ran the, he ran the house of prostitution, and he was--he, he ran the bootlegging business.  See, bootlegging was big business back in those days, by that time.
Speaker 1: But Bert was black, right?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Bert was black, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, Bert was a black guy, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He had, we had a baseball team called Bert Wade--Wade's, I mean Wade's Giants [Roanoke, Virginia], Wade's Giants.
Speaker 1: Wade's Giants, okay.
Speaker 2: He stayed in Roanoke until World War II [WWII] came, and then he left and went to New, went to Newport News [Virginia].
Story_ID: 192002
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School] in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, Dunbar was, was one of the finest high schools in the country at that time.  We recognized it.  And it's reputation caused me to leave Roanoke [Virginia] and go up to--my stepfather [Joseph C. Hill] called me and asked me if I wanted to come, go to high school, high school, and he also asked me what I wanted to enter, if I did, did I want to enter under my own name or continue to carry his?  Well, I--he was the only father I'd ever known, and, you know, and so I told him, no, I was gon' continue his name.  And anyway, I went to Washington [D.C], and we had started to, well, we--just before that, when I was in seventh grade at Harrison--we called it Harrison High School [Harrison School, Roanoke, Virginia] 'cause see, it had the seventh and eighth grade.  And we started, they had a, had a coach named Fred Lawson [ph.].  And we used to get up at five o'clock in the morning and go down to the city auditorium and been an affair there the night before, we'd have to pull the seats together and stack 'em up against the wall in order to play, practice.  And that, that's the first really time that this segregation really struck me.
Speaker 1: How so?  How so?
Speaker 2: 'Cause I knew there were white kids would go to Jefferson High [Roanoke, Virginia], and the white kids had, had a gymnasium, and lockers and showers and everything.  And we had to go there and stack up chairs if we wanted to play, then come back--and, of course, and that, by that time, at our house, we had a shower, but most kids didn't have--all they could do was wash up a little bit if they--(unclear), just come on to school like they, like they were.  I don't know what they did, but anyway, that was (unclear) I think that was my first real concern about race, racial segregation, except one other thing.  We had, they were doing this, when this talk about lynching this Negro.  Bert Wade [ph.] hired, used all his folks, gave 'em a rifle and they walked to the, to the station, walked to railroad commissary, where Negro and the waiters and cooks and things.  And they congregated one time on the other side of Henry Street [Roanoke, Virginia] and shot a few shots in the air, but that was the end of it.  But, but see, the first--World War I [WWI] was trench warfare.  And we, we had, in our neighborhood, it was both, half white and half black, we had, a little white boy who delivered the newspaper.  And his mommy was able to--and crocheted beautiful work, did beautiful crochet work, Miss [Lelia] Pentecost, she didn't know face value of it was, and Miss Pentecost used to pay her for what she charged.  But, and so when this, this talk about lynching came up, I fantasized on it.  I had, my, my poor, my, my paper boy and his mother entrenched with us (laughter) 'cause they were our white folks, and poor white folks at that.  And one time we visited their house, because Miss Pentecost wanted to do something special, and hell, wasn't a chair in sight, and just some pallets on, on the floor.  You know, they were that, that poor.
Story_ID: 192003
Speaker 1: Now, [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.].  We're talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah Dunbar, Dunbar now go back to Dunbar.  So, I had, I asked when I was about twelve years old, if these kids--as I told you, kids used to play in the, in the side of the yard there.  And so I started playing base--football with, with the big boys and they had me playing center (laughter).  But and we, it was, it was always--most of the time it was a run game then, back in those days.  And, but anyway, I bought--that thing cost me, I bought me a uniform, and so I carried my uniform with me when I went to Washington [D.C.], and I went out for the football team.  But they, but they, they passed out uniforms in that time, so I started playing football.  And made that team, and I had a friend who came from Oberlin, Ohio, running, running a hundred and ten seconds.  And he would--.
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: Half back, aw, hell.  I have to let names come to me.  I have a terrible, terrible time with names.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll just--when it comes to you just let us know.
Speaker 2: Burton, Raymond Burton [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Raymond Burton.  And Burton and I, we, we used to go around on Sundays, we went around visiting churches, looking over the girls.  And, but, and during, during my years at Dunbar, we, we beat Dunbar [sic, Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.] three of the, three of the four years I was there.  And that made me a successful student--well, I would come with Dunbar, I mean with Armstrong [Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.]--that was the other high school for Negroes in, in Washington, Dunbar and Warren Armstrong, Armstrong Technical High School, it was supposed to be.  It was more, it was more manual training and that sort of stuff.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Anyway, let's see, where else?  Oh--
Speaker 1: Well, this is a good place to, well, sir--
Speaker 2: Well, Dunbar also, Dunbar also had a cadet corp.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you had to, you had to drill.  But I learned after one year that if you claim you were gon' be a physical ed [physical education] major, you wouldn't have to drill, so I did myself a disservice by announcing that I was gon' be a physical ed major, 'cause see, Dunbar mainly was, they (unclear), they put great emphasis on training kids to go to college, but I always figured I was going to college.  It never occurred to me I wouldn't.
Story_ID: 192004
Speaker 1: Tell us about law school [at Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and about Charles [Hamilton] Houston?
Speaker 2: Well, as I indicated, Dr. Mordecai [Wyatt] Johnson, the president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.], had determined to make Howard University Law School a first-class law school, capable of training Negro lawyers to carry cases to the [U.S.] Supreme Court in a record and in a sufficient character of briefs, to enable the Supreme Court to follow, reach a, a decision.  All right, up un--from, from the (unclear) up until 1930, Howard Law School had been an evening school with only adjunct professors, decided and determined that we, what we should do is abandon the evening school and make Howard Law School a full credit, full day, full, first-class law school, would be to have a full-time day law school, with full-time faculty.  And he engaged the services of, of his cousin, who had just recently finished, Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], William [H.] Hastie.  He engaged the services of Dr. Leon Ransom, who had finished [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and a member of the Order of the Coif [Honor Society].  And he had a young Jewish lawyer from Chicago [Illinois] named Cohen [ph.], and then there was a fellow who had been teaching at one of the Midwestern schools--I can't think of his name now.  He was, a sort of Jewish name--I mean German sort of name.  And, and then there was a (unclear) Taylor [ph.], a Negro lawyer in from Chicago.  And, then doctor--Mr. Daniels [sic, A. Mercer Daniel] was a full-time librarian, and they had gotten a fund and made, started off with an excellent library.  And then in 1929, I think it came to a head in '30 [1930], a young man, I gave you his name--what did I tell you his name was?  You see, my problem is--anyway, a young fellow whose father--I'll give it to you eventually--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --his father had died and left him a rather large estate.  And he said, hell, he didn't earn it.  He could--he turned the money over to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] to fight integration [sic, segregation].
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 192005
Speaker 1: And Charlie [Charles Hamilton Houston] suggested that we have one of his, one of his classmates at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to do a study and recommend how we would attack segregation.  In the meantime, this man recommended that we challenge education and that he suggested that--it's two versions of this, one that he did and one that he didn't, but he suggested that we ought to file suits simultaneously all over the South to, to seek the overturning of Plessy versus Ferguson [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896].  Charlie accepted the idea of challenging the (unclear) point of education, but he said, we would be batting our heads up against a stone wall to challenge segregation per se back in the early '30s [1930s], and that what we ought to do is to challenge the, the question--raise the question at its weakest point, and that was, the separate, but equal, I mean the equality.  Everything was separate, but nothing was equal.  And that's what we, we did.  Now, so what really happened in 1930 was the beginning of an organized attempt, organized attempt to overthrow Plessy versus Ferguson.  And we had several interesting people to be in, to take, enter, enter law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] in 1930, among them being Thurgood Marshall with--that year, had finished Lincoln [University, Chester County, Pennsylvania], who graduated from Lincoln University with honors.  I, I had not--I had completed my junior year in, at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and was coming into law school on a combination situation which left one year, after the first year of satisfactory work, I would get my Bachelor of Arts degree.  And, and it so happened that--and then the (unclear) and the two carriages, as I said, the carriages project was, was Charles Hamilton Houston.  All right, Thurgood [Marshall] and I became proteges of, of Sir Charlie.  He was, we used to, we used to work at the--classes would let out at 11:30.  We'd go down to one of Father Devine's [ph.] restaurants down on Seventh Street [Washington, D.C.], and you'd walk in and say, raise your hand and say, "Peace is truly wonderful," and you'd get a fine lunch for twenty-five cents.
Speaker 2: That's all you had to say (laughter)?
Speaker 1: That's all.  You'd a get a fine lunch for twenty-five cents, and deluxe lunch for thirty-five [cents].  But Thurgood had a much bigger appetite than I did.  He frequently got the thirty-five, but I was always satisfied with the twenty-five.  (Laughter), Anyway, we'd eat lunch, and then we'd come back, and we'd spend the rest of the afternoon studying and, and thinking in terms of doing research, thinking in terms of what we--how we're gon' challenge, how we gon' support our work in overturning Plessy [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896].  And within--seeing us there every day, as I said, we soon became--Charlie became interested in us, and we became his proteges.  All right--.
Speaker 2: Now, you all called him Iron Pants.
Speaker 1: Iron Pants, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, why?  Why'd you call him that?
Speaker 1: Well, he was (laughter), Charlie was a, he was a workaholic for one thing.  He was very stern (laughter) so, and that's, that's--it was an expression to indicate his sternness.  That's all.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But he was a hell of a wonderful fellow, but he was not a, he was not a glad hammer [sic. glad-hander], back patter, back patter, or nothing like that.
Story_ID: 192006
Speaker 1: But anyway, at around five o'clock Thurgood [Marshall] would catch, go to, go over to Union Station [Washington, D.C.], go back to Baltimore [Maryland] because he was commuting, and I would go to my job.  I had a job, evening job waiting tables at Stony Court Apartment House [ph.].  And, but as I say, we--they did retain evening classes [at Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.]--I mean the senior evening classes, but that was gon' be the last night class.  And the first year, freshman class for the preceding year was the second class, the second-year class.  So there was no senior class, daytime.  So that was the first year.  And in that first-year class, and one, one of the fellows who went there, was from Raleigh, North Carolina, not Raleigh, Durham [North Carolina].  And they had a man who wanted to go to pharmacy under the guidance of William [H.] Hastie, and he asked for Dr. [James E.] Shepard, who was head of the H--of the North Carolina school [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] there at Durham for his transcripts.  And Dr. Shepard wouldn't pass it up.  So then they had to file suit against Dr. Shepard and, and North Carolina College [sic, North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] to get his transcripts from 'em, and by the time that ended, the man had changed his mind.  So that case fizzled.  But in the meantime, the senior night, the last night senior class had a bunch of, of fine students, and they formed what was known under the guidance of William, William Hastie, they find--they, they formed, what was known as New [Negro] Alliance, and they picketed the Sanitary Grocery [Co., Washington, D.C.] stores--the Sanitary Grocery stores were the forerunners of Safeway [Inc., Washington, D.C.].  And they had 'em arrested for picketing, and they carried the case [New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., 1938] to the [U.S.] Supreme Court, Belford [V.] Lawson [Jr.] and I think, oddly, he was one of the members of the, of the class.  And, well, I don't know who argued, but anyway, Belford was one of the main things, (phone ringing), and I, as I say, names, I can't pull 'em all the time when I want to even though I know, I can see 'em in my head.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But anyway, you can get the cases of Sanitary Grocery--I mean New Alliance--New Negro Alliance versus Sanitary Groceries [sic, New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., 1938], and they established the right of Negroes to picket for employment.  And, and then they undertook a challenge against People's Drug Store.
Speaker 2: Now, what year was this, sir?
Speaker 1: This was in the early '30s [1930s, sic, 1938].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: As I say, this was the first organized attempt, and we in the meantime, we graduated in, in '33 [1933], and all, everybody took the exams that year and most of the members--well, well, we started out with a class of, of thirty-some, I think it was thirty-six.  Anyway, by the time we got to graduation, it was something like eleven or twelve.  Of course, back in those days, they looked at you, used to tell you, you know, look at the man on your left and look at the man on your right 'cause one of you not gon' be here next year.  But anyway, the attrition was, was horrible, but I think practically everybody who graduated passed the bar [exam], during the year.  Some of 'em passed the--took the [Washington] D.C. bar immediately.  And Thurgood took the, the Maryland bar immediately.  I had planned to take the Virginia bar, but it wasn't--next one available was in December.  So I couldn't take the bar until December.  So I had, had a little pressure on me.  Everybody's passing the bar, and (unclear) what if I don't pass?
Story_ID: 192007
Speaker 1: Now, you had a scare, right, when you tried to take the [Virginia] bar exam?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You had a little bit of a scare when you tried to take the bar exam, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but anyway, but anyway, well, in determining to go to law school [at Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], I found I needed another quarter of foreign language, and so I decided to take--somebody told me it would be helpful if I took Latin.  So I decided to take Latin.  And in that Latin class was a young freshman named, that's Samuel W. Tucker, and, and we were in Dr. [George M.] Lightfoot's Latin class.  When I finished law school, Sam finished college [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  But Sam had been a precocious young man, and his father [Samuel A. Tucker] had operated a real estate business and insurance business in, in--had joint offices with, with one of the lawyers over in Alexandria [Virginia] named Watkins [sic, Thomas M. Watson].  And Watkins had taken an interest in Sam, so from the time he was twelve years old until he finished college, he worked in the offices there.  And as a matter of fact, he (unclear)--they taught him how to type and take notes and, and he was reading law and stuff.  So he felt that he was, he was in--had some sufficient experience to take the bar [exam].  So I ran into him one day, and he said, you know, "What you doing?" and found out he was studying for the bar.  So I told him I had [Dudley W.] Woodbridge, Woodbridge's notes, that was the guru from, from, over there at [Marshall- Wythe School of Law of the College of] William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia], where all the Virginians studied for bar.  And so every Thursday after lunch, I would leave and go down to the restaurant at Twelfth [Street, Washington, D.C.], and eat and go to (unclear), go to Alexandria and let Tucker read my notes, and I'd read their--they had an old, out-of-date--it was a 1924 code.  Of course, things didn't change as much as they did in the later school was 1930, but they didn't--the law didn't change much then as it did, fast as it do now.  So but anyway, to make a long story short, sure, make a (laughter)--we both took the bar in December, and then we passed.  I, I remained in, in Washington until the next fall.  And got married in September and went to Roanoke [Virginia] later on on my honeymoon, and then started practicing in Roanoke in September 1934.
Story_ID: 192008
Speaker 1: But at that time, that was the middle of the [Great] Depression, and most of--more people were walking the streets than were working for the Norfolk and Western [Railway].  That was principal employer in Roanoke [Virginia].  And so after a year and a half--I was a little, little on the dumb on the side.  I didn't, didn't raise some of the issues like challenging, and allowing Negroes to serve on juries and things.  If we had the information, but I was waiting to get a paying client.  I had a little experience, by--court appointed me to represent some indigent people, but anyway after a year and a half, I decided to come on back to Washington [D.C.] and I got active in, in a lot of things and then waited tables and--to get some money 'cause that's what I'd been doing all the years we were there.  But anyway, in 1939, one of the members of the--well, anyway, in 1939, I agreed to come to Richmond [Virginia] and practice with a lawyer who had been in the class ahead of me, J. Byron Hopkins, and he, and a lawyer named [J. Thomas] Tom Hewin [Jr.] whose, who was at that time, was practicing with his father.  And that's when I came down here on May 1, 1939, they had fallen out.  We had agreed on, on everything.  They were supposed to get a firm in--quarters for us, but they had fallen out, and so, and so I opened, eventually, opened up a office by myself, solo practitioner.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I would, but I would work with Byron on some things, and Tom on, on some things.  For example, Tom and I--Tom had gotten some people down in Porter [ph.], had employed, had employed him to get them, get them the right to vote in the Democratic primary.  Well, and the--in a case known as Wise versus [sic, Bliley v. West, 1930]--?
Speaker 2: So West versus Bailey [sic, Bailey V. West, 1969]?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Was that West versus Bailey?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: That's not it?
Speaker 1: No, here, it ran--knocked off it off my mind completely now.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  You say it was Wise versus somebody else.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, two Negro lawyers and Cohen--and, and a Jewish lawyer named [Alfred E.] Cohen brought a case against the democratic party, Wise versus Bradley [sic, Bliley v. West, 1930], and he was a relative of a recent congressman [Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.] as a matter of fact and big funeral directors in Rich--in Richmond.  Anyway, he was secretary of the Democratic Party.  And the court ruled that to deny Negroes to vote in the Democratic primary was unconstitutional.  And so, anyway when we--so we challenged the--we brought, we--as I was saying, in August 1939, we prepared the petition and everything, and went down to Emporia [Virginia] and filed, in the court, we filed the suit.  And the court took the position that you wouldn't assume that the electors were not going to do their duty, but that if they didn't, he would be in Emporia on Tuesdays--the Democratic primary was on Tuesday's in those days, he'd be in, in Emporia on Tuesday, and he would, he would issue an order.  But when word got around, they permitted Negroes to vote in the Democratic primary.  But (unclear) Thurgood [Marshall] and Charlie [Charles Hamilton Houston] had filed a suit [Murray v. Pearson, 1936] against, on behalf of a boy in Maryland named [Donald Gaines] Murray [Sr.], and they had got his right to practice law--I mean to attend law school in University of Maryland [School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland].
Story_ID: 192009
Speaker 1: Well a big issue, also a big issue at that time [1930s] was the denial, I mean the, the practice of paying Negro teachers less money than they paid white teachers similarly situated.  As a matter of fact, the highest figure of nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars for Negro teachers, highest Negro teachers were paid in Virginia, and a thousand dollars was the lowest salary paid white teachers, the salaries might range from a thousand to seventeen or eighteen hundred dollars.  And Negroes ran from three fifty to--beginning salary from three [hundred and] fifty [dollars] to three [hundred and] ninety-nine [dollars].  All right, so Thurgood [Marshall] had filed a suit [Murray V. Pearson, 1936] in Maryland, but the district court had ruled with 'em so we still had no legal, legal precedent by, by the [Maryland] Court of Appeals.  So, when I filed suit against the City of Norfolk [Virginia] in the early--well, they had filed a suit, Tom [J. Thomas Hewin, Jr.] and, and the, and [J. Byron] Hopkins had filed a suit on behalf of a woman named Aline [Black]--on behalf of a teacher who had been in the system for eleven years, but they, they laid hold, letting 'em have a hearing until after the--at the end of the school term.  And when the court ruled against them saying that she had waived her rights when she signed the contract, and then they failed to rehire her.  And see, teachers were hired on a one-year contract, and they--all they had to do is just not give you a contract and you--didn't have to give you any reason.  As I say, she had been teaching for eleven years, one of the finest teachers in the system.  But, anyway, so we got another plaintiff, and this time, we filed a suit in the federal court.  And I filed the suit there in August of, of 1939, Alston v. School Board of the City of Norfolk [1940], and I was the local counsel and Thurgood Marshall, William [H.] Hastie, and Dr. [Leon A.] Ransom, who I mentioned before, were all lawyers.  And we, we--when we--they tried, hell, they couldn't get a hearing in there until, until Lincoln's birthday [February 12th] in 1940, and then Judge [Luther] Way ruled against us saying the same thing that they had claimed in the [Virginia] state court.  So at that time, we couldn't--and the only thing we had of, brought us any joy that day was a case came over the radio on the car, when we were driving back, in which, and it said, Hale versus Kentucky [Hale v. Kentucky, 1938], and that was a case Dr. Ransom had carried to the [U.S.] Supreme Court, and in which a Negro had been charged with murder and given the chair.  And the Supreme Court had overruled it.  And so, but it wasn't--but then when we looked into the situation, we found there was no way for us do--meet all the requirements for bringing a case before the full circuit within the time period between the April term of the court.  And so we, we thought, we said, we decided we had thought of everything we could think of, and then we decided to hold a meeting the Sunday before the last day of the week--of the term, of the term.  And Hastie--all of us were there, Hastie, Thurgood and two, two or three other members of the faculty.
Story_ID: 192010
Speaker 1: Had Constance Baker Motley or Robert [L.] Carter started working with you yet?
Speaker 2: No, see they, they--
Speaker 1: They came much later.
Speaker 2: They hadn't finished law school yet.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Well, in 1939, I think, I think Robert Carter may have finished in '38 [1938] and Constance Baily--I mean Baker, I mean Constance Motley didn't finish until--no, no, what I'm trying--I'm getting ahead of my story.  They, they didn't finish until, yeah, about '38 [1938]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Motley didn't finish until in the '50s [1950s] [sic, 1946].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway, well, you don't want a whole lot of detail, do you?  We, we finally appeared before the circuit court [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit] and asked them to hold a special term to hear our case.  And the ole fool, the chief judge [John J. Parker] barked back at me and said, "Say you want the government to go to the expense of, of hearing your, your case.  What's so special about your case?"  And that gave me an opening, and I told him what had happened the year before in the, in the Aline [Black]--in the female case, and what we feared, what was gon' in our case [Alston v. School Board of the City of Norfolk, 1940] unless we had a hearing so we can get the matter before the court, before it had a chance to--while he was still, while he was still a teacher.  And then, of course, the--oh, well, then [Morris Ames] Soper spoke up--the court at that time consisted of, of [John J.] Parker, [Armistead M.] Dobie and Soper.  Soper was from Baltimore--Maryland.  Parker was from North Carolina, and he was the chief judge, and Dobie was a former dean of the law school at University of Virginia [University of Virginia School of Law, Charlottesville, Virginia] and an authority on evidence and then, very sensitive man, he liked to spout a lot of Greek.
Story_ID: 192011
Speaker 1: Earlier I said, I couldn't think of the name of the plaintiff in the Democratic primary case, Democratic primary case.  It was the case of West versus Bliley [Bliley v. West, 1930], and Bliley, that was the same--Bliley was the secretary of the, of the Democratic Party, and he's ancestor to our, one of our present--a recent [Republican] representative in Congress [Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.].  They were big funeral directors [at Joseph W. Bliley, Co. Funeral Home] in, and they still are in Virginia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --in Richmond [Virginia].  But anyway, we finally had a hearing [at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit], I mean--it was real funny.  As I told you when, when [Chief Judge John J.] Parker barked at me, my knees were batting because that's the first time I'd ever appeared before an appellate court.  And, but anyway, when I told him what had happened, and [Morris Ames] Soper said, "Well, what you'd like to have is an injunction, isn't it?"  I said, "Yeah," any--of course, I'd take anything they're give us (laughter).  Now, we had to assess the injunction, but we felt that if we asked for an injunction in federal court, they would send us over--back over to the [Virginia] state court for an injunction, where we knew we wasn't gon' get one.  So we didn't--when he said injunction, then that's when the city attorney came jumping up and running up to the--he had sat back in the audience, he was so sure they were gon' blow me away early, he didn't even come to the bar, but he came running up there.  "Well, oh, you--we don't need no injunction, don't need no injunction."  So then they asked him if what I'd been saying was true, and he said, "Yes."  And so then they huddled and finally they came back and said, "Well, we're gon', we gon' tell you what we gon' do.  We gon' hold the matter open, and if you have any trouble with your client, if your client has any trouble with his tenure, you let us know, and we'll find a way to do something about it."  And, of course, as a consequence, nothing was done to give any of the teaching personnel contracts until after our case [Alston v. School Board of the City of Norfolk, 1940] had been heard and decided.  And the case was heard down in Nashville [Tennessee] in June of 1940.  And the court ruled with us.  And, and then, of course, we had a whole lot of skirmishing after that, but can't take up all the detail to talk about that.
Story_ID: 192012
Speaker 1: So that was our, we finally, that [Alston v. School Board of the City of Norfolk, 1940] gave us a precedence, and in the meantime, I filed suit against, over in Newport News [Virginia], and they came in with the same story, and, and (laughter), and a motion to dismiss.  And ole Way, Judge [Luther] Way heard the same, we had the same judge.  He said, "Oh, no.  When y'all came up with that argument over in Norfolk [Virginia]," and--in this court, he was talking to some different lawyers, but he said, "They came up with that same argument, and they carried me up to the Norfolk, to the Fourth Circuit and spanked me.  I ain't gon' get spanked no more," (laughter).  So, we going to trial, right now.  And so he was--of course, I was prepared to go to trial, and we went on to trial.  And so from that point on we were, we were off and moving.  And we had, we brought--we challenged every damn thing, particularly, the denial of Negroes to vote in the Democratic--I mean to vote in--to, to serve as plain and petty juries.  And then we had a lot of cases involving transportation.  Now, you've all heard of Rosa Parks.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But in 1943 a woman named Irene Morgan who lived in Gloucester [Massachusetts], but came to--she was in Baltimore [Maryland] at that time, she came down to visit her mother.  And she wasn't--her mother, when she got ready to go back home that Sunday night, she wasn't feeling too well and the bus filled up.  And they wanted her to get up and give her seat to a white man.  And she refused, and they dragged her off the bus and, and put her in jail.  And the next day, in police court, the judge found her guilty of resisting arrest and, and violating the segregation laws and fined a hundred dollars for resisting arrest and ten dollars for violating the segregation laws.  And she told him, "There's no question about it, I resisted arrest so I'll pay that hundred dollars, but that ten dollar fine for violating the segregation laws is unconstitutional, I think, and I'm gonna appeal it."  And so she went on and did that.  And then, went back, and in the meantime, we had filed a, we had formed a firm, Hill, Martin and Robinson.  Martin A. Martin, Martin Armstrong Martin, and Spottswood W. Robinson [III] who made the highest record of any student at Howard University [School of Law, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: So Spottswood Robinson, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and his, his record still stands.  He later became dean of the law school and during the Johnson administration [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], he became a district judge and was elevated to the [U.S.] Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, federal judi--for the District of Columbia.  And at the time he retired, he was chief judge of the, of that court.  But anyway, as I said, we were filing suits going and coming.  And in '39 [1939], they had organized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's [NAACP] Legal Defense and Educational Fund [Ink Fund].  And Thurgood [Thurgood Marshall] was director, the chief counsel for the NAACP and director of, of the, of the Ink Fund, we called it, NAACP [Legal] Defense Fund.  Well, Harry Berg [ph.] started rumbling and checking into it, and so we had to split the two organizations so as to protect the right of the Ink Fund to be a charitable organization and Charlie--I mean and Thurgood went with that, as the director of that.  And Robert [L.] Carter who was, had been his deputy became general counsel for the NAACP.  In our office was Thurgood--I mean Spot [Spottswood W. Robinson III] had been set up as a eastern division attorney for the NAAC[P]--for the Ink Fund, and I used to represent the NAACP.  But we all worked together.
Story_ID: 192013
Speaker 1: Go back to Irene Morgan.  So in 1943, I went in the [U.S.] Army, and the firm to, represented Irene Morgan through the Virginia courts, but nobody had been sufficiently qualified, qualified for the [U.S.] Supreme Court so that--and the case [Irene Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 1946] was appealed to the Supreme Court.  It was handled by William [H.] Hastie and Thurgood Marshall, and the court ruled that the segregation law, requiring segregation on transportation, interstate commerce--transportation, was unconstitutional as a burden on commerce.  They dodged the issue with respect to Plessy [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896], and so--but Irene Morgan was a very private person, and she didn't want to, any--be a symbol of anything.  So, what I'm saying is, that she did what people give Rosa Parks credit for doing, but Rosa Parks is entitled to all the adoration and honors that she's gotten because she sacrificed her privacy to be the symbol for, for this, but she wasn't--by the time she, when she was arrested, they had already had three or four plaintiffs ahead of her, and they had discarded all of 'em.  But, but, as I say, but she was still, and she sacrificed her privacy, and I say, she's entitled to, to the support that she's gotten.  Anyway, and you know what she--and not only that, she was attacked, you know, at one time by some daggone young fool, who was trying burglarize her, her home.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's Rosa Parks, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they had to take her to Detroit [Michigan].  What was the representative, what's his name?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] John Conyers?
Speaker 1: John Conyers, yeah.  And she worked for John Conyers there for a long time.
Speaker 2: Okay, sir, what about--.
Speaker 1: Oh, now, one--so, after that--but they still tried to enforce the darn thing, despite the law.  So they would arrest people coming down from, from Washington [D.C.] or up North or over on the coastline and seaboard, and they'd go before the police court judge, and he'd fine 'em, and we'd appeal the case up to (unclear) Hutchin's [ph.] court.  And the judge up at Hutchins's court would continue 'em.  And so finally, one day I said, "Judge, why don't you go ahead and decide one of these daggone cases so we appeal?" Said, "That's just it.  You all gon' to appeal, and I know and you know that one of these days the Supreme Court is gon' rule these things unconstitutional.  And they ain't gon' reverse me," so we had a whole flock of--
Speaker 2: That's incredible.
Speaker 1: --appeals, because we couldn't get him to move.  But anyway, one time, a man named [William C.] Chance.  He was head of a, principal of a school there in, in Rocky Mountain, North Carolina, just below the green line.  And for some reason or other, he refused to move, but they didn't arrest him in Richmond [Virginia].  And when they got down to Emporia [Virginia], they realized they hadn't, they hadn't arrested him (laughter), so they, they arrested him there.  And, and so when the matter came up for, for trial, Martin went down to the Emporia to represent him.
Speaker 2: That's Martin A. Martin?
Speaker 1: Martin A. Martin, yeah, and then, Martin was the lawyer to represent him.  The lawyer for the railroad [Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company] asked the court to dismiss the case and, and they paid the cost of court and everything.  So, so then when that happened, when we got back we filed suit, a civil suit against Chance, and they--we had a trial, and the court wouldn't, didn't, didn't carry the case [Chance v. Lambeth, 1951] out as we--didn't charge the jury as we thought he should.  And the jury ruled against--they ruled in favor of the defendant.  And we appealed to the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the] Fourth Circuit and reversed, the judge, and we came back for the second trial.  In the second trial, we ended up with a $50 judgment.  I mean they, they wanted first to--they really wanted to, to just give us a dollar, but there was a member of the jury who wouldn't agree to anything, and he finally got 'em up to fifty dollars, he said.  And the, the--that's the way it ended up.  And, of course, all we were concerned with was the, was the decision and having proved our case.  And so that's--that broke up the, the discrimination coming down on the railroad.
Story_ID: 192014
Speaker 1: --Yeah, I went to the [U.S.] Army in '43 [1943], and what, what precipitated that was, I filed a, request an application for a commission in the [U.S.] Navy, and, and all I did was get myself declared (laughter) drafted, that's all.  And they had me on, on imminent, called up in the Army.  I told 'em, hell, I couldn't, couldn't practice law and that's why I agreed--we worked out an agreement, and I would come into the Army in June.  And in the meantime, I'd gotten Spot [Spottswood W. Robinson III] to take, decide to take the bar [exam].  And we didn't have no problem worrying about Spots.  His father was a lawyer, and, and he, he was gon' hold things together until Spot got his--realized he had passed--I mean was advised he had passed the bar.  And that's what we did.  And as I say, we, in--in '43 [1943], we formed the firm of Hill, Martin and Robinson.  [Martin A.] Martin had--it's real funny.  Martin and I had been trying cases for two or three years prior to that time together, as only, on some ad hoc basis, and around anything that was outside of our bailiwick.  And we had had a case, it was a famous case known as [the Case of Odell] Waller.  The international, some, some organization known as International Lawyers [sic, Workers' Defense League] or something.  Anyway, we had the case, and they'd worked with, with--Martin had worked with 'em, and this man had, had challenged the--he was a tenant farmer, and he challenged the farmer, his boss [Oscar Davis] as to his wages.  He was, what you, what you call the thing [sic, sharecropping]?
Speaker 2: It was a--.
Speaker 1: You get a third of what, what you make.  But anyway, this, not being able to call up words that I want to call up is a pain in the neck, but anyway, they, they got in an argument, and the farmer produced a pistol, produced a firearm--I don't remember now whether it was a rifle or, or a pistol.  But anyway, and then they had a struggle over that, and he got killed.  And so when they tried [Odell] Waller and sent him to the electric chair.  And, and we had quite a to-do about that.  And we tried to get the governor [of Virginia, James H. Price] to, to suspend the sentence, not suspend the sentence, I mean to it--
Speaker 2: Stay of--to reduce it to life.
Speaker 1: Reduce it to life in prison, yeah.  But anyway, he didn't.  And--
Speaker 2: Now, what about--I think we're at the point where--can you look down a little bit?
Speaker 1: Oh, what I started to tell you was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so, they, they got job--Martin a job at the [U.S.] Department of Justice as, as an attorney.  They sent him out West, and he was prosecuting Germans, and he got dissatisfied with what they were doing, and he, he wrote me one time and said, "You want to"--well, this was before he got dissatisfied, he said, "You ought to come on and (unclear) and go on, and go on, come on into the Department of Justice 'cause otherwise, they want to draft you in the Army, and put you in engineers and send you down to Louisiana."  And that's just what they did (laughter).
Speaker 2: So his prediction came true?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: His prediction came true?
Speaker 1: Yeah, his prediction (unclear), yeah.  But it, in the meantime though, he got disgusted with what was happening, and he came back and I, while I was in basic training, and he joined the firm, Hill, Martin and Robinson.
Story_ID: 192015
Speaker 1: Now, can we skip to 1951 to Barbara Johns [of Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 1952]?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, we were--not, only, we had filed a lot of teacher salary cases, and we filed cases, they were getting Negroes, buses, right to get bus, bus travel.  And, and--
Speaker 1: Now, Barbara Johns was the daughter of Vernon Johns, right?
Speaker 2: Nah, she was, she was niece of Vernon Johns.
Speaker 1: Niece of Vernon--okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And they, well, in 1939, in Prince Edward County [Virginia] had built a new school known as [R. R.] Morton High School [Farmville, Virginia].  And the school was overcrowded the day it opened, to show you how much planning went into it.  And so to take up for the, to make up for the slack, they started putting up tar shack buildings and had pipes running from one building to another and had, had iron, big ole iron drums for the heat.  And so we have a very active member in Farmville [Virginia] named Dr. Miller [ph.], he was a dentist.  And he had me down there two or three times in the early part of, of the '40s [1940s], trying to challenge it, trying to get 'em to do something about it.  And anyway, when we came out the [U.S.] Army, they still hadn't done anything about it.  And we, we--in the meantime though, we had filed several other suits and Corbin versus Pulaski [Corbin v. County School Board of Pulaski County, VA, 1949] and there was dentist [Dr. P.C. Corbin] in Pulaski [Virginia] where, where his child [Mahatma Corbin] was required to go from Pulaski to Christiansburg [Virginia]. They had opened a consolidated school in Pittsburgh--in, in Christiansburg for the Pulaski, the town of Pulaski, the town of Radford [Virginia] and, and Montgomery County [Virginia] and Pulaski County [Virginia].  And they, they had no problems about consolidating many counties together and for purposes of, of segregation and busing children fifty and seventy-five and a hundred miles sometimes to, to get to these schools.  And in Sussex County [Virginia], they had the situation, they didn't even provide any busing.  They had to--kids had to either live in Waverly [Virginia]--that's where the school was located or at the expense of their parents or pay a, (unclear) I mean one, a Negro had bought a bus who was transporting kids around, and we learned about it, and, and we challenged, challenged that.  As a matter of fact, tried the case through Stony Court, I mean the Stony Court School [ph.] and demanded their entrance, their admission in nine--in 1942.  And I knew they weren't gonna admit him, so I had already prepared my case, and filed a suit in Richmond [Virginia] and had told the people to be sure and show their interest by coming up to, to Richmond.  And this was on a Monday, and I had the hearing set for Thursday.
Story_ID: 192016
Speaker 1: And so when we got up there [Richmond, Virginia] on, on Thursday, one of the deputy sheriffs, I mean deputy marshal, one of the marshals met me at the doors, "Judge [Alfred D. Barksdale] wanna see you in his chambers."  And I got to, up to the judge's chambers, the [Pulaski County, Virginia] school board and the judge and their lawyers were all sitting there in chambers.  I couldn't understand what was the problem--what the problem was, but anyway, judge said, "What's this matter you got here coming up?"  So I said, "Well, judge, we--you got this school sitting over in Waverly [Virginia].  It's forty-some miles from where my client, from where most of these children live.  And they don't have any bus transportation."  He said, well, just--I--"This don't belong in my court."  I said, "Yes, it does."  So then we got the book, and sure enough, he knew, and then I knew, it was in his--we were in the right juris--his court had jurisdiction over it.  Then he turned and said, "Well, you didn't give enough notice.  This, you only gave 'em four days' notice."  I said, "Well, you know, judge, I didn't need to give any notice at all.  I could have come here and asked you to give, for, for a restraining order 'cause obviously they were violating, violating the law."  And, boy, by that time, he was really mad, and he said, (laughter) "Y'all go out here, you the ones the lawyers, y'all go out here and settle this thing."  So we, we and so we had a meeting in, in Petersburg [Virginia] and the school, and the school board--and I had written 'em a letter before, before we file the suit, telling 'em that maybe we could discuss this matter, and I have an idea how they could handle it.  And they said, "Well, what's your idea?"  I said, "Oh, heck, I don't know now," and, of course, I was mad then too.  So, let's see, "I filed a teacher's salary case in your county, and you all fired the teacher."  And evidently when they said that, the chairman (unclear) jumping, the chairman jumping [ph.], "I told you not to fire that man, that girl.  I told you not to fire her," and he was mad then.  He, he said something smart to me, and I said something smart back at him, and he started across the table to me (laughter), and I'm starting after him, and [Martin A.] Martin grabbed me and pulled me back, and somebody pulled him back.  But we didn't, we didn't, we didn't get any satisfaction.  But anyway, they got, they got buses.  See back--this was in, this was in the early days of the War [World War Two, WWII], and you couldn't buy a automobile and anything unless--all, all vehicles, were for the use of the government.  You had to have special permission.  But I knew that if we told Harry Berg [ph.] that either he had to get some buses down there for those kids or else the Negro and white kids had to ride the same bus, he was gon' do something about it.  And so, that was what I had in mind, but they got, they got the buses all right.  I don't know where I was before.  I started off--
Speaker 2: Well, we were talking about Barbara Johns [of Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 1952] before we were talking that.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we started with Barbara Johns.  So, yeah, yeah, this was really a, a very messy deal over in Prince Edward [County, Virginia] because the main building [at R. R. Morton High School, Farmville, Virginia] was fairly well heated, but in inclement weather, whether you're going from one of the tar hill, tar sheds or whether you were going from the main building, you had to slush through the bad weather, and the kids were getting colds some days.  And it was decided the thing was inherently very dangerous, darn shacks could catch a fire any time.  And so Barbara Johns had organized the children in her class, and they pulled a ruse, they got the principal away from, from the school by telling him, supposedly had sent--he was, superintendent wanted to see him down his office.  And then she called all the kids together and said, "Now let's go on a strike."  That is the senior class.  It wasn't--and they all went out on a strike--
Story_ID: 192017
Speaker 1: Let me tell you this.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.
Speaker 1: You know I told you that everything, everybody was so agitated in the Sussex [Country, Virginia] matter, Sussex case, Sussex County case, and I couldn't, couldn't imagine what it was but I went back and got in the, in the main courtroom, what had happened was, I had told them to come up there and show their interests.  Well, they come up there with two busloads of Negroes, and the courtroom was--all the seats were occupied, and they were standing up around the walls (laughter).  So that's what scared them, scared 'em to death and had 'em all, all stirred up.
Speaker 2: That's good.  I mean, how did they get organized like that?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: How, how did the black people--?
Speaker 1: Well, see this nonsense about, it was the lawyer stirring up, I mean, and the lawyers is the only one showing any interests, people were interested back in those days in, in getting their children an opportunity to go to school and get some decent edu-education.  One time I had a daggone, a superintendent on the school, on the, on the stand from up--from Prince George County [Virginia].  And I asked him, "Why is it that y'all call secondary schools for white children high schools and call the secondary schools for Negro children training schools?"  And he said, "Well, we--white students go on, go on to college and things.  We--the Negro children, we train 'em to get jobs at doing what they can--train 'em to do things they can get jobs doing."  And which was all, always menial work, and no such thing as--of course, electricity and, and electrical things and a lot of new things were coming out, that they taught in the laboratories, and science laboratories and things in the white schools.  But all they had was general science and general this and nothing like, in the Negro schools.  So this nonsense about Negroes weren't interested is for the birds.
Story_ID: 192018
Speaker 1: Now, coming on back to, to Barbara Johns, she called about five o'clock in the evening, and we had a--we were, [Martin A.] Martin and, and Spot [Spottswood W. Robinson III] and I were sitting in our library preparing a petition for further progress of, for further action in a case known as Corbin versus Pulaski [Corbin v. County School Board of Pulaski County, VA, 1949], and I happened to be closest to the telephone.  And I answered it, and she [Barbara Johns] told me they were out on strike and what they had done.  And I congratulated 'em, told them that was fine.  Now, that they proved a point, go on back to school the next day.  So she said, no--she pleaded so hard.  So I said, "Well, all right, I'll tell you what's gon' happen.  We're going up to Christiansburg [Virginia] on--this was Monday evening, Monday afternoon, and we were going up to Christiansburg on, on Wednesday morning.  And we would leave a little early and come by Reverend [L. Francis] Griffin's church and meet with 'em.  We'd have a meeting at Reverend Griffin's church."  And that's what we did.  We had Martin and Spot and Dr. Thomas Henderson who was--he was Dean Henderson at that time, and he was one of our expert witnesses and another fellow, and a photographer named Broadnax [ph.], One-Shot Broadnax, we called him 'cause Broadnax, most, most people want to take two or three shots.  Broadnax would cock his camera up there, bam, shoot it, and that's, that's--and he had it.  And not only that, he actually had it.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've heard of him.  I've heard of him around.
Speaker 1: One-shot Broadnax, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And so anyway we got, when we got to Farmville [Virginia], when we got to the church, the kids were, we were planning, we were still--on our way up there, and we said, "Well, we're gon' tell 'em to go on back to school."  But the kids were so well organized and had such high morale and all, we didn't have the nerve to--I mean not the nerve, the--we just couldn't, couldn't break their spirit.  So we told 'em that, we were no longer filing suits on separate but equal, and now we were going after segregation per se.  And if their parents would back 'em, they would--we would, we'd take the case.  And we'd be coming back through there Thursday night and have their parents there.  And we, we'd reach a conclusion.  And on Thursday night when we came back through Farmville, the parents--they were there with their parents and the parents were willing to back 'em, want to challenge the segregation, per se.  And, but then finally somebody spoke up, this is a matter--this is gonna be a matter that affects the whole county [Prince Edward County, Virginia].  Maybe we ought to--if it's a county matter, maybe we ought to have a county meeting.  So we agreed to meet Friday week.  See, the next day would be Friday, but the week, the following, following Friday.  And when that Friday--this, all these meetings--this little meeting was held in the Sunday school room.  But the next Friday, they met in, in the sanctuary of the church.  When we got there, the church was filled and they had people standing around, standing in the aisles.  And so it was a big discussion and overwhelmingly people were for going forward with the suit.  The only strong opposition was--raised, was by a man who was principal of the school, of a high school in Cumberland [Virginia] who lived in Prince Edward County, and, and he, he put up a fight about we ought give 'em a little more time, that they, they got plans for, for building a--they say they got plans for building another new school and all that stuff.  But anyway, we brushed him aside.  And so then we--that's the way the suit got started.  And we filed a petition on behalf of, of the kids that were given to us--names that were given to us for plaintiffs.  And we made one big mistake, and that is, we used, wrote the, wrote the plaintiffs down alphabetically, and as we usually did.  But instead of making Barbara Johns as the lead plaintiff, but other than that--of course, it didn't take 'em long to--they came back with a, with a long, to-do about what the state [of Virginia] was gon' do and what, and what they had plans to do, two or three years, in, within two or three years.  So we went on and filed suit.  That's the way the Prince Edwards case got started.  Of course, we would--people asked us why did we start a case down in Prince Edward?  Well, we, we never would have started the case in Prince Edward if, if it had--if we were gon' pick out the case ourselves.
Speaker 2: The case picked itself out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We would have started in Richmond [Virginia] or Norfolk [Virginia] or somewhere.
Speaker 2: So the circumstances just kind of picked itself--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: The circumstances made it, no other choice?
Speaker 1: People, people determined what we did.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 192019
Speaker 1: Okay, now, as I said, we, we--
Speaker 2: Now, now, when it came down--of course, now there was, we challenged the constitutionality of a [Virginia] state statute and that under the law required a three judge, what we called a three-judge statutory court.  And so we filed, and set the suit and the case [Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 1952], when the case came for trial, we had already--first, one of the things we had told Barbara Johns, and why I told 'em to go back to school was because we had already filed suit.  That is, when I say, "we", I'm talking about the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], we filed suit in Clarendon County, South Carolina, Briggs versus Elliott [Briggs v. Elliott, 1952].  And it was, and I told her we didn't need but one suit to establish the precedent.  But, but that case went up to the [U.S.] Supreme Court, and on a technicality--I've forgotten what it was now, and it was sent back.  And by the time it came back to, to the court, when the Prince Edwards case [Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 1952] had come up, and the Kansas case, Brown versus Topeka, Kansas [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and a case Delaware [sic, two cases, Belton v. Gebhart, 1952 and Bulah v. Gebhart, 1952].  We had a case in Delaware, the court, district court had ruled for the plaintiffs.  So it was the school board appealing in Delaware, and then the other, other case [Bolling v. Sharpe, 1954] was from the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].  And that was under the Fifth Amendment 'cause the District of Columbia was not a state, and the Fourteenth Amendment didn't apply but rather, the Fifth Amendment did.  And so there--that's where the five cases came.  And three, three cases, Kansas, Davis and Briggs were, were all similar, similar cases.  Beau--I'm trying to remember what was the local counsel in, in South Carolina, Beaumont [ph.].  He later became a, he later became a judge down there in, in general district court.  But they, they were worse than--down there, when we filed the suit, they burned the school down and, and the principal of the school had to get out of town, just two or three minutes ahead of a mob.
Story_ID: 192020
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Charles [Hamilton] Houston died in 1950, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Just as all these cases were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See, Charles Houston, Charles Houston was, had the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] case [Bolling v. Sharpe, 1954].  So when he got so sick, he turned the thing over to, to Jim Nabrit [James Nabrit, Jr.] and George Hayes, and that's the way they got into it.  But Jim and George handled the case, yeah.  And, of course, there were--I can't, this boy at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] now on the faculty then (unclear), oh shucks, he had become a young lawyer and he was, he was also involved.  Of course, a lot of people who got involved on the cases, on the cases, working on the, working on briefs.  That's where Constance, Constance Motley [Constance Baker Motley] was working on the brief.  And we had three, three white lawyers who were very strong, district judge, oh, hell, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and--
Speaker 1: Not Wofford, was it?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Not Harris Wofford, was it?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, he, he--Harris Wofford was a graduate of Howard University Law School [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], but he was much later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of 'em was named Charles Black.  He died a couple of years ago--two or three years ago.  He was, and he was a great, wonderful man, very brilliant lawyer and a poet, a musician (laughter).  And he played violin wonderfully, and his wife [Barbara Aronstein Black] later became dean of Hale--Yale Law School [sic, dean of Columbia Law School, New York, New York].  And, and he, and one--oh, hell, these other two--one was--the other two, one is a district judge in Philadelphia and the other one is a district judge in Brooklyn [New York, New York].  Maybe before we leave here it'll pop in my mind.
Speaker 1: It's in your book ['The Big Bang: Brown vs Board of Education, and Beyond: The Autobiography of Oliver W. Hill, Sr.'], right?  Is it in your book?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 192021
Speaker 1: Can you tell us, can you kind of walk us through the Brown versus the Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] case and summarize that one for us?
Speaker 2: Well, we filed suit, and we argued, the case was argued, and, and then, we thought--well, put it this way, and what prompted us to bring the suit at the time we did was, the law school--we filed a suit law, law--in a case involving law school [The University of Texas School of Law, Austin, Texas] in Texas.
Speaker 1: Oh, Sweatt versus Painter [Sweatt v. Painter, 1950].
Speaker 2: Sweatt versus Painter, and they had, instead of denying him [Heman Marion Sweatt] they, what they did was they opened up a storefront, separate school--
Speaker 1: Right (laughter).
Speaker 2: --and named it law school.  It had one teacher, a couple of books, and that was it.  And we, we contended that did not constitute a law school, and that we'd set up in our brief all the requirements for a first-class law school that was had at the Texas Law School [The University of Texas School of Law, Austin, Texas].  And in his, in his decision, declared, in ruling for us in that case, Judge Vince--Justice [Fred M.] Vinson, he was the Chief Justice for the United States [Supreme Court] at that time, he went down the line of what we said constituted a valid law school.  And so we, we felt we finally got the court on our side completely.  I mean, you know, we--they were dishing--dipping and dodging, as I you reverse one thing and then another.  But never challenging Plessy [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896] per se.  So, so then we filed a suit.  Later we found that Vinson was not in our corner on, on this issues 'cause, you see, children, you'll be surprised--Hutchinson [ph.] was one of the finest judges you ever had in this, in--federal judges we had.  But he could not bring himself to rule in favor of Negro children and white children going together in school.  We had a lawyer down in Norfolk [Virginia], Victor Ashe, brought suit on behalf of children down, down in Norfolk.  And, and when [President Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower came in, he and appointed, well, well he died, and he appointed--oh, hell, I couldn't--(laughter) the only thing I can think of Biff, we called him Biff.  But anyway, the judge tried to be fair, and then he found out his family was being ostracized.  He was being held, critic (unclear), so he started holding up on things.  And that was what the situation was.
Story_ID: 192022
Speaker 1: Anyway, going back to, to the [U.S.] Supreme Court [case, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], so what happened was they finally, Felix Frankfurter wanted to be, vote with us, but see, he was also, interesting, disturbed by Jews being too out, too out in front on this issue.  And everybody was trying to--
Speaker 2: Okay, he didn't want Jews to be condemned for being too far left on--
Speaker 1: That's right.  Every, everybody, everybody was trying to pacify, trying to pacify the South and do what was right at the same time, and it's just impossible.  And so he suggested that we, to, to postpone the thing for a while.  And by asking us to, to re-brief the case and, oh, and they asked a lot, they asked us about, oh, 1,500--I don't know how many historical questions, that we had to answer.  So we had to engage a lot of historians to do a lot of work, [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin was one of 'em, [C. Vann] Woodward, outstanding historian was another, and in the meantime, and I forgot to call your attention to the fact that in the, in the, in the district--in the first case [Briggs v. Elliott, 1952], a young teacher [John A. Davis] over at Lincoln [University, Jefferson City, Missouri] and [Robert L.] Bob Carter had gotten together.  And they decided that we ought to get some psycho--psychological evidence in.  And so they got eminent psychologist--I can't think of his name again--
Speaker 2: Kenneth Clark.
Speaker 1: Jim Clark, huh?
Speaker 2: Kenneth Clark.
Speaker 1: Kenneth Clark, yeah, and Mabel [sic, Mamie], his wife, both of 'em were, were psychologists, and they conducted the doll test [sic, experiment].
Speaker 2: Now, what was the doll test?  What was that?
Speaker 1: The doll test was they had black dolls and white dolls.  And they would ask the children, well, which was the good doll and which was the bad doll?  And, of course, most of 'em would pick out the white doll.
Speaker 2: The white doll was the good one, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And we, we submitted this, they had a lot of the questions.  And on, and the kids--see, that's one of the things about the daggone segregation.  It not only isolated you, but they also did everything they could to make Negroes, try to make Negroes believe that they were inferior.  And it did have some effect on a whole lot of, whole of Negroes, especially, especially small children.  So anyway--and then they--we had psychologists to do surveys, and give their work, give the result of their surveys.  In the, in the South Carolina case, they did the doll test, and in the Virginia case we had the dolls.  And we also had a Jewish psychologist at the (unclear), who was one of the, of the lawyers for the, for the defendant, (unclear) Atrie [ph.].  He tried to be as rough as he could on, on this particular psychologist.  You have to--I can't remember his name either.  But anyway we had that kind of psychological evidence.  And, and the Supreme Court, it had an effect on the, on the Supreme Court in the final result of the Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] case.
Story_ID: 192023
Speaker 1: Tell us about when you finally got the result of the Brown case [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], I mean the facts leading up to it, and what you--and the final verdict?
Speaker 2: Well, well, like I said now, thought their case had to be--but in the meantime, [Fred M.] Vinson died between the first, first argument and the re-argument on it.  And that's when we got, oh, shucks--
Speaker 1: I know who you're talking about.  I can't--
Speaker 2: The Chief Justice of the United States [Supreme Court].
Speaker 1: Earl Warren.
Speaker 2: Earl Warren, and, and, of course, doctor--Justice Warren admitted that they had made a big mistake, in, in not--just, 'cause, see, originally, when the [U.S.] Supreme Court decided that something was unconstitutional, they sent the mandate down to correct it.  But in the Brown case, they didn't.  They held it over for, further argument on the remedy.  And when it got down to the remedy, they came up--and this was, this was [Felix] Frankfurter's idea, you know, "All deliberate speed".  And white folks took that to mean go as slow as you want to.  And, and at that time, we recognized the fact that Frankfurter was a, sort of a swing man as indicated.  We had, we had four showboats, but we needed a fifth one.  And, and Frankfurter had a Negro law clerk, [HistoryMaker William T.] Coleman [Jr.], who later became president of the, of the [NAACP] Legal Defense Fund.  Now, he was, he was also, had a lot of effect on Thurgood [Marshall] in, in making some of his decisions.  But, but anyway--.
Speaker 1: That's William Coleman?
Speaker 2: William Coleman, yeah, Bill Coleman.  He's still active around.  He's still a big Republican.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what you're telling us is that, that the court really set it up where the implementation of the decision was protracted over many years?
Speaker 2: Well, see what, see what they did was they said deliberate speed, and then turned the thing back, sent it back to district courts to administer it.  And that's when, instead of--in the meantime, in Virginia, they took the lead in setting up massive resistance, and they called a special meeting and all the Southern states.  And was in Virginia, and then the judge, ole Judge [Howard W.] Smith, who was a member of the House of the Repre--House of Representatives, was from Alexandria, Virginia.  And he, he wrote a, what was known as a Southern crest Manifesto [sic, The Declaration of Constitutional Principles, or the Southern Manifesto].  And all the Southern representatives and senators signed it, except in Virginia everybody signed it, but in, in Tennessee, [Al] Gore's father [Albert Gore, Sr.] didn't sign it.  [Estes] Kefauver and, and, oh, shucks, Great Society (clock chiming) judge.
Speaker 1: [President Lyndon Baines] Johnson.
Speaker 2: Who was [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy's vice president?
Speaker 1: Johnson, Lyndon Johnson.
Speaker 2: Johnson, Johnson did not sign it.  But everybody else in society [the South] signed it, all around, all over the South.  And what did ole Strom [Strom Thurmond] do, was fight the decision, "by all lawful means."  You know, how you gon' lawfully fight the law.
Story_ID: 192024
Speaker 1: So now, I mean it took like, we were saying earlier, it took twenty-eight years to really fight through all of those (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, it took longer than that.  It took twenty-four years to get them to hold that the Plessy versus Ferguson [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896] was unconstitutional.  Then on top of that we got the flawed decision in the original decision and flawed decision in, in the remedy, and we also ran into massive, massive resistance.  And the court didn't, eventually do anything until the New Kent [County, Virginia] case [Charles C. Green et al. v. County School Board of New Kent County, Virginia, 1968] in the late '60s [1960s].  That was handled by--did, did Samuel Marsh [sic, HM Henry L. Marsh, III] tell you about that.  That was handled by [Samuel W.] Tucker and [HistoryMaker Henry L.] Marsh [III].
Speaker 1: Right, Marsh did tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then that's when the court finally said, well, enough is enough, and but that didn't stop them from--did he tell you about, did he tell you we filed a suit in Richmond [Virginia] on behalf of Dorothy Callaway's [ph.] children and Alice [ph.] later became a member of the school board, in which they (unclear) swore not to go to a school Lee Street and go to a school up on Brookland Park Boulevard [Richmond, Virginia], Chamberlain--Chandler [Junior High] School on Brookland Park Boulevard.  And it was, I think it was Armstrong [High School, Richmond Virginia] where they would go to on Lee Street [Richmond, Virginia], and they had the People's Placement Board [sic, Virginia Pupil Placement Board].  You had to, you had to--if you wanted to go to a deseg--didn't, didn't go to the school they ordinarily assigned you to, you had to make an application to the People's Placement Board, and when we applied for, for these kids to go to these schools, they had--this appeared in the newspaper, had pictures of the representatives of the People's Placement Board down on their knees with a ruler, measuring the inches that they were close, these kids, that--their residence,  of the Calloway's so many inches closer to Lee Street than it was to the school up on Brookland, Chandler up on Brookland Boulevard.  (Laughter) And therefore, they ruled it--and we filed, we had to file suit there.  But if anybody had showed them before that was decided, we finally broke down the situation and, and they accepted two girls [Gloria Jean Mead and Carol Irene Swann] initially.  And then the next year, they accepted several of them, including my son.
Story_ID: 192025
Speaker 1: People talk about, you know, they talk about civil rights, they start talking about [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and the '60s [1960s] and the sit-ins and all that sort of thing, but the--until we were able to declare Plessy versus Ferguson [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896] unlawful, they, they wouldn't have gotten to first base.  As long as, as long as it was lawful for 'em to isolate Negroes, you couldn't do anything about it.  And as a matter of fact, so far as civil rights is concerned, if you notice, that's--Negroes have been fighting for civil rights ever since around 1830 or '40s [1840s], somewhere in--I mean not eighteen, sixteen [1630 or 1640].  When, when did we land here, 1607?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I mean, about around 1607, I mean the 1630s, like that.  See, when we--modern research shows that Negroes first came here as indentured servants, along with the white folks in 1607.
Speaker 2: Right, you're right.
Speaker 1: And, and, but since they were in a strange place and didn't know the language, didn't know where they were or anything, a lot of people took advantage of 'em and turned them into slaves.  And, and there was a--there were several things that started it, but one of the things was Negro, freed Negro, and had a child by a slave girl, and he filed suit in general court asking 'em to declare the boy freed so that he'd be a, could be a Christian.  And, and they did.  They granted his freedom, and, and as a matter of fact, the first case challenging slavery was one Negro suing another Negro, here in Virginia [bells chiming].  So, we, and I say, Negroes finally, they joined up the--'cause we were running, running away.  The [Great] Dismal Swamp down in Tidewater [North Carolina] that's loaded with runaway slaves and, and Indians [Native Americans].  As, as a matter of fact, my paternal grandmother was half Negro and half Indian.  And so we've got realize that.  You can't say--they talk about we should have challenged segregation sooner.  Heck, Charlie [Charles Hamilton Houston] said, we'd be batting our heads up against a stone wall and they later actually proved him right.  After twenty-four years, we finally got the decision, and they came up with massive resistance.  [Thomas B.] Stanley called a case, the governor, the governor of Virginia, when the decision [of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] came out, the governor was Stanley, his name was Stanley.  And he called a meeting of us, invited a number of Negroes, including Dr. Tinley [ph.] and [W.] Lester Banks and me, and he wanted us to--now that you, he came up with, "Now that you won your point, now, just let everything ride for a while."  I said what is--I told him, I said, "Hell, if we did that, then what y'all gon' say is, 'That proves that these Negroes didn't want it. It was just the lawyers.'  That's what you been saying all the time."  And even the most conservative of the Negroes in the group were--a lawyer, I mean a man named [P. B. Young]--who ran The Norfolk Journal and Guide [later, New Journal and Guide] and another editor who ran a paper over in Roanoke [Virginia].  And they, even they disagreed that there's no such thing as just, just doing nothing.

Speaker 1: The year 2004 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  Do you have any reflections on that?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, we got a whole lot of things planned.  I've got--starting in January, things to attend.  We, we plan, we plan to have, being in each one of the cities, one of the principal cities in Virginia.  But I'm sure they're gon' have--you know I got a president's--they have a president's commission, and they're gon' have something down in South Carolina.  And we're--it's gonna be, they're gon' have a celebration down in Farmville [Virginia], at Longwood [University, Farmville, Virginia].  And the [NAACP] Legal Defense Fund is planning, along with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] plan to have a big to-do on the seventeenth, May 17th in Washington [D.C.] at the [John F.] Kennedy Center [For the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.].  And, of course, the, the Kansas group is planning to have a big celebration in Kansas.  I think they have--they're planning two or three days I think.  But, and there're several meetings in February and several meetings in March.  And we're also planning to have--and we're working on it, the University of Richmond [Richmond, Virginia] and the University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut] if they stick with us.  And then there's the Negro--African who has a mandate from the United Nations.  He has an institute, his connection there.  We're gonna have a big celebration here, if I can get the money.  I'm trying, trying to get some money to have a satellite connection between this conference--we're gon' bring some Africans from South Africa, and we're gon' bring some (unclear) Indians from India.  But we're gonna try to hold a satellite session so as we can--that'll be dispensed in South Africa and in India by satellite.

Speaker 1: Sir, at this juncture, when you look back on what you've done, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I tried to, to, to eliminate segregation in all forms.  As a matter of fact, what I, I've devoted my life to trying to get people to understand that we, we should regard ourselves as human earthlings, you see.  And all of this nonsense about--you don't need all these daggone little countries.  What we really need is world government and, and regional, regional and some local interests.  But, and the other thing we got to, to discharge is war.  There's no war that ever settled anything, except prepared the way for the next one.  And, and think of the money that's wasted in, and you waste money preparing for war.  You waste money if you hold the war.  You waste money if you don't have the war 'cause all the stuff you've developed in preparation for war, if you don't use it, it becomes obsolete.  And then you got to spend a whole lot of money, like we spend billions of dollars trying to, to put, trying to--stuff out there in Nevada.  And they--Nevada don't want it, and nobody else wants it.  So, and suppose we use that money to do things to educate people, to feed people and to, people--proper, proper medical attention.  We ought to have clinics for prenatal care for maternal people, and we ought to have post-natal care.  We know, we've been knowing ever since nineteen--in the 1930s that there's great differences between children when they're exposed to light and air and, and sunlight as opposed to those--what, what happened was they, they observed in an orphanage that the kids who were on, on the side of the building, up against another building were much slower and, and less developed than the kids on the other side who were open--where it was open and windows and things.  And, and also now, one of the modern studies, they determined that just to stroke a child and to help to rub creases in his brain, which helps to, helps to develop him.  I mean so, all children should have the benefit of whatever the most modern matters that can be established as the best interests to people.  And if we do away with war, we won't be wasting a whole lot of money doing those things.  And, and we also got to recognize the fact that we can't compete for everything.  Why should people have to compete for food or water, air?  We need, we need to think in terms of cooperation on some of these things.  And that's what I'm writing on now.
Story_ID: 192028
Speaker 1: --And the other thing about it is that we also got to know what happened in history instead of being, developing a whole lot of myths.  I mean, for example, people originally though that the earth was, that the planet, the planet--the earth was flat, even learned men, like Aristotle and Plato and Socrates and among the Greeks.  But, and they even disputed the fact that the, that the atom--that matter was contained, out of atoms.  And, but now, that didn't say that they were dummies.  They believed that because, they believed those things 'cause that's the extent of knowledge in those days.  But the man, the archbishop of, of--who did a study of the begots [ph.], who studied and knew Greek and Latin and all and then took the bible and came down and determined that based on the, on the readings of the bible, that the world was 4,000 and some years old.  Now, he was, wasn't a dummy.  He was a smart man, but he was basing it on information that they had at that time.  And we got to look at things that, what the people said and did at that time.  But we recognize now, for example, I've written a paper on Robert E. Lee.  Robert E. Lee and the confederates, he was a confederate, a confederate general.  He never was a general.  He, he was--the highest rank he ever held to command troops in the union army was lieutenant colonel.  They invited him to--[President Abraham] Lincoln invited him to Washington [D.C.] and made him a colonel, and then offered him to be commanding officer of the, of the troops that he was getting together to resist the confederacy that was being organized in the South.
Speaker 2: So you think, like too many people are operating on the wrong premise, so they get the wrong--?
Speaker 1: Well, nah, they--see in this country, we've never--we talk about democracy.  We've never been a democracy.  This country started off as a slave-holding country.  If you read the [U.S.] Constitution, it provides for the continuation and the importation of slaves for twenty years after the adoption of the Constitution.  And it also provided that if a slave--I call, I call 'em refugees from uncompensated labor, went to, went to a free state, the full majesty of the federal government judicial system could be brought by the slaveholder to bring back, to, to recover his property.  And Negroes--I mean white folks have been regarding Negroes as property ever since 1787--1687, I'm sorry.  And, and he provides by law to--slaves could be dismembered, hands cut off, their arm cut off, a foot cut off, and assembled with other slaves so it would teach 'em a lesson, don't run away.  But on, in the meantime, if a indentured servant, white, ran away and was captured, he just had the time he was gone added to his, to his sentence of servitude.

Speaker 1: Sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: The first thing, you got to stop thinking in terms of black, just start thinking in terms of human earthlings.  That's the next thing we can--you can't, you can't--that's the trouble now.  And people divided up on religion and divided up on nationality, and all these things.  The earth is a, is a planet, floating around in, in the sky, like all the other planets are up there floating around.  The only reason we, we see the same thing all the time is because we're all moving at, revolving at the same rate of speed.  But we could recognize that fact.  The Bible was just wrong when it said, "In the beginning, God created heavens and earth," which implies that the earth is something different from the rest of the heavens.  We just, we're just as much a heavenly body--the earth is just as much a heavenly body as Mars and Venus or any other planet up there.  And the reason we see--look up, and we--and it's not--we don't look up, we look out and over.  If you go out in space, you don't look up, you look out and over from one planet to another.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to be remembered as just a person who, who did all he could, with what talent he had, to make life better for himself, his family and for other people.  That's the reason I say--I believe in evolution.  We know things is gon' change.  I could well be wrong about the big bang, but that's a theory 'cause it certainly wasn't the beginning 'cause it had to be something to bang.  Start it, but you gotta start somewhere.
Speaker 1: And that's the name of your book too, isn't it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'The Big Bang' ['The Big Bang: Brown V. Board Of Education And Beyond: The Autobiography of Oliver W. Hill, Sr.'].
Speaker 2: --'And Beyond.'
Speaker 1: Why did you name your book the 'Big Bang?'
Speaker 2: Oh well, you have to ask, you have to ask Jon [Jonathan K. Stubbs], he's the one named it.
Speaker 1: Oh, he did the naming? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
