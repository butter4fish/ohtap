Speaker 2: Yes, yes we're like the first so-called hip hop act to you know first to go gold, first to go platinum, first on the cover of Rolling Stones [Rolling Stone] first on 'American Bandstand' so everything that hip hop is now doing commercially and as a genre and as a business, Run-DMC they say was the first to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what is today's date?

Story_ID: 521092
Speaker 1: All right now before we get started, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up--
Speaker 2: Oh wow.
Speaker 1: --and the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Not really.  Well it's because it's not food.  My favorite thing to eat is sweets believe it or not, apple pie, rice pudding and red velvet cake.  That's my favorite thing.  'Cause people, "That's not food," but that's what I want to eat but I do eat you know vegetables and fish and chicken.  I love a good steak from time to time, but my favorite thing to eat is definitely sweets.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is black.
Speaker 1: All right.  Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: All times of the year.  I love winter, I love fall, I love spring, I love summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Never went on vacations as you know on my own.  When I was little my mother and father [McDaniels' adoptive parents, Bannah Griffin McDaniels and Byford McDaniels] used to always take us up to Montreal, Canada, but as of now you know on my own, I mean my whole life is a vacation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite phrase or saying?  No I don't really have no favorite phrases or sayings.
Story_ID: 521093
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side.  Now I know you have a situation that you were, you have two mothers, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. I found out that I was adopted when I was thirty-five years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you--we'll start with your birth mother, I guess--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us her full--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: All right so I'm gonna ask about your family history--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --your mother's side and father's side.  Let's start with your birth mother's side of the family?  Can you give us her full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My birth mother's name is Berncenia Lovelace, B-E-R-N-C-E-N-I-A, Lovelace, L-O-V-L-A-C-E [sic.].
Speaker 1: All right and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know any of that right now.  'Cause I just--I met my birth mother in 2004 and fortunately we have a great relationship because 99, 98 percent of, you know, reunions don't go good all the time.  But when I met my birth mother fortunately it went good so we're still in the process of getting to know each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know none of the statistical details about her but we speak often.  We go to dinner and we visit each other.  Not often but you know since I found her, I think, I probably seen her maybe eight times since 2004 so I don't know any details about her life.  I'm getting to know her.  I know one thing, she's a great, great person and what's real crazy is when I first walked into her house, she had this same exact Buddhist statue that I had.  She had the same, a lot of the same metaphysical books that I read, that I've read and on her right arm, this is Zuri, which is Swahili.  My wife's name [Zuri Alston McDaniels] which is Swahili for the word beautiful, my birth mother has the Peruvian symbol for beautiful on her right arm.  So right now it's still--we're still getting to know each other but as two people involved in a weird transaction rediscovering each other has been a blessing.
Speaker 1: Now there's probably some things you know as you that probably would be helpful--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --one thing is was she born and raised in New York [New York] as far as you know?
Speaker 2: No, she--her family is from Virginia.  Her family is from Virginia.
Speaker 1: So she--she moved to New York as a child or as?
Speaker 2: I know that she was living in Harlem [New York, New York].  She was living in Hamilton Heights [New York, New York] as a, as a child and her father moved them from Hamilton Heights in New York City to Staten Island [New York].  That's where I met her when we you know when I did the search for her and what happened with her she was living in Hamilton Heights up in Harlem.  She had my brother when she was eighteen years old, my brother Mark [ph.], and he was raised by her and her parents.  Three years later, she came home pregnant with me and it was no way that they could take another baby into that household, so she put me up for adoption.
Speaker 1: There was another issue too somewhere I read that the father was someone that her father didn't like very well much right or someone he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I mean yeah, I mean she, she had, she had, she had various relationships that had different fathers for my siblings and stuff like that but it was a shaky situation.  But for me it was like, "Don't come home pregnant again," and then three years later she came home pregnant.  It was no way they could bring me into the household, so she put me up for adoption.
Story_ID: 521094
Speaker 1: Now did she have any control over where you, who adopted you, or?
Speaker 2: No.  No, no I don't know too many of the details about my adoption.  I mean from what my mother [McDaniels' adoptive mother, Bannah Griffin McDaniels] told me 'cause she--well my mother told me it was a--I think it was through the Catholic charity [Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York] or whatever like that.  But it's crazy when my mother and father [McDaniels' adoptive father, Byford McDaniels] went to adopt me, or my mother and father, because my mother and father spoke with her mother during the adoption.  They didn't speak with her and because my birth mother was living in Hamilton Heights [New York, New York] at the time, you know Washington Heights [New York, New York] there's a lot of Dominicans up there.  So when, when my mother and father revealed to me at thirty-five that I was adopted, which was a big huge shock to me, they vaguely remember, they didn't say her name was Berncenia [Berncenia Lovelace], they said we think your mother's name is Bernada [ph.] and we think that you're Dominican.  So when they revealed this to me for five years I ran around saying I was Dominican because it was all about identity.  You know I had no idea.
Speaker 1: Well you can pass for a Dominican.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  And and you know Jam Master Jay rest in peace, he even said, he said, "You know what D [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] you know you look Dominican or whatever."  But my wife [Zuri Alston McDaniels] she said, "D don't you think," 'cause you know women has wisdom, "don't you think before you run around telling people that you're Dominican, you should make sure, you know you should verify that and confirm--." "Oh no don't worry about nothing my mother--," 'cause you know I love my mother and father, "they know what they talking about," so for five years until I ran, until I actually found my birth mother, I was running around, I had t-shirts that said, yo soy Latino.  I was doing interviews in all the Latin, Latin magazines.  They was even gonna make me the grand marshal of the Dominican Day Parade.  I called my publicist up and I was like, "Get me the name of a huge Dominican music--," "Why?"  "Because I'm gonna go make a record with them."  So my identity was all over the place when my mother and father told me I was Dominican.  But my birth mother, she, she was living in Hamilton Heights and my mother and father wanted to put two and two together.  I mean unfortunately my mother and father passed away, my adopted mother and father passed away before I was able to sit down and get into details of when was my adoption?  Who, what, this and that.  Matter of fact my brother [McDaniels' adoptive brother, Alford McDaniels] just hit me two days ago.  I gotta go down to the house where they--when they left New York [New York], they moved down in South Carolina so I'm sure somewhere in the closets in those file cabinets will be all those papers.  You know kind of nervous about doing that though you know what I'm saying, but I got something that I gotta do.  To get definitive information on you know what, what were the circumstances in the, the method of my actual adoption.  Because being adopted I'm in--I was involved with, in a transaction that I had no say in.
Story_ID: 521095
Speaker 1: And the State of New York does not really allow those records to be accessed by the adopted--the adoptee, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Yeah, yeah a lot of I think there's only nine or ten states that allow open access to the adoptive--adoptees to their, their original birth certificates and all the details in their adoption.  They say they do, they say they do that to protect the birth mothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's disregarding my civil rights as a human being you know what I'm saying.  It's almost like saying, "Because we don't like the way you was conceived and born we don't like that so this is how it's gotta go."  You know everybody, the governor, the president, the people at the hall of records, they can go look at my--not the birth certificate they created when I was adopted, my original birth certificate which is my information about my life, who I am, who's my mother  and father this and that.  Because they didn't like that my mother [Berncenia Lovelace] was a single mother, unwed, that's like, that's like a civil rights violation, that's like discrimination.  Because you, because you're that, this is how it's gonna go.  How you gonna define you know what I'm saying my legal rights.  So that's a whole another fight that me and fellow adoptees are taking up.  We want all the birth records open.  We understand there should be protocol for me to approach my birth mother or my birth father because nine times out of ten that birth mother didn't even tell her husband her secret.  You know what I'm saying--
Story_ID: 521096
Speaker 1: My birth mother [Berncenia Lovelace] revealed to my sister that she had a kid out there but she never told the rest of the siblings.  So when I found out she had to go: "Sit down y'all, I've got something to tell you."  You know what I'm saying?  My bro- my sister she didn't get into detail with it, my sister said that my birth mother and my sister was watching a TV show one day about a lady that had a kid and my sister jokingly turned to my birth mother and said, "You don't have no secrets I should know about right?"  My birth mother said, "Yeah I do.  I do have--there's a, there's a kid out there," but they didn't get into it.  So then when I found her, she had to get into details with the siblings and they basically said, "Look, whatever you do if you gonna meet this nutcase, you make sure you do it at a Starbucks in the public because there's a lot of psychos out there," you know what I'm saying but when I, when I showed up they found out that it was true.  So there's still a lot that I don't know about my adoption.  The beautiful thing about it is my mother and father who raised me are the best mother and father ever.  That's why I rhymed about them on all my records.  You know what I'm saying.  On all my records, I always talk about my family.
Speaker 2: I think your mother; your adopted mother appears with you on a Christmas video (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yea, in the Christmas and holiday video that is my adoptive mother chasing around a little elf that is trying to ruin everything for Christmas.  And that was my mother's gift.  She--whether it's Thanksgiving, Christmas, 4th of July, your birthday, whenever there was a holiday, whenever there was something to celebrate, everybody would come over to Darryl [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels], Bannah McDaniels [Bannah Griffin McDaniels], Byford [Byford McDaniels] and Bannah McDaniels' house for my mother's Chris- macaroni and cheese and fried chicken.
Story_ID: 521097
Speaker 1: You make some good points about adoption.  We're gonna revisit this when it actually comes up in the chronology--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --later and talk about your, your siblings and other--.  But tell us about your adoptive parents.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who were they?  Where were they from and what do they--?
Speaker 2: Byford [Byford McDaniels] and Bannah McDaniels [Bannah Griffin McDaniels].  My father was from Jacksonville, Florida.  My mother was from Olar, South Carolina.  My father came up from Florida when he was sixteen years old to work, to get a job.  He was in the [U.S.] Army during the Korean War.  My mother came up when she was also sixteen and her and her siblings left South Carolina.  "We gonna go to New York [New York] and start a life."  She came up here, they met when--I think my mother and father was in their twenties when they met and--
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind that?
Speaker 2: I don't know that story how they met.  All I remember is my mother, she was a nurse.  I remember my mother, I remember my mother the earliest I can remember when I was in probably like right before kindergarten is where my memory can go back to.  I remember my mother she went to beauty school to learn to do hair.  So she first started making her money doing hair in the neighborhood and then she went to nursing school and she got her you know certification.  She was a registered nurse all of her whole life and all I remember is this, my mother and father always worked.  Liked they always worked.  And they sent me to Catholic school.  I actually remember--I, I remember going to I went to St. Pascal Baylon [St. Pascal Baylon School, Queens, New York] and I remember going to, to the house where the priest and the nuns stayed in rectory or whatever when I was really like probably right before kindergarten.  And I just remembered being in the rectory and they was over there talking whatever, whatever, whatever and I remember going to St. Pascal Baylon and I knew it was a Catholic school.  And I knew my mother and father was paying money for me to go to school but my parents always worked.  But we as you know I wasn't--Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] says I was spoiled.  I don't think I was spoiled because I didn't get stuff every day but they provided really, really well for me and my brother Alford [Alford McDaniels] who was their biological son.
Story_ID: 521098
Speaker 1: So you start off life in Harlem [New York, New York], right, and then (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I didn't know that 'til later.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: My life started from this is bef- let's forget about the adoption revelation.  When I was young enough my mother and father [McDaniels' adoptive parents, Bannah Griffin McDaniels and Byford McDaniels] before we moved to Hollis [Queens, New York], we lived in Brooklyn [New York] and on Kosciuszko Street and before we move--but I was one years old when we moved to Queens [New York].  My mother and father lived in Brooklyn and, and they moved to Queens when I was one and they bought they own house.  I think they said they paid forty thousand dollars for their first house and that's the house that I grew up in.  But Brooklyn, Queens so my whole life as you, people hear on my records, everything was from Queens.  You know saying I thought everything about my existence started in Queens until it was revealed that I was adopted and I was born in Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] that changed everything.
Speaker 1: I know, one thing I know about New York [New York] is that Queens is a place where you can have a yard and a little house.
Speaker 2: Yea.  Queens was different from Harlem and the Bronx [New York] and Brooklyn the projects.  Queens you had these single family homes.  You had a backyard, you had grass, you had lawn, you had a garage in the back.  We had projects where they weren't--in the area where I lived in Hollis, Queens, there was no projects like in 40 Projects [South Jamaica Houses, Queens, New York] in south side and, and Rego Park [Queens, New York] and the other projects, ours were homes with backyards, streets.  We had block associations, parks.  It was a low and middle class area, hardworking parents.  Some single family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your father worked for the Metropolitan Transit Authority [sic. Metropolitan Transportation Authority]?
Speaker 2: Yea, my father was a boi- he, he didn't drive the bus, he worked at the bus depots and he worked in the boiler room at the bus depots.  His, his whole career, his whole life was there.
Speaker 1: So this is a decent job for a working man right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was a really good decent job.  He put in a lot of time there, he was well respected and it provided a good you know it provided him with enough income to have a, you know, a mediocre life.  I remember he was able to buy an Electra 225 [Buick Electra] which is kind of like a poor man's Cadillac.
Speaker 1: Deuce and a Quarter.
Speaker 2: The Deuce and a Quarter.  He had one of those with his 8 track and everything.  He had work his way to get that though.  We started, I remember, we had a Falcon [Ford Falcon], then we had a Plymouth Valiant and then we had, then he had, then he, then got his Electra Deuce and a Quarter.  So I mean from--when I was little, I was always into school.  Like I was--it was just something about anything that was artistic or creative for me.  So I you know as a kid, I was really, really different from my brother [McDaniels' adoptive brother, Alford McDaniels].
Story_ID: 521099
Speaker 1: How many of 'em, of you were in the household, your mother, father (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's four of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's my mother, father [McDaniels' adoptive parents, Bannah Griffin McDaniels and Byford McDaniels], me and my brother Alford [McDaniels' adoptive brother, Alford McDaniels], who's their biological son.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Alford was--see I was always a good student.  I was always smart.  I was always reading and since kindergarten I was always into comic books and drawing stick figures you know G.I. Joes, army men but for me my whole existence was imagination.  I would spend 'til the time I work up 'til the time I was sleeping was either reading comic books, drawing I mean even before I was able to draw, I draw with stick figures.  But I used to play with my G.I. Joes and my Big Jims and my, my army men.  I wouldn't just play; I would do stories so tell us come down here and eat.  I go eat and I go back and play.  But I loved school.  Like I was one of those kids from the earliest age, I hated the summer vacation.  There was something about new pens and new notebooks that first day of school.  You know even, even the fact that I could read this book and receive this information or when you open up a blank notebook you could feel it.  I just loved reading and writing so you know I was, I was a kid.  I was--I didn't pay attention to what I just knew my mother and father was the best mother and father ever you know.  They weren't--they were strict but they wasn't overbearing you know what I'm saying.  They disciplined me well enough in a way that gave me power, knowledge and understanding and self-discipline.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the age gap between you and your brother?
Speaker 2: My brother is three years older than me, Alford.  He, he was a Trekkie.  He's into 'Star Trek,' 'Space: 1999,' 'Lost in Space,' but 'Star Trek' was his thing.  He was into comic books, but he, he couldn't draw as well as me.  He was into them though 'cause he started me.  As a matter of fact I bought my first comic book when I was in I think kindergarten and it was because my brother brought home these comic books.  And I remember when I got permission to walk to the store with him; my first comic book was Batman.  So but my brother wasn't as a good student as me.
Story_ID: 521100
Speaker 1: So was your favorite subjects in school the art related subjects?  Music (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No my favorite subjects in school was writing.  I think it was like English, social studies.  I mean I was good in math just because I had to be good in math, but everything else, science, I aced.  Like just to read something and the write about it you know what I'm saying.  You know write an essay it was writing.  It was writing.  It was just something about information that was incredible.  'Cause look I'm into comic books so this real information was in my comic books 'cause I think what made me a good student now that I look back on it and you know coming into the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s] all, every--now when I think about it I remember being a kid hearing TV shows and psychologists and doctors and educators say comic books ain't good, don't let the kids read comic books.  I, I remember that.  I was like why it's the best thing ever.  But because I was reading comic books, because I was reading everyday it made school that much easier but also deeper than that, in school you learn about World War II [WWII] but Captain America took me there.  When I'm reading Captain Amer- Red Skull took me there like I'm, I'm really there.  My--you, you--I'm in World War II.  In school you learn about the planets, it's the earth, moon, sun and stars and the rings around Saturn.  Silver Surfer took me there you know what I'm saying and that's now when I speak to kids I said if anybody ever tells you, you into that corny make believe stuff, you jump up on your desk in the middle of the class and you beat your chest like King Kong and says you goddamn right I'm into this make believe stuff because think about that word; make believe, make believe, make believe, make them believe.  Make--it becomes real.  But I had no idea what those comic books along with that education was setting me up to be.
Story_ID: 521101
Speaker 1: It was just--and my whole world--.  Because you know what I think comic books was important to me, I went to Catholic school.  I was a nerdy little kid.  I used to wear my glasses every day until I made my record talking about I wear glasses so I can see.  Growing up in the '70s [1970s] you was four eyes.  Glasses wasn't cool until the Gazelles and all of that when I rapped that I wear glasses then everybody people tell me to this day, "D [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] until you came along and rapped about glasses me wearing glasses wasn't cool 'til you put that globally," but as a kid my whole life was, "Hey four eyes."  Hit me upside the head.  "Did you see that?"  I went to Catholic school so being a Catholic school kid; I had to walk to school because St. Pascal Baylon [St. Pascal Baylon School, Queens, New York] was about seven blocks from my house maybe a fifteen minute walk to school.
Speaker 2: What's the name of the school again?
Speaker 1: St. Pascal Baylon elementary school on 199th Avenue between--199th Street between 112th [Avenue] and 113th Avenue but because I wore a uniform when the public, when the public school kids would see me I was a mark.  "Your parents--," and the kids are funny.  "Your parents are rich.  They pay for you to go to school.  Run it."  So I got my money taken.  I got teased because I went to Catholic school.  I got teased because I wore glasses so comic books was the universe where everything was perfect and safe for me.  When I was in my house, it was the best thing.  When I was at school it was the best thing.  The thing that was traumatic and horrifying to me was the walk from home to get to school and the walk back.  That's why I hated when the bell rung at two o'clock.  I was eager to get home but I had to walk through the hood to-- you know what I'm saying I gotta see those kids.
Story_ID: 521102
Speaker 1: In the book ['Ten Ways Not to Commit Suicide: A Memoir,' Darryl McDaniels] you talk a little about the demographics of where you grew up.  Now, your neighborhood was a mostly black neighborhood right?
Speaker 2: It was a mostly black neighborhood.  We had--growing up I remember there was Mr. Hooper [ph.] which was a white guy who lived on my corner and then there's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sounds like Sesame Street--
Speaker 2: There's a Mr. Hooper and then there was on Jam Master Jay block even later on throughout our career there was Danny White Boy and his family.  He literally, Danny White Boy and his mother, father and his sister Laurie [ph.] he was literally the last white people I'm talking about in our neighborhood of Hollis [Queens, New York].  But see my end of Hollis was a little more peaceful.  My end, my end of Hollis had nicer houses, nicer lawns.  It was different.  I lived on 197th Street.  The crazy part of Hollis was 200th Street up to 205th Street which we rapped about on 'My Adidas' records.  That's where all the pimps and the pushers and the drug dealers and the guns hung out on that upper where Jay was in the heart of it.  Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] was on the end of it, Hollis was basically 191st Street to 201 [201st Street]--well to Francis Lewis Boulevard but 205th Street which they renamed Run-D.M.C. Way [Run-DMC JMJ Way] that was Hollis.  The real heart of Hollis the hood part was where Jay lived at from 200 to 205th Street, Jay lived on 203rd [Street] so on the corner was the pizza shop where it all went down at.  My end of Hollis was a little quieter and peaceful and reserved you know what I'm saying.  Up on Hollis where you had to worry about the fights, the drug dealing, the shootings, stabbings, the stick up kids and all that on my end of Hollis we played tag and we played football and two hand touch and this and that and rode our bikes.  You wouldn't ride your bike up past 200th Street 'cause somebody might take your bike.  So it's this little, it was this one avenue of these couple of 191st to 205th Street to Francis Lewis but it was crazy.  It was like, it was like and people used to say it was like a little Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York] or it was like--Harlem [New York, New York] is beautiful now.  Harlem is Harlem now, it's been a renaissance.  But back in the day it was the Bronx [New York], there was Harlem, it was Brooklyn [New York], Bed-Stuy, Hollis was a little version of all of those but on my end it was way more peaceful.
Story_ID: 521103
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah we were just--
Speaker 2: Reminiscing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) talking off camera about the, about Queens [New York] and the tremendous Jamaican population in Queens and the homes of celebrities like James Brown and Louis--
Speaker 2: Yeah James Brown had a house there.  Louis Armstrong, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, so many influential people come from Queens believe it or not.  But you know at the time it was just like you know my world was only what was going on in my house, what was going on at school, what was going on on my block until I got old enough to leave the block.
Speaker 1: So is this like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's, the house he grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yeah Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] liked on 205th Street.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the next block over, 205th Place from--I never saw, I never saw him there personally but it was the house right on the corner and I think that was in his, his high school years when he was at Power Memorial [Power Memorial Academy, New York, New York] when he became (unclear) phenom (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is Power in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: No, Power is actually in, in Manhattan [New York].  Power--I didn't discover Power Memorial or any knowledge of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the ball player.  I went to Rice High School which was in Harlem [New York, New York].  Now here's the crazy thing.  I found out at thirty-five that I was born in Harlem.  I thought my whole life it was Hollis [Queens, New York] was all that I knew.  When I got a minute to write--I graduated from St. Pascal elementary [St. Pascal Baylon School, Queens, New York] and I went to Rice High School in Harlem, 124th Street and Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard] and my friends used to always ask me, "D [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] why in the hell do you take three trains and two buses to come to high school all the way over here?"  Jam Master Jay and Run went to school five minutes from Hollis.  They went to Andrew Jackson High School [Queens, New York] which was five minutes.  Everybody in Hollis would go to Andrew Jackson or they would go to Francis Lewis [Francis Lewis High School, Queens, New York] and the Bayside [Bayside High School, Bayside, New York] the high schools in Queens; Bayside, Cardozo [Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Bayside, New York], Andrew Jackson.  I went three buses, three trains--two buses to go all the way to Rice.  I was like I thought Rice was a good school.  It was an all-boys Catholic school, Congregation of Irish Christian Brothers [sic. Congregation of Christian Brothers].  It was, it was a really good school academically and they was known for basketball.  Dean Meminger went there, Felipe Lopez later on and stuff like that but they was known for basketball.  Their rivals was All Hallows [All Hallows High School, Bronx, New York], Power Memorial and Rice High School.  Those were the Catholic schools who battled in New York City [New York, New York].  Come to find out now that I look at my life, people ask me, "Why would you come to school all the way here," because I was born, Rice was on 124th Street.  Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] was on 129th Street.  I was drawn back to where I was born but had no idea.

Speaker 1: But the beautiful thing about going to Rice [Rice High School, New York, New York] was when I got to Rice, I really discovered hip hop.  And what I mean by that, prior to me going to Rice when 'Rapper's Delight' came out 'cause here I am, I'm this kid, I'm into comic books and school and it was like around 1976 where I started to notice that the deejays and the emcees, they wasn't rappers.  Rap isn't the thing they did.  They were deejays and emcees.  The deejays played a record and the master of ceremonies motivate and talked to the crowd.  It was 1976 when I started paying attention to oh these are guys, these--I didn't know what they were, they played music at the block party or they played music in the park or they played music at the backyard party or the house party but I'm still a kid didn't care nothing about it.  Once 'Rapper's Delight' came out, everybody wanted to be like the rapper guys on the records.  It wasn't a show biz thing it was the same way a little dreamed they was Dr. J [Julius Erving] or like me when I was a kid my thing that I wanted to be take my favorite blanket, a safety pin, put it on my neck and I'm Batman and Superman.  And I'm running through my house and my mother [McDaniels' adoptive mother, Bannah Griffin McDaniels] is going, "Boy, if you don't stop jumping in my house."  "But mommy you don't understand, I'm Batman."  "No you not in this house you ain't no Batman."  So that's what hip hop my first realization that's what it was, every--and I was still young.  It was my brother [McDaniels' adoptive brother, Alford McDaniels], I'm what eleven, twelve.  It was the kids fifteen and older that's wanted to buy deejay equipment.  So that was my first recollection of it so 'Rapper's Delight' came out and I heard 'Rapper's Delight' which was huge (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's Sugarhill?
Speaker 1: Sugarhill Gang's 'Rapper's Delight' came out changed everything.
Speaker 2: In 19--what's that?
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine [1979] okay.
Speaker 1: That record came out and changed everything.  So now in addition to loving your comic books, loving your kung fu movies, what else your skateboards, your bike, going to the park to play basketball you know have a crush on girls you know everything that was a young persons you know girls playing with their Barbie doll whatever, when 'Rapper's Delight' came out, changed everything.  Now we got this other added thing that everybody aspires to do and to experience.  So I still didn't pay attention to that.  I didn't start paying attention to it 'til a little bit later my brother--well this guy named Anthony Wallace [ph.] was the first dude to get his own turntables and two turntables of mixing records in his house.  So I still wasn't into it.  I would sit around and watch my brother you know the older kids do the deejay thing, then I would run off and go play.  And then this guy named Boobie [ph.] he got turntables something like so I guess my brother hung with Boobie and Anthony because they were the older kids than us.  So I guess my brother was like, "Yo, I need to get turntables too," but me and my brother we had a problem.  We didn't sell weed.  So we didn't have no money.  See the guys were selling weed had money, and they buy turntables, records everything immediately.  Good stuff, good speakers and stuff like that.  You got two options, you could save up your money and then go just--people used to just go buy the speakers and then we would build our own speaker cabinets and all that (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 521105
Speaker 1: I know I was thinking of this when I was reading about this so the opportunities for you to get employed in some other way I mean or your brother [McDaniels' adoptive brother, Alford McDaniels]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were kind of slim, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, there really wasn't no opportune--like it is now.  It was really no opportunities for young people to get employed on the huge level.  There was always those one or two dudes in the neighborhood [Hollis, Queens, New York] that would always get a job at the supermarket or at the fish market.  I remember Connie [ph.], a friend we used to call him fish man, that's what he was in the hood 'cause he, he ran the streets you know what I'm saying, he was a cool guy, always fly.  The reason why he was always fly because he had money but he would--he worked at the fish market.  So me and my brother we had a problem.  We were still getting allowance you know what I'm saying.  I think I was getting like maybe six dollars.  My brother was getting eight or ten whatever you know what I'm saying so we would have to save up to get a new pair of sneakers or save up to get comic books.  But over the years, remember I brought my first comic book in kindergarten.  Over the years me and my brother we accumulated this huge collection of comic books, the Marvel comic books was our favorite.  DC [DC Comics] was cool, Batman, Superman, Justice League, Flash, but Gotham and Metropolis was fictional.  Marvel, Stan Lee was amazing because he really had superheroes in New York City [New York, New York].  So as a little kid we opening up this world of fantasy but it's in New York City.  We're seeing Hell's Kitchen [New York, New York], we're seeing the Lower East Side [New York, New York].  We're seeing 5th Avenue and Times Square [New York, New York], the Statue of Liberty [New York, New York] and stuff like that so it was very attractive to us because comic, Marvel comic books showed young people in New York the world that they live in that we were too young to go see.
Speaker 1: That's right because the Fantastic Four lived in New York, Spiderman lived--
Speaker 2: Yea, Avengers Mansion was in New York.  So we're seeing New York and Spiderman was from Queens [New York].  I'm from Queens, whatever, whatever.  So me and my brother we had this huge comic book collection so I remember the day my brother comes in my room and he goes, "You know what we gonna do to get money?"  Something in his eyes just said no, no don't say it, don't say it.  "We're gonna do a comic book sale."  So we called a comic book sale.  We made enough money to get two--we wasn't able to get the Technics and the Pioneer and the, and the--we got two plastic BSR [Birmingham Sound Reproducers] turntables and the forty dollar little Gemini up and down mix, it didn't even have a cross fade.  But we, we did a comic book sale and we brought--we was, we was able to get two turntables and a mix and some records.
Story_ID: 521106
Speaker 1: Now okay now tell me like what you know 'cause some people like me don't know as much about this.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What does it mean to have two turntables?  What can you do with two turntables?
Speaker 2: With two turntables you can take two of the same records, play those two records and keep whatever favorite part of the record that you like going over and over and over again.  It's called mixing.  For example, the record 'Good Times' by Chic was a big deejay record.  Good to the break part, you know the record comes on its singing (singing) "Happy days are here again, time marches on and let's go and (unclear) roller skate" so the records playing that part of the record's playing.  Halfway when it gets most records when it gets to the middle of the record, there's a break where the band just plays music so this particular record, their break was "Ding, ling, ling, ling good times bum, du bum, bum be bum bum, bum, bum, bum" and now it would end and the music would go back to the singing and the record goes off.  That's how deejaying was in the beginning but because of this mixer thing you can now go, "Good times, bum, bum, ba bum, bum be bum, bum good times, bum, bum" you could keep the good times part going over and over and over.  So you was able to loop and keep the break beat going which was the best part of the record which makes the party even better now.
Speaker 1: This is the song that 'Rapper's Delight' is actually built on top of right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's funny that you say.  'Rapper's Delight' was the sample of 'Good Times.'
Story_ID: 521107
Speaker 1: So my brother [McDaniels' adoptive brother, Alford McDaniels], we get the two turntables and the mixer.  'Rapper's Delight' one of the first records that we was able to buy was already on the radio, everybody was bugging out like what is this.  You know, everybody who heard 'Rapper's Delight' had to learn it from start to end, it's just a rite of passage.  Just had to learn that record from start to end.  But then after that I didn't start paying attention so now here's the funny thing me and my brother we do a comic book sale and sell our comic books to get our turntable and our mixer and some records so he's a little older than me.  The rule was, "Yo when I ain't in the house you can't touch my turntables."  So I'm look but that's big brother's stuff.  Okay.  But him, Boobie [ph.] and Anthony [Anthony Wallace (ph.)] would leave and go to their house and deejay that's what gave me time to run down there and do the deejay thing.  But I just still didn't care about it.  I was not into it.  I wasn't into it 'til my brother one day came home with 'cause 'Rapper's Delight' had the light blue Sugarhill [Sugarhill Gang] logo on it.  The only records didn't have album covers, it was no videos, it was just a label of the record, you had to read to see what it was.  One day my brother brings home this giant 33 inch that we called them giant 45s [45 rpm record] and it was a red label with the words in black letters Enjoy Records and it said Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five 'Superrappin'.'  And he came and he played it.  When I first heard it I was like this is crazy, this is crazy.  I remember when he put the needle on the record because 'Rapper's Delight' was, hip hop, the hippid, the hippid, the hippidy hip, over 'Good Times' and it was just one guy rapping another guy rapping, another guy rapping forever and the record was like eleven to twelve minutes long.  By the end of the record you kind of got tired of listening to 'Rapper's Delight' but this particular day when my partner put this record, this needle, put the needle, put the record on the turntable, put the needle on the record, it did this.  It came on like this.  "It was a party night everybody was breaking, the house was screaming and the base was shaking and it won't be long 'til everybody know that the Flash is on the beat box going and dun, dun," and the music was playing du, du, du and du pu bum and then it said, "Shaw nah nah."  And then all of a sudden you hear these voices, "Italian, Caucasian, Japanese, Spanish, Indian, Negro, Vietnamese, emcee disc jockeys y'all. Fly kiss for the young ladies," and then this base line came in, "Dun, dun do du, dun, de dun," and it went like this, "Introducing the crew you gotta see to believe," five different voices where one, two, three, four, five emcees and one said, "I'm Melle Mel and I rock it so well," and the next guy said, "and I'm Mr. Ness and I rocks the best," and third guy said, "Rahiem and all the ladies scream," and some other dude says, "Cowboy [Keith Cowboy] and I make you jump for joy," and this guy said, "Creole" and then all of them yell, "Solid gold, The Kidd Creole play the role dig this we're the Furious Five plus Grandmaster Flash giving you a blast that sho nuff last so to prove to you all that was second to none, we're gonna make five emcees sound like one.  You gotta dip the--," oh my god over and over I didn't leave the basement.  There was just something about the delivery and what's this?  "No Mom [McDaniels' adoptive mother, Bannah Griffin McDaniels] I can't come eat right now."  And it was that record that made me pay attention so now when I'm going to the block parties now that record is playing and now in addition to 'Rapper's Delight' you got all these other records.  You got the Furious Five and then it's this group called the Treacherous Three and it's like what is--so now I'm paying attention.  I'm a ride my bike into the park and sit there and just listen to the record.  'Cause it wasn't like, it wasn't like, it was the delivery, the sound, the music, the words, the different voices.  It wasn't that I needed to, to do this or it was me.  What they were doing vocally and musically it was just, it was me oh wow.  Still didn't understand it so because of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, what had happened is that I started writing rhymes because I realized that 'Rapper's Delight,' people don't realize that when I was younger there was two types of hip hop.  I didn't notice though but there was two types of hip hop.  There was a hip hop that was already in the clubs.  There was a group of older deejays, DJ Hollywood, Eddie Cheeba, Pete DJ Jones.  There was hip hop--
Story_ID: 521108
Speaker 1: Let me start here.  Before hip hop it was disco.  You all know how huge disco was.  I mean even The Stones [The Rolling Stones] did 'Miss You.'  David Bowie, The Trammps, the black R&B groups started making the, "Burn baby burn, disco inferno" ['Disco Inferno'].  That music dum, dum, dum.  It was a different energy then what rock and folk and even soul music was doing.  Disco was huge.  But remember disco was dying.  Disco go so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventies [1970s] it was--
Speaker 1: They came up with the saying disco sucks.  You know but before people started hating disco, it was amazing.  I was--I did not care.  My brother [McDaniels' adoptive brother, Alford McDaniels] was into the records, not into disco per se but disco we didn't know in disco 'cause we kids, the disco thing had a deejay.  The deejay would play all these records and people would go to Studio 54 [New York, New York] and dance and party and you know what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: 'Good Times' was a disco song.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  'Good Times' was a disco song.  So, we knew, we were too young to get into Studio 54.  Even back then the perception of New York City [New York, New York] at the time was New York City must be heaven because remember L.A. [Los Angeles, California], CEOs, opulent, important athletes, actresses, everybody was coming from Hollywood to come party at Studio 54.  It was sex, it was money, it was diamonds, it was champagne, it was Rolls Royces, it was fur coats.  So when people would see the little blurbs on TV they thought New York was heaven.
Speaker 2: Yeah you couldn't even get in there unless you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We were kids.  Right even if you a grown man you ain't getting in there unless you got some clientele or some juice or you had to be a, you had to be known.  You had to be somebody on this earth.  So in the disco it was the same mentality of when hip hop would later become.  We kind of took our, we created our own discos in the streets at the block parties and the (unclear).  Hip hop basically was we're gonna play this music for these two or three hours until the police come and tell us go home because you cannot--you gotta have a permit to have a concert in a public space.  We was busting a light pole open, putting up these big speakers and doing our music but so we was doing--to relieve ourselves from poverty and our death and despair and destruction and just the life in the streets of these big inner cities playing our block parties and playing our block parties was the release for these kids.  When the music went off and when the cops came and told us to, "Turn these speakers off, y'all take your asses home," we go back into our life whether it's drug dealing, poverty, one family, mother's on cra- like that life.  This hip hop was our release.  Hip hop was our Studio 54.
Story_ID: 521109
Speaker 1: What I was gonna say was when me and my brother [McDaniels' adoptive brother, Alford McDaniels] we got our turntables, my brother would leave and go, I would go in the basement.  Before I heard 'Superrappin',' I heard a cassette tape of a live performance of Grandmaster Flash so I knew Flash was a deejay but I was still too little to put it together.  Then when I heard the Furious Five record, I knew, I started paying attention.  The 'Rapper's Delight' guys [Sugarhill Gang] is rapping over this music telling their stories then I heard the way the Furious Five did it I just started writing rhymes so I could have rhymes for a deejay, wasn't to be that and that was '78 [1978] that was eighth grade [at St. Pascal Baylon School, Queens, New York].  I was the class of '82 [1982] so '79 [1979], '80 [1980], '81 [1981], '82 [1982].  And '79 [1979] was my freshman year at Rice High School [New York, New York] so what I'm trying to say is we had these records out, we had these rap records--these, these, it wasn't even hip hop. See I'm--hip hop before it was labeled.  We had records like 'Rapper's Delight' and 'Superrappin'' but it wasn't rap songs 'cause it was deejays and emcees so we had these records out where we were using a lot of disco records 'cause disco records always had the great beat the deejay could keep going but when I got to Rice High School in Harlem [New York, New York] which was right over from the Bronx [New York] but see I didn't know all this, when I got to Rice High School in ninth grade, I heard a form of this rapping emcee stuff that I didn't know exist.  What I mean is when I got to Rice High School, I started hearing one of the guys who wrote 'Rapper's Delight' and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five before they was allowed to even go record in recording studios.  I heard what they were doing at their block parties and their park parties and what I was gonna say was there was a hip hop that was already in the club.  That's why a lot of the records, a lot of the rappers wanted to sound like your favorite jock.  "I'm the disco deejay rapping man you know I say clap your hands and stomp your feet," those were older dudes.  Those dudes were basically twenty-one and older.  Maybe nineteen and older and they could get in a club they could (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Donnie Simpson style voice--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Imhotep Gary Byrd.
Speaker 1: Gary Byrd yes.  Exactly.  Gary Byrd and what was the guy Hank Strand [sic. Hank Spann] and what the guy on WBLS [WBLS Radio, New York, New York]?  Oh my goodness.  So those guys were doing the hip hop deejay thing in that mode.  They was already in the club so remember I was too young to get in the club.  When I got to Rice High School to make you understand better, I started hearing Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five before they even thought about recording records.  I started hearing the Treacherous Three.  The Funky Four Plus One.  The Plus One was this female girl [Sha Rock] it was four dudes and this female girl that was rapping but the beautiful thing about me hearing hip, hearing these emcees who were rapping before they made records, they were talking about stuff that I could relate as a young dude.  They were talking about going to school.  They were talking about going to eat at McDonald's.  They were talking about going to the movies.  They were talking about watching Bugs Bunny.  It was the younger demographic doing--emulating the hip hop, there was a younger demographic emulating the radio deejay club style deejay performance thing but they were talking about what they did and that changed my perception of writing.  Then I realized I can write about what Darryl [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] does.  So that kind of--I had no idea where this was going but that started me okay I became Easy D.  It was easy for me to write because I'm a good student and my name is Darryl begins with a D so originally my, my, my rap name was Easy D and I used to just write all these rhymes about what Darryl liked to do, going to the store, playing with my G.I. Joes, playing with my army men, listening to the radio, riding my skateboard, riding my bike.  What I like to eat.  So that all was what I was writing not even thinking of being them just you supposed to do this it's like playing with my G.I. Joe.
Speaker 2: So basically you just you know performed these raps for yourself or did you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah it was me believing--the same way I used to pretend to be Batman and Superman, it was me pretending to be Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five that's all (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 521110
Speaker 1: Let me ask you like now I remember in the book ['Ten Ways Not to Commit Suicide: A Memoir,' Darryl McDaniels] you said that when you sold your comic book collection--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is when you really became tight with Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run], with--
Speaker 2: Well, no, no, no.  When me and my bro- that's funny, it's good you're bringing it up.  When me and my brother [McDaniels' adoptive brother, Alford McDaniels] did the comic book sale, the doorbell rings one day and it was Joseph Simmons who went to St. Pascal Baylon [St. Pascal Baylon School, Queens, New York].  We didn't hang together, he wasn't my friend.  He was always in the other class.  Run was always in the other class.  My best friend growing up was a young man named Douglas Hayes.  That was my best friend.  I actually followed him to Rice [Rice High School, New York, New York] then I followed him to St. John's University [Queens, New York] but one day the doorbell rings and it was Joseph Simmons who heard that Darryl McDaniels [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] from the other class had comics for sale.  He came in, bought comic books and went home, it was that plain and simple.  But what had happened with Joseph Simmons was this, now me and my brother got turntables.  I'm writing rhymes but I'm still Darryl.  I'm still riding my bike, let's go play football.  I was hanging with this guy Doug.  Doug was a fat black kid from Hollis Avenue who played with the CYO [Catholic Youth Organization], Catholic youth basketball league.  They had this Catholic, Catholic sports league in all of these inner cities and Doug, Douglas Hayes was in the senior group.  Mark Jackson, New York Knicks phenom, rookie of the year at St. John's University, Mark Jackson was on the intermediate level.  People used to always go to the CY to Catholic youth basketball league games to see two people.  They would go to see Mark and they would go to see Douglas had a nickname Butter.  He was a fat black kid who had a crazy dribble and a crazy jump shot.  Mark Jackson would score forty a game.  Wow look at this kids gonna go somewhere and he did.  You see what Mark did.  Butter would score fifty but Butter didn't--ain't have no NBA [National Basketball Association] aspirations.  It was just you would go to these games to see Mark Jackson you would go to see Butter.  You know see Butter would always hit the last shot to win the game.  With that being said, and, and all right I gotta go back a little bit more.  When we was at St. Pascal Baylon in eighth grade before I got to ninth grade, we had one basketball hoop in the schoolyard and I remember in seventh grade, this tall guy in seventh grade he was like seven feet tall to us but we kids.  He wasn't seven feet, he probably was probably was maybe 5'11" because this is elementary school so to us he was seven feet tall.  This kid named David McEachum [ph.] came to school in seventh grade and then in the eighth grade after school would end we'd get out of school like 2:10 and one day after school David McEachum dunked on a rim and broke the rim, pulled the rim off the backboard.  So now we got no place to play basketball.  My mother and father [McDaniels' adoptive parents, Bannah Griffin McDaniels and Byford McDaniels] who I said was a hardworking family, always worked providing me with stuff, they put a basketball rim in the backyard.  So what we would start to do is after school all the kids would come to my house right after school and we'd play basketball in my backyard and they would go home.
Story_ID: 521111
Speaker 1: One particular day in ninth grade, no in eighth grade, Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] came over to my house and played basketball and I let him in my house to get water and when I was little the rule was when no adults is home what's rule?  You don't have company when no parents was in the house.  But it was only one, one particular day, Run just came over by, Joseph Simmons, came over by himself to play basketball and I was like my mother [McDaniels' adoptive mother, Bannah Griffin McDaniels]--we got out of school 2:10, we usually play basketball from 2:30 to 3:30 and my mother would get home at 4:00.  So this particular day I was like it's 3:30, "My mother won't be home 'til 4:00, come in the house and get water."  So this particular day when he came in the house to get water, he saw the comic books, he saw my brother's [McDaniels' adoptive brother, Alford McDaniels] turntables, whatever and he was like, "No you do that turntable stuff?"  I was like no.  I said no.  'Cause I did but I didn't, he ain't supposed to know that, that's my make believe time with me pretending.  He was like, "Yeah my brother--," you ever see [HistoryMaker] Russell Simmons, Run's brother before rap records was made was a party promoter.  He would go higher Grandmaster Flash and Eddie Cheeba and DJ Hollywood, he would go rent a hall you know he would go rent a PAL [Police Athletic League] room or he would go rent the, the foreign legion [ph.] room.  He would go rent a room you know of gym and he would hire Flash and them to play and would promote parties and make people pay to come see what we could already see for free in the park but we had to see this so we didn't have no beef playing two or three dollars or five dollars to see that.  But make a long story short, me and Run developed this habit we gonna play basketball then we gonna go in the basement and deejay before my mother and father [McDaniels' adoptive father, Byford McDaniels] came home.  But when I got in the ninth grade [at Rice High School, New York, New York], we still kept the routine up even though him and Jay [Jam Master Jay] went to a different school, he got out earlier than me because I took three buses and trains to get home so he would always be out of school waiting for me when I would get home from school, we would go in the basement and do that.  So now he's starting to come in my basement and he's seeing my school books where I'm writing all my rhymes at and he just picks up my books one day and he's like, "Darryl [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels], you wrote this?"  I was like yeah.  He was I don't remember the day he said it, it was like he was speaking a foreign language, but he goes, "When Russell lets me make a record," 'cause remember records are being now, "I'm gonna put you in my group."  And I'm looking at him like what did he just say to me?  Like went in one year and out the other.  So Run saw that I had some good lyrics like he saw this guy really has a gift for that and the reason why Run saw it from the perspective remember even before 'Rapper's Delight' came out, Run was a little kid, his brother was doing business, he was hiring deejays and throwing parties.  So Run saw the business of hip hop from hands on.  Kurtis Blow, DJ Hollywood, all these guys was in and out his house in Hollis [Queens, New York] because the guys would come to Russell to get their money and all that.  So Run saw the business, I only saw the creative side of it.  So that's when the seed was planted in me.

Speaker 1: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now I was told like just this week I was checking with some friends of mine on the history of hip hop--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --trying to get a history and they were telling me about a guy named Kool Herc [DJ Kool Herc] and a long time ago I met a fellow named Kool Keith I think.
Speaker 1: Oh Kool Keith.
Speaker 2: Yeah Kool Keith.
Speaker 1: From Ultramagnetic MCs.
Speaker 2: Yeah Ultramagnetic MCs.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And I talked to a fellow named Paradise.

Speaker 2: Yeah Paradise Gray.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was there at the beginning of all this.
Speaker 2: Yeah he had the Latin Quarter club [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Yea, where all the early hip hop was.  Kool Herc was the first guy to be known in New York [New York] as the deejay that was doing the parks and the block parties.  He was, he was, he was the most famous out of them you know what I'm saying, he had a name.  Kool Herc and the Herculoids which was his crew and his sound system.
Story_ID: 521113
Speaker 1: The early hip hop was based on who had a louder sound.  A battle wasn't a deejay battle or emcee battle until those techniques got more developed.  The original deejay battle in a park or in, at a block party was between crews to see who had the loudest sound system.  So it would be for example it would be Kool Herc [DJ Kool Herc] and it would Afrika Bambaataa and Zulu Nation [Universal Zulu Nation] and it would be Grandmaster Caz and his boy Wiz [DJ Disco Wiz] and they would all set up in the park and they would, you go first.  Play your sound.  Throw on a beat jam nobody had you know there was things that you can do throw on a record that nobody had last week.  So you got to a beat that my crew don't got, you know what I'm saying, but I could still win with you if I played a record that you know I already got and my system's louder than yours.  And then the other guy would go that's how the battles went.  As the deejaying got more ticks Grandmaster Flash developed a quick mix, "Good times, good times, good times."  Grand Wizard Theodore from the Fantastic Five sees they're scratching.  Theodore was the first to go vicky, vicky, vicky which oh my god it was all a mistake.  He said he was in his bedroom I believe in the projects in his bedroom and his mother was like, "Theodore," and he, "Huh?"  And when he went huh the record so he was scrib- .  He played the music it was wicked and his mother was calling, "Ma you gotta wait a minute."  You know what I'm saying that's how it came so the deejay battles became who got the better quick mix, who got the better techniques.  But the whole idea was who got first it was the loud sound system but then it became who can do better on the turntables and who emcee had better rhymes than other emcees and that was the whole competitive aspect of it.  And everybody just wanted to do that.
Speaker 2: So a good deejay can play a turntable like you play an instrument?
Speaker 1: Turntables became instruments.  That's why now the real deejays don't just use the, the CDJs and the digital things.  The real deejays must touch records, the wax.  Real deejays are experienced with wax.  You're not a real deejay if you ain't touch wax.  You're just a guy playing records.
Story_ID: 521114
Speaker 1: Let me ask this.  'Cause I've often thought--I know in my hometown a lot of funk musicians came out--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and some people wonder like why.  But I--there was a good music education system in place people learned how to play instruments, you could take 'em home for a dollar when I was growing up--
Speaker 2: That's crazy.
Speaker 1: --and how to play.  I mean everybody taught--I can read music and I'm not really a musician--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but everybody could ready music.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What happened in the hip hop era--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --when you see the decline of musicianship.  There's nobody playing music.  Is it because the schools pull back the instruments, or what happened?
Speaker 2: I mean that's part of it.  That's a big part of it.  I mean Jam Master Jay said he, he, he wanted to go to school because if he didn't get good grades he couldn't be in the band you know what I'm saying.  There was an aspiration--I mean on the other level too think about all those young people and the world they lived in.  There was something empowering, something that was a release by playing their music.  Like I said we, we'd do our block parties and the deejay would play those music for those two or three hours it was the most beautiful-est time.  Imagine if you could make the music you know what I'm saying.  There was a time when it was cool to take guitar lessons and piano lessons and drum lessons and, and horn lessons and violin lessons because then you can get with your friends who all are taking lessons and make the music that was inspiring and empowering you.  But on the other hand I think with hip hop what happened with--what made the musician obsolete was technology.  I don't need the band now.  I don't need to waste time and say yo get a drum, get a guitar player here because now right when disco was dying and hip hop started blowing up, everything was about the beats so they start making drum machines.  That spoiled it right there for the drummers.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  And then after that they started making--remember the keyboard was part of the band.  Now they making the keyboard where you can have all the band sounds in the keyboard.  That's what messed it up for the musicians, the, you know, the musicians.
Speaker 1: I suppose it's like an instant gratification (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah technology.  So it took away from the art of it.  Now you can just sit there and make the music.  That had a big part to do with it but also what had to do with it was the phenomenon, the phenomenal presentation of hip hop.  Run-DMC we used to open for Con Funk Shun and The Gap Band and The Bar-Kays.  When we used to do the show we, we had probably twenty minutes at the show so we would come out--imagine these people from the '60s [1960s] to the '70s [1970s] were used to come seeing bands play whether it was James Brown, Parliament-Funkadelic, Marvin Gaye, Gap Band, Con Funk Shun whatever.  Now this new thing is buzzing you know this is when Run-DMC is making, one of these rappers is making records but when the guy comes out and is doing something with the turntables, it's like what the y'all do you see.  And then some guys come out, "Throw your hands in the air, everybody when I say this you say," now before I used to watch the performance now you're a part of it.  So that changed drastically where all right you paid to see The Bar-Kays but you want--, "Yo could you bring the thing."  You didn't even know what to go--can you bring those dudes that came out and did the thing with the turntables again 'cause not only are you experiencing something, it's visual, it's audio but they're making you part of the thing you're not just a spectator now; you're a part of it.  So it was technology and it was just a presentation of what hip hop was doing.
Story_ID: 521115
Speaker 1: Meanwhile you're in high school, now did you--
Speaker 2: Well I'm in high school still when all this (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  You're in high school still and you all are developing this, your techniques and the (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no what had happened was I'm in high school. That's all I knew, I'm in high school and I got my rhymes.  So ninth grade is all school.  The beautiful thing about high school in ninth grade I think it was Brother Mike [ph.], my school was all-boys Catholic high school Congregation of Irish Christian Brothers [sic. Congregation of Christian Brothers] and Brother Mike he wanted to connect with the black and the Latino kids in the classroom.  So he would give us five minutes before English class he would give us five minutes probably a little longer but it was probably more like ten minutes, but he would give us five, ten, five to ten minutes to do anything creative.  You could do late work.  You could draw.  'Cause he didn't want you doodling.  He wanted your complete attention.  You can take out a comic book and read comic book, you could read a newspaper, you could read a magazine, you could just sit there and not do nothing.  But he would give us--I would always use my time to write new rhymes then.  So by the time when I go, by the time ninth grade was over, I had stacks and stacks of books, stacks and stacks of book.  So Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] he's coming over, he's seeing what I'm writing but he ain't saying nothing yet you know what I'm saying and we're, we're--he's coming over now, now we're going in the basement and I'm rhyming.  Before I used to deejay for him.  I actually taught Run to deejay but before I was just deejaying 'cause that's where I wanted to be.  He started discovering my rhymes, "Yo D [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] say something."  Now he knows that I can rhyme.  So to make a long story short I was just in school when I had my rhymes so twelfth grade comes my guidance counselor, Brother Felix [ph.], I believe his name was, comes in one day in twelfth grade and puts these long big papers in front of us.  And it says pick an occupation.  Pick what you wanna be when you graduate or when you grow up.  I'm like I'm a kid, I don't know that's the farthest thought I wanna finish school and I wanna go home and read my comic books, my escape (unclear) go in the basement and deejay whatever so he puts this in front of me.  It's like pick and here's a list of universities and colleges if you could go to one, what do you pick?  Here's what I did true story, you can put this there.  "I don't know what I wanna be.  Yo Butter [Douglas Hayes]," because me and Butter we went to the same elementary [St. Pascal Baylon School, Queens, New York] and I followed him to Rice High School [New York, New York].  "What I do?"  He says, "Hold up."  He says, "Pick business management."  "Okay.  Hold on."  He says, "Pick St. John's University [Queens, New York]," 'cause we didn't want--he, he didn't wanna leave state and go live on campus at Syracuse [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York] or USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].  St. John's was about a twenty minute bus ride from Hollis [Queens, New York].  So we was thinking we could go to St. John's University, do our class and come back home and be right back home in Hollis, cool.  So I do that, pick I think I picked St. John's University, City University [City University of New York, New York, New York] some schools that s-Baruch College [New York, New York] 'cause my Uncle Ronnie [ph.] went to Baruch.  So I was just picking stuff that I heard as a kid.
Story_ID: 521116
Speaker 1: Come to find out I get accepted to St. John's University [Queens, New York] so I wrote a rhyme about it.  "I'm DMC [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] in the place to be.  I'm going to St. John's--," ['Sucker M.C.'s'] just to rhyme--not for the record, I just wrote a rhyme about it, just wrote my rhyme.  So I graduate from Rice High School [New York, New York] whatever it was in August because we graduated in June.  August, the phone rings.  It's Joe [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run].  "Yo D remember four years ago I told you whenever Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Simmons] made me a record I'm a put you in my group?"  "Yeah."  "Grab your rhyme books, we're going to the studio, gonna make this record.  I want you to write about how the world is.  We're gonna make this record called 'It's Like That' and we're gonna talk about how the world is."  The reason why he chose 'It's Like That' that summer this record called 'The Message' by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five came out which was took to another level, it was social commentary.  It was, it was, it was a work of art on, on a Marvin Gaye, James Brown level.  It was Gil Scott-Herring [sic. Gil Scott-Heron].  It was better than anything in the news because remember prior to the message people thought New York [New York] was beautiful.  Studio 54 [New York, New York] and the money and the Giants [New York Giants] and the Knicks [New York Knicks] and Clyde Walt Frazier [sic. Walt Frazier] and they knew about 42nd Street but the perception was New York was everybody's doing well but this message, the record came out and told the truth and the beautiful thing about the message was by young folks.  It wasn't a politician.  It wasn't a leader in a community, it wasn't a pastor or a priest.  It was young dudes from the Bronx [New York] talking about no this is what life is really like.  So Run wanted to make that type of record so he says, "D write a record called 'It's Like That' and we're going to the studio."  So I grabbed--I write my rhymes, we go into the studio and we record 'It's Like That' and that's the way it is and 'Sucker M.C.'s' which was the first single that Run-DMC did as this group.  Now that being said, we did the record.  My only aspiration because at that time, hip hop was only on the radio Friday and Saturday night.  It's not like it is now you know what I'm saying.  It was only on Friday and Saturday night and you had to come with something brilliant, something musically, conceptually, lyrically and artistically awesome to get your record played.  Not like the crap records that are being played now.  Think about it hip hop is on radio twenty-four hours.  So they gotta fill and just throw on whatever to keep the people's attention.  That's why the music is so bad.  Before we--you had Friday and Saturday night so you had five days to study, work, conceive it was artistic.  You had to sit there to make a rap song to make it hip (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Yeah there were a couple of shows here in Chicago [Illinois] that you know on the weekend were rap, just for rap--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah and that was everywhere.  Even in the South, which was all rap but it wasn't twenty-four seven.  So we had to--we knew we had to come with a record that was saying something in order to have the record like 'Sucker M.C.' ['Sucker M.C.'s'] which was showing our skills.
Story_ID: 521117
Speaker 1: So originally I wasn't gonna be on 'Sucker M.C.'s.'  But let me, let me back up.  So Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] says, "Yo we going to the studio, I'll call you in a few days to let you know the details."  So I wrote my rhymes for 'It's Like That' and then I remember it was a Sunday, he came to get me at two p.m. on a Sunday.  "Yo we coming to get you right now in Larry's [Larry Smith] Cadillac," 'cause remember on the record, "Larry put me inside Cadillac, chauffeur drove off," you know Larry had this big two door sedan DeVille [Cadillac DeVille].  Remember how long and big the doors were long and heavy.  He had a light blue with a white vinyl top sedan DeVille.  I remember they pulled up to my house two p.m. on a Sunday.  I didn't even tell my mother [McDaniels' adoptive mother, Bannah Griffin McDaniels] where I was going.  I get in the car with them.  We drive to Manhattan [New York] to Greene St. Recording studios, and we go down in Greene St. Recording studios and we record 'It's Like That and That's the Way It Is' ['It's Like That'] and originally I was supposed just be on 'It's Like That.'  The 'Sucker M.C.'s' song was already one song by itself so Run and the whole, the whole studio session Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Simmons]--the only reason Russell let me on 'It's Like That' 'cause I wrote.  He said, "D [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] can write but D is not a performer.  He's not a rapper, he's not an emcee.  He's smart and he can write," and Run fought to get me in the group 'cause Run didn't wanna be in the group by himself.  That was Run's whole thing.  Basically Run did this.  Russell, 'cause Russell, "This is Darryl McDaniels from Hollis [Queens, New York], your friend from elementary school [St. Pascal Baylon School, Queens, New York], what the hell you got him for."  So Run was like, "He's really good I'm telling you.  I seen him rap."  Russell was like, "Whatever, whatever."  So Run basically did this, "Russell if you don't put D in the group I'm gonna hold my breath 'til I die."  Russell was like, "I don't care."  A couple minutes later, Run started to turn gray.  Russell's still, "I don't care."  "Oh Russell, he's starting to turn blue now."  "Okay, okay Run."  That was the only reason Russell let me rhyme--I was supposed to write the lyrics, Run was supposed to do the whole record. Run said, "Russell if you don't let D in the group I'm gonna kill myself."  So Russell saw that he was serious.  But then Run's record 'Sucker M.C.'s' Run had already wrote that was originally gonna be Run's record by himself.  Run knew I had all the good stuff.  He was like, "D I'm gonna do my three verses."  That's why I come on the end of 'Sucker M.C.'s' so short.  Run went and laid his three verses and say, "Go in there and put a rhyme on the record."  I was like, "No you gonna get me in trouble with your brother," because remember Russell didn't want me there.  He said, "I don't care what Russell say.  Go in there."  And I went there and I said, "What do you want me to do?"  He said, "Sing one of your new rhymes."  Remember when I graduate I wrote a rhyme about graduating so I got to the part "DMC if you ready, the people rocking steady driving big cars, get your gas from Getty."  I just said, "I'm DMC in the place to be.  I go to St. John's University [Queens, New York].  Since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge after twelfth grade I went straight to college."  Laid the whole rhyme.  When I came out the studio door, guess who the first person waiting there was for me, Russell.  All of a sudden I'm his good friend.  "Oh, my god, D I didn't know you that--," so for the rest of the sessions and sessions thereafter, my whole thing was Russell sitting by me arm around my shoulder like I'm his--he didn't care about Run no more and everybody who came in the studio, "Say the rhyme D."  "Say the--," he take me to meetings, "Say the rhyme D, say the rhyme."  Trying to sell us to get the record deal and then we finally got the record deal on Profile Records.  It's crazy, right?  So I was just doing it and, and in the beginning what I wanna add is hip hop in the beginning was safe for me.  What I mean by that was remember there was no video and no album covers so I can make these records with Run and not be known.
Speaker 2: You're anonymous.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's me on the radio, I wasn't, that's me, that's me.  It was superhero like to me.  I'm on the record but I'm standing here right next to them.  It was safer (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 521118
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was playing the record then when it--after you made it how soon was it heard by the people (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, you record the record, you press up the copies of the vinyl records and then you take 'em to all the hip hop, you take 'em to all the deejays in New York [New York] that was playing the records.  Mr. Magic, DJ Red Alert [Kool DJ Red Alert], Chuck Chillout [DJ Chuck Chillout], The Awesome Two [Special K and Teddy Tedd], DJ Marley Marl and The Supreme Team [The World's Famous Supreme Team] just to name a few.  You take your record, you can take it to the radio station, ring the bell and say yo, if they like it, they'll play it.  So the deejay started playing our records.  First it was just on the weekends but then they start to play our records like along with Flash [Grandmaster Flash], 'The Message,' 'Our Planet Rock' [sic. 'Planet Rock'], and 'Rapper's Delight.'  They started playing our record along with those during the week days.  Because you had like I said you had to be dope--'The Message' changed everything.  The perception of hip hop everything but now they're playing ours like that but now they even playing, they playing a record with us not even singing as much as 'It's Like That' talking about us because it was a royal form in hip hop.  It was a record and it was just us rapping showing the skill part of it.  So it was the local radio station deejays that was playing hip hop records and ours became superhot rotation.  And now mind you this is going on I'm still at St. John's University [Queens, New York] trying to figure life out.
Speaker 1: Okay now the label you signed with this is--
Speaker 2: Profile Records.
Speaker 1: --Profile is not [HistoryMaker] Russell Simmons.
Speaker 2: No Profile is not Def Jam [Def Jam Recordings] this is before Def Jam.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Profile Records was an independent label that took a chance with us.  We pressed the record up in every--Kurtis Blow was the first rapper signed to a major label by Russell.  Kurtis Blow he had 'The Breaks' and he had this record called 'Christmas Rappin'.'  Kurtis Blow actually had the first Christmas record.  But those records were huge for him.  Kurtis Blow was making albums.  He's signed to Mercury Records so Russell thinking I got Herc [DJ Kool Herc] signed, they definitely gonna sign my little brother [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run], this is good.  Every label we went to turned us down.  Aw it's too much like 'The Message' or it's not enough music.  Because Kurtis Blow's music and 'The Message' and 'Planet Rock' was very musical but it was just us rhyming over a beat and some scratching, it was empty.  So we got turned down.  Russell's last, last attempt of getting us signed was oh I'm a take a meeting with this Profile Records label.  They heard it and was like it's different, we'll take a chance on it.  Signed us to Profile Records and that legit- and now we got our foot in the door.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was the beginning of Run-DMC as a, a recording entity.
Story_ID: 521119
Speaker 1: There's a story in the book ['Ten Ways Not to Commit Suicide: A Memoir,' Darryl McDaniels] about you sitting in the Rathskeller of St. John's [St. John's University, Queens, New York].  And you actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah now we get signed and our record's playing on the weekend rap show then it starts moving to you know during the lunch time hours.  You know it wasn't like it was playing it like now they play rap every thirty seconds it's the same record over and over.  Back then it was once in the morning, lunch time and then in the night show and then on the weekend.  So I was sitting in, I'm at St. John's University, second semester realizing something.  Remember, remember I followed Douglas Hayes to St. John's University.  I followed him to Rice [Rice High School, New York, New York], I followed him to St. John's University.  When I followed him to St. John's University, I picked business management at St. John's University because I'm thinking it's gonna be like high school.  We was together, me and Douglas Hayes been together since kindergarten.  We was always in the same class and we was in different classes at Rice but we went to the same school so we was together all through high school.  I followed him to St. John's University thinking that it's gonna be just like elementary school [St. Pascal Baylon School, Queens, New York] and high school.  First day in high school, I get there and Doug ain't there.  I go to a payphone, this is before beepers and cell phones, call him, "Yo Doug where you at?"  He in bed, "Yo I ain't got no classes on the days you got classes."  Most frightening thing ever to me 'cause now I'm alone.  I hung up the phone, I'm on this big campus all alone taking classes that I don't like 'cause I didn't like business management.  I thought Doug was gonna be there with me.  So by second semester--now we recorded the record, we sign and everything, my record's playing on the deal but here I am sitting saying I don't like college because college is different from elementary and high school.  Nobody helps you.  You're on your own so I'm sitting there going man I really gotta grow up. I gotta really get serious about life and figure out.  I don't like accounting.  I don't like bookkeeping.  I don't like business law, none of that.  So right around the time and this was all a blessing for me.  I didn't like school.  I started cutting classes 'cause I didn't wanna go to that class.  So I'm cutting classes not knowing the easiest thing would have been to do is go tell my mother as soon as I went through this.  But I figure I don't wanna disappoint my parents [McDaniels' adoptive parents, Bannah Griffin McDaniels and Byford McDaniels].  So I'm trying to figure it out then it just gets to the point where you know eventually they're gonna see my attendance record so I'm like I gotta figure out what I'm a do so I go okay what can you do Darryl [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels]?  You can draw.  That's my passion.  You can draw.  So I was like I can either try architecture it has to do with drawing or graphic design, that has to be with drawing.  I didn't think of going to art school or I can draw the funnies in the local newspaper.  So I go home when I finally get my courage and say, "Mom, Dad can I sit down with y'all?"  And I go, "I'm gonna change my major.  I'm gonna try architecture.   I'm gonna try graphic designing anything that has to do with drawing 'cause that's what I can really do."  And then I go, "If that doesn't work out, I'll just get a job at the local newspaper drawing something in the funnies you know for ninety-nine dollars--dollars a week."  My father, rest in peace, bless his soul, he was more open to, "That's what the boy is gonna do as long as he happy."  My mother was, "Oh hell f-ing no.  You get your ass back upstairs and figure--,"  'cause she want college.  She you know what I'm saying, "You gonna be a doctor, you gonna be a lawyer," whatever, whatever.  So that's what I was going through.  When Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Simmons] did this shopping of the record and got signed at Profile Records, Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] like I said since he was eleven years old he seen the business.  So he's amp, he's calling me, "Yo D we got signed to a record--."  "Yeah Joe that's really cool but I'm figuring life out right now."  So one particular day during this, I'm, I'm torn between no I'm in the real world now, I gotta grow up I gotta grow up and figure out what I'm a do with my life.  So I'm sitting at St. John's University and the lunch was called the (unclear).  When you had a break for lunchtime or whatever you go sit there that's where all the students went.  Over the loud speaker you know they play the radio during the day while you're in there.  Over the loud speaker my record 'Sucker MC' ['Sucker M.C.'s'] comes on.  The whole lunch room gets up, "Yo this is the best record out right now.  Who are these guys?"  'Cause remember they didn't know they just heard us. Who is this Run-DMC guy and I'm sitting there all dejected like I should have stood up oh my--that's me, I'm--.  I just sit there and I said this: (Gesture) "That ain't gonna last," and I waved my hand like that.  So make a long story short that what was going on.
Story_ID: 521120
Speaker 1: The record gets hot, I'm still trying to figure out what I'm gonna change my mu- you know it's a transition period, it's a realization period.  The next thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This rec- this record is the performance that you did right after the high school graduation [from Rice High School, New York, New York], right?
Speaker 1: Yeah it was just something that we made.
Speaker 2: It's the same, same performance on the records, yet you didn't know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and everybody's loving it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I'm not even thinking about that.  So then Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] calls a couple of days later, "Yo our record is a hit across the nation.  Pack your bags, we're going on tour."  So yeah whatever.  So when I hang up the phone then I realize my god I never told my mother and father [McDaniels' adoptive parents, Bannah Griffin McDaniels and Byford McDaniels] I even made a record.  "Oh Joe's gonna kill me."  So I go downstairs, I go, "Mom, Dad can I have another talk with y'all?"  "Okay what's this about?"  I go, "Remember that night in August when I came home two in the morning," because when we went to record (unclear) you know, my thing was if I'm home eleven, midnight was kind of a stretch but me coming home at eleven at night was perfect you know what I'm saying 'cause it's late.  I got home at two in the morning the night of the record.  When I walked in the house my mother was like, "Boy where the hell was you at?"  I just said, "We was in Joe's attic," because we could either go in my basement or Joe's attic.  I didn't say we went to Greene's St. Recording studio [Greene St. Recording] and knew in this because it was all make believe.  They says they gonna put my record on the radio, don't mean nothing.  "So remember that night I came home two in the morning in August?"  "Yeah."  "Well I really wasn't at Joe's house.  We actually went to a studio, we made this record like you know 'The Message' and the Grandmaster Flash record and the name of the group is gonna be called Run-DMC and Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Simmons]," and it was always Russell say, "And Russell said it was gonna be this and that and people are liking the record and we gotta go on road and this and that boom bang."  My father just sat there, "What the hell is a Run-DMC and what the hell is rap?"  My mother was like, "Oh hell no mf-er but this is not gonna happen," whatever, whatever.  So I went upstairs like Joe gonna kill me this and that.  And then an idea came to me.  I went back downstairs and said, "Ma here's the deal," because Run had said, "Yo we gonna get paid."  I said, "Mom whatever money I get from doing these three or four shows with Run, I'll use all that money to pay for my own tuition."  "Okay you can go."  That's the only reason because it took a load off of them.  So I took a leave of absence from college [St. John's University, Queens, New York] 'cause I knew that after this song, this rap, I'll be fifty-two years old sitting there with my son [Darryl McDaniels, Jr.], "Boy, when I was nineteen years old I had a hit record for one summer.  It's this record called 'Run-DMC,' the name was my band, "It Was Like That" ["It's Like That"], "Sucker M.C.'s."  I took a leave of absence knowing next year I'll be back but then I'll have time to see what I'm a do, I'll reenlist, pick a better major.  I took a leave of absence and been absent ever since 'cause we put that record out, it was a hit single and we put out another single, it was a hit then Russell gets a big idea we gonna do an album.  The first album self-titled 'Run-DMC' by that time MTV [Music Television; MTV] is booming now.  We shoot a video and that's when it all exploded.  So here I am in the midst of that but the beautiful thing about it was in the early days of my career it was just me creating.  I had all these rhymes.  You know I used to work in the studio Russell used to say, "D [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels], we gotta beat.  What do you wanna say on this?  Go in there and just rhyme for us." And then I would rhyme and we would break the record up because Run was the star so Run would just go in there and his opening bars and then all the stuff that we did together was stuff that I wrote or been writing.  I would go in there like, "Let me hear the beat," okay I'll be Superman on this I'll be Batman on this.  It was all make believe for me.  So in the early years it was beautiful because it was just, it was just me letting out what was in me.  You know what I'm saying and they were happy because it was a hit but that for me it was just me releasing so it was--.  You know what I'm saying I didn't understand really what, I understood we getting money now you know what I'm saying I can buy whatever I want this and tha,t but it wasn't me saying I'm a get money and I'm a be famous and this and that it was just me being Darryl, which was the beautiful thing about it.

Speaker 1: Yeah we were just sta- I think we were talking about Jason Mizell--
Speaker 2: Jam Master--Jason Mizell.
Speaker 1: His name, you named him right, Jam Master [Jam Master Jay] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I came up with the name Jam Master.  What had happened was when me and Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] recorded the record, the record started getting hot, now it's time to go perform and then we didn't think about this in the beginning.  Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Simmons] was like, "Who's gonna be the deejay?"  And Run said, "Oh my god, we, we didn't think about that part."  So what we, what Run did was we had to look at the deejays that was in our neighborhood of Hollis, Queens, New York who were doing the block parties and the park parties and the house parties.  It's a bunch of crews, different crews.  And Jay, Run chose Jay because remember I said it was two types of hip hop.  It was the club hip hop deejay thing and there was the radio, there was three types.  Well three types of deejaying.  There was the club deejay hip hop, there was the radio deejay, there was radio--four types, the radio deejay that went to clubs that people came to see and then there was the street deejay that was trying to do all the Grandmaster Flash, Grandmaster Theodore [sic. Grand Wizard Theodore] stuff.  Jay could come to your party, come to your mother and father's house and deejay at the wedding or the cookout and make those older folks happy.  But he could also go to the park and deejay and make the young people happy.  So he had the best of both worlds.  He could do the adult deejay thing and he can do the hip hop deejay thing.  So Run say, "Yo Jay you wanna be on--me and Darryl McDaniels [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] made a record together, you wanna be our deejay?  You getting paid too."  Jay was like, "Me I get to pay--I get paid to do what I do free in the park?  I'm with it."  So that's how Jay became it.  So what had happened was when we started touring, people were confused 'cause people come to see Run-DMC and it was three guys on the stage.  Who's the other guys?  And even if you never saw us live, you would go okay Run, there's a D, Run there's a D, there's a M, there's a C like how many people in the band or whatever?  So that became confusing.  Me being the creative guy with the imagination I was like, "I got you Jay."  I said, "Don't worry."  Originally Jay's name was gonna be Jazzy Jay but you can't be Jazzy Jay because there's already a Jazzy Jay with Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation [Universal Zulu Nation].  And one of the biggest things in hip hop is in our generation, in my mother and father [McDaniels' adoptive parents, Bannah Griffin McDaniels and Byford McDaniels] generation was called being a copycat but now in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s] a biter means you duplicate me.  So the biggest thing in hip hop you can be a copycat or a biter.  So I said, "You can't be Jazzy Jay because there's already a Jazzy Jay."  Also for me I took it deeper.  There's a lot of grandmasters, there's Grandmaster Flash, Grandmaster Dee from Whodini, then you had Grand Wizard Theodore, you had Grandmixer D.ST [Grandmixer DXT].  I didn't even want him to use those, I think those tag names.
Speaker 1: Now these names are from kung fu movies, aren't they?  These grandmaster names (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kung fu movies yeah.  So that being said as a little kid in New York City [New York, New York], what was our influences?  Fred Flintstone, Bugs Bunny, 'Looney Tunes,' the cartoons that was on, 'Lost in Space,' 'The Addams Family,' 'The Munsters,' and kung fu movies.  Hip hop is kung fu movies, cartoons and music.  That's why you know you look at the Wu-Tang Clan.  So we were taking titles, characters and descriptions from our comic books, anything that was pop culture that was influencing us became titles and descriptions in hip hop.  So there was a grandmaster, there was a grand wizard and a, and a grandmixer.  I said Jay I got y'all.  I went home and I was like he can't be Jazzy Jay 'cause that's taken.  But his name is Jason so it's gotta be something Jay then I went like this oh, I got it.  The jam is two things.  The jam is the actual record.  You go up to the deejay and say yo deejay can you play my favorite jam?  The jam is also the party, the whole party.  Yo that jam last night was crazy good so I said, "Jam Master Jay will be the master of it all, he's the master of the music and the event."  So the next day, "Yo Jay I got your name."  "What is it?"  "You gonna be the Jam--," it sound so good saying right now so imagine how it felt to him when he first heard it.  "You're gonna be the Jam Master Jay 'cause you're the master of it all."  He was like, "Jam Master Jay, yo that got a great ring to it."  And that created a whole new entity, a whole new personality, we're not biting, we're not even using the grand moniker.  This is the j- it's a whole new thing and that's how Jam Master Jay became Jam Master Jay (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 521122
Speaker 1: I read that he might be related to the Mizell Brothers, the record producers Larry [Larry Mizell] and Fonce Mizell, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --it was not a close relationship 'cause you don't even know about that, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: I mean I know Jay [Jam Master Jay].
Speaker 1: --people can look it up if they want to you know as we talk about this, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they should, they should.  I just know Jay before the deejay thing.  The thing that made Jay a good deejay is what he was a musician.  You know what I'm saying.  Most, most, the best producers and the best producers are either deejays that know music, not just one music, I'm talking about music, folk, jazz, polka, rhythm and blues all of that but the best producers are musicians.  The best deejays are former musicians.  So in that way hip hop will make, always maintain musical foundation.  Like a lot of guys now making music don't even know where the music came from you know what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: What did Jason Mizell play?
Speaker 2: Jay was a drummer.  And if Jay played--and Andrew Jackson High School [Queens, New York] they had a music class I mean they do now but it's not important.  I'm talking about you from the hood you should go to music class man.  'Cause you wanna play James Brown 'Funky Drummer.'  There was just, there was just something inspirational and motivational and personally gratifying to be in music.  It wasn't called corny or soft.  "Why you in music class, let's go hang out."  It was something that young people aspired to so Jay was a drummer.  Jay said, "Man the reason why I knew I had to get good grades if I didn't keep my grades up I couldn't be in music class."  So that love of music made him a good deejay you know what I'm saying which later on made him a great producer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So if, if there's musical blood in there you know what I'm saying.  Forget about him being a deejay for Run-DMC his love of music must be, it must be hereditary somewhere.  It's coming from somewhere.
Speaker 1: Also what I read from the book is that he--several things.  First of all you two were very close, right?
Speaker 2: Right he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, y'all was like--
Speaker 2: Yeah me and Jay, Jay never treated me like I was just there for the business you know what I'm saying.  As it started blowing off we never sat around and talked about business.  Him and Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] talked about business more and when the business came that's all it became for me and Run it was like the business 'cause the success was crazy.  Even, even in the midst of all that Jay still, Jay was cool, Jay was--I don't wanna use the normal, Jay was I can't even say if he was smart, I can't say Jay was smart enough to not let me not be Darryl [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels], Jay was just the dude that didn't let Darryl--Darryl never got lost in the DMC you know what I'm saying.  With everybody else as you read in my book you know 'Ten Ways Not to Commit Suicide' ['Ten Ways Not to Commit Suicide: A Memoir,' Darryl McDaniels], so everybody else just became you gotta be this DMC guy.  Jay didn't--that--DMC was only needed when it was time to do the DMC things.  When he is not doing DMC things, I'm looking at you Darryl.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know what I'm saying.
Story_ID: 521123
Speaker 1: Me and Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] was close 'cause me and Run's closeness came from--Run lived up on the crazy part of Hollis [Queens, New York] you know what I'm saying.  When he started coming down to my neighborhood it was peaceful.  He was like, "I like it down here."  So Run stopped even hanging on his own block to come down on my end of Hollis 'cause the guys down there we had fun with sports, it was normal you know we had a life you know what I'm saying.  Up on the other--Run always had to watch his back up on the other end of Hollis 'cause it's crazy up there.  Down on my end it was peaceful, creative and artistic, you didn't have to worry about nothing you know what I'm saying.  So me and Run I remember when I first started hanging with Run, when he first started coming around a lot because I'm hanging with Butter [Douglas Hayes], we had this place called the PAL, the Police Athletic League, we had night center and Run would always call my house late at night and now when he told me this.  "I'd always call your house Darryl McDaniels [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] and you're never home."  Where, I always wondered what the hell is he doing out at 9:30.  Police Athletic League was a night center.  You had to sign up and register.  You get a card from seven to nine on the weeknights you go to the basketball, pool, arts and crafts it was a place for us to go.  It was a beautiful thing, kept us off the street.  So Run would always wonder where the hell I was at PAL, so he joined PAL to hang with me and stuff like that.  So Run's hanging with me and I'm hanging with Butter so once we started doing the deejay thing in the basement me and him would really was into it more than the rest of my crew so that was closeness you know what I'm saying, that was our closeness and that, that bond of the love of this hip hop thing is what made me and Run really close.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And Jay [Jam Master Jay] was from the same side of town as Run?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jay was from the middle of it but see the beautiful thing about Jay was this I think I said this in my book, Jay could hang with the thugs and the gangsters and he can hang with the nerds and the geeks because he was into the nerdy--Jay was this type of guy.  When he was around, he wouldn't let his thug friends rob, pick on or bully any other nerd guys.  So the nerd guys was happy when Jay was around 'cause he was like us weak you know what I'm saying.  We, we defended our neighborhood but when Jay wasn't around the nerds, the guy Jay ain't here so he ain't gotta listen to him.  You know what I'm saying, so Jay was, Jay was the deejay playing, Jay was, Jay was people say Jay was the connection of me and Run, he made us work.  So in the neighborhood, Jay was the basketball player, he was into basketball.  Jay hung with the thugs but Jay also did normal skateboard stuff like that.  So Jay was kind of the, the continuity of the, the--Jay was the good and the bad but would never let the bad overtake the good.  He was--let me rephrase that.  Jay was with the good and the bad but he would never let the bad destroy the good.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know what I'm saying.  Jay you know all of Jay's friends was in and out of jail you know what I'm saying.  Jay hung with them but he see--you gotta understand he didn't see them as the criminals.  He saw them as the guys he grew up with--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know what I'm saying.
Story_ID: 521124
Speaker 1: The style of Run-DMC--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) your visual presentation, I mean it's one thing to be on a record--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and everybody hear your voice. Like you say there was an anonymity there but Run-DMC I know the first thing that struck me about Run-DMC was when I first heard about Run-DMC was a look.
Speaker 2: Our look.
Speaker 1: Those hats, the gold chains--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the Adidas, all and the leather jackets a lot of this is Jay [Jam Master Jay] right?  This is where Jay--
Speaker 2: Yes.  When we first started me and Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] wasn't coordinated visually.  He wore what he wore, I wore what I wore.  When we tried to get coordinated, I think there's one picture of us in one of our first shows without Jam Master Jay by the way it was just me and Run going to perform our record was at this place called the Disco Fever [Bronx, New York].  We got on these crazy looking checker jackets.  We would just go in our fathers' closets and yo pull out something that would match.  Before we put Jay--remember I said we had to go tell Jay to be the deejay before that me and Run was all over the place.  When we did our first--one of our first shows with Jay, Jay missed because we said okay Jay's in the band now, Jay's in the group now, we're doing this show and Jay didn't know that we had to leave early to go do sound check so the show probably was like we probably hit the stage like ten well we had to be there at seven to do a sound check.  At seven o'clock Jay went down to the Jamaica Avenue to shop for clothes so we had to leave him.  And when we told Jay, we talked to Jay about it later on he said he cried so never again he was getting left.  The second time that we had the show locally, we told Jay we gonna meet at 6:30 he wasn't gonna be left.  So we pull up to his house.  During this period, Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Simmons] was always telling us, "Y'all need stage outfits," you know what I'm saying because Gap Band [The Gap Band], Marvin Gaye, the Parliament, Funkadelics even all the rappers before us Grandmaster Flash and Furious Five they had their regular clothes and then when it's time to perform, you put on stage clothes.  Afrika Bambaataa if you look at Afrika Bambaataa and Zulu Nation [Universal Zulu Nation], they look like Parliament and Funkadelics.  So the thing was now that you're recording in the music business you're gonna have a change of clothes for stage.  So our whole journey me and Run was like yeah but we're not wearing that, we're not wearing what Parliament wears and we're not wearing what The Rolling Stones wearing.  If you look at the first rappers which was Grandmaster Flash, Zulu Nation, Kurtis Blow, the first rappers are the first rappers so they had no idols to look up to.  But rap idols the first rappers' idols were Parliament-Funkadelic, The Gap Band, Con Funk Shun and The Rolling Stones.  So if you look at Grandmaster Flash for instance they're dressed like Rick James and The Rolling Stones and the funk bands with spikes and fur right because they had no rappers to look up to.  Me and Run's idols was then when he was in the park though.  So when they was in the park they were Pumas and Adidas and Adidas suits and the Gazelles and the Kangols those--that's how we saw flash them before the music business.  So Russell was always telling us once we made records, y'all need stage clothes well we was like we not wearing what they wearing on stage.  We rather wore what they wore when they woke up in the morning, that's why me and Run was all over the place but this particular day we pull up to pick Jam Master Jay up from his house.  He comes out the front door, he got on a white with the black stripe shell toe Adidas.  No laces in them.  But the flaps are standing up like tombstones just like billboards.  He got on black Lee jeans 'cause Run-DMC we'd always rhyme, "But our Lee jeans that we wear," he had on black Lee jeans.  He got on a black Adidas jacket.  The black Adidas jacket with the white stripes.  He got on this black Godfather hat and he got the strings of his sneakers just hanging around his neck and when he walked out the front door, Russell goes that--before Russell could even speak me and Run go, "That's our stage look," right then and there.  So that Run--the Godfather hat, the sneakers and now the sneakers and the no laces came from this, Jay didn't wanna waste time lacing them up 'cause he thought he might get left so he took the new sneakers out the box, threw them on his feet and just came out the house that way and that whole show, me and Run still had laces.  I think I matter of fact I got on Pumas or something but me and Run had on Adidas but they were laced up with the fat B boy laces.  Remember the fat thick laces that the break dancers would wear?  That's--we noticed that during this whole day Jay's sneakers stayed on his feet so the next show after that me and Run had on the black Godfather hats.  Jay took us to where he shopped, black godfather hats, black Adidas t-shirts, black Lees with the white Adidas with the black stripes and then we realized that instead of just wearing Adidas jacket and Lees 'cause in the summertime it's too hot to wear the jeans, we can wear the whole track suit and that became Run-D.M.C. signature look.  'Cause Jay was everything for us.  Jay is our style, Jay is our look and Jay is also our sound.
Story_ID: 521125
Speaker 1: So Jay [Jam Master Jay] was our whole visual, audio presence.  All me and Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] had to do was just write the lyrics and Jay took care of the rest.
Speaker 2: So is that how it really--I mean did he choose the beats and the, and the--?
Speaker 1: Well we--he, he would, he would--right.  Since he was a deejay he was always doing music.  I mean every now and then I mean there was probably six or seven times where Run would come, "Yo Jay I wanna do something with this beat."  And Jay would put it together and make it a song you know what I'm saying.  Or if I had a beat when we did "Rock Box" for instance we was just trying to make Billy Squier's "Big Beat" ["The Big Beat"] which was a rock record.  It was like, "Yo D [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] I know you like rock records," and we wanted to get away from sampling you know like doing it ourselves so Jay would pull out the drum machine and Jay do a beat that's like big beat.  So Jay would, would make, we would just come with a beat or a base line or an idea and Jay would make it a song.  That was his role.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  All right so this is so he so when you made the, was it 'Rock Box' right because the first video (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah that was the yeah rock the first single off the album remember when I said now Russell's [HistoryMaker Russell Simmons] reaching now we did a single, single.  Now Russell's thinking that we can do an album and everybody there's no way a rap album is gonna sell 'cause it's all singles.  "Rock Box" was the first single off Run-DMC's first self-titled album ['Run-DMC'] and 'cause MTV [Music Television; MTV] is blowing now, Russell wanted to shoot a video for it.  So "Rock Box," "Walk This Way," which came later on 'Raising Hell' album, "Walk" is a tongue twister.  "Walk This Way" isn't the first rock rap record.  The first rock rap record is "Rock Box" which was on the first album which was the first rap video on MTV.  That was '84 [1984].  Then in '85 [1985] we did "King of Rock" then in '86 [1986] we did "Walk This Way."  So "Walk This Way" was the third genesis of Run-DMC's so called rock rap (unclear) but "Rock Box" was the first time we shot a video.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it got us on MTV.
Speaker 2: So you all went national pretty fast?
Speaker 1: Yes it's because of MTV we in everybody's living room.  When we made "Rock Box" and got on MTV, we didn't have MTV in Queens [New York] yet.  Only people in Manhattan [New York] had MTV.  So we was like what the hell is MTV?  We didn't even know what it was.  But because of MTV took our notoriety to a whole another level that we didn't know 'cause remember we didn't have MTV.
Speaker 2: With you being was your music playing overseas at that time too?
Speaker 1: Yes, but we didn't know that.  We didn't know that the label was sending test pressings and white labels overseas.  We didn't know that we was buzzing globally.  It wa- our music was going globally.
Speaker 2: You know that's part of a phenomenon of Run-DMC the national aspect of it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah we didn't, we didn't find out--right we didn't know that we was international until "Walk This Way."  But all of our music was going over there, from '84 [1984] to '86 [1986] the seeds had been planted globally.
Story_ID: 521126
Speaker 1: By the time "Walk This Way" comes out.
Speaker 2: And by the time "Walk This Way" comes out it explodes because now here we are before one of the most iconic groups in rock music you know what I'm saying.  We buzzing, we making it you know we did "Rock Box" and "King of Rock" which brought that whole rock audience to us.  So now we don't just have the urban boys, now we have white boys and everybody, everybody's together.
Speaker 1: I tell you what I thought.  I'm not the only one who thought this.  I thought especially when I picked up your book ['Ten Ways Not to Commit Suicide: A Memoir,' Darryl McDaniels] first and said well you went to Catholic school and nerdy guys.  I said he's probably got about the rock Aerosmith to the group but you were really weren't for that at first, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, I wanted to do--we didn't wanna make "Walk This Way."  We wanted--see what happened was this, rock records was--before rap was recorded remember the break beats, disco records always had a baseline for the emcee to rap over.  James Brown always had a funky drummer break, one, two, three, four get it for the rapper emcee to say his rap over.  Folk records but in the same deejay crates I'm talking about before "Rapper's Delight" were a lot of rock record break beats.  "Another One Bites the Dust" by Queen, "Dun, dun, dun, another one bites the dust"; "Walk This Way" Aerosmith; "Tom Sawyer" by Rush.  So there was a lot of rock records that had break beats that every Flash [Grandmaster Flash], Theodore [Grand Wizard Theodore], Cold Crush [Cold Crush Brothers], every deejay and emcee would play and rap over a rock break beat.  It was there from the beginning.  Nobody was making it on records so when we did it on "Rock Box" it was like oh my god do you hear this?  It wasn't new to us; it was new to the world.  Then we did "King of Rock" saying we're the kings of rock because we did that.  When we did "Walk This Way" what was gonna happen was remember Jay [Jam Master Jay] was the neighborhood deejay, he was the block party deejay, he was the hip hop deejay so he knew that I liked Aero- I didn't even know the record was called "Walk This Way" 'cause the deejay would never let it play that far.  When I heard it on the tape when I heard Flash do it when I heard Bambaataa [Afrika Bambaataa] do it, when I heard the Cold Crush do it, I would only hear stet a do, do, stet a do do, stet (rhythm of "Walk This Way"), right when the singing comes back to the front of the record so I never heard I didn't even know what the record sounded like.  Jay knew I loved that beat so Jay said, "We're gonna sample this record and you and Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] are gonna make a record out of it," so originally "Walk This Way" went like this.  It was that music with me going on because it's '86 [1986] now.  It was "(rhythm of "Walk This Way") I'm DMC [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] in the place to be I'm the best emcee in history, I been rhyming on the mic since '83 [1983] there will never be an emcee better than me (rhythm of "Walk This Way") I'm DJ Run and I'm number one, I'm here to get it done," and that's how the record originally went.  At our time, the first two albums was produced by this man named Larry Smith who's the greatest hip hop producer ever that nobody knows about he produced Run-DMC's first two albums and went on to produce Whodini's groundbreaking album ['Escape'] with the "Freaks Come Out At Night," "Friends" and "Five Minutes of Funk."   Crazy, and Larry was a bass player in a funk band so you know the music connection here.  But by 'Raising Hell' our producer was this young man named Rick Rubin who said, "Don't do, don't sample this Aerosmith record, do it over the way the band originally did it."  Now when he said that me and Run was totally against it.  Jay rest in peace was like, "Yo that might be incredible this and that.  Let's do it."  But me and Run was totally against it.  So me and Run had to learn the record that we never heard.  We rapped over it but we never heard it.  So me and Run when we heard it, when we heard, "Back Seat Lover, hiding beneath the cover," we was like that's not it hip hop, that's not rap.  Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five would have laughed us out of the, laughed us on the microphone, we're not doing it.  Me and Run refused to do the record but with a little enthusiastic inspiration from Jay and Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Simmons] and Rick Rubin, they finally convinced us to do it.
Story_ID: 521127
Speaker 1: And we did it and the moral to that story is me and Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] never wanted to do it even when it was finished and recorded.  Me and Run looked at them and said, "Y'all can like this record all y'all want, y'all better not put it out as a single."  So they put "Walk This Way" out as a single behind our backs.  They released it when 'Raising Hell' was released they released "My Adidas" and "Peter Piper" was a single, they also released "Walk This Way" and sent it with "My Adidas" and "Peter Piper" to, they sent "Walk This Way" to all the rock stations but they also sent "Walk This Way" to all the black and urban stations and when me and Run got whiff of that we was about to complain but it took us through the roof.  So when I speak on this the moral to the story especially to young people, or anybody, always be open to try something new 'cause it could not only change your life, it could change the world.  Because me and Run was totally against it but it was crazy because when the black people heard it they thought it was cool.  They was, "Oh yeah that "Walk This Way" record by Run-DMC," me and Run was scratching our heads.
Speaker 2: I know it was like three black kids that lived above me here in Chicago [Illinois] then who played it first.  They--
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: --were the ones who taught my son how to play Atari.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah I remember Atari.
Speaker 2: They was skateboarding that day.  I remember out in front of the house and they were playing I mean it came on and they turned it up (rhythm of "Walk This Way") and you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And with us rapping those lyrics.
Speaker 2: --yeah, yeah.  I think Rolling Stone here says he said, "Rap and rock had a primal energy, both rap and rock"--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and you put those two forces together--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --and what it did it shook well this is when you all really cross over--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --into the white market too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I knew what it felt like to be Mick Jagger.  That's my joke.  It was like well you know all the fun we was just having fun making these rock records and rhyming.  Now it's whoa, Mick Jagger.
Speaker 2: DMC penetrates white youth consciousness.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Well what it did was we was divided and they realized that's the same.  See in the 'Walk This Way' video Steven Tyler takes a mic stand and knocks the wall down.  People say, "D [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] that didn't happen in the video.  That happened in real life."  So all the rock you know everything was separate when Run-DMC knocked down the wall and let us know black kids, white kids we go through the same thing.  Peer pressure, school, issues with your brother you know what I'm saying, parents, you eat, you sleep, you go to the bathroom so when we did that it let the white, it brought us, it brought people together man which was crazy and unheard of.  Because all the music was separate.  It was almost like only white people listen to rock and only black people listen to hip hop, but that wasn't true.

Speaker 1: This is interesting stuff and now this is--so during the mid-'80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you've got like a lot of rappers like making it big you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we opened the door.
Speaker 1: You all--yeah.
Speaker 2: We opened the floodgates for all the rappers to follow (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So here was like everybody from I mean from KRS-One and Queen Latifah, Sir Mix-a-Lot, Tone Loc, X Clan, Fat Boys [The Fat Boys].
Speaker 2: Fat Boys can't forget about them.
Speaker 1: Heavy D I mean it was just tons of people.
Speaker 2: Yeah everybody whether you was a solo rapper or a group, all the groups A Tribe Called Quest, Naughty by Nature, De La Soul all the groups Public Enemy wanted to be us.  "We're who we are because of them."  Even the solo rappers.  They saw what we was doing and how we was doing but the beautiful thing they realize we can do that but I can be myself.  Sort of like me when I went to Rice [Rice High School, New York, New York] and realized I don't have to go, "Hip hop ti hibbit the disco man," I'm not a man I'm a kid I wanna rhyme about ice cream.  So we showed them whatever who they were at that time they could do that but we opened the doors so the world and industry knew it was cool and legit to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this, this universal (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Like you said when we crossed over and went global because of MTV [Music Television; MTV] hip hop if it wasn't for MTV hip hop would have still took a few more years to get out of the underground, it was the underground.  We had our own little world.  We doing our own little shows and ev- .  MTV brought it in everybody's living room so those white kids can relate to--they wasn't--put it like this they wasn't scared of KRS anymore and Flavor [Flavor Flav] and Eric B. and Rakim and Sir Mix-a-Lot you know what I'm saying.  It was like we were all in the same schools, all going in the same shopping areas, all going to the same movies but it was all separate.  The metal head kid was listening to metal and this and that but we came along the metal the white kids knew they could listen to Chuck D talk about Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] and it was cool because it's just information is what they do.  Just like we know we could listen to you know for me as a kid I saw the similarity those white kids could to Chuck D talk about Farrakhan, and KRS-One wouldn't talk about black history or Public Enemy and KRS-One talk about current events in the ghetto the same way when I was little I was attracted to listening to Bob Dylan talk about social issues.  I can listen to Neil Young, Crosby, Stills, Young, and Nash [sic. Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young] talk about the shooting at Kent University [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] through their record 'Ohio' or I can listen to John Fogerty sing about the war [Vietnam War] in 'Fortune Son' [sic. 'Fortunate Son'].  I was a little black kid growing up in New York [New York] I look wow these guy singing deep, deep stuff you know what I'm saying.  And you know talking about Kennedy's assassination so when we open that door that black music, black hip hop music wasn't scary to the white kids because they knew it existed.  You know some of the black kids, some of the white kids knew the kids that was doing the deejays and emcee.  They just thought they couldn't do it.  And the black kids thought that only white kids have long hair and play rock and roll not knowing it all came from the blues in the first place.
Story_ID: 521129
Speaker 1: Now here you are, from everything I read Run-DMC is as you said the emergent you know rap group and everybody who follows basically is looking at what Run-DMC is doing and following in a sense.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: But anyway Run-DMC is setting the tone for everybody else now right in this--
Speaker 2: No, no I mean what Run-DMC--we didn't--people say I know y'all didn't invent it but y'all started all of this but we did.  The people that really started it is Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Fantastic Five, Treacherous Three, Funky Four Plus One, Cold Crush Four [Cold Crush Brothers], Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation [Universal Zulu Nation], Kurtis Blow, Busy.
Speaker 1: Busy Bee.
Speaker 2: Yeah. All of the rappers yeah all of the rappers Kool Herc [DJ Kool Herc] everybody before Run-DMC started this.  Run-DMC's role in this was this on the record 'My Adidas' when we did the record 'My Adidas,' I said what Run-DMC did, "We took the beat from the street and put it on TV for the world to see."  That was our role in this.  We didn't start it.  We came--everything Run-DMC does and did was what everybody before us was doing.  But our role in this fell right in the timeslot of where were we--our role was to be the ones to present it to the world.  But once we did that, you gotta think about it, once we did that, we showed that there could be diversity and uniqueness in this music.  It didn't all have to be--in the beginning it was considered black ghetto music, is what hip hop was.  And every record was about life in the ghetto, growing up in the ghetto, the struggles of this and that.  Me personally I knew in the dirt poor ghetto there was good things going on.  That's why I rhymed about family, that's why I rhymed about school, that's why I rhymed about eating chicken and collard greens.  Everything did have to be my father's a pimp and pusher and this and that, he shot them and this and that, it didn't have to be about the dark bad things.  You could rhyme about the good, but that being said, what Run-DMC did was allow for De La Soul, Public Enemy, Fat Boys [The Fat Boys], Naughty by Nature, A Tribe Called Quest, Slick Rick, you know what I'm saying, N.W.A. [Niggaz Wit Attitudes] even we allowed for everybody to bring what it is they wanted to present in a universal way you know what I'm saying.  I think that one of the things that we, we can be untouched in is our show was always authentic hip hop.  Meaning we never had dab machines, we never had props, we never had dancers.  It was Run, Run-DMC just wanted to be the best deejay and emcees that you ever saw.  I think we accomplished that but we didn't start it, we just showed that this is the starting point but you could go any place that you want to with it.  But over the years, a lot of the business has diluted and polluted our culture.  I'm not talking about music making, we created hip hop so that our, the viewer or the listener or the partaker in it could realize they didn't have to only be those circumstances that they come from.  Now hip hop says it's cool to be a gangsta, it's cool to be a thug; it's cool to sell drugs.  No those are things that people did because they thought they had no other alternatives.  You know I got dudes that come up to me and say, "Yo D [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] just because you said it, just because you said you went to St. John's University [Queens, New York] and went to school I had dropped out of high school.  I didn't think a diploma was important.  But because you said it that's its cool to have that I went and got a GED [General Educational Development] just so I can say I got on glasses, I got on a gold chain, I got on Adidas and I got a GED too, that's part of that package."  So I think that's what Run-DMC did, we made positive, positivity gangsta.  [HistoryMaker] Wyclef Jean once said DMC is the only emcee that can rhyme about chicken and collard greens, St. John's University and Christmas and make it gangsta.  That's what we did you know what I'm saying, we didn't brag about selling drugs, we didn't brag about having sex, we didn't brag about how many guns we had.  We, we rapped about how many sneakers we had and where those sneakers went.  It's different saying I got money and I got more sneakers than you.  We talked about the places those sneakers went, which is more deeper than just talking about I got this and I got that.  It's where can this all go.  So Run-DMC showed where hip hop could go.
Story_ID: 521130
Speaker 1: Now but there still is--you got this kind of negative kind of vibe that follows Run-DMC and a lot of other groups, not just you but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --there's a--I have here a note there was a brawl in Long Beach [California] I mean what--one year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah 1986--
Speaker 1: --eighty-six [1986]
Speaker 2: --at the height.
Speaker 1: --people got hurt and--
Speaker 2: It was a gang fight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a gang fight at a Run-DMC concert because gangbangers love Run-DMC.  It was just; it was just that perfect storm where the gangs happen to all be at the concert at the same time.  Because put it like this, the gangbangers love Run-DMC, the college students love Run-DMC, the girls love Run-DMC, the guys love DMC, mothers love DMC, brothers love Run-DMC.  The teachers love Run-DMC, everybody loves Run-DMC.  At this particular concert, it was two rival factions of a gang that happened to encounter each other and once they started fighting it was a catalyst that caused everybody else to start fighting but it's not because of the music.  You know music doesn't cause people to fight.  An Ozzy [Ozzy Osbourne] song doesn't cause suicide.  People commit suicide and gangs fight, you know what I'm saying.  You know there might be a, a fistfight at a concert or gang fight, a gang fight at a Run-DMC concert is no different from the hooligans fighting at soccer games in Europe.  It's you against us.  Our hood against your hood, your clique against my clique, your team against my team (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you all were continuously blamed for not just for--
Speaker 2: We got blamed for it because we come from them places (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 521131
Speaker 1: But rappers in general were being blamed for all, every--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) every negative behavior of youth at a certain point.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And well the (laughter)--we're not causing, we're not causing what's going--just--there was shooting and fighting and killing and crime--crime existed before the rappers did.  The problem now is a lot of rappers talk about crime like it's cool, they don't speak out against it.  Now hip hop never said you're wrong for doing what you do, hip hop said you shouldn't do it.  Here's why, here's what you could be doing.  Now in, in hip hop it's cool to be a thug, it's cool to sell drugs and destroy your own neighborhoods, it's cool to shoot everybody up you know what I'm saying, it's cool to have a gun, it's cool to be illiterate, it's cool to be negative, it's cool to disrespect women.  We created hip hop so our young brothers and sisters didn't have to name themselves after drug lords.  We created hip hop so our young men didn't have to idolize Al Pacino, portraying Scarface [sic. Tony Montana] a drug lord.  We created hip hop so our young people didn't have to look at John Gotti like that's something cool you know what I'm saying.  If hip hop is so good, if a Killer Mike and Chuck D said this, Killer Mike said if hip hop is so good, what happened to the time when our young black brothers and sisters was proud to display the name of their university on their hoodie you know what I'm saying.  What happened to the time where you know when we took our pictures, even though we have material stuff on, we never pointed at our watches or we never held our chains up, or we never pointed at--look at the way our young people take pictures now.  Point at the car.  We pointed at us.  We had a Rolls Royce behind us, but in the picture me I'm important so that shows you where the mind state of our young people is at you know what I'm saying, holding up the champagne like oh look I got Moet [Moet and Chandon].
Speaker 1: There's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's important, no that's not important.  So when we talked about our crime, when we talked about our drug, we told the stories, but we always had an alternative and an answer.  We always had the now what.  Now what DMC?  Now what KRS-One?  Now what Chuck D?  You go to a Public Enemy concert right now it's more white people than black people because the black peoples going I don't wanna hear that corny positive stuff.  What?  That's the thing that's gonna change you and get you rich.  That's the thing that's gonna change your neighborhoods.  So for us Run-DMC the same way a lot of hip hoppers will tell the drug dealers' story and people get happy about it, we, we didn't let that record end there.  We said hold up, no, it's not time to stop yet.  Let me tell you this.  And they go, "Wow, that's possible?  Oh, I could do that?  You see that in me?"  But now we're just saying the only thing is you can either be a rapper, a drug dealer or a gangbanger or an athlete.
Story_ID: 521132
Speaker 1: When hip hop told our young brothers and sisters you could be a journalist, you could be a writer, you can be a scientist, you can be an artist, you can be a designer, you can be a professor.  You know what I'm saying?  You can be a painter.  Now it seems like hip hop, hip hop--this is one of my sayings, hip hop didn't create just rappers.  But if look at hip hop right now you think hip hop rapper you know what I'm saying.  Some of the most hip hop people are, are, are directors, script writers and soundmen and engineers you know what I'm saying, that's what's missing from it.  See our presentation was but you got to understand we got that from the rappers, Run-DMC from Queens [New York] who had houses got these motivation inspirations from rappers who had none of that.  Melle Mel and them they lived in the Bronx [New York] in Harlem [New York, New York] and Manhattan [New York] in the '70s [1970s].  The Bronx was burning but they chose--they took it upon themselves to rhyme about possibilities and when we receive that we changed it.  Now you can almost say it's the same thing.  Grandmaster [Grandmaster Flash], I mean 'Rappers Delight' rapped about stuff that we wanted, that we wished we had.  But by speaking it we got it you know what I'm saying.  Now we're talking about over and over this is what's going on and it's not taking us nowhere, hip hop took us somewhere and now it seems like we're going backwards because none of the artists are bold enough to speak up and say school is cool.  The, the best rap records are records that don't use profanity you know what I'm saying (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah but that was--
Speaker 1: But do we get that now?  The best rap--the most important records is by Tupac was 'Dear Mama' and 'Brenda had a Baby' [sic. 'Brenda's Got a Baby'], that's why Tupac's a god to us not because of thug life and the negative stuff.  People look at Pac, "Yeah he's a rebel and this and that you know he went to jail."  You think jail was a good place?  But they think it's a good place because Pac was there, no.  Pac's, Pac's power in hip hop was 'Dear Mama,' he did a record about his mother and he did a record about teenage pregnancy that's why we respect him you know what I'm saying, not because he went to jail and he got thug life and he smoked blunts and Hennessey.  That's irrelevant.  What makes Tupac great is a man from where he from who looks like he look can have that come out of him.  The same way Melle Mel said, "Broken glass everywhere, people--don't push me 'cause--" ['The Message'], this is young people, see the reason why hip hop was powerful was we speak what our parents feel.  We speak--I speak what my grandfather--Chuck D speaking on his grandfather struggle and his mother's struggle now.  That's what's powerful, not that yo I'm a get this money by any means necessary because you gonna first of all you using an illegal way to get it that's now I'm not saying being sneaky is, is, is personally wrong to you, but what you're doing is destroying.  "I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm big pusher man I'm cooking it up in the kitchen," you ain't no, you ain't no Colombian drug lord.  The people you selling drugs is in the five or six block radius of you and those--you killing yourself so hip hop said here we are, here's where we gonna go and we gonna get there.  Now it's going backwards you know what I'm saying 'cause people get frustrated and want somebody else to do it for them.  See we were young individuals, nine to twenty-five years old taking matters in their own hand.
Story_ID: 521133
Speaker 1: Two things, you all sort of fought back in a song called 'Mary Mary' you know with the video (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh against labels and discrimination --
Speaker 1: Yeah the critique of--yeah, the critique of--
Speaker 2: --the critique of our music.
Speaker 1: --rapping in general and D- DMC, Run-DMC--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Parental just, the parental now just, see here there's two levels just to have a record with the F word and sex should be labeled so you know I don't want my kid to hear that if he's a kid.  He can't hear that 'til he's eighteen years old.  But to label all are bad just because of a few bad elements is completely wrong.  You got Disney [The Walt Disney Company] and you got porno movies.  You got G movies, you got PG and R movies.  That's the way to describe them you know what I'm saying.  You're not gonna let your kids go to a porno movie and if you go to a rated R movie, you're gonna go with them so you can explain to them this is what's going on.  The G movie they can just pick it up themselves.
Speaker 1: At least it used to be like that.
Speaker 2: Right now--
Speaker 1: I, I think today there's a confusion on the part of parents, you see parents taking their children to things that aren't necessarily the kind of things that they would have been brought to.
Speaker 2: At all.  But that's one of the reasons why because they wasn't able to go you know what I'm saying.  But you gotta understand there's a level of presentation like my brother [McDaniels' adoptive brother, Alford McDaniels] didn't let me come in the basement when I was twelve.  I can't go hang with the sixteen year old guys 'til I'm sixteen and they're nineteen.  Now come on down in the basement to see the black light, see the velvet.  You know with the black light posters and stuff like that.  No Darryl [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] can't come in that basement because not only is that bad for Darryl, that's bad to the people looking from the outside.  "I can't believe they let that little boy go down in that basement with all that drinking and smoking but now you're of age."  See the problem is we're giving kids who are nine and ten what they should wait to get at sixteen or eighteen.
Speaker 1: I know there was a turning point and I don't know if you have an artist or group of artists you would say you know made really made manifest this negative image of hip hop.  I remember Ice-T on 'The Phil Donahue Show'--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --telling Phil Donahue that he calls women whores because some of them are. That's what he said--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know and he had a record called 'Cop Killer'--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and what is it you know N.W.A. [Niggaz Wit Attitudes] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah N.W.A.
Speaker 1: --then you get like 2 Live Crew--
Speaker 2: Right.  Well--
Speaker 1: --and who had real R rated, X rated guys you know and you got that but you also have at the same time you have like the Stop the Violence video ['Self Destruction'] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of course, of course.
Speaker 1: --and everybody get together.  Big Daddy Kane and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, what's missing now is that balance.  You know what's missing now is that balance of okay put it like this, if you make a record about a gun, this is not about censorship and freedom of speech or anything like that, this is about genocide.  If you make a record about a gun, the very next record should be a record about not using a gun, that's the missing thing.
Story_ID: 521134
Speaker 1: If you make a record about strip clubs and, and prostitutes, there should be a record about Aunt Ma- Ma- my mother and Aunt Mabel who don't strip.  Everybody don't go to strip clubs, everybody not in gangs, everybody don't shoot and kill, everybody don't sell drugs, everybody don't even take drugs.  I remember when Chuck D told me, "I don't--I never got high a day in my life."  I was not naive. I was like how come you rap so depth because I thought you needed to smoke some weed and drink some you know what I'm saying you drink some liquor and smoke some weed 'cause you see all the rappers smoking weed and this and that or all the rappers tattooed.  See but not in this continual image will have an effect on the viewer.  We all learn by repetition, teachers know this, instructors know this.  We all learn by repetition so the problem now is this, N.W.A. [Niggaz Wit Attitudes] was necessary we just didn't need fifty N.W.A.'s.  Fifty N.W.A.'s came into fruition because the record company saw that N.W.A. was controversial and shocking but they also sold records.  So when the guy came and said, "I got a record like De La Soul," the label said no.  "That's good that you're creative and you're very oh my god you're very and you're talented but could you be more like N.W.A.?"  Sell records.  So it should be an N.W.A. and there should be a group that's not doing what N.W.A. is doing presented at the same time.  Now whatever if, if the strip club records is making money so all the strip club records are being played on the radio.
Speaker 2: Is it that commercialization of this music (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah the commerc--
Speaker 2: --has that been a downfall?
Speaker 1: Yes right that's a great tip.  The commercialization of any artistic forum will be deluded and polluted I don't care what it is.  That's the problem.  We as people need to take control and what I mean by that is it's so many negative records playing, we need to protest at those radio stations.  If we make their lives miserable, they're gonna change that playlist.  But we just sit back and think nothing of it.  What kills me is all the shootings that is going on in America currently, one young lady said it's wrong when a white cop shoots a black person, but when a black shoots a black person, that's just the way it is.  See hip hop wouldn't never let concept get out there no.  It's worse when a black person shoots a black person.  That's what we need to stop first so that when the white cop does that, he is gone.  See no excuse we don't do this to ourselves.  Like if that--but see it's different now and that's crazy.  That's just the way that so now all the negative rap--there's negative like I said in the dirt poor ghetto there's something good but nobody's talking about it.  So now gangbanging, shooting, drug dealing and whores ah that's just the way it's been.  It's been like that forever though, but our music and our art is not reflecting on the commercial level all of this other stuff that could change the perception of anybody wanting to go join a gang, shoot a gun or mess with a whore.  But there's so many strip club records out.  It becomes--I learned this in social studies, social norms, negativity has become a social norms.  Hip hop was created to defeat and destroy those perceptions of those false social norms.  Hip hop using negativity and disrespect as a false sense of power.
Story_ID: 521135
Speaker 1: The most powerful thing, I remember when we was in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]--no we was in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] we was in Vegas for Tupac's--we was in Vegas the night Tupac got shot.  We actually got hired by Suge Knight to perform at the after party that Tupac and Suge and everybody, all the Death Row [Death Row Records] was gonna be in.  Run-DMC was the hired entertainment in Vegas the night Tupac got shot and killed.  The only reason we didn't--Pac and Suge was coming to pick us from the hotel, but the only reason that I'm laughing and the only reason we didn't get in that car with them, our manager Erik [Erik Blamoville] who's here with me now was like, "Suge y'all go ahead to the fight, we'll meet y'all at the club," 'cause it took Jay [Jam Master Jay] forever to get dressed.  (Laughter) He was like a girl in the mirror.  "What y'all think about this."  "Yo Jay let's get--."  "Nah, nah let me check."  He was contin- so we was running late so we said, "Yo we'll meet y'all at the--," what's his name you know what I'm saying but when we had got to Vegas and this is when Death Row was Death Row.  It was one of the dudes, I believe it was Mel-Man from Dr. Dre's camp 'cause Dr. Dre had his clique of writers, D.O.C. [The D.O.C.] and Mel-Man and all of them and I think it was Mel-Man who said this, oh can I curse?  I can curse 'cause I want to quote him.  Mel-Man came, it was me Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] and Jay standing there and Mel-Man.  Now they from L.A. gangbanging, Crip, Blood you know what I'm saying, Mel-Man said this, "Run-DMC is the only motherfucking group that can come play the motherfucking college scene for the motherfucking two motherfucking hours and rock the motherfucking house and not motherfucking curse once, that's gangster," and the whole crew was like, "Hell yeah."  He says, "How in the fucking hell can this motherfucker," he's pointing at me, "DMC [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] walk out there on stage, go, 'One two, one two, mic check, one two, one two, mic check,' look at the crowd"--
Story_ID: 521136
Speaker 1: So I got to, "Not curse motherfucking once," I gotta do the other part that he [Mel-Man] said.  That's true, no true story.  He said that: "Motherfucking Run DM- [Run-DMC] motherfu- and not curse motherfucking once, that's gangsta" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I believe you (unclear)--
Speaker 1: And they all said, yo, like that shit is crazy.  Like that's power.  That's very inspirational to these gangsta motherfuckers from the street.
Speaker 2: Are we rolling?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Yes.
Speaker 2: So after that he was like and, "Not motherfucking curse once, that's gangsta," ah.  And the whole posse it was a lot of them was like yeah, and then he said, "How can this motherfucker right here DMC [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] walk up on stage and go, 'Mic check one two,' and then walk to the other mic, 'Check one two,' then look at a crowd of forty thousand people, say, 'Can I have your attention please,' and without saying one word, fold his arm in a B boys stance and they all lose it."  He was like, "That's power."  So that's what we showed.  The same way somebody can rap about, "I'm cooking up rocks in the kitchen and I run my neighborhood is this and that," with that attitude and enthusiasm and braggadocio is the same way that I stepped on stage at Live Aid all the people get does something to them.  Like I said earlier the dude was like, "Yo DMC just for you saying it I got a GED [General Educational Development]," but then he went further on.  This was on a radio station.  He said, "Man DMC man I had the Adidas, I had the Mercedes-Benz, I was selling weed, I had guns, I had my Kangol, I had my Godfather hat, I had my big gold chain, I had my Gazelle, my glasses and all that, had my Adidas in every flavor but here comes DMC powerfully rapping about the things that he did, saying that school was cool."  He said, "I realize I was lacking something so I went and got a GED."  But then he said it don't end there, "With my GED 'cause now I got a GED, I was able to take courses at the local community college."  He said, "When I walked in them college doors, I saw a whole world of possibility I did not know existed."  He said, "Right now I'm in the $3 million house with four whips outside, cars and I'm a lawyer."  He said, "That's hip hop."  So for us completely saying, "Be cool, go to school, don't mess with drugs and thugs and you'll be cool."  Like hip hop never said you're wrong for selling drugs, we didn't point our fingers, we said here's the drug dealers I just did five years in prison this and that but when I got out or while I was in in jail, I discovered the power of reading, I discovered education and this and that.  That's what's missing from us right now.  And let's go back before Run-DMC, Run-DMC just personified what the rappers who had less than us was hoping for you know what I'm saying.  I always get kids that say, "Mr. DMC with all due respect, y'all was very materialistic."  I said, "Yeah, first of all, 'Rappers Delight,' "I got bodyguards, I got two big cars but definitely ain't the whack, I got a Lincoln Continental and a sun roof Cadillac.  After school I take a dip in the pool which is really wall to wall, I got a color TV so I can see the next--," we rapped about stuff we wanted to but we spoke it but now the rappers everything I just said the rappers got, mansions, pools this and that but what are they giving us?  What are they giving us?  See we never--we got it and we never gave up the hope.  My record 'Adidas' ['My Adidas'] wasn't about me.  "I got more money than y'all and more sneakers than y'all."  I stepped on stage at Live Aid "I went to St. John's University [Queens, New York]," don't judge the book by its cover.

Speaker 1: So we always at every level said now we made it here, now we're a billion dollar industry.  It's all rap really is now.  People are just getting money.  Imagine that--the money's power.  We got everything that we rapped about now we at a stand nobody's moving forward 'cause they all scared to compromised their street cred.  Street cred is not about being tough, it's about being effective in bringing change. So when you sell drugs in your neighborhood, you getting money but your neighborhood is going down, you know what I'm saying.  When you do it legit-ly your neighborhood goes up 'cause now it can appoint people to do the same thing that you're doing so hip hop always had like one of the greatest rap records ever or one of the greatest so-called gangsta rap records like I hate labeling stuff you know what I'm saying.  I think Talib Kweli or, or Q-Tip or one of them got mad.  I'm not a backpack rappers.  I'm a rapper.  I'm not a conscious rapper.  I'm a rapper that made a record about conscious stuff.  But we just rappers you know what I'm saying.  You don't label it the gangsta rap but one of the greatest so-called gangsta rap records for example ever is 'Mind Playing Tricks On Me' by the Geto Boys.  Because Scarface said, "At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn, Lord I'm in jail," oh he was looking.  No drug dealer wants to sell drugs.  They do it because they think that's their only alternative.  Their story was I'm so paranoid I almost killed three ladies in Popeyes [Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen] because the car was following him.  He pulls over, they were just three ladies going Bushwick Bill was so drugged out the thought he was fighting somebody on Halloween and realized he was fighting the ground.  So 'My Mind's Playing Tricks On Me' but his record, the best so called gangsta rap records tell the story and importantly because you don't have to do it but your responsibility to our culture says, "But you're shorty I went to jail for five years and I shot, I sold drugs and I gangbanged.  But now I'm rapping shorty you don't gotta do that."  Shorty will listen to you.  But now you got a lot of dudes that don't now.  Some of the dudes their friends did it but they didn't do that you know what I'm saying and the real gangsta--when I go to visit penitentiaries and I go to visit jails and people incarcerated, a lot of dudes say this to me, "I'm so happy for hip hop man it came when I was--it didn't save me, but it saved my little brother and sisters by what y'all said to them.  They needed to hear that.  They needed to hear what I did shouldn't be that way of their life.  Just something that happened to me but you guys because of you my sister says 'I'm going to Howard University [Washington, D.C.],' because of you my sister said.  I'm, my, my brother said, 'I'm, I'm a succeed I'm a be the first one in my family to go to college.'"  Those are aspirations that bring, that bring transformation so right now okay we this big industry but what's that, we don't let--the government can't do it, the next president can't do it.  We can do it and Run-DMC--I mean rap music, hip hop showed it but now we got everything we hoped for and nothing's changing.  When hip hop made all the changes that we see within our rap as possible, they all forgot about that.  So Run-DMC knew we had to make--you know Run-DMC we made fun records but we also made sure that we made a record like hard times, spread it but we just didn't bore you with the dull dark stuff.  We rapped about happy, "Christmas time in Hollis, Queens ['Christmas in Hollis']," you know what I'm saying.  "Son of Byford, brother of Al" ['Son of Byford'], rhymes you know what I'm saying.  I go to school this and that.  All of that is part of the plan right now and that's only because Flash [Grandmaster Flash], Bam [Afrika Bambaataa], Zulu Nation, Treacherous Three, they made us realize this is how we succeed.

Speaker 1: The reason why I wasn't afraid to say, "I'm DMC [HistoryMaker Darryl "DMC" McDaniels] in the place to be I go to St. John-," I wasn't the first person to rhyme about school.  The reason I did it is because the rapper Kool Moe Dee [HistoryMaker Mohandas "Kool Moe Dee" DeWese].  Most people know Kool Moe Dee from his infamous battle with LL Cool J in the '90s [1990s].  'How Ya Like Me Now,' and LL making 'I'm Gonna Knock You Out' [sic. 'Mama Said Knock You Out'], but Kool Moe Dee he did something that changed my life.  He had this record called, it was 1982 right before we put our first single out, he had this record called 'Yes We Can' ['Yes We Can Can'] and it was a sample of The Pointer Sisters, "I know we can make it, I know that we can, I know darn well that we could work it out, yes we can, can, yes we can, can, come on," so the record went (musical beats), you know how funky that record was?  So they sampled The Pointer Sisters 'Yes We Can Can' and if people remember what was Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] campaign phrase (Simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes we can.
Speaker 1: I was in, I was in Tokyo [Japan] overseas when Obama first won and everybody jumped up awe this and that so I'm sitting in the room and I'm nonchalantly looking like and everybody's noticing DMC act like he's unphased.  Now I never thought I'd see a black president in my life.  I'm like oh my god this is too good to be real.  I was like is this real? Did I just die somewhere and this is all a dream or whatever?  So I'm sitting there so that was cool this and that but everybody was like losing it.  So I'm sitting there all nonchalantly and I think one of the journalist, Asian journalist, Japanese journalist said to me, "DMC this is huge you know what do you think about that?"  And now I was talking from my hip hop realm which they totally can't get.  I was talking from the hip and I just nonchalantly and innocently said, "Oh Obama don't impress me."  And when I said that, everybody stopped, you can hear a pin drop.  And I said, "Obama don't impress me."  Everybody in the room looking at me like what the?  I said, "Hold up let me explain myself.  Prior to Obama doing what he did, in 1982 Kool Moe Dee from the Treacherous Three along with his group did this record called 'Yes We Can Can' and all of y'all in this room need to go listen to that.  See y'all getting this now, Obama is the personification of something that was prophesized by my favorite emcee from the Bronx [New York] and Harlem [New York, New York] many moons ago," and on this record, the record starts like this, "Evil destruction, tax deduction, price inflation, rocks the nation and unemployment is on the rise, it's hard to find a compromise and if the last light this for long enough time, it won't lead to nothing but a higher level of crime so we say--," and then they go into talking about the conditions in New York City [New York, New York] at that time which if you listen to that record from '82 [1982] it's exactly what's going on right now.  But after they laid out the facts, there comes a part in every record where you know where Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] would rhyme alone and I would rhyme alone so it comes a part for the emcees to rhyme alone and Kool Moe Dee did this which inspired me to say when I get my chance I gotta do the same thing that's why I wasn't afraid to do my DMC rhyme but Kool Moe Dee said these words, he said this and this is very, very powerful.  He said, "Once a nobody from the neighborhood I took a hop to the top because I knew that I would, excel over the rest because I make progress.  I don't consider it luck because I'm not blessed."  He said, "I got my life all together, love the way that I live, go to school really cool and I think positive."  Then he said this, "It's all right to have fun, lots of pleasure and joy but it's the brain that separates the men from the boys." Look at hip hop right now, we having fun and we got money but he said it's the brain, I had to pull my needle back because it wasn't digital then.  I pulled my needle back I said Kool Moe Dee from the Bronx who has way less than me I'm in Queens [New York], I went to St. John's University [Queens, New York] this and that and then I discovered Kool Moe Dee was in college at the time he did that record.  But he said, "It's all right to have fun, lots of pleasures and joys but it's the brain that separates the men from the boys," and he was a boy who with man mentality.  So that's what we missing right now our rappers saying yes I'm from 5th [Avenue] and 9th [Avenue] the worse place in the world but school is cool.  We shouldn't shoot each other.  Here's what we can do to make it better.  When you get that big paycheck come and pl- we're missing that.  Right now it's like I got mines, you got yours and we ain't going nowhere.  Hip hop was created to motivate us to go that next level.
