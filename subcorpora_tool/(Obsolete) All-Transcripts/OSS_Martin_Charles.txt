 Gill. Today is April 1, 2009. I   m visiting with Dr.  Charles Martin in his home here in Perry, Oklahoma. This interview is  for Oklahoma State through the O-STATE Stories project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Dr. Martin, thank you for  taking time to meet with us today.  You   re welcome.  I know you   ve got some wonderful stories of your father and Oklahoma  State University, but I wanted to back up and ask you to tell a little bit  about where you grew up. It was in Stillwater I guess, but could you tell  us a little bit about your early life, about your family?  Yes. I was born in Vinita, Oklahoma where my father, A.O., was the  superintendent of schools. We moved to Stillwater in 1930. I entered the  first grade that year and completed all of my common school and high  school at Stillwater High School. Graduated in 1941.  Can you tell a little bit about the values that you learned from your  family and childhood experiences that molded and influenced your life?  Well, the story would be one of a unit I think; the family was a strong  unit. Dad worked at the college and he was the bread winner. Mother  never worked outside of the home in Stillwater. We grew up during the  thirties which was a hard time but we didn   t seem to suffer any or didn   t  have any handicap that we knew of. The family was a religious family.  We belonged to the Baptist church and we went to church together. We  had a good family.  Dr. Martin, you were talking about your mother. I understand, also, that  you rented out maybe a home next to you.  5  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  My mother did have a secondary income, because she did take care of  several college student generations that roomed at our house and lived in  an apartment that was attached to the garage. So my mother  supplemented the income that Father had.  What about your siblings? Now you were the oldest as I understand?  I was the oldest. There were three siblings, including me. My sister  Mary Elizabeth was born in 1926 at Vinita and my brother James was  born in 1927 at Vinita. So all three of us were born at Vinita where Dad  was superintendent of schools.  You lived there in Stillwater, and your dad worked at the college. Was  there any college option for you other than Oklahoma A M/Oklahoma  State?  Never. All the Stillwater high school students in that day and time aimed  to go to college. Yes we did. That   s what most of us did. We were  seeking a higher education; we simply finished our high school  graduation and then enrolled at Oklahoma A M.  Kind of like the thirteenth grade, just moved right up. What year did you  enroll at Oklahoma State?  In the fall, September of 1941.  That was an interesting fall in the history of the United States.  Yes, I remember the first semester. Now, I would say that I was not of  legal age at that time. I was seventeen. I turned eighteen May 6, 1942,  and this influenced some of those decisions of service in the Army and  so forth. I enlisted in Reserve Corps as soon as I was eighteen.  So you spent the first year then at A M/Oklahoma State. Then did you  go into the military then after that first year?  Yes, then of course December 7,  1941  changed everything and we all  began to get the war fever and ROTC was very important to us, very  important.  Well, could we maybe pause and ask a little bit about what you  remember about the campus in the fall of 1941? What was it like?  The first thing   my reaction as I began to think back was the enormous  size. I looked up the graduating class from Stillwater High School: 159.  And that   s just the senior class. Now the total student body at Stillwater  6  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  High School would be probably 500-600. Now let   s multiply that by  twenty (laughs) and you can see that a senior in high school going to  OSU or to Oklahoma A M, you are immediately a small fish in a big  pool. You   ve got to adjust to the size and the specialized educational  opportunities, the different departments which are now called colleges of  the University, but they were departments then. You had to decide which  department or college you were going to enroll in at Oklahoma A M.  So the first fork in the road was engineering, or arts and sciences or  education. I chose arts and sciences.  Do you remember where your classes were held? What buildings were  your classes in?  Yes, the chemistry building, and selecting a major then within a major  field of study, within the department, I chose chemistry. The chemistry  building, I well remember the lab where all the near explosions occur  and we had our lab studies. And then our lecture, of course, was there  too. Dr. Burrows was our professor and he gave the lecture to a group of  a couple of hundred freshmen or more. But the lab was very individual.  You had to do your lab experiments down in the basement of the  chemistry building which now, I believe, is the journalism building at  OSU. We had some classes in the old Williams Hall building that we  had   it   s like the English course there, we had social studies, and B.B.  Chapman was our professor. I remember the old library which is now  where the Alumni Center is. Of course, Old Central   s still there. Now I  hope it always will be. I want it to be there and keep fixing it up until it   s  there forever, you know.  Did you have some favorite places on campus? Favorite hangouts?  Well, the campus corner then was kind of at Swim   s which is about  where Eskimo Joe   s is now, on the way. We would go in there for a  Coke or ice cream cone or something. But the Strip wasn   t the Strip  then. We   re talking now sixty-eight years ago right now for going back.  But it wasn   t a university then, it was a college. It was called Oklahoma  A M College, but it was something that high school seniors dreamed  about.  What do you remember about some of your professors or  administrators? You mentioned B.B. Chapman who taught Oklahoma  History and     B.B. Chapman. I remember Colonel Yost was the professor of military  science and tactics. He was a    full chicken colonel     as  we called it.  ROTC was required; every freshman and sophomore  male  had to take  ROTC in that day and age. We had to go get a uniform fit for us  with   7  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Captain McDonald on the west end of the old gymnasium. So, ROTC,  considering in December   considering the war was going on and we  were just not in it yet, everybody was pretty intent on ROTC. And let   s  see, the chemistry professor, Dr. Burrows. I gave you the social studies;  one of the three, of course, was B.B. Chapman. Let   s see, who were  some of the others? George Bullock, I want to mention George Bullock  was the secretary of the Y. He was important to us. YMCA Hut was  there.  Was the Y-Hut on campus?  Yeah, the Y-Hut was on campus. Wooden framed building and then they  sold some brews and would heat up some grub and so forth. It was about  where the parking lot is on the north end of the Student Union now is  about where that was. But then the big smoke stacks   the power plant  was right there and that hundred foot tall smoke stack. Right across the  street, south of the power plant was the O   Collegian building. My  freshman year I carried the O   Collegian paper and got well acquainted  with that building, two ways. One because that   s where the Oklahoma  A M magazine was produced too and so that   s where we worked and  helped my father when he was putting out the Oklahoma A M college  magazine.  You talked about working at the O   Colly. Could you tell us a little bit  about some of your student organizations, leadership activities you were  engaged in?  Yes, we were happy to be selected for Phi Beta Sigma. That was a  definite honor, honorary freshman. A fraternity for scholarship entirely.  Scholarship was the whole thing. Phi Beta Sigma and then I did join an  honorary pre-med fraternity, Alpha Pi Mu. I   ve forgotten who the  sponsor was. I well remember my old advisor, Dr. Harry Orr. I should  mention him as the pre-med advisor. We were in student medicine  before we ever got into the Army but never dreamed it would unfold the  way it did with the war being the thing that developed.  You mentioned  you were  a strong Baptist family and attended the  Baptist church. Were you ever in Dr. Bennett   s Sunday school class?  No, I was too young. (Laughs) Although, I heard him once or twice. He  had a class of college students, college men. And why wasn   t I in it, I   m  trying to think real fast. My thought is that he was   I don   t know  exactly why I wasn   t a regular member of his class.  Now you weren   t playing hooky were you? (Laughs)  8  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Maybe I was teaching a Sunday school class. I think maybe I was  teaching a Sunday school class and not free. I remember who my  Sunday school teacher was and that was his son, the attorney. Phil, I  think, was my Sunday school teacher, see, and my first reaction I was  too young for. It doesn   t sound quite right in the sequence of events. But  Phil Bennett   he had three or four sons, you know. Let   s see. Henry Jr.,  I think Tom was the obstetrician/gynecologist; Phil Bennett was the  attorney I think. Tom was a twin of Liberty. Tom and Liberty   Liberty  was a girl. Henry Bennett was the patron saint of OSU.  Did you have a personal relationship with Dr. Bennett? Did you know  him through your father maybe more than as you would just as a  student?  I saw him. That   s just it. I don   t recall a personal conversation between  him and me. No, I don   t.  Do you have a favorite student memory, a highlight of your student days  on campus?  I was old enough to carry a paddle and wear a beanie. (Laughter) Yeah, I  remember the freshman orientation course. There was an orientation  course. There was another type of orientation which   well, it wasn   t  hazing. But it was a verbal or visual hazing.  You wore the freshman beanie?  Yeah, you had to wear the beanie and you   well, I got to think about  living in Stillwater and growing up in Stillwater and Theta Pond and the  tug-of-wars that I used to go up and watch. The freshman class would  challenge the sophomore class, and they had this big rope. They   d  stretch it clear across Theta Pond. They would pull back and forth, back  and forth. Finally one side would get ahead and pull, and the other  couldn   t keep their feet dry. They lost their pulling power because they  were getting dragged into the lake. Then it all collapsed, and here they  came dragging them clear across Theta Pond. Of course, most of them  let go before that. They saw they were going to lose, whichever side. But  it was an annual event, the tug-of-war across Theta Pond between  freshmen and sophomores.  And the water was not near as clear as it is today was it?  No, it was muddy. I don   t recall any ducks or geese on it either. It wasn   t  very pretty but     Also, you were saying something earlier about being on the drill team,  9  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  the Army     Yeah, we had a sergeant; I can   t forget that old Master Sergeant Sexton  who was the coach of the ROTC rifle team. It was our good fortune to  be selected to be on that part of the team. We were in the basement of  what was now   it was the old gym then, but now it   s the School of  Architecture. This .22 indoor rifle range was a place that we did hang  out because we could practice anytime we wanted to there. So, it was a  favorite place. We learned to shoot in the prone position, the sitting  position, the kneeling position and the upright standing position. And we  never had been acquainted with hunting or firearm usage. This was  obviously a thrill for us to participate and to go out for the ROTC rifle  team, and I want to certainly give credit to Sergeant Sexton. I think  Lafayette Sexton. It suddenly dawned on me. He was about a thirty year  veteran and too old to serve the war actively, but they made him coach  and was part of the ROTC unit there at Stillwater and we shot on that  team with Tom Bennett. Tom Bennett was another son of Henry  Bennett, Dr. Henry Bennett. Tom was on the team a year or two ahead  of me, but I enjoyed making acquaintances with Tom Bennett.  Well, now you were part of the old firehouse gang?  Yes.  Can you tell us a little bit about that?  The ROTC   now this was during the war. The ROTC   by accelerating  all the educational programs whereby the schools all over the country  went to 12-month schools, that   s why ROTC was available in the  summer of 1942. And so I took it in the summer. We took ROTC in the  summer. Then my fourth semester would be the fall of    42. So, that  made me eligible to go into the advanced ROTC program which was a  contract that, if we successfully completed it, we would be a second  lieutenant of infantry. So we were asked to join   we enlisted   we did.  We enlisted in the Reserve Corps.    Stay in school,    is what they told us.  Of course, we wanted to stay in school as long as we could. So, we  stayed this one extra semester, but it was enough to qualify us to go to  Officer Candidate School in Fort Benning, Georgia. But before that we  had to be trained in basic infantry training for the 17-week cycle at  Camp Roberts, California, the summer of    43.  By the time we got ready to go to OCS (Officer Candidate School) in  Fort Benning, the pipeline  was  completely full of candidates, and they  didn   t have any place to send us after infantry training. So they said they  would send us back on active duty to your home campus. We came back  then in August or September of    43 and were enrolled in the rest of     10  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  well, they said,    We don   t have a prescribed course. We   ll give you pre-engineering.     Well, I said,    I would like to go to medical school can I  take       I was lacking organic chemistry and I had to take a biological  science, a botany course I think, and one other to meet the minimum  credit hour requirement to get into medical school. And of course  medical students were always, I would like to say, hard to find in those  days because everybody was in the war, you know. But by qualifying  while we were waiting and being quartered at the campus, which the  quarters they found for us was the second floor or the third floor of the  campus firehouse. So we had a bunch of ROTC students there for about  two semesters nearly. I did get a letter of acceptance to the medical  school and left the group I had been with all that time. Left the group,  really, for an interlude time to Borden General Hospital down in  Chickasha, Oklahoma, and was a ward attendant waiting for the  September class of    44 of the University of Oklahoma Medical School to  start. And that   s the circuitous route that I took to get into medical  school. It just happened that way due to the ASTP (Army Specialized  Training Program) programs and all the special programs they were  having. So actually the first two years of medical school, I was on active  duty. All the male students were on active duty with the B12 Navy or  ASTP Army program at the medical school campus.  So you finished in actual World War II in medical school?  Yeah in    48. My graduation from medical school would be four years  later in    48. We decelerated in the summer of    46. So we had about a  five month break and I worked for Stillwater Hospital as a ward  attendant at that time, John Jacobs in the day time and I worked the  twelve hours at night.  So then when you got your degree, then were you required to serve in  the armed services then for a while?  Yes, afterwards, of course. We had a moral persuasion campaign by  Secretary of Defense  James  Forestall and we reenlisted for Korea.  So, Dr. Martin, actually then when the war was over you got discharged  from the military but then completed your medical school.  That   s right. The B12 students were kept on reserve status and then  when Korea came along, why, the Navy was able to recall their reserves,  but the Army didn   t have the foresight   or we were completely  discharged in 1946. I guess it was    46. So I completed medical school  under the GI Bill and then graduated from medical school in 1948.  What happened those four years in between?  11  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  What happened is I interned at the University of Wisconsin General  Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin, where I met a school teacher from  Saginaw, Michigan. It was a long distance courtship and  correspondence. We were engaged to be married   let   s see the  engagement was at Christmas in 1948. And we were married, then, on  July 2, 1949.  And this girl from Saginaw was named Margie?  Margie. Marjorie Ann Billmeier. We took our honeymoon on the way  home from Michigan. She was from Saginaw and we drove from  Saginaw to Oklahoma City where I had another year of hospital training.  Residency.  My residency at the old Wesley Hospital. That   s where our first child  was born; Mary Ann was born in June of 1950. If you recall that date,  that   s the date that Korea started. That   s when the North came down to  the South somewhere   it was in June of 1950. We decided we   d try to  start a practice, but this service angle was hanging over our head. We  decided to get it out of our way so we didn   t have to leave after we   d  started up our practice, and leave it and come back and forth. So we  looked around and decided the best decision would be to go ahead. And  we were under some pressure from the Department of Defense by the  way, all this moral persuasion, which meant,    We   ve given you your  medical education, we   ve paid for it, now we need you.    We could  either be drafted or volunteered. That was the instruction. So we  volunteered. When we were up in Wisconsin at Camp McCoy, about  ninety days or so before we began to get our orders to go to Korea, it  was over Christmas that we came back to Oklahoma for a real quick  reunion and so the grandparents could see Mary Ann, and then I went to  Korea. I think I got there January 12, 1951. Stayed most of the year in  Korea, got home in October or November. Then had a few more months  to serve, and my service was ended at Fort Hood, Texas  at  the women  and children   s clinic which was some pediatric experience which was  very useful to me. Very useful, and I   m grateful for all the Army and the  federal government   s service, what they   ve done for me too.  So we moved to Perry then. I guess we should  tell  how we got to  Perry. Of course, our decision hadn   t been made to come to Perry until  after I got out of the Army the second time. We found a vacancy. A  physician had just left and there was an opening, so to speak, and it was  close to Stillwater, and the new hospital was just built. It was open  eighteen months before we got here so we had a new hospital. We felt  like Perry would be our place, and here we   ve been for fifty-five years.  12  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  That was in 1952?  1952.  And then you retired in what year?  Let   s see. My private office closed in 1991. It was thirty-eight years of  active office   medical practice and hospital practice. I was still licensed  and I had ten more years of medical directorship of the long term care  facility, the nursing homes in Perry. If I count the two years in the Army,  that makes fifty years.  Wow. A lot of changes in medicine.  Yeah. Thirty-eight in office work and then ten in long term care. That   s  forty-eight. And then two in the Army. That   s fifty years of licensed  practice.  Can you verify a story that I heard? Someone said here recently to me  that Dr. Martin was one of the last physicians in this area to do house  calls.  (Laughs) We made a lot of them; we made a lot of them. I suppose that   s  probably true that Perry is a rural agriculture town, and we did make a  lot of house calls. I don   t know when the last one was but I would still  make it in the    80s I think. 1980-something.  I think we talked earlier about your family life here. But all your kids  grew up, then, here in Perry?  That   s right. All of our children are Perry graduates through a total of  twelve years right here in Perry.  Their names are?  Let   s see our oldest is Mary Ann, and then Kathryn Elyse, and then  David Charles and then Kenneth John. They all seem to be doing well  and are very successful. Of course, I would say about the medical  practice, I happened to be in a situation where the new hospital was  changing from house deliveries of babies to hospital deliveries of babies.  So we came in a time where medicine in our community was  modernizing and the obstetrical angle or delivery of babies really made  it a family practice   general practice physician. I   m thinking the highest  point in my professional career would be the delivery of the identical  triplet boys, the Clark triplets, in 1964. This was before all the  sonograms and the x-ray   well, we had x-rays but we could already tell  13  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  that there was going to be two. But I have to admit that we missed the  third one.  I   d like to turn the discussion to talk about your father Archie O.,  sometimes known as A.O. Martin.  Yes, Archie, A.O. Martin, yes. Because, really, let me confess that I  wouldn   t be a physician if he wouldn   t have  given me  the inspiration  to apply. I was in Camp Roberts, California, when he somehow had the  foresight to get a conditional letter of acceptance. If I   m not mistaken  now   no, I know that   s true. He got a conditional letter if I would meet  the minimal requirements. I guess he maybe understood or he knew that  I would be coming back to Oklahoma A M for a semester. I lacked  eight hours or ten hours of college credits to meet the minimum   requirements  which were low. Sixty credit hours were all you had to  have to get to medical school. Of course, there were no medical students.  A lot of them were in the Army. But the government felt like they  wanted to keep the medical schools going, and I was a pre-med student  anyways. He knew I had that inspiration, I guess. I think maybe that  came from having my appendix out when I was a senior in high school.  And Dr. Roberts and Dr. Fry and so forth in Stillwater may have, to an  impressionable senior in high school, made so much difference that I  enrolled that fall.  It must have been pretty bad because Dr. Harry Orr was the pre-med  advisor. He was a professor of physiology. I was an Alpha Phi Mu. So, I  feel like I was pointed to be pre-med but I needed a little help, and A.O.  gave it to me. He was the one who opened the door so I could fulfill that  dream. I credit him with being on top of the situation and kind of  understanding the dynamics of the age and time that we were in and  how   of course, I had to do the work and study. I mean, I took the  organic chemistry and all the science courses during that quick brief  firehouse gang. Got special permission here but they were happy for me  to do it. But A.O., of course, set an awful high standard for himself. He  was about twenty-eight years old when he finally got his bachelor   s  degree at Stillwater.  Charles, can I ask you to kind of back up a little bit? What community  did he grow up in?   He was born in Louisburg, Kansas, in Miami County, on March 16,  1891, but in 1893 his family moved to Oklahoma.  So he grew up in  Blaine County  in a  farm family. He had to take a year at a time and his  first year  at Oklahoma A M was 1913 , and A.O. grew up on a farm  and he and his brother alternated. They   d help on the farm for a year and  then they would go to college for a year. Now we   re talking about prior  14  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  to World War I.  Was it a typical large farm family?  Yes.  Did he have several brothers and sisters?  There was Oliver and Leroy and Esther and Edward Martin. So there  were four children.  So your father grew up in Blaine County. Close to what city?  Watonga.  Close to Watonga. So you   re telling the story about as he got older,  though, he wanted to go to college but then he and his brother  alternated.  That   s right. They were great on education. My goodness, Watonga  education, Watonga schools. And then for them to go to university, they  even moved to Stillwater. My Grandmother and Grandfather Martin, that  would be A.O.   s parents, moved to Stillwater so they would have access,  I think, to Oklahoma A M. That was  how  I remember the story. That  was the reason they moved to 706 Jefferson, which was kind of across  the street from 631 Jefferson where A.O. built.  A.O. stayed on the farm in Watonga and farmed, and then A.O.   s mother  and father then actually came to Stillwater, is that correct?  I believe that   s right. He served in World War I in the Navy, though, so  that was interrupted.  Did  your father  graduate from high school?   No.  Mother graduated from Mangum.  A.O. did not graduate from  high school.   A.O. and his brother   one continued to work on the farm for a year  while the other went to school.  Yes.  I understand he grew up in rural Blaine County.  That   s right.  15  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Went to a small eight-grade school. Then after he finished the eighth-grade   in 1905 , then he actually attended a year or two of normal  school. Then he got a teaching certificate to teach what we   ll call grade  school, the old rural one through eighth grade, is that right?  That   s right.  And then as he was juggling his teaching grade school, then he was also  going back and started in 1913 the first enrollment in preparatory at  A M which was preparing him for college. So he really wasn   t a  college student.  That   s right.  So then he finished his preparatory training, which I guess would be  equivalent to getting his high school degree, and then actually started  into college courses.  That   s right. I want to say it was an agrarian revolution. He was a  farmer, but he wanted to be educated and he wanted to get into  education. And he taught. He liked teaching and he was a great teacher  all his life.  Now, during this time, he would have to interrupt some college  coursework to go back and work on the farm.  Get some money, yeah.  Get some money, go to school, come back.  Come back and get an education. Then here came World War I, and he  had a period of active duty with the United States Navy. And I  understand from my deceased brother, Jamie,  he  told me about some of  his physical prowess. I didn   t know he was able to climb a rope with his  hands, like this, fifty feet up or something like that. And he won the  contest, see, and he was   I think the picture we have shows him as a  Shore Police. That   s an MP. Military Police was the Army. SP was the  Shore Police and Shore Police were to keep the rowdy sailors in line.  Pretty tough guy.  Yeah, he wasn   t that type to me at all. I was surprised to learn that he  had some physical prowess.  Now he graduated in 1919 from     16  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  From Oklahoma A M.  He was editor of the Orange and Black, the student newspaper which  preceded the O   Colly; he was the editor of the student newspaper.  He was a journalist. Then he had editorials. We have copies of his  editorials. They all plugged the Oklahoma A M.  Do you know of any other activities that he was involved in as a student?   He was in plays. He participated in debate. He was very active in his  fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, until he was very advance in age.   What was his major?  It was education. Then, of course, he went on and got a master   s degree  at Columbia University in New York City.  What year was that, do you recall?  1928.  So he then taught awhile and was a school administrator.  He would go to summer school. All this time he was teaching, and he  was working up in administration and he became superintendent of the  schools at Brinkman, Oklahoma from  1919 to 1922 . That   s where he  met his wife and fellow teacher, my mother.  She was from nearby  Mangum and I think rode the train to school each day.  An educator  marrying an educator. So, education has been our whole theme, then,  through the     Do you remember some of the school systems that he was in? I guess he  was last at Vinita before he came to Stillwater?  That   s right.  Where was he before?  Brinkman. That was the only two that I remember. Well he was at  Weatherford.  So A.O. had a pretty interesting career there for     A.O. was a world   not world traveler but, for that day and age and for  the cars that they had, to cover the state of Oklahoma from the short  17  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  grass country of Greer County, Mangum, Oklahoma, to go up to Vinita,  which is clear up in Craig County, clear up in the Northeastern, the  green country, the wet part of the country was a tremendous change.  But he was a tough guy and he was also in boxing, as I understand.  That   s right. He was physically fit, I think. Of course, he survived until  he was 85, so he was physically fit. Played a lot of golf. And I think he  enjoyed life.  We   ve had some previous conversations off camera but, if I can kind of  repeat it, when he went to Brinkman in Greer County close to Mangum,  he taught there. Then, after that, he went to Walters.  Walters as principal  from 1922 to 1923 .  He was there a couple years and then he went to Vinita, which you  mentioned earlier. He was principal of Vinita  from 1923 to 1924 , then  he became superintendent,  which he served as from 1924 to 1930 .  I think the agreement already was that he was going to become  superintendent, from what I read.  Now, I understand that while he was in Brinkman and Walters, he  helped with the part-time faculty at Southwestern.  Yes, he was interested in higher education. He was interested despite  this common or lower education that the high school and so forth, while  he was already getting some summertime teaching positions at the  university or college level work.  And then, as I understand, he had one summer at Northeastern in  Tahlequah.  Yes, Tahlequah in  1924 .  And then in 1929 I think he was on the summer faculty at A M,  in the  School of Education .  That   s right, that   s right.  Then in between here and in the midst of all this, he worked on his  master   s degree at the University of Columbia in New York, is that  correct?  That   s right.  18  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Got his master   s in 1928. How did he do all of that?  I think, really, the train schedules saved the day. One year, I think I was  a little infant and I took the trip.  It took  four summers of courses to get  a master   s degree. I think he took the train, and Mother raised children at  home.  Do you know some of the story about how he got his position as  Secretary of the Former Student Association, I guess in 1930?  No, I was six years old and, to me, it was just a change to a different  town. And in later years I   ve wondered what the connection was, what  the selection process was, where he became the alumni secretary and I  think there are some changes in the   you   re probably aware of this,  Jerry, changes in the names of the organizations. Former students got  into it rather than alumni. Alumni, I discovered, makes me think of  graduates, actual four-year graduates. But former students include  anybody who took a semester course. Just one semester, you   re a former  student. A lot wider base of ownership of college work if you   re a  former student rather than just an alumni.  I think you   re right, Charlie. As I recall, it was the Oklahoma A M or  OAMC Alumni Association through the twenties, and then I think when  your father took over in the thirties, then they changed the name to  Former Student Association.  Yes, to widen the base and to make Oklahoma A M the land-grant  college of the west.  Well, Dr. Martin, your father was very close to Dr. Bennett, as I  understand.  Yes, they were.  And Dr. Bennett highly valued the Alumni Association. Do you recall  any of their relationships?  Well, several. Several. I remember the Organization of the Red Red  Rose. Now that was a   I don   t remember exactly, but it was a loosely-knit  organization of educators. I think you qualified by being in  education, but it seemed to be a fun organization too. Grand old man and  all that. I don   t know the details of that, but I do know that Dad enjoyed  it a lot, and he and Dr. Bennett were in it together with much of the  faculty of Oklahoma A M. Then another relationship between Dr.  Bennett and A.O. was at the church, too. I think the Baptist church  meant a lot to both of them. It was a common meeting place. But I don   t  19  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  remember any stories of Dad   s that told just what the selection process  was, but he was visible on the scene in higher education by being at  these colleges, Southwestern at Weatherford and Northeastern in  Tahlequah. He was visible on the scene and he was an Oklahoma A M  graduate. And, well, his mother was still living in Stillwater. A  pilgrimage, always. We   d travel from Vinita back to Mangum and see  the other grandma. Of course, we   d stop off and see the grandmother at  Stillwater on the way down. It was a two-day trip. But we   d get as far as  Stillwater, from Vinita to Stillwater, and we   d stay overnight and then  we   d drive on to the southwestern part of the state. My mother   s home  was in Mangum, and we had the other grandmother there. So those are  pleasant memories of long gone days.  Speaking of memories, growing up as a student did you ever help your  dad with any of his alumni activities?  Yes, he wasn   t afraid to ask us to help. It wasn   t a paid job. I don   t recall  him rewarding us with money or anything like that, but we were able to  help him. And I fondly remember the wrapping of the Oklahoma A M  magazine for mailing. My mother, I think I related this before, Jerry, she  made the paste or the glue that we used on the wrapper to   these  wrappers had an address on them. You had to roll the magazine and  wrap it just right and hold it for a little while so that glue would stick,  then put it over in the mail bag. But, yes, this was principally up in the  old O   Collegian building which was just across the street, south from  the old power plant. Of course, in my freshman year of college, where I  would show up to get the   they had the big printing press in there. The  O   Collegian was printed right there. So this was where I would show up  at four or five in the morning to get my papers to deliver the  O   Collegian that day. This was my freshman year in college.  Did you ever help with class reunions, homecoming activities, any of  those things?  No, I don   t recall. I don   t recall any participation with him on any of that  activity.  Do you recall about your father   s Alumni Association responsibilities?  Why, yes, he had a deep desire and I do recall, this being in high school  and junior high, repeated campaigns to make Oklahoma A M College  independent of political influence. That was a crusading effort that he  was in. I recall several defeats before it was passed. But I was only   its  own Board of Regents. But yes, I do recall   and too, his campaign for  the Student Union building, all the efforts that he was a leader in the  effort to develop a Student Union Building.  20  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Do you recall if saving Old Central was a key issue with the alumni at  that time? Did he ever talk about saving Old Central? They were talking  about razing it.  Saving Old Central, yes. In fact, that came after he moved his office out  to the Student Union, I think. There have been several efforts to save  Old Central. And with the repeated effort to be sure and not let Old  Central fall apart.  My understanding is that Dr. Bennett felt strongly about saving Old  Central.  That   s right.  Dr. Bennett wanted to move the Former Student Association offices into  Old Central to save the building. Is that correct in your memory of it?  I suspect that that   s the way it probably happened, but I don   t have any  recollection of his saying that to me or that would be the way the  mechanism could have worked.  Was your father   s office was in Old Central  for awhile ?  Yes, second floor of Old Central was A.O. Martin   s office.  Until the Student Union  was finished in  1950.   Moved to the  Student Union in the early    50s, I guess.  What do you remember about his office, the old president   s office, early  in history?  Old Central was the first building on the Oklahoma A M campus. That  had all the functions of the university, the college. I mean, there was a  lecture hall. I remember a large lecture hall. That was upstairs. Dad   s  office was where the old president   s was, that   s true. The basement was  geology, I thought. Then the second floor had classrooms. And then the  third floor   I guess it was the third floor, counting the basement as the  first floor, why there were three floors.  Now, do you remember in his office there was a little fireplace? I don   t  know if they were still using it back then, but did he have a roll top desk?  What do you remember about the furniture and the equipment? What did  the room look like, do you recall?  I don   t recall. I just don   t recall right now. There was a series of offices.  21  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  The secretary was out front and then there was a second and a third  office. I don   t remember the furniture. There was kind of a lobby area or  a section area and then an inner office. I don   t recall.  In the history of Oklahoma A M, Frank Martin comes up frequently.  Yes.  Any relationship?  No relationship. A.O. and A. Frank. You are right. Yet, they were close  buddies, close friends. And there was a D. Terry Martin. I don   t know  whether you   ve heard of D. Terry Martin. He was in the speech  department. There were no relations between any of those Martins.  Dr. Martin, what were some of the key initiatives under your father   with  the Former Student Association? Of course, you were talking  about an independent governing board for Oklahoma A M/Oklahoma  State University now. It finally came to fruition in the forties, which that  was a big one. Then, I guess, saving Old Central was a big one and  that   s where your dad   s office was. I wanted to ask you, did you  remember something about the key Alumni Association activities at that  time, what they were?  The organization of football events, I guess you   d say, Homecoming.  Actually, the trips away from home. I do remember him setting a  headquarters in Dallas for a game. There were repeated efforts with the  Alumni Association and Dad and his secretary to develop the backing or  enthusiasm of graduates within that area to support the team and the  Alumni Association. So, yes, there were efforts of closely related to the  student body all the time.  He did pursue efforts to stabilize the administration of the college, too. I  mean, I now remember how he would say that negative votes sink us. Or  if you didn   t vote for it, you were against it. You were accounted against  it. And repeated statewide votes on the ballots of elections of trying to  develop an independent Board of Regents for Oklahoma A M. Finally,  successful. But I bet there were four or five tries before it ever  succeeded.  I also understand his county clubs were important at that time. It was  really expanding in Payne County, Tulsa County, Oklahoma County.  Yes, regional organizations    support groups of clubs called the Alumni  Clubs. There was a grassroots effort to develop backing and support for  long term goals and survival. Not just survival but long term nurturing of  22  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Oklahoma A M College. He was instrumental in drumbeating all the  time for support for the Oklahoma A M College. It was a given that all  of his prodigy would go through. And we all did. We all have degrees  from Oklahoma A M College as children of his and he had a degree.  We were all talented, strong alumni supporters.  Do you remember as part of class reunions some of the early graduates?  Like did you ever meet Jessie Thatcher Bost or some of the early  graduates of Oklahoma A M?  I do not remember actually shaking hands or talking to them, no. I don   t  remember the original classes. Those early, early   he didn   t involve us  or I didn   t take the effort to meet them, so no I have no     Of course, they had the annual meeting of the Alumni Association as a  big event, and then  the  Board meetings.  Yes, yes.  Do you remember any of the early leaders, presidents of the Association,  for example, Mr. Drummond, who Drummond Hall was named after?  Well, yes. We had one locally here in Perry, I want to be sure to credit  Glen Yahn. And when I first came to Perry I got a few Aggie football  schedules to start spreading around town, and Glen Yahn said that was  his job. He was the head Aggie in this town. And Glen was always the  number one Aggie in Perry, America.  Well, do you recall having heard a conversation at the time or later after  he retired, how your father felt about the role and importance of alumni  in the university and the role of the Former Student Association? Did he  ever visit with you about that?  He didn   t mention T. Boone Pickens. (Laughter) But obviously A.O. felt  very strongly about loyalty to your education. It wasn   t given to you  without reason that you were expected to pay back. And he, I don   t  recall any   I appreciate T. Boone Pickens and all that he   s done for  OSU, and I didn   t mean any disrespect or anything. But I do think that  the alumni support through the Foundation   now, we haven   t mentioned  the Foundation. I   d like to give credit to the OSU Foundation and what  they have, what that   s developed into in the last twenty-five years. Being  tax supported is just not enough anymore. You have to have the private  donations, and nothing like being grateful for your education. I   m happy  that people do support the Foundation.  I understood and talked to alumni that maybe one of the major  23  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  contributions of the Former Student Association and your father during  that period was to put out the A M Magazine. I guess he had a regular  column that he wrote in the magazine. You talked about mail out and     Yeah, we   d mail those out, but he was the editor. He was everything. He  didn   t print it. I guess it printed at the O   Colly office. But anyway, he  wrote and he was the editor. His multiple editorials definitively  supporting the different efforts of the Board, or the early Board of  Regents, and the issues of the Student Union and all the important  educational issues. He had a long view and the ability to write well and  wrote always in support of Oklahoma A M College.  I understand Dr. Bennett was very supportive of Alumni Association  gifts and financial support to it, as well as the University.  Yes, and probably subsidized by him. I mean, obviously it was some  financial effort to budget wise to produce that, and now I   d like to give  credit to the present administration. It   s a wonderful magazine that we  have now that includes everything. And we read it cover to cover.  Your father, and maybe you as well, was so used to Oklahoma A M.  How did he like the name change to Oklahoma State University?  Never heard him complain. But I don   t know. He never complained  much, anyway. But I never heard him voice enthusiasm for it, either, I   m  thinking. But I don   t recall any change that he felt that was     Your father stepped down in 19        53.  He came in    30 and stepped down in    53. But twenty-three years, which  is the longest of anybody in the Former Student Association/Alumni  Association history tenure, next to Murl Rogers. All this time he was  head of the Former Student Association, most of the time he was also  head of the Placement Bureau, is that right?  That   s right.  What do you remember about that?  Well, it was an auxiliary function, in a way, and most importantly  because it was his love of education and the help of the school system  superintendents in Oklahoma to find adequately trained, certified  teachers within the subject field that they needed. So, yes, that created  maybe more traffic in his office than the alumni business, in a way. But I  24  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  imagine it was fifty-fifty. It was a tremendous effort that they kept track  of graduates in education, particularly teachers.  Well, for a long time, as I understand it,  he played  a role of the  Former Student Association and it became so large it was created as a  separate  entity  and really he was doing two jobs.  He was wearing two hats, yes. He was the secretary of the alumni and he  was Director of the Placement Bureau. So he had two heavy jobs.  When he stepped down from the Former Student Association, he stayed  another two or three years as head of the Placement Bureau, is that  right?  That   s right. His successor Murl Rogers did not do the Placement  Bureau and Dad continued to do that for several years after he stepped  down as the alumni secretary.  Do you recall what year he did retire?   I  think 1958.  So he stayed a couple of years, then, as Director of the Placement  Bureau.  He passed away in    76.  Do you recall what his relationship with Murl Rogers was?  Very close, very close. In fact, they were in the same office. I think they  moved the Placement Bureau to the Student Union, too. I think they  were very close. It was a wonderful relationship.  Can you tell me a little bit about what your dad did after he retired?  He played golf. He played golf, he played golf. He played golf. He could  beat me. I never played golf. I tried once or twice and he always beat me  so I just gave it up. (Laughter)  Oh, mercy.  Well, he grew a garden. He liked to garden. I guess he still had the  farmer in him. And playing golf and gardening and church work. He was  a long-time member of Rotary Club of Stillwater and he wasn   t much on  travel. I don   t think he took a lot of long trips anywhere.  25  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  American Legion, I understand, as well.  Yeah, he was in the American Legion  and  was Post Commander in  Stillwater. He was a Mason. He traveled to see the grandkids.  Dr. Martin, what do you remember most about your dad? I   m sure  several things, but are there one or two things that stood out in your  mind about your father?  Authentic. (Laughs) Authentic, honest. He wasn   t emotional. I mean, in  a sense of expressing a lot of personal love to that degree of whatever  you want to say it. But he was hardworking, doubly hardworking, and he  was a Christian. He was a religious person. He was a faithful church  member and church worker and a deacon in the Baptist church. And he  gave me my chance. So I hope I haven   t disappointed him.  What do you think your father would think about the changes in the  University today, the campus building, all the growth, the enrollment,  population? Would he be proud of those? Would he be amazed?  To me, I   m just going to say it: It   s a high tech revolution. It   s just real  hard to keep up. It   s speedy. The acceleration of change has gotten so   I  think he would understand it. In my fifteen years on the Perry School  Board, I   ve often wondered,    What is the definition of an educated  person?    I think everyone on the school board said,    Well, it   s not the  initials behind their name.    (Laughs) You know the people who have  many degrees and they really don   t have the common sense. We tried to  make up our own definition around the school board meeting.    What are  we trying to do here?    So we came up with this phraseology. A person  can be said to be educated when they are completely aware, because  we   re never completely aware of the total consequences. We   ll never be  completely aware of the total consequences of our actions and thoughts.  We added thoughts and actions. And then we put and behave  accordingly. So we feel like that maybe under those circumstances,  maybe the Galilean from Nazareth was the only completely educated  person there was. There   s a moral tone to education that used to be felt  like more prominent than it is now. But that   s not true. It   s just as moral  now as it was. We   re just stretching it. Moral   the behavior of youth is  always a mystery. And the actions and the patterns should not be judged  just by a few. Most of the youth and college students understand the  moral qualities of behavior. I think that he would accept the University  changes and would say,    Work harder, work harder.     What are your thoughts, Charles, about the Alumni Association and how  it   s evolved over the years since your father   s era?  26  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Jerry, you   ve done a lot for us, and we appreciate that. Bless your heart.  We think that it has done a wonderful job. It   s served a cross intersection  for faculty, for students, for alumni. The construction of the new  ConocoPhillips Alumni building is a masterpiece, a masterpiece. Very  nice. I mean, it   ll be there from now on. I think it   s evolved into parallel  interests just as strong as it did to the Foundation. As I understand it  now, Jerry, we   re in the midst of   we should have a foundation for just  the Alumni. Are we into that?  Yes.  We   re getting because the dream has grown so big that we can   t just  budget it in the university budget. We   ve got to have financial resources  and support from all alumni. We need to think that   s a wonderful step,  and I know Dad would be proud of that and he would say,    Amen    to  the way it   s evolved and the way it   s going. I haven   t gotten closely  acquainted with the new director or new secretary yet. But we think that  it   s a self-perpetuating model, and I guess we have looked at other  universities and seen how they do it too, but I think we   re on the right  track, in other words. I   m sure Dad would just say that.  It   s sort of an opinion, but I want you to think about this one. Your father  was so important to the University over the twenty-three years in his  role as secretary of the Former Student Association, but also the  Placement Bureau and many other ways. How do you think your father  would want people to remember him and his era? How would he have  wanted people to remember A.O. Martin?  Positive, hardworking, a leader in the growth of education. He seemed to  me to be satisfied with his efforts. I thought he was never openly critical  or any   can   t remember him ever being negative about anything about  Oklahoma A M. He would not have liked to be called a shaker and a  mover, probably. (Laughs) But he didn   t want to be overly prominent.  No. But he wanted his shoulder to always be at the wheel, pushing. I  wish I could tell him that more now. You know, these thoughts occur to  me and we never talked this way before to him or between us or  anything. But he did so much for me in my professional life and in that  letter of acceptance to the medical school which I never dreamed about  or thought,    We   ll do it after the war is over.    I didn   t think we   d do it  during the war, of course as far as my own education goes. But he saw  the opportunity and so I owe him everything.  Can you speculate with me a little bit? Your father obviously very much  valued education and he worked so hard.  Yes, he did.  27  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  We talked about what it meant to him. I want to ask you, do you think  part of what drove him to work all the hours that he did and to handle  multiple responsibilities is how deeply he felt about the importance of  education for young people?  I do, Jerry, I do. I think that was motivation of his existence; his  professional existence was so centered on that one theme that he felt like  public education was the answer. He   d say,    Plus the church, so plus the  moral additions.    His whole theme of his life and efforts and everything  was education. Of course, I realize at that time in America, coming up  out of the agrarian farm life and everything, it seemed to be the  impossible dream. Now, here, we   ve made it possible for so many more  that that would be a fulfillment of his dream.  Again, we   re kind of speculating the discussion, but Dr. Bennett shared  a lot of the same dreams, you know.  That   s true.  And I   m struck by the fact     The similarity of the two. Yes, Dr. Bennett was funny. You mentioned  that. I hadn   t thought of that exactly, but yes I think they both were  lifelong educators and felt like public education for all qualified students  was the basic foundation of our country, really.  They had seen in your father   s generation and Dr. Bennett   s generation  hardships growing up on the farm and seeing how they were able to get  an education, they and people who were from their generation, for the  first time out of the womb called the working classes.  Yes.  And how it changed their lives.  Yes.  And it seems to me, as we   re talking, I   ve heard you mention things  about the importance of helping recruit students, helping place students.  I don   t know if we talked about it, but a lot of the clubs, the county clubs,  and the Alumni Association had scholarship funds and would make  loans for students to go to school.  Yes.  So it seems like it was the common theme of making it available to the  28  Martin  Gill  Martin  Gill  Martin  common people or the working class.     Upward migration,    they call it. It   s supporting the middle class,  developing a middle class, so to speak. We need to have the  development of educated citizens so our country will survive. So,  education is the link down, that   s why public schools, high schools and  so forth, are so important that we give every opportunity to not have any  dropouts. We   ve got to somehow help the youth understand that they  need to have the education. Athletics is a good example, though. I mean,  I   m so proud of athletics of being the supporting link that will keep  students in school and they get an education that way. I think it   s a  wonderful opportunity.  Dr. Martin, is there anything that we haven   t talked about that you   d  like to share? Something about your father or that you remember about  your experiences that we didn   t touch on?  Jerry, it   s been a joy to talk to you. I appreciate everything. We   ve  covered a lot of territory and I compliment you on your efforts and your  questioning and your job. So I   m going to give you an A+ on your  transcript.  (Laughter) Thank you. Okay. We   ll end with that.  You   ve got it.  -------  -------
