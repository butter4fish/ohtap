Rachel Seidman: This is Rachel Seidman. I&#8217;m here with Laura Edwards at her home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Today is Thursday, August 29, 2013, and Laura, if you don&#8217;t mind just saying your name so I can get a test.
Laura Edwards: Sure. Laura Edwards.
RS: Okay. So, Laura, why don&#8217;t we start by having you talk about what you remember about your grandparents? Did you know them? Did you see them growing up? Who were they?
LE: My grandparents are Joseph M. and Kathleen Bryan and they lived in Greensboro. He worked for my grandmother&#8217;s father&#8217;s company, called Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance Company. He was a large-personality man, and my grandmother was very kind, and they were very worldly, and they traveled a bit. He also, additionally to the life insurance part of Jefferson Standard Pilot Life, he was also instrumental in putting together a communications arm of the company. He traveled all over the country, including Hawaii, to buy radio and television stations, and thus was formed WBT, down in Charlotte, the Jefferson television station, and JP Sports, and all of that. They lived in Greensboro, and that&#8217;s where Mom spent all of her childhood mostly. And we lived in Charlotte, and that&#8217;s where I spent most of my young childhood. So we&#8217;d come up for visits but when we moved back to Greensboro we got to know them very well, and it was a nice, respectful relationship.
RS: So these were your mom&#8217;s parents?
LE: That&#8217;s correct.
RS: And what about your dad&#8217;s parents?
LE: My dad&#8217;s parents are from Mt. Airy. I haven&#8217;t seen them but a couple of times in my whole life. My father and my mother divorced when I was three, I think, so there wasn&#8217;t a lot of opportunity to get up there and see them and I never knew them really. My memory does not serve me anything outstanding about them.
RS: Was your mom a single mom when you were growing up?
LE: She was, and I was the baby of eight.
RS: Wow.
LE: Yes. She had six children with Ray Taylor, all my brothers and sisters ahead of me, and then me and my sister with Dad, who was Roy Edwards, but we all stayed with Mom. I felt like it was sort of like the dads kind of came in and out: &#8220;I&#8217;ve done my six. Now it&#8217;s your turn to do the rest.&#8221; [Laughs] But we were never considered anything but brothers and sisters. When we were asked, &#8220;Is this your half brother, or your step?&#8221; you know, we never talked about it in that terminology. Mom didn&#8217;t talk about us like that. So, yeah, she raised us all.
RS: Wow. So can you talk a little bit about growing up in a household with all those siblings and a single mom?
LE: Just happy to be alive, that&#8217;s all. [Laughs]
RS: [Laughs]
LE: You know, when you&#8217;re the baby of eight, you&#8217;re just kind of running around, trying to figure out how to get through your day, in other words. And with a single mom as active as she was, she was civically active, and she liked to get involved with social things and politics and community things, and she traveled a bit. So I guess I had a couple of moms. I had Mom, you know, Kay Edwards, and then I had my black mamas, Bertie and Namiah, and I had a black daddy, who was Jesse. He was the guy that did all the yard work and he would drive us to do things in Charlotte and Greensboro, [a] very sweet, kind gentleman. Bertie was a task master and she raised all of us. My brother is now sixty-four and I am fifty-one, and she&#8217;s been involved in our lives for about sixty years and [is] still alive.
RS: Wow. So, did your mom or Bertie talk about being a woman and dealing with all of this stuff, raising kids by themselves? Were there ways in which this experience--? So it was not the experience--. Some people whose mom is a single mom and had eight kids would be struggling significantly financially, and it wasn&#8217;t that kind of situation, but it must have been a struggle in other ways for her, I&#8217;m sure, or at least not what she expected maybe? I don&#8217;t know.
LE: I don&#8217;t think she asked for this. I do know her own experience was spent with a nanny growing up because her parents were civically active, socially active, traveled a bit, professionally very active. My grandfather was working at Jefferson Standard and also starting his own communications arm of the company. So her experience was a lot like professional nanny and then boarding school, and then she got married so young, at twenty, and had her first child at twenty. So that was her experience, so perhaps she carried that over to my experience and our experience as a family, and so we just sort of watched her. Versus hearing about it, we watched it happening, to us and with us.   So we were indoctrinated very quickly on how to make our way in the world and how to take care of ourselves, be independent thinkers, be independent in our activities. She really relished the idea of showing us the world, not only seeing it in books and on early TV, you know, but showing us around at the earliest, quickest time she could think that we could do it. And at that point in her life she had the financial wherewithal to do that with us. The disparity between me and my brother, of thirteen years, was such that I was born and he&#8217;s almost in high school, so that whole upper part of the group kind of went off to high school and college. That left the last four kind of at home and near Mom, and they were all girls. So that relationship became a very feminine household, and everybody got up to speed pretty quickly on what it was to be a woman together under one roof, and having a mom who was a feminist and an activist and a civic leader.
RS: And when you say she was a feminist, what did that mean to you, or what would it mean to her, do you think?
LE: I think--. [Pause] Feminist. It has so many different connotations to it and everybody brings their own view of what feminism is, and again I have this feeling that from the earliest of time on this earth with me and Mom and the rest of my family, primarily the younger part of the family, that we watched, we experienced feminism versus sitting down and hearing feminism. Mom was so smart and she really wanted us to live in the moment. And I do recall a couple occasions where we lived through civil rights in the [19]60s with my mom, and then we lived through the Vietnam War through her eyes and the television era when we got to see all this, and it was very apparent. But Mom&#8217;s feminism wasn&#8217;t as Socratic as it was experiential, and we learned what it was to be a strong, southern woman.
RS: Living through the civil rights movement in a household where you had African-American people living with you, or at least being there a lot of the time, how did that shape your experience?
LE: I bet you could poll anybody in North Carolina of my family&#8217;s stature, perhaps, status in life, and talk about the relationship that they had with--. Mom didn&#8217;t call them &#8220;staff.&#8221; My grandmother did. My grandmother&#8217;s staff was white-jacketed for the gentlemen with black pants and pressed shirts, and white nursing-like dresses, very pressed, for the women. Mom&#8217;s was more women. She really liked the interaction between women, and Jesse really was a quiet actor. We did a lot with them. I&#8217;m telling you, I was raised by these folks. And Mom, God bless her, we&#8217;re all running around in school, and Mom, in the late [19]60s, we&#8217;d go to school, and Mom was a volunteer truant officer. One of her partners in her office was a white woman who fell in love with a black man in Charlotte, North Carolina. They could not have a reception, they could not have a wedding, they could not have a party, they could not go and spend the night out together once they got married. And Mom said basically, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re not going to have a problem with that because you&#8217;re going to do it at my house.&#8221; The house we lived in, in Charlotte, North Carolina, was ground zero in the most prominent section of the entire city, and she basically said, &#8220;Fig on you. We&#8217;re going to do it and we&#8217;re going to do it well, and it&#8217;s going to be at our house, and we&#8217;re not going to blink.&#8221; So that left a massive impression on me. Arthur Ashe and Phil Dent were playing Davis Cup. Arthur Ashe could not get a hotel room. We put him up at my house.   So, even though we had this unbelievable status difference--. At night they would go back to their neighborhoods and to their own family that they haven&#8217;t been with all day. They went to school, their children went to school, but they didn&#8217;t see their family all day because they&#8217;re busy taking care of a white person&#8217;s family. Jesse lived three days in Charlotte and then went back to his house in Greensboro, so he lived in a room that Mom made for him in the basement, and it wasn&#8217;t yucky, it just was in the basement. I remember talking to him one time. We moved from Charlotte when I was seven and I would do yard work with him. He sort of adopted me because I was the runt of the litter, [laughs] and he really adopted me. He was my guy. We were together. I really felt the need for a male influence, Susan not so much. My sister, Susan, really felt drawn to Mom but I felt drawn and I felt sort of like I needed a male influence in my life, so Jesse filled that spot for me. So he would teach me everything: how to cut the grass, how to prune, how to garden, what do worms do, what his hands worked, what tools look like, his grace, his simplicity, his faith. So one day we were in Greensboro, I guess I was about seven, and I was looking at him and I said, &#8220;Jesse, are you my daddy?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;No, baby, I&#8217;m not your daddy. I&#8217;d love to be your daddy but your daddy lives in Florida.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh, okay,&#8221; sort of much like seven-year-olds, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go do something else. Let&#8217;s go prune the hedge,&#8221; you know, whatever, moved on very quickly. But it left an impression on me, and I am so grateful for my mother not to see color in such a way that I don&#8217;t have an opinion about what black and white was in a classist way or a racist way. I felt culturally, emotionally, and physically aligned with the people that raised me and were so influential in my life, like Jesse and Bertie.
RS: And then you went off to school.
LE: I did.
RS: Boarding school?
LE: I did, yeah.
RS: At what age did you go?
LE: I was fourteen, and that was in Richmond, St. Catherine&#8217;s School, and it was tenth grade.
RS: All girls?
LE: All girls. It was a day school from K through twelve, and then additionally a boarding department from ninth through twelfth grade.
RS: And how was that experience of leaving home and going to school?
LE: Saved me.
RS: Really?
LE: Yeah, saved me.
RS: Wow.
LE: Saved me. I was an angry, young, rebellious, uninterested-in-school young woman, young girl, and it gave me structure, routine, twenty-four-seven care, a spiritual influence. [St. Catherine&#8217;s] was an Episcopalian based boarding school, and we had to be at church in the morning three times a week. I was raised Catholic so Episcopalian is so close to that that it felt very familiar to me to be in that setting, and then it just became richer and richer. And the elements of a boarding school, when you close the door at 10:00 and lock everybody in with counselors on the hall, this tribal oneness happens, and the stories that evolved and the relationships that evolved from that were phenomenal. I found my dad through one of the boarders who was two years older than me. We had lost track for ten years, from when I was five to fourteen or fifteen, and I was just talking to somebody and they say, &#8220;Roy Edwards? Well, that&#8217;s my dad&#8217;s really good friend.&#8221; So one thing led to another and we found each other after a long time, and he came to see me at St. Catherine&#8217;s. Pretty neat.
RS: How was that?
LE: I was nervous and anxious, and it was like my prince on a white stallion, if you will. I&#8217;d been missing him and wanting him for so long, and their breakup was so brutal. He basically lost the will to fight for me at that point, and Mom could make it perhaps a little hard for him to do that. He wasn&#8217;t the kindest of guys when they were married. He was absent, he just was absent for so long, and then I wrote him a letter. No email, no phone calls except for one in the middle of the hall. It was a coin telephone booth in the middle of the hall and we used that to dial back and forth. But anyway, I wrote him a letter. I found out where he was, I wrote him a letter, and he wrote me this love letter back, just a love letter, and he said, &#8220;If you wouldn&#8217;t mind calling me, I&#8217;d love to hear from you.&#8221;   So I go in the middle of the hall, and by this time the drumbeat has happened through the entire school: Laura&#8217;s going to be reunited with her father! So at least the whole hall of fifty people know that this is getting ready to happen. So we call each other and talk to each other and he said, &#8220;I want to come see you,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;That would be great.&#8221; My room was right above the front door, so he was a very prompt guy and he pulls up. It was winter, he pulled up, and I remember him striding to the front door, beautiful overcoat, and there were people crammed into the windows, looking out the windows, and the front hall operator said, &#8220;Laura, you have a visitor. Come downstairs,&#8221; and everybody&#8217;s screaming: &#8220;Yay! You&#8217;re going to have fun! Yay, yay, yay!&#8221; So I go downstairs and he&#8217;s looking out the glass of the front door, and I tap him on the shoulder and he turns around and he just swoops me up, and it was like some spinning, dreamy experience. He just sort of stepped into my world again and filled it up with such great depth of love and affection and attention, just what I needed, I guess, just what I needed and had longed for, and perhaps he had pined for himself.
RS: So were you able to maintain that over time?
LE: The one thing about boarding school is that you get permissions from your parents of what you can and cannot do. At that point there was smoking, and you had to sign out if you could smoke. We did have a relationship in my tenth grade year and my eleventh grade year, but halfway through my eleventh grade year, somebody decided to look at my permissions to see if, just by chance, anything they needed to know about my permissions. And they found out that on the back of my permission slip Mom said, &#8220;If Laura is to ever see her father she is not to be alone with him and to leave the campus with him.&#8221; So I went downstairs, and the headmaster, the hall person, the dean of the boarding school, and my father [were] sitting there waiting on me, in the parlor, and I&#8217;m going, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on? Why is everybody so gloomy?&#8221; They told me of that, and Dad just started crying, and he said, &#8220;Your mother is pretty tough, honey, and she really wants us to go this way.&#8221; I sort of begged him, I said, &#8220;Dad, you&#8217;ve got to fight for me.&#8221; So they let us go that one night, for the last night, basically, out to dinner and stuff, and then my boyfriend at the time would sign me out and then I&#8217;d meet my dad, so I was sort of sneaking out, going out with my boyfriend and then he&#8217;d hand me over to my father. That just got so taxing, and lying, and untruthful. It was stressful for me, it was stressful for him. So we lost each other again halfway through my senior year.   Then I recall I was a point guard on our basketball team and we were playing our rival, Collegiate, across town, and we were at Collegiate playing our last game of the year, And Greensboro College was looking at me to see if they would recruit me for basketball. So I&#8217;m playing in the game, and we&#8217;re going into the locker room at halftime, and I&#8217;m running in there and up from the stands I hear, &#8220;Fake and drive, kid, fake and drive.&#8221;
RS: [Laughs]
LE: I look up, and there&#8217;s that old man right there, looking at me and telling me to fake and drive, fake and drive. So my coach let me go out with him that night and covered for me because, of course, the story had big legs and had a dreamy component. He&#8217;d been there for almost two years, going to as many games as he could, so everybody got to know him. So, it was disappointing again.
RS: And what about once you became an adult?
LE: The staying power between both of us just didn&#8217;t glue. We saw each other maybe twice more, and then he died in [19]89, actually [19]88, so he died very young.
RS: So, if you don&#8217;t want to talk about it you don&#8217;t have to, but the story you told at the beginning of admiration for your mom and this wonderful, warm upbringing by her and Bertie and Jesse, but then we get to high school and you&#8217;re angry, and it saved your life.
LE: Yeah.
RS: And I see now there were some pretty significant reasons to be angry. I mean, I don&#8217;t know what else was going on.
LE: Yeah.
RS: Did that shape your--? So I think of you as this really strong woman, and independent, and promoting women&#8217;s political power, and all of these things, but your original model for all of this independence came with significant cost, it sounds like, and complexity. Was there something you had to--? Well, I don&#8217;t know. As you grew, how did your thoughts about your mother change over time? It sounds like there was significant--. Well, okay, let&#8217;s start with going off to school. How did the relationship with your mom change over time? Or just describe, after you went off to school, what became your relationship back to your home? Did you go home much?
LE: Going off to school for most of us was a choice. For me it was not. I was very comfortable at Greensboro Day School. I was excelling in sports, not so much in academics, but really excelling at sports. I was co-captain of the boys&#8217; soccer team because there wasn&#8217;t any girls&#8217; team, and I was excelling in field [hockey]. Just really well rounded. I was singing. I was very involved. My mom started Greensboro Day School with three other, four other families. Back in [19]69, or whenever we went to Greensboro, she started it. So I went from second grade all the way up to ninth grade, so my experience was that.  Sports was saving my life, and these teachers and these coaches, and when I say saving my life, it was more about structure and being accountable, at least for part of your day, with someone really whipping you into shape if you weren&#8217;t accountable and structured. When I went home on the bus and got into the house, anybody could have been in the house at the time, or nobody could have been in the house at the time. I&#8217;m no different than any other latchkey kid that you talk about. I&#8217;m no different than anybody else. My God, if we did that today you&#8217;d be sent to social services, if you went home at ten years old and let yourself in and hung out and went out on your own, but my neighborhood was filled with other parents that were our parents. We were all each other&#8217;s families. So that was another different time.   I guess what I&#8217;m alluding to, the anger part of it, was that to maintain a household, Mom&#8217;s personal experience, what she came into [it] with, and how many children she had, being a single mom, having dreams and hopes and interests of her own, made it less inclined to be that taskmaster, structural, routine-oriented mother. She was very firm, she was a matriarch, and you were beautifully poised and perfect, polite, kind, generous, could carry a jacket up to the guest bedroom when people came from a party, white gloved, knew what to do and how to do it from age five. But that most intimate singular moments that parents and children share together, in my opinion, was something I was lacking, and I needed it. Maybe nobody else in my family did. I don&#8217;t know. I haven&#8217;t really polled them on that. But I needed it.   So Dad wasn&#8217;t there. I had my black mama and my black daddy taking care of me, and my oldest brother, Howard, was my male influence. Mom was a matriarchal player who taught us impeccable manners and went to see the Louvre at seven. So, fast forward to boarding school--there&#8217;s the context--fast forward to boarding school and I&#8217;m kicking and screaming to go. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go!&#8221; She goes, &#8220;You are going. I don&#8217;t know what to do with you,&#8221; basically, throwing her hands up. &#8220;You&#8217;re unruly, you sneak out, you&#8217;re smoking cigarettes, and this is tough on me. So, I&#8217;m sorry. You have a choice&#8211;St. Catherine&#8217;s, Madeira, St. Mary&#8217;s, Emma Willard&#8211;you have a couple of things to choose from, but then that&#8217;s it.&#8221; So I chose St. Catherine&#8217;s, and her coming to St. Catherine&#8217;s was few and far between. I came home much, much more, and at that time, again, you&#8217;ve got to get on a bus or a train, at fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, and come home, and this wasn&#8217;t uncommon for all of--. Parents weren&#8217;t running up to St. Catherine&#8217;s to go to every game like they are today. It was unheard of.   So again, the structure started forming, and the more I felt good about my experiences and my positive feedback from my accountability and my responsibilities, the more responsibility I was given. So at the end of my year at St. Catherine&#8217;s, my senior year I was a prefect, I was a hall counselor, I was captain of three teams, I received the most outstanding sports individual. I was the gold captain, which is the school is divided into two colors, white and gold, and you receive your color either by what your family was, or if you&#8217;d come in for the first time and nobody&#8217;s been there, just by the luck of the draw. I was a gold because my sister, Melanie, went there. So this is reserved for thirteen-year seniors, not three-year boarders, so I became the whole school gold captain. So it became clear that this experience, the more I gave, the more they gave me back. The more I got structure, the more I ate it up. The more they gave the one-on-one attention, I was ravenous for it, ravenous, and it saved my life, plain and simple.
RS: How do you think that being in an all-girls school and having, I assume, many women teachers and leaders and stuff, did that also start shaping your views on--?
LE: Absolutely, absolutely. Of course it did, and at St. Catherine&#8217;s you are taught right away that you are a cared, loved, strong, independent woman from the get-go, and if you choose responsibility and accountability, then many good things will happen to you. It was so traditional and a hundred years in the making of women who became leaders or went off to college and did what they needed to do throughout history, but the influences that I saw of the women and the male teachers were so respectful of women, so respectful of ability, no matter athletically, artistically, academically, in leadership positions and non-leadership positions. The respect was school-wide for a kindergarten through a twelfth-grader, and it was phenomenal, peer to peer, age to age.   I remember as gold captain we would go down to the lower school and rise them up and get them all excited about our spirit days, which we&#8217;d have games against each other of the whites and the golds to win the cup at the end, and of course senior year we won the gold cup, so that was fun. But this little peanut came up to me and wrapped her arms around my legs, just like any kindergartener would, and said--you know, because you&#8217;re just revered at that point. I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like today, but you&#8217;re revered as the gold captain of the whole school. She looks up at me and she goes, &#8220;Wow! I want to grow up just like you,&#8221; and I was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re doing just fine, honey, just on your own. Grow up just like you.&#8221; So, anyway, it was just a remarkable experience, and you feel like when you graduated there you could do anything.
RS: So then what?
LE: Again, my academic prowess was far out-shadowed by my athletic prowess, and I went to St. Mary&#8217;s down in Raleigh. It used to be [a two-year] college, now it&#8217;s a four-year high school, but it was a junior college, and my sports got me into the junior college. [I] went there in Raleigh. It was another girls&#8217; school. It was much smaller, primarily boarding, and again my leadership and my sports carried the day there, and then I transferred into Carolina for my junior year.
RS: And so you arrived in Carolina in [19]83?
LE: Two.
RS: [19]82.
LE: Mm hmm.
RS: So what was that transition like?
LE: Awesome.
RS: Yeah?
LE: Yeah. Well, we&#8217;d come over here all the time. It wasn&#8217;t a new experience for me. We&#8217;d come over here because we had friends. I had friends from all over the place at Carolina, so we&#8217;d go to mixers, frat parties, sorority parties, football games, that kind of thing.
RS: And I assume you continued playing sports.
LE: I did. I played on our club team for Pi Phi--I was a Pi Phi at Carolina--our sorority. And then my sister, Pricey Harrison was in law school, and she noticed there was no women&#8217;s lacrosse team, and she had experience at Emma Willard and at Duke playing lacrosse. She went to undergrad at Duke. So she and another friend started a club lacrosse team and she said, &#8220;I want you to be goalie of the lacrosse team.&#8221; I was goalie from seventh grade to twelfth grade for field hockey but I&#8217;d never played lacrosse, and she said, &#8220;Goalie&#8217;s goalie,&#8221; and I went, &#8220;Pricey, goalie on the ground is different than goalie up in the air. It&#8217;s a totally different thing.&#8221; [She said,] &#8220;I don&#8217;t care. You&#8217;ll play goalie.&#8221; So she started the lacrosse team, which is now national champions, so it was a wild experience.   But that was my sports thing, and then I didn&#8217;t do much involved with school government. I mostly did  protests. At that point in our lives it was divesting from South Africa, and Carolina had a significant investment, and so I recall makeshift shanties on campus and doing that work and protesting that.
RS: And were you part of a specific organization doing that?
LE: I joined in on other people doing that. But that was horrific, and I remember being a part of that movement on campus, that while we were here they divested from South Africa, and I&#8217;m not sure if it was just us. I think there was a lot of pressure from all over the world for everybody to make a change in how they dealt with South Africa, and Carolina saw the light, I believe.
RS: And how did that--? Because I had the same experience, so when I was at college we had the same divestment shanty towns and protests, and I always--. And we were also successful, and then a few years later South Africa--.
LE: Yeah.
RS: Right. And I always think that it had a major impact on my sense of the potential power of grassroots political organizing, that I saw it work. I think it gave me a kind of optimistic sense that not everyone has, particularly, I think, the generation that came after us didn&#8217;t have that. Do you think it impacted you the same way? I mean did you carry, did you feel--? You said Carolina saw the light, but did you feel like you had played a role in that?
LE: Oh, yeah. I remember participating in the shanty towns and having my hours  that [I] participated, with my books in my lap, studying and all that. I remember bull horn protesting. My voice does carry and I have a good command of my vocal chords and my lung capacity, so I could get in the Pit and do some proselytizing, or whatever else I needed to do, in protest of that, and to be honest with you--and this is another remarkable moment from my mother. Here comes another one. Mom had six children; it was 1960; she was living in Southern Pines; she was a single mom. Bertie was taking care of the children while she was going to what [is now called UNC-Greensboro and at that point] was called the Women&#8217;s College. She was driving up from Southern Pines to Women&#8217;s College to go to school during the day and to finish her degree, and while that was happening was February 1, 1960 and the sit-ins.   At that point in the sit-ins, the football players and the wrestlers would sit in, from A&amp;T and the area black schools, because the county boys would come in and give them a hard time. Mom still to this day says it wasn&#8217;t inner-city. It wasn&#8217;t Greensboro people. It was [people] out from the county that really came in and roughed up everybody. Then while the boys went to practice, Mom said that the women would take their place and study and sit in the stool. So all the boys, white or black, went to their football or basketball [practices] or whatever they were doing in February. And the women would sit in, and she sat in because she was at Women&#8217;s College, because Bennett College and Women&#8217;s College were asked to participate in the sit-ins. At that point the presidents of each school basically turned a blind eye and maybe had a public statement to make about their students participating, but privately did not penalize you if you did participate.   So, again, fast forward to having that knowledge and all the things that led up to what I&#8217;ve been founded and rooted in with my mother&#8217;s activism, helped form that. So I felt like I could protest any day, any time, for any reason and get it done. So, yes; that activity by myself helped form my opinion about my future of, if you protest, good things can happen.
RS: Did your mom&#8217;s parents--? Was this a major form of rebellion? I mean, did it upset them, her activism, or was this not a source of conflict in the family?
LE: I don&#8217;t remember.
RS: You don&#8217;t know.
LE: I don&#8217;t know that answer. My brothers and sisters might know that answer, because I was the youngest, and she was sort of out of the business, if you will, of that kind of activism when I came around, physically participating in a sit-in or a nonviolent protest. But I do remember when the Vietnam draft came, and we were in Greensboro, and they did the lottery on the TV and they pulled the lottery number, we all sat and watched. Mom made us sit and watch the lottery because my two brothers--. At that point, the draft had gotten so deep into a young man&#8217;s world that if you didn&#8217;t maintain a certain grade average, if you weren&#8217;t doing well in college, you could also get drafted. Well, my brothers were having an excellent time at UVA, just a really great time at [University of] Virginia, and their studies showed that. They were suffering in their academic life, not in their social life. So we sat there and watched that, everybody who was home watched that, and I recall looking at my mother, probably white as a sheet, as we all were, and luckily their numbers were far enough away where they weren&#8217;t having to get drafted. But that was the last moment I remember fear or concern about a highly charged moment in the history of the United States and watching it on my mom&#8217;s face.
RS: I was just trying to figure out if she comes from sort of a long--. You know, there are families in which there&#8217;s a long, long, deep, deep history of white progressive, or whether she was a new--.
LE: I think she was a maverick. I think she was rebellious and a maverick.
RS: Okay, so you continued to build this sense of leadership, that you had a role to play, and that you had skills and capacities for leadership when you were at UNC, it sounds like.
LE: Mm hmm.
RS: Were you developing a sense of what you wanted to do next, or where you wanted to go, or did you have a sort of vision of where you were headed?
LE: I did. I was an international studies major at Carolina--I think it&#8217;s still called that--and I wanted to pursue some type of political, active, engaging route, not necessarily in Washington but perhaps in New York or foreign, and my eyes were looking towards that until I fell in love with a course called &#8220;Radio, Television, Motion Picture&#8221; that used to exist at Carolina. It was my last class at Carolina, and much like people sort of bang their head and go, &#8220;Wow, I could have had a V8,&#8221; wow, I could have done this! So, anyway, [laughs] a little too late, but with one underneath my belt I felt engaged enough and confident enough to just stroll right up to New York and land a job anywhere. Well, you know, New York&#8217;s a big town, and I went and interviewed at a couple of spots and it never panned out, so that part of my journey of getting into the radio/television world was curtailed.
RS: Did you want to go as a radio/television personality or a producer or a reporter?
LE: A producer, but I knew I had to be a grunt, a mailroom or a page or something. I knew that was a part of the deal. I just didn&#8217;t know that I wouldn&#8217;t even get that. So without any experience at all in your college-or-before-life, there&#8217;s not a real chance. New York was the center of the universe in the mid [19]80s and I went there. I didn&#8217;t have a job. I decided on a Monday, I moved on a Friday, and I didn&#8217;t have a job. [Laughs] And I spent a month on a corner of somebody&#8217;s living room, a friend&#8217;s living room, and within two days I found a job at Orvis New York, running the women&#8217;s department of Orvis New York, their flagship store. I had zero experience in women&#8217;s clothes but I decided not to lie, so when they interviewed me they said, &#8220;Have you ever been a buyer?&#8221; and I thought to myself, &#8220;Well, Laura, yes you have.&#8221;
RS: [Laughs]
LE: &#8220;You&#8217;ve bought women&#8217;s clothes before.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Have you ever had management experience,&#8221; and I thought to myself, &#8220;Well, Laura, yes you have. You&#8217;ve been, during Christmas, an assistant manager of a warehouse in Raleigh, and yes, I do have [management experience.]&#8221; &#8220;Well then, you have a job.&#8221; So I did that for two months and that was quite an experience, at twenty-three, running a women&#8217;s department of a flagship store. Then Time, Inc., at the time, before they had bought Warner or AOL or anything like that, Time, Inc. was an avenue I was trying to pursue. It had HBO and it had all the magazines and I was like, &#8220;Well. That could be a route I could sink my teeth into.&#8221; My sister was working for Time Life Books in Alexandria and they moved her up to New York. She found an opening for me at the magazine, Time magazine, and I had an interview and, I swear to God, the guy said, &#8220;Can you play softball?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;I can.&#8221; He goes, &#8220;You&#8217;re hired.&#8221;
RS: [Laughs]
LE: And I went, &#8220;What?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Did you see my r&#233;sum&#233;? I&#8217;ve got international studies; I&#8217;ve got a significant amount of English course curriculum; I can talk about the world.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, we need a female for our male/female softball team. It&#8217;s the twentieth anniversary of the Publishing League and Time Life participation in softball and we need a woman who can play softball.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; So I was a fact checker, made my way through there the first couple of months as a fact checker, and then two top editors took a liking to me and said, &#8220;We want you to pursue a career at the company. We don&#8217;t care where it is, but we see you as editorial material, to be in the production end of it.&#8221; So I said, &#8220;Well, thanks. That&#8217;s great.&#8221; [I&#8217;m twenty-four] and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;okay.&#8221;   So there was an in-house news magazine called FYI and they asked if I would apply for it, and that&#8217;s an editorial producer position. It comes out every two weeks, pre-email, and you stripped in all of it. So I typeset it and went to a different magazine in their art department to strip in everything. I typeset it, I edited it, I had two writers who were in their thirties, a photographer who was in her thirties, and an unlimited art budget for cartoons and portfolio folk to come through to do cartoons, and I kind of pinched myself. I was going, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s just happened to me, but I guess I&#8217;m in the right place at the right time.&#8221; Again, the leadership of this corporation saw something in me, and again I responded to that positive feedback of, &#8220;I will give you more to eat if you&#8217;ll give me more of yourself.&#8221;
RS: Right.
LE: So it just grew and fed upon each other, just on and on and on. So that&#8217;s how the production part became a confidence builder in me, and then I got a big view of the world and what was going on because I&#8217;d participated in the leader of all things news at that time, Time, Inc. It was. It just was. And there was money to go around. It was the go-go [19]80s and there was money everywhere at that company. And oh, by the way, we did win the Publishing League that year [laughs] at softball.
RS: [Laughs] And how long did you stay there?
LE: Almost two years in New York and then I came back to school for radio, television, motion picture, and was hired away, before I finished my curriculum, to work with an organization called Year Look Enterprises. It was a video [yearbook] company, and I worked with them, and then I started my own company called New Rhythms. I booked bands for a living, from the Mississippi over. My mom loved that, and she loved going to cocktail parties and going, &#8220;Oh, yeah. My daughter books bands: leather jackets, motorcycles, she hangs out in nightclubs.&#8221; She loved it. She loved that maverick in me, maybe something she didn&#8217;t get to do back in her twenties and thirties, so she loved that.
RS: That seems like a big shift there.
LE: Yes.
RS: In that you&#8217;d been offered this sort of route through Time, Inc. but you left.
LE: Yeah.
RS: So what prompted that?
LE: I always wanted to listen to that calling of that radio/television/motion picture route. I always wanted to participate somehow in that world, and being accessible to HBO and to NBC and everything around me. And [in] Rock Center, where we all were, we got to sort of play around with each in that general Rock Center area. It exposed me to all these different types of publishing and early electronic and television, and I just was like, &#8220;God, I really want to pursue this,&#8221; so I did that.   So it stayed at the production role. I excelled in spinning plates up on sticks. I was good at plate spinning. I could tackle five things at a time and not really get bothered by it. So it exposed me again to more and more things like that, and then I started my own production company. I decided not to work for somebody else and work for myself. Then I did documentary work, and that brought me back into active civil discourse and a relationship to society and to my political world. My first documentary followed two North Carolina Special Olympic athletes, and I was associate producer on that. With that brought me back to the challenges not only emotionally, mentally, but also politically and civically, what they go through to be a part of our society: how do they integrate into our society, what does that look like, where are the injustices of it, what are the complications or the misunderstandings? And then come around again to that, let me fall in love again with my international studies, my political bent. I was always a Democrat, Yellow Dog Democrat, liberal, liberal, liberal. My mother&#8217;s liberal, liberal, liberal, Kennedy-esque liberal, and to much is given, much is expected. That&#8217;s sort of what my grandparents gave to their children, and my aunts and uncles gave to their children, and my mother gave to me: to much is given, much is expected. So there&#8217;s a hand particularly on my shoulder that I felt that I came back to. It took a strange route, but that documentary experience and being producer on my own terms got me back connected without bureaucracy. It gave me that one-on-one connection to do that again, and that sparked and reenergized a whole other level of activism for me.
RS: And so what was the route that that&#8211;?
LE: For a little while I was doing Special Olympics work, working with their games here in North Carolina, and then that broadened my vision about legalities and opportunities. Then by chance, I just fell into the full-on feminism explosion. Really, a moment in my history that I will never, ever forget, was forming in the [19]89 March on Washington with everybody else for Roe v. Wade and reproductive freedom and rights. That was a huge, huge moment, galvanizing many women and men across the country to let our hearts and minds be known about that. That was the big protest. [Laughs]
RS: Yeah. I was there. [Laughs]
LE: Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then the human rights campaign. I was getting to know that I was a lesbian. I was slow to really putting that together, and my own personal story of coming to terms with that connected me to struggle of a part of society that is not recognized and connected, and downright shamed, and I felt like I had to reengage because of that and because I found reproductive rights very harming. The anti-choice movement was very damaging. I&#8217;ve taken four friends to get abortions, and the other side was saying things that just were not true or were not helping the dialogue and the emotional dynamic of what was going on in the country.   So pairing all those moments together there was just a crucible. There was a moment in time that I&#8217;ll remember, going to my first EMILY&#8217;s List moment, a luncheon in Washington. I was seeing someone and she was a major donor of the organization so I got to sit at the head table, fifteen hundred women, and the guest speaker was President Clinton, and he had just newly been elected. The Oklahoma City bombing had happened. The crazy law student, perhaps, or whoever, had just gotten an automatic rifle and walked through Chapel Hill shooting people indiscriminately. So my mind was stirring with that, I&#8217;m seeing this person, and I&#8217;m elevated to this real preferred status at this massive event that I didn&#8217;t really know about, and he comes out and he gets a standing ovation for five minutes. Five minutes. And I&#8217;d never seen that before. It was phenomenal. I was like, &#8220;Okay. Well, this feels good.&#8221; And the hairs on my arms and legs and back and neck were just standing up on top of each other. I was like, &#8220;Okay. This feels really good to me. Now I can get it.&#8221; And then he spoke for an hour without having to look at a thing.   Since I was on the front I got to walk the rope line, so I walked the rope line and he shook my hand and he looked at me and he called me by name, and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m so proud of you and what you said about violence and gun violence. We just had gun violence in Chapel Hill,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Oh, yes. I&#8217;ve heard of that, and I hope you&#8217;ll read my white paper on that.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, I hope I can find it,&#8221; and a week later, either by chance or by having my social security number, my address, and whatever, and everybody got white papers on the Oklahoma City bombing and that was the topic of the day, but it came to me within a week. A week. And I was like, &#8220;This is activism. This is, say what you mean, put it on a piece of paper, say it passionately, follow through.&#8221; Again, good things will happen if you follow through and you&#8217;re rewarded for it. So I was a convert from the get-go, and the EMILY&#8217;s List structure meant a lot to me. It was narrowly focused. It didn&#8217;t go all over the place. Pro-choice, Democratic women for higher office, period. I was like, &#8220;Wow. Okay. I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221;
RS: So then you immediately brought that model to Chapel Hill? Did you talk to Jan Allen? How did that happen?
LE: So when I became a convert to EMILY&#8217;s List I became a Majority Council member, which is a donor of a thousand dollars or more, and there were a couple women from North Carolina--Amanda Smith, Jan Allen--who were thousand-dollar donors and more and would go to something called the Majority Council Conference. It was a select group and at that time EMILY&#8217;s List was maybe--this is [19]94--maybe ten thousand women, twenty thousand women, and then do that and shrink down the size of the highest donors, four hundred women in all. So you got to kind of look across a room and eyeball some pretty fantastic women who were coming from all over the country, and lo and behold, there was a couple from my own neighborhood. So EMILY&#8217;s List put a steering committee together of Majority Council members, and again saw leadership possibility in me, and asked me to be part of the steering committee to grow the list in North Carolina. To do that, I asked Mom to throw a party in Chapel Hill. We threw a party in Chapel Hill. Jan Allen came, we met, [said], &#8220;Can&#8217;t we do this in North Carolina? I&#8217;m not getting any response from EMILY&#8217;s List. They just don&#8217;t have the time or the inclination or the money or whatever. They don&#8217;t see that it could happen here.&#8221; Jan Allen said, &#8220;I think it could easily happen here,&#8221; and thus is born the idea of it all.   So we got together, and got together, and got together, literally the basement, literally the kitchen table, the whole way all great things start with women--or men, but mostly women--around the kitchen table with their buddies and their influences that have helped them in their lifetimes come together. We started gathering people little by little, like a cotton candy machine, started out with this core group, and then it just got bigger and bigger and bigger, and then structure happened, and then we threw a party at Betsy Buford&#8217;s in Raleigh, and oh my, gosh, two hundred and fifty people show up, and everybody became a convert of Lillian&#8217;s List. So you were touched very personally by Elaine Marshall that day, the only woman to break the glass ceiling at that point in time in North Carolina politics, as Secretary of State, and phenomenal things and fast changes were happening. We were there at the right time, in the right place. It was the end of the Clinton era, everybody was democratized again in North Carolina, things were shaking out, it was becoming a purple state, we still held all the branches of office, it was Gov. Hunt. Things were still moving in that right direction. It was fertile but hungry for something different, and we were different, very narrowly focused, very, very different.
RS: Did Lillian&#8217;s List become a full time focus for you?
LE: Mm hmm.
RS: It&#8217;s been now, what?
LE: Fifteen years.
RS: Fifteen years. So what have you learned about women and politics and social change? That was a really sort of juicy description of the beginning. We&#8217;re in a very different period now. But over fifteen years, what have you been thinking about, changing, working on? How has the organization changed from the beginning? What lessons have you taken out of it?
LE: Let&#8217;s go from your last question first. August 29, 2013 is--. To me there&#8217;s a pall over North Carolina, and what Lillian&#8217;s List, over fifteen years, has taught me is basically that it is a constant vigil, that, much like Martin Luther King said, you don&#8217;t wait for power to happen; you go get it. I don&#8217;t want to steal anything from this moment in history, but fifteen years into Lillian&#8217;s List, and here we are at one of the lowest points of women participation in our government, in the state all branches of government are in Republican hands right now, and we found in Lillian&#8217;s List a way to touch women outside politics as usual. We asked them to participate, for a reason to get progressive, pro-choice, Democratic, women to participate in the dialogue and the language that is being forged in laws in North Carolina. We got caught up in a maelstrom in 2010 and 2012. In a lot of ways it was out of our own hands, and they conquered 2010 and 2012 which meant they get to redraw the maps, and they pitted women against other women in precincts and in districts, and it cut our numbers in half. I think it&#8217;s despicable, and I don&#8217;t want to get angry. I want to use this anger and, much like I like to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get mad; get elected.&#8221;   So it fuels me. As an emeritus status of Lillian&#8217;s List, it fuels me and it fills me with a renewed energy to get going again, like I haven&#8217;t maybe since ever. It&#8217;s critical right now in North Carolina for women to see what is happening to them, and for forty-eight some odd years it happened for and with me, especially the last ten years of that lifetime, from my late thirties to late forties. It happened with me. Now it&#8217;s happening to me, and it&#8217;s happening to us, women and their families particularly, and I will not stand by and watch that happen, not on my watch, not while I&#8217;m alive. It might take me til I&#8217;m eighty to turn this ship around, but too many good people have made this state into what it is today. Too many good women--Ruth Easterling, B [Bertha Merrill] Holt, Betty Ray McCain, Bev Perdue, Elaine Marshall--have stuck their neck out, participated to the fullest degree to make this state a possibility for women to fully participate, for us to stop and take a breath right now. There&#8217;s just no time. We don&#8217;t have time anymore.
RS: Do you find that you [and] the people around you are able to get that same energy? And I&#8217;m sure you spend much of your energy trying to energize other people, because I imagine that for a lot of people it&#8217;s a sense of defeat, it&#8217;s a sense of what&#8217;s the point, and people choose different ways of responding. Ellie Kinnaird now stepping away and putting her energy in something else, so she might argue this is just as important as--. I don&#8217;t know. But there&#8217;s a lot of people sort of throwing up their hands, and then there&#8217;s a lot of people getting energized, like we see in the Moral Mondays movement. I know you must be getting tired.
LE: No, no, no. I&#8217;m good.
RS: I&#8217;m curious, at this moment in time, about this Moral Mondays thing--and people are calling this North Carolina&#8217;s new social movement--how you see that, as a longtime political activist, its relation--. Is this going to be a multi-pronged movement? Do you see the women&#8217;s [movement]? Do you think it&#8217;s going to succeed, from where you stand now, in bringing together the sort of women&#8217;s issues activists and the NAACP and the environmentalists and the teachers? Are you feeling optimistic about it from your vantage point, or not? As someone really deeply connected to the political activists in the state, how do you see that?
LE: Art Pope really put a whammy on this state. Citizens United stepped on all of our throats across the country. Getting that decision made is the biggest black eye in our country that I can remember, besides taking certain and most provisions out of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. We are far from business being done. Just look at yesterday. We celebrated Martin Luther King. Did any Republican celebrate Martin Luther King? Did any white Republican celebrate Martin Luther King? We are now so fractured, so divided in our country and in our state that we have to find a moral route to some solace and consensus. These Moral Mondays offer that route physically, an actual walking-the-route. I&#8217;m certain that walking-the-route, that standing, that walking up to the legislature, that putting a ring around the fountain, holding hands upstairs and downstairs, singing Negro spirituals--&#8220;Negro spirituals&#8221; because that&#8217;s what I call it. But African American spirituals and protest spirituals are as alive today as they were two hundred, three hundred, one hundred, one hundred and fifty, fifty years ago, and [that] the promise that was being made by the people in front of us can be wiped away in a legislative year is shameful, and could be downright disparaging and cause everyone not to dig in and do this again. If you noticed in the Moral Mondays, this is not the first rodeo for a lot of those people. A lot of them were eighty and ninety and have done this, and said it out loud--you could poll anybody again--&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m doing this again. I thought this was finished business. I thought we were doing good things. I thought we were moving forward and here we are again, doing this again.&#8221;   What I also saw was the youth movement in these Moral Mondays. I saw through their eyes that it&#8217;s important to them that their rights as the youth, with voice and interest and determination, and their future&#8217;s way ahead of them. They don&#8217;t believe in any of this stuff that the Civitas and Citizens United and the Art Popes and the Koch brothers believe in. They don&#8217;t believe in this. Poll after poll on college campuses don&#8217;t believe in this. And the defiant nature, winner take all, uncaring who&#8217;s in their way, dismissive attitude, has awakened the consciousness and reawakened the consciousness of this state and this nation. Mark my words, 2014, between now and the election in 2014, we will figure out a way to figure out this voting rights suppression in North Carolina if it takes sleepless nights for weeks and weeks and weeks. We&#8217;ll figure out how to get college kids to that one polling place in one location and to get there on time before the lines are shut. We will find a way to get the college kids the right IDs to get to vote. We will find a way for our senior citizens, our females, our black citizens, our low income folk, our Hispanic people, our disenfranchised people, the means to get to the polling places and vote. And then in 2014 I say we hold our own, even with the way that they&#8217;ve redrawn our maps, and then in 2016 we get back in the game.   But there&#8217;s plenty of people at all levels of society that this does not sit well with, and it&#8217;s not just Democrats, and it&#8217;s not just college kids. It is all across the spectrum. They overstepped. They overstepped. North Carolina, because it&#8217;s my home, was a different Southern state. It was, and that&#8217;s why a lot of people are here. It was a different Southern state. You could live and thrive in communities that had so much potential, culturally, spiritually, actively, academically, professionally. You could thrive. We have the mountains. We have the coast. It is everything you would want in a state. It was semi-progressive, it had forefathers and foremothers that believed in this stuff, and I&#8217;ll be damned, I will be damned, if we, as a group of citizens that care deeply about this state, go down without a fight, and we won&#8217;t. We won&#8217;t. There&#8217;s too many people that now have been activated, and with the advent of social media, with the advent of twenty-four-hour news. This is a movement that&#8217;s being viewed all over the country, if not the world. So keeping the pedal down is important, and showing our moral superiority, that we are right in what we protest about, that this is the right thing to protest about. We have the moral upper hand. They are immoral for doing what they are doing, in all sections of society, in all of our laws, and you name it, it&#8217;s being done to. I think we&#8217;ve been awakened. We took it for granted that Democrats would be there forever and that we were moving in a progressive [direction]. We took it for granted. We got lazy. We got lazy. Now we&#8217;ll pay, for a little bit, and then we&#8217;ll rebuild to a place that I can recognize.
RS: Alright, so tell me, just briefly, about the role in all of this that your new organization, Women AdvaNCe, is going to play. How did you get this idea, what is it, why do you think it&#8217;s important, and how does it connect to this vision you have for the state?
LE: Well, while we were doing Lillian&#8217;s List, I wanted to find a way to educate North Carolinians about issues of the day, political or other issues of the day. Being a PAC [political action committee], you&#8217;re limited to hard money. We just couldn&#8217;t raise enough hard money to go and do that kind of educational work. So for awhile we all wanted to do a (c)3. We just needed to get to a place where we could do a 501(c)3 not-for-profit educational arm of Lillian&#8217;s List. So we&#8217;ve been talking about it, I&#8217;ve been talking about the need for it, and then a year and a half ago Kim[-Marie] Saccoccio, deputy director at Lillian&#8217;s List, said, &#8220;Are you ready to do this?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yes. Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; We formed a working group with Jacquelyn Hall, Rachel Seidman, Destiny Lopez, Diane Morris, Jane Brown, progressive scholars, female scholars from around the university area, [we had] conversations with them and progressive female leaders coming in. And we found that we had hit a nerve, and that to see where we are today is in direct relationship to women staying home in 2010 and 2012. Women stayed home, they just did, and from my electoral work--. Lillian&#8217;s List can&#8217;t do it all, because you can write a bunch of checks and get women into office, but you can&#8217;t make them vote. So to make them vote, they need to know what&#8217;s affecting their lives and they need to know it in the current way that women need to know what&#8217;s affecting their lives. And the best way to do that was [for] this group to come up together and come up with a think tank where it could have part education of health, economy, social welfare, jobs, and taking care of the social needs of the day. And then there&#8217;s an academic, more white paper version of this, that needed to do the truth finding, the academic work, the actual data, fact-driven work that supports the ideas that were coming from a progressive voice to engage people where they are. Now that was sort of the point: what is going on, that women are staying at home or voting not in their best interests? We were dumbfounded, hair on the top of our heads just on fire.   So this group gets to thinking, and social media started playing a role. It was the right place at the right time. The legislature was just wreaking havoc. We had very deliberate, deliberate conversations about how to roll out a website that would incorporate the best parts of websites that we look at to inform, engage, and connect, and possibly activate, people. The woman who&#8217;s rushed her kids off to the bus, grabs her cup of coffee, turns on their computer, and hopefully their first thing that comes up in their email is our Daily Advance post, so you get one page of what you need to know about that day. And you go directly to the website and learn more, and then within that website there are other great documents and great articles that are written that draw your attention to things that directly affect your life and your family&#8217;s life. We&#8217;re not running around talking about somebody, what they&#8217;re wearing on the Academy Awards, or Robin Thicke, and I can&#8217;t remember who that woman is on the stage, basically, you know, fornicating. We&#8217;re actually saying really fact-based things, and it hit like wildfire.   So the connection is Lillian&#8217;s List helps get women into office by finding them, training them, and getting them there and keeping them there. The Lillian&#8217;s List Action Fund helps train them up specifically, with unlimited sources to give them the right tools to become really good, sharp candidates. And then Women AdvaNCe comes along. It was going to be the third arm of Lillian&#8217;s List. We were going to be the three-headed monster, sort of like Civitas has--the antidote to Civitas, if you will--but it got bigger than that, it got broader than that, and it should be consumed by all citizens of North Carolina for the wellbeing of North Carolina. That&#8217;s how it got bigger than just the third arm of this great, moving, all three moving parts together to create this entity. So we called it Women AdvaNCe because, just like it says, to advance the cause of women in North Carolina, and the website has done great things so far. It&#8217;s illuminated issues of the day, it brings in other articles, it cross-posts with other things, it has moving video, it&#8217;s got scholarly work, it&#8217;s got great blogs that we love, it&#8217;s got a Facebook and a [Twitter] account and a Pinterest. These are all social media that is being run by a twenty-two-year-old. And we have these interns called Moxie interns that Rachel Seidman put together over at Duke and carried it over to Carolina, and now we&#8217;ve got this groove that made me believe that we&#8217;re hitting it again, much like my energy around Lillian&#8217;s List when we first started that. It&#8217;s like we are a mosquito and hit a healthy blood vein and it just blew up. We hit it again. The timing was right. If we are fat in the legislature, if we had the governor&#8217;s house, if we had the judiciary, I&#8217;m not sure how connected or yearning or needy we could be, or women could be and their families, but right now we need a voice, and we need to find a way to talk to each other, and we need to not vote this way anymore.   That&#8217;s the connection we&#8217;re trying to promote, and October 15 will be our first way to get face to face with all these great thinkers in North Carolina to come up with shared lives and shared experience and shared professions and shared interests to the end of a goal to leave that day. It&#8217;s a summit called &#8220;Ms. Behavior: How Women Change North Carolina History,&#8221; and we&#8217;ve been doing it since we landed, back in the Lost Colony. We had women all in there, back in the 1490s. But fast forward to 2013; we&#8217;re all going to gather together at the end of the day with possibly some set of goals to move forward and carry out what we came up with that day, and I feel like that group together, that meeting, will say so much, looking in each other&#8217;s eyes, about what we want to do in our hearts and our minds and for our families and for our state. Then we&#8217;ll take off from there.
RS: That&#8217;s a very powerful and optimistic prediction. I hope you are right.
LE: Thank you, thank you.
RS: Is there anything you want to talk about that we haven&#8217;t touched on that you think is important to your story, or to the story of Lillian&#8217;s List, or Women AdvaNCe, or women&#8217;s politics in North Carolina?
LE: I think that what I find and what I hope to find from all of my influences in my life--and there have been a lot of strong women influences. But [we need to reach out to] the male influences as well, who do respect this work and who are into this work, unabashedly and totally supportive. We can&#8217;t do this alone. We can&#8217;t do this alone in our own silos. We can&#8217;t do it without our male counterparts too, or our female counterparts. Our growth is incumbent upon mentors, and I am standing on many shoulders of many women who have done this work long before I have. I&#8217;m in collegial and dynamic relationships with people like yourself, and Jacquelyn Hall, and Jane Brown, and Bev Perdue, and Elaine Marshall, and Jan Allen, who have done this work long before any of us were doing it and really taking chances back in their lives when it wasn&#8217;t very popular. Well, now it&#8217;s necessary, and we cannot stand alone. We need to recognize that we need to honor our past, get with what we need to do for our present, and then bring up the next generation of leaders, and that&#8217;s also what I hope Women AdvaNCe will accomplish, not only through our website and our social media engagement but also our internships and our campus possibility. The Moxie interns we had have a possibility of doing Campus AdvaNCe, and that would be incredible. It really would. If we could get that accomplished somehow that would take fire. I think that would be a magnificent way of keeping everybody engaged, especially here in North Carolina with being shut out of the process on college campuses. But it&#8217;s incumbent upon us presently to engage the youth and bring them up too, and I think, from what I&#8217;ve seen so far in my Moral Monday and Moxie and women&#8217;s groups, that we&#8217;re in good hands.
RS: Alright. Thank you very much.
