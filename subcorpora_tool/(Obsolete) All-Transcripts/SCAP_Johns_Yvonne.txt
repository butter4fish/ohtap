JOHNS:	Do you ask everybody the same questions?

WILLIAMS:	We vary a little bit, especially by class year, but you know, whatever’s interesting, we’ll just kind of go off on.

JOHNS:	Just so you won’t be confused, when I came to Smith from Hawaii, Hawaii was not yet a state.  I mean, that sounds so old.  Statehood happened in 1959.

WILLIAMS:	So were you like an international student?

JOHNS:	No, and most people didn’t get it, so it’s not a dumb question, we were a territory.  So we had been United States citizens ever since the monarchy had been overthrown, yeah.  And since I’ve been writing recently, I’m pretty good on that history, but let’s not get distracted.  (laughs)

WILLIAMS:	We won’t get on it.  Well I’m ready when you are.  Okay, it’s Bethy Williams here with Yvonne Johns, and we’re going to talk about your experience at Smith.  So how did you originally choose Smith?

JOHNS:	I probably started thinking Seven Sisters about end of sophomore year.  I didn’t have anybody in my family who had come to Smith, but it was not unusual for girls going to (unclear) school, even before me, to come east to college.  So it wasn’t some brave new idea, and because I’ve gone to a co-ed school for 12 years, I really wanted a women’s college.  I can remember applying to thinking I wanted to go to Vassar, thinking my first choice was Wellesley, and applying to Smith because my best friend’s mother went to Smith, and Stanford because I had to, but I didn’t want to go there.  When the envelopes came, both the same wait from Wellesley and Smith, I said Smith before I opened them.  I don’t know why, but I’m so glad. (laughs)

WILLIAMS:	So why were you craving that women’s experience — women’s college experience?

JOHNS:	Well I can’t tell you that I was conscious — consciously a woman.  I was a girl and I wanted something different from the co-ed experience I’d had.  I’d like that, but I liked the idea of just being girls, and not being intimidated in the classroom, etcetera, etcetera.

WILLIAMS:	How would you describe a typical Smithie during your time here?

JOHNS:	We were fairly conventional.  We were definitely of our time.  I’d say, we came from primarily Republican parents, and ours was not to upset the status quo.  Nobody I knew sounded rebellious, and I was the number one rule-follower, and I don’t think I was unusual.

WILLIAMS:	So you think you fit into the (unclear)?

JOHNS:	Absolutely.

WILLIAMS:	Do you think you still fit into the (unclear) typical Smithie?

JOHNS:	Yes, because I think the ‘60s liberalized a whole lot of us, and I think the ‘60s were all about women’s — civil rights and women’s issues, and you could see it as the questionnaires happened, you know, that we were becoming pretty darn liberal.

WILLIAMS:	So, during your time at Smith, were you part of any clubs or organizations?

JOHNS:	I think I spent too much time at Wesleyan.  (laughs)

WILLIAMS:	What were you doing at Wesleyan?

JOHNS:	Dating.  (laughter)

WILLIAMS:	Well let’s talk about that.

JOHNS:	I don’t remember belonging to any organizations.  I think I applied, or whatever you did, for Gold Key, and I didn’t get it.  No.

WILLIAMS:	So how were things at Wesleyan, good?

JOHNS:	Well you know, we had men swarming on campus, etcetera, etcetera, and because I came from Hawaii, and because we had the facebook, the printed one, and Hawaii was not yet a state, it was sort of exotic to look up a girl from Hawaii.  I was not the only one in my class, but I know it helped me get blind dates.  So I had a lot of dates.  Lots of curiosity, and I met this young man who was a hockey player, and had come up to play at Amherst, and I was at some sort of fraternity thing at Amherst, I don’t remember which one, and somebody knew I was from Hawaii, and they asked me to do a hula, and I had just enough encouragement out of a bottle to do the hula.  (laughs)  So, that’s how I met him.  And then we got married the day I graduated.

WILLIAMS:	Wow, the day you graduated?

JOHNS:	The day I — the night I graduated.

WILLIAMS:	Was it at Smith?

JOHNS:	Yeah, it was at –

WILLIAMS:	(unclear) Hills?

JOHNS:	No, no, it’s the Episcopal Church down there.

WILLIAMS:	Oh, St. Johns?  Yeah.

JOHNS:	You know, I was just in there for the first time, since I’ve gotten married, and I can’t tell you the name, but I remember the priest’s name who married us.

WILLIAMS:	Wow.  (unclear)  So you went on a lot of dates.  Sounds like you went to some parties during your time there?

JOHNS:	I had an active dating life.  I think I belonged to that cohort which thought that the worst thing was to have to spend a weekend on campus.

WILLIAMS:	So you went out a lot (unclear).

JOHNS:	But I studied very hard.  I’m the one who liked the formula, study hard, play hard.

WILLIAMS:	Right.

JOHNS:	And it worked for me.

WILLIAMS:	Good.  So, what house did you live in?

JOHNS:	Gillett.

WILLIAMS:	And did that play a big role in your Smith experience?

JOHNS:	I love Gillett House, and I was president senior year, and I have continued to get our group together.  So my loyalty is very strong.

WILLIAMS:	And while you were here, did you all — you know, what kind of things did you do?

JOHNS:	They all played bridge.  I resolved that I would not be sidelined by that habit, or temptation.  So that’s one thing that I didn’t spend my time doing.  I spent a lot of time studying.  I studied especially in what in those days we called smokers, rooms set aside or the basement, but we couldn’t smoke in our individual rooms, but I learned to smoke at Smith, because it was sophisticated I thought.

WILLIAMS:	I saw the newspapers too, all the ads were for cigarettes, and appears so many times.

JOHNS:	Well honey, they were 35 cents a pack.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.

JOHNS:	Or maybe 50, I don’t know.

WILLIAMS:	So did you go abroad at all when you were at Smith?

JOHNS:	No, and you know, I’d like to share that with you, because when I was applying, one of the things I thought sounded great was doing a year abroad, but then I met this young man, and we got serious — he was a year ahead of me — fairly quickly, and I forgot all about going abroad.  I did go between our junior and senior years, to Europe, with three friends, but I wasn’t in the study program.

WILLIAMS:	And during your time here, do you think issues of religion, class, sexuality, do you think they were divisive, or –

JOHNS:	What issues?

WILLIAMS:	Like how did race play out?

JOHNS:	We didn’t have –

WILLIAMS:	You didn’t have it?

JOHNS:	We were so oblivious.  Recently, with the observation of the freedom rides, I know that was going on, and given how active I became in the civil rights movement in Chicago, I don’t know why it didn’t grab my attention, on the other hand, I’d grown up in Hawaii, and we didn’t have the conflict of black and white.  We were happy to describe ourselves, and be described by others, as a melting pot.  So, you know, theoretically we got along with everybody.

WILLIAMS:	So you didn’t know about civil rights stuff while you were here, but –

JOHNS:	Well I graduated in 1961.

WILLIAMS:	Right, but you were really involved afterwards in Chicago?

JOHNS:	Yeah.

WILLIAMS:	Can you tell us a little bit more about that?

JOHNS:	Sure.  I have to think in my head.  We moved to Chicago — we were moved there by my husband’s job in 1964.  I was about to have our second child.  We moved into our first house, out of an apartment, the day after Dr. King was shot.  I knew friends who were going already to Operation Breadbasket, in Chicago, started by somebody none of us had ever heard of, Reverend Jesse Jackson, and that was my entrée into the movement, and we became very active in white suburbia assisting Operation Breadbasket in the City of Chicago, in its black neighborhoods, in any way we could, and we produced a newsletter, and paid close attention.  I can remember picketing the A&P, in Winnetka, where we lived.  I can remember picketing another store in downtown Chicago, so once in awhile we used shoe leather to state our point of view.

WILLIAMS:	What was it like being a woman, doing all of those things?

JOHNS:	Well you always were with men, but the women as we did in our more usual activities, you know in those days we were very good volunteers.  We served in our community, even though we weren’t getting paid, we did the business of making things better, where we lived.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah, were you involved with the women’s liberation movement later, at all?

JOHNS:	Yes.  Oh, here’s a Smith connection.  Came back, the first reunion I came back to, was the tenth.  My roommate and I stayed intentionally to hear Gloria Steinem give the commencement address, and each of us then went to graduate school.  I can promise you, when I graduated in ’61, I had no idea of going to graduate school, but in those ten years, the movement had become on I could hear, particularly because of Betty Friedan, and I read her book early on and thought, oh my god, I’ve made a terrible mistake.  I’m going to waste my education just being a wife and mother.  So that was uncomfortable, and my response was to go to the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern, in part because it was just a years program, and I didn’t know while I was there that my interest in news was in reading it, not reporting.  So I never functioned as a journalist, although I reported for Time Magazine in the Chicago bureau, and instead of going into that kind of work, I made my way back to Northwestern where they had a recently established office called the “Program on Women,” and I went there not as an academic, but as a staff member in charge with what they call projects.  So I got my education in women’s history in that job.  It was wonderful.

WILLIAMS:	So it sounds like hearing that speech, from Betty Friedan, marks a turning point for you.

JOHNS:	And also Gloria Steinem.

WILLIAMS:	And Gloria Steinem, right.

JOHNS:	And I think I saw Gloria early on.  She’s only, she’s in the class five years ahead of mine, so she’s apt to be on campus, although not this time, when we’re here.  I don’t know her.  I’d love to know her, I’m a big fan, but yeah she was influential.

WILLIAMS:	And reading The Feminine Mystique, I mean you talked about it a little bit, can you just elaborate a little bit more?

JOHNS:	Sure.  I think I had just had my second child — no her book came out in ’63, yeah so probably the paperback came out in ’64.  That second child was born in April.  My mother-in-law had said to me, you’re going to be bored just taking care of children.  I think she’d been bored.  (laughs)  I wanted to be a mom, and I read the book, and that was the basis of my reaction, I’ve made the wrong choice, I’m wasting my education, although if you read Friedan accurately, that’s not what she was saying.  She was saying, beware of getting to this stage in life, ie. midlife because you have a whole second half of life, what are you going to do with it?  It isn’t enough to be a mother.  But I was too panicked.  (laughs)  I thought she had to do it all at the same time.

WILLIAMS:	And do you think as a Smith graduate, you were expected to, you know, I’ll just be married and have kids, or?

JOHNS:	I think that the institutional generally supports the society, it doesn’t lead it, and I think in my day, the college’s mission was to turn out bright, intelligent women who would be married to bright, intelligent men, and we would be behind the men who were successful.  I think we were sort of the tail-end of that expectation.

WILLIAMS:	But you didn’t want that for yourself, or you –

JOHNS:	Oh.  I wasn’t projecting it at anytime in my young life that I would have a career, beyond raising my kids.  I wasn’t thinking about 25 years down the road.

WILLIAMS:	What was your major, you studied –

JOHNS:	American Studies.

WILLIAMS:	Oh, really?  So you were studying really hard, but you just weren’t thinking about it in terms of a career.

JOHNS:	That’s right.  We were not primed in the way I believe young women are today, to make those — to have that on their minds.  Now, I’m not saying there weren’t women here who didn’t — I’m saying, let’s be clear, there were women here, no doubt, who had other expectations of themselves, but I was very much following the culture of my life in Hawaii, my own parents, and where I wanted to be in a society.

WILLIAMS:	Right.  So, who have you become since Smith?

JOHNS:	Oh, what a great question.

WILLIAMS:	Great question.

JOHNS:	I am privileged and blessed to be able to say to you, that I have become a woman totally comfortable in my own skin.  Yes!  (laughs)

WILLIAMS:	Beautiful answer.

JOHNS:	Thank you.  Wasn’t easy.  That’s what life is about, and I now find myself saying to young women at the ages of my own kids, who are middle aged, you know if you do your homework, and get in touch with your own spirit and voice, it just gets better.

WILLIAMS:	Wow.  (unclear) know what to say.  (laughs)  But it wasn’t easy getting there.

JOHNS:	No.  And my vehicle, it turns out, in hindsight, was 20 years of on and off clinical depression, each one worse than the one before.  I got well without taking medication, and the journalist in me said, after hitting bottom, the journalist in me said, oh my god, at last I have the story to right, and I’ve been writing that.  That’s what impelled me to write biographically — autobiographically.

WILLIAMS:	So you’re writing your own autobiography right now?

JOHNS:	I’ve just finished it.

WILLIAMS:	Oh wow.  It’s going to be published?

JOHNS:	Of course.  Do I know how?  No.  (laughs)  Tune in, oh in another 12 months.

WILLIAMS:	I’d like to read it.

JOHNS:	Good.  Hopefully you’ll be able to.

WILLIAMS:	Do you talk about Smith in it, at all?

JOHNS:	Yes.  Because it really is the chronology of my life, because my theory includes, I believe, the ground is prepared for a person to become depressed when she’s been taught — she or he — has been taught to be dependent, and I think it’s so much more common for us to think we’re independent, but we’re not necessarily independent in all the ways we need to be.

WILLIAMS:	Yeah.  And that sort of ties in with The Feminine Mystique, and all of those –

JOHNS:	Absolutely.  I think my life has been (unclear)  and I’m so glad I was born a female, and could take this journey.  And I adore men.  I was divorced, and that’s in there, and I’ve not remarried, and when I’m on campus at a reunion, and earlier the 40th I’m thinking, who said these husbands can come?  (laughter)

WILLIAMS:	I’ve heard that a lot.

JOHNS:	Have you?

WILLIAMS:	People having the men at reunions.

JOHNS:	Well we weren’t conditioned to it early on, and I missed the reunion classes with all the kids, but we didn’t bring our kids.

WILLIAMS:	So looking back, would you encourage your daughter to go to Smith?

JOHNS:	Well she didn’t.  I don’t think she was interested.  I have hopes for my granddaughter, but she’s 12.

WILLIAMS:	So you want them to?

JOHNS:	I would never say that.  It would please me greatly.

WILLIAMS:	Oh right, sorry.  (unclear)  But you had a great experience, right?

JOHNS:	I did, and for that reason, would want to support anyone else who thought she might like to come to Smith, and I would hope for her that she would have in her own way a wonderful experience.  And you might not have it immediately.  I think I said in a correspondence, just before this reunion, this gathering, my Smith education becomes more a part of me with each passing year.  And I don’t mean I’m carrying a banner, I just mean I appreciate it.  It’s part of me.

WILLIAMS:	How is it part of you?  The confidence, your awareness of yourself?

JOHNS:	I didn’t become confident at Smith.  I had my intelligence validated, but I did not speak up in class.  Finally, all these years later, I have no qualms about offering an opinion, and observation, blah, blah.  I have found my voice.  I didn’t find it at Smith.

WILLIAMS:	You think Smith helped, or inhibit it, maybe?

JOHNS:	That’s a good question, I’ve not thought of it.  To the degree that Smith was serving as part of maintaining the status quo, it was doing what it regarded as its job.  I’m awfully glad it’s remained a women’s institution, because I think that’s important.  I’m glad I had the chance to be in school with women, only women.  I’m not faulting Smith.  I think Smith then, and I then, were products of the time.  If I come to school ten years later, who knows.  But I have no quarrel with my own trajectory, now that it’s behind me.  (laughter)

WILLIAMS:	Well, if you had to guess, what would you say the typical Smithie is like now?

JOHNS:	Well the women I see on campus this weekend, who are my classmates, seem to be all pretty settled in their ways, somewhat secure.  I think the ones who I would want to keep an eye on, are the ones who have been partnered all this time, and who’ve yet to undergo a traumatic loss.  In my case, it was divorce, and loss of any kind can trigger depression, but ultimately it has the potential to trigger growth, it’s up to you.

WILLIAMS:	Right, (unclear).  So what difference has your Smith education meant?

JOHNS:	Well I think it’s made me an educated human being, and I like being an educated human being.  Not being a snob, I don’t mean that.  I mean — well one of the greatest compliments I get is to be described as curious.  That’s who I am, and I will be that until I die.  It has served me very well, and Smith certainly encouraged my curiosity.  And the other thing I got at Smith, but I only appreciated it afterwards, having majored in American studies, ie. an inter-disciplinary major, that’s the way I look at life.  I don’t want to be a specialist.  I want to be able to see the relationships.  So I picked the right major.

WILLIAMS:	Right.  And you think you picked the right school?

JOHNS:	Absolutely.  (laughter)  Was there anything I said to indicate otherwise?  I’m pretty gung-ho.  (laughs)  And when I first moved to Chicago, the Smith clubs were a wonderful way to move into a new town, because right away you could affiliate with people who had a similar experience, and in those days, there weren’t book clubs all over the place, but this Smith club in Chicago, the junior Smith club, had a book club.  That was wonderful.  We read really good books.  (laughs)

WILLIAMS:	And it’s just a good way to move, and know people, and yeah.

JOHNS:	Yeah, and then, the women in those days were responsible for taking care of the social life, so you held your breathe, and hoped that her husband and your husband would like each other, and then all four could go to dinner.  (laughs)

WILLIAMS:	So, sort of a final wrapping it up question, do you have any advice for current or future  Smithies?

JOHNS:	Yeah, go easy on yourselves.  The pressure of society is frightening to me, because it’s probably, in my experience, the single most unhealthy place to be, by virtue of the stresses, the pressures, the expectations we impose, which get internalized really early on in a person’s life, and then you spend a whole lot of years trying to live up to somebody’s idea of what you should be doing, and the test, the challenge is to find out for yourself what you should be doing.

WILLIAMS:	There was one question I forgot to ask, and I think one of these people was an American studies professor, but do you remember the controversy of Smith firing Newton Arvin, Edward Spofford, and Joel Dorius.  Wasn’t one of them in American Studies?

JOHNS:	You know who was?  Dan Aaron, but he wasn’t implicated, but he was their contemporary.

WILLIAMS:	Okay.

JOHNS:	And he chaired, or co-chaired with Arthur Mann, American Studies, I don’t think while I was here, we were alert to that.  I think it sort of broke, after we left, but the reason I smiled was because I stayed with a Smith friend, in the class of ’62, two nights before I came here, and she presented me one of the books that had been given to her about that particular time, and I’m glad I was dumb, and didn’t know that that was going on when it was.  It sounds frightening.

WILLIAMS:	Right.  How do you think you would’ve reacted if you knew?

JOHNS:	I don’t think I could’ve related.  We didn’t know about gender differences.

WILLIAMS:	But now what do you think about it?

JOHNS:	I’d be angry that they, from my brief scanning of the book to remind me, that they invaded personal lives, and that it was — isn’t it wonderful that we’ve progressed from that day to this?  I’m not saying we’re home free, but maybe we’re better than we used to be at recognizing that there is no one right way to be.

WILLIAMS:	Thank you very much.

JOHNS:	I loved it, thank you.

WILLIAMS:	(laughs)  You had fun.

JOHNS:	Oh, I loved it.

WILLIAMS:	You were so hilarious.

JOHNS:	I was so what?

WILLIAMS:	You were funny.  It was fun.  A lot of fun.
