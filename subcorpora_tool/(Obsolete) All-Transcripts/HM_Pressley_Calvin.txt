Story_ID: 192842
Speaker 1: I'd like to ask you about your mother.  And if you could state her name and what you know about her background.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Pansy, P-a-n-s-y; Cooper, C-o-o-p-e-r; Pressley, P-r-e-s-s-l-e-y.  My mother came to New York [New York] in 1927 from rural South Carolina, from a short line, because at that time, it was a short line of educators.  My grandfather [Calvin Cooper] and my grandmother [Carie L. Cooper] ran the one-room schoolhouse in Williamsburg County in a little community called Coopers and Brothers, named after the slave owners and that, whose name they also bear, Coopers.  She was born at a time in the south when there was some optimism about African Americans taking their place in, in at least rural South Carolina society.  And my grandmother and grandfather made every effort to make sure that all of their children, my mother, as well as the rest of their siblings, got at least a normal education, and when I say normal education, normal education was two years of college.  As a matter of fact, my mother and all her siblings, save the baby boy, went to Avery Normal [Institute] in Charleston [South Carolina].  So they left rural South Carolina to go to Charleston to go to what was then considered private school.  And she--after she graduated from Avery Normal, she went back to her community to teach.  She was a teacher at the Brown Memorial High School in Nesmith, South Carolina.  When she and my father [George Washington Pressley], that's a longer story and I'm sure we'll get into that, perhaps it's an added dimension.  When she came to New York, she passed the written test to teach for the [New York] Board of Education 'cause she had had additional credit, but at that time, they discriminated against African Americans on the oral exam.  On the oral exam, you could say that people didn't speak well, and therefore, couldn't be put in front of children.  And so she spent some time in what was then the daycare program, the early childhood education program, when she did work; but most of the time, she was a homemaker.
Story_ID: 192843
Speaker 1: Did she [Pressley's mother, Pansy Cooper Pressley] talk about her growing up there [South Carolina]?  You know, any stories like that about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I think that there--when she grew up in, in rural South Carolina, this was prior to The [Great] Depression.  I got the impression that they had about everything they needed to survive as a particular leadership group in that community, and they were very much a part of the leadership of, of that community.  She felt that family was critical, church was important to the development of family, and that these values got passed onto her children.
Speaker 1: Now, how would you describe your mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley]?  What kind of person was she?
Speaker 2: Well, that might take all day because I was a momma's boy.  I am the third biological child.  Now, when I say biological child, we have--my oldest sister is not legally adopted because she's my uncle's eldest daughter, but when I came into the world, Francine was there, so we consider her a sister.  Then I have a brother, George [Pressley]; a sister, Lois [Pressley]; and I was the third child, but then there are three more that followed; Alex [Pressley], Raymond [Pressley], and Pansy [Pressley], okay?  But back to, to, to my mother, they said that here's a term that you won't know, that I was the yellin' baby for a long time.  The yellin' baby is the baby who cries when anybody else comes into the picture, so that is the relationship.  I was fairly close to her coattails until my next brother, who is eight years, my junior, came around, and that was a kind of traumatic experience for me.  But my mother and I were very close, and, and I essentially--I think became kind of a--the lightning rod for the, for the family operation.
Speaker 1: But what kind of person was she?  And--
Speaker 2: My mother was--well, let me, let me put it this way.  When we buried her, there was a line in a hymn that I used to describe her, and it is, it's changed from glory into glory.  And she was the kind of mother that I put on a pedestal, and I was sure that the Lord would receive her in that way.  My family--I think for people struggling in New York [New York] were unusual.  There was nothing that they felt was in our interest that they didn't try to achieve for us.  And my mother was, was central to that because she was the manager.  She managed the household.  My father [George Washington Pressley] was a very strong figure, but my mother managed the household.
Story_ID: 192844
Speaker 1: Now, what about your father [George Washington Pressley]?
Speaker 2: My father--
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: Well, it depends on which week you wanted to call his name because he was named after [President] George Washington, okay?  But sometimes we called him Washington George.  So I can spell it both ways, if you'd like, but his official name was George Washington Pressley.  They came from the same community in rural South Carolina.  His father [Alex Pressley] was an entrepreneur.  He--and a lot of people don't know this, but during the early 1900s, African Americans ran businesses, etc., in the rural south.  He ran the--he owned the little cotton gin, and he also had a, a store, and it wasn't 'till The [Great] Depression that he lost his land, the cotton gin, and the store; this is my grandfather.  My father was the third child of six, and he went through eleventh grade in high school, and then the Depression started earlier in the south than it did in some places.  He had to leave his father's farm.  His father was about to lose it.  And he went to Florida to work in the orange groves, and stuff, trying to make a living to send money back to help support his family.  That didn't work too well, so he came back, married my mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley], and then they moved to New York [New York].
Story_ID: 192845
Speaker 1: Did he [Pressley's father, George Washington Pressley]--he knew your mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley] from childhood, is that how--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were childhood friends.  He's--was about six years older, but he knew her from childhood.  He--my father, in New York [New York], ran his own business.  He was the community cobbler.  He was a shoe repairman.  And he also worked for the Lehigh Valley Railroad.  My father would get up at six o'clock in the morning, go and open his shoe repair stop--shop, take in shoes, okay?  Leave at eight-thirty, go to work for the Lehigh Val--Valley Railroad unloading freight until five o'clock.  He would come back and he would work in his shop from five-thirty to ten o'clock at night repairing shoes, and people would, would rotate in and out collecting their shoes.  He worked for the Lehigh Valley Railroad for thirty-seven years straight, okay?  My father was, as I suggested earlier in talking about my mother, a very determined and dedicated father.  I don't remember him doing anything ever but working and going to church.  He would--after he'd come in at ten o'clock at night, he'd take his bus--he'd take his money out, put it on the desk--on, on the dresser, go take his shower, go to bed, and get up the next morning and repeat that.  But we were all very close to him and never doubted for a minute that he loved and cared about us.
Story_ID: 192846
Speaker 1: Now, do you know why your parents [George Washington Pressley and Pansy Cooper Pressley] moved to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Sure.  They were looking for economic opportunity, okay?  They knew that if they could go to New York, somebody told them that there was opportunity there.  They could help support the families that they left in South Carolina.  And let me give you an example of, of what I mean.  But let me say first, that it wasn't the intention of going to New York.  My father [George Washington Pressley] had an older brother [Oliver Pressley] who had left to do the same thing, to go north to find opportunity and to support the family and the farm and try to maintain the farm, but he was in York, Pennsylvania.  When my father went to the railroad depot in Kingstree, South Carolina, and asked him for a ticket to York, Pennsylvania, the man told him, "Boy, you don't know where you're going."  He says, "You need--you mean, you want to go to New York."  So my father did not know he--where he was going, and he bought a ticket to New York, and he arrived at Penn Station [Pennsylvania Station, New York, New York] and went up and down the street looking for my Uncle Oliver [Pressley], whose middle name I--who's my middle name, and he couldn't find him around Penn Station.  And some man told him, "Oh, the black folk live uptown.  Go on uptown and you ask about Oliver."  Well, my Oli--my Uncle Oliver was in York, Pennsylvania and not in New York, and so he had to find his way in New York City, but was a very aggressive entrepreneurial type, and he made his way.  My mother did not come with him.  He sent for her, oh, about a year-and-a-half later.
Story_ID: 192847
Speaker 1: Now, your--you were born--where, were you born?  In New York [New York] or--
Speaker 2: Oh, I and all of my siblings, my biological siblings--
Speaker 1: Were born--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --were born in New York.
Speaker 1: --in New York.  Okay.  And where did your, where did your parents [George Washington Pressley and Pansy Cooper Pressley] settle in New York when they moved?
Speaker 2: On 120th Street and Madison Avenue [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And is that--
Speaker 2: No, that was the second settlement.  The first settlement was they--there was a woman--when my father [George Washington Pressley] was looking for my uncle [Oliver Pressley], there was a woman who rented rooms, and her name was Sister Armfield [ph.], and she reluctantly, rented a room to my father because my father was dark skinned, and she said he had grease in his hair, and she wasn't sure that she wanted her sheets messed up, but he convinced her that, that, that he was a clean black man, and therefore, he agreed.  So when my mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley] came up--she agreed.  When my mother came up, she said, "Well, you can stay here too, if you go to church with me."  So that's how they first settled in.  Then they moved to 120th Street and Madison Avenue.  And then to 128th Street, between Madison [Avenue] and Fifth [Avenue].  When my wife [Iona Pressley] and I were courting, I told her I lived on Fifth Avenue, and that's true.  She was from Nebraska, so she didn't know any better.  But anyway, Fifth Avenue way uptown.  But ultimately, I took her way downtown on Fifth Avenue.
Story_ID: 192848
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Calvin] Pressley, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  My earliest memory of growing up would, would really be in elementary school, okay?  My sisters and my brothers were great students, and I had a cousin, and that's a--another story, who was my contemporary, my age, and they were great students, and they kind of led me through the public school that was in our front door, but I could not read until I was in third grade.  And there was one teacher, her name was Mrs. Gundles [ph.], an African American teacher, and I had special reading attention; when I left elementary school.  I was reading on the college level, so I remember that distinctly.  I also remember not accepting the reality that my mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley] was pregnant with my brother who is eight years, my junior, so we told everybody he was going to be a girl, and the teachers, they laughed when they discovered he was a boy.  They bought rattles and all kinds of things for, for Alex [Pressley], who was--they thought was Alexandria.  But anyway, those are the, the memories.  Then we had, we had a very tight knit block.  People think about the lack of intimacy in the city, but 128th Street [New York, New York], between Madison and Fifth Avenue, was a combination of brownstones and, and apartment buildings, but the children--we had a lot of children in the block.  Very tightknit.  We played a lot, fought a lot, okay?  But not violent fights, just stuff that kids do.
Speaker 1: Can you describe your block?  I mean, you know, some of the people who were on the block, who lived on the block.  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The block was kind of anchored by the, the Pressleys, the Bunyons [ph.], and the Watermans [ph.], okay?  Now, the Pressleys, out of that group, they were the only family from the rural south; the Bunyons and the Watermans, they were from the Caribbean, but they, they--but those families represented the anchors.  Now, they weren't the only families, but they represented the anchors.  And we--oh, everybody was working class, clearly, and, you know, and everybody got up and, and went to work except the number runners and the dope dealers.  They didn't go to work, but we knew who they were.  But until the late '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s], they never sold drugs on the block.  It was always something that they did--and I think of a, a particular family, the Cowens, [ph.] they lived--the anchored the other end of the block, but everybody knew that, that they were into illegal activity.  We had a candy store on the corner where we spent a lot of time.  That's where everybody did their numbers, you know, the policy numbers, but everybody knew it.  And the police knew it, but it was a part of, of growing up on 128th Street.  It was--
Speaker 1: The Cow--Cowens, [ph.] were they black?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.  And then there was a Charlie's Grocery Store, and Charlie sold high and cheap, but he was there.
Speaker 1: You know, am I--the, the, the--were there any differences in the--between the, you know, the Bunyons [ph.] and the Sugarmans [sic, Watermans] who were the Caribbean, where were they from?  Were they from Jamaica, do you know?
Speaker 2: Jamaica and Barbados.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any differences in their--you know, in their family structure?  'Cause Deep South--
Speaker 2: We didn't, we didn't detect it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If there were, we didn't detect it.  We--and we really knew they were Caribbean, but it did--it didn't really make a difference when we were growing up.
Story_ID: 192849
Speaker 1: I want to take you back to that block [128th Street, between Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue, New York, New York] in--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --those early years, and I'd like you to describe for me what sights, smells, and/or sounds remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Peas and rice, okay?  Roast pork; collard greens; fish.  Skating, sounds of skates 'cause we were--our block, we had the best skaters on the--in, in the region.  Roller skates.  Those are the things that come to mind.
Speaker 1: No pigs feet? (Laughter.)
Speaker 2: No.  Pig feet is a southern thing that--they were easy to get in New York [New York], okay, but while I liked them, we didn't eat them that much.
Speaker 1: What about sights?
Speaker 2: School.  We lived at 19 East, and the school, P.S. 24, was right in front of it.  I couldn't come out of the door and not see the school.  Brownstones.  Had a lot of brownstones.  We had one white family that refused to move.  They lived right next to our apartment building in a, almost Victorian style wooden house.  That house is still there.  But they refused to move during the, the--you see, what happened, when my parents moved in, in 19 East 128th Street, white people were moving out and black people were moving in.  As a matter of fact, the person that they got the apartment from, she lived with us.  She was white.  She was old.  She lived with us for about six years, okay, because she had no place to go until she died.
Speaker 1: Do you know what the arrangement for your parents' [George Washington Pressley and Pansy Cooper Pressley] buy?  Was it on contract?  You know, there--that was sort of popular back, then, but--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was an outright sale?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I just want to make sure--with your--you played a lot on the block--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you said?  And so you had--were your friends from the block?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not all of them, but you could almost draw a circle for three blocks and hit all of your friends.
Speaker 1: And what--in school, you said that you--your sisters, right?  Sis, sister [Lois Pressley] and brother [George Pressley]--
Speaker 2: Sister and brother.
Speaker 1: --had already been proceeded you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They were better students, do I understand it, at the beginning?
Speaker 2: They performed better.  I could've been a good student, but I would--I did--didn't--let me tell, tell you because this is a dimension that I left off.  When my mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley] and father [George Washington Pressley] came to New York, they were followed by his first cousin, okay, and my mother's sister, who got married.  So we had--and on 120th Street, they lived together, okay?  My uncle was a chef cook for Patricia Mayer Murphy's [ph.], and his wife did domestic work, but they had their children the same time.  I have a cousin, Calvin Purcell Pressley, that's my brother's age.  I have a cousin, Edith Pressley that's my sister's age, the exact--within days.  And Beverly [Pressley], she was born in August and I was born in November.  Now, Beverly was probably the best student, and they kept comparing me to Beverly.  But--and they, they knew we weren't sisters and brothers, but they, they had all gone through and so that was the kind of academic pressure that was placed on me.
Story_ID: 192850
Speaker 1: Now, what were you like as a little boy?
Speaker 2: A brat.  That's the easiest way to describe it.  If my sister [Lois Pressley] walked in the door, that's just what she would say, okay?  Because they say I'd tell on them for every little thing they did, okay?  But I suppose there, there, there was some aspects of that are true.
Speaker 1: So were you, besides being a brat (laughter), so you were sort of a all--you know, you were--were you--you were a tattletale, and you were a momma's boy, you didn't want any other kids taking attention away from you.  You were like a youngest child.
Speaker 2: For the longest time I was, for eight years.  Yes, I was the baby for eight years.
Speaker 1: So then that's why you have those characteristics then (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's, that's, that's part of it.  Ask my wife [Iona Pressley] (laughter).
Story_ID: 192851
Speaker 1: Now, so, so let--beside, now you said there was this Mrs. Gungles?
Speaker 2: Gundles.
Speaker 1: Gundles?  Okay.
Speaker 2: G-U-N-D-L-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Gundles.  And tell me, can you just describe her and why she had an influence in you in that way?
Speaker 2: She was a matronly woman.  She looked at me and she told me, she says, "You know, you're better than what you think you are, and you ought to act better than you think you are."  And she gave me personal attention and I responded to her.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so what was she doing?  Was she giving--
Speaker 2: She was the reading specialist.
Speaker 1: So she gave you special assignments and worked with you?
Speaker 2: In reading, yes.
Speaker 1: I was always good in math, so that wasn't a problem, but reading was a problem.  Let me tell you about Public School 24.  It was one of the first experiments in special education.  When I say special education, it was considered a more effective school, okay?  In the '40s [1940s] in New York City [New York], you probably had six African American principals, we had one at Public School 24, and we had four African American teachers, okay?  And the school had a very good reputation.  And the students, you know, did well, and many of them--give you a better example.  Beverly [Pressley] left P.S. 24 [Public School] and went directly to Hunter [College High School, New York, New York], which was the experimental high school, okay?  You test in and you, you got on.  Arcor Dodds, [ph.] he went and left and went--well, he went to Cooper [Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] first, but went--then went to Stuyvesant [High School, New York, New York], okay?  Now, am I giving you the impression that all of the kids went to special high schools?  No.  But certainly, about five percent of the class who went through the academically were prepared to work anywhere, anyplace.  Arcor [ph.] later went onto Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and then to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and law school, but I just am giving an example.
Speaker 2: And what--why do you think that that was--when you say that it was a first experiment in special education, was this--are you saying that that was intentional?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was, it was an organized effort.  There was a book on, on the subject.  I used to have it in my library, but I don't have it anymore.
Speaker 2: And with--
Speaker 1: It even mentions me.
Speaker 2: It does?
Speaker 1: It does, but I--I've--I don't know what the title is.
Speaker 2: As an example of students who went through?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Huh.  And were there other things influencing you, you know, during the--you know, in school besides Mrs. Gund--Gungles--Gundles.
Speaker 1: Gundles.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Mr. Williams [ph.] and Ms. Harris [ph.].
Story_ID: 192852
Speaker 1: I mean, the brownstones, were they kind of, you know--
Speaker 2: No, we lived in an apartment building.
Speaker 1: Oh, you lived--okay.
Speaker 2: The brownstones--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --some of them were single-family, some of them had other people in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I see.  Okay.  Has there been a lot of change to that block?  You said--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sad, yeah.  Lots of deterioration, but that, that block really needed to have been gentrified, and it hasn't been.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you think that'll happen now, with the changes?  But the changes are occurring a little south still, right?
Speaker 2: No, west.
Speaker 1: West?  Okay.
Speaker 2: West.
Story_ID: 192853
Speaker 1: Now, so we were talking about--you, you were talking about Mr. Williams.
Speaker 2: Oh, Mr. Williams.  Mr. Williams, I'm not sure you're familiar with the tracking system of, of public schools; particularly, New York City [New York] public schools, okay?  And the tracking system has a number track, okay?  It would be, for example, grade 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4, etc., and all of the best students would be in 5-1, okay?  If you were a good student, you couldn't get out of P.S. 24 [Public School] without taking Mr. Williams in 5-1, and you couldn't get out without taking Ms. Harris in 6-1.  It was K [Kindergarten] through sixth before you went to junior high school.  When you went to junior high school, they already knew whether you were going to get in an academic track or a vocational track because you had to make a language selection.  And if you were--if you selected French, you went to 7-1; if you selected Spanish, you went to 7-2, and the rest were vocational tracks because you needed a language to go to high school at an academic school.  At the time I went to, to, to school in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: And so where were you on the track?
Speaker 2: I was in the 1 class.
Speaker 1: So you--so Mrs. Gungles, [sic, Gundles] she--
Speaker 2: Oh, Ms. Gundles was the world.
Speaker 1: She did right by you.
Speaker 2: The world of difference.
Speaker 1: Huh.  And so once the world of reading opened up to you, you had--as you said, you had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --math, and so that made--okay, that, that's--now, so, but you--describe Mr. Williams and what influence he had.
Speaker 2: Mr. Williams was a very erect, dignified, gentle person, but strict; very strict, okay?  And he used to make demands on what he felt were his best students, and lots of demands, you know, from doing extra homework to carrying his briefcase.  You know, we'd have to bring his briefcase down from the fifth floor to the bus stop (laughter).  You know, he--you'd be walking by--
Speaker 1: But that was an honor, though?
Speaker 2: Well, some--somewhat of an honor.  But a person like me, it was an honor for some, I used to resent it (laughter).  But I had to do it.  Yeah.  And you see, part of the, the, the, the early thing, it--while the reading opened up, the conduct problem didn't because you acted out your insecurities.  So I used to have to have a conduct book where they--you know, where they grade you quarterly, I had to be graded daily, to take it home so that my parents could see that I was performing 'cause my mother--everybody knew her.  I mean, she lived right in the, in the school door.  So I'd take my conduct book home.  So I used to get merits or demerits for doing Mr. Williams' work.
Speaker 1: So what would you do in class?
Speaker 2: Misbehave.
Speaker 1: Laugh?  Joke?
Speaker 2: Anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, not, not necessarily disruptive, but, you know, some people would've said I was a troubled kid.  Let me tell you, they would've probably put me on Ritalin today.
Speaker 1: So what did Mr. Williams teach you, though?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there was general, and when I say general--
Speaker 1: No, but I'm saying--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --common branches.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)--teach, teach you about life or whatever--because you said he had an influence.
Speaker 2: He did.  He did.  Respect about your person.  He was very meticulous, okay, and I think he taught that.
Speaker 1: And was there another teacher you had al--
Speaker 2: Ms. Harris, okay?  And she was an African American woman.  Very strict.  Okay.  But her students all did well.
Speaker 1: And she was in sixth--
Speaker 2: Sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Sixth grade?  Okay.  So you are at the end of--
Speaker 2: 1949.
Speaker 1: 1949.  And, and you're doing well, but you're still--you've got a mischievous side, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you're doing well?  Okay.

Speaker 1: And are there other things influencing you, in terms of, you know, anyone else in the community?  Anything at home?  Any anecdotes about, you know, family, like whether it be vacations, or, you know, holidays, or just regular sort of home life and--
Speaker 2: Well, you could call them vacations, if you want to, okay?  But from the 1st of July to Labor Day, my parents [George Washington Pressley and Pansy Cooper Pressley] would pack my mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley] up, and we would be shipped to rural South Carolina, okay?  So the--and I, I can't remember a year that we didn't go until I was fourteen, okay?  So you had that summer influence.  Now, it wasn't a vacation because we went, when I was old enough to, to remember, to help my gra--grandfather [Calvin Cooper], who was a teacher farmer.  Put in tobacco, pick garden, pick beans, break corn, okay.  All of the things that farm children do, I know how to do, okay?  So that was very much a part of our growth and development.
Speaker 1: And that taught a lot about work ethic?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: So the, the difference, in terms of, you know, being raised in the city, you know, but on a nei--a neighborhood block, and then, you know, spending your summers in the rural south, what was that sort of that, that like?  Or was it--
Speaker 2: It was--I came to resent having to do it, okay?  Now, when did I start resenting it?  I was a fairly decent athlete, okay?  And the summer baseball programs, we'd get started in May, and I'd have to leave, okay?  So, I mean, we won the championship, my team, one year, and I wasn't there because they had, they had to leave to, to go to do that, okay?  So that was a part of it.  It kind of brought separation between my friends and I for two months.
Story_ID: 192855
Speaker 1: Now, when, when you went to seventh grade, what school was it, at that point?
Speaker 2: James Fenimore Cooper [Junior High School, New York, New York], okay?  And that was on 120th Street and Madison Avenue [New York, New York]; between Madison [Avenue] and 5th [Avenue].
Speaker 1: So it's just eighth--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it was just a straight run.  Yeah.  And that was an interesting thing.  As I told you, I was in the, the track 7-1, took French, but started picking up bad habits then.  When I said bad habits, a friend of mine who had gone--we lived in the same apartment building, a friend of mine who had gone to [James Fenimore] Cooper [Junior High School, New York, New York] the year before said, "You have to smoke," okay?  So we would, would stop at the corner at Stedman's Candy Store and buy a pack of cigarettes.  He'd take half and I'd take half.  And we'd smoke half on the way to school and half back, okay?  And you know, that was, was not all of it, but yeah.  And until--so that was seventh and, and 8th grade.  And, you know, I learned some very good things at, at Cooper.  We had a culinary arts program.  It was a, a great school, okay?  But the attitude problems came back, okay?  So the first time my parents sent me south to go to school for the full year was in ninth grade, okay?  They figured I needed an attitude adjustment, and it, it worked a little, okay, but it didn't work completely, because I finished my senior year in high school [Tomlinson High School, Kingstree, South Carolina] in rural South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you went for ninth grade, came back to New York [New York]--
Speaker 2: For twelfth grade, yeah, and--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Back to New York--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --came back to New York.
Speaker 1: --for two years--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And then went--
Speaker 1: --and then went back?  So, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were, you were finding yourself, sort of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as a person?  And you don't--
Speaker 2: Well, they were finding me, one of the two.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  (Laughter).  And you didn't really want to be constrained too much?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Or told much what to do. (Laughter.)
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are your--how are your grades?  Are they up and down or are they consistent?
Speaker 2: They up and down.  They're consistent when I want to be; well, when they have to be, okay?  And when I didn't like something, or didn't like the particular person, they were, were, were not good, but I think that everybody agreed that I had the intellectual ability to do it.  And so--and then there was another dimension to this attitude adjustment within my church and my pastor, who, who again, was another Ms. Gundles in this whole equation of things.
Story_ID: 192856
Speaker 1: Now, what denomination did you--were you raised?
Speaker 2: United Methodist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, let me tell you about this.
Speaker 1: But for, for--and, and were your parents [George Washington Pressley and Pansy Cooper Pressley] United Methodist?
Speaker 2: When my parents came to New York [New York], they were United Methodist.  They've Methodist for generations.  My grandfather and his father were [United] Methodist.  When they came to New York, my father [George Washington Pressley] was--joined the Salem [United Methodist Church, New York, New York].  It was AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church then, but it's now United Methodist, which is what the church has grown to.  But my mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley] started going to church with this Sister Armfield [ph.], who she used to room with, and they were Pentecostal, okay?  Now, I went to church with both of them until I was twelve-years-old, and the Pentecostal church, after you're twelve-years-old, you're responsible for your own soul, so I stopped going, okay?  And at, at that time, Reverend [Dr.] William [M.] James, who had been my early childhood director at the Mount Calvary Nursery School, returned from the Bronx [New York, New York] to the Metropolitan Community [United Methodist] Church in Harlem [New York, New York], okay, which was 126th [Street] and Madison Avenue [New York, New York], and then started to become the hound of Heaven for my soul.  And he was very, very effective.  I mean, you know, people used to tease me that, that--and even in elementary school, "Oh, you can't read, but you memorize all the plays."  I was a--I performed in everything.
Story_ID: 192857
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were active in theat--besides--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --sports, you, you were active in theater?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, my mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley]--
Speaker 1: Starting when?
Speaker 2: Oh, second grade.  And all of my siblings [George, Lois, Alex, Raymond and Pansy Pressley] had to take music, as well.  I'm supposed to know how to play the violin, but I can't, but I took it from the time I was in second grade until I was in eighth grade, okay?  So, I mean, all of these enhancements my family tried to provide for us.
Speaker 1: And sports, you said it was track always, or was it--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't track.
Speaker 1: Baseball.  Baseball.
Speaker 2: It was baseball.
Speaker 1: Baseball.  That's right.
Speaker 2: But you play everything when you're little.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But baseball, track.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you play--continue to play during high school [Tomlinson High School, South Carolina, Kingstree, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  On teams?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I ran track.  And when I went back to South Carolina, played basketball and football.  They didn't have track there.
Speaker 1: And your--were you, were you particularly good?
Speaker 2: I was fair, okay?  I wasn't good.  Now, remember, that's a relative judgment.  My church team, when I was a teenager, had two All Americans on it, ultimately.  Calvin Ramsey was an All American at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], and Tom "Satch" Sanders, who played for many years for the Boston Celtics [Boston, Massachusetts].  We are contemporaries.  We grew up together in the--on the church's team.  So you get a quick divide early.
Story_ID: 192858
Speaker 1: So, so you were going to--age twelve, you stopped going to the Pentecostal Church?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  With Sister Armfield [ph.] and your mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley].  Your mother's going between both?
Speaker 2: No, she never went there.
Speaker 1: She's--
Speaker 2: She had, she had become fully Pentecostal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, she became fully Pentecostal?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that didn't last forever because the, the, the preacher ran her out, and she became Methodist again, but that's a much longer story.
Speaker 1: Now, so, with--so you--are you, are you saying from twelve on, you were then going to the United Methodist Church with Reverend--
Speaker 2: That's, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was--when--what age did he come--did he move there, and Reverend--
Speaker 2: When I was about thirteen.
Speaker 1: Thirteen?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So this is when you're right in your--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, in your teenage years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did they have any youth programs at the church?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Reverend [Dr. William M.] James has probably sent five hundred kids to college, if he sent one, all over the country because of his strong commitment to youth ministry.
Speaker 1: And can you tell a little bit about the history of the United Methodist Church?  Just--and how your parents [George Washington Pressley and Pansy Cooper Pressley], you said that they weren't--so they weren't Baptist?
Speaker 2: No, they were not Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The United Methodist Church--well, the Methodist Church was started by John and Charles Wesley, okay, who were a part of the Holy Club of England, okay?  And they came to the United States, Georgia first, as missionaries, essentially, trying to convince the people that are certain methodology of studying worship, brought full spirituality and religious development, okay?  The growth of the church in this country happened with Bishop [Francis] Asbury, who started the, the frontier movement and the Methodist Church, as a spiritual movement, moved all across the, the country, but that's a subject in itself.  But anyway, we have had certain divisions in the church over the racial issue.  The Methodist Church North and the Methodist Church South separated over race.  Did not come back together again until '39 [1939] when they established a separate central jurisdiction, as a plan of merger, where all of the black congregations were now joined.  It didn't change again until 1968.  Yeah, '64 [1964], '68 [1968] when all of the United Methodist Churches that were in a geographical area became members of the annual conference and the jurisdiction, with the exception of New York City [New York], Manhattan [New York, New York], in particular.  The Metropolitan Community [United Methodist] Church [Harlem, New York, New York], the Salem Community [United Methodist] Church [Harlem, New York, New York], St. Mark's [United Methodist Church, Harlem, New York, New York] and Mount Calvary [United Methodist Church, Harlem, New York, New York] were never a part of the central jurisdiction, they were always a part of the, of the Northeastern jurisdiction.  And my church, Metropolitan Community Church, the church I grew up in from twelve, okay, was never a part of the segregated church, as such.
Speaker 1: So when you say, "they were never part of the segregated church, as such," you're saying there were mixed congregation?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: The congregations were all black, okay?  But the--you--the denominations, okay, were structurally segregated by congregations, okay?  You have very little racial mix in, even today, in congregations, local congregations.
Speaker 1: Right.  But you're saying the church structure never separated.
Speaker 2: No, they were never in a separate structure.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.  Then that--but that's the case with a lot of other denominations and black churches.  That's right.
Speaker 2: That's, that's true.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I see.  Okay.  Now, the belief structure though, with United Methodist [Church], 'cause you know, AME [African Methodist Episcopal Church] is, you know, that sort of--okay.
Speaker 2: But they're all offshoots of the--
Speaker 1: Of the same--
Speaker 2: --Methodist Church.
Speaker 1: --of the Methodist Church, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.  And their belief structures were parallel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, they--those denominations got started as racial protests against the Methodist Church segregated position.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 192859
Speaker 1: Now, you are in--okay, so you--you're in high school [Tomlinson High School, Kingstree, South Carolina], you--well, ninth grade, you're down south, you're back for two years--
Speaker 2: Then I go back down south.
Speaker 1: And--well, you were enjoying your two years back?
Speaker 2: Yeah, too much.
Speaker 1: So you go back, you're banished back?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you end that year, and are--you're living with your [maternal] grandparents [Calvin Cooper and Carie L. Cooper]?
Speaker 2: Living with them, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very much so, with my grandparents.
Speaker 1: And so your grandfather [Calvin Cooper], what influence is he having on you?  Is he, you know, he--does he consider you totally sort of spoiled, and you know, he has to sort of make a man out of you?  Or is he, is he sort of--
Speaker 2: He may have considered me spoiled, but he knew I wasn't going to be spoiled with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?  Because he was that kind of person.  He didn't tolerate that, okay?  Nor did my grandmother [Carie L. Cooper], okay?  Now, I told you, they were still teaching at the time, in the, in the rural--they had two-room schoolhouse, okay?  But they had taught everybody in the community.  I think that the most important thing that happened in that experience, okay, was that, that they would tell me, daily, that you're a Cooper.  Now, I don't have Cooper in my name, and Coopers don't act that way, okay?  And it finally sunk in that there were expectations that, that I had to meet.
Story_ID: 192860
Speaker 1: So it's time for you to graduate, what are you wanting to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I always knew I had to go to college 'cause all my, you know, siblings [older siblings, George and Lois Pressley] had gone to college.
Speaker 1: Now, where were you siblings, at this point?  Where were they?
Speaker 2: Well, remember, they're older.  My adopted sister, she's already out; she went to South Carolina State.  My brother, who also went to, to school in, in, in South Carolina to avoid the gangs, okay?  But it wasn't his attitude or his behavior.  My parents [George Washington Pressley and Pansy Cooper Pressley] were just protecting him from the gangs, and he graduated early from Tomlinson High School in, in Kingstree [South Carolina], and went to Allen [University] in Columbia, South Carolina at fifteen, and the next year, he transferred to Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] and went to Howard.
Speaker 1: Early admission?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, early admission is a very different thing now--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --than it was then.  He--
Speaker 1: But he was young?
Speaker 2: He was young.  He was--
Speaker 1: He was young.
Speaker 2: --sixteen when he went to Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, now, what are you looking at?  Are you--
Speaker 2: I'm looking at going to college, but not knowing what I want to do.
Story_ID: 192861
Speaker 1: How did you end up at Drake [University, Des Moines, Iowa], though?
Speaker 2: Reverend [Dr. William M.] James, okay?  Reverend James called up Dr. Miller and told him, "I have this young man, okay, who is ready for a quality college experience.  You take him."  That's how I got to the seminary too. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: So this--you go off to Iowa, this is totally--I mean, I knew you've, you've been going to rural--
Speaker 2: I've been going places.
Speaker 1: Right, you've been going places--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but you haven't been to Iowa before?
Speaker 2: I hadn't been to Iowa.
Speaker 1: So how--and, and what are you--so Reverend James--you--you're looking up to him, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or he's at least directing you.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, I didn't go to Iowa first.  Well, you, you got a long journey with me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --okay?  I went to City College [of New York, New York, New York] first, okay?  But I went to City College as a non-matriculating student, okay?  And my--when I say non-matriculating student, just took--oh, I guess I, I took fifteen hours, but I spent more time in the cafeteria than I spent going to school, okay?  But I'm a good whisk player.
Speaker 1: And this--(laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  So they said they had to get me out.
Speaker 1: Oh, right.  That's right.  Now, how--
Speaker 2: New York, New York's a bad influence.
Speaker 1: Right.  I understand.  And how long were you at--did you go to City College, for a year?  Or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, for, for a year, then from '50 [1950]--from September '54 [1954], 'cause I graduated high school [Tomlinson High School, Kingstree, South Carolina] in '54 [1954] to, to, to June, okay?  Okay.  Then I went to work for the Board of Missions [United Methodist Board of Global Ministries].  When I say I went to work, I was a summer intern for the Board of Missions, okay?  And after that summer intern, went to junior college in Colorado.
Speaker 1: So you went from--wait a minute.  You went City College to the Board of--
Speaker 2: [United Methodist] Board of Global Ministries.
Speaker 1: Okay, the Board--
Speaker 2: Of our church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: As a summer intern.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was in Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: That, that was in--
Speaker 1: Colorado.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: That was in--
Speaker 1: That was Colorado.
Speaker 2: That was in Cleveland [Ohio], then I went to Colorado.
Speaker 1: Oh, you--okay.  So this is all during the summer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This is the church work and it's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --working its magic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I see.  And then so you get--so then you go from, from Cleveland, Colorado, to--
Speaker 2: Drake.
Speaker 1: To Drake.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 192862
Speaker 1: And at Drake [University, Des Moines, Iowa], now, are you still considered a freshman at Drake or--
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)--are you--you're a soph--
Speaker 2: I'm a junior.
Speaker 1: Oh, you're a jun--junior?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: Remember, I got credits now. I wasn't stupid.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  (Laughter) You got a lot of credits, huh?
Speaker 2: I got plenty of credits.  When I get to Drake, I'm a junior.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you're there, and what are you thinking you want to major in?
Speaker 2: I'm majoring in philosophy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what makes you think that you're interested in philosophy?
Speaker 2: Because I'm an intellectual.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Laughter) And so, Reverend Pressley, where along the way did you become an intellectual?
Speaker 2: I've alw--I've always been an intellectual.
Speaker 1: (Laughter.) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So anyway, so you--but no, seriously.
Speaker 2: No, I'm dead serious.
Speaker 1: No, but what made you decide to, to declare your major as philosophy?
Speaker 2: I, I had a major in philosophy, okay?  And a minor in social science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, so at Drake, are you--
Speaker 2: I was the only African American philosophy major at Drake.
Speaker 1: How many--how large was the African American population?
Speaker 2: Twenty-four.
Speaker 1: Out of how many?
Speaker 2: Three thousand.
Speaker 1: And so did, did--was the group of twenty-four, was it cohesive?
Speaker 2: Marginally so.  Most of the, the African Americans were male.  There were twenty-two males.  What'd I say, twenty-four?  There were twenty-eight.  Twenty-six males and two females.  And the--80 percent of us were athletes.
Speaker 1: This was not--was there a lot of interracial dating?  This is not--
Speaker 2: What are you talking about?  They'd throw you out of school for interracial dating.
Speaker 1: School for that.  Okay.  Well, this is still--
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)--the '50 [1950s], right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My roommate, Luther White, was put on--he was a senior.  I went back to pick him up to take him to school for our senior year, and he said, "Mate, they kicked me out on social probation."  He had dated a white girl the year before.  So he had to transfer to West--not had to transfer to West Virginia, but did transfer to West Virginia State [University, Institute, West Virginia] where his brother was on the faculty, to graduate from college.
Speaker 1: Now, did you find Drake, that experience, how did it change you?
Speaker 2: Oh, Drake was a wonderful school.  I mean, you, you didn't date white girls, but Drake was a wonderful place to go to school.  And it, it blossomed me academically.
Speaker 1: And, and why was that?  Was it a nurturing environment?
Speaker 2: Very nurturing.  Very nurturing.  Very nurturing.  I had a, a door mother--as a matter of fact, they had just permitted African Americans to live in the dorm two years before I got there, okay?  But this old woman from Texas, Mother Ketchum [ph.], she loved me.  white woman.  She loved me.  And she said, "Now, Calvin, I'm going to see that you get through this school, and I'm going to give you a job because you're going to be dependable."  And I worked on the switchboard for two years and paid my room and board because of Mother Ketchum.  That was a, that was a privileged job.
Speaker 1: So, so at--and, and philosophy, now, are you--had you taken philosophy classes beforehand?
Speaker 2: Logic.
Speaker 1: Logic?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Which is a part of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: Which is the beginning part.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  So, are--were there--what kind of philosophers were you reading?  And, you know, who was your favorite?  And were you taking--
Speaker 2: Kant and Nietzsche and--
Story_ID: 192863
Speaker 1: Now, so you're taking--you're studying the classical philosophers--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so--and that is doing what?  Are you--
Speaker 2: It's opening up my mind into thinking about the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are the questions that are sort of going around in your mind about--
Speaker 2: Who am I?  Why am I here, okay.  What contribution am I gonna make to myself and to my family, okay?  Why is--now, now remember, you got--there, the sputnik is going up in the sky in 1955.  You know, [Former Prime Minister and President of Cuba, Fidel] Castro has come into power.  All these kinds of things are happening.
Speaker 1: Civil Rights Movement is--
Speaker 2: It's just starting.
Speaker 1: Just starting.
Speaker 2: As a--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--formalized movement--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --aggressive formalized movement.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  And you--you're--but you started to question life and its meaning?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your place in it?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you take any Philosophy of Religion courses?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's part of the core curriculum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Of the ph--okay.
Speaker 2: Of the Philosophy Department.
Speaker 1: For--oh, I--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Philosophy of--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Religion is a part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Did you have a favorite, you know, philosophers related to--you know, religious philosopher did you have?
Speaker 2: A favorite religious philosopher?  Now, you have to separate that question because remember, I'm formally trained in theology, but at the graduate level, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I would have to say that [Dietrich Von] Hildebrand would've been my favorite.  He was a Lutheran [sic, Catholic] philosopher theologian.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'll come back.  But--well, with Hildebrand, what, what concepts did you most grab onto his--in terms of his approach?
Speaker 2: The simplicity of his approach to meaning and purpose.  If you--there's no reason for you to know it, but the basic Lutheran Catechism, what's the purpose of man?  To love God and enjoy him forever.  That's pretty simple.  But the complexities are enormous, so it's, it's that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's simplicit--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And his, and his practical approach to critical theological exploration.
Speaker 1: And, and so has that guided you through your life?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In a lot of ways.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 192864
Speaker 1: Now, so you spent two years at Drake [University, Des Moines, Iowa]--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --and you graduate, and then this is 19--
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Fifty-nine [1959].  Okay.  And what are you thinking, at that point, that you want to do or be?  You said--
Speaker 2: Good question.  Now, remember, 1959, I'm graduating from college.  I've made a promise to get married, okay?
Speaker 1: So you've met Iona [Pressley]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we had been dating now for two years, okay?  She's been back the--
Speaker 1: Your parents [George Washington Pressley and Pansy Cooper Pressley]--
Speaker 2: --summer before--
Speaker 1: --have met her?
Speaker 2: They know her, and then all the rest of them.  But, you know, you're still not sure, okay?  I was thinking about going to law school, okay?  But my church, they raised their heads again, and I go to work for the summer of 1959, okay, for the [United Methodist] Board of Global Ministries in an internship in Charleston, South Carolina, okay, at the Wesley [United Methodist] Church, okay?  Iona comes to Charleston because now she has to meet the rest of the family, the patriarchs.  She hasn't met my grandfather; she hadn't met my uncle, who is the baby of my grandfather's family.  So she gets to meet all of these people.  We come to New York [New York], okay, after that sojourning through the south with her getting the blessings of everybody.  And Reverend [Dr. William M.] James, we go to church Sunday, and he asked me, "Well, what are you doing tomorrow?"  And I say, "Well, no, what, what--he said, "Well, meet me here.  Bring your car."  So I pick him up Monday morning.  I say, "Where we going, Reverend James?"  He said, "We're going to Madison, New Jersey."  So we drive out to Madison, New Jersey.  He goes in--we go in together, he said "Dean Anderson," he says, "Here's a new student for you," okay?  He says, "He'll be enrolling in September."  Now, this is, this is mid-August now, okay?  And that's how I got to seminary [Drew University, Madison, New Jersey].  I applied to seminary after I was admitted.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.  So he really saw something into--in you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and wanted--Reverend James wanted to guide your--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --your career.  And so are you--but you have great respect for him?
Speaker 2: Great respect.
Speaker 1: So it's not like you're going to balk?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because my respect for the man turned out for admiration for the profession.
Speaker 1: But did you know that at the time?  Were you feeling like, when you, you know, went, went up there, did you feel like, well, this is a little too soon, too quickly?  Any trepidation at all?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have the money for law school, and they paid all the money, so I--you have to say that's a practical response, but that wasn't their motivation.
Story_ID: 192865
Speaker 1: So now you get--so you, you and Iona [Pressley] move, moved to--are you--do you move to New Jersey?  You move--
Speaker 2: No.  No, we're not married yet.
Speaker 1: Oh, you're not married.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: We're supposed to get married June of 1960.  Iona says, "Well, unless you give me a ring, we're not engaged."  Now, I don't have any money, but I convinced my mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley] we could go to Bush Jewelry [ph.] and buy her a ring.  So we buy her a ring.  And so she goes back to Iowa.  But in the first semester of seminary [Drew University, Madison, New Jersey], I'll tell you another aside to the story.  They used to tease me in college.  Iona can type about one hundred words a minute, okay?  And where she worked at the [Des Moines] Educational Association, they had the fancy new IBMs [International Business Machines], not the [IBM] Selectrics [typewriter], but the proportion stuff, and so my papers looked like they were printed.  So I'm sure I got some of the grades on the basis of that, okay?  My seminary colleague, now Bishop [F. Herbert] Skeete, retired, and I started--he was older.  He had a wife and, and, and two children.  We started seminary together, okay?  This is first semester.  And we both were living on the campus at Drew.  Every Wednesday, we'd--we wouldn't get there until Monday, but every Wednesday, Herb Skeete would look me and say, "Man, ride back into the city with me.  I have to see my wife."  And I said, "Herb, I don't have none--no time to do that.  I better do this work.  Oh, man, come on, go with me."  So then he starts on me.  He says, "Man, when you gonna get married?"  He says, "You know, if you got married, we could commute daily together, and we wouldn't have to stay on this campus."  I said, "Man, what are you talking about?  I'm, I'm not sure I'm gonna be ready to get married in June, not to mention any time before then."  So he starts and I commute with him to see his--not to see his wife, 'cause my parents live in New York [New York].  I go home.  So we get around the, the first marking period, when the first papers are due, okay?  And I can type, 'cause I learned to type, but I can't type like Iona can type, and, you know, it takes a long time.  So he says, "You see," he says, "If you got married, we'd be straight."  We got married December 19th, 1959 (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  Oh, that's cute.
Story_ID: 192866
Speaker 1: See, Drew [University, Madison, New Jersey], has an undergraduate school, it's called Brothers College [Drew University, Madison, New Jersey], but the whole thing's called Drew University [Madison, New Jersey].  But the theological school is a graduate part of the, the school.
Speaker 2: So now, you are there, and you get--I mean, your--you get married, but I'm wondering also about your--you know, the education that you're receiving in seminary.  And it's a two--it's a--
Speaker 1: The best.  Three years.
Speaker 2: Three-year program.
Speaker 1: Ninety credit masters.  And it's the most broadening experience I've ever had.
Speaker 2: And what--
Speaker 1: And it's the culmination--shouldn't have been the culmination because you can continue to study, but the--it, it was broadening, and, and offered new dimensions around the thinking about God, and the universe, and, and the self, and how we relate to it, and how we relate to people.  I was very good in the clinical aspects of it.  The clinical training at one of the, the toughest mental health hospitals in the country, if not, the, the, the State of, of New Jersey, Greystone [Park Psychiatric Hospital, Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey].  And had interns in local parishes learning the practice of ministry.  It was a wonderful experience.
Story_ID: 192867
Speaker 1: Now, you--can you just describe what seminary education [at Drew University, Madison, New Jersey] is like?  You know, what types of courses, and then, you know, when does the clinical come and play a role?  Is that the last year?  And, you know, and, you know, and what, what is being sort of messaged to you in, in that way?
Speaker 2: Okay.  First you--they make certain assumptions.  First of all, they assume that you know this--that this is a professional school, okay?  That's the first thing, meaning that they're training religious professionals, okay?  Secondly, that they don't pro--religious professionals who don't think critically.  And thirdly, they don't need religious professionals who don't have institutional affiliations, United Methodist Church, okay, not if the church is going to pay for this training.  That's the--those, those are the first things, okay?  Now, part of what I didn't tell you is going to church with my mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley], you do a lot of memory work, so I memorized a lot of the Bible, okay?  I don't remember anything now, but I--when I was coming along, and that put me in good stead in churches that--in Sunday school classes.  People would reference me for questions and stuff like that, okay?  That kind of fundamental training.  Seminary, I give you that background because seminary, theological school, is not that, at least the good ones, okay?  What would you take?  You would begin with understanding the Old Testament, which would be--I don't remember what the numbers are, but let's say Old Testament 101.  And you'd have to take 15 credits.  You'd get three credits for that, but you'd have to take 15 credits, okay, in the Old Testament, okay?  You would move from 101 to 102, which would still be understanding the general concepts of the Old Testament, okay?  But then the next set of series might be three credits in the Psalms, three credits in the Prophets, three credits, etc., in the minor Prophets or the major Prophets, or in the Wisdom Literature, meaning Job and Ecclesiastes, and stuff like that, okay?  Then you have to take New Testament, 15 credits of that, okay?  101 and 102 would be general studies regarding the New Testament.  Then, the course breakouts would be three credits in the Gospel, in the parallel Gospels, because there are three that are parallel, and one, John, that is not parallel Gospel; it's written different than the rest of them, okay?  You might take a course in the Acts.  I know you take a course in the Acts of the Apostles, okay?  Then you might get in the--to the Letters; most of them are three credit classes, okay?  So that's the Bible, okay?  Then you have to take a sequence, the History of the Christian Church, okay?  From the year zero, okay, up 'till now, up to when you're in seminary, okay?  That would be a survey course, but then you would have to take the early Christian fathers, the Bishop of Hippo, and, and places like this, the early church development divided out, okay?  Then you would take Philosophy of Religion, okay?  Then you take Christian art.  You would take the practical courses, preaching, okay?  You start with speech, but you go to, I guess, it's about nine hours in, in preaching, okay?  And then there are the Pastoral courses, the Psychology courses, and the clinical training, if you elected; everybody didn't do the clinical training.
Story_ID: 192868
Speaker 1: Describe the clinical training [at Drew University, Madison, New Jersey] and what the purpose is.  So it was optional clinical?
Speaker 2: No, it's not optional, you have to take the basic courses.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But to do further work in it, it's optional.  Describe what it is.  Well, basically, it's the same kind of training that a psychologist, not a psychiatrist, but a psychologist would get, in terms of, of, of getting an understanding of the individual, what motivates the individual, and what you can do to, to help clear up some of the psychosis that all of us have, okay?  They try to do it in a laboratory experience where you're dealing with severe cases of, of schizophrenia, because they help you deal with milder ones, okay?  And all this is so that you can be a better pastoral counselor.  You work on your listening skills.
Speaker 1: So now, you said you were particularly good at clinical.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So did you do clinical your last year or was the clinical throughout?  That's what--
Speaker 2: Clinical throughout.
Speaker 1: Oh, clinicals throughout?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you get--so what is the affiliation that the school, that Drew [University, Madison, New Jersey] has, that--and were you being, you know, placed to do your clinical?
Speaker 2: Greystone [Park Psychiatric] Hospital [Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Oh, Grey--
Speaker 2: It's in the mental hospital.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were--okay.  I, I heard Greystone.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So was--you were in the mental hospital?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All the seminary students?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, but that was your placement?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Now, I got it.  Okay.  So you were--okay.  So--but you're doing--you--Grey--okay.  So you're seeing patients?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And writing process narratives on each of the, on each of the meetings.
Speaker 1: I see.  And--
Speaker 2: As a training tool.
Speaker 1: I understand.  So what, so what kind of patients were you seeing then?
Speaker 2: All kinds.
Speaker 1: All kinds.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--but you're acting in tandem with the therapists?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was supervised.  It--
Speaker 1: No, I understand it's supervised--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but, so you're the spiritual part of the, of the, of the medical team, is that what--
Speaker 2: No, I'm the student part on the medical team.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they don't--
Speaker 1: Right.  So were there things that you learned--okay, I--okay.  I heard you say Greystone, I guess I didn't understand--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that it was--okay.  Okay.  So are there things that you're learning from that?  Did you--were you doing that the whole time or was that just one clinical place?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  No.  No.  I, I was at Greystone a whole year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --okay?  But there are prep courses before you can get to Greystone--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --okay?
Speaker 1: And so what are you learning in that experience?
Speaker 2: You're learning about yourself and about people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are you learn--
Speaker 2: The only thing that's missing is 100 hours of psychoanalysis.
Speaker 1: That's what you're learning?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 192869
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are you learn--what are you learning about yourself, though?  'Cause at this point, you're newly married, you're in--you are in your mid-twenties, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Mid-twenties, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm still young; because remember, I finished high school at sixteen.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let me see, I went to Drew [University, Madison, New Jersey] at twenty-two, yeah, and graduated twenty-five.  Okay.  I'm learning to convince my wife [Iona Pressley] that I'm not crazy, which she's thinking that I am.
Speaker 1: Wait.  She's thinking you are because you're in--not because you're in seminary?
Speaker 2: No, but because--
Speaker 1: Because--
Speaker 2: --of the way I'm talking about--
Speaker 1: Things.
Speaker 2: --the experience, the things that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --life is--she don't want to hear about that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She wants to go and keep moving forward.
Speaker 1: So before--but that's what I'm wondering, what are you learning about yourself?  Because this--I mean, what--
Speaker 2: I'm learning that I have potential yet undeveloped, and I better get about the business of developing it.  And I'm also learning that I don't have to act out, that people are more afraid of me than I am of them.  But we are not related to each other on the basis of fear, but of love, so we need to eliminate coercion from our interactions with each other.
Speaker 1: And in the institution [Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital, Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey] what are you seeing?  Are you seeing fear?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, that's (unclear).  Fear and guilt complexes; the guilt is easier to deal with than the guilt complexes.
Speaker 1: You mean, the patients had guilt--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --complexes?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How they had let people down?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  How they let themselves down, primarily.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 192870
Speaker 1: And so are you thinking at this point now--that was one placement.  Did you have any placements with the church?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--okay.
Speaker 2: The Presbyterian Church in Patterson [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Patterson.  Now, who was the minister there?
Speaker 2: You know, I've forgotten his name?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 2: And then after that first year, the second year I was placed in my home church, Metropolitan Community [United Methodist] Church [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: That's right.  Okay.  So you--but you end up going to Metropolitan [Community United Methodist Church, New York, New York], right?  No.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Okay.  So you're back home, in a way?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who was the minister at this--what--
Speaker 2: Reverend--Reverend [Dr. William M.] James is still there.
Speaker 1: He's still there?
Speaker 2: He was there for forty-four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he--so you're his mentee return home?
Speaker 2: That's home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I bring everybody I can find to him, including [HistoryMaker] Carl McCall.
Story_ID: 192871
Speaker 1: So now, what are you--do you start out as a associate pastor?
Speaker 2: Now, that's another story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I graduate from theological school, seminary at Drew [University, Madison, New Jersey]; part of what happens in our church is when you graduate, you get your final ordination, and you get assigned to a church.  Now, I told you that our church, structurally, is not in the black part of our denomination. We are in the white part of the denomination, and we haven't integrated yet, okay?  The structure spent the whole--my whole last year in seminary trying to work out a placement in a cross-racial appointment.
Speaker 1: Because of the times?
Speaker 2: Because of the times, okay?  They don't get it done, so I get appointed as Reverend [Dr. William M.] James' third associate at Metropolitan [Community United Methodist] Church [New York, New York]; he's already got two.  I get appointed as the third one.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: I promised God and five white men they won't appoint me anymore, I'll make my own appointments.
Speaker 1: So, but he's glad to have you back?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so how large is the congregation?
Speaker 2: About 2,500.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Which is a good size church back then?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good size--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --church there.  And this Metropolitan had always been active in the community?
Speaker 2: Very.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And is this--is--are its programs increasing by the time you get back--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in terms of outreach to the community?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I add a dimension to it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'm from the community, the community knows me, young people know me--
Story_ID: 192872
Speaker 1: I have one question.  Your mother [Pansy Cooper Pressley], what--and your--your father [George Washington Pressley], what are they saying, at this point?  Or do you remember them--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  My father always wanted to be a preacher, but he never wanted to be a jack-leg preacher, and his father couldn't, at that point, afford to send him to school.  So he was very supportive, and my mother too.  I come from a very religious family.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that was the church?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I became their, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --their proud son.
Speaker 1: So here--and is your mother back at Metropolitan [Community United Methodist Church, New York, New York] at this--
Speaker 2: Not yet.
Speaker 1: Oh, she's not back?
Speaker 2: It takes her a few more years.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.  So where is she at this point?
Speaker 2: She's still at King's Chapel [Presbyterian Church, Brooklyn, New York, New York] 'till they get this crazy preacher.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see, and it drives--
Speaker 2: Who wants, who wants a cult following.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she knows more about the Bible than he does.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's who drives her out--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and she comes--okay.  Your father, has he been going to Metropolitan or he's not--
Speaker 2: No, he's still at Salem [United Methodist Church, Harlem, New York, New York].
Story_ID: 192873
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, so you come, and what--and there are two others besides you, so is there--are they--were they similarly from Metropolitan [Community United Methodist Church, Harlem, New York, New York] or one of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --his [Reverend Dr. William M. James] proteges?
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, they were from out of the country--not--not out of the country, out of the city [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--but they have been assigned there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--but is three too many to have?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So where do you--are you intimidating to the others 'cause you've got a special and you know the community and can make--I'm just--
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: No.  No, not at all.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  They, they, they knew me.  They were--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --accepting of me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I was only there six months.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I made my own appointment.
Speaker 1: You made your appointment, Reverend Pressley?  I mean--okay.  You made your own appointment there?
Speaker 2: I, I, I became, I became the pastor of the Church of Open Door--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is an interdenominational church with Methodist support in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: So how does that happen?  Okay, first of all, people don't make their own appointments.
Speaker 2: No, I was teasing--(laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But the jobs that you see listed there, the United Methodist City Society, and the New York City Mission Society, I became the chief executive at both of them, but both of them had financial support for the Church of the Open Door when I became its pastor in 1963.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how is this--but--okay.  Tell me, don't make me pull it out--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --of you, tell--
Speaker 2: I'll, I'll be glad to tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me what actually, you know, happened.
Speaker 2: All right.  [Dr.] Henry [C.] Wyman, who as the executive director of the United Methodist City Society [New York, New York], and [David] Dave Barry, who was the executive director of the New York City Mission Society [New York, New York], had an opening at the Church of the Open Door.  The Church of the Open Door is an interdenominational church that was started by the Presbyterians, okay?  And the seven historic denominations, Protestant denominations, had built the church and had provided it with its pastor, okay?  They had never had a Methodist pastor, okay?  Congregational pastors, Presbyterian pastors, but never a Methodist, but the church wasn't that old.  It was just built in 1954.  I became its first Methodist pastor.
Story_ID: 192874
Speaker 1: So you, you get--
Speaker 2: To be the pastor.  I'm the twenty five-year-old pastor of the Church of the Open Door, which is at 201 Gold Street in Brooklyn [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And the church has been around how long?
Speaker 2: Since 1954.
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954], so it has--how large is the congregation?
Speaker 2: The congregation's about five hundred.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's a difference.  Okay.  But it's a nice size.
Speaker 2: It's a nice size congregation.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Boy, okay.  And so what do you--and your--okay.  The congregation, is it a mixed congregation or it's mainly still African American?
Speaker 2: African American, but we had a Spanish speaking congregation.  We had three staff people.  We had a Spanish speaking minister, and a director of religious education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Reverend Pressley, can I just--what would a twenty five-year-old person know about running a church, though?  I mean, you haven't even trained.
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  I'm just saying.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: I mean, usually you work your way up through the ranks.
Speaker 2: We'll--we'll get back to this.  But I came out to be their pastor.  They were very loving and kind to me.  I guess in 1990, they asked me to come back and help them find a pastor, and I went there and I volunteered a year for them for free.  I told them I owed you from 1963, when you paid me for nothing.
Speaker 1: So you're full of enthusiasm--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I would take it.
Speaker 2: And, and arrogance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mainly arrogance.
Speaker 1: Well, that seems to be a trait.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're--you're setting about, what are you wanting to do with your new church?
Speaker 2: Well, I want to make it a big church.  Every preacher wants to make their church a big church, but I have no intentions of staying there, okay?  Because remember, in our denomination, okay, you want to be a Bishop, okay?  So I had planned to stay there five years, okay, go to big church for ten years and get elected Bishop.  Now, I knew that I had to work hard to get that done, and there would be spiritual and religious benefits to the people to get that done.  But I knew where I wanted to go, career-wise.  None of that ever happened.
Speaker 1: So what do you, what do you set about to do though there?  Programmatically-wise, and have the--who--how many have been before you, I guess, at the Church of the--
Speaker 2: Four.
Speaker 1: Oh, so there have been four.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They, they very short periods of time.
Speaker 1: They are short?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they were interested in their careers, okay?  All right.  But I knew that if I was going to be an effective person, the training that I received from [Reverend Dr. William] Bill James and Metropolitan [Community United Methodist Church, Harlem, New York, New York] would help me focus, okay?  And so what we did, we had one of the best youth programs of any church in the city.  Received help from the [New York City] Mission Society [New York, New York] to achieve it, but it was a good program.  We were in the midst of, at the time, the largest housing development programs, the Fort Greene Farragut houses [Brooklyn, New York, New York].  The church sits right in the middle, and we were the community's pastor.  They knew when they needed spiritual and religious help that we would provide it, okay?  We also tried to get our young people to think beyond themselves.  We preceded the Peace Corps with our--we took a group of teenagers to the Dominican Republic in 1964 to build a church in the summer, okay?  So we were very aggressive in that, in that regard.  We had good worship, good music, and I was a community activist, as a matter of fact.  I mean, we were very much involved in the, the, the school boycotts, etc.
Story_ID: 192875
Speaker 1: So your--are you under Reverend [Dr. William M.] James'--who's--
Speaker 2: At the Church of the Open Door [Brooklyn, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: No, I know, but are you--who's tutelage are you under, at this point?
Speaker 2: I'm by myself now.
Speaker 1: You're by--I understand that, I was just thinking you were consulting with someone every once in awhile.  No.
Speaker 2: Always consult with Reverend James.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: I consult with him now.
Speaker 1: And he's still alive?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Tell me what--so you're doing these programs and you have the benefit of youth; I mean, you've got the energy--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I'm saying of youth.  Okay.  So you're out making things happen.  It's the tower of the times.  How long do you, you stay there how long?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Three years?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I didn't get to five.
Speaker 1: Now, why?
Speaker 2: Because here's where we get to this first of history makers.  First of all, we have now required a new generation of leadership, what I call unflappable technocrats to help manage our community through this economic anti-poverty growth that we're about to experience, okay?  And what happened for me is I got more opportunities than I deserved, too quickly, and I had to learn to do them by the seat of my pants.
Speaker 1: You mean all the things you were doing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --because that's a lot, that's why I said you have the energy of youth.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.  But we learned to do them by the seat of our pants.  You know, there was, there was no book that you could go to and say this is how you do this, this is how you do that, this is how you do this, okay?  And if you were prepared to take some risk and to work hard, and to be honest with yourself, the people you were working with in your community, you could maybe not be unflappable, but you could be a decent technocrat and move the community along, okay?  And that's what we tried to do.  I left the Church of the Open Door because the [New York City] Mission Society [New York, New York] needed a person on its staff to coordinate its activities on the war on poverty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is that where OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] came in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it's--
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: --it's beyond that.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-three [1963], but I--we were at 1963, I thought--
Speaker 2: I was there--I was at the [Church of the] Open Door [Brooklyn, New York, New York] from '63 [1963] to '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: 1967, but it says here OIC in 1966; was that maybe--
Speaker 2: That's, that's wrong.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's, that's wrong.  I was at the Church of the Open Door three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was at the, the, the--on the staff of the society for one year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then OIC.
Speaker 1: '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: --for, for eleven years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--oh, okay, then that--okay.  Great.
Story_ID: 192876
Speaker 1: So you went with the Mission Society to do--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay. So they're, they're very involved.  Can you talk about the [New York City] Mission Society [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --a little bit so people may not, you know--
Speaker 2: The New York City Mission Society is the oldest charity in the City of New York [New York].  It was started in 1812 as the lay response, layperson's, response to the poverty that existed in the, in the cities, okay?  Have you seen the picture, 'Gangs of New York'?  Okay.  The Five Points Missionary [sic, Mission] was the [New York City] Mission Society's Church operation, okay?  But that's not all it did.  It started the Visiting Nurses [Service of New York] program before it became a, a, a formal type program, just started the Community Service Society [Of New York].  It was a pioneer in the delivery of human social services in the City of New York [New York], and a model for human service delivery around the country.  It limited itself because it would never give up its religious roots.  See, most services now, they--not, not now, but then started to be provided a non-sectarian basis, and the Mission Society insisted on its sectarian participation in its human service delivery.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But was it connected with the Methodist Church?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  So it was, it was--
Speaker 2: It, it's inter-denominational.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Really started by the Presbyterians--
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --but inter-denominational.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  That's right.  They--
Speaker 2: United Methodist City Society--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --the last one--(Simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is, is connected to them.
Speaker 1: I see.  So--
Speaker 2: We ran camps, sleepaway camps, scholarship programs, after school programs, community centers in the City of New York.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 192877
Speaker 1: Well, can we put this, also the war of--on poverty, in hist--historical context?  A lot of money is coming into the--
Speaker 2: A lot of money, okay?  I can remember when we were invited to the City of New York [New York], (unclear) to start a summer youth program with funds from the Neighborhood Youth Corps [New York, New York], okay?  And we wanted to know how much money they gonna give us to do it.  They said $4,000,000.  We almost died.  Almost went through the floor.  I never heard of $4,000,000 before, okay?  Now, ultimately, we didn't get it because the politics of New York are such that they had to divide it up, but they wanted to initially give it all to the [New York City] Mission Society [New York, New York] to run the summer Neighborhood Youth Corps program.
Speaker 1: That's a huge amount of money back then.
Speaker 2: In 1965, yes.  Huge amount of money, okay?  Okay.  That's why I said that this provided us an opportunity to now work toward becoming good managers of social service programs.
Speaker 1: So Rev--
Speaker 2: And I became a very good one.
Speaker 1: You did.  Okay.  You did, because a lot of people didn't.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean, a lot of money got wasted.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, so was that--
Speaker 2: That's what I'm most proud of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that--so you became a good--you started to become a good manager within that year of working with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when you started, but you don't become a good manager in a year.
Speaker 1: No.  No, I know.  So what, because it created structure, sort of, there was struct--
Speaker 2: Creative resources that we never dreamed that we would have.  And that provided an opportunity to really do something that you would never do with the, with the collections that, that the people would bring for the support of religious work, or that would be raised in the private sector from foundations, etc.  That was an enormous amount of money.
Story_ID: 192878
Speaker 1: So what are you doing for the Methodist [sic, New York City Mission] Society for that year?
Speaker 2: I'm not doing anything for the Methodist, for the--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: For the--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --City Society.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The [New York City] Mission Society [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: The Mission Society, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm running the Summer Youth Corps program, okay.  With thousands of kids being employed, they were being made $39 a week, and we had to create the jobs for them, okay?  We pay them and all the rest of that, that stuff.  We're the largest now subcontractor for Vista volunteers, okay?  We're contracting with the Federal Government to supervise volunteers and services for America.  We're running coffee shops in--this is after the riots now, coffee shops, okay, and afterschool programs, etc., and I'm coordinating all of this.
Speaker 1: And you're still young.
Speaker 2: Oh, twenty-eight.
Speaker 1: Twenty-eight?  Okay.  So you do that, then how, how does OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers] come in too?
Speaker 2: Well, we determined that we were doing all these things for young people, okay?  And their parents were out of work, okay?  And so we hear about this program in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and [HistoryMaker] Carl [McCall] and I get on the train, and it's fortuitous he's here today; but anyway, we get on the train, we go to Philadelphia and get a tour.  He is now Chairman of the New York City's Anti-Poverty Program.
Speaker 1: Carl?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So we go to Philadelphia, we meet with [Reverend Dr. Leon] Sullivan.  We see the old jailhouse and stuff like that.  And so Carl asked him, "Well, can we duplicate your program in New York?"  He says, "Yes, if you get this young man to run it," pointing at me, okay?  And get Milton Galamison to be the Chairman of the Board.  Milton Galamison was a Presbyterian minister in Brooklyn who we worked with in the school boycotts in New York City, trying to change the school system, and we knew that we could do both those things, and we agreed, and then we started OIC.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about Reverend [Dr.] Leon Sullivan, and what, you know, even how he came to, you know, start OIC and even what type of person he was?
Speaker 2: Visionary, okay?  Risk taker; inspirer; very practical; not much of a planner, okay?  Not a great manager, but he knew his system needed to be managed, okay?  The New York City OIC was the largest OIC in the country.  We had training centers in four of the five burrows, and we trained a couple of thousand people a year.  And I never go anyplace in New York and I don't see people come up to me, "Oh, you're Reverend Pressley.  I remember you.  I used to go to OIC in Brooklyn [New York, New York].  I went to work for Banker's Trust, and now I'm doing so and so.  And you know, I'm even retired now."  Okay.  So that is the impact that OIC had.  Dr. Sullivan was an entrepreneur.  He was good at economic development, and he knew that the jobless problem was not--that the jobless was not the, the problem, they were the opportunity, okay?  And he challenged the powers that be, Republicans and Democrats, okay, to respond to his efforts.  And he'd tell you in a minute, OIC's going to save America.  I'm convinced that the concept is a good concept, okay?  The structural employment program's in this country needs systemic change, okay?  OIC was an individual approach toward the structural change problems.  It worked, but we need something else in this society to change it.
Speaker 1: You mean now?
Speaker 2: Now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 192879
Speaker 1: Now, but can we go back to then, and you know, African Americans have been cut out of the whole sort of economic structure--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for the most part.  So here--how--
Speaker 2: Out of the progressive economic structure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How is [Reverend] Dr. [Leon] Sullivan--where, where does OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers] come out of?  What is its history?  You know, and how long had it been around at the time that you became associated with it?
Speaker 2: About three years, four at the most, okay?
Speaker 1: So it, so it started--
Speaker 2: It started in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], okay?
Speaker 1: And what was--
Speaker 2: And what happened--
Speaker 1: What--tell--
Speaker 2: --is that, that African Americans were losing their jobs in Philadelphia, and Dr. Sullivan said--and the preachers in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia movement, said that, "Look, we are consumers and we spend a lot of money with your products.  If you are not going to give our people jobs, we're going to boycott you."  And so they started the boycotts in Philadelphia, and they started boycotting people like TastyKake and a lot of the consumer products.  And then the people who manufactured them said, "Look, what can we do to be helpful?"  And he says, "You can help me train my people.  I don't want a handout, I want a hand-up."  It was a favorite saying of his.
Speaker 1: And--now, did the Philadelphia movement that you refer to, and his--the work there, was that out of the black church or was that out of the inter-denominational that, that arose?  Was it different?  That's what--
Speaker 2: Inter-denominational, but primarily, the black church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: It was a church movement.
Story_ID: 192880
Speaker 1: Had, had--so [HistoryMaker] Carl [McCall] initiated, but--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but you brought--where was Carl before this?
Speaker 2: You need to interview him, but--
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: --let me tell you where he is.  He comes from the Blue Hill Project in Boston [Massachusetts], okay, which is a community project church.  He comes to work for the New York City Mission Society [New York, New York] in a project that is created called Church Community Services in Brooklyn [New York, New York], okay?  One of the first things we get involved with in Church Community Services is the protest at the building of the downstate medical center because they have no black journeyman working in the unions at downstate, and this is the largest medical center development on the East Coast, if not the country.  We challenged the governor, we challenged the mayor, okay?  We go to jail protesting and they start to open up by responding, okay, to our protest, okay?  Carl then leaves Church Community Service because some of the private foundations now want to help, and he becomes a staff officer of the [Berkshire Community] Taconic Foundation, okay?  But it comes out of the work of the New York City Mission Society and the leadership it provides for this community mobilization in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: So when the two of you went to meet with [Reverend] Dr. [Leon] Sullivan, he was with the Taconic Foundation?
Speaker 2: Yes, and, and the Chairman of the Council.
Speaker 1: Of, of--
Speaker 2: --which as a volunteer there--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --but he was working for Taconic.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.  So you then--this is sort of an opportunity to make something happen--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --okay, for adults?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, you take Dr. Sullivan's format?
Speaker 2: Format and his model.
Speaker 1: His model.
Speaker 2: And implemented in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But now, do you get any funding from him?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We get funding from the pov--from the poverty council.
Speaker 1: From--in New York?
Speaker 2: Yeah, which he chairs.
Speaker 1: Oh, I--okay.  So Dr. Sullivan's not providing any--
Speaker 2: No, not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to New York.
Speaker 1: Not to New York.  So he's basically franchising the concept--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  To--but with the same name and structure?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But how are the things linked?  There--are they all--'cause I all see exists--
Speaker 2: There is, there is no contractual relationship between OIC New York and OIC Philadelphia.  There's an affiliates agreement, but it's not contractual.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But your--you--he--okay.  So is he setting up--how many of these are being set up besides--
Speaker 2: Anyplace he can set them up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Anyplace he can convince people.
Speaker 2: Anyplace he can convince people to do it, but you need several things.  You need community support, okay?  The leadership, and you need money, both from the public and the private sector, and we were able to produce all of those things in New York in large numbers.
Speaker 1: And in what period of time then did you become the largest then?
Speaker 2: In about five years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 192881
Speaker 1: Can you tell me the process that you, you know, you, you took, you took--did you take the same co--well, you were in Brooklyn [New York, New York].  Did you take--tell me what you did.  Tell me who your--who you were--
Speaker 2: First of all, we--
Speaker 1: --after, who your partners--
Speaker 2: --we organized a citywide board at the very beginning, okay, where we had representatives from churches, from community groups, etc., sitting on the Board of Directors citywide, okay?  Because we knew that we, while we might start in Brooklyn, it would have to go citywide if it was going to be effective.  We also knew that we had to cultivate the politicians citywide if we were going to have the resources to do what we needed to do.  But we started in Brooklyn, okay?  Now, the first deal, and we, we've been through a million deals, was at OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers], was supposed to get its money from the New York [City] Council Against Poverty, but through the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation [Brooklyn, New York, New York].  I don't know if you--
Speaker 1: Now, who was that--
Speaker 2: --know Frank Thomas?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, I know Frank Thomas.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  Frank was the head of the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration at the time, okay?  He, he and Milton Galamison didn't get along.  Milton was Chairman of the OIC board, but we've always had a good relation--he has a house up here.  I don't know whether you documented him or not, but he's--yeah, I saw him come up the other day.  So we got the money through the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, but for OIC Brooklyn, okay?  That was the first.  Then we moved from Brooklyn--now, we didn't move from Brooklyn 'cause the center continued to operation in Brooklyn for the lower east side, and we worked with the community leadership and developed our center on the lower east side.  Then we developed the Harlem Center, and IBM [International Business Machines] had a state of the art computer--we thought it was state of the art at the time--computer center they help us put together in Harlem [New York, New York].  Then we went to the Bronx [New York, New York], then we went to the Queens [New York, New York], following the same pattern.  Adults, challenging them through the FETA [Foundation for Emerging Technologies and Arts] program [sic, Foundation] because many of the adults didn't read too well, didn't write too well, didn't communicate too well, and that was the FETA program before we got into the technical skills training, which was also a part of the OIC design.  But the critical part of the OIC design was the placement and the follow-up.  We had to create jobs.  We had to develop them with, with corporations, and to place people in them, and make sure that the corporations created a climate where the people would stay.
Story_ID: 192882
Speaker 1: And what--I have a question:  Where is the [New York] Urban League [New York, New York] in all of this?
Speaker 2: The Urban League--
Speaker 1: Because that had been--I mean, they were a social service agency job placement, you know, so where are they fitting?  Are they partners or are they still doing--
Speaker 2: They are partners and competitors, okay?  They're not doing a lot of skills training, they're doing a lot of placement at a sort of higher level with persons who are closer to being ready for the job market.
Speaker 1: Like, like people who may be going into to be bank, bank tellers?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, we trained a whole bunch--
Speaker 1: Oh, you did?
Speaker 2: --of bank tellers.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, you know, they would've been placing secretaries and advanced clerks and stuff like that.  College graduates.
Speaker 1: And are there other competitors out there also that are sort of major besides OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but smaller.
Speaker 1: Smaller?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Recruitment and Training [Program, Inc.].  I don't know if you know [HistoryMaker] [Ernest] Ernie Green.  Ernie Green's outfit would've been a, a competitor, but a partner.
Speaker 1: And he was with--at that point, he was with--
Speaker 2: RTP [Recruitment and Training Program, Inc.] Recruitment--
Speaker 1: RTP.
Speaker 2: --and Training Program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, so you, so here you are--is--Re--Reverend [Leon] Sullivan is happy I take it?
Speaker 2: Oh, very happy.  Very happy.  Yeah, I'm one of his guys.  I'm one of his lieutenants.
Speaker 1: And you--
Speaker 2: And, and--
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: --the New York City program is a model now for the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you--do you outdistance Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] then?
Speaker 2: Yes, but they don't do it that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We outdist--them in many ways, but, you know, we acknowledge the mecca.
Story_ID: 192883
Speaker 1: You know, Reverend [Dr. Leon] Sullivan would take something good and use it, so he was never in competition with the New York [New York] program [Opportunities Industrialization Centers (OIC)], it was his program, and we kept it in the forefront.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Okay.  So what are the things that you're proud of that occurred, you know, in that eleven-year period?
Speaker 1: We trained a new generation of managers because they had to learn to manage this system.  We were able to transfer some of those abilities through the OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers] Executive Director's Association to the other OIC organizations across the country.  Now, Dr. Sullivan was very key in getting corporations to help do in-depth training for his managers, and I was the beneficiary of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] training, General Electric training.  So I keep telling you, I got advantages beyond what I would have ever hoped or dreamed, okay?  But those are some of the grateful things.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, when you think about, though, and it's--here you had, that model worked, in terms of having the corporations who knew how to do it best--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --actually doing the training.
Speaker 1: Doing the training.
Speaker 2: So they became a partner in that way?
Speaker 1: They became partners.
Speaker 2: Now, how are you--what are you learning about the training process?  What is good training?  What is bad training?  What are you learning about that?  And what are you learning about assessment, you know, of, you know, of training and the reporting process?  'Cause remember you said when you were at the Open Door Church [Brooklyn, New York, New York], you know, you were sort of--
Speaker 1: Learning by the seat of my--(Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Learning--(Simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--pants.
Speaker 2: --pants.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I learned by doing, but also through the firm, formal learning procedures, that there are more efficient ways of doing particular tasks, and we ought to try to be as efficient as we can be, if we're going to re--preserve our resources.  So we were very committed to doing things the most efficient way possible, and having our staff do it, okay?  We frowned on extravagance.  That was--would be--in terms of people who need to learn a skill, okay, to accomplish a particular task, can learn it with just basic rudimentary training.  But, what you want to do is put them in a position where they can build on that skill to develop to the next skill.
Story_ID: 192884
Speaker 1: So what about the social activism part?  I mean, what about the picketing, the, you know, the--are, are you involved any in that process?  Who are your partners or their, you know, people--the other people who are doing the picketing and you're then--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --you're doing the training once--
Speaker 2: Understand, the social protests starts to diminish when you got all that government money, okay?  That's, that's as fair as I can say it, and it's as honest as I can say it.  I'm now preoccupied with trying to make this work, and I'm supporting the pickets, the politicians.  One of the next things that he did was get elected to the Senate.  The OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers] people got him elected to the Senate in a local race, but it was citywide, you know, OIC participation that did it, okay?
Speaker 1: But, what--okay, before--and that's helpful information.  I'm trying to understand who are you dealing with?  Who are the people that you're collaborating with?  Who are the people that are--you're getting to know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and people, and people who are getting to know you?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm getting to know all the corporate types; the heads of corporations, because I'm [Reverend] Dr. [Leon] Sullivan's man in New York [New York], okay?  And he's transferring not the policy, but he's transferring the relationships, okay?  So we have access to them now, okay?  I'm getting to know because they need to know me because now, we got an army of people out there, the politicians, and they want to be helpful for their own reasons, and that's fine.  Getting to know and stay with the community leadership because we believe in the maximum participation of the people who are recipients of the service, okay?  And getting to know the people who deliver the services 'cause that's critical to the quality of the service provided.  So it's a comprehensive set of relationships necessary to maintain this organization.
Speaker 1: And are you--
Speaker 2: And now we're $7,000,000 a year worth of operation.
Speaker 1: Huge.  It's a huge project.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And no scandal; nothing that happens that, that is--
Speaker 2: No, no, no OIC scandal.
Speaker 1: No, OIC--
Speaker 2: I've not ever had a scandal on my watch.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good. (Laughter)  Well, there were a lot of, you know--okay, there's--
Speaker 2: Not on my watch.
Story_ID: 192885
Speaker 1: So now, you--but who, who in the corporate arena are you getting to know?  Who specifically?  And isn't this time--isn't--aren't we at the same time that [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jordan is now--is he--
Speaker 2: At the [National] Urban League [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: At the Urban League.  And he's come to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: No, he's been in New York with the--at the [United Negro] College Fund.  He just--
Speaker 1: At the coll--oh, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: He just transfers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He just--okay.  So he--okay.  So he's there on getting to know corporate Ameri--you know, so are you meeting each other?  This is--(laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, I know he'll be here in a few minutes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's how we got to know each other, by collaborating at the corporate level in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He's subject to walk in the door any minute, but anyway, that's not the point.  The point is that, yes, we're getting to, to know the same people, and they're getting to compare the relationships.  But remember, their relationships, their relationships are with the corporate CEOs [Chief Executive Officers], their relationships are with [Reverend] Dr. [Leon] Sullivan.  Vernon [Jordan] has this corporate relationships with himself, okay?  And we worked through the system with the assistance and the deputies, and that's fine with us 'cause all we want to do is get the job done.
Speaker 1: And you have taken your ministry in a new direction, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, a--
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: --whole lot further than I promised you it was gonna go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay. (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 192886
Speaker 1: Now, what are you learning about yourself, though, during this process?  I mean, you're at a heady time.  You're meeting a lot of people, there's a lot of excitement, you know, a lot of growth.
Speaker 2: I'm learning that it's a dangerous time for a minister to change his values.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So I volunteer to become the pastor of the Bushwick Avenue Method--United Methodist Church [sic, Bushwick United Methodist, Brooklyn, New York, New York] to get a, a new sense of grounding of pastoral ministry.
Speaker 1: And you felt that necessary?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, absolutely.  And I, I had to go back to the preparation of, of sermons every Sunday, and yeah.  I was still at OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers].  The last three years when I was at OIC, I was the minister of the chur--of the Bushwick Avenue United Methodist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a volunteer.
Speaker 1: As a vol--okay.  And was that church in--was it without a pastor and in need or is it--
Speaker 2: Well, Methodist Churches have pastors as they are assigned.  I, I convinced the denomination to appoint me there.
Speaker 1: Reverend Pressley, that seems to be, you know, either you're self-appointed or you convince them, so-- (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm just-- (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I knew I needed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The only time I heard you being recruited during this time is with Reverend [Dr. Leon] Sullivan.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and, and my, my family needed it.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why did they need it?
Speaker 2: Because I think that we were too loosey-goosey with our church relationships.  We would go to Metropolitan [Community United Methodist Church, Harlem, New York, New York] sometimes or someplace else sometime, but we needed some structure to our--
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: --devotion.
Speaker 1: I understand.  'Cause you're out--and that was a temptation--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, then, and-- (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, the temptation was even larger than that; it's to go corporate and there were opportunities--
Speaker 1: That's why I was asking.
Speaker 2: --and I rejected them.
Speaker 1: --was asking.  Okay.  And are you happy that you rejected them?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very much so.  I look at the pension and say no, but I'm--I'm getting plenty, so yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I under--
Speaker 2: --happy that I rejected.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're still, you know, grounding yourself in that you don't get caught up like a lot of the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --people who, you know, in the Civil Rights Movement has sort of got caught up in the money--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --part of things.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Or in the power--
Speaker 1: In the--
Speaker 2: --as such, because there were opportunities to go into the public sector too, that were not very attractive to me.  So, yes, I had to, to, to reclaim self and that grounding, for which I had felt that I had been called.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And at Bushwick [United Methodist, Brooklyn, New York, New York]--when you go back to Bushwick--I mean, when you go back--go to Bushwick, are-do you enjoy the process of being in the program?
Speaker 2: Every minute of it.  Every minute of it.  It was a kind of reawakening for me.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have all the min--you don't have--you're a volunteer pastor, you don't have all the ministerial duties like--
Speaker 2: I got all of them.
Speaker 1: You mean, funerals and--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I had all of them because I don't take jobs where I don't do all of them, or I don't take them at all.  I've got an associate, but he needs to learn a lot of things, which he--you should interview him.  He admits he learned while he was with me at Bushwick, okay?  But no, people are funny.  You can't tell them that you're a volunteer; they don't want to know that.  It's not their business anyway.  I'm your pastor.  If I'm your pastor, I need to provide your services.
Story_ID: 192887
Speaker 1: So what happens that you leave OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers]?  What--at what point--why are you--'cause you could've stayed there?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My predecessor at the New York City Mission Society [New York, New York] retired, and I didn't want to go but had to go.
Speaker 1: Now, your predecessor is who?
Speaker 2: Dave Barry.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Remember, he and Henry Wyman had the Church of the Open Door [Brookyln, New York, New York] assignment, and they delivered it for me.
Speaker 1: So he was calling you now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm on the board of the [New York City Mission] society [New York, New York].  He wasn't calling me, the board of the society was calling me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?  And what they were saying is that we feel that you've developed the leadership skills to come and, and run this old ancient institution and take it in a new direction, okay?  I was the first African American, first Methodist, to become the Executive Director of the city's oldest charity.
Speaker 1: So what are your thoughts then at this point?  Things have changed in this time period, you know, 'cause we're--you're in this--
Speaker 2: They're broke, okay?  And my thoughts is I got to--if I'm going to do this, I'm going to have to get them some money, okay?  But, as God would have it, the Lord always has a plan, okay?  A person who I had been sitting next to on the board of directors, okay, was an heiress to the Post [Cereals, Battle Creek, Michigan] fortune, Dina Merrill.  I didn't know who she was and didn't care; my wife [Iona Pressley] knew, but when Dave Barry retired, okay, she says, "Oh, Cal, I want you to become the Executive Director."  I said, "No, thank you, Dina."  She said, "Well, I'll tell you what, you help us find an Executive Director."  So I chaired the search committee, and we looked, and we looked, and we thought we'd find--found this guy, Scott, in [New] Jersey to come to run the society.  And I was in Washington in a meeting, and [former] Governor [Norman] Rockefeller called me and he says, "I understand you've given Dina a bad time."  I said, "What do you mean, Governor?"  I didn't know.  I knew him 'cause we had been protesting and--he said, "Dina wants you to become the Executive Director of the Mission Society, and you won't do it."  And I said, "Well, Governor, I got a job, and OIC is working very well, etc."  So he says, "Well, I want you to meet me at my office x, y, and z, and you bring Dina with you."  So I guess two or three days when I get back from Washington [District of Columbia], we go meet Governor Rockefeller.  And she said, "Oh, Cal, what do you, what do, what do we need to do to get this done?"  I said, "Well, Dina, you know that the Mission Society's broke.  We're invading our restricted capital.  We sit on the board together.  We got to raise some money.  Well, how much?  I said, "At a minimum, $5,000,000.  Well, I'm going to give a half a million, and Nelson's going to give a half a million, okay?  And we'll get the rest."  And then I was stuck.  So that's how I got the, the Mission Society.
Story_ID: 192888
Speaker 1: And so what were you plans then for the organization [New York City Mission Society, New York, New York]?  What did you do?  I'm saying times had changed.
Speaker 2: Times have changed.
Speaker 1: They have changed by now.
Speaker 2: My job now is to develop the resources and preserve the assets because they have tremendous assets.
Speaker 1: And what are the assets?
Speaker 2: The assets is its history, and its comm--and its, it's commitment to service; okay, that's the primary asset, but its got land value, got 1,800 acres up in Duchess County [New York], okay?
Speaker 1: For its camp.
Speaker 2: For its camp, you know, and all those things.  And we've got now to protect it, and to continue to provide services while we concentrate the assets.
Speaker 1: So what--how do you go about that?  'Cause, I mean, how do you--
Speaker 2: We restructure the--
Speaker 1: --go about--
Speaker 2: We restructure the board.
Speaker 1: That's what I was wondering.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So who--
Speaker 2: Now, understand this board, the [New York City] Mission Society [New York, New York] has been a historic board with what they would consider first families, okay?
Speaker 1: When you say first families?
Speaker 2: The Colgates.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?  The Rumbos.
Speaker 1: So this was good--okay.  And you have been sitting on this board.  This was a good board to be on?
Speaker 2: Well, they put me on the board for a little flavor, okay?  That--Dave Barry was very good at, at doing this, okay?  We had--the board had reached out to the Jewish community, and John Coleman [ph.] from Coleman Factors [ph.] was on it, okay?  And people from Exxon[ Mobil Corporation], some of the major corporate types were on the board.  Didn't have enough community people on the board, so we knew we had to get some people who were involved in the service delivery involved in the board because the foundations were not gonna fund the first families.  We had to decentralize the funding so that the funding could be identified as going to community base.  We consolidated the camps.
Speaker 1: When you said--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And we--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--you consolidated the camps, you consolidated their operations?
Speaker 2: No, we consolidated geo--geography and their operations.  Let me tell you about the Mission Society's camp.  The camps used to be segregated a long time ago--
Speaker 1: Before the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Before the '60s [1960s].  Minisink was the most famous black camp in America, okay?
Speaker 1: How many children would it service?
Speaker 2: Oh, it--about seven hundred a year, okay?  And Dover Plains, or Camp Green Acres, Camp Sharparoon for white kids; both of them run by the Mission Society, okay?  During the early '50s [1950s], they started integrating Sharparoon, okay?  Minisink didn't want to be integrated, okay?  They were proud of their heritage.  Minisink got started because there were no camps for black kids in the '30s [1930s], okay?  And the Mission Society pioneered the development of this camp for kids.  The black kids used to go from Harlem [New York, New York] to Dover Plains the first session, but they resented it because they had to clean up camp for the kids who came behind them, see?  So that's how the, the two camps got started.  We were able to bring them together at Dover Plains, and now it's called Camp Minisink at Dover Plains.  So the, the, the Society has many assets.
Story_ID: 192889
Speaker 1: So you took--now, is any thought about earned income and making the--or was it all provisional and all still, what would I call it?  Like the [Jane Addams] Hull House [Chicago, Illinois].  I don't remember.  I'm not using the right--was the, was the fund rai--where was--what was gonna be the ongoing source of funding coming in?  It's one thing for--
Speaker 2: We [New York City Mission Society, New York, New York] established what's called the First Person Award Dinner, which is the annual corporate dinner, and we averaged about $750,000 a year from the corporate dinner, and it was a simple model.  Dina [Merrill] got the Chairman, got the honorary, and we sold the tickets to the corporations, okay?  Oh, she was a tremendous person.  I, I can't talk enough about her commitment to the society.  Let me just regress for, for a minute.  When she married her first husband, who was a Rumbo, part of the extended Colgate family, her mother-in-law told her that no self-respecting woman is without a charity and this is yours.  And so she had been on the board forty-some years, maybe longer than that, 'cause her son's older than that, okay?  Okay.  Prior to my getting her to step up to the plate, she had not done very much, okay?  But her father is E.F. Hutton, and I told her that, you know, she's a natural corporate type and she had to be President, so she became President, and Presidents have a very important responsibility in providing the resources, and she did; both corporately and both personally.  And by the way, we got the $5,000,000 within months.
Speaker 1: So your assets were also sitting on your board?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: You just, you just activated them?
Speaker 2: They had to, they had to, they had to be activated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so you did that in a four-year period?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was there for fourteen.
Speaker 1: Fourteen.  Why am I seeing--I can't--okay.  Oh, sorry.  '78 [1978] to 1991, that's right.  Okay.  Actually, a little longer than you were then at OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And longer than I intended to stay.
Speaker 1: But you enjoyed this?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your focus back on children.
Speaker 2: Yes, and, and adults.
Speaker 1: And adu--okay.  What were the adult programs?
Speaker 2: Learning literacy programs, yeah.  Placement programs, okay?  We ran afterschool--not afterschool, but community centers.  We have three major community centers that are--
Speaker 1: And what are--okay.  The community centers are which ones?  The--
Speaker 2: The Cadet Corps in the Bronx [New York, New York], the Minisink Townhouse [Harlem, New York, New York] and Camp and the one in Queens.
Speaker 1: Now, the Minisink [Camp Minisink], it got integrated or it didn't get integrated?
Speaker 2: No. No. No. No. No.
Speaker 1: It didn't?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  I just wanted to be clear, but--
Speaker 2: These black folk were not interested.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  (laughter) And it still services about seven hundred students, you know--
Speaker 2: At the camp [Minisink], yeah.
Speaker 1: --at camp a year?  Now--
Speaker 2: Oh, but it runs a year-round program--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: -- in the city.  The Townhouse is as big as the school.
Story_ID: 192890
Speaker 1: Now, I have this--this is the question I was trying to ask, Reverend Pressley:  Things have changed, I mean, since the 1960s--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and especially, the communities have changed, the issues have changed from the time that you started with the War on Poverty Program.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I'm just--
Speaker 2: But I don't think that the issues have changed.
Speaker 1: You don't think the issues have changed?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  There's still poverty, okay?  And there's still lack of opportunity, see?  And I think that, that unless we're diligent and continue to press for them, they won't happen.  I think that the education system is worse than it was in the '60s [1960s], okay?  I think that the housing patterns worse than they were in the '60s [1960s], okay?  Now, for us, us unflappable technocrats who are the accidents of history; no, they've changed, but they haven't changed for the masses.
Speaker 1: But when I said that they've changed, there were--there are more drugs than before.  No?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes or no?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes.
Speaker 1: More drugs.
Speaker 2: Because there are more people.
Speaker 1: Right, more--okay.  And you think family structure hasn't changed a little bit?
Speaker 2: I don't think so--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --because--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I--
Speaker 2: --I knew as many for me.  I knew as many--I mean, single headed households.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think of--I mentioned these two All-Americans [Calvin Ramsey and Tom "Satch" Sanders], both of them come from single-family households, and they're sixty-six-years-old.
Speaker 1: So you--but I'm saying that there's a different Calvin Pressley at the New York City Mission [Society, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Very different.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's what I'm trying to--okay.
Speaker 2: Very different.
Speaker 1: I'm trying--well, I'm saying things have changed just period.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I would also say the community has changed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I would--
Speaker 2: And the statistics would probably bear it out.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  I would say--
Speaker 2: But I'm--but they have changed.  All I'm arguing is that the, the symptoms of this disease, this disease in communities has been there.
Speaker 1: But in the way you approach problems, those--was the, the, the situation with Dina--Dina [Merrill], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that a typical approach now, in terms of how you approached problems?  Seems to be pretty efficient, but was that--is that how you--how did you deal, because you were familiar with--you know, unlike when you were with the, you know, War on Poverty, and, you know, and were with--I--that's all I'm trying to sort of get a sense of--
Speaker 2: I, I would say that the way I approach problem solving today is that I recognize that the source of the solutions are not with me.  It's generally with other people, the peop--the people who can bring to bear their resources and their expertise in terms of solving.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--who--did you--you left the [New York City] Mission [Society, New York, New York] better than where it--when you came?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And is its base still, though--where is its base of support, you know, now?
Speaker 2: Its endowment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?
Speaker 1: You created an endowment?
Speaker 2: They, they had one, but they had spent most of the, the unrestricted part of it, okay?  And we restored it and spent ten years developing it.  It's not a big one, it's about $25,000,000 now.  And then, you know, we raised the money to--for the operation of the program, okay?  But that's the--its base of support.  It, it does receive that corporate support, and then it has a campaign for individuals.
Story_ID: 192891
Speaker 1: Then you left there [New York City Mission Society, New York, New York] and went with--now, were you thinking you were retiring at this point?
Speaker 2: No, but I needed to leave there, 'cause I had done what I could do for them, okay?  And I used the retirement to leave gracefully.
Speaker 1: And what--were you also feeling you needed a change?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did you want to do?
Speaker 2: Didn't know.  On the other hand, my church--you remember, I'm a Methodist.  They're continually looking for assignments for me to do.  You know, yeah, you're doing x, y, z.  We know you're getting a lot of visibility, and this, and that, but we need you to do this, and your hours.  Remember, we educated and provided you with these developmental tools.
Speaker 1: So where are you--you've left Brunswick, [sic, Bushwick United Methodist, Brooklyn, New York, New York] right?
Speaker 2: Bushwick [United Methodist, Brooklyn, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Bushwick.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I left them when I went to the [New York City] Mission Society [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Right.  So who--so--in this fourteen-year period with the Mission Society, they're not--you're not doing anything but the Mission Society, right?
Speaker 2: No.  A pastor dies in Harlem [New York, New York], and the Bishop wants to assign me, he's trying to tell you something.
Speaker 1: That means we have to change tapes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But the Bishop wants to assign me to the same church in Harlem--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: And I tell him no because he knows that as well as I know that I'm under obligation to the Society--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I agree to serve it until he finds somebody--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm there for fourteen months as a volunteer.
Story_ID: 192892
Speaker 1: So how does the opportunity with ICAM [Institute of Church Administration and Management], is it ICAM?
Speaker 2: ICAM.
Speaker 1: ICAM okay.
Speaker 2: On the occasion of my retirement, the [New York City] Mission Society [New York, New York] grateful for my service wanted to provide me with a year off to think about what I was going to do with the rest of my life.  On the occasion of my retirement, the Lilly Endowment [Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana] whom I had done a lot of work with mainly get grants from to work with them but I have done a lot of work with them, also wanted to provide with me a year to think about what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.  I'm fifty-five at this point.  And so, I accept and spend the first six months teaching urban ministry at the Howard [University] Divinity School [Washington, District of Columbia], okay?  I am a Scholar in Residence.  I told you I was an intellectual (laughter) at the Howard Divinity School. Dean Jones, Larry Jones and I worked out this arrangement.  I was down there four days a week.  They housed me, and I provided services free of charge.  The next semester, I thought that I would continue to teach at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] because I enjoyed that.  I enjoyed the interaction with the students, what I saw as a kind of opening them up because things had really changed in the church, rather than being social activists, they want to be empire builders or whatever.  I thought I was making a contribution.  But the Lilly Endowment, responding to a request from the Interdenominational Theological Center wanted to start a training program to help to improve the management and the technical skills of clergy persons in the theological schools, as well as practicing clergy.  And before I could get my year of thinking done, they told me that they had put this money down there and they wanted me to work with a group that I had been working with for twenty years to go and start this institute.  That was the Congress of National Black Churches, okay?  So I went to ICAM to start it.  And ICAM is the Institute of Church Administration and Management.
Speaker 1: And this was to take care of a need, a perceived need, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 192893
Speaker 1: Can you talk about what, you know, was happening within the spiritual community that there was this belief that this should occur?
Speaker 2: Well, for the leadership of the black church, they know that it's--the church is a very inefficient operation.  There is an underground economy in its money, okay?  And there needs to be an improvement in the quality of the service that it renders to the community.  The way you get that done is a retooling or re-engineering of the leadership.  They felt that I had the consummate skills to get that done.  And we worked with the board to set up process and training program that continues today.
Speaker 1: And what was the training, because we are back to training
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But we're--you know we are doing for a community that had been overlooked like you felt that the adults had been overlooked.
Speaker 2: Right. Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But this is a little different because there is not necessarily a lack of money within that community, but there may have been a lack of management skills to do them.
Speaker 2: And a lack of money that they would allocate for training.
Speaker 1: For training, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So what do you decide, you're dealing in a --
Speaker 2: I decide that the General Electric Management training model is one that I need to adapt for the local church pastor.
Speaker 1: So what does that mean?
Speaker 2: That means that I've gotta get them in a setting, first of all, that's conducive to learning, where their distractions are gone because you can't meet with preachers without them being distracted, okay?  That's the first thing I needed to do.  I needed to get them in small enough groups that are nonthreatening, okay?  Peer groups but nonthreatening peer groups.  I had to get subjects that they could identify with, okay?  So we begin with Bible, okay, as a management tool.  And we go on to taxes and a whole variety of things, somewhere around the curriculum we have--but so that was for the clergyman.  So essentially, it's a continuing education program for clergy.  It's a church administration program for theological students.  We use the same core structure but the students that were present students, we had programs for them a week before the semester starts.  This was the fall semester and a week before the spring semester starts.  They got university credit for it and an in-service training program for lay people because you train the clergy, you don't simultaneously train the lay people, you don't have a fit.  So that was a--and then we used to (unclear).  We took the program from ITC and all of the historically Black theological schools, we conducted the program there.  And then we used to do in-service workshops that I don't think much of because they're hit and miss, but we did it.
Speaker 1: What did you find the ideal size was?
Speaker 2: About seventeen.
Speaker 1: Seventeen, okay.  And how long would the trainings with the minister occur?
Speaker 2: Two.  I would want to keep them longer but two four-and-a-half day sessions.
Speaker 1: And did you find that you still had to break down some defenses?  I mean, the trust issue?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yeah, but we used to do it and we were quite successful.  We had classes of Bishops, you know, just Bishops, okay.  They were less defensive than they would be with clergymen in there so that's the kind of thing we would do.
Story_ID: 192894
Speaker 1: You went to the United Methodist City Society [New York, New York] and so you're sort of back home?
Speaker 2: Back in New York [New York].  Back home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did you do there?
Speaker 2: There is the story of how I got there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The Director, my predecessor there, is now two years beyond retirement.  The retirement age is seventy, okay.  He is seventy-two.  They have been after me for two years to come.  Reverend [Dr. William M.] James is the chairman of the personnel committee, okay?  So they wear me and Iona [Pressley] down, is essentially what they do, and I agree to go back to New York to head the Society really as a transition thing.  I figured I'd give 'em five to eight years and retire finally period but then I had some health challenges and I had to come out on disability retirement in December, but the Society, again, is an old, historic, now Methodist, social service agency doing a lot of the things that the Mission Society did but on a much smaller basis and for the United Methodist Church.  The mission is to keep the one hundred seventeen churches in New York City actively involved in outreach to the community, and the response is uneven but that's one of those things.
Speaker 1: Because people feel a lot pressures these days?
Speaker 2: Feel a lot of pressure but more than that, the clergy have a different orientation into their ministries.
Speaker 1: Well, can we talk about that a little bit too because there is, you know, the ministry has changed a lot and I think it has changed outside of the--you have your traditional ministries and, correct me if I'm wrong, but you have your traditional denominations, I should just say.  But there are others that have come outside of the traditional that are just making a lot of money and they have these huge congregations.  They are like cities (laughs).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I think I take a different analytical view of where they are.  See, part of the problem, I think, is that too many of the clergy today perceive themselves as priests rather than prophets and certainly not pastors, okay?  And they are more interested in the ceremonial aspects of ministry rather than the service, okay?  And the confrontational aspects of God against the society, see.  God doesn't like what we doin', okay, but when you listen to the [Jerry] Falwells of the world, God's on their side.  God's no more on their side than anybody else's.  He don't like what the whole society is doin' including the priests, and we been here before with Israel.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My point is that until the clergy gets reoriented into the notion that their function is a service function and a redemptive function on behalf of God, not much is going to take place in the life of the church that is creative.
Speaker 1: So then let me first ask you the definition of Priest versus Prophet versus Pastor.
Speaker 2: Okay, the Priests serve in a ceremonial capacity.  They administer the sacraments, okay?  They provide the show.  They do what I call the church show.  The Prophets challenge the systems of injustice, okay?  And confront the people with their sin, okay?  The Pastors are in need of providing succor and care for the people.  You get these people in these mega churches and they can't get their pastors to bury 'em.  I bury a lot of 'em all the time.  So those are the distinctions that I make.
Story_ID: 192895
Speaker 1: So speaking then, because you're talking about the issues of today which you say really, you believe haven't really changed all that much in terms of people's psyche and need.  I mean, I keep thinking about your first--well, your first clinical training being on the psych ward and we are at a time when--
Speaker 2: Well, let me put it this way, if you got one schizophrenic, the symptom is there.  If you have ten, you just have ten schizophrenics.  It hasn't changed quantumly, I guess so, yes; but the issues have been there since the beginning of time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I understand that perspective.  So the issues are there since the beginning of time.  For those people who are training in seminary, what is your belief about--and maybe you saw some of how maybe some of the training has changed when you were at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] or at least how the school population of those future seminarians of what they are looking for, but what is your belief about what aspect of the training, you know, what things are critical for training in the seminary in today's world?
Speaker 2: A re-orientation to the institution.  Most of the people, not most, but too many of the people come to the seminary--Remember, I told you it was a professional school, okay, with no notion of what the institutional church is.  They come because they are looking for spiritual development and seminaries don't do that.  That is why the dropout rates are very high.  They're coming looking to learn more about the Bible.  You take one Bible course in the seminary.  You put that Bible down and you don't want to ever pick it up again because they tell you about the ten different varieties that wrote this verse.  See, so their expectations of seminary but most of them don't come from a church background.  They want to be spiritual and that's something different.
Speaker 1: What in your definition is coming from a church background versus being spiritual?  I just want to understand what--
Speaker 2: All right.  We have a formal organized system of developmental professional Christians of clergy, who move through the organized ranks of our church and most churches have this.  Some Baptist churches don't have it, but then they do have an ordination process.  That's what seminaries do.  They just don't train good people.  There are plenty of good people who don't need to be in seminary, plenty of good Christians, plenty of good Protestants, Catholics who don't need to be in seminary, okay, because that's not what it does.  It's designed to move the institution to new levels of service.
Speaker 1: Seminary is designed to move the institution to new levels--
Speaker 2: The church as an institution to new levels of service.
Speaker 1: --through people who are Priest, Prophet and Pastor.  You didn't know that when you were entering seminary?
Speaker 2: No, absolutely not.
Speaker 1: And when Reverend [Dr. William M.] James tapped you, you did not.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I did not know.
Speaker 1: So you were as guilty as the students that you are speaking in front of.
Speaker 2: But I had come through the church--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and had an obligation to the church.
Speaker 1: Felt an obligation?
Speaker 2: Felt an obligation.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you believe that's sort of critical in terms of the religious--okay, in terms of training.

Speaker 1: What about the whole issue of a church as a social activist?  What are your perceptions there about, you know, what is occurring, even you know because the needs are still there?
Speaker 2: I think that the most effective institutions are balanced institutions and they have to keep the balance of their social activism, the pastoral care and their service.
Speaker 1: And who do you think does that effectively these days?  Which of the institutions?
Speaker 2: I think that there are more individual institutions doing it than denominations per se.  The denominations have moved to a kind of grouping.  Now, I could point to our church.  We know how much money we spend for social action.  How much money from--talking about the denomination and they are large numbers.  The Roman Catholics can tell you, but that doesn't translate to service on the ground and it's service on the ground that I'm interested in.
Speaker 1: And who do you see doing service on the ground very well these days?
Speaker 2: You mentioned Floyd.  Floyd does a good job, but he's not the only one, okay?  There is a guy named Bernard in Brooklyn [New York, New York].  He does a good job.  Guy in Riverside [New York, New York]; he doesn't get the recognition for it but he does a good job.  There are plenty of places.  Not enough.
Speaker 1: So do you believe that the denominations are still necessary outside of the infrastructure.
Speaker 2: They're not going to go away.
Speaker 1: They're not going to go away.  Okay.
Speaker 2: It's too much vested interest in them.
Speaker 1: Like the political parties.
Speaker 2: Like the pension program.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughing) okay, I see.
Speaker 2: Not much more practical than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now, when you look at the African American community, what hopes and concerns do you have for that community?
Speaker 2: See I think that the African American community ought not abandon the quest for justice for all people, okay?  It is not going to happen for the African American community alone.  It may not happen for all people but if you start believing that you can be population specific with truth and justice will never happen, okay?  So you need to have a broad universal view.  Now, you take what's happening to us in Iraq and Iran and places like that.  We have discounted the humanity of those people.  You're not gonna get no justice in America.  It ain't gonna happen.  See?  So the church has to rekindle the moral high ground for the nation and it hasn't.  It has bought in to that might been.
Speaker 1: And do you think that someone who was, like yourself, very involved in the Civil Rights Movement and the programs that came out of that movement.  Do you seek on hindsight say that something should have been done differently or that there were some missed opportunities?
Speaker 2: There are lots of missed opportunities.  I don't think that we organized well enough, okay.  The different aspects of our revolutionary design, okay.  You had segments of the movement not communicating with each other, you know.  Some people want to shake the trees and no one gonna pick up the apples.  The people who pick up the apples wanna know who they gonna share 'em with because these folks shook the trees.  So those were it.  And the politicians.  In New York City [New York], I know how all of them got elected, okay?  They forgot.  But any time you move into the notion of entitlement, you're on very shaky ground for community renewal and change.
Speaker 1: So what issues would you say are number one issues that have to be addressed in our community then if there were lost opportunities, some mistakes?
Speaker 2: The restoration of civility in the first one, okay?  And the appreciation for the other and adding neighbor to the common notion that it's a hood.  You know what they've done with the popular music, they talk about the hood and forget the neighbor.

Speaker 1: And, Reverend Pressley, if you were coming along today and Reverend [Dr. William M.] James had tapped you in the same way, what would you be doing?
Speaker 2: If I were younger?
Speaker 1: If you were younger.
Speaker 2: I would probably try to do it much the same way but I would try to be more efficient in doing it because what we didn't talk about, and I'm not sure we're going to put it on your tape, of how inefficient we may have been in this journey and I have regrets about that.
Speaker 1: Well, that was one of the questions I had asked about the inefficiency.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You don't want to put that on the tape?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm talking about a personal inefficiency.
Speaker 1: Personal inefficiency.  You mean you?
Speaker 2: Yes and personal things and personal time that I could have saved for service.
Speaker 1: You mean, if you had been more efficient with how you spent your time and who you spent it with.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You could have served more?
Speaker 2: More, yes.  Oh, yes, without a doubt.
Speaker 1: But you served a great deal also.
Speaker 2: That's true but, you know, our purpose, we're back to that.  I spent some time serving me, probably too much.
Speaker 1: So that's a regret?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what, Reverend Pressley, what do you want to do that you haven't done then?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you, the easy answer is to get something down on paper so that people might be able to use it so that they could be more efficient personally. That's the easy answer.  The more difficult one is that it's hard to focus on the right things to get them down in some manageable proportions, but I'm working on it.

Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity].
Speaker 2: I'd be glad to talk about the Boule.  That's my volunteer effort.
Speaker 1: Right, and your leadership.  You've been a Boule since what year?
Speaker 2: '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: '78 [1978].  Wasn't that the year that you went to New York City Mission [Society, New York New York]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You want to talk about the organization and a little about its history?
Speaker 2: Sure.  The Boule was started as the outlet for some professional men in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], African American professional men in Philadelphia, who had no social outlet to people that they considered to be their peers professionally, okay?  And so they modeled this Greek letter organization after the organization of Greek society, and it was called a Boule which was the association of essentially citizens, okay?  But everybody couldn't be a citizen but those who were citizens were considered equal, absolutely equal, okay?  And it provided them a place around which they could gather for educational inspiration and for social events, okay?  And it was a semi-secret organization.  The genius of it is they felt that it need not be local, that there were people who were likeminded across the country that they could get together with in a fraternal bond of union.  Was it intended to be elitist?  The answer is yes, okay?  Was it intended to provide service?  The answer is no, okay?  It was to meet the needs of the membership.  Okay, however defined.  And so it has evolved being fairly schizophrenic about what it ought to do because while we have social action in public policy and programs, okay, there is no definitive pattern of what Boule's do across the country.  There are about four thousand members.  Some people say that we're the talented tenth.  Well, there are certainly more than four thousand talented tenth people across the country, so it could be a little larger, okay?  There is always resistance.
Story_ID: 428710
Speaker 1: You said that you know that the tendency is to draw the bridge behind you?
Speaker 2: The bridge behind you and say nobody else is worthy but that's the way you kill institutions and the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] is an institution we need to keep, okay?  I think we need to keep it.  I think that the community needs it because of the question of civility.  I just think that we need a counter balance to, and I'm not against hip-hop but the notion of where it takes our community, we need a counter balance to it.  So we've got to get younger.  The Boule is a graying organization, okay, so we've got to get younger.  We've got to be more public, and I think that parts of the fraternity agree with me.  I wanted to be the grand sire archon, the president during our centennial year because I wanted to put in place some things that might guarantee our future.  Part of that is continuing growth and expansion, okay.  Part of it is how we intentionally impact on our culture and our local communities.  And I think we have to not accidentally do it, we have to be intentional about it.
Speaker 1: So talk a little bit more about the legacy of the organization and, you know, I mean I know that there is a conflict in the organization between how much is known and how much is not known but what has been the culture and who have been some of the members over the years, you know.  And what I think, you know, this was also an organization where people, you know, it represented a different time.  Some people might say the time is not all that different, a different time where you know men in the larger world may not have been considered men but they needed to fraternize, a place that they could sort of fraternize and be comfortable, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But can you talk a little bit about what it even means to be a Boule member?
Speaker 2: Well, understand that when you get outside of the major metropolitan areas, the intimacy of fraternity is far greater than it is in the larger metropolitan areas and they do a lot of things together, okay, which I think is a positive.  If you don't do it, like the exclusion of the benefits that your community might derive from your having an existence.  We'll go in any community across the country, and if there is a community leader of some educational background, you have to be a college graduate, and some service to his community and some leadership in his professional, you see you just can't be a doctor, you have to you know provide some leadership to that community and the doctors will be the first to tell you, you know.  If that's the test, then that person would be in the Boule. Okay.  Meaning, that you have ready access to the leadership across the country.  Now, how you choose to use it, the young people wanna use it on an entrepreneurial basis.  They want to use it as a network.  Some of the older people will resent that because they didn't network in those terms before.  Not that networking is a bad idea, you know, you get any MBA graduate they want to network, that's what they want to do.  Lawyers want to network.  The doctors want to consult.  But I think that it's a matter of style, okay?  Style is very important to the Boule.  Somebody once told me well, you criticize style but style is more important than substance.  (laughing)  But as for naming names, I got the directory here, we could go through it, but I'm not sure that would add to our interview as such.
Story_ID: 428711
Speaker 1: How are you going to bring these disparate forces together?  I mean, how are you going to recruit from the young who want to network and bring in the value of a civil society from the older members and make that work?
Speaker 2: I'm big on collaboration.  I'm good on group process, okay?  And I manage a fairly good interactive meeting so those are the tools that I will use.
Speaker 1: And what do you think that you know?  I'm going to ask you about your legacy, but I want to first ask you about the legacy of the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity]?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because, you know, there are other--I mean, like, someone would say well what is the difference between the Boule and the Masons, you know, except the Mason's probably were more average Joe's.  But, you know, what's the difference, it was secret, there was ceremony, there was, you know, funny names.  You know, what's the difference?  Or what is the difference between Kappa and Omega and Boules?  So why should it still exist as an organization and what in turn what is its legacy?
Speaker 2: I think it's family orientation is not given enough credit because it is a family oriented organization.  I don't know about the Masons.  I don't know about the Kappas.  I know about the hundred Black men, used to be a member.  But I think that those who attend the Boule have special feelings about the relationships that they have within the organization.
Speaker 1: And what special feeling do you have, Reverend Pressley?
Speaker 2: When I was asked to join the Boule, I didn't know what it was.  I had never heard of it, okay?  You interviewed Dr. Sheldon [ph.] and Dr. Sheldon and I were not personal friends when he nominated me for the Boule.  He saw qualities within me that would add to the depth, I hope, of the fraternity.  And that's why he nominated me, made me aware of the nomination, and that's how I was inducted.  I have gained a personal friend and, remember, that's twenty-some years ago.  He had operated on my son's foot.  Both of us have flat feet, by then to correct it, okay, and we knew we had mutual acquaintances but we did not have a relationship, see?  And I think that it is that kind of appraisal that takes place in Boule recruitment that has a good feeling for me.  My inclination, given my orientation, would be to say I don't join secret organizations; but my respect for him as a professional rather than as a friend, because I did not know him, opened up a continuous set of relationships that I have enjoyed over the past twenty years.  So that's my feeling about the Boule, and for a church person, I go to conventions all the time and that's the last thing I need is another convention, another meeting to go to; but there is a sense of fellowship that I receive there that I don't get in other places and I'm committed to increasing the quality of the events.
Speaker 1: Reverend Pressley, its--you are a long way from 120th [Street] and Madison [Avenue] [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Accidently so.  But I thank God for the accident.
Story_ID: 428712
Speaker 1: And also for mentors, too, like Reverend [Dr. William M.] James, that's right.  So when you look back at yourself as a young boy, the brat as you said you were (laughing), and the journey that you have had along the way, and the commitment to service that you have exhibited, what have been the ingredients in what has kept you, you know, centered once you found--you know, it took you time, like people in life, you know, kids it takes time to find if you're lucky to find one center.  So here as a child, you said, could have been all over the place.
Speaker 2: All over the place, dead, on drugs, all of that is possible because all those temptations were there and were there big time and had to be beaten away.  I'm sure I'm not a drug addict today because of another accident, I guess, and that accident is I was afraid of needles, you know.  But it also impacted on my dental work, and now I got mouthful of--I got an expensive mouth because I was afraid of needles because I had opportunities to take drugs and wouldn't take 'em just because of the needles, you see.  So you never know what this life has in store for you, but my motto would be try to be faithful of a few things.  That's all.
Speaker 1: And your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know what that means.
Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for though?
Speaker 2: I'd like my wife [Iona Pressley] to believe that I loved her, and that I tried to provide for her, and that I respected her.  I'd like my offspring to believe that I respected them, and I tried to provide every opportunity so they could be what they wanted to be, not what I wanted them to be, what they wanted to be.  That I may have been a hard task master but the challenge was for their benefit, not my ego.
Speaker 1: And your tombstone should say?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.  Hope springs eternal.

VIDEOGRAPHER:  Tell us a little about the photo, please?
Speaker 2: Well, this photograph is of the New York City Mission Society's annual luncheon back in the early '60s [1960s].  It was a luncheon that brought together some of the Pastoral leadership of the community, some of the ladies who did charitable work for the Society, the gentlemen--the African American gentleman you see in the middle is Calvin Pressley, who was a much younger model than he is today.  This luncheon ultimately involved-- evolved under the leadership of the Society during the '80s [1980s] and the '90s [1990s] to be our annual first person award dinner, which was a major fundraiser and continues today where we average some $750,000 as an annual contribution to the Society's work.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Who's this?
Speaker 2: That's Iona's [Pressley] aunt, but the young lady in the yellow dress and the white bonnet is Miss Peyton Olivia Pressley.  That's the granddaughter of Iona and Calvin Pressley, the daughter of Todd and Noma Tamba-Pressley. Obviously, there is some sacrilege here because she has become the center of the universe.
Speaker 1: (Laughing).
