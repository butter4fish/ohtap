 Neurohr  McAfee  Today is October 16, 2009. My name is Karen Neurohr and I   m a  librarian for Oklahoma State University Library. I   m at the  ConocoPhillips Alumni Center with Mr. Ronald McAfee. I   m going to  interview Mr. McAfee for an oral history project which is titled O-STATE  Stories. This is a project for the OSU Library and the Oklahoma  Oral History Research Program. Thank you, Mr. McAfee, for  participating in our interview today.  You   re welcome.  Now I understand you   re back on campus this weekend for your 50 year  class reunion, is that correct?  That   s correct. Actually 51st because I graduated in both    58 and    59.  Oh, you did.  So my 50th was last year.  So that was for your bachelor   s degree?  Yes.  And then you stayed here   ?  Stayed here and got my master   s a year later.  What was your bachelor   s degree in?  It was in psychology and my master   s was in psychology also. I got a  deferment from the military to stay an extra year and get my master   s  before I went into the Air Force. So they graciously allowed me to do  5  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  that from ROTC. I was in ROTC.  And then you went on and achieved another degree, as well?  I got a PhD degree from the University of Texas after I left the Air  Force. Left the Air Force in    62 and then went to the University of Texas  from    62 to    64 and earned my PhD down there in psychology also.  Well congratulations. You have a lot of academic accomplishments.  Well, had a lot of kids and stuff at the same time so it was a mess.  Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up and about your  early life?  I grew up in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and went through all the public  school system there in Oklahoma City. A lot of the friends that I still  have now are people that I knew from high school. I guess at that time  that was considered a big city, you know, for Oklahoma, anyway.  What high school did you go to?  Classen High School   what they call the Old Classen High School  there. Now it   s a school for advanced studies or something. It   s not even  a high school as we knew it at the time.  What did your parents do?  Well my dad worked for the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company and  my mother worked for IRS, and they both retired from those facilities.  My parents divorced when I was six years old but they both were in the  same area so I saw both. I lived with my mother but saw my father  because he lived in the area.  Where do you live now?  We live in Edmond, Oklahoma, which was a suburb of Oklahoma City.  It   s changed a little hasn   t it?  It   s grown a great deal since we moved there.  What influenced you to enroll at OSU?  Well I went to Rush Week up here and at OU also. I had some good  friends up here that I had gone through high school with, we actually  6  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  went to the same church and they were in different fraternities up here.  And then another one of my good friends was in the fraternity down  there in Norman. So I went to both places for Rush Week   not Rush  Week but Rush parties   and just really fell in love with Stillwater, just  liked the atmosphere. We always thought of OU as too haughty and so  on. We liked the down home atmosphere and everyone was friendly up  here. I just really had a good time, good experience with the Rush Week  and the campus. The campus was really beautiful back then as it still is  now but we thought it was probably prettier back then. Anyway, just  really was a good experience.  Which fraternity did you end up in?  Ended up pledging Kappa Sig which was interesting because the two  guys that I came up here to Rush parties with were not in Kappa Sig,  they were in two other fraternities. It was almost like, I didn   t want to  hurt either one of their feelings so it   s like I kind of went the middle  ground here, but it was the right experience for me.  Tell me a little bit about your fraternity experience.  Well that was really a good experience for me. It helped mature me in  ways and helped me gain confidence in ways. Our first year we lived in  Thatcher Hall because they were building the Kappa Sig house in    54  when I first came up here, so we lived in Thatcher Hall for a year. And  then we moved into the house that next year in    55 and, of course, it was  nice having new rooms and new everything because it was a new  facility. You know, the fraternity back then had a lot of structure in it.  You couldn   t have booze in the rooms or girls in the rooms or anything  that they   re allowing, apparently, now on campus.  I think alcohol is banned from the houses, I believe.  Well that   s good. When did they do that?  When my son was here, he was a Fiji. He came in    98 and I know when  he was a student here I remember him saying it was banned.  Well good, I   m glad to hear that.  I don   t know if it   s still that way or not.  Yeah. Anyway, then it was definitely banned. And of course we had a  house mother, I guess everybody else did. We dressed up a lot more then  than the kids do now. We had to dress up to go to the football games, for  example. They had us wearing, particularly the pledges and stuff, you   d  7  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  have to wear suits and things to the football games and dress up for  basketball games. You couldn   t go in your jeans and that type of thing.  So they tried to instill a little bit of culture in us at that point in time, 50  years ago, but it was good training and good experience.  I looked at some of the yearbooks yesterday and I saw that there were  several pages where students had on beanies. Can you tell me about  that?  I don   t remember many beanies when I was there. May have been there  and I just don   t remember.  I think it was for the freshmen or something.  I don   t remember having to do that in    54 when I was there. Maybe I  blocked it out from my consciousness. I   m a hat guy and I like to wear  hats because of my haircut now but I don   t remember that.  What was life like in the fraternity house?  Well it was just a lot of camaraderie there because everybody really got  along well with each other and worked together like on the Homecoming  floats and things like that that we have going on now. You form close  bonds with common interests and participation. You had regularly  scheduled meals that you had to be there at a certain time and again help  build some structure in your life. If you want to eat you get there at a  certain time and you had to help with the dishes and different things. So  again you felt a commitment to the fraternity that you were in because  you felt like you were helping it grow and prosper and so on. And then  they taught us manners and things we had to do with the house mother to  escort her and take care of her and make sure the knives and forks and  all that were in the right places as we set the table and things that you  could have learned at home but may not have learned at home. So it  helped with our cultural education, I guess. It was just a very, very good  experience.  Some of the guys that I was close to then I still see now and in fact last  week we had our pledge class, some of the guys that were in our pledge  class that live in Oklahoma and one guy was coming in from Arizona.  We all got together for lunch and had a visit for four hours. So there are  still bonds that you feel even though you don   t see some of those people  often. A couple of them are guys that I still go hunting with and interact  with, go to the same church with. So those are bonds that we still have,  we still feel as we go back over old experience and things we had to do  and what we did do as pledges and so on.  8  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  You mentioned Homecoming and floats. Did you all do house  decorations and floats?  We did more floats than house decorations then. And I remember  staying up nights poking all the crepe in the chicken wire there to make  the floats work and all that stuff. Of course, the engineers   I   m not  mechanically inclined at all but we had engineers in there that were and  so they could help get all that designed. Particularly as a pledge you had  a lot of work to do to make the floats beautiful and it was a lot of fun  and hard work. Everybody griped about it but still everybody enjoyed it  and particularly enjoyed the end results and seeing what happened. But  that was a big part of the tradition even back in those days.  Was there a Homecoming theme back then like there is today?  I don   t remember there being. There may have been. Probably, you   d  think there would be but I couldn   t remember what they were.  Were there some other traditional events at your house?  Well, we always had several dances a year that our fraternity put on.  One I think that we helped do was campus wide that we had. They were  always a big deal back then. We   d have to dress up and this type of thing  and so that was really a lot of fun and we enjoyed all those types of  activities. Then Sadie Hawkins Day dance.  Could you explain that? I think some young people today probably don   t  know what that is.  Well, that is, of course, Sadie Hawkins of Lil Abner fame would invite  the guy to the dance, so the girls would invite the fellows to the dances  and stuff on Sadie Hawkins Day. And then a lot of them would go the  whole route of wearing their suspenders and overalls and put freckles on  their face and do the different things that you would do to make it kind  of a fun time. Of course back then, there were many more boys than  girls at OSU. I bet it was four to one, boys to girls. So, you know, it was  quite an honor to get somebody to invite you to the Sadie Hawkins  dance. But it was a lot of fun and everybody got into the act and it was  very enjoyable.  Was there Freshman Follies or Varsity Revue going on?  Yes, Varsity Revue and I don   t remember Freshman Follies but for sure  there was Varsity Revue. It seems like we won it one year but we  participated in it, I think, every year and we always enjoyed that. Some  of us, like me, are not at all actors, but we still enjoyed it. And I can   t  9  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  sing either but I   d have to sing with the group so it   d drown out your  voice with the rest of them that could sing. We   d have a lot of fun. That  was a lot of time and practice. Sometimes you would do that with some  sororities, as I recall. And the Varsity Revue was really probably one of  the biggest things, besides Homecoming, that took place when I was  here. That was something you just didn   t miss and it would last for three  or four days, usually. Everybody just really, really enjoyed it. And there  was really some good talent up here, not just in our fraternity but all the  sororities and fraternities had some really great talent, some great singers  and dancers and just some well performed acts and songs. We did Music  Man one year, I remember,    66 Trombones.    I still remember the song.  Please don   t ask me to sing it. (Laughs)  That was my next question. (Laughs) What about Spring Sing?  I don   t remember Spring Sing.  What about Parent   s Weekend?  We had Parent   s Weekend as I recall and I remember Dad coming up  here a couple of times. I don   t know if that was just Father   s Day or  Parent   s Weekend but I don   t remember that being a real big deal.  Did you just have one house mom at the house that you were in?  Yes.  What can you tell me about her? What was her name?  Mrs. Bea. Mother Bea. I don   t remember her last name to be honest with  you. She had a room there in the fraternity and that   s where she lived  and stayed and we   d all have to escort her everywhere she   d go if she  went shopping or whatever, we   d take her, special things we   d take her.  And then every night we   d see her at the table and things would kind of  revolve around her. She would be there if you needed some counseling  or needed somebody to talk to and so on. Everybody respected her. It  was a good deal to have a house mother there in the fraternity. I guess  they   re still doing it now. I hope they don   t do away with that.  I think there   s a lot of value to that they recognize. And sometimes I  think it   s house parents.  Arnold was her name. Bea Arnold was her name.  Yesterday when we were interviewing the women of Willard, which your  wife was in that group, some of the stories that I was hearing about their  10  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  house mother seemed like it was a little different type of relationship  than what the fraternities experienced with their house moms. Would  you agree with that?  Well, just some things that I heard from some different ones, you never  did hear many of the girls talking too positively, in my opinion, about  some of the house mothers there so I don   t think they had the same  relationships with them that probably we did because we were really  kind of responsible for her, for our house mothers, their well-being.  They didn   t just take off and go somewhere. We   d accompany them or  take them and things like that. And I was a house boy at the Chi-O house  also and, of course, they had a house mother there too and she was  treated the same way, very courteously by everybody, all the Chi-Os at  that time when I was there, so it was a good situation.  Well when you were house boy back in the late    50s, what did that  mean? What were your duties?  You   d help prepare the meals, you   d serve the girls. You   d clean the  table off while they   re there and serve them the coffee and all this type  of thing. You end up being a house boy I   d get my three meals a day at  the house, at the Chi-O house, so that saved me the money of having to  pay it at the Kappa Sig house the couple of years I was doing it. I was  financially always on the edge so that was a big savings to be able to do  that and I met some real good friends there that I still see and interact  with. In fact we even play bridge with one of them that was a Chi-O at  the time that I met there.  Was it three meals a day that you were involved in that?  Yes, yes. It seemed like Monday night was the night they always had  formal time so all the girls would put their best clothes on and we   d have  to dress up a little bit and serve. But we always saw them at their very  best then, so that was nice. Then at breakfast we saw them at their worst,  I guess you would say. (Laughs) Some of them didn   t fix themselves up  very well.  Was it on the weekends as well?  Yes, as I recall. I don   t think it was Sunday. I don   t think Sunday but I  believe the other six days we did.  Do you have any favorite memories of living in the Kappa Sig house?  Well they were all pretty favorable and I don   t know that I have any that  really stand out because the whole experience was a pleasant experience.  11  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  I guess one of the favorite things was that our whole pledge class would  go on a pledge retreat and we   d capture one of the members to go with  them and usually it was a member that we liked so we   d take them with  us on our pledge sneak, it was called. We have a lot of fond memories  from that. Kind of go down there and let your hair down, do things that  you probably wouldn   t be able to do on campus in terms of drinking at  that time. Oklahoma was a dry state for the first two years that I was in  school and then they voted that out in the last two. You would have to  go to Ark City   there   d be somebody you   d send up to Ark City to buy  the liquor, Ark City, Kansas. Bring it back down and sell it, which you  weren   t supposed to do, but for certain parties away from the campus  they   d have it. That   s probably not a good chapter.  Well I think that it happened.  Yeah.  Were there any classes or professors that stand out in your memory in  particular when you were here?  Well, I guess most of them would probably be the ones that I spent more  time with in graduate school when I did my master   s here because  you   re required to spend more time with them in training and this type of  thing. John Drevdahl, Dr. Drevdahl, who was the first clinical  psychologist that they ever had on staff here and he came, I guess, the  year before I entered the master   s program. He was a very  knowledgeable guy but also had some issues of his own at that time and  then there several others. Roy Gladstone, I don   t know if he still lives  here in Stillwater or not, but anyway he was one of the professors that I  spent a good deal of time with. And Dr.  William  Griffiths was head of  the department at that time, physiological psychology was his big thing.  And then one guy that I probably spent more time with and I   m blocking  on his name now, but he was probably more responsible for me  surviving the master   s program and getting through and all that stuff.  I   m sorry I can   t remember his name. I probably spent more time with  those professors than I did in undergraduate work just because there you  just basically went to class and did your work and didn   t have any  interaction with the professors much, other than just seeing them on  campus or something.  Was it a rigorous program?  Well it was. It took a lot of dedicated time to do it. Not much time for  goofing off so your graduate year was definitely not your play year. In  fact, I lived off campus the year I was studying, getting my master   s  degree. Went out of the house and one of my fraternity brothers and I  12  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  rented a little house while we both did our last year, my graduate year  and his senior year, basically. So we could still walk from campus,  somewhere around Seventh and Pine or Seventh and Gray or something  like that. I can   t remember the street now.  Were you working when you were in graduate school?  No, other than what I did in the summers and then the advance ROTC,  so I got some money coming in from that but I didn   t actually have to  have a job that took time away from it during that year anyway, thank  goodness. I   d never have been able to do it in a year if I   d had to work.  My father was able to help a little bit there so it made a difference.  Do any Homecoming memories stand out to you in particular?  Not really. I mean they   ve always, again for me, been a very pleasant  experience. I enjoyed the floats back when I was making them and  enjoyed the floats and house decorations when I   ve seen them. I   ve  enjoyed meeting all the people that I   ve had relationships with over the  years and seeing them. So they all stand out and none of them are really  unique for me anyway. Just all been a good experience.  Did you see Frank Eaton on campus occasionally?  You   d see him at the games, et cetera. But no, didn   t just see him  walking around the campus or things like that.  Where was he at the games?  Well I think they   d have him sometimes down on the field and make  reference to him and this type of thing. He was fairly old then, you  know, so he wasn   t just roaming around much.  What other campus activities or organizations were you involved in?  I don   t think a whole lot, really. I spent most of my time studying and  fooling around, I guess, with the activities. I was our pledge class  president and I was the social chairman for our fraternity for several  years and I really didn   t get involved in campus politics. I had nothing  against it. I just didn   t have a desire to do that. I was in the psychology  club but there wasn   t really anything I did that would be noteworthy in  volunteering at that point in time.  How about any kind of intramural sports or anything?  I played on our softball team and the wrestling team that we had. Never  13  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  good at either one of them but they had to have some fillers and I was  usually a filler on the team. So I enjoyed it and enjoyed watching the  games but never was much of an athlete.  What were you favorite hangouts on campus or off campus?  Well, of course my favorite hangouts probably would have been   I had  several buddies that really loved to go fishing and hunting while I was  here. So usually when I had downtime we would do that. We   d go to  some of these ponds around or areas around or even that area on the  other side of Boomer Lake and things along that line. So didn   t really  hang out much elsewhere because when I had time to hangout that   s  usually what I did. Or, of course, dates and stuff. We had so many  parties and those consumed a lot of time. The parties   being social  chairman I had a lot of time responsible for getting all the arrangements  done for all of our parties and formals and stuff that we did so that took  a lot of time the couple years that I did that. And then of course working  at the Chi-O house took quite a bit of time so I stayed very busy, didn   t  really have time to go out to the movies much. You   d do some of that  but not really anything of consequence.  When you say hunting, what were you hunting?  Oh, we   d go duck hunting, we   d go rabbit hunting. A good friend and I  both enjoyed that. We went frog hunting, we   d try to catch the frogs  with travel hooks and a red cloth on the end of it on a long pole in some  ponds we had around. Again, those were things that I really enjoyed  doing. It was a diversion from school and responsibility, basically. So  just things along that line.  Did you attend some of the sporting events on campus?  Went to nearly all of them. I loved the wrestling, and the basketball,  football. Didn   t really attend baseball but I was very diligent about going  to those three sport activities. Back then, the arena would be full when  we had wrestling matches. Unfortunately now they   re not, there doesn   t  seem to be that same interest among the students. But we went always to  those and, of course, the basketball arena was much smaller then and it  was always filled with students and activities and this type of thing. So  yes, I attended all of those types of activities.  Did you wrestle in high school?  No, no, again, I was a filler. Had to have somebody at a certain weight  here to do it and so, you know, particularly as a pledge you   d have to go  fill in some of these things.  14  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Did you have a car when you were a student here?  I did. I had a    48 Plymouth. That got me back and forth with some  friends, some of the Chi-O   s I would take back and forth to Oklahoma  City when I   d go. It wasn   t much of one but it did have wheels and it   d  get me around.  What about the library, did you spend much time in the library?  I spent more time in the library during my graduate year than any other  time. I spent a lot of time there at that point in time. Of course, you   d  spend time there on research and stuff. But you know, they had required  study hall at the Kappa Sig house so we could study in our rooms and  it   d be quiet there most of the time for that so we had a good place to  study there in the Kappa Sig house without having to go to the library  unless you had to go do the research. I did spend an awful lot of time  there my senior year and my graduate year.  Do you have any particular stories or anything about the library? Did  you have a favorite place that you liked to go and study?  My problem with the library was that I would often see a pretty girl and  then it   d be hard for me to concentrate on what I was supposed to do  because I was checking her out and how can I meet her and stuff like  that. It was pretty dumb, but anyway.  So it was a distraction     One of the problems with the library was that.  So the pretty girls were going to the library then.  Some of them were, yes.  What do you think it is about Oklahoma State that sparks the loyalty of  the students and the alumni?  I think one of the things that helps is that we   re a little bit isolated and I  think because of that people stay on campus and do things more on  campus than around, compared to a lot of other universities that there   s  more things they can go someplace else and do. Here it   s kind of like  you   re just a huge family and everybody stays around and does things  together and goes to the parties, dances and what have you. And the  Allied Arts, I guess they still have Allied Arts here, but those are kind of  big deals that you go to and I think that helps build a camaraderie among  the group even though you don   t necessarily know all the people here  15  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  but still you have that same common experience, common bond. You  realize what everyone else is also experiencing and going through. And I  think that   s one of the beauties of Stillwater and OSU. That   s why it   s  always been such a friendly place. People come and even people from  Georgia that were here commented to us, we stopped and talked to them  and they talked about how friendly this place was and we made them  feel welcome and they didn   t feel they were in hostile territory and  things like that. That felt good to hear from people outside that would  make comments like that and, of course, we   d brag on the university and  the library and all the other good things that we have here.  How has attending OSU impacted your life?  Well I guess the biggest impact was that   s where I met my wife, my wife  of 50 years; that was the biggest impact on my life then and now. Again,  just the friends formed here and the associations and the feeling of, I  guess, one-ness with the university were all things that had very positive  influence, giving me self-confidence and helping with my formative  years, so to speak, and it was just a real good experience overall.  Can you tell me anything about your career? You earned your PhD in  psychology. Were you a practicing psychologist for many years then?  Yes, after I graduated from the University of Texas   well and while I  was in the Air Force for those three years I was at Travis Air Force Base  neuropsychiatric hospital there out in Fairfield, California, which was a  great experience and then   that was just with a master   s degree. Then  after Texas I came here and started the Bethany Guidance Center in  Oklahoma City which was a child and family oriented outpatient clinic  for families. I was there a couple of years and then was promoted to  director of the state program through the State Health Department and  helped develop these counseling centers throughout the state of  Oklahoma. Like there   s one, Payne County Guidance Center here in  Stillwater, that was one of them that we helped develop. I stayed at SHD  twenty-something years and then left and went into private practice for  awhile and I worked as executive director of the Oklahoma Christian  Counseling Center there in Oklahoma City over by Mercy Hospital, I  did that for about ten years. I retired from psychology in    93 and then  started another profession after that.  What advice would you give to OSU students today?  Well, of course, the main thing is to do your studies and keep your head  on straight. Just common stuff. Don   t let the temptations of the drugs  and the alcohol and the pretty girls or handsome guys lead you astray  from what you   re here for. Basically you want to leave here with a  16  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  Neurohr  McAfee  strong degree and a focus on life that you want to pursue when you do  leave here and that you don   t have major regrets on things you did that  you   re going to be sorry for twenty, fifty years from now when you look  back on it.  I think just keeping focused and realizing why you   re here is as big a  thing for the students now as it was when we were here. I know it  sounds trite but it still is, I think, the way that it needs to be perceived.  What would you say to possible students who may be thinking about  coming to OSU?  You can   t go wrong. It   s a good place to go. You would definitely enjoy  it. You would not regret it.  Do you have family members who came here?  Yes, our sons Mark and Greg both were here and graduated from OSU.  Is there anything you   d like to add that we didn   t cover?  Well no, other than I   m hoping to get our thirteen year old  granddaughter who wants to be a vet, trying to talk her into coming up  here. She lives in Georgia now. So we   re hoping to get that part of our  family interested in coming up here to the school. But I just appreciate  the university and the experience and the current administration, which I  think are really doing a good job. And I think you all are doing a good  job by doing this. Maybe you   ll share some things with the rest of the  world and students coming in that will learn some things about what it  used to be like here and what it is now.  It   s important to preserve these traditions.  It really is. Yes, yes, I think so. I think you all are doing a good job by  doing that.  Well thank you. Thank you for participating in the interview today. We  appreciate it.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
