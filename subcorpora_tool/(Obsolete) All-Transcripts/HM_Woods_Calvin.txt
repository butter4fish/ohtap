Speaker 1: And your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I did not know my mother's mother but I did know the lady who reared her, her stepmother.  And her name as far as I knew--she was deceased when I was a little--little boy.  And she said her name was Ms. Lotsey.  And in later years grandpa [Callie Denson Wallace] married to Ms. Viola.  I knew her when I was a boy.  That's her name, was Mrs. V-I-O-L-A.
Speaker 1: And--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Wallace.
Speaker 1: --do you know how to spell Lotsey?
Speaker 2: Yeah, L-O-T-S-E-Y
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have any knowledge of your great-grandparents?  Even if--even if it's just their names.

Speaker 1: So let's--we're--
Speaker 2: I--I did--I didn't--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --we're gonna--we're gonna go to your father's side.
Speaker 2: I didn't--
Speaker 1: But on your mother's side, do you have any knowledge of her--her grandparents?
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) No, no, I do not.
Story_ID: 106447
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's talk about Reverend Callie Denson Wallace.  You know him well?
Speaker 2: I knew grandpa well (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell me about him.
Speaker 2: He was a no sense, no nonsense man.  We--we loved him but we were afraid of him.  And he was a minister.  And his words were few but when he spoke, he meant what he said.  He was a carpenter.  He was a very good carpenter.  Built houses, churches.  So that's what I knew about him.  And he was a fearless man who taught us not to fear anybody.  Said, "Be a man.  Be a woman."  And I remember that about grandpa.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any personal interactions with him?  Something that just you and he shared?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I--I remember when I got married very young he said, "Boy you don't need that gal.  You don't need to marry."  (Laughter) I was afraid of him but I --but he was very good.  He was a God-fearing--God-fearing man.  So that's what I remember about him.  He always told you what's right.  And if he caught you doing something wrong, you were in trouble.  He could just give you a look.
Speaker 1: Where did they--did they also live in Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  During my lifetime, they lived in Birmingham [Alabama].  But I understand that grandpa [Callie Denson Wallace] lived in Talladega [Alabama], I guess, during his early life.
Speaker 1: Is that where he was born, you believe?
Speaker 2: I--I believe that could be where he was born.  And some of the other family people were there.
Speaker 1: And then they moved to Birmingham?
Speaker 2: I assume so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That--that's where you know him from is living in Birmingham (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: In--in Birmingham.
Speaker 1: Where did they live?  Did they live on a farm or did they live in the city limits?
Speaker 2: I understand that when they were young, they lived out in a place called East Lake [Alabama].  And in later years, they moved to East Thomas [Alabama].
Speaker 1: And do you remember visiting them at either one of the--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --places they lived?
Speaker 2: --in East Thomas [Alabama].  And then later on he moved to the north, over in Collegeville [Alabama].
Speaker 1: In your young days, in East Thomas, what was it like going to visit your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just fine.  We knew that--I knew that I'd probably get some bread pudding (laughter) when they cooked.  Believed in cooking a lot.  And I enjoyed it, but you had to really eat everything they put there (laughter).  You couldn't leave anything.
Speaker 1: Did they own the property in which they lived on?
Speaker 2: Well, grandfather, didn't own it.  I know a lady named Ms. Mary Cox [ph.] for a while they lived in her house, lived there with her.  And, of course, the--the second wife [Viola Wallace] that eventually married--I believe she did own that house they lived in.  I was rather young but I believe she did own that house.
Speaker 1: Do you know how much education your grandfather had?
Speaker 2: No I don't know how much education he had but he was a very studious man.  I do believe--I do believe he could have had an elementary education.  But he was very studious.  He was a great carpenter.  He--he read well.  So, he could have gone to high school.  He--he was very smart.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you remember or would like to talk about--about either one of his--his wives?
Speaker 2: Well, I only knew Ms. Viola [Viola Wallace].  She was a religious--a religious woman.  And I remember when he was ill, she was very faithful with him.
Story_ID: 106448
Speaker 1: Was there any talk about slavery on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't hear any talk about slavery but I do recall hearing,--you said on my mother's side but my mother sister, I heard her talking about some things that--how that white man used to come there and--and just stay long as he wanted to at the house.  And the name, my grandfather's [Callie Denson Wallace] name, it's, it really came from a white family, one that's very well known (laughter).
Speaker 1: You--you're speaking about the Wallace family?
Speaker 2: The Wallace family.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Maggie Rosalee Woods] share any stories about her growing up in Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Well, from what we gathered, mother was a very sweet girl.  Very nice, very nice, homely type girl who liked music.  She played the piano and she could sing.  And that's--that's basically what it was.  She was very sweet.  One of the sweetest woman I've ever known, my mother--mother was.  Believed in--she taught us what was right and she was very smart.  And one of the prettiest handwritings that--that I'd ever seen.  In later years my--one of my brother's and I we--we seem to inherited her handwriting.  I can't write that good now but it looks so much like hers.  Mother was very smart.  She helped us with our lesson.
Speaker 1: How much education did she have?
Speaker 2: I think she went too probably about the eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: Did she work outside of the home?
Speaker 2: Occasionally she--she took in washing and ironing.  And occasionally she did go to some homes and do homework, on a limited basis.
Story_ID: 106449
Speaker 1: I--I wanna step back to the--to where you were talking about the Wallace family 'cause I wanna make this clear.  On your mother's [Maggie Rosalee Woods] side, her father was Callie Denton [sic, Denson] Wallace.  And so are we saying that the Wallace family came in with Reverend Callie's mother?
Speaker 2: I--I really don't--I really don't know.  But I--I do know that I--I assumed that grandpa told them.  And I have another aunt, named Aunt Lottie [ph.] she--she's a--she's a hundred years old now.  She knew about it and she talked about how that the--the Wallace people there's some connection went back there some kind of way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your father's--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Grandfather's--
Speaker 1: --sisters.
Speaker 2: My--yeah, my mother's--
Speaker 1: Grandfather's.
Speaker 2: My mother's--my mother's sister.
Speaker 1: Your mother's sister?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where Wallace came in; he was in the family.
Story_ID: 106450
Speaker 1: What was your relationship, your personal relationship like, with your mother [Maggie Rosalee Woods]?
Speaker 2: It was very unique.  She was a person who wanted you to be frank with her.  She was very understanding.  She was concerned about us getting our lesson and acting right.  So she contributed a lot to the intellectual side of her children.  She believed in trying to keep us clean and wanted us to look our best at all times.
Speaker 1: Was she a very religious person?
Speaker 2: Mother was very religious, very sweet.  A period of time she played--she was the musician for the church.
Speaker 1: And--and what church did they attend, your family?
Speaker 2: When we were very small, the name of the church was New--New Hope Baptist Church in East Thomas [Alabama].  And I remember in later years the name of the church was changed to First Baptist [First Baptist Church, now First Missionary Baptist Church, East Thomas, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Did your grandfather preach at either one of these churches or both of them?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My grandfather pastored a church in Pinson [Alabama].  I had an occasion to attend it as a young boy with him.
Story_ID: 106451
Speaker 1: Now your father [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.], tell me your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Reverend Abraham, A-B-R-A-H-A-M, Lincoln, L-I-N-C-O-L-N, Woods, W-O-O-D-S, senior.
Speaker 1: And was his middle name always Lincoln?
Speaker 2: As far as I know.  That's--his name's always been Min A. L. Woods, Sr. that's all I knew (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now what about his parents?  Tell me your grandfather's name on your father's side?
Speaker 2: I really don't know too well.  Daddy said that all he knew was Grandpa Tucker [ph.].  He may have told some of the older ones his father's name but he didn't know anything but Grandpa Tucker.  He said Grandpa Tucker.
Speaker 1: And what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: --(unclear).  And his [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.] mother's name was Minister Prophetess Rebenia, R-E-B-E-N-I-A, F-R-A-Z-I-E-R. But she was married about three times.  She was a White before she got to be a Frazier, and I don't know what the other one was.
Speaker 1: And then she became a Woods?
Speaker 2: No, my grandmother never was a Woods.  My father's mother never was a Woods.
Speaker 1: Did you know your Grandfather Tucker?
Speaker 2: No, I never knew him.  My father said he was a white man.
Story_ID: 106452
Speaker 1: And you never had any dealings with the grandmother [Rebenia Frazier]?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, I lived with my grandmother for a considerable period of time.  She taught me how to tie my shoe and all of that.  She and I were--very close.  And some of my attributes now, they are reflecting--reflection of her.  I--I realized that when I got older.
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of them and some of the times that you spent with her.
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother was a prophetess and whatever she said, it happened.  People would send for her.  And she was also a faith healer.  And she preached and she would do it in the house and in the community as well as at church.  And we loved mama, but we really feared her.  Sometimes something would come over her and she was doing something called speaking in tongues.  We didn't know anything about that.  We didn't know what it was.  We'd get quiet, and--and it was just something about her.  She said the Lord showed her something and the Lord said something to her and it just happened, whatever--what mama said.  We called her mama.  It--it happened.  She taught me to tie my shoe and she talked about the Lord so much and I--I think a lot of that rubbed off on me because she picked me up most nights.  And she lived a few blocks from where my father [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.] lived and would carry me to stay with her, spend--spend the night from a little boy on.  She said she saw something in me (laughter) and would carry me like that.  And of course whenever it would be thundering and lightening we'd get close to her.  And if she wasn't there we--we--we wished she was there.  The way she--she just talked about the Lord so much we felt that we was safe with mama.  And she was an A-one cook.  Mama would get up some time in the wee hours of the night or before day in the morning and cook.  And we were proud of that (laughter).  We--we--and at that time she had to make a fire in the coal stove, and would do that.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your favorite foods that she would prepare for you?
Speaker 2: Chicken.  Mama could cook chicken so good and she could also cook something called cush.  Mixing bread, old bread, onions, black pepper, and salt, and meat, just a variety of things.  Just mix it up and--and put it in the skillet and cook it.  Whatever Mama cooked we--we just loved it.  She say, "I'm gone--I'm gone cook this down to a low gravy."  She talked like that (laughter).  When she did, it was good.
Speaker 1: And you said she just lived a few blocks from--
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: --where you and your family lived?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Did she--do you know how much education she might have had?
Speaker 2: No.  I--I doubt if mama had over a fifth grade education, if that much. But she was a wise woman.  She could read the Bible, and she read it faithfully.
Story_ID: 106453
Speaker 1: So, her [Rebenia Frazier] work outside the home basically was her ministry?
Speaker 2: Was her ministry.  People would send for her.  And she was specialist as it relates to curing what people called during that day piles.
Speaker 1: Tell me what that is?
Speaker 2: Well that's some type disease of the rectum or something like that.  There's another name for it, if I could think--hemorrhoids.  And those are things she could do.  She made medicine and things like that.  She laid on hands in healing.  She also made medicine, a salve for people to use.  And she also used different berries and different herbs to--to deal with fever and to--to heal people.  God gave her a gift.
Speaker 1: And you said you--you feel that you received some of her attributes.  What would they be?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't understand about God talking to people, so I've had some of those experiences too (laughter).  And took on some of the attributes of--with her of--they've accused me of being the sanctified one in the family (laughter).  She was sanctified (laughter).  So I'm just, you know, who I am, no better than anybody else but some of those things that Mama did, unknowingly to me, I started doing them too.
Speaker 1: Was speaking in tongues a part of the Baptist church?
Speaker 2: No it was not at that time.  We--it was something foreign.  We didn't know what--you know, it was--it was just something.  And--and when she'd start some time, if--if somebody tell the children she--she doing it, the children be all around the door just running up (laughter) listening and all like that.  And we--we're afraid to do anything because she was so accurate in her prophecies and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: So she belonged--did she belong to a church per se?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She belonged to the AOH Church of God [Apostolic Overcoming Holy Church of God, Birmingham, Alabama].  They called her Mother Frazier.
Story_ID: 106454
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Maggie Rosalee Woods] and father [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: Well I heard them say that mother was the--the--one of the best girls who lived in East Thomas [Alabama].  And one day my father saw her and started talking to her and the relationship continued to grow.  And my understanding is that my people on my mother's side didn't want her to marry daddy (laughter) but they married anyhow at a young age.  So that's what that--that's what-- that's what happened.  She loved him.  Daddy had--she talked about all of that straight, curly hair he had and all of that.  And he was nice looking and--and he dressed very immaculate.  And she was just swept off her feet when they were young.
Speaker 1: How--how old--old were they when they married?
Speaker 2: Mother was fourteen.
Speaker 1: And your father was just a little bit older?
Speaker 2: Just a little bit older but not too much.  Probably a couple of years older.
Speaker 1: And they settled in--in Birmingham [Alabama] in--
Speaker 2: In East Thomas [Alabama].
Speaker 1: --In East Thomas.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My--my-- my father's mother [Rebenia Frazier] came from Prattville, Alabama.  And that--that's where they--they came from.  And--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Say the name of the city again?
Speaker 2: P-R-A-T-T-V-I-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: Prat--
Speaker 2: A-L-A-B-A-M-A.  And his mother came to Birmingham [Alabama].  And after she had been here for a while, I think some kind of way he slipped off and found her.  He came as a young boy, he got here to Birmingham where his mother is.  Because he has--had several other sisters and brothers.  But he--he came to Birmingham as a young boy.
Story_ID: 106455
Speaker 1: Now what did your father [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.] do?
Speaker 2: My father worked at M-C-W-A-N-E, McWane, P-I-P-E, Shop, S-H-O-P, McWane Pipe Shop.  He started working there as a--a young boy, and he worked there until he retired.  Of course, as time went on, God called him to preach.  He was working at that pipe shop, when God spoke to him.  Said something struck him in the middle of his head and knocked him to the ground.  He was rolling a wheelbarrow.  And the Lord told him to preach the Gospel.  And he said that he had been disobedient because the Lord had previously told him to preach and he didn't want to do it.  So God arrested him and he started from there.  Became a great dynamic, man of God.
Story_ID: 106456
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just want to go back and--and clarify some things as far as your father's [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.] parents.  Your grand--the Grandfather Tucker [ph.], or who your father called his father, Tucker, was not married to your grandmother, Rebenia [Frazier].  And you told me her, her maiden name was what again?
Speaker 2: Arbee.
Speaker 1: Spell that for me.
Speaker 2: A-R-B-E-E.
Speaker 1: And then she married to a White and a Frazier?
Speaker 2: I--I didn't know neither one of 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was a little boy, they were gone.  I never saw either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Neither one.
Speaker 1: So Grandfather Tucker is who reared your father [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.] but he did not have a relationship with Rebenia [Frazier](unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Unclear) he said that wasn't his birth father.
Speaker 1: But he didn't know who his birth father was?
Speaker 2: His--he never told us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He said that's the only one he knew.
Story_ID: 106457
Speaker 1: So now when they marry, they live in East Thompson-Thomas [East Thomas, Alabama], and when do they come to Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Your mother [Maggie Rosalee Woods] and father [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Well, they--I don't know when they came but they were in Birmingham [Alabama] when they married.  That's where they were.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: In a place called East Thomas [Alabama].
Speaker 1: I see.  So East Thomas is in Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 106458
Speaker 1: When you think about where you lived at that time, what sounds, sights, and smells take you back to that time?
Speaker 2: Well, the place is so different now.  I used to smell the creek.  We used to go and slip and swim in the creek or mud crawl, call ourselves swimming in the creek.  And we used to have a garden.  We used to have--raise hogs and chickens.  They don't allow that now.  So it's--it's kind of hard-pressed when I go through the community now, it looks so much different.  It's just--just a change.  And I doubt if I can find any of the older heads who was there, they're gone, all of 'em.  So it's--it's much different now in this small place.
Speaker 1: But when you think about at that time--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Other than the church.  The church is still out there, First Baptist Church [First Missionary Baptist Church, East Thomas, Alabama].  The churches are still there and--and that's a good thing.
Speaker 1: Now tell me what you--you smell you can remember the smell of the creek.  What's sounds do you--do you remember?
Speaker 2: I remember the chirping of the birds and you can't hear that as much as you used to hear.  The barking of the dogs running rampant through the community.  And the--the--the smell of the hog pens are gone.  But--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: --it's--it's a sacred place to me, where we were brought up.  The streets are not dirt streets now.
Speaker 1: So that was a sight that you remember--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --dirt roads.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The main street that goes through it was--I remember it was dirt because I remember when they tarred it.
Story_ID: 106459
Speaker 1: Tell me about your siblings.  Tell me their--just give me their names, but give me the progression and where you fit in.
Speaker 2: All right.  My mother [Maggie Rosalee Woods] and father [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.] actually had thirteen children.  Two died at birth because born too quickly, the twins.  My oldest brother, is Reverend Abraham Woods, Jr.  And my--the second child is minister, she's a minister now, Mary Ruby Hutchinson (ph.).  And my third sibling was Melzar--Melzar Luke, Melzar.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: M-E-L-Z-A-R, Melzar.  Named after my mother's brother (laughter).  And she was the third child.  She's deceased.  And I am the fourth child.  I am the fourth child.  After me, there was a boy, Roy.  Dr. R-O-Y Woods.  He's a medical doctor.  And after Roy, came Shirley, S-H-I-R-L-E-Y.  After Shirley came--Shirley is--is a minister also.  She's a minister.  But after Shirley came pastor, another sister who is a pastor, Lottie, Lottie Mae, L-O-T-T-I-E, M-A-E, Lottie Mae.  And after Lottie Mae came Franklin, F-R-A-N-K-L-I-N.  After Franklin, came Dwight, D-W-I-G-H-T.  And after Dwight came the baby, Cathy, C-A-T-H-Y, who is also a minister.
Speaker 1: I notice that all of the boys except Roy has the name of a president.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's Franklin Delano [ph.]; Dwight, Dwight Edward Eisenhower (ph.), Dwight, that's correct.  All of them but Roy.
Speaker 1: And how did Roy wind up with a name that wasn't the name of a president?
Speaker 2: Well, I named Roy because I said I was Roy Rogers, the cowboy.  And I asked my mother would she name him Roy, name him Roy and they laughed.  Mother named him Roy (laughter).  I loved Roy Rogers.  I used to ride a stick and pretend like I was riding a horse.  I was Roy Rogers.  So mother named him--named him what the baby said (laughter).  See Roy came after me (laughter).
Story_ID: 106460
Speaker 1: Now with your siblings, even as you--you're growing up, you're the fourth of these thirteen children?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And you are born, and most of your siblings are born during the Depression.  Did your family or did you even know that there was a depression going on?
Speaker 2: I do remember where we went, I believe, with I don't know who's--who we went with, but we used to on occasion go stand in line to get food items.  And I think that was long before we--we really had to stand in line to get that, get cheese, the government used to give cheese and butter, and peanut butter.  But I remember the occasions we went to Legion Field [Birmingham, Alabama] before the system got--was organized as it became.  And the people would be standing in line waiting to get groceries.  And I do remember that.  My father [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.] worked very hard at McWane [McWane Pipe Shop, Birmingham, Alabama].  He also had a job--also raised hogs.  And we had to hustle slop and go and gather up slop and food for the hogs.  So we were always fed.  But I can't just say how rough it was, because my parents were, you know, actually responsible for getting it.  But we worked.  We had to go and pick up coal off the railroad track sometimes in order to have coal to burn.  We had to go to the woods--into the woods and cut down little trees.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Cut them with the ax and do things to help out.  We had to do that.  So it was a cooperative effort in the family.  All of us had to do something.  No more than wash the dishes, sweep the yard.  We didn't have any grass in the yard.  We had to sweep the yard.  And do all of that.  All of us had chores.
Speaker 1: When you say go to the railroad tracks to get coal, tell me why you would go to the railroad tracks to get coal.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Why would coal be there on the railroad tracks?
Speaker 2: It would be there because during that time you--the trains passed by and the trains would be, many of them, the box cars would be loaded with coal.  And the train would be going so fast, usually some coal would fall off and we'd walk the track finding it, that which had fallen off the train.  Sometimes we'd do very well.  A lot of people were doing that.
Story_ID: 106461
Speaker 1: Tell me about elementary school.  Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I attended East Thomas Elementary School.  It was a four room building.  All of the classes were housed in those four rooms, including the principal.  The principal taught the first and second grade.  So that's where I went until I got into the--the--the seventh grade.  And from there I went to Tuggle Elementary School [Birmingham, Alabama] which was about a mile and a half from where I lived.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the teachers in elementary school.  Was there one teacher that you remember that might have encouraged you as a child?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who were your teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My very--very first teacher was Ms. Lollie E. Guise [ph.], our principal.  She was a very, very caring woman who--who was the foundation.  When you got out of Ms. Guise's room, you really knew a lot.  She was concerned--I remember one morning I--I wore a pajama shirt to school that some white people had given to my mother who she washed and ironed for.  And I thought it looked good.  It just looked good to me.  I didn't have any pajamas.  So I wore it and I thought I was looking good and Ms. Guise called me up to her desk and said, "Calvin, don't wear that tomorrow.  A shirt look--would look better."  I still didn't understand what she was--I thought that the shirt, you know.  So she was very good.  She helped us and we learned a lot.  My second teacher, was Ms. Betty Gordon (ph.).  And Ms. Gordon (ph.) taught us certainly a great deal.  And she was an Indian, at least that's what the people said.  She started the school.  The school started in her house, Ms. Betty Gordon (ph.).  And she was a very good, religious woman.  And my next teacher was--she taught the--the third and the fourth grade.  And my next teacher was Ms. L, L-E-L-A, B-U-T-L-E-R, Ms. Lela Butler (laughter) taught.  And she taught the fifth and sixth grade.  And Ms. Butler was a--a woman about community.  She was very articulate and dressed well and during that time Ms. Butler had a car.  And that was just noteworthy.  So many--many people did not have a car.  And Ms. Butler had a strap and you didn't wanna be whipped by that strap and I've gotten some licks.  If she catch you talking or something like that and tell you to stop.  And they--they could whip us during those days.  And my next teacher was Ms. Helen Bright [ph.].  She later married and became Ms. Helen Mc--McDaniel [ph.].  That's where the Lord called me to preach in her class, in the broad open daytime.  She was a young teacher.  I didn't know what was happening and she didn't neither.  But I know what I saw and know what the Lord told me.  She thought I was going crazy.
Story_ID: 106462
Speaker 1: Tell me what happened.
Speaker 2: Well, I was sitting in the classroom, at what we call the library table.  It was just a little table in the room, in the corner of the room.  And we had different books.  And she would send some children to sit at the library table.  If you finish your lesson wanted to go--you could go to the library.  And I was a rather smart boy and I could go to the library most--table most any time.  And I was sitting there one day and I had this vision, something happened.  I didn't know what was going on.  I heard some singing and I was looking around and look like heavens opened up.  And I saw this long, white pulpit it was like a desk stretched across the bosom of the sky.  And Jesus was sitting at that pulpit and people were sitting around him and he was calling me to come up.  And I was--was kind of where--where I was but I--I couldn't--couldn't get up, you know, to go.  And he stretched out a Bible to me and told me to preach.  And so--but before this happened I missed some of it.  I heard somebody--I heard the singing and heard somebody calling me.  I didn't see anybody and went up to her desk and asked the teacher did she call me.  She said, "No."  She didn't think that.  I set back down and it was still going on.  And I started crying.  I went up there to her and asked her did she call me.  And she said, "Calvin, you must be losing your mind.  You're going crazy or something like that."  So when I set back down and cried and it really opened up and I saw all of this happen.  So it was--I was a little boy.  And when school was out, I ran down the hill, my daddy [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.] hadn't gotten home from work.  And when he came, I told him what had happened and he said, "Boy, you've been called to preach."  So that's what I remember about school.  But I didn't preach then, I was a little boy.
Speaker 1: What grade were you in when this happened?
Speaker 2: I think I was in the seventh grade.  In the seventh grade when that happened.  And I got skipped a lot.  I was in high school when I was twelve.
Speaker 1: So you were an excellent student?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 106463
Speaker 1: A good student.  What type of child were you?
Speaker 2: Well, I talked a lot.  I thought I knew everything and said I talked a lot (laughter).  I talked a lot.  And children used to med--I don't have it now, I had curly hair.  They use to call me Curly and--all I was very small.  And I was mischievous just like the rest of 'em but people said I was a good boy.  But I did the same things the rest of the children did but I--I had to do mine in such a way because I knew when my parents found out that we were doing something wrong, that--that we'd get a whipping.  But I--I did just what the other children did as a bad boy.  But I was very respectful.  They said that I was very mannerable.  I spoke to people.  I tried to be helpful.  If I'd see an elderly person carrying a package or crossing the street or--I wanted to be helpful from a little boy.
Speaker 1: And because people said that you were a good child and you wanted to be helpful, tell me about the people in the neighborhood or in--in which you lived.  Take me on a tour, say of square block of--of where you lived and who lived there and were the--the other families did they have a lot of children also?  What type of professions were--lived in the area?
Speaker 2: My parents had, I believe, I don't--I can't recall another family that had any more children than we had.  But when I was a boy, if anyone in the community caught you being out of line, they could really chastise you and some of 'em would even venture to whip you.  And if they told your parent, you'd really get a whipping.  And if we'd be doing something, we'd beg and, "Please don't--please don't tell ma.  Please don't--don't tell daddy.  Please, please."  Because you could be chastised by anybody.  And the minister in the community, if we would be shooting marbles or anything, we'd see him coming, we'd jack 'em up and go to running.  So you just respected people like that in community.  If you were a child, any adult could chastise you during that time-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other people and where did you shop in your community?  Who owned the--the businesses in the community?
Speaker 2: All right.  When I was boy, I used to shop a lot at a place called Zeke's [ph.], Zeke's Store.  If I'd get a penny or a nickel or something we could by a slice of baloney for a penny.  You could get two oatmeal cookies for a penny.  This was a black man, lived right next door to--to the church.  He had a little hole in the wall place right there at his house.  And a block from there, there was a store, it was a little larger than Zeke's called Stevenson's [ph.] Grocery.  This was Ms. Stevenson.  She was a black lady.  And you could go to her and buy more items than you could at Zeke but the people said she was so high but (laughter) but they had to go to Ms. Stevenson and she stayed at it until--she eventually built a brick building.  But the main store in--in the community down in the bottom was Carmichael [ph.], Carmichael's Grocery Store.  And that is where, you know, most of the people went to--to buy their groceries.  He had a boy working, him deliver groceries on the--on the bicycle.  And that's where the white people in the area and many blacks went.  And later on, another grocery store opened closer to our house in the building where New Hope Baptist Church [East Thomas, Alabama] used to be.  Some people came and took it over by the name of Gusiminor [ph.].  And they opened up a grocery store.  And we were glad it was real close to us.  So that's where we did our shopping in the community--in the community stores.  And you could--you wanted to buy a nickel's worth of sugar or you--you could buy some meal or some flour.  Tell him how much white meat you want.  You bought a quarter's worth of liver or whatever.  The--the health standards weren't as strenuous as they later became.  So I experienced all of that.

Speaker 1: Were there any extracurricular activities that you belonged to?  Did you play sports or music?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We played sandlot baseball, football.  I was very fast.  I was on the track team.  I ran.  Could run fast.  And but I never played on the football team when I got to high school.  I was so small, I was very small.  But I--I ran a lot.  And we would often play baseball, what we call down in the park, it was really down in the woods.  We had a big 'ol field.  But in these times in which we live now, they've taken that place and made a real park out it now.  They have a swimming pool and all of that, I'm so proud of that, where we used to play as children.
Speaker 1: Did you swim as a child?
Speaker 2: Well I tried to swim.  And I was getting drowned, drowned.  My parent had told us to stay out of that hole.  And the hole was called Benwood [ph.].  I told 'em yes ma'am and stay out of it.  Children would go there to swim.  It was just a big 'ol hole, like a ditch.  And I slipped.  I had done it before and this particular day I slipped and I thought I had really learned how to swim good, was probably doing nothing but mud crawling get in there where your hand touching the bottom.  So I thought I had it.  And I went way on out in the--in the--in the--in the ditch and stepped in a suck hole, a hole.  Was going down and I was drowning.  And I tried to holler and water got in my mouth.  And a boy named Theodore Jordan [ph.] said, "Calvin ain't playing."  And he dashed out there and saved me.  That boy saved my life, Theodore Jordan.  I'll never forget his name.  And you can believe me, I never got in Benwood any more.  They saved me.  They really did.  So we also called ourselves swimming in Village Creek [Birmingham, Alabama] when raw sewage would be coming down, we'd push it out of the way.  And we didn't have no swimming pool or nothing like that (laughter).  We--we'd get in the creek.  We did it, southern children.  We did it wanting--wanting somewhere to play and something to do.

Speaker 1: Now in the seventh grade, you go Tuggle [Elementary School in Birmingham, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I--
Speaker 1: High school?
Speaker 2: I left the seventh grade and went to Tuggle, Tuggle Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Elementary.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how long do you stay there?
Speaker 2: Just one year.
Speaker 1: Now what year did you--you started school when you were six?
Speaker 2: Six years old.
Speaker 1: So that would have been in 1939?
Speaker 2: I don't know really--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: You were born--you were in 19--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --but I started when I was six.
Speaker 1: Six, right.  So that's 1939.  And the seventh grade elementary school at East Thomas [Elementary School] and then one year at total--Tuggle [Elementary School].
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And high school.  Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: At Parker High School [Birmingham, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Now tell me about Parker High School [Birmingham, Alabama].   What is the legacy behind Parker High School?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a great thing to go to Parker.  When I started to Parker they had what they call Parker Annex.  It was some little--little houses, little buildings about two blocks down the street from the main building.  Everyone in the ninth grade had to go to the [Parker] Annex.  So I went to the [Parker] Annex.  Very proud because we had to have uniforms.  I had to wear khaki pants.  And the girls had to wear blue dresses.  And it--it was outstanding and I enjoyed that.  And I was so happy when I finished the ninth grade.  Went to the tenth, up to the main building.
Story_ID: 105422
Speaker 1: So we were talking about Parker High School [Birmingham, Alabama].  So you were really glad to go to the tenth grade so that you could go to the main building.
Speaker 2: To the main building.
Speaker 1: So tell me, how that (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, it was,--it--it was very exciting.  They called me Little Bit [ph.].  And they were just appalled and I was looking so small they said to be in--be in high school.  And the--the teachers--I was just--weren't--weren't too intimidated but I had respect for teachers.  During that time, you really did respect--respect teachers.  All the teachers worked.  And they dressed outstanding, very neat.  Encouraged the students to be neat; to brush your teeth, comb your hair, and put on deodorant.  They were very frank about that.  They would inspect the way we were dressed 'cause we had to have on uniforms and they talked to us about--about our character.  I remember what the slogan was: "Character Development Through Self-Improvement."  And even when we got to high school and we would have devotion in home room.  We had to say Bible verses and things like that.  And the teacher could offer prayer if she wanted to.  And basically they would lead us in--in the "Lord's Prayer" and we'd have to recite the pledge, the pledge of allegiance to the flag.  We sang patriotic songs.  We had to do that.  So I--I missed that in the latter years.  We did that.  And one thing about those teachers, they didn't just rest with the books.  We had to go to the library, they got supplemental materials.  And they were really concerned about our being educated.
Speaker 1: Now, when you say library, the library in the school?  Was there a public library that you were able to utilize at this time?
Speaker 2: There--there was--was a library in the school, but there was only--during that time there was only one library that I was aware of and that was the library downtown where the whites went basically.  And some of us couldn't always readily get there.  It was a job to be able to get downtown.  But the teachers really--they really strove hard to educate us.  We had to keep up with what's going on in the world through newspaper.  We had to bring current events.  We had to talk about current events.  They went all out to educate us.  They really did.  I can see that now.  They did an outstanding job.  We had in addition to classes, we had many extracurricular activities that also helped to--to mold us.
Story_ID: 105423
Speaker 1: What were some of the extracurricular activities that you belonged to?
Speaker 2: Well, we had--they had scouting.  They had high wire, something like the Y for the children.  (Unclear) there had the current events club.  Had the history club.  Things of this--of this nature.  And, of course, and Parker's [Parker High School] always been noted for good singing.  Had one of the greatest choirs.
Speaker 1: And what did you belong to?
Speaker 2: I belonged to choir.  I belonged to the current events club, to the history club.  Anything that that run my mouth and after study (laughter).  I belonged to that.  And--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Did you say--did you say the debate club?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  And also the--the acting club.  I can't think of what it--what it--the name.
Speaker 1: Drama?
Speaker 2: Drama.  Drama.  So--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: --not all at once but these some things I participated in during my studies in--in the--in high school.
Speaker 1: So you were 12 when you went into ninth grade?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: Was there a teacher that you can remember that really looked out for you being that you said you were small in stature and you were very young to be in high school?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Was there a teacher that you remember that--that sticks out in your mind?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Desi Harris Ray [ph.].  And Ms. Leona T. Reed [ph.].  Ms. Leona T. Reed was more like a mother to me.  And Ms. Desi Harris Ray helped to pull out a lot in me.  Ms. Ray saw it, Ms. Reed helped to develop it.  And I was able to win a scholarship to college, partial scholarship to college.  She said I was an orator and she was gone pull it out.  And I won the "Birmingham News" Age Herald, H.A. Herald oratorical contest.  It was something during that time, a hundred dollars and a partial scholarship to Miles College.  And the next year I won the--the Elks contest at our school but they didn't let me speak because I had just won the contest the year before and they let a girl named Halter McAlphin [ph.] speak.  And so Ms. Leona T. Reed and Ms. Desi Harris Ray and they really did work with me.  And another man who I really remember--really seemed to thought a lot of me, his name was Mr. P. B. Watley [ph.], shoe repairing.  I took up shoe repairing too.  And he was very interested in me just like a father.
Speaker 1: Shoe repair was offered in high school?
Speaker 2: Shoe repairing was offered.  Also--I also took up tailoring and made a pair of pants under Mr. Simmons, S-I-M-M-O-N-S, Mr. Simmons.  It was a--a requirement if you went to--to tailoring you had to learn how to make something.  Had to do that.  Cosmetology was offered in school.  Auto mechanics was offered also in school.  Home economics called cooking was offered--offered during those times.  And, of course, it's a part of business education, typing.  Many things were offered during that--that time.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: In school.
Story_ID: 105424
Speaker 1: What is--what do you think about when you go--think about your time at Parker [High School in Birmingham, Alabama]?  What one event sticks out in your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was running for president of the--the student council.  I remember one boy lambasted me for my straight hair.  I don't have it now, used to have curly hair.  And he just took that and--and that but was all right.  I--I became the vice president of the student council.  Was the president of my senior--in my particular senior class.  And as a fella that--that--that kind of bothered me, a little bit.  It was just me and I didn't see (laughter) what he saw, you know, in that.  But there are so many good things that--that really wasn't bad.  So many good things happened.  We had so many good teachers.  They were really concerned about the children and--and helped them.  And I think one of the most important things that--when I won the oratory contest competing with all of the high schools in the city.
Speaker 1: Now you--did you say you ran track for Parker [High School]?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't run track for Parker [High School].  No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: So, how old are you when you graduate?
Speaker 2: I had just became, I believe, I just became--I became, I was 17, I believe, 16 or 17.  I graduated in January 1950.  I believe I was in--turning 17 in September, I believe.
Speaker 1: Was there a prom?
Speaker 2: Yes I went (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell me about the prom.
Speaker 2: I carried a young lady to the prom whose name was Annie Phillips [ph.] and I got someone to carry me over to her [Annie Phillips] house.  I can't recall who drove the car.  And picked her up and we went to a place called the Elks.  It was a little down on Eighth Avenue now but ma'am, just a little place.  We--we couldn't go to these big places they go to now.  And the space was limited.  And I was trying to dance, she said, "Calvin, now you've got to do better than this."  I was stepping all over her feet (laughter).  I didn't know.  I was trying.  I recall that.  It--it was quite enjoyable.  But I was ready to get away from there (laughter).  I was ready to go home but--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: --I went.  It was enjoyable.
Story_ID: 105425
Speaker 1: Well, tell me some of the other things that teenagers would do during that time.  What music was out?  What music did you enjoy?
Speaker 2: Well I learn--learned how to jitterbug.  And the jitterbug I liked to do that.  We was clowning, you know, and carrying on.  So jitterbugging was out.  And during that time, it was a thing called the hula hoop.  Put a round, you know, circle thing around you and do--do the hula hoop.  And they used to do something called the truck.  I don't know whether I could do that to well, you were trucking.  And, of course, I had grown up, young man when they came out with something called the electric slide.  I was a man then, a young man.  But that jitterbug we used to do the--do the jitter bug, that's what they call.
Speaker 1: What other past times?  Did you listen to the radio?  And then--tell me what you used to listen on the radio?  Was it a family affair?
Speaker 2: Well, we used to listen to the radio and I remember when got a radio.  We used to didn't have no radio.  We had to go somewhere else to listen to the radio.  And we'd listen to stories on the radio, you know, they happened to be acting them out.  And we used to--didn't wanna miss "The Lone Ranger", it'd come on.  And then--and Gene Autry would come on and sing.  We--we liked to hear the cowboys and--and other series that came on.  On Sunday morning we would listen to our religious music because it wasn't coming on during the week like it does now.  And a matter of fact, I recall we didn't even have any--any black religious stations to listen to them.  I remember the first one look like I remember was a group called Wings Over Jordan [Wings Over Jordan Choir].  And they sang, you know, the spiritual songs and the kind of song like sing in college too.  But as time moved on it--it really did open up.  And I used to like to hear a man named Johnny Mercer sing.  And I don't know that--that wasn't religious.  But I think he--a song I loved, I believe, he sang you got to "Accentuate the Positive, Eliminate the Negative." ["Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive"]  And I used to just wait for that song.  I--I loved that song.  And when I was a little boy, another song I--I really did love, it wasn't just a religious song, but "At Last My Love Has Come Along" ["At Last," Etta James].  I used to just love to hear such as that (laughter), like that so.  We just--I guess we just loved what the average young people did love.
Speaker 1: What-- well, yeah.  What did the church--how did the--the church play out as far as what you were allowed to do and not allowed to do?  Or was there any rules about that in your home?
Speaker 2: Yes, there were some rules.  We used to sell rags and scrap iron, pick up tin cans and make a little money.  The iron man used to come around.  The rag man and the tin can man and it we could make enough--pick up enough to make a nickel or a dime.  And he had what was called a little ticket.  You could put the ticket with it and you could go to the picture show.  And the rule at our house was, if you don't get up in time and get yourself ready for Sunday school and church, you can't go to church--show next week.  You can't go to no show.  So that was a rule.  If we didn't go to church you can just forget about going to--to the picture show.  And we had to walk all the way to the picture show downtown.  We didn't have no--no carfare to ride or anything like that.  So church was very serious in our house.  We had--we had--we had to go.  And we had to participate in the church.
Story_ID: 105426
Speaker 1: When was your first experience with racism?
Speaker 2: My first overt experience with racism, when I was a young fella, I married early.  I married early, I had been to college one year.  And--and I was working as a janitor at the Phoenix Building [Birmingham, Alabama] that housed the telephone company, part of it.  And I worked at night.  I was on my way home early one morning.  I walked to the street car station and a white police man walked up to me, searched me, came out of my pocket with a big pocket knife and wanted to know what was I doing with that pocket knife but I had no knife.  He put it in my pocket.  And during that time, many blacks were being killed by the police, and there was nothing was being done about it.  I was very frightened.  He said, "What are you doing with this knife?"  And I said, "I'm gone tell you but you ain't believe me."  He said, "Try me."  I said, "I know Clarence put it in my pocket down there where I work at the Phoenix Building 'cause he the only one was in there when I was putting my--changing clothes.  Clarence did it.  I know Clarence did it."  He said, "Clarence did it."  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "You oughta watch that so and so Clarence."  (Laughter) now if I had said that he did it, I would have been in--been in trouble.  See, I didn't see him, he put his hand in his pocket, I didn't believe Clarence did it, but Clarence actually was in--in the room down there.  It was really in the toilet where we changed clothes, the toilet and the little office and things like that.  So that frightened me because the truth as I sit, I had seen the police kill a man down the street from where I caught the streetcar some time earlier.  I don't know if it was week or so.  Drove up right by a grocery store, I believe, it could have been Hill's [ph.] Grocery Store or A and P, it's been so long.  Got out of the car, and I saw the police when he got out of the car, and bam, bam, bam, bam.  He shot in the car.  And I was nearly frightened to death, and I hid.  And would later learned in the paper that a Negro was killed for attacking a police but he wasn't attacking him.  And I was already scared but I had to catch the streetcar and worked at night, before day had to come home in the morning.  And it was very overt brutality on--on blacks.  But that really did upset me that morning.  There are--there are several other things that--that transpired but that was the first time I had a personal experience with it.  And on another occasion when I didn't have the money that--to ride to my job and I happened to look and some fellows were leaning out a car and getting ready to throw something and hit me in the head and I looked just in--in time.  They were white--white men, like that.  So that's when I really experienced some personal hatred coming from other people toward me.  Because when I was a little boy, we used to play with the white boys down in the woods and all of that.  My grandmama used to--used to go to their house and sit down there and eat.  They--they--they let me sit right there at a table eat with the little white boys.  You know, when we were little like that.  I really didn't know anything about all of that when I was a little bitty boy like that.  But I thought that's just the way things supposed to be.  They would then give mama something to bring home and all like that.  So it took some time.
Story_ID: 105427
Speaker 1: Who was it that influenced you to go to college or helped you prepare to go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Maggie Rosalee Woods] would always encouraged us to--to go to college.  And, of course, the oldest brother [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Jr.] went on to college.  And those who were behind we felt that we should have done the same thing.  And the teachers were encouraging us to go forward and I had gotten to the place where I wanted to go myself.  I felt like I had to and I wanted to excel and to go forward.  And that was my every intention.  And, of course, I got married and--and I--I never was satisfied.  I'd get an opportunity to go a little while and I'd have a fall out.  And I graduated from Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] after twenty-six years.  My oldest daughter and I graduated on the same Sunday.  Eventually made it.  But I had been going to religious schools and studying at the Bible College [Birmingham Baptist Bible College?] and different things like that.  I had so much encouragement from our teachers and from my mother.  And we--we just felt like we had to--to move forward.  We had to do it.
Speaker 1: You had gotten a partial scholarship--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --from a contest in high school.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So is that how you went the first year?
Speaker 2: That's how I went the first year.
Speaker 1: And during that first year, is that when you got married?
Speaker 2: I got married.
Speaker 1: Tell me who you married.
Speaker 2: I married a young lady.  Her name was Lucille Grayson [ph.].  She was a dynamic majorette.  And I really met her and started liking her at my oldest sister's wedding.  I saw her, she had on some of the prettiest little white shoes.  And she was just sitting quiet, weren't talking to anybody.  And it was just something about her.  Love at first sight.  And several people were there, but I couldn't get my eyes off of her.  And then I--I just wanted to marry her.  Just--it was just love at first sight when I saw her and we were young.  And--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: So this is in the 1951 or '52 [1952]?
Speaker 2: In--in wait a minute, '50 [1950] it was in, I believe it was '51 [1951] or '52 [1952] (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: 'Cause you married--
Speaker 2: 'Cause we married in--oh, I'll tell you when it was.  I started to Miles [College] in March and I married on December 3, 1950 that same year.
Story_ID: 105428
Speaker 1: Had any thoughts come back to you about you beginning to preach?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They had come back to me but I didn't--I didn't preach.  There are several things that took place.  The Lord spoke to me another time during the broad open daytime.  My wife [Lucille Woods] and I, we lived in a little two room house.  Broad open daytime and I was carried off in the spirit in a church.  And people were sitting out in the congregation.  Dirt and trash all around 'em, they just sitting in the midst of the dirt and the trash.  And I've always sung basically in a quartet as a little boy.  We used to sing in the community.  We'd run from house to house singing, older folk give us a piece of cake or something like that, you know.  And then we'd learn how to sing then we start singing in church.  And I saw these people sitting out there in the filth and the quartet that our boys, who I was singing with, they were all--we used to go in the pulpit and sing when the preacher let us.  And I was looking at those people sitting out in all that filth, and I couldn't take it.  I just stopped singing and just started preaching and I remember some words I said.  I said, "People, this life will soon be over."  And the spirit was on me.  I was preaching and folk went to hollering and the dirt began to disappear.  And all I (unclear) in the broad open daytime.  And I came out of it.  I was right--living right around the corner from my parents.  And I went up there to tell 'em and I couldn't tell 'em.  I--I came back, you know.  That had happened.  And something worse than that happened.  I went on, I guess, about year or more didn't anything happen.  Until I got deathly sick.  They rushed me to the hospital and on the inside I knew what it was.  Weren't nobody saying nothing in the hospital and I was just knowing they were gone put me in the hospital.  I felt like I was dying.  And doctors said my pressure was all right.  My heartbeat was all right.  I was sick.  Sent me back home.  I was still sick and I guess a day or so, had to call doctor--what is his name?  Doctor Ballard [ph.] or something, somebody.  They got the doctor to come out there.  He couldn't find nothing.  And I was so sick, couldn't hardly lay in the bed.  Until some people named Saints came by.  They heard I was sick, lived in the community.  Lady name we called her Sister Peoples [ph.] and one name Ms. Cadelia Thomas [ph.].  They came by me, came by to see me and had prayer with me.
Story_ID: 106915
Speaker 1: So you--you were telling me about the women that came--that's one of the saints that came to pray for you.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Those saints came and prayed for me and I really felt better.  And they instructed me that God had a call on my life and they knew what the problem was.  And I promised the Lord and that if he would heal me, and that I would preach the Gospel and they rejoiced at that.  But I lied and after I got up, I--I just really wasn't ready to do it.  And I told the Lord, I said, "Lord, if you really want me to preach, I want you to just speak to me like a natural man.  I wanna just hear you naturally.  Just talk to me.  Just talk to me.  Just talk to me."  So I got away until, I believe, in '56 [1956].  One Saturday night I was watching "Ted Mack Amateur Hour" and the Lord carried me in the spirit up on a high mountain and there on the high mountain seated next to Jesus was a man named Reverend Percy Johnson [ph.].  He's a Church of Christ preacher and he'd always talked with me about the scripture and said he knew I'd been called, so all this you said the Lord then told you and done with you.  Said I just read the scriptures and knew I oughta been preaching.  And he used to encourage me to preach, but I--I didn't do it.  And he was sitting up there on the mountain with Jesus.  And Jesus handed me the Bible and I wouldn't take it.  I went to running.  And a lady dressed in white, I could see all of this--dressed in white said, "Preach we've been waiting for you a long time.  A long time."  And just multitudes of people standing and I'm just running and everywhere I ran look like people knew me they were saying that man's a preacher.  And I was trying to outrun--run the (unclear) I couldn't get away.  And I ran into the house where I was having the vision, it was in Lubman [ph.] Project.  And I ran in and told my wife [Lucille Woods].  "All them people following me.  Telling me--telling me to preach."  And they just walked right on in the door crying just preach, preach, preach.  So to make a long story short, I didn't do it.  I didn't do it then.  I made it to work, that this was on Saturday night, and this Monday and I felt myself dying on the job.  Like my head was sinking down into my--my body.  And I confessed to the Lord that I would preach and he released me, I was light as a feather.  And I ran through the building with all of those people both black and white just screaming and hollering and just preaching and just preaching.  I been preaching ever since then.  I didn't tell you all of it but that was--that was--that was some of it.
Story_ID: 106916
Speaker 1: Between 1950 and '56 [1956] when you began to preach, did you work at the Phoenix Building the entire time?
Speaker 2: I worked at the Phoenix Building [Birmingham, Alabama] until I was fired.  I was arrested for preaching.  I had been called to a church and I was instructing them to--to ride the buses and sit down wherever there is a seat.  You pay your money.  I instructed the black people, in particular the women, not to get up and give their seat to any white people and to--to just ride the bus integrated.  And there were some spies in my congregation, and they arrested me at the Phoenix Building.  I didn't know why they were arresting me (laughter).  And I was sentenced to six months at hard labor and fined $500.  They accused me of--of trying to bring about a boycott of the Birmingham buses.  And, of course, that case had to be appealed all the way to Alabama State Circuit Court of Appeals who said that they arrested me illegally and unconstitutionally.
Speaker 1: So they arrested you and you were out on--on bond?
Speaker 2: Out on bond.  And had to appeal it all the way out of the city of Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Who was your attorney?
Speaker 2: My attorney--attorney was Attorney Oscar Adams [Justice Oscar W. Adams, Jr.?]  He's a very great man.
Speaker 1: Now--and this was in 1956?
Speaker 2: No this was in, I believe, this was in 1900 and 50--
Speaker 1: In '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: '59 [1959].
Story_ID: 106917
Speaker 1: Now in--back in 1956, you and your brother founded an organization [Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights] because of this--the disbandment of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], is that right?
Speaker 2: Well, Dr. Fred Shuttlesworth [HM Fred Shuttlesworth] was really the innovator, the one who'd lay it out in founding the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights.  He actually did that.  I was not really on--in on the original development of that, Dr. Shuttlesworth was.  There was a group large--larger group there were about seven particular people who were really in on it.  And one name doesn't usually come up in that original group, his name is Reverend C. J. Evans [ph.].  I succeeded him at the church [East End Baptist Church?] where I became the pastor.  He was one of the original ministers in the--in the organization.
Speaker 1: So tell me how active you were in civil rights.  What were some of the things that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: I was very active.  I didn't expect to become as active as I did become.  After--after I was arrested and that brought a lot of attention to me and--and losing my job.  I was involved in picketing and demonstrating.  I headed up different picketing groups.  I was very heavily involved in voter registration.  Matter of fact, my group registered more people than any group we had had here in Birmingham [Alabama].  And they presented a dog to me named Freedom.  And, of course, I named one of my sons Freedom [Freedom Woods] after the struggle.  So I was involved in everything that went on in the city of--city of Birmingham.  From the time--the inception of that--that organization [Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights] up until now, I'm still involved in it.
Speaker 1: Tell me the relationship between you and your--your brother, Abraham [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Jr].  Because you--you two--I understand that the rest of your family also, even some of your sisters were involved in civil rights, but you and your brother stand out.  Tell me about your relationship, being that he's an older brother and he's a Baptist preacher as well.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did you follow in his [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Jr.] footsteps and was there a competition between you two?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't always agree, and we don't always agree now.  And I've always been more outspoken.  He's [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Jr.]very outspoken but I've been more outspoken than any of 'em.  And I think sometimes he felt that he needed to protect me.  I was outgoing and I would really get out there and picket and get things going and get things started.  And I admit that I was rather hardheaded in some things.  I felt like I was being led by the spirit and would--would actually get out and grab something and wouldn't let it go.  And--but his example was very outstanding.  He became one of the vice presidents in the organization [Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights].  It was a while before I even got on the executive board.  And I got on the executive board when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came and noticed me working and they were having these central committee meetings and things of nature and I wasn't privy to it.  And he asked the question, why was I not a part of the executive group?  And this is when they permitted me to come in the group but I had been working around with everything heading up committees and groups and--and things of that nature.  I learned a lot from my brother [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Jr.], and I'm still learning a lot from him.  But I've always been kind of bullheaded in a way.  If I thought the Lord told me to do something, it didn't matter who told me not to.  I went on and--and endeavored to do that.
Story_ID: 106918
Speaker 1: Tell me about your--your first introduction to Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Well, I--I met Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] way before '63 [1963] when he came to Birmingham [Alabama].  The first time I saw him, he spoke at 16th Street--Street Baptist Church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] at a special program and I went to hear him but I did not know him.  In the--in '63 [1963] I did not know him personally, but he had been observing me and his people worked with him they had been observing. I was being faithful, that's just what I been doing all of the time.  And as time went on, Dr. King began sending me out of town to speak at some of his engagements.  He'd heard me preach and speak.  During that time he had more engagements than he could fulfill.  And he told me that his father liked me.  I ain't know his father.  Told me that his father liked me.  And matter of fact, they sent several of us off, I don't know whether it was school or what, to different seminars and conferences.  I was always chosen as one of them.  And he selected me to be the city convener of the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] in a program called the MLTP, that was to Ministers Leadership Training Program.  And I had responsibility to instruct ministers, hold classes for them.  I had spent thirteen weeks away and I'd come back in every week, paid the plane fare and everything.  And I had to teach them about black history, the importance of housing and other things, the art of negotiations.  And I did that for a while.  Set up a--a core [ph.] group.  And we would basically meet on Saturday and we would strategize for picketing at different places like that.  So Dr. King had a lot of confidence in me for some reason.  And if he'd ask me something I'd tell him I wouldn't do it, he wouldn't do it.  When they had gotten injunctions against Dr. King, Dr. Shuttlesworth [HM Fred Shuttlesworth], and the--the top leaders here, the Lord spoke to me and said, "Fear not deprivation."  And Dr. King asked me one morning he said, "Calvin what you think about this injunction?"  I said, "The Lord spoke to me and said, fear not deprivation."  So they didn't call you up to picket and all the-the demonstration hall.  They went on.  And I remember we were at a conference in, I believe, it was Pensacola, Miami, Florida.  And the word was out and that someone was probably there to do Dr. King some harm and he sent for me.  My room wasn't where his was, and I didn't actually know what to say I had to pray about it.  And when I got a clearance in my spirit it was all right.  And I sent word to him, he can come out, he came out.  A lot of people don't know this but he --he was a spiritual man.  He believed in God.  And the things that he did, he had to have had the spirit of God within him.  He was a--was a--was a chosen vessel and I was the last person with him when he left Birmingham [Alabama].  The last trip he made here he was riding in my car, yeah.  I carried him to the airport, special plane.  So you asked me how did I get to know him, maybe I's talked a little too much.  You didn't ask me about the relationship.
Speaker 1: But that--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's fine.  No that's fine.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 106919
Speaker 1: The classes that you were taking and then teaching the information to the ministers, you said you flew in and out of town.  Where were the classes held?
Speaker 2: In Chicago [Illinois], the Urban Training Center for Christian Missions [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And this was before--this was in '62 [1962] or '63 [1963]?  This would had to be in '63 [1963], right?
Speaker 2: Probably so.  I'm--I'd look at my certificates and--and see.  I'm not--it probably was or something during that time.  It was after he [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came here, you know, after we got a relationship.  Because our relationship went beyond '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, actually you began working with him with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] --
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was in '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I--I actually--yeah in '57 [1957].  Reverend Shuttlesworth [HM Fred Shuttlesworth] --I was not--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm
Speaker 2: --you know, considered one of the main leaders, but I was--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: But you were working with them.
Speaker 2: --I was working with them from the inception, from the very inception back there.
Story_ID: 106920
Speaker 1: Now, working as a city convener, what else, what other things were going on around--around town in Birmingham [Alabama] that you were involved in?  I know if you would speak to the 16th Street [Sixteenth Street Baptist Church] bombings and Fred Shuttlesworth [HM Fred Shuttlesworth] and the bombings at--at Bethel [Bethel Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] before that.  What were your thoughts and where were you in the scheme of things during that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I was busy, but there was more going on than that.  And we--we were just, I heard the explosion.  I didn't live to far from 16th Street [16th Street Baptist Church] up on the end of the ridge.  And it was a very difficult, difficult period during that time.  And, of course, I was beaten, when the A.G. Gaston Motel [A.G. Gaston Motel, Birmingham, Alabama] was bombed, just right across from where we are now.  They undoubtedly thought Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was there, but he had gone home to Atlanta [Georgia].  And we converged down here [A.G. Gaston Motel] and it was really a riot that took place.  Blacks began to try and do bodily harm to any whites who came through the--through the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And policemen converged on this area by the hundreds.  And buildings on this very street where we are, were set on fire.  Anything that belonged to--to whites were--were burning.  Set down cars were turned over.  Matter of fact, I saw one guy shoot a police man.  You didn't read about that.  I was looking at 'em.  Right up, he probably lost his sanity because all the police was around mob crowd they were gone wild.  They were just tired.  That weren't the first time they tried--they bombed this motel [A.G. Gaston Motel].  And they had bombed up on Center Street Hill [Center Street Hill, or "Dynamite Hill", Birmingham, Alabama], the civil rights lawyer's home, Lawyer Shores [Arthur Davis Shores] more than one time.  And it--it was very hazardous down here.  And after some of us worked very diligently to thin the crowd out, calming our people and telling them that wasn't the way.  And after we thinned the crowd out, it was before day in the morning.  When we thinned the crowd out, the police attacked us.  I have a little problem with this shoulder now.  And beat me on my shoulder in all.  So there were a lot of things going on but my work--I also witnessed where we worked with newspapers and encouraged newspapers to recognize black people to a higher degree.  And we also went to banks, other establishments asked them and--and businesses to advertise in black papers.  We also went to some of the businesses and encouraged them to make contribution to the black colleges.  It's a matter of record out at Miles [College], Birmingham Baptist Bible College [Birmingham, Alabama].  Another entity that we worked on were the bakeries.  They had no black drivers.  My program got that started.  It--but we didn't no credit for it--that, but we--we weren't trying to just do it publicity wise, we wanted it done.  And this is actually what happened to us.  People began to get jobs in other areas and when we saw that people wouldn't acquiesce with equity and give blacks jobs they should, we instituted picket--picketing at some of the main stores and to get black clerks and things of that nature and black managers there.  So those were some of the other things that we did.  And at some part in the effort I was over the security detail, the guards.  And I caught a man getting ready to do something to my brother's [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Jr.] church one night.  It was an auction told me to get up, got one of my sons and he was headed to the church with a sack in his hand.  And I turned the corner and he ran and got in his car.  And I got in my car and we were running behind him and then it dawned it on me, what are you gone do if you catch him?  So I stopped.  So there was--there are several things that--that went on probably the history books don't have, they couldn't--can't get everything that--that transpired.
Story_ID: 106921
Speaker 1: You talk about--you talk about security.  Did you know Colonel Stone Johnson and Joe Hendricks?
Speaker 2: Sure, very close friends.  They--they were security guards.  They basically guarded Reverend Shuttlesworth's [HM Fred Shuttlesworth] church and his house, yeah.  They--they were really very faithful. They were even moving dynamite.  Now my part in the security work did not involve guarding Reverend Shuttlesworth's home.  There were other leaders who I had to dispatch people during a critical period in guarding their homes.  We even got people to--to stand guard over our attorney's home, things of that nature.  So ours wasn't so overt but we headed that up for a while.
Speaker 1: You were a young man yourself during this time.  Did you have any involvement with the students, the Freedom--
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: --Freedom Riders or some of the students at Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] that had voters' registration drives and things.   (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes I did.  Part of my education came as a result of my being involved with Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama].  They had a program out there called the Miles College Citizenship Program.  And I worked with that program along with the students in registering people to vote.  And as a result of that, some of my schooling was paid for.  I was able to go back and get some--didn't finish it at that point but I was able to do that.  So students did work with us in the community and Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] was a big source of strength and--and help in the movement.  They [Miles College] did a great job.  And, of course, being involved with the students--I--I well you didn't ask me about my children, rather I didn't mention at that time, but some of my children went to jail.
Story_ID: 106922
Speaker 1: Were your children born at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, during the--during '63 [1963] some of my children went to--went to jail.
Speaker 1: Tell me about--tell me what--
Speaker 2: Three of 'em.
Speaker 1: Tell me your children's names.  Well let's--let's put 'em in rank and all of their names.
Speaker 2: (laughter) okay.  All of their names.  Let me see.  Jeanette [ph.] is the oldest, Jeanette.  Linda [ph.] who is a pastor now, minister, associate pastor, Linda.  Judy [ph.], who is just like my assistant at the church.  Sheila [ph.], who is deceased.  And Calvin, Jr.  Carlton [ph.], he's a pastor and Calvin is. Byron [ph.], who is a pastor.  Chris [ph.].  Timothy [ph.], who's a pastor.  Freedom [ph.] is a pastor.  Quintin [ph.] he was a pastor.  How many you have?
Speaker 1: Eleven.
Speaker 2: Ooh, who did I miss?   Oh, Joyce [ph.] and Angela [ph.] who is a minister.  You oughta have thirteen.
Speaker 1: So five of your boys are--are pastors?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how many of the females?
Speaker 2: Well, two of 'em--
Speaker 1: Two.
Speaker 2: --actually are in the pastorate work.  And another one I know she is but she teaches hers out and she doesn't call herself a--a minister but she's really--she is.  And she's--she is a minister.  But three of those went to jail the first, the oldest three--
Story_ID: 106474
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the children, the role of the children in the--in the Civil Rights Movement.  And you were telling me about how three of your children were--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Three of my children slipped without permission, got in the demonstrations and were arrested.  And, of course, as you know thousands of children were put out of school because they demonstrated.  I permitted the suit to be filed in my daughter's name, Linda Carol Woods [ph.] and others.  With the injunction we flew to Atlanta [Georgia] to federal court presided over by Judge Tuttle [Hon. Elbert Parr Tuttle].  And before day in the morning we were able to get him up, they had made contact.  And he issued an injunction against the Birmingham Board of Education [Birmingham, Alabama] and ordered them to permit children to go back to school.
Speaker 1: And when you worked with James Bevel [HM Reverend James Bevel], was he instrumental in getting the children to come out--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to--to demonstrate?
Speaker 2: Yes, James Bevel really was the motivating factor.  At first Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] did not think well of that.  But Bevel really was the one and at that time a lot of people thought he was really kind of out of sorts 'cause he was a dynamic and a very hard worker and great--great motivator, a great teacher.  So he is the one who really engineered that, 'cause it certainly had help and he was the--the engineer.
Story_ID: 106475
Speaker 1: Politics in Birmingham [Alabama], how did this change and we're still in 1963.  The city government was undergoing a major change, what did the voters decide to--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --to do going into it?
Speaker 2: Well that's why Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Birmingham [Alabama].  It was basically a--a political social situation.  The--a new form of government had been instituted.  And we had the commission formed but it had been changed to the mayor council form and the Mayor Albert Boutwell [Albert Burton Boutwell] had promised to do certain things and Dr. Shuttlesworth [HM Fred Shuttlesworth] gave them a time limit on it.  And with the understanding that if they didn't acquiesce with opening up everything at city hall and employ blacks in key positions, that demonstration would start.  They didn't believe that it--it would take--we were able to do it.  And this is why Dr. King--Dr. Shuttlesworth invited Dr. King to come as a result of the govern--city government's refusal to comply with the things that they promised that they would do.  And of course, as a result of the--the demonstration more blacks were registered to vote.  Police brutality still was somewhat on the rampant and because of that a black woman was killed by a police officer.  And as a result of that, we really got busy at registering people to vote as well as demonstrating.  As a result of that we--we elected the first black mayor [Richard Arrington, Jr.] in time to the city of Birmingham [Alabama].  And he remained mayor for, I guess, some twenty years.
Speaker 1: Is that Arrington [Richard Arrington, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Dr. Richard Arrington.  And he brought about a brand new day in this city of Birmingham [Alabama].  You talk about blacks being employed in the city hall, yeah.  They were employed across the board and in other areas, certainly of this city [Birmingham, Alabama].  Everything seemly correlated, one with the other.
Story_ID: 106476
Speaker 1: This was also a time that you were arrested again and had a confrontation with the Klan [Ku Klux Klan] at that time.  Tell me the--
Speaker 2: Well, I was arrested for integrating a downtown lunch counter.  And several whites crowded around us and one of the men spit on me.  And I told him thank you sir.  And a white man standing there couldn't take it.  He singlehandedly drove that entire group out of that--that eating establishment.  He did that.  Now talking about the Klan we had faced the Klan more than one time.  And on one occasion we faced the Klan, black woman dropped dead.  We were in Hewitt town helping that place.  Young man had been killed over there (unclear) and we--we--we were over there helping them.  And the Klan were in their regalia and some didn't even have the hoods on.  And Ms. Davis dropped dead.  On another occasion during the struggle, we went to Decatur, Alabama to assist the people there.  And the Klan took over the town, the police and everything and we had to run like rabbits.  It was pandemonium in the city of Decatur [Alabama].  And another time when we faced the Klan it was very horrifying.  We went to Forsyth, Georgia to help those people.  It was terrible.  This lady that comes on TV and got all that money, Oprah [Oprah Winfrey].  They brought her in to try to mediate the situation down there.  The Klan were all over the place.  They outnumbered the police men and all.  We had this big march.  It's nothing but the grace of God that brought us through.  It was out--(unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Is this the march that Hosea [Williams] had put together to Forsyth [County?], Georgia?
Speaker 2: Probably so.  I don't just recall who put it together, he probably did but we were there.  We faced the Klan and we've had instances where we've seen them here.  They'd always be dressed up--wouldn't always be dressed up.  But we--we--we have faced those things and I've suffice it to say, we've had some white people who stood up with us in the struggle against that dastardly behavior as well as blacks.
Story_ID: 106477
Speaker 1: Tell me what--LC--SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] launched Project C and when--can you tell me were those just the staged sit-ins from the Birmingham Manifesto?
Speaker 2: Well, probably so.  I so much I know and so much I don't know, yeah.  So much I know and so much I--I don't know.  But the--the--the main--major decisions were made upstairs in the--in the A. G. Gaston Building [Birmingham, Alabama] on the second floor.  That's where the major decisions were made.  And I'm told that that's where I was not privy to that when that was--was made.
Speaker 1: The March on Washington--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: How much did you participate in the organization of what would happen that day?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't participate too much in it other than our local--our local efforts in helping to mobilize our people.  And truthfully I didn't even attend the March on Washington.  I had a prior commitment to preach a revival in Gadsden, Alabama and that--I felt that I should not neglect and that is where I had to be.  Some of my members went but I--I felt led that I had to go and honor my commitment to preach the revival.  So I was not there.
Story_ID: 106478
Speaker 1: Now, there was another event that happened. You went together with your brother [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Jr.] and Height [HM Dorothy Height] and Johnny Lewis [John Robert Lewis] was there some type of injunction against racial demonstrations do you know what--what that was about?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember.  This may be the one, there were a number of them.  I--I was a part of the injunction, I was enjoined.  They got a group and I do recall the police came to my house before day in the morning, it was whole group of 'em plain clothing.  We were peeping out the curtain and my family was almost frightened to death.  We didn't know whether they were the Klan [Ku Klux Klan] or who they were.  But we made a decision that if they got us, they were gonna have to break in.  So we wouldn't open the door and they eventually left.  And we learned that they were going around serving injunction papers on who they called the leaders.  So I had gotten in that bracket as far as they were concerned at that time.  And that could have been the time that I told Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] you know don't fear deprivation.
Speaker 1: Tell me, were there some other things that you participated in, some other events that had to do with the county registrar's office that you protested against?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The protest that was organized--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --by Reverend Gardner [HM Reverend Gardner C. Taylor].
Speaker 2: Well, the--as I recall we had hundreds of people who marched and walked to the County Board of Registrars trying to register.  They were turning so many down.  So many people.  It was scandalous and ridiculous the type questions that were being--being asked.  So we continued to go up there and it was bad.  And I don't think we had this--this mandate one man, one vote.  It should have always been there.  But we had to go through--through a lot.  Had to sit-in up there in the hallways and--and all of that.  And I think that really did help them to open up.  And what we did, we called for nighttime registration.  We marched up there at night.  And I do think that was a child of Hosea Williams.  It sound like Hosea.  At night we were marching up to the courthouse.  We marched all downtown at night.  I remember one night [February 22, 1966] we had about three men to get shot 'cause we were marching down with Liberty Supermarket [Birmingham, Alabama] at that time.
Story_ID: 106479
Speaker 1: Tell me about that, yeah.  There were five men that got shot during that picket at Liberty Supermarket.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Well, I vividly recall there was a car, a white man in it, just sitting.  And all at once he gunned the accelerator and made an attempt to run into the crowd and the people.  Somehow he kind of got stalled.  And when we knew anything, the gun was firing.  Gun was firing.  It was pandemonium.  It was pandemonium.  It really was.
Speaker 1: So--that actually led to the boycott of the what?
Speaker 2: Liberty Supermarket.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Of that--just that store?
Speaker 2: Well Liberty left.   They actually--the manager of that place was named Stignani.  I remember the name Stignani, S-T-I-G-N-A-N-I.  He testified that he didn't have anything whatsoever to do with it.  Liberty [Supermarket] was a place where you could really get things very economical.  So we hated they had to go but they--they closed that big store down, it hadn't been in operation there for just a few years but we put the hurt on 'em.  And we wanted managers throughout the place and I think that could have been why we were down there to start with.  And they eventually put some managers down there and I don't think everybody was completely satisfied with it.  They eventually moved out of Birmingham [Alabama] proper over near Homewood [Alabama].  And the store stayed there for a number of years, but they're not there now.

Speaker 1: With Richard Arrington [Richard Arrington, Jr.] in office now, and you said that the increase of blacks in--in different positions, the city [Birmingham, Alabama] and the--city jobs as well.  Is the police department also fairly integrated at this time?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The police department now in my opinion, I believe, is probably maybe a majority black if not its half and half.  The police chief is a black woman.  Of course, during Mayor Arrington's administration he appointed the first black police chief [Johnnie Johnson].
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: He did that.  And blacks were promoted and it was a new day.  The blacks previously, the blacks had an organization, they had a strategy.  The blacks formed their own organization, the police department called The Guardians [Birmingham Guardians Association?].  And they could meet together and they didn't get into the fraternal order of police men [Fraternal Order of Police].  And this gave them a lot of stress.  And Mayor Arrington [Richard Arrington, Jr.] gave strong support to The Guardians.  And a lot--a lot--a lot took place.  So now a black man is heading up the police union here, yeah.
Story_ID: 106481
Speaker 1: So--so, you know, the voter registration, marches and the--the demonstration protest at Liberty [Supermarket] that was in '66 [1966], but just to go back a little--a little bit.  What are your memories of the assassination of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was one of the most saddest times that had ever transpired I believe in my life.  I--I know where I was when we got the information.  We were at Saint Paul Methodist Church [now Saint Paul AME Church Smithfield] in Smithfield [Birmingham, Alabama].  I had called a mass meeting.  And we were dealing with some things.   The church was packed.  I had various choirs there.  And Georgia Price, who had served as a confidant to Dr. Shuttlesworth [HM Fred Shuttlesworth] for many years, she came in along with Julia Rains, Shuttlesworth's cousin, and a few others and announced to us that Dr. King had been killed.  Of course, I learned later that they had had that information before they came and announced it but they, you know, held it.  And we just had to close--close the meeting out.  We just--we just couldn't--we just couldn't go on with the meeting.  The people were so unnerved.  We had to close that meeting out.  And it really took everybody a while to really realize the reality of what had transpired.  We just felt like--like as they say a wet dish rag for a long time.  We felt very weak for a long time.  It just didn't seem real.  We didn't want it--we did not want it to be real.  It was--it was very painful.  And it was very--very hurtful up to this present time.  And those who knew him, it's--it's very painful.  What he meant not just too black people but what he meant to this country and to this entire world.  He taught nonviolence.  There--I--I recall a time when a black guy was--a white guy was going along with us as if he was a part of us.  And Dr. King was up speaking in the L. R. Hall Auditorium [Birmingham, Alabama] one Saturday evening and he was talking about how May Britt married Sammy Davis, Jr., she's white.  And this guy jumped up on the stage and hit Dr. King in the face and was beating him.  And we would have killed the guy if it hadn't been for Dr. King.  I say we because I was trying to get to him to the others, you know.  At least wanted to beat up or something.  And Dr. King, "Don't hurt him.  Don't hurt him.  Don't hurt him.  (Unclear) got a few licks in all of 'em but, you know.  Said, "Don't hurt 'em."  Dr. King was a man of nonviolence.  He wouldn't let anybody hurt 'em.  'Cause we--we don't forget it was a black woman who tried to kill him at first, stabbed him in New York [City].  So he was a man of nonviolence.  Didn't want us to hurt the man--man having beat him up.
Story_ID: 106482
Speaker 1: What other memories do you have of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Well, I something I--I never asked her.  I said my wife [Lucille Woods] wouldn't never forget, but she's deceased now.  When he made his last speech here in Birmingham [Alabama] down in Bessemer [Alabama] about twelve miles from here and the church at that time was pastored by Reverend Woodson Fallon, Jr. [ph.] The program was going on, Dr. King had spoken.  And after a while he becked for me and he said, "Calvin, I'm ready to go."  So I told him, "Okay."  And we went out the side door, got in my old car and didn't have a nice car like I drive now.  You could see the floor if you look hard enough that cover would be moving.  And I had my son, Carlton [Woods] with me and we--we were on way back to the motel.  He said, "Calvin, how 'bout stopping at Salters [ph.].  Let's get us some barbeque sandwich."  And we stopped at Salters [ph.] and he said, "Get one for your wife too."  So he (laughter)--and she [Lucille Woods] was just thrilled when I told her Dr. King sent her that barbeque--queue sandwich.  He was--he was very--he was easy to talk to.  Very easy to talk to.  So he--he--he loved everybody but he was aware that a lot of people were not in his corner who were pretending.  And he say, "Calvin it's--I've gotten to the place where a lot of 'em I--I just can't trust 'em anymore."  But he was just a down-to-earth man, but he had the work.  And I think he was very--I know he was very--very sincere man.  He was a praying man.
Story_ID: 106483
Speaker 1: What were some of the things after King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death that the people of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and the different organizations continued to--to strive for civil rights in the civil rights voting right act [Voting Rights Act of 1965] was signed and what are some of the things that are going on now in Birmingham [Alabama]?  And--and tell me what you were involved in (unclear) from that time until now as far as organizations.
Speaker 2: Well, one of my main concerns was then and still is now is being concerned about the crime rate.  To--so many of our people seems they have turned away from nonviolence and we miss Dr. King in that area.  He taught love.  He taught nonviolence.  That's not being taught on a scale.  We had hoped that when blacks got into positions of leadership as politicians, we thought maybe that was going to just about change everything.  But it helped in a lot of areas and some areas it diluted our will and resolve to stand up because--
Speaker 1: Hold on one second.  I'm sorry go ahead.
Speaker 2: It moved us up the road.  When as a result of voter registration and blacks got into position.  But in some respect, it diluted and--and dampened our resolve and initiative to press forward 'cause we're just looking for them to do so many things and just 'cause a person in office, he can't do everything and she can't do everything.  And there were times when probably we should have been demonstrating against certain issues probably in the government and city and we held back because we didn't want to embarrass people who we had put in office.  So there has been a cooling off period.  And we're not getting the dynamics of a lot of teaching that we need.  We--we're trying to do better now.  Many of the persons of strength who were in the civil rights movement have moved on to other jobs and positions after King.  And they got into other organizations and other business endeavors and it crippled King's organization.  And just as the Bible said," In the course of time, there arose--arose a Pharaoh who knew not Joseph." [Exodus 1:8]  A lot of people working for us, don't even know what's it's all about, working with us.  They don't know about the dynamics of the struggle.  So now our--our big problem is working against the violence that's perpetrated by us as black people now.  And we are not together as we--we were.  We had a common enemy we felt this injustice, you know.  And we were working against that and discrimination but now look like in many instances the common enemy is us.  We got to try to fight with us.  We're doing most of the killing and which is making it so bad.  And I--I spend a great deal of my time trying to bring both programs and things like that to motivate us to stop that and--and to love one another.  It's--it's an uphill struggle.  And even in some of our-- government don't seem to understand that.
Story_ID: 105447
Speaker 1: We were talking earlier about the transfer of the heart of the older generation to a younger generation to carry on.  And I know recently that SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] just opened up a new multimillion dollar building.
Speaker 2: I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were talking about SCLC and I was--we were talking actually about the transfer of the heart from one generation to the next.  And the fact that L--SCLC has just opened a brand new multimillion dollar building.  And you see most of the--the older people there.  Is there a transfer of the heart?  What is SCLC doing now to--to make that transfer to the next generation?
Speaker 2: Well, SCLC I feel is going through a revival.  The times are different now.  And it's a blessing that they have--we've opened this building.  And it--it basically is financed by gifts of the people, did that who have faith in SCLC.  SCLC is a living entity and it's also a symbol.  You move SCLC up from the social fabric and (unclear) politic of this nation, and we'll certainly be in more trouble by virtue of the fact what SCLC stands for, what its mission is.  Worldwide, SCLC is known to be an organization that works to alleviate social conflict.  Deals with conflict resolution things of this nature.  You--you need--you need that symbol.  Just like the fire department you hope you don't need it at your house but you won't feel safe if the fire department is not there.  So I feel that SCLC is on the comeback.  And a lot of people don't want it to come back.  They feel they have a lot to lose because a lot of folk don't want to do right.  And so it--it's really a struggle.  And many of us are being revived in our resolve to actually work for the things of the SCLC.  And as I mentioned earlier, a lot of persons who know about the work have gotten busy in other areas and some of them--them are having second thoughts about how they put their hand to the Gospel plow and looked back.  There are many thought that the politicians would be able to do it.  But there's always--will always be a need for the voice of the prophet and those who will represent the prophets.  I mean the people out in the community (unclear) politicians can't be any stronger than the people in the community, what the people allow them to do.  But I think SCLC is being revived.  We still have a long way to go by virtue of the fact that building down there.
Story_ID: 105448
Speaker 1: It shows that there has been some leadership in order to motivate people to even work with you to put up a building like that.  So what we have to do now, is see as Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] wrote his book, "Where Do We Go From Here To Chaos or Community?"  Look like we got some chaos.  And we trying to work toward bringing about a better community.  A lot of time a wild plant gets in the mix and you can't do too much until you get the wild plant out.  And I think SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] is going through a--a period of sifting now.  And by her being on the scene is making things better.  It would be worse if--if we weren't on the scene.  We still working at every voter registration, conflict resolution.  We're fighting against crime.  We're concerned about the--the environment overall it, SCLC is concerned about justice being done to all people regardless of their race, color, or creed.  So we're still working trying to carry the mission out.  And just as in years past, more money came in to SCLC for more people, but now it's a hard struggle just to get funds to do what you--you ought to do.  Even in--in cities like--like our city they put out a lot of money but SCLC is not getting not one dime from our city government [Birmingham, Alabama].  We helped to put it in place but they've given--given money to some other organizations.  So who--who aren't doing anything, just in place.  So I--I'm sure that's prevalent in other places but people have to assess it as they see it.  So I guess they feel that their little organization may be more in line with what they are doing than others.  A man called me from Mobile [Alabama] and was telling me about their program in Mobile [Alabama] how that they are supporting this type work.  And he was just appalled that our people here are not supporting SCLC.  We have a gun buy back every year.  Getting guns off the street.  I have to get out and beg and recruit that money.  We pay for people to bring guns in.  Now it seem like our--our cities, good a job as its doing, should volunteer some funds and--and support that.  We turn the guns over to the police department [Birmingham Police Department] when we get them.  So we've come a long way but I'm just being factual there, we still have a long way to go in some areas.  And then some people feel like SCLC is not--what is it doing?  It's struggling to stay in line with this mission.
Speaker 2: Is there something in place to transfer the knowledge of the--and the experiences of the older generation to the new generation that will take over?
Speaker 1: Well, there is a hard struggle.  And big money is behind it, according to my experience, to keep us from being able to really train.  You think you've got 'em something come up and scuttle 'em in another direction.  It's a hard sell.  You can't do too much without money.  You can't do--so it's a struggle.  We have to do that.  You know I'm--I'm struggling trying to effectuate younger people in to this work.  Got my son-in-law and many--my grandson and many other young men working with us.  'Cause I--I'll spread it out more or less, I guess, seven months a year than we been in a long time.  But we--we still have a long way to go.  And one of our biggest problems is funding.  If you gone--gonna maintain young people you got to be able to have something to have the type programs that would interest them and involve them in it.  You can know what to do but you've got to have some--something to do it with.  And, of course, I think we're doing a fairly good job, but we're not doing an excellent job at this time.  I think we--it's fair.  It's fair.  So, but we're doing it.  And it's gonna get better.
Story_ID: 105449
Speaker 1: Now let's talk more about you and your journey through school.  You--you told me earlier that you would take classes here and classes there and finally was in 1976 that you got your--
Speaker 2: Graduated from Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama].
Speaker 1: From Miles College.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: A B--a BA [Bachelor of Arts] in?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In social science?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And you graduated the same day as your daughter?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--and how was the family--
Speaker 2: Well it--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: How did--how did they do--they were--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: --elated I'm sure.
Speaker 2: It was very exciting.  My journey is a journey that the Lord put me on.  And this work I do it's the Lord's work.  I have no--no other alternative.  He put me into this work so whatever I have to do regardless of how long it takes, I have to strive to do what I know the Lord has called me to do.
Speaker 1: You were talking about your schooling and you had received your--your BA [Bachelor of Arts] in Social Science in 1976.  But I wanted to ask you about theological school number one.  And number two is, where did you begin to preach?  Where--what--what was the name of the first church that you preached?
Speaker 2: All right.  Briefly, I received my Bachelor of Theology and my Bachelor of Religious Education from the Birmingham-Easonian Baptist Bible College [Birmingham, Alabama].  I've also been granted an honorary Doctorate of Divinity Degree from that institution [Birmingham-Easonian Baptist Bible College].  I also earned a Doctor of Divinity Degree before I received them from Baptist College [Birmingham-Easonian Baptist Bible College], from the Union of Baptist Seminary.  That institution [Union of Baptist Seminary] also conferred a Doctor of Laws Degree upon me.  I received a Master of Bible Study from the Universal Bible Institute [Birmingham, Alabama].  And I also earned a Doctor of Divinity Degree from Universal [Universal Bible Institute].  I--
Speaker 1: Universal Bible--
Speaker 2: Bible institute.
Speaker 1: Institute.
Speaker 2: I--I also did graduate work.  I didn't tell you that, at the University of Alabama in Birmingham [University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama] in agency counseling.
Story_ID: 105450
Speaker 1: Now, the first church that you preached--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Where did you get your--your license?  Where were you ordained?
Speaker 2: I was licensed and ordained by my father [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.], Pastor of the Shiloh Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama].  My first pastorate was at the Golden Sons Lodge Hall.  That's the group of religious people who asked me to come and be their pastor.  I pastored there for two years.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year it was?
Speaker 2: Oh, I believe it could have been in 1957, could have been.
Speaker 1: And where did you--
Speaker 2: --or '58 [1958] or '58 [1958].  I'm not sure.  And I've pastored other churches since then after leaving Golden Son [Golden Sons Lodge Hall], I was called to the East End Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama].
Speaker 1: And how long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was there at East End [Baptist Church] for about seventeen years, I believe.
Speaker 1: Where is it located?
Speaker 2: 2609 Sixth Avenue South here in Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 1: So you were there for seventeen years?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--and where did you go next?
Speaker 2: I went to Roby's, R-O-B-Y, apostrophe S, Roby's Chapel [Unknown] for one year.  And from there I went to Believer's Temple Baptist Church [now Believer's Temple Church? Birmingham, Alabama], the church I organized.
Speaker 1: So you were the founder and organizer?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: This was about the end of--let me try to see, it was about 1970--maybe it was around 1978 or '79 [1979] maybe.
Speaker 1: How long were you at Roby's Chapel [Unknown]?
Speaker 2: Not quite a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you were at East End Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama] for seventeen years.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You went there in '60 [1960] and left '77 [1977], right?  Would that be right?
Speaker 2: 'Cause what--what year did I go to East End [Baptist Church]?
Speaker 1: Well, you said Golden Sons [Lodge Hall] you were there from '58 [1958] to '60 [1960].
Speaker 2: About two years, I believe.
Story_ID: 105451
Speaker 1: So--and then from '60 [1960] to '77 [1977] would be seventeen years at East End Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: '77 [1977] to '78 [1978] at Roby's Chapel?
Speaker 2: I was there approximately one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was another denomination church, AOH [Apostolic Overcoming Holy Church of God].
Speaker 1: AOH [Apostolic Overcoming Holy Church of God]?  What does that stand for?
Speaker 2: Apostolic Overcoming Holy Church of God.  That's the church my grandmother [Rebenia Frazier] came up in.
Speaker 1: That particular church or that denomination?
Speaker 2: That denomination, not that church, that denomination.
Speaker 1: And so it would be somewhere between say--like '78 [1978], '79 [1979] that you founded Believer's Temple [Baptist Church]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how long did you pastor there [Believer's Temple Baptist Church]?
Speaker 2: Well, I pastored there, I believe, approximately was eight or nine years because I've been at Shiloh [Baptist  Church] where I'm now--now pastor twenty-one years.
Speaker 1: And tell me about Shiloh.
Speaker 2: Shiloh is a great church.  Pastored by my father [Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.] approximately forty years.  I was brought up in that church, basically.  Went out into the ministry, pastorage from that church.  And that's somewhat of a family church according to us.  Of course, most of my sons are out pastoring and daughters--two daughters of the wives of pastors, they're--they're involved.  So this Shiloh Baptist Church stands with me in my work.  Since being pastor there, I became president of the New Era Baptist State Convention.  My father was a moderator.  My convention consists of three districts and I have three district moderators.  And I'm the state president, that is the umbrella over those churches.  And I also am president of--founder of the Intercessory Prayer Ministry.  It's nothing fanfare.  I call different people from time to time and--and ask them to pray for situations that are going on.  So we--the Lord has blessed us a great deal since we've been at Shiloh.  And we are not what you call a very large church but I consider Shiloh to be a--a spiritual church.  And a church that is forward thinking 'cause they support me and have my vision.  They didn't always have it, but I've striven to teach and to preach, and we are more alike, many of us.  You won't always have one hundred percent.
Story_ID: 105452
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, is there anything that you would change?
Speaker 2: Yes, there are some things that I'd change if I could go back over my life.  I feel that in some areas I've wasted some time.  I--it takes time for you to grow up and realize that some things are not necessary.  And I would be more studious.  I'd be a better man.  I'd be a better man.  'Cause and God knows that.  So I've--I've been busy.  I've been busy but a lot of times you get busy doing some things that you didn't have to do, yeah.  I would do that.  I'd be a little more wiser.  Some things I didn't know that I wasn't being wise about.  And I guess that's--that comes with the territory.  You have to grow up.
Speaker 1: You have thirteen children and how many grandchildren?
Speaker 2: About fifty-six, I believe.
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I want my legacy to be that I was a true man of God.  And if I can have that--because that's true.  I don't claim to be a perfect man of God but I am a man of God who love him perfectly with all my heart.  And that's the--that's the--that's the greatest legacy that anybody can have.  That's what I want.
Speaker 1: Since this tape is going to be available for future generations, what message would you like to send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: If we're going to be people of God, let's make certain that we put God first.  And always keep a praying spirit.  And it's a verse that stays on my heart constantly, and some people call me the prayer minister 'cause I--I pray practically everywhere I go.  And I think about Second Chronicles 7:13.  "If my people called by my name will humble themselves and pray, seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven will forgive their sins and heal their land."  Prayer is a method of communicating with God.  It's the language to hold the family.  It's a method of problem solving.  And prayer means power.  It's an anxiety healer.  So I pray that this nation will really be a praying nation.  Stay before God because it is really a source of strength, prayer.
Story_ID: 105453
Speaker 1: What is your main concern for the African American community?
Speaker 2: My main concern for the African American community, I feel that we have strayed.  Many of us have gotten off course.  Whereas we need things, God intends for us to have things, I feel that we have, for the most part, are putting things before people, before spiritualty.  The Lord says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.  And all of these things will be added to you." [Matthew 6:33]  So we need to--we need a great revival of the spirit of God among our people.  We don't have that love that--that seemingly we had, particularly during the height of the civil rights struggle and in the 60's [1960s].  We loved one another.  We need to turn to each other and stop turning on each other.  That's one of our main problems, we're trying to seemingly put Jesus Christ on the back burner.  And God is a jealous God and we're making gods--false gods out of so many things.  So many things.  So many are pretending to know God in actuality who don't really know him by their actions.  And we are a special people.  And--but it's bad when--when we as special people jump the track.  Now when I say that I don't mean everybody but we are concerned about the least of those among us.  So those are my concerns right there.
Speaker 1: If there were one sentence that you like to hear people say about you, what do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: I want them to say that Calvin was really sincere in his relationship with God, and his concern for people.
