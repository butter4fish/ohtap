JW: This is Jessie Wilkerson and I&#8217;m at the home of Gail Randolph and we are in Unicoi, Tennessee, and the date is May 16, 2011. So Gail, could you start by telling me when and where you were born?
GR: I was born here in Unicoi County in 1947.
JW: Were you born at home?
GR: Yes. Actually I was a large child. I weighed fifteen pounds. (laughs)
JW: Really?
GR: Yeah. So I always had a story to tell. (laughs)
JW: Did your mother tell you stories about you being born?
GR: Yes, said everybody come to see that big baby. So I use that as an excuse now for not being tiny. I say, &#8220;Well, I wasn&#8217;t meant to be. The good Lord didn&#8217;t make me small.&#8221;
JR: Can you tell me about your parents?
GR: I don&#8217;t remember a whole lot. Like I said, I have a problem now with my memory. I just remember my dad being real strong. Daddy was a mountain man. Daddy didn&#8217;t have a lot of education, but he had a lot of common sense and Daddy was a moonshiner. That&#8217;s really good memories now. I wished I&#8217;d have realized when I was younger to pay attention more to things, write down things, but I didn&#8217;t. But I just have a lot of good memories of Daddy being a moonshiner and I remember hiding. He sold liquor. So we would help put it in bottles and help hide it. You never come to the door to buy it. He would always hide it odd places like under a stump by the road or under a chicken&#8217;s nest. So it was fun. It was like watching a movie, but it was my life.
I don&#8217;t remember a lot about Mama. There were six kids and we were really poor and Mama had a hard time and she was just always working and doing Mama stuff. And I married at fourteen. So then I was on my own, surviving and doing my thing. So that&#8217;s why I really don&#8217;t remember a lot about them.
JW: What number child were you?
GR: I was the third. I was the one that Mama would tell the older sister to do, go carry water. Lynn would tell Rosie and then Rosie would make me. (laughs) The ones younger than me was too little to pass it on. So it seemed to be I was the one that was always getting the water, carrying the water. So that&#8217;s it.
JW: Did your mother ever work outside the home or was she mostly taking care of you all?
GR: I think at one time she did work at the pottery here in Erwin, but I don&#8217;t remember. I just remember hearing them say that she did. But that&#8217;s all I can remember of that.
JW: And your father was mainly a moonshiner?
GR: Daddy, well, he raised gardens and he got wood. At one time when we lived in Indiana, I think it was, he was a butcher. I don&#8217;t know if he was just like a helper or whatever, but mainly just moonshine. That&#8217;s all I remember because, at the time, I was born after the war, the depression was just over, people were very poor and doing the best they can. And that seemed to be an embarrassing thing at the time, but now that I look back on it, that was alright. He was doing what he had to do and it worked, and he wasn&#8217;t the only one. There was a lot in the mountains here in Tennessee.
JW: You said you moved to Indiana?
GR: When we were small, we went up there for a year or two. We lived in Indiana for a while. We lived in Pennsylvania for a while. I think Daddy worked in the canneries, but I don&#8217;t really remember a lot about that. I just remember a little bit of living there. Pennsylvania, we lived with this one woman. I just remember really being hungry and cold. Times was hard, but I remember this neighbor lady. She had a lot of kids. She had a big old pot like a restaurant would have, and she would cook that pot full of soup beans. And she had these noodles and I think they was called popeye noodles. It looked like a bowtie and when the beans got almost done, she would put them in there and cook them with the beans and it made almost like a dumpling in the beans. I remember the first time I ever sat down at her table. It was real long, all these kids around this table, and I was just excited to get to be one of them. And she had this big old dipper that she ladled down into that and she filled out plates until the soup run over the sides of the plate, and I was in heaven. I still remember her and I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s not alive now, but I loved that woman. (laughs) That was a good memory. But that&#8217;s about it. Like I said, I married at fourteen. I was on my own then and life changed.
JW: So what was school like before you got married?
GR: I didn&#8217;t get to go to school very long. I went four years. I went through the fourth. I think I went the first day of fifth grade. And my sister had married really young and was living in High Point, North Carolina, and was having a bad marriage, or not a bad marriage, a bad pregnancy, and was having to stay in bed and she needed somebody to come take care of her. So they took me out of school and sent me to go stay with her. I always felt like with no thought to me because I loved school and my teachers liked me and I&#8217;d draw for them. Anytime a holiday come up, I got to do the art of drawing big scenes on the blackboard and they&#8217;d always beg me, &#8220;Keep going to school. We want you to go take art,&#8221; and encourage me.   But they took me out of school to go stay with her. I stayed with her a year, maybe two years. I can&#8217;t remember exactly how long. That&#8217;s where I met Richard. He come over there. He was a friend of her husband and he come there to find work. We just sat around the table and played cards. I never dated him, never was alone with him, never went anywhere with a car, never kissed him. And my sister was young and she started saying, &#8220;You and Richard ought to get married and we&#8217;ll all go to Oregon and they can work,&#8221; and just painting this beautiful picture in my mind. Because I could imagine these big trees, so big you can drive a car through them, but God knows I couldn&#8217;t imagine marriage. But he went along with it and before I knew it, I was married.   And I didn&#8217;t know nothing about life. Nothing. Now four-year-olds, five-year-olds, because of TV, knows more than I knew at fourteen. But they used to have this old saying: &#8220;You made your bed. Now you got to lay in it.&#8221; So I know that and you just do. You just do what you got to do. He was twenty and I was fourteen. And of course, he was handsome. I can&#8217;t say there wasn&#8217;t some love there, but at fourteen, you don&#8217;t know about love and life and whatever. I was married I think five months when I got pregnant because I didn&#8217;t know how not to get pregnant. I didn&#8217;t know nothing about nothing. When I was pregnant, we stayed with his mama and here and there, didn&#8217;t have a home. We were just surviving. Allen was born and I had a real bad time when he was born. I remember Mama watched me give him his first bath and change his diaper and she said, &#8220;You&#8217;re doing as good as I could.&#8221; So that&#8217;s all the help I ever got. So that&#8217;s how it started out.  JW: Did Richard ask you to marry him or how did that--?  GR: Oh yes, oh yes. He was sweet and I&#8217;m sure he probably liked me better than I liked him or maybe I liked him. When you&#8217;re fourteen, you think if somebody&#8217;s handsome and he was handsome. Remember back when Elvis and Fabian and all them? You probably don&#8217;t remember. But he was real dark-skinned and had real black hair and his leather jacket, and he was cool. He was really respectful to me. Men was really different how they treated women then and now. But it was just hard times. People were really poor. He was a carpenter and he just worked here and there and he was young. He had a lot to learn. I can&#8217;t say it was all bad. There was good times. It&#8217;s just sometimes there&#8217;s so many bad times, it&#8217;s hard to remember the good. But we had four kids and they all lived and I&#8217;ve got them all raised and I&#8217;m very proud of every one of them. Like I said, my son died in 2001. Richard died in 2000 and Allen died in 2001. And when Allen died, that messed my memory up and I just can&#8217;t remember things. Pain don&#8217;t go away. You learn to live with it, but it don&#8217;t go away and it affects different people different ways.   JW: Can you tell me what it was like to be a young mother?  GR: Oh I loved it. The times was hard because we lived in some houses that we didn&#8217;t have electricity. I had to carry my water. I had to get my wood off the mountain. It was hard times, but as far as being a mother, I loved it. I loved my babies because they&#8217;re the only real thing to ever love me back that was mine, and I have a lot of regrets from my life and in my past that I would have done different if I&#8217;d have a choice. If I could have grown up and if I could have went to school, if I could have been an educated women, I would have changed all that. I would have done all those things because I&#8217;ve always wondered who would I have been, but fate stepped in. That&#8217;s what happened. You do what you got to do. But I do not ever regret having my children because that&#8217;s the ultimate love and that&#8217;s the ultimate warmth. No matter where you live, I always made a home. I always made it colorful. I always picked wildflowers to have on the table. Like I said, I remember being cold. I always remember being cold and hungry and I had this in me that I wouldn&#8217;t do that. We might live in a bad house, but my house would be clean. There would be plenty food. If it was just one bowl of something, it would be a full bowl. There would always be warm. I don&#8217;t think my girls, I don&#8217;t know what their memories, good or bad, but it wouldn&#8217;t be that.   So I guess we all make mistakes as parents, but you just do the best you can do at the time and I&#8217;m sure Mama did the best she could at her time because now that I&#8217;m grown and look back, it was bad times then for everybody. I could have done better if I&#8217;d have been older, if I&#8217;d  been more mature. No child should have a baby at fifteen. How can you raise a baby when you&#8217;re a baby? And I do believe more educated people raise more educated children. That&#8217;s just a fact and thank God, we&#8217;ve all growed and matured since then. Now they&#8217;d never allow a child to marry at fourteen, but times was different then and so we did the best we could with what we had to do it with.   JW: How was finding work for Richard?  GR: Oh, he never had a problem finding work. He was a good carpenter. He worked really hard, but he was young and he wanted to party and had a lot of friends. He&#8217;d make it and give me a little bit and spend the rest of it. He never really tried to have anything. That&#8217;s just how it was and I can&#8217;t blame him. I can, but I can&#8217;t because he was--. And I didn&#8217;t fuss when he would get drunk or not come home or not bring any money. I wouldn&#8217;t say anything. It was just like why? What would be the point? It wasn&#8217;t going to fix it. It wasn&#8217;t going to change anything, and I wasn&#8217;t going to live like that. I&#8217;m not going to live fighting. I&#8217;m not going to live. And I wasn&#8217;t going to leave him. I married him forever. I was young, but I realized when you marry, you marry forever. When you make a promise, that&#8217;s it. So God knows I wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. So I didn&#8217;t fuss about nothing. I had my feelings heard or whatever, but I just let it go. In a few days, it&#8217;d be forgotten and everything would be fine and then he&#8217;d do it again and it was just how it was.   But I growed up. You just learn a lot. We raised our kids and I guess, like I said, I have looked back and I think if I could have growed up, if I could have went to school, I would have learned a lot of things, but I didn&#8217;t. You can look back and &#8220;if&#8221; your life away, but you can&#8217;t change the past. All you do is change the future. But they all turned out healthy. Like I said, the girls have got six grandbabies now and three great-grandbabies and God, that&#8217;s awesome. That is the pride of my life.  JW: What was your wedding day like?   GR: Well, I do remember having a white dress. I had to go to the courthouse. Daddy was cooking and Mama and Daddy both had to sign. We was going to go down the river to this preacher&#8217;s house. His name was Preacher Dugan. He&#8217;s gone now. And he couldn&#8217;t do it there because that was Washington County and the license was from Unicoi County. So they had to go back up to the county line and we got married beside the river. But that&#8217;s all I remember about that. It&#8217;s been a lifetime ago, girl. It&#8217;s a lifetime.   JW: When you were younger, before you got married, what did you imagine you might be or you might do when you were an adult? Did you ever think about that?  GR: No. I just know I loved art. I really loved art. I was a nut. I always cut up. I was the clown. I loved making people laugh. Of course, I loved talking. You can tell that. And my teachers liked me and I loved school. I really loved school. I just remember I was always putting on a play, a pretend play. I&#8217;d have a friend. I&#8217;d make us. I remember taking the mop and stood it up and I had the mop head and I fixed it in pigtails and put a face on it, and I would do this stupid little skit. And I remember Mama and everybody laughing. That was my part was just being funny and silly, but the main thing was I just loved art. I wished I could have went to school for that. After getting married and having kids, you don&#8217;t daydream about things you know that you can&#8217;t have or you can&#8217;t change. It was as I got older when I started getting up in my 20s that I would daydream of &#8220;what if."   But I was always thankful, though, for everything I had. I was thankful for my children&#8217;s health because Angie got really sick when she was little and almost died. It makes you think I wouldn&#8217;t change her. If I could wish for anything, instead of wishing for wealth or whatever, I would wish for her to be fine. And then Allen&#8217;s appendix busted when he was nine and that was a terrible thing. We didn&#8217;t have a phone, didn&#8217;t have a car. If my sister hadn&#8217;t come and got me to go spend the night with her--. It just seems like the good Lord just always took care of me and put me in the right place. I was up in Bumpass Cove way up in that mountain and she needed me to come to Erwin and spend the night. And the next day, we was going actually to Johnson City near the hospital and she saw her visit and he was getting worse with the vomiting and the pain. And I took him to the emergency room, and he went straight from the emergency room to the operating room.  Things through my life has fell in place. It&#8217;s like lessons I believe I had to learn through life, hard times. It was hard, but everything that was hard, I learned from that. Each time I got stronger. I remember so many times thinking I don&#8217;t know--. Somewhere strength comes, because I used to get real, when you&#8217;re young, you want to be young. You want to do things. But I would get so depressed, I guess, or I don&#8217;t know if I could call it depressed, but it&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Why not me?&#8221; You see other girls driving with a pretty car, pretty clothes, or whatever, and I think, &#8220;Why not me? Why me? Why am I having to go through all this stuff?&#8221; Then somewhere I&#8217;d say, somewhere strength come from somewhere, I didn&#8217;t know where. And then I&#8217;d start saying, &#8220;But, you&#8217;ve got your kids. They&#8217;ve got good health. You&#8217;ve got good health.&#8221; And I&#8217;d start thinking all these things and everything fell in place and so many times through life, I thought and I&#8217;d get the strength. I didn&#8217;t know where it come from.   And then when Allen died, I kept working. I was cleaning for people and I kept working just out of habit. And I was driving back home, lived on Cherokee, Johnson City then. About a week later, I was driving home, and it was almost like a film in my mind going off of my life and I was seeing everything that ever happened from first marriage, from when Allen was first born. Stuff I had forgot was coming back to me and it was like somebody was telling me like you would talk to me and it said, &#8220;I was standing behind you and I was holding you up, but you didn&#8217;t see.&#8221; And then it reminded me of when Allen&#8217;s appendix and how things worked out for me to get here to be to a doctor and it said, &#8220;I was standing behind you and I was holding you up, but you didn&#8217;t see.&#8221; And when Angie got sick that time, everything kept coming back and right on down to when Allen died, and I guess that was the most faith I ever had in my life. And it said, &#8220;And I was standing there and I was holding you up and you saw.&#8221;   Because when I was sitting in the funeral home and I was looking at him, I wasn&#8217;t screaming and I wasn&#8217;t crying, and my youngest daughter, Rachel (20:43), she said, &#8220;Mama, you don&#8217;t have to be so strong.&#8221; And I wasn&#8217;t, but I guess I was. They thought I was, but I was looking at him and I was thinking how lucky he was to use such a beautiful body because I knowed he wasn&#8217;t here no more. I wasn&#8217;t going to disrespect his life or his funeral, and it wasn&#8217;t about me that day. It wasn&#8217;t about me.   After he was buried, my neighbor come and brought me two little yellow rose bushes. I was feeling so much pain and anger and just regret that I got so mad when I seen them rose bushes, but I thanked her. I was being nice and when she walked away, I thought, &#8220;What am I going to do with these rose bushes? What?&#8221; Something told me again, said, &#8220;This ain&#8217;t you. This is not you.&#8221; And I got these ideas just come in my head, and I had yellow irises blooming early the next morning and I had these two concrete blocks that you make a bench out of. And I didn&#8217;t have the bench top, but I had this big plank and I dug up every yellow iris I had and I took them yellow rose bushes and I bought grass seed and I took wind chimes and I took a bird feeder and I took mulch and my car was loaded down. And I went up there and I covered Allen&#8217;s grave and there was no more red clay. And I had two boxes of wildflower seeds and I planted them wildflower seeds and I planted them yellow irises and I planted them two yellow rose bushes. And I put that bench and I put an arbor over it and I put a bird feeder and I filled it up and I put wind chimes.  And I turned his grave into a flower garden because we live and we die. That&#8217;s just life and everybody believes different things, and I believe in God with all my heart. And Allen wasn&#8217;t a perfect person, by no means, but he had got saved and I knew he was gone and everything was fine. And when I went to the cemetery, I felt peace there. I felt peace. I put a can on that bench. I nailed it on and I put paper and pencil in that can and I&#8217;d be up here cleaning or working and I just had to go talk to him. I just had to go write a note and say, &#8220;Today&#8217;s your birthday.&#8221; And he wasn&#8217;t here. That took about a year and time passes and it eases, but it&#8217;s still a pretty flower garden. So it wasn&#8217;t long after that until I decided I need to go and clean up a spot bigger for myself and the other kids because death comes fast and most people are not prepared for it. I thought, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to put my kids through that. I want to be prepared.&#8221; So I&#8217;ve got rose bushes and flowers planted up there and I moved the bench back and everything. It&#8217;s pretty and it&#8217;s comfortable and it&#8217;s peaceful.   What I loved about that bench is I took paint and a brush and I wrote on the end of that, on the corner, &#8220;The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.&#8221; And I just left the paint and the brush, not thinking, and when I went back a week later, there was names all over that bench. All of his friends that went up to the cemetery, they all wrote stuff they wanted to write and it was like that was a healing bench. I had to flip it over and it was like maybe three foot long, a foot wide, and it was so covered in carvings and where they&#8217;d wrote on it that I had to flip it over so they could write on the other side. So that was, I guess, a healing thing for the girls, for myself, for his friends, for his kids.   So I&#8217;ve got it fixed it now and I took my granddaughter because she&#8217;s the youngest. Her name&#8217;s Olivia, and I about raised her too. And I was just afraid. I was having pains, chest pains, and I thought, &#8220;Lord, I&#8217;m going to die.&#8221; And I thought if I die, the girls will be feeling what they feel, but they won&#8217;t give Olivia a thought. So I took her up to the cemetery. I said, &#8220;I need you to go help me clean, baby.&#8221; And we was up there just cleaning up flowers and planting stuff. She was asking about the stones and I said, &#8220;Well, baby, this is a cemetery. Some people call it a graveyard.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Now you remember when your rabbit died and we buried him in the backyard? Well, you can&#8217;t bury people in the backyard.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But this is where you bury people.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Now when Nana dies, this is where they&#8217;ll put me and this is where you&#8217;ll come visit me at.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;But it won&#8217;t be sad.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Now if the good Lord lets me, when you see a butterfly or when you see the flowers blooming or birds singing, it might be me talking to you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Because if God lets me, I&#8217;ll be your guardian angel.&#8221; And she just said, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; (laughs) So in the innocence of a child, she understood. So I feel like I&#8217;ve got that all took care of now.  JW: May I ask how Allen died?  GR: Well, he died of, it wasn&#8217;t actually an overdose, but I guess it was. It took over a year to get his autopsy back. He, I&#8217;m sure, his whole life had probably done things and took stuff and never dreamed it would hurt him, but he&#8217;d had five teeth cut out. He was taking pain medicine for that and a friend come by and give him something. But anyway, the autopsy said he had three pain medicines in him, but neither one was over a legal dose and the only thing they could figure was that maybe the three together had just stopped his heart. See, that&#8217;s where a lot of the anger comes from. It&#8217;s why, why would you do that? But he wasn&#8217;t thinking because he&#8217;d just plowed his garden that day and he was building him a fish pond and he was really getting into planting flowers.   Allen had spent a lot of years in prison. God, my heart, I was in prison. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m saying, there was a lot of hard things to remember that you won&#8217;t forget. But he got out and he was doing good. He was going to be fine. When he called me from prison and told me he got saved, I said, &#8220;Lord, if everything I&#8217;ve been through led up to this, then it was worth it all.&#8221; Because the last talk we had sitting on my porch, he told me, he said, &#8220;Mama, you know you done everything you know how to do.&#8221; And he said, "If I hadn&#8217;t been in prison,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I probably would have been killed or I would have killed somebody.&#8221; Because he got on drugs. But he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve learned a lot. I&#8217;ve learned a lot.&#8221; He was old enough. He was a grown man. He was growing up. He&#8217;d done the stupid stuff. Now everything was supposed to be fine and then just all of a sudden. But that&#8217;s life. You can&#8217;t question it. Things happen.  JW: And he had children?  GR: He had a boy and a girl, Sarah and Casey. Sarah&#8217;s got three little girls now, but never got to see either one of them. But you know, a lot of people&#8217;s lost children. It ain&#8217;t just me. I&#8217;m not all pitiful. People&#8217;s lost their only child. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve suffered more than anybody, but I&#8217;m just saying everybody does it different. It just never goes away. Now let&#8217;s get on something else.   JW: We can pause for a minute if you'd like.  GR: No, I&#8217;m fine.  JW: Okay. Have you always been a religious person?  GR: I have in my own way. See, to me, religion is different for every person ever. I don&#8217;t go to church. I used to go all the time. I don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t feel like you have to. I think it&#8217;s a good thing. It&#8217;s a good thing to go socialize and to worship together, but it ain&#8217;t anything you have to do because probably a lot of them are doing it for the wrong reason and I&#8217;m too old to do anything fake because I don&#8217;t care what you think about me. It&#8217;s what I think about me and what God knows about me.   But as far as me, yes, even when I was little, I always knowed there was a God. And I was like first grade, we all had to walk to school and they started saying, &#8220;Look out for that dog.&#8221; Well, I didn&#8217;t know what dog they was talking about and this big boxer bulldog comes out and I don&#8217;t know why he weaved through other people, but it grabbed me. It grabbed my leg and was shaking me like a ragdoll and then it went to my other leg and it was just tearing, just eating me up. It kept wanting to rear up on me and bite me in my face and luckily, I had a school book and I kept putting that book in front of its face and it had bit both of my arms. My arms was bleeding and I kept holding that school book to where it couldn&#8217;t.   And a voice in my head told me so plain, and we never had TV, so it wasn&#8217;t nothing I could have ever seen, but something told me in my head, &#8220;Do not turn around and run.&#8221; It explained it to me: &#8220;If you turn around and head, if it hits you in the back, if it pushes you down to the ground, it&#8217;ll kill you.&#8221; And I was little, and I obeyed the voice in my head and I just kept backing up until I got to a little, I don&#8217;t know how many feet it was, but to a little store. And the woman run out and got the dog. After she got the dog off of me, I, of course, started just jerking and was crying and I looked down. Both of my shoes was full of blood. It was slushing out of my shoes.   But I'll never forget that voice. I will never forget that. I knew what it meant. It explained it to me: &#8220;Don&#8217;t.&#8221; And now I&#8217;ve grown to understand. A big heavy dog, if it had got me down, it would have killed me. So that was, to me, my guardian angel and just through life, things has always happened to make me know. I personally know, I don&#8217;t guess, I personally know and I don&#8217;t believe in pushing it on nobody else. I don&#8217;t believe in a religion of fear. I don&#8217;t believe in me saying, &#8220;You are to do this and that and that.&#8221; I think everybody has to make a certain amount of mistakes. You got to grow. You got to learn. And when it happens, when you believe whenever or whatever reason, it needs to be the real thing between just you and whatever you might believe. I believe in all religions. I believe God&#8217;s everywhere and that&#8217;s my piece.   JW: When did you and Richard move to Bumpass Cove?  GR: Well, when we first got married, his mom and daddy lived down on the river and we stayed there. I&#8217;m trying to remember which one of the younguns was little. Well, I guess I had Angie, Allen, and Pam because Pam was little and we didn&#8217;t have a bathroom. We had water that run up in the yard from a spring, and I guess it was gravity-fed and the spigot just run all the time. Pam was just little and I couldn&#8217;t keep her out of that water. And I had to wash with my hands. She was the prettiest little thing. God, she was just about two or three, black hair, and her cheeks was always red and her eyes are black as chocolate. She played in that mud and I said, &#8220;Pam, if you get dirty anymore, I&#8217;m going to wear you out and I mean it.&#8221; Because I had to wash with my hands. I washed all the time with my hands.   One time, she got all dirty and stuff, muddy and wet, and I started in the house and she was little and they heard me coming and it scared her to death because she knowed I was just going to bust her butt. And she had her little arms crossed like this and she was trying to get that shirt off and she couldn&#8217;t get it off because the way she had her arms and she was pulling at it. My kids didn&#8217;t cuss or if they did, they didn&#8217;t around me, and I heard her say, &#8220;Goddamn it, Angie, help me.&#8221; (laughs) She was so afraid. I turned around and went back out in the yard because there was no way I was going to say anything. It was the funniest thing. (laughs) So I just went back out in the yard, and I stayed and I let her go ahead and change and hide that shirt. (laughs) And she probably don&#8217;t even remember that.   I don&#8217;t remember what year it was. Teresa wasn&#8217;t born there. Teresa was born in &#8217;74. So she wasn&#8217;t there.  JW: Can you describe the landscape and what it looks like?  GR: It was beautiful at that time. Living in Bumpass Cove was a beautiful place. That road just winds up that mountain. I hope you get to go. Like you go by the river and it just winds and then the road forks and you make a right and it just goes up in that mountain. You look around here at all these mountains. It&#8217;s beautiful and going up through there, there was few houses and most of them was company houses. Some were houses that people had built, but they were nice. They were small and everybody&#8217;s yard was well kept and they had flowers and clean. There was no trash everywhere. It was hard times, but neighbors was neighbors. Neighbors helped each other out. Neighbors visited. Everybody did go to church. All the women would get out and pick berries and they knew which greens to pick in the springtime and they&#8217;d show me.   It was just a nice place to live until the landfill started and that was the saddest thing about that because when that--. People was living up in there and they loved living there, not a better place to be. And it was an innocent place and then when that company come in and started talking about putting that landfill in, there was no suspicion. Why would you be suspicious? We never thought in a million years, never dealt with nothing. So it was as innocent and of course, everybody, they give Richard a job. He was driving a truck. Dorothy Wilson, Mary Lee&#8217;s sister, was a secretary. There was just different people that got jobs in that and was really happy to have them.   So the trucks had to come right through (36:47). When you go over there, you will see how close the houses are. There&#8217;s more houses now than was, but still, but the trucks had to come through there and Hobart Story, my brother-in-law then, lived right beside the road. And Hobart wasn&#8217;t more educated than anybody, but he was older and he just had a wisdom about him or maybe, I don&#8217;t know what gave him that feeling to just start being suspicious of these trucks. Maybe he just had more time on his hands to sit on a porch and look at them, pay attention to them. He started noticing they was coming in just odd hours to be regular garbage trucks because they said all it was going to be was just household garbage. That&#8217;s all it was licensed for. And Hobart started saying, &#8220;I think they&#8217;re taking stuff in there they shouldn&#8217;t take.&#8221; But Hobart had a drinking problem and a lot of people: &#8220;Aw, just don&#8217;t pay no attention to Hobart.&#8221; But he didn&#8217;t quit, though. He just kept saying, &#8220;Something ain&#8217;t right and the smells coming off of some of them trucks,&#8221; he&#8217;d say, &#8220;Makes me sick.&#8221; And then he noticed a lot of trucks would go by with tarps and he started trying to pay attention to what he could see on the barrels and he started nosing around in the mountain. He was the one, he has all the credit of being the first one to wise up to it. I don&#8217;t know how long he tried to talk to people.   Then when that flood come, because see, in Bumpass Cove, the creek comes down through there and it comes through the end part of that landfill and the runoff from that landfill goes into that creek and that whole river coming down through here could be clear. And if it rained really hard and come down through Bumpass Cove and that creek and it goes into the river, from that point on, it would just be all muddy and red clay and you could see where it was going into the river. It flooded hard and maybe the good Lord did that too and washed them barrels out and people could see and smell, and then it was like everybody just said, &#8220;This is enough.&#8221; And I can&#8217;t I say I done anything different than anybody else. Hobart really got people to say, &#8220;We got to stop this.&#8221; So the first time that we went and stood in the road, we didn&#8217;t bit more know what was going to happen than I knowed when I got married. We didn&#8217;t know if that was going to be two days long. We didn&#8217;t know that it was going to be maybe that one time. You just do what you got to do because it was like, &#8220;What?&#8221;   Because they was oiling that road down. See, I lived right by the road and my younguns would ride their bicycles or have to walk through that and no suspicions of that crap they was putting on these old dusty gravel roads. And found out later the PCBs and all that stuff that was in all that that we were being exposed to on a daily basis. And just a lot of people was being sick and having headaches and sick to their stomach and things happened. One time, they dropped a barrel off. I have no idea what it was, but we had to drive through it each time going in or out. It ate the pavement and it killed all the vegetation on both sides of the road. And when we drove through it, I&#8217;ll never forget that smell, that smell, and that sweet taste. You tasted it. It would be like down in your throat from breathing it.   And after that, then I was getting sick a lot, just a lot of dizziness, just a lot of I can&#8217;t describe it. And Pam started having these seizures, and Pam was the youngest. She was, like I said, two or three. She would just, the first time I found her was out there in the water, near that water and she was just laying there like--. It scared me to death and I didn&#8217;t know what was wrong with her, but I got her in the house and got me a wet rag and worked with her and stuff. You don&#8217;t know and at that time, we still wasn&#8217;t putting all these things that was happening with that until later. It&#8217;s like, God, there&#8217;s too many stories now when more people started talking.   After that first time stopping them trucks, then we realized there&#8217;s another truck coming or the next day there&#8217;s going to be more. Most of them, they&#8217;d turn around because what could they do? They couldn&#8217;t run over us. It was just all these people and women and children, everybody standing there. After a bit, Hobart put a tent up in his yard there and Hobart had a really pretty yard. Everybody had pretty yards. And I said something about, &#8220;Hobart, God, we&#8217;re wearing your grass out.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I can always grow more grass, but you can&#8217;t grow friends.&#8221; I love that. And then we all just started bringing stuff to eat because now men&#8217;s camping out and at that time, us women just took turns baking biscuits or whatever we could do, just pitching in and run an errand or whatever.   It just come in the one day, the next day, and I guess that&#8217;s how we met people from Highlander. They probably read in the paper of all the stuff that was going on and maybe just offered a workshop. I don&#8217;t know exactly, truthfully. I can&#8217;t remember how that come about, but I do know that we learned things down there that if we&#8217;d have been educated people, we would have known from the beginning, which we didn&#8217;t know our rights in any way. We didn&#8217;t know how to really look things up or how to go about it. I don&#8217;t know about the rest of them, but I frankly had never heard of the Sunshine Law and they never agitated or put us up to anything. All they ever did was just put us with other people and we talked and we worked things out together, people to people. That&#8217;s where it comes from anyway, and we did learn to use that library, plus our own libraries, just put down the chemicals that we saw. We learned how to research them, what the health effects was, and Jesus Christ, it would scare you to death when you&#8217;d read all the things, the health effects of them chemicals. And then there was so many things happening. Like I said, it was so hard. I feel like I&#8217;ve been to war. You almost have like, they talk about how guys that come back from &#8216;Nam and the war have this, what&#8217;s it called, post-stress?  JW: Post-traumatic stress disorder.  GR: Yeah. You almost feel that because we almost went through something that you can&#8217;t describe. It changed me. I was the most innocent. I believed in right and wrong. I believed that there was a right way and a wrong way, and I believed if you voted somebody in to do their job, that&#8217;s what they did. If you had a problem, you reported it to the health department. If they had a problem, they reported it to whoever they--. If you have a problem, you call the law. I never dreamed the law would be there against me. I never dreamed that the law would come and stand against us with guns because all we was doing was blocking the road, stopping these trucks. It was getting to the point to where you don&#8217;t know what to do, but we wasn&#8217;t quitting. We was learning our rights. We was learning that we had the right to go to court.   The group went and after we finally got them to stop, we got them to lower the limit on the bridge that the trucks was crossing and it kind of caused a little problem because the school bus couldn&#8217;t cross it, but they would unload to another school bus. So that stopped them, too. Then they decided to go up across the graveyard-where I was telling you my son&#8217;s buried-and it was just a narrow little gravel road. And now here these big trucks were coming up across the graveyard, and they had to go across the hill. And then there was a creek that didn&#8217;t have a bridge, and when the trucks would go through the creek, the backs of them would scrub where they was so heavy, it was a dip down, and the smells and sometimes them chemicals would slosh out.  Just so many battles that we had to go through, go through, go through. Just it was a daily thing. You&#8217;re trying to take care of your own life. You&#8217;re trying to work. You&#8217;re trying to be there. You&#8217;re trying to take care of your kids. We&#8217;re getting threatened now. Lies start being published in the paper about us, calling us communists [and] we was not. I was never so hurt or offended in my life. I was making Thanksgiving dinner and I was so hurt, I couldn&#8217;t finish. I&#8217;d never wrote anything before, and I kept going and I was just writing down. I was trying to explain what was said and what was the truth. I&#8217;d try to cook a little more and I&#8217;d get so upset, I would just--. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;I am not. I am not. How dare somebody call me that?&#8221; And I&#8217;d go back and I&#8217;d write some more.  And I took it to the group and I said, &#8220;I want to put this in the paper. I want to explain some of this stuff.&#8221; And they was all for it. So I took it over there, and [the local newspaper] wouldn&#8217;t publish what I wrote because they said they&#8217;d have to check with their lawyers because they didn&#8217;t want to stop. It was selling papers like crazy. But we wound up going to court over that, and the judge said we was not communists and the judge said that we did what we did as citizens of the United States. I just wanted that clarified. I wanted that legally clarified that all I was doing, all I personally was doing was just protecting myself and my children like anybody would do, that they had no right to come into a community.   In a way, it&#8217;s almost, I don&#8217;t know, I want to say you feel like you&#8217;ve been raped. I was raped of my childhood. I was raped of my innocence. I was took away from the Garden of Eden. We lived where we chose and wanted to live and all that was destroyed, but not only what was destroyed was how you feel. People say, &#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you move?&#8221; Why should we? And if we moved, how do we know that there wasn&#8217;t already a landfill there? How do we know now that you can trust any elected official? How do you know anything? It&#8217;s like, yeah, I feel like I&#8217;ve been--. I feel like I&#8217;m old as an oak tree.   But that&#8217;s why now people try to get me involved in stuff and I say, &#8220;No, no, I&#8217;ve done my share. I&#8217;ve been there, done that.&#8221; My heart and my soul can&#8217;t take it anymore. When you give your all, that&#8217;s all you have to give. But you now, the landfill is still here. It&#8217;s not forgotten. Well, it is forgotten. You hear nothing now about the environment. I don&#8217;t want Bumpass Cove to be up again in the newspapers and I don&#8217;t want all that, but you hear it from nobody. You hear nothing about the environment now. You hear nothing about the water being polluted. It&#8217;s like it all just faded away because it&#8217;s all about the big buck. It&#8217;s all about you got to have it. You got to have industry. You can&#8217;t stop progress. You can&#8217;t knock jobs. So now it&#8217;s like the environment--. I guess they think that we can live without clean air and we can live without fresh water to drink one day. And that all worries me, but what can you do about it?  JW: Well, so go on back to that first time that you all gathered and stopped the trucks. How did you end up doing that? How did you organize for the people to come and do it?  GR: See, it&#8217;s all family over there pretty much, just friends and family, and just said, &#8220;Enough is enough.&#8221; When you got a flood and it&#8217;s washing out, and then Hobart was already mad and I guess he just told Russell and maybe got Russell mad and maybe he told Richard. I don&#8217;t know how it happened. We just all, if you said you got a problem, we&#8217;re going to be there to help you with it. That&#8217;s what mountain people are. That&#8217;s how it is and this was, finally, it was just--. It felt like an alien thing that was attacking us, it really was, and we just said no. The air was actually killing us, and we just had to do it. It wasn&#8217;t a conscious choice that anybody made the day before. It just happened. However many showed up that day did and however many showed up that night did, and that&#8217;s how it happened. I think sometimes that&#8217;s how most stuff has to happen. It has to affect you personally. It has to either insult you, hurt you, or make you mad for you to do something. You&#8217;ll take and take and take until all of a sudden, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Uh uh. That&#8217;s too much.&#8221; I guess that&#8217;s what happened.   JW: Do you remember the time that the police came?  GR: I remember we was up there at the church and we was standing there with our signs and stuff and the police come and I remember them guns. I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;My God, have mercy. What&#8217;s this about? We&#8217;re not harming anybody. We don&#8217;t have guns on us. We&#8217;re not threatening anybody. We&#8217;re just defending ourselves.&#8221; But we didn&#8217;t back down and we didn&#8217;t shut up and nobody got hurt, thank God. And I&#8217;m sure they was doing their job. They was just being sent out to try to probably stop us or stop something from happening. I don&#8217;t know. I can&#8217;t speak for them. I&#8217;m just saying we went through things that we never dreamed we would have to. And Mary Lee will probably remember a whole lot more than me. I never was good at dates.  JW: So at what point did you start getting more involved in the citizens&#8217; group?  GR: As soon as it was.  JW: You were there from the start?  GR: Oh yeah, yeah, we was all there right from the beginning, and I don&#8217;t even remember who the first officers were or how that went. But yeah, we was. We would get together at the citizens&#8217; group building when we got that building and we would have our meetings. It was a lot of fun. We would bring food and the kids would play together, and we would have music when we could, we would sing, because there has to be some good times and bad times.   Through Highlander, they had mentioned SALT and that&#8217;s Southern Appalachian Leadership Training program and they had offered, I think, Russell and Mary Lee [Russell] a scholarship and I don&#8217;t even know how my name come up. But Frankie-I can&#8217;t remember Frankie&#8217;s last name-come up to interview me. God, I loved her. We talked and Frankie said, &#8220;Well, I need you to write something about yourself.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Who, me? I can&#8217;t write anything about me. Well, really, I&#8217;m nobody. I&#8217;ve never done nothing. There&#8217;s nothing to say about me.&#8221; And Mary Lee said, &#8220;Give me that.&#8221; So she just started writing down all kinds of stuff and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;God.&#8221; So Frankie told at a workshop later, she said when I first interviewed Gail, I was going to say she might be impossible, but after I&#8217;d been to a workshop or two, I guess I just needed somebody to believe in me or confidence.   Then I got to be a SALT fellow. But I remember the first time I ever sat in that circle down at Highlander at the first workshop. I was scared to death. My heart was pounding and it was closer to me having to tell my name and who I was and where I was from. When they got to me, I told my name, told where I was from, and then because I really felt, believed what I was talking about, I just started telling them about Bumpass Cove and about how we love living there and what it was like to live there and what had been done to us. And then people started asking me questions and was really interested in what I had to say, and then they&#8217;d start telling their problems and it was like, &#8220;Oh my God. You too? This has happened in your community?&#8221; I felt like, &#8220;Wow. They did want to hear what I had to say. I was somebody.&#8221; (laughs)   But that&#8217;s where I growed up. I really growed up at Highlander. I really feel like that&#8217;s where I learned to be a person and to know that it&#8217;s okay to be who you are, it&#8217;s okay to--. We&#8217;re all different. We&#8217;ve all been through different things in life. We all have different statuses. We all have different educations. But we all have different types of common sense. We all have a different purpose in life, and because you&#8217;re more educated or you dress better, you&#8217;re not a bit better than I am. You might say things in a real sophisticated way, but I might could explain it just like that. So it takes us all to make a world go around, and that&#8217;s the main thing I learned down there because I remember this:  I was at a workshop and it might have been at break time, and I was talking with these women and they made me feel less than. And they didn&#8217;t mean to, but it was just they was more educated and I just felt smaller, I guess. But anyway, I was trying to talk in a way that I don&#8217;t talk and I was trying to say &#8220;isn&#8217;t&#8221; and &#8220;aren&#8217;t&#8221; and trying to and I heard myself and I thought, &#8220;Oh my God, what are you doing? What are you doing?&#8221; And I was ashamed of me and I thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never do that again. If I never do anything, I&#8217;ll be true to myself. I&#8217;ll be who I am because I&#8217;m as good as anybody. I&#8217;m worth as much as anybody. I&#8217;m who God made me to be. I am Tennessee. I am from these mountains. I love it, and I&#8217;ll never be ashamed of me again.&#8221; But I&#8217;m glad I did that. That was the stupidest thing I ever done, but I was just trying to be what I thought I ought to be, present a different person, and it&#8217;s okay to be.   And I remember in a workshop, Jim told me, I said, &#8220;Jim, I don&#8217;t spell good.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Now I can read anything, but I don&#8217;t spell.&#8221; He said, &#8220;That don&#8217;t matter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I want you to write your reports in your words. I want you to tell me what you think, what you saw.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay. I can do that.&#8221; And so that&#8217;s where I learned to, I growed up. I learned to quit looking back and saying, &#8220;If I had the education&#8221; or &#8220;If I&#8217;d have been.&#8221; If I had been, I wouldn&#8217;t be me. I would have been me, but I&#8217;d been different.   JW: Are there other things that you remember doing at those workshops or experiencing there that you felt helped you in this process? Were changing and you were experiencing new things?  GR: Oh Lord, I loved everything about everybody I met down there.  JW: So what are some of the things that you would do in the SALT workshops?  GR: The main thing is us meeting other people from other communities. Some of their things was totally different from ours, but still it was in some ways the same, of being let down, of not being able to depend on the people, the officials, or whoever. But just sharing our problems from state to state or community to community and I remember saying one time, actually even from another country they was talking about chemical and like DDT being banned here, but being sent over there and it breaks your heart because you know now we&#8217;re not just our little community. This is the world. We&#8217;re the people of the world and we have all the same problems and probably have had from the beginning of the time, but now that we&#8217;re getting to talk about it and share it, we&#8217;re all working together and that makes us more dangerous because more voices.   I remember saying this one time, they was telling me and I said, &#8220;Oh my God, you too?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I am so happy. I&#8217;m sorry that you&#8217;re having your problems, but I&#8217;m just so happy that we&#8217;re not the only ones that this is happening too.&#8221; Because that&#8217;s how we felt, like, &#8220;Oh my God, this is--.&#8221; But we found that we wasn&#8217;t. Certain people would come to our workshops that didn't want their name told, like a truck driver that had got rid of chemicals, and they&#8217;d say they knowed the company was doing the wrong thing, but they needed the money and that was their job and talked about pouring chemicals out into a creek or doing different things. It was like there was more and more people wanting to do something about it, but they was like us. They didn&#8217;t know how or what to do and so we was just all learning. It&#8217;s kind of like you learn to walk, you learn to talk, you learn, and we had to learn how to solve our problem.   I don&#8217;t know that I could tell another community now how to solve their problem because their problem would be different from ours. There&#8217;s different and better ways to do now. They could get on a computer and probably learn everything they need to learn, and I don&#8217;t even know how to turn a computer on. Everything has changed. I don&#8217;t know if laws have changed, but I do know people don&#8217;t have to take it. And I do know that companies and officials will get by with anything that they can, that they&#8217;re allowed to. I do know that we--. None of us step up enough and say, &#8220;Hey, you work for us. You work for me. You don&#8217;t work for you. You work for the people, we the people.&#8221; But we don&#8217;t do that. We sit around and we complain and we complain about the gas and we complain and we don&#8217;t do anything. They really need to be reminded big time, but I&#8217;m not doing it either; so I can&#8217;t say.   JW: So how did getting to do the SALT fellowship and getting more involved in those workshops change you personally?  GR: I loved it. Oh I loved it. It made me feel like that was what I was born for. I always felt like there was, I always had this feeling that I was born for a reason. It was an odd, strange feeling.   (break in conversation)
GR: I think we all have a destiny and maybe through my talking, maybe by me feeling like I was less than, that I was nobody, that I was very uneducated, that what I did do, though, made other people go &#8220;wow" and made another person think, &#8220;Well, if she can do that, I can do twice as much.&#8221; If I could just have been a stepping stone for one other woman or two other women, then awesome, I was a stepping stone. I did something. I didn&#8217;t just be born, and I didn&#8217;t just die. Somebody will remember something and that&#8217;s awesome. I&#8217;m very proud of that. Actually, I like who I am now. I really like me.   After Richard, see, we was married twenty-two years and then we got a divorce. We was divorced a couple years, and I married again. I was waitressing making two dollars an hour, raising four kids, and if God didn&#8217;t bless every penny I made, I don&#8217;t know how we made it. I had a house payment then because actually, I had to pay for my own divorce. I had to borrow it from a woman I worked for. I had to pay [Richard] off to leave, and so I had to borrow it on the house. Now I had a house payment, a hundred and fifty eight dollars a month, had a light bill, had four kids to keep in school, feed, and raise, two dollars an hour, and made it. You grow stronger than you ever realize you can. This was after the Bumpass Cove thing.   Then, I hate to say his name, it&#8217;s awful, but I met him down there at the restaurant and he was ten years younger than me and at the time, it didn&#8217;t make no difference. We seemed to be friends, and I thought I loved him and I thought he loved me. In a way, though, he was a maneuvering kind of person. And even though I seemed very strong and I would fight a bear and I would kill you over something that I thought was right, I had never had to defense myself as a human being from somebody that&#8217;s supposed to love me. I&#8217;d never been mentally or physically abused. So I didn&#8217;t know how to deal or fight against that. He was more and more ways cutting me off from everybody, from all my friends, belittling me, and I just went from feeling nobody to really being somebody to somebody now just picking at little things. Little things whittle at you, little cuts.   But anyway, I wound up marrying him. I married him down there at the restaurant where I used to work in their yard and it was beautiful and everything was hunky-dory. I was working all the time, raising my kids. I felt like I was juggling the world with just two hands. As time went on, he kept whittling at me as a person and then he would make fun of how I talked. He would make fun of how I said things. I&#8217;m bad to make expressions or use my hands and he would make faces at me like he was being my mirror.   So I got to where after time, I would quit talking or I would quit laughing because I got ashamed of my laugh. I used to sing a lot and hum and I got ashamed of that. I started getting so inside myself, ashamed of stuff, of me, and it got worse and worse. It got to the point to where I don&#8217;t know why it took twenty years. It took me twenty years to realize that he wasn&#8217;t going to change and that I&#8217;m almost gone. I looked in the mirror one day and I thought, &#8220;God, don&#8217;t nobody know I&#8217;m gone? Don&#8217;t they realize? Don&#8217;t my girls know I&#8217;m gone?&#8221; My soul was gone. My body was there, and I was still working and I was doing everything for everybody else, but Gail was gone. I don&#8217;t know. I guess I don&#8217;t know why human beings take so much before you say, &#8220;Enough is enough.&#8221; Maybe because I was raising grandbabies, and I&#8217;ve always put everything and everybody else ahead of me. And I felt like I had to be there to help my daughters and they was all grown up now and I&#8217;m feeling like finally they can stand on their own and they don&#8217;t have to have me no more.   And I had been put down and belittled and just treated like that just one time too many.   I stood in that kitchen window and I just made my mind up one day. He was always telling me to get out and I just said, &#8220;God, if you&#8217;ll help me do what I know I have to do, this one time I&#8217;m going to get out.&#8221; I used to daydream on renting a storage building and sleeping in it, anything, just trying to escape. I didn&#8217;t want to go stay with nobody because I didn't want them involved in it. I just wanted to take my problems and deal with them myself. But I was over here working in Erwin, and I started back to Johnson City, dreading it, and I got here to Unicoi. Here comes my voice again, my guardian angel. It&#8217;s awesome to me and something in my mind said, &#8220;Go up through Limestone Cove.&#8221; I hadn&#8217;t been up through Limestone Cove in years. I didn&#8217;t know what was up through here, and I passed this trailer and there was a tiny little sign about that big, a little red sign, and I thought, &#8220;I bet that&#8217;s for rent.&#8221; So I turned around and come back and it was right here in the corner and it said &#8220;for sale.&#8221;   Well, I went on back home, and he was a truck driver and he wasn&#8217;t there. I called this little old lady that I worked for because she knowed what I&#8217;d been going through and I told her, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve just got to do something.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve found this trailer and it&#8217;s for sale.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Well, what are you wanting for it?" And I told her. She said, &#8220;Well, go back and look at it and see if they&#8217;ll take less and I&#8217;ll let you have it.&#8221; &#8220;What?&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, I called that woman and she said, &#8220;Oh God, no, it&#8217;s really bad. It&#8217;s bad.&#8221; She said, &#8220;My son&#8217;s living there and it&#8217;s nasty. It&#8217;s bad.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care. I need to see it.&#8221; And so she let me in and man, she wasn&#8217;t lying. It was bad. (laughs) It was bad and the power had been out and he&#8217;d been living here. I&#8217;m like seeing it for what it can be. I told her, I said, &#8220;I want it if you&#8217;ll take a certain amount.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And so that was on Monday and I met her on Thursday and the old lady said, &#8220;Give me the money on Thursday,&#8221; and I met her and I bought this place very cheap. I went to the courthouse and we changed titles, and it&#8217;s mine now and all I have left to my name was two hundred dollars.   So he comes home and he starts running that mouth right off and I&#8217;m going, &#8220;Fine. I&#8217;m leaving.&#8221; I already had my--. I cleaned that house. I separated just enough for me, and I left him the best of everything, the best dishes, the best of everything, and I took what we really didn&#8217;t use out of the cabinets. And I cleaned because I didn&#8217;t want nobody to talk about me. Ain&#8217;t that crazy? I wanted my house to be spotless when I left. I left food in the refrigerator. I went and bought a new pack of roast beef and a new gallon of milk and a loaf of bread. I had the refrigerator was full of everything, and I wanted it so that he couldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;She&#8217;d done this&#8221; or &#8220;She&#8217;d done that.&#8221; I left just like I was expecting company, and I packed up the worst of the furniture and had it in the basement by the back door. He started in and I said, &#8220;Fine. I&#8217;m leaving.&#8221; &#8220;Where the heck do you think you&#8217;re going?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I bought me a place.&#8221; &#8220;You what?&#8221; (laughs) He didn&#8217;t believe that it could happen and I&#8217;m going, &#8220;Yes, I did and I&#8217;m gone and you are never, nobody is ever going to treat me like that again because you know what? I am somebody.&#8221;   And I went and rented me a U-Haul truck, and I loaded my stuff in that truck and I come here that first night, never drove one of them big trucks before. And [the trailer] was so nasty and it was dark and there were so many rats that they was knocking these vents up, and me and my cat and my dog was scared to death. And I went and raised up the back of that truck, I thought maybe there&#8217;s a place I could sleep in there, and my dishes fell out and broke and I just wanted to sit down there in the driveway and cry. But I thought, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll deal with that tomorrow.&#8221; And I sat a lawn chair up, and I tucked a blanket under my feet and around my legs and the cat was on one side and the dog was on the other side. And I tucked it all around us and over my head and they&#8217;re looking at me. That was my first night here.   The second night, I had to put paint cans on them vents. Honest to God, I&#8217;m not lying, there was rats as big as squirrels. I started getting up all the trash and cleaning, cleaning, cleaning, and taking it down here to the dump and got rat poison and put it out and just kept cleaning. It took no time and I started building a privacy fence in the back for my cat and my dog because they had to have a good spot, and I built a fish pond. I&#8217;m doing all this at the same time and planting flowers because everybody now started giving me flowers because they&#8217;re so happy I&#8217;m free. It&#8217;s like the first time I went and I painted that bathroom pink, the worst pink. You&#8217;ve seen around the bathtub how I done it flirty like?  JW: It&#8217;s beautiful.   GR: (laughs) I thought, &#8220;I am doing this because I can. I can paint any color I want to paint.&#8221; And I done this because see this light? It was all smoked up where the lady smoked and I cleaned it until I couldn&#8217;t clean it good. So I decided I&#8217;ll paint a sun on it. It&#8217;s like a sunset thing when the light&#8217;s on, and I will because I can. And I thought, &#8220;How cool is this to be sixty years old and finally run away and finally be free for the first time ever in my life?&#8221; I was never a teenager. I was never young. I&#8217;ve been a mama my whole life. I&#8217;ve been somebody&#8217;s wife. I&#8217;ve been something to everybody, but I have never been to me, never. When I first moved in this, I was back to square one. I could not have wrote you one page about me. I could have told you about Angie. I could have told you about Pam. I could have told you about Teresa, everything about my grandbabies, but I couldn&#8217;t have told you one thing that I like. I couldn&#8217;t have told you one movie I wanted to watch, one book I wanted to read. There was no me.   But after I got moved in here, it was all about me. (laughs) It was like, I can eat when I please. I can get up when I please. I can dance all night, and I&#8217;ll sing as loud as I damn well please and I&#8217;ll thank you, Jesus. This might just be an old trailer, but it&#8217;s mine and now I&#8217;ve got it fixed up and it&#8217;s homey and it&#8217;s got sparkly lights and color and anybody that comes is welcome and there&#8217;s no fussing here. And I did have wrote up here: &#8220;Mi casa es su casa,&#8221; which I still have it on my fan on my stove. That&#8217;s how I choose: peace and quiet and happy the rest of my life.  But it&#8217;s amazing the things that you get into that you don&#8217;t realize. He wasn&#8217;t a totally bad person, but when I first met him, I saw all the good and I didn&#8217;t see, I didn&#8217;t see. And two, why would anybody want to be mean to me? I felt like you had to do something bad to somebody to make somebody want to be mean to you. And how somebody can say they love you? I&#8217;m one that I&#8217;ll make every excuse in the world for you, but why would you say that to me? What did I do? All of a sudden, see, I had to have done something to have made you. But I&#8217;ve learned. So no wonder I feel like an old tree. (laughs) It&#8217;s like, God, I&#8217;ve been to hell and back. I&#8217;ve been through a lot of wars, and that&#8217;s why I said I feel like sometimes I&#8217;ve got that stress thing. It&#8217;s like, God, now all I want to do now is just--. I want just life, I want to live, I want to love.  JW: So what do you do now for fun? What do you love to do?  GR: Well, actually, I met the most wonderful person on this earth. He&#8217;s sixty-six and I&#8217;m sixty-four. I&#8217;ll be sixty-four in September. He&#8217;s been through a lot of things in life. He&#8217;d had to raise his kids by himself. He&#8217;s a carpenter. He&#8217;s done his thing and growed up. He&#8217;s got a cabin up in Slag Pond, and he&#8217;s got a cabin down here in town. And we met at bluegrass. I love bluegrass. I love to dance and anybody that ever seen me at Highlander knows I love to dance because they always made me dance. We started out just being friends, and he liked me. He didn&#8217;t say he loved me. He just liked me like me and you, and he listened to me and he liked hearing me talk. He&#8217;d tell me stories and make me laugh on a daily basis. I told him when I really knowed I was beginning to care about him, I said, &#8220;I need to be liked. I&#8217;ve been told I was loved and I was treated that anybody deserves to be, but I want to be liked. I want somebody to enjoy being with me or I want to be alone. I am strong enough now that I don&#8217;t need nobody. I'm not a needy person. I need me, and I need me to be strong. I need me to be at peace.&#8221;   And he understood and God bless his heart, he heard me talk so much for so long. For the first year, all I done was talk and cry and he just listened and he never said one time, &#8220;If I was you, I&#8217;d--&#8221; or &#8220;You ought to.&#8221; He never done that. He just listened until I got strong, until I realized I&#8217;m safe now. I&#8217;m really safe now and that&#8217;s all past, but, boy, did I learn from it. But he likes me and we&#8217;ve been together, well, it&#8217;s been four years now. It&#8217;ll be four years in June. God, well, actually we was on cable country on TV a couple weeks ago. They filmed it down there a year or so ago of us dancing and they keep using that like a little commercial that you ought to go down to Thompson&#8217;s to listen to bluegrass.   Anything we do, it&#8217;s fun together now, if we&#8217;re working in the garden or--. He didn&#8217;t have any flowers when I first went up on the mountain where he lives and I said, &#8220;I love flowers.&#8221; So the next time I went back, he&#8217;d dug me up a flowerbed, had it all fixed. The one time I had took some flowers, bulbs and things that needed holes dug and planted, which I planned on doing, and when I went back, he already had them planted. He&#8217;s like that. It&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t have to hint or ask. If there&#8217;s anything he can think of that just pleases me, he does it because he likes me.   He treats me how everybody should treat each other. That&#8217;s how we treat each other with respect. Respect is everything, between parents, children, anybody, respect. But I told him, I said, &#8220;If something happened for whatever reason that we never seen each other again, I could never have nothing but the ultimate respect for somebody that just let me grow up, let me heal.&#8221; That&#8217;s all I needed. I told him, I said, &#8220;There&#8217;s that song out, &#8216;A Soft Place to Fall.&#8217;&#8221; That&#8217;s what he give me is a soft place to fall and a place to just learn that it&#8217;s okay to be me. And I don&#8217;t try to change him. He&#8217;s just a mountain man. I don&#8217;t say, &#8220;Wipe your boots&#8221; or &#8220;You are too--.&#8221; None of that. He&#8217;s a grown man. He knows what to do. I don&#8217;t need to tell. I don&#8217;t want to ever be nobody&#8217;s boss. I don&#8217;t want to be no more mama. I&#8217;m a grownup now and I&#8217;m loving it. I am probably the happiest old woman (laughs) that you&#8217;ve ever met.
JW: Let&#8217;s see. After you got involved with the citizens&#8217; group and you were working on getting the landfill shut down, did you start to think about other things that were happening in the community?
GR: Well, we was more involved in the school. We went to some workshops. We learned about Title I, the different things in school that I really hadn&#8217;t ever been involved in because I really never felt like I knew enough. We met a lot of teachers that would come to workshops that told us a lot of things, told us a lot of needs they needed in school. They needed more parent participation and so that was good. We started, that&#8217;s education. It&#8217;s amazing. The education I got through them workshops, through other people, was probably more than I would ever have got if I&#8217;d have went on to college because college is all about learning and however you learn, you learn. So yeah and after you start learning, you never want to quit. That&#8217;s the fun part of it is after you start learning, you can&#8217;t go back to being stupid again, but you can&#8217;t go back to being naive either. Sometimes that was the safe place, being naive and trusting. That was a good place, but I guess everybody&#8217;s got to grow up and get in the real world sooner or later. I just don&#8217;t like the way we had to do it.
JW: Can you describe when the red baiting started, how you learned that people were starting to spread rumors about you?
GR: It was in the newspaper.
JW: And that&#8217;s how you learned about it?
GR: Yeah, and I really don&#8217;t want to drag up any of this stuff because I don&#8217;t want it starting to be talked about or republished. I really don&#8217;t want to drag up none of that again because it&#8217;s all settled. But this person, he was a part of our group at one time and I don&#8217;t know what made him change. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know what come about. I don&#8217;t know if it was, in anything. There always gets to be jealousy. Everybody wants to be the top dog. Well, he usually was the one that was in front of the camera and talked and stuff and he was a better speaker and we kind of didn&#8217;t know how to distribute different jobs. It was just who was better at what. I can&#8217;t say that he was bought off, but could have been. Like I said, when you don&#8217;t know what to expect, how they work they work against you. And I&#8217;m talking &#8220;they&#8221; would be the side you&#8217;re fighting, the lawyers or whoever you&#8217;re against, will know how to get in and work on the weakest link. Some people will take money and some won&#8217;t or turn against you.   That was what was a surprise was this person was the one that started all of a sudden saying stuff. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m sure the paper was called or they wouldn&#8217;t have knowed to come out and to interview him, but it started being put in the Johnson City papers saying all kinds of stuff and saying that we was trying to close down other industries and it was just lies. But see, after we got over the first mad and then scared and then it was like, &#8220;Oh my God, why and how and what do we do?&#8221; You realize this is a trick. You can&#8217;t fight this if you&#8217;re fighting that. Well, after you realize what they&#8217;re doing, then you just quit worrying. That don&#8217;t matter. You keep fighting the main thing, the main thing was the landfill, and doing what we was doing. But that still was hurting me. It was hurting my heart that anybody would say that or think that.   And I knowed Highlander had been accused and we was being accused because we had been affiliated with Highlander, but Highlander does not push nothing. I have never in my life, and I&#8217;d swear, ever met anybody that ever even said they was or talked about communism. That&#8217;s stupid. I don&#8217;t care. If you are, that ain&#8217;t none of my business. Don&#8217;t tell me about it. That&#8217;s like your religion or your sex. That&#8217;s none of my business. But nobody ever did, so why would we even think that way? And they never pushed nothing on us or nothing. They just helped us really get educated. They never even said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s how you are to do it.&#8221; Never. They just let us get educated and then it&#8217;s like you do with it what you will. Myles [Horton] said, &#8220;You plant a seed.&#8221; He just meant a seed of knowledge, that&#8217;s all he meant, and then however it grows, it grows, and that&#8217;s what we did. We just, we took. They offered it. We could have not have went. We could have not learned nothing. It was just according to us, and I really hated them getting a bad rap over it, but they was using that to try to cause us problems because they thought, &#8220;Now if we throw this in there, they&#8217;ll get to fighting this and they won&#8217;t be fighting that.&#8221;   And that&#8217;s why I wanted to go to court. First the court didn&#8217;t want to hear it and the judge kept saying why it couldn&#8217;t be in that court and all that stuff and he didn&#8217;t want to hear it. But our lawyer kept arguing why they should hear it. Well, they put Mary Lee on the stand and they talked to her some and she just answered the questions and whatever. And then they got me on the stand and right off, that lawyer started making fun of me, of something I had said about my lack of education. Well, when he done that, he didn&#8217;t know I had growed up. I had changed. I just give him a look. I just turned around like he didn&#8217;t even matter to me no more.   I turned to the judge. I just started talking to the judge and I just told the judge what it was like, what had been done to us, and that Highlander as far as I was concerned was just a building with a library and it had taught us things that we should have already known as citizens of the United States or if we had been educated. If we&#8217;d have been educated, we probably wouldn&#8217;t have been picked on. They would never have put a landfill up in that Bumpass Cove if they&#8217;d have been somebody important or official that lived up in there. They snuck in on us. That&#8217;s how it happened. And I just started telling him what it was like to live somewhere with people that was your family or your friends that you was afraid to let your children out of your sight. You was afraid to let them go to the grocery store, that even you didn&#8217;t feel welcome to go to church anymore. And I just told the judge how it was. Well, I just kept talking. Tears are just jumping out of my eyes because I was believing what I was saying, and I was telling the truth. Everybody sitting out in the courtroom was crying because it was real with us. It wasn&#8217;t something we was doing for publicity. It wasn&#8217;t fun. It wasn&#8217;t nothing you would choose.   And the judge finally, after I got done, he let me talk until I ran out, and he went, &#8220;Whew.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If I could undo what has been done,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I could pay out of my own pocket and undo what&#8217;s been done, I would,&#8221; he said, &#8220;But I can&#8217;t.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a shame that all this has happened.&#8221; But then he ruled that we wasn&#8217;t, that we hadn&#8217;t been, that we did what we had a right to do as citizens of the United States, and that this had better not happen no more as far as being slandered on paper or any other way. That settled it as far as I was concerned because I didn&#8217;t want in the future my children to ever be blamed for anything that I ever got involved in and that, as far as I was concerned, fixed that. And as far as the person that did all that stuff and said that stuff, it&#8217;s all been forgived because he lived in that neighborhood and families mix and mingle, and you can&#8217;t keep living like that. That would have kept a feud going that none of us actually deliberately started and that was just a human mistake on his part and that&#8217;s all forgived and forgot. But like I said, the landfill is still there.  JW: But did he ever apologize to you?  GR: No. I remember the first time I ever really talked to him wa--Angie got hurt at school and he come. He was with the rescue squad, and I was just really grateful. He come, he checked her out really good. He&#8217;d done everything and we just kind of like, that day, just like--. You let stuff go. You can&#8217;t go back and change anything; you can&#8217;t. You can wish your life away wishing. And the past is the past and you learn from it or you don&#8217;t. You just go forward and you do the best you can do.  JW: Were there other threats besides those charges?  GR: Oh, just that one time that we got call saying that we&#8217;d better move out or we was going to be burned out. That was just people from this other industry thinking that they was going to be, that we was threatening them, which that was a part of the lie. They realized in time that we didn&#8217;t really do, say that. After they realized that we wasn&#8217;t doing nothing, we didn&#8217;t have the power to do nothing to nobody else, we wasn&#8217;t going around picking on any other industries saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re polluting a river,&#8221; and all this and that. We wasn&#8217;t trying to. We was just trying to stop this one. You can&#8217;t fight a bunch of fights. You stick to your one little thing. But that was just they was being used too. It was like somebody was stirring up a bunch of stuff and we knew who it was. It was the chemicals, the Waste Resources, or whoever it was at the time.   JW: When the EPA sent people here to visit, I read somewhere that an African American official was with EPA.   GR: I don&#8217;t remember that.  JW: Okay. It was in Dick Couto&#8217;s book. Do you remember him?  GR: I remember Dick, but yeah, I don&#8217;t remember that part.   JW: Okay.  GR: What did he say?  JW: That there was controversy in the community because an African American was in a position of authority.  GR: Oh really? That&#8217;s a shame. I wouldn&#8217;t think the community would be that way because, no, no.   JW: And it may just have been one person who experienced it.  GR: If there was, it might have been because they just didn&#8217;t clash as two human beings, but no, there would be no prejudice, no, no, not from anybody I know. I mean really and truly, that would shock me because over there, I don&#8217;t even live over there anymore, but it was a really good place. Almost any stranger would be welcome to the door. But I guess maybe they&#8217;re like me now. Maybe they&#8217;re more cynical, but it just pays to be now in this day and time. But I&#8217;m glad you brought that up, but no, not anything that I would know of.  JW: Okay. I&#8217;m wondering if you and Mary Lee and some other women in the community were getting more involved in maybe becoming leaders, people who were getting attention who maybe hadn&#8217;t before. How did people respond to that? You were also challenging the ways that men and women were normally acting or relating?  GR: Well, that was the neat thing about it is back then, maybe it was just Richard never treated me like, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re stupid because you&#8217;re a woman.&#8221; It was like, &#8220;Yeah, go ahead if you can do this or you can do that.&#8221; That was the way it was with us. There was a lot of women in the group, and it seems like as it went on, I guess men had to get back to work or whatever happened, but it was less and less men and more and more women at the very end. But there was never no problem between men, like, &#8220;Let me do that. I&#8217;m smarter than you,&#8221; or anything like that, or nobody ever saying, &#8220;Who are you? Why are you doing that?&#8221; Most of the time, everybody was just glad whoever was doing what they did and everybody was really pleased when they got the landfill shut down.   But everybody had to get back to life. After a while, you don&#8217;t want to jump on anybody else. We kind of did scatter out just a little bit and go to other communities and other workshops, but after a while, you&#8217;ve just had it. It's like we can just do so much. We&#8217;re people and we got a life and you got to work and you got things you got to do. You&#8217;re having your own problems with your own kids and before you know it, then you&#8217;re just really wanting it all to just go away.   JW: Well, before you got to that point, what was it like to be in the documentary and to participate in the filming?  GR: I loved that. I was really surprised because Lucy [Massie Phenix] did so much filming. We never had any idea how it was going to come out, how she was going to cut it up or do it. I loved them parts of where we was sitting at the table talking, and I loved that part where the boys was standing at the river talking and the real emotions from children. That&#8217;s as real as you can get and they was so mad, and they&#8217;re grown men now. What I&#8217;m saying, that&#8217;s a pride. We didn&#8217;t ask for that, but I&#8217;m so happy we stood up and we did what we did. I wouldn&#8217;t change that [for] nothing in the world, nothing we done. I love everybody I ever met. I&#8217;ve learned so much.   Sometimes I&#8217;d come back from a workshop, and I&#8217;d feel like I&#8217;d been around the world. I&#8217;d feel so sad in my heart, it hurt, because you hear of problems everywhere and you learn all this stuff. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh my God, I didn&#8217;t know. I did not know the things was going on.&#8221; But it was awesome too to know that maybe some things we did or said helped them. Definitely some things they did or said helped us. We would sing down there at the workshops because you have to have a little bit of pleasure. You can&#8217;t just have all pain. You can&#8217;t deal with that. You would just burn out so bad because--. But we got to where we looked forward to going to workshops because now we&#8217;d made the best of friends that I ever had in my life down there and they was everywhere.   And I remember one time, Dick Couto called me. I was at home and it had probably been a few years after all that stuff and we talked about a bit. He asked me could he call me back. He wanted his class to talk to me if that was alright and I said, &#8220;Well, sure.&#8221; I was a nervous wreck the next day, thinking, &#8220;Oh God.&#8221; He had fixed up, I guess, three-way caller. I don&#8217;t know how he had it, but anyway, they called me at a certain time. He asked me a little bit and we just got to talking about it and talking. The kids asked me a few questions and I answered them. He said, &#8220;You have had their attention the best for this past thirty minutes,&#8221; or however long it was, &#8220;than I have this whole year.&#8221; And I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s really neat.&#8221; Because they&#8217;d been watching the film and that&#8217;s a wonderful thing of that film is they&#8217;ve learned a lot through it. I think it&#8217;s awesome to even have been one of the people that went in this film all the way back to civil rights. Jesus Christ, me of all people to be a part of things changing in history, that&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s like I was filled of this feeling that I had that there was a destiny, that that was a part. Anything a part that I played, I didn't do on purpose, but I&#8217;m really glad I had the opportunity to do.   JW: Did you see yourself as part of a civil rights struggle?  GR: See, when all that was going on, I never had prejudice, never, because when we lived in Indiana-was it Indiana or Pennsylvania? It might have been Pennsylvania. We lived in this little bitty house, but it was a rural neighborhood that&#8217;s just a bunch of houses, a real, tight, little neighborhood. And I remember the first time getting on the bus, and I remember these little black girls got on the bus and I have never seen such beautiful, anything as pretty in my life. And I was little, I might have been a year older than them because they was, the prettiest dresses, oh, these hair bows. I loved them, I loved them, and I was playing like right away. We was just the best of buddies from the first day we ever met and at school, I remember getting shoved down and called a name and I couldn&#8217;t understand why that that kid would call me a name. He called me an n-lover. I don&#8217;t even want to say it.   Why in the world would they do that? Because I just didn&#8217;t see no difference. We wasn&#8217;t raised to be prejudiced and right now, my grandbaby that is my heart, her dad&#8217;s black, and Pam and Anthony&#8217;s not together anymore and I was really mad at him for a while, but it was because of him not being good to my daughter. It wasn&#8217;t because of him being black. I love him. I told Pam, I said, &#8220;There&#8217;s times I hate him as a man,&#8221; but I told Pam, I said, &#8220;I have to love him. When I look at her, I see the little Anthony and I love him because I love her. She is my heart.&#8221; How can anybody be prejudiced? I just don&#8217;t understand. I do not understand. We are a rainbow. God made us all. God made all my flowers out here. Why would I want to whole flower garden with just that purple? Would I take away that pink or take away that red? Uh uh, no.   JW: Do you remember learning about the civil rights movement as it was occurring? Were you aware of stuff that was going on?  GR: Yeah, I remember like in the 60s, I had been, like I said, over to High Point, North Carolina, with my sister and when all that was really happening and there was a lot of fighting in the street because they went to the movies and when they come back out, the front of the movie theater was broke up and stuff, but they got back home. But we shortly moved back to Tennessee. But right in this area, it was like it never happened because nothing was going on around where we lived and like I said, times was hard and you didn&#8217;t go far and you just lived where you lived.   JW: But you had seen stuff happening in North Carolina?  GR: Just that little bit, but never a real lot, never during nothing. I really didn&#8217;t understand what all that was about, just what little bit you did hear on the news, and then you really didn&#8217;t hear that much more about it at the time. We just skipped somehow. I guess these mountains protected us from a lot of things, but we just wasn&#8217;t involved in none of that.  JW: Did you learn more about it at Highlander?  GR: At Highlander, but still there wasn&#8217;t a lot of prejudice talked about. You knew it happened, but all these people had moved on. And we learned about Rosa Parks and all and that was awesome, her standing up, but she was to that point of, &#8220;No, no, no. I&#8217;m not going to the back.&#8221; She didn&#8217;t know what she was going to cause. She didn&#8217;t dream. I think it&#8217;s your time. Either you step up and you do it or you don&#8217;t. We all got a purpose and that was her purpose. But no, I&#8217;ve met a lot of good friends down there. Ed Cabel, I love Ed. I don&#8217;t even know. I&#8217;ve not heard from him in a long time. I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s okay or not. I need to call and find out.  JW: So who have been your heroes?  GR: My heroes? I don&#8217;t know that I actually even had any heroes. I just really learned to admire and respect more people that I did meet at Highlander because they was so highly educated, really, truly professors and highly educated people, and learned that highly educated people don&#8217;t have to treat people bad and that they realize that everybody has value and they knowed how to get that value out of each person. And they didn&#8217;t choose man over woman or whoever. They plowed the ground and planted the seed and either it grew or it didn&#8217;t and either you had the desire, you had a problem, you had the desire to learn and to fix it or you didn&#8217;t. Nobody made you do anything. You just did what you did, but you just felt safe. You felt loved. You felt worth, self-worth. Down there, I remember the first time I sang. I never thought I could sing, but I did and I loved it and it was the best feeling to just have that freedom of friendship to sit in that round room and to sing and just be a part of. That&#8217;s the main thing that I learned is that the whole world&#8217;s not bad and it&#8217;s not all black and white and it&#8217;s not good and evil. It&#8217;s everything and life&#8217;s a choice.  JW: Do you remember your favorite songs that you sang there?  GR: I always loved when Guy and Candie would sing, "We&#8217;re going to,&#8221; oh man. The one that I would sing down there was--. There was a song wrote for us for Bumpass Cove by two medical students from Vanderbilt that come in and helped do a health fair. It was, &#8220;We&#8217;re Afraid for the Children.&#8221; And then there was two students from ETSU when I worked at the restaurant wrote another song and my name was then Gail Story and the name of it was, &#8220;Gail&#8217;s Story.&#8221; (laughs) But just all the [songs] Guy and Candie used to sing all the civil rights songs and just standing in that circle and looking around that circle at all the people after all the stories. God, one girl was there from the coal mines. We really traveled the world. You felt like you&#8217;d been around the world when you&#8217;ve listened to all them stories. But she had this song she wrote about her dad and talked about the dark, that he left in the morning in the dark and he worked in the dark and he got home after dark. Oh Lord, you was there. You was him going down that mine. We was just all crying when it was over and I thought, oh, but it&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s awesome to have shared them kind of things with other people. But Lord, I wouldn&#8217;t change nothing, none of that.   JW: What was it like going to Italy?  GR: Oh I loved that. (laughs)  JW: Was that your first time out of the country?  GR: Yeah, oh yeah. I was with Guy and Candie and Sue [Thrasher] and Ed. I was really surprised. Rome, I thought was different, but how awesome to me that was to stand in the coliseum and to realize that that&#8217;s where the Christians was fed to the lions and think I&#8217;m really standing here, just the whole experience of it. But it was kind of sad to come back home and not have anybody to share it with that really cared because it didn&#8217;t seem like my family cared. That&#8217;s odd, though, for there to be six brothers and sisters, and they was never involved in anything and they never seemed to care anything about what I was doing or never really wanted to hear my stories. So they did not really want to, so I never said, &#8220;Listen to me.&#8221;   And that was kind of sad. It&#8217;s kind of sad to come back with pictures. Like with me and Mary Lee, we had each other or her sister, Dorothy, or that group, but what I already knew they knew, too. So it wasn&#8217;t like getting to tell somebody else, &#8220;Look.&#8221; And you kind of felt like maybe you was bragging or saying, but I didn&#8217;t want it to be that way. It was just like, &#8220;But I&#8217;ve experienced something. I&#8217;ve been to the mountain.&#8221; That&#8217;s how I felt. It&#8217;s like I have been to the mountain. I have learned these things. But that used to really bother me, but it don&#8217;t anymore because they&#8217;re still stuck where I was. They never--. Life&#8217;s just always flowed hunky-dory. I&#8217;ve just always been a wild child that&#8217;s seen things different and maybe that&#8217;s good and maybe that&#8217;s not.  JW: Can you describe your relationship with Mary Lee?  GR: Oh we&#8217;ve been friends. Lord, we met, Richard was Russell&#8217;s uncle. Russell is Mary Lee&#8217;s husband. So my husband was his uncle and they got married, I think, I don&#8217;t remember if they got married first or we did. But anyway, it was all within a few months, I believe, and we was all just young together. I think Mary Lee might be a little bit older than me. (laughs) But we went through a lot of our rough times together. Me and her raised our kids together, shared our food together. She still smokes, shame on her. I don&#8217;t, but we both did when we was young, and we&#8217;d share a cigarette. Times was hard and we would buy Pall Mall&#8217;s because they was longer and we&#8217;d break them in half. (laughs) A lot of good times together and then a lot of hard times, but then Mary Lee had her daughter got killed and that was terrible, terrible. She told me, she said, &#8220;Gail, you don&#8217;t know. You just don&#8217;t know.&#8221; She said, &#8220;It changes you.&#8221; And I never wanted to know and then after Allen died, I learned. I know now what she went through. So yeah, me and her has been through a lot. Don&#8217;t want to do it again. Don&#8217;t know if my heart could take any more, but you never know what you may have to take. So don&#8217;t ever say, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t going to&#8221; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8221; or &#8220;I won&#8217;t.&#8221;   But yeah, we&#8217;ve always been friends, but not to where we got to stay together. We can go a year and not see each other and we start catching up in just a few minutes. That&#8217;s how friends are. I&#8217;m not a possessive person. Sometimes I&#8217;m a very personal person. I&#8217;m a loner in lots of ways, and she&#8217;s always had her kids and Russell around and her family right around her there. But I really am, I&#8217;m a private person. I think I&#8217;m really guarding more on my private now than ever. That&#8217;s odd how that happens. But I like going out to eat by myself. I like going anywhere. I like going to dance because somebody is going to ask me to dance. (laughs) I mean any stranger is just somebody&#8217;s friend I ain&#8217;t met yet. I love people and I love watching people, which I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d ever do. We&#8217;re different. We&#8217;re so different. Mary Lee, she&#8217;s just different than me. I&#8217;m the wild child, and she might be more than me and I don&#8217;t even know about it. (laughs) But we never did get out and run around together or do anything because we was just young mamas together. It might have been a whole lot different if we had been young together, but we was young and married, and when you&#8217;re married, you&#8217;re married.   JW: Did you ever rely on one another?  GR: Oh Lord, yeah, because Richard would go off. Now Russell was more upstanding and worked on a job, but he would be gone all day and Mary Lee would have a car if I didn&#8217;t. She&#8217;d come get me and we&#8217;d go to town and places. Here we&#8217;d have my three kids and her three kids and us very young. Somebody would whistle or flirt at us and we&#8217;d just laugh and think, &#8220;They don&#8217;t know these are all our kids.&#8221; (laughs) And whoever was driving was who got to make the kids mind because there wasn&#8217;t seat belts in cars then or if there was, nobody didn&#8217;t use them and we&#8217;d smack whichever one was hanging out the window. And it was a lot of fun. We always made fun of it. It was hard times, but when you&#8217;re young, you just do what you got to do and you don&#8217;t worry about what you don&#8217;t have.   But her mom and dad, I loved Roxie and John Wilson, and there was times probably me and Allen would have starved to death if it hadn&#8217;t been for Roxie and John. They&#8217;d come get me and Allen and they&#8217;d take Mary Lee and her kids. They&#8217;d take us to Erwin and go get a hamburger. Lord, that was a treat. That was the only time we ever got a hamburger or we got ice cream. They was very involved. Roxie and John was very involved and deserves a whole lot more credit than they&#8217;ve ever got.  JW: In the citizens&#8217; group?  GR: Yeah, very, very much. And there was so many people that was involved that really never got a lot of credit that should have. It used to make me feel bad that they just think some of us because it really wasn&#8217;t just a few. It was a group thing. But like I said, Roxie and John, they was just always there and always doing whatever needed to be done.   JW: Are there other people who stand out to you, who you thought were really important for that group? Every person is important-  GR: Oh absolutely.  JW: To make the group, but are there other people that stand out?  GR: Well, Linda and Jerry Walls was always very, very involved, and there was way more at the beginning than there was at the end. But I guess what was really neat about Roxie and John was that they was older and John had a heart problem, smothering problem, and he was just always there and he was at everything. When we done our fundraiser, John loved to dance and every time, if there&#8217;s music, I was going to dance. John would get up there and he&#8217;d just dance a little bit, just, but he had to because he loved it so much. And he would have been so disappointed if I didn&#8217;t, but he had to join me. And I think somewhere Mary Lee had a film of the old fundraiser that we did over at Lamar School and it just has her daddy&#8217;s feet dancing with me. That&#8217;s awesome. They done what they could do. At a time like that, you give what part of you you have to give, if it&#8217;s just being there or being at a meeting or running errands or whatever it was. But I just remember every time, they was always there, whatever was going on. If it was putting on a big meal or whatever it was or keeping people, keeping students from Vanderbilt when they had the health fair, anything, Roxie and John did. So I remember them the most. You need to talk to Mary Lee about her mom and dad. They was awesome.  JW: I think that I might get to meet Roxie.  GR: Roxie&#8217;s still alive.  JW: I think she might come down.   GR: That&#8217;s neat.  JW: But she&#8217;s pretty old.  GR: Well, she&#8217;s really older now, but you need to.  JW: But I&#8217;m going to at least get to meet her.  GR: You need to take some pictures of her.   JW: Yeah.  GR: I&#8217;ve got to get over and visit her. It&#8217;s been too long.   JW: So another thing I was thinking about is how the women's movement is really developing in the [19]70s and [19]80s nationally and I wonder if you ever saw yourself as part of the women&#8217;s movement?  GR: No, truthfully, no, no. We was just living and doing what we done. No, I didn&#8217;t. I really wish. I didn&#8217;t have time. I really didn&#8217;t. When you&#8217;re doing so much already and you&#8217;re just trying to live, you don&#8217;t have time to go hunt for other things. Even if it&#8217;d been something I&#8217;d wanted to have done, I couldn&#8217;t have. But no, there&#8217;s a lot of things that&#8217;s passed by that I would have if I had had a choice. If I could live my life over and had a choice, I&#8217;d have been right in the middle of everything, but I can&#8217;t. I just done all I could do.  JW: Do you think that you being active in those years was influential on your children, especially your daughters?  GR: I don&#8217;t think so. I don&#8217;t think they remember that much about it, truthfully. Angie might a little bit more than the rest. I took them with me everywhere I went, but they was playing, and I really tried to keep them playing. I didn&#8217;t want them to know how scary it was and I didn't want--. They never seen me really get upset, or they never really seen me cry. I didn&#8217;t want them to know, but there was times when I was scared to death, but I didn&#8217;t want them to know. But now I hope they remember going to Highlander, but I don&#8217;t know if they remember a whole lot about it. Angie, she&#8217;s the one that wrote the poem because that was the worst of times when she did that. I was really proud of her because that said what she was feeling and thinking at the time. But I don&#8217;t know if they understood the full extent of it. And when I did get to go to New York that time with Guy and Candie to Pete Seeger&#8217;s-what&#8217;s it called? That festival that they have.   JW: Oh was it a music festival?  GR: Yeah, and it&#8217;s where there was a landfill at one time, an environmental thing.  JW: Was it at Love Canal?  GR: No, it was--. I&#8217;ve got the book in there, but anyway, Teresa got to go with us and I don&#8217;t think she remembers that much about it. She said she remembers playing in the van. Just when you&#8217;re a child, unless something is really dramatic, you don&#8217;t pay no attention.  JW: Let&#8217;s see. I think those are all the questions I have. Well, I guess one other thing is what was it like to meet other women like Helen Lewis or Sue Thresher or Becky Simpson?  GR: Well, like I said, at first, at first, you&#8217;re really self-conscious at first. Or I can&#8217;t speak for Mary Lee or anything, she may not have did, but I was just really self-conscious and insecure because I hadn&#8217;t been nowhere, done anything. I really, lack of education bothered me. And then after I got down there and I realized that education didn&#8217;t have nothing to do with anything. I wasn&#8217;t there for that purpose and nobody ever made me feel like it didn&#8217;t make any difference. So I just made friends right away with Sue and fell in love with Guy and Candie the first time I ever met them and just was treated, they had that way, but it wasn&#8217;t just me.   It was anybody that ever stepped foot in that building was important and was added in. And it was like if you started with this little bowl of soup and you found out you had more company coming, so you opened another can of corn and everybody was just adding in and that bowl just got bigger. And you felt that warm, fuzzy feeling and you felt at home and you felt loved and you felt like you&#8217;re not alone. You want to learn everything you can learn from everybody down there and the women, I loved them and they helped me grow more than they&#8217;ll ever know as a person. I probably know more now than I knowed then because now I can look back on it and think, &#8220;Oh, if it hadn&#8217;t have been for so and so.&#8221;   I count myself fortunate that I got to meet all these people. To be a part of that, I would not trade it for nothing, for a fortune, I wouldn&#8217;t, because it&#8217;s been a hell of a ride. It really has. It&#8217;s been wonderful. But my best memories and the best friends was at Highlander and my education. Like I told that judge, I said, &#8220;Yes, sir, I did and I took them up on it and I went and I was lucky enough to get the SALT grant, and I got a stipend for it, but I would have done it for free.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;And if somebody is to ever offer me an opportunity to go to college or go, I will go, yes. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about.&#8221;   At one time, I felt like I should have kept going, that these people give all their time and all this stuff to teach me these things, and I didn&#8217;t keep going or doing things with it that I maybe should have done. But like I said, real life has a way. You&#8217;ve got to take care of your own family. You&#8217;ve got sometimes to dig in your own row in your garden. You got a job you got to do and you got to do what you do, and I was helping my daughters with raising babies and like I said, Pam had that car wreck and broke her back. She had a little boy and everything was just going on at the time. I was just juggling more balls than I could hold. Then as more time went, I was really getting out of it. I was in this bad marriage that was just trying to cover me like a black shadow, just trying to destroy me. Now I&#8217;m fighting something that I don&#8217;t even know how to deal with and it&#8217;s like after then all them years has gone by, it&#8217;s like now I&#8217;m on the other side and I&#8217;m okay. I&#8217;m really okay and I&#8217;m really happy now, but I don&#8217;t want to be involved in nothing else. I would go to a workshop at the drop of a hat. I would go to especially a music workshop if they&#8217;d call and say they want me to come. I&#8217;ll go dance. I&#8217;ll go sing. I&#8217;ll do anything like that. But my nerves, I&#8217;m fragile right now. I am as fragile as a crystal vase. I feel like if you&#8217;d drop me, I would break in a million pieces. My job now is to just take care of me. Is that selfish?  JW: I don&#8217;t think so.  GR: (laughs) I hope not.  JW: You gave a lot.  GR: I hope not. I really hope not. But that&#8217;s just the God&#8217;s honest truth.   JW: And your story keeps-  (break in conversation)
GR: [Sometime I feel like I&#8217;m] on a leaf that&#8217;s in the river and these times that I&#8217;m just, I'm laying back and I&#8217;m enjoying the sunshine and I&#8217;m just floating and the water&#8217;s just all smooth and the trees and everything&#8217;s beautiful and all of a sudden, oh God, here&#8217;s the shoals and now you&#8217;re just being throwed from side to side and it&#8217;s awful and you&#8217;re scared and you think you&#8217;re going to die. And then you&#8217;re holding on for dear life and then all of a sudden, the water&#8217;s all smooth again and &#8220;whew.&#8221; I remember when Allen died and I was just trying to hold it together. This man told me, he said, &#8220;Gail, sometimes you just have to swim a little harder.&#8221; Nobody could have said anything better to me and during them times when it was bad, I would say, &#8220;I am swimming as hard as I can,&#8221; and I feel like I got to the other side and that&#8217;s awesome. That&#8217;s awesome. But you know we&#8217;re all going to go through things in life. We all are. I thought I was tough, and I found out maybe I need to learn it&#8217;s okay to be human. Nobody has to be super strong and everybody--. Everybody is weak and everybody should be allowed to be weak. I used to think I was too tough to let anybody see me cry and now sometimes I can&#8217;t stop (laughs), but that&#8217;s okay too because it&#8217;s okay to be me. And to everybody that remembers me, hello. (laughs)
JW: Oh I will. Was there anything else that you want to add or anything else you want to reflect on?
GR: Oh Lord. We&#8217;ve done already been around the world, girl. I just enjoyed it all and I&#8217;m thankful for it all. The only bad thing about it was the landfill. Sorry about that, God, don&#8217;t wish that on nobody and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s worse things happening now than then. But I&#8217;m glad I got to be a part of it.
JW: Well, thank you for sharing your story.
GR: Well, you&#8217;re very welcome. I&#8217;m glad to meet you.
