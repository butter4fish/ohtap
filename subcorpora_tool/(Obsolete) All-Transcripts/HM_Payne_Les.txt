Story_ID: 350710
Speaker 1: So, we're gonna start with your, your place of birth.  You were born in 1941 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was born in '41 [1941], Tuscaloosa, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Josephine [Josephine Payne Johnson].
Speaker 1: And your mother's b-, birthdate; do you know that?
Speaker 2: Sure, my mother was born on November 29th, 1919.
Speaker 1: And was she born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama also?
Speaker 2: She was born in a rural area; she was born in Saw-, Sawyerville [Alabama], which is in Greene County [sic.], in a rural area.  Tuscaloosa is a big city; it was like Paris [France] (laughter) in those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, when you say rural, does that mean she grew up on a farm or a plantation, or were they sharecroppers?
Speaker 2: She grew up, she grew up on a sharecropping farm in Sawyerville and, and--actually, it was in Hale County [Alabama]; I said Greene County--it's in Hale County.  And, and she--her parents had been sharecroppers one generation removed from slavery.  Her mother was born in 1882, her father was born in 1880 which is to say my grandparents, and their parents were in slavery.  In fact, they were born in--she, my mother, was born in Hale County, and her grandmother lived with them, and they used to talk to--in the early days, about Ma Fannie [ph.], and Ma Fannie was born in slavery, so I'm that many generations from slavery, but my mother was two generations out of slavery.
Speaker 1: So, what was your mother's parents' names?
Speaker 2: My mother's parents' name were John and Annie Mae--John Payne and Annie Mae [Annie Mae Payne].
Speaker 1: And did--you said that they had themselves been born into slavery, or that their, their great grandparents (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, my grandparents were not.  No, they were born in 1880--
Speaker 1: Eighteen eighties [1880s], after (unclear), '67 [1867]--yeah--
Speaker 2: --so slavery ended 1865, so they were kind of a generation out of slavery.
Story_ID: 350711
Speaker 1: What stories did your mom [Josephine Payne Johnson] relate to you about, stories about Aunt Fannie or Ma Fannie [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I asked her about that shortly be-, you know my family, and most rural families and certainly rural black family, were very secretive, you know, about what went on in those days because they had endured a lot of pain, I found out later and, and when I grew up there, I mean children to be seen and not heard, and so we did not cross-examine our parents much, and they were very secretive, and I suppose because they wanted to protect us but, but information was withheld.  But toward the end of her life, I did sit down with her and tried to get as much information--I remember things over the years; I was very attentive as a child, and I used to hear stories, and they used to talk about Ma Fannie, Ma Fannie, Ma Fannie, but they never said that she was a slave.  Slavery was a bad word in those days, as black was a bad word; you--we--those were names that were so painful that they were never used.  I never heard my parents or grandparents ever use the word slavery.  They--because it was, I found out later, probably imbued with so much pain.  But one day my brother and I many, many, many years later, you know, we talked about Ma Fannie, probably about twenty years ago--ten years ago actually--and, and he said to me, he said, "You know, Ma Fannie was a slave."  And I was a man, you know, of probably forty years old, and he said, "You know, Ma Fannie was a slave."  It had never occurred to me that Ma Fannie was a slave--never, ever, although I knew history, I knew the timeline, but it was something that I had never really thought about my family; I never thought of myself as having descended in any direct way, and it was a part of that--our history that was buried emotionally and, and, and in every other way, and here I was an adult, aware, informed world traveler, with a cosmopolitan outlook, and certainly what I would consider to be an enlightened outlook, and it never really occurred to me to reason that Ma Fannie, a name that I heard a lot growing up in Tuscaloosa [Alabama], was really a slave, and that she was, you know--be linked, you know, to, to, to slavery.
Speaker 1: How did they talk about her?
Speaker 2: They talked about her as being a presence, you know.  I don't remember--you know, I know they said she was very dark, they sai-, complected, as my family is, and they talked about her as being a very strong woman, they talked about her as being very determined, you know; they talked about her as being somewhat resistant, you know, unusually resistant, you know, and, you know, that's--those are the things that I remember about Ma Fannie.
Speaker 1: About Ma Fannie.  Now, were there--Ma Fannie is the only one in the family that you can directly link yourself to--
Speaker 2: That's the only one that I remember being a slave.
Story_ID: 350712
Speaker 1: Now did your mom [Josephine Payne Johnson] ever talk about her own childhood--what was it like for her growing up in rural Alabama?
Speaker 2: She did, yeah.  You know, yeah she had--it was a large family; there were--her parents [Annie Mae Payne and John Payne], my mother's parents, had fourteen children; eight of them survived, seven of them died young, you know, if not in infancy, you know then in pre-birth.  Eight of them survived and so she was one of--she was one of the young ones; she was like third from last--third from youngest, you know, which  makes her way down the line.  But anyway, yeah, she talked about growing up with her brothers and her sisters.  She talked about working, you know, in rural Alabama, in Hale County [Alabama], they talked a lot about the church. I mean my family were Baptists, fundamentalists, and the church was a given, a church was an all-consuming kind of--I mean there was--from my understanding, there was working in the fields.  Cotton, by the way, was in Alabama; they grew up on cotton plantations that were owned by white plantation owners, and by the time my grandparents came along and therefore my mother came along, they were sharecroppers, you know.  They would work a certain part of the land and the owners would take most of it--cheat them, you know, most of the time, you know.  But they had no recourse, you know.  They would, they would go to the store that was the plantation store, and they would buy foodstuff on credit, or whatever they needed, on credit, and then this was charged against them and many of 'em couldn't read or write and--although in my family, my grandmother did--my grandmother was the learned one in the family--Annie.  They call her--we called her Ma Mae, you know; I call her Mom, you know, because I ended up growing up with her.  But any rate, they talked about how the white plantation owners used to cheat them out of money, they talked about working--that's, obviously was hard, but they didn't complain about it being hard, they simply talked about it was like all-consuming.  My grandmother used to talk about having children, picking cotton, hoeing cotton, having children and going back and working the afternoon--having a child in the morning, and working in the afternoon.  I remember her telling stories like that, and I thought they were apocryphal until, you know, it turns out they were, they were in fact true, which is obviously why, you know, many of them, you know, probably, I guess about 50 percent of them--of hers even, you know, did not survive, you know, conditions were rather horrendous.
Story_ID: 350713
Speaker 1: My mother [Josephine Payne Johnson] talked about working in a cafe, she talked about her ambitions, you know, as a, as a, as a young girl.
Speaker 2: Which were (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She went to the tenth grade.  Hm?
Speaker 2: Go ahead. I wanted to know your mother's ambitions, but you were gonna tell me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  She went to the tenth grade in terms of education, but she always wanted to--she wanted to work--she wanted to be independent, she always wanted to--well, she always wanted to own property, but in those days growing up, she wanted to work outside of the house; she did not wanna be a housewife, she did not--her ambition was to, was to make something of her life.  She did not want children; she told us later, you know, that was not her ambition to (unclear) be a housewife and have children.  Her ambition was to--first she wanted to be a singer, you know; she had a voice but not a top-rated voice--sang in a choir, and then she wanted to work in a laun-, she worked in a laundry and then she worked in a cafe when she was young, and that gave her some independence.  It gave her independence because it gave her disposable income, and disposable income was something that was relatively rare, you know, in farm--sharecropping families because you didn't--you never--seldom saw money because what money you earned went on your account, you know, at the general store that, you know, you owed something.  So she wanted to work quite a part, and from the early age she worked.
Story_ID: 350714
Speaker 1: So how did she meet your father?
Speaker 2: We didn't talk a lot about--my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson], my mother was a tough customer; I mean my father--well, there were three children, yeah, I was the youngest of three--it was three of, of us initially, in Alabama--I mean--just gonna have the story--my mother ended up having five children and she re-married later, but there were three of us grew up in our family; there were three boys, you know.  I have two older brothers; I was the youngest of three, and by the time I came along--I have a brother four years older [John Payne] than I, two years older [Joe Payne] than I, and me, and by the time I came along, I remember my father only vaguely; they broke up shortly after I was born, being the third-born, and I remember him only vaguely, (background noise) and I don't know an awful lot about him.
Story_ID: 350715
Speaker 1: So what was your--what do you remember about your childhood in Alabama--you, your si-, your two brothers [John Payne and Joe Payne] and your mother [Josephine Payne Johnson]?  At what point did your mother move away, or did she move away from--to Tuscaloosa [Alabama], to the city from this rural area?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, that was a part of her ambition.  By the time I was--I was born in Tuscaloosa, my older brothers were born in the rural area, you know, in Hale County [Alabama], and I was born in Tuscaloosa, so I was the, the, the city kid, I suppose.  So by the time I was born in 1941, she had moved to Tuscaloosa, and her grandparents--she lived with her grandparents--my grandparents--she lived with her parents [Annie Mae Payne and John Payne].  They had moved to Tuscaloosa, and then she lived with them in a house on 16th Street as I recall, and I do; it's 2707 16th Street--I remember the address.  And so we lived in, in that house together and, and she worked, you know, as as I sa-, you know, she was in her early twenties at that point, and she worked in a laundry; she worked in a dry cleaners, you know.  I guess it was a dry cleaners, but certainly a laundry and--you know, to, to take care of us, and then she began to scout around; from the time we were young she began to scout around.  She had older siblings who had gone, who had gone north.  I mean a whole lot--this was immigration, immigration was the thing, or migration, rather; they wanted to get out of the South; ambitious family wanted to get out of the South because there was no future and there only was--there was racism and apartheid, you know, structure--well, racism what it was called.  But there was making money, making a life, being able to get a job other than being a cook, butler, chauffer, maid, or something that was not achievable and so most ambitious people, including her siblings, went north.  She had an old-, she had older siblings, they had gone to St. Louis [Missouri], they'd gone to Hartford, Connecticut, they'd gone to Saginaw, Michigan, one had gone to Detroit [Michigan], and so what she would do is she would go and visit them and she, turned out later, was scouting places for to one day move and one day bring us, you know, which was a pattern, you know, but it--but apart from it being a pattern, this is the way it happened in my family.  And so she would visit them and, and then, you know, I started school [Twentieth Street Elementary School, Tuscaloosa, Alabama].  I remember starting school.
Story_ID: 350716
Speaker 1: My uncle had go-, was in this--in the [U.S.] military, in World War II [WWII], and on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] he bought a house that paid for--he got a G.I. Bill loan, a government-issued, you know, loan, and built a house in Tuscaloosa [Alabama], and we moved from this little shotgun house to kind of like a double-barrel shotgun house (laughter), but it was a nice house and it was--this was probably in '47 [1947] or '48 [1948], and I started school [Twentieth Street Elementary School, Tuscaloosa, Alabama] at that point, you know.  I had learned to read when I was about three and a half years old.  I had an older cousin whose name is Maddie [ph.]; she was--she's eight years older than I, so I had the two older brothers and an older cousin who lived with us as well, and her mother had similarly gone north, you know, scouting, you know, for places, you know, to, to, to bring her family subsequently, and--so any rate, so we had, we had this family and then I came from a reading family, which was very odd.  My grandfather--when we moved to Tuscaloosa, my grandfather, John [John Payne], who was a minister, he--in addition to being a minister, he worked at--he was a janitor in the Tuscaloosa County Library [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], which is a library that did not allow black folks; we could not go into the library, but he was a janitor.  Black folks could not go into public libraries, although their tax dollars paid for them.  But he was a janitor and he used to bring books home and magazines home, so we had kind of access to reading, you know, by virtue of that.  And my grandmother [Annie Mae Payne] had gone--had attended a college [Alabama Baptist Normal and Theological School of Selma; Selma University], a Baptist college, out in Selma [Alabama] and so she, she was, she was literate; she, she could read and she could write, and she kept records for the school, you know, and for Sunday school and for the church, and so there was a reading tradition.  There were two things that distinguished those early days in, in my family; one, they were very strong, they were pioneering people, they were resistant, they were not--they did not easily accept the situation as it was; it was a kind of a pioneering family, a pioneering family in that sense.  And, and they, they wanted to--they were very strong on education, you know, my grandmother and my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson].  And I learned to read, as I started to say, when I was about three and a half years old, and I learned to read.  My older brother John [John Payne] taught me how to read, and I've kind of--you know, he was like in first or second grade I was learning to read with him, and I taught my younger brother [Joe Payne].  My brother was two years older than I; by the time he was ready to go into the first grade, I taught him how to read because I had learned to read with my older brother, so--and what were we reading?  We were reading--my, my cousin was reading books to us, you know; I guess regular, regular children books at that point.  But reading was something that was highly prized, and we had a grandfather who was a janitor in Tuscaloosa County Library who used to bring magazines and books, so we had stuff to read other than just your normal, you know, newspaper and stuff.
Story_ID: 350717
Speaker 1: What do you remember about 16th Street [Tuscaloosa, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I remember it flooded one time, I remember that it was--they used to call it the Bottom; we used to call it the lumpen bottom; it was peopled by lumpenproletarians, black lumpenproletarians, who were up from the rural areas, who made very little money at that point, who were basically rural people, that's one of the reasons why we wanted to get out of the bottom.  It was in fact at that, the bottom, but my family was--and most of the families were church-going, you know.  Back in those days, you were either--(laughter) as James Baldwin said later, you were either a hoodlum or a priest, there was no in-between; I mean you were just in church all day Sunday or, you know, you were just gambling all night, you know, and, and, and most of the overwhelming number of the people were very, very religious; very, very--most--mainly Baptist certainly in my economic level.  The people who were better off, you know, more working-class; I mean they tended to be Methodist and who--God knows, Episcopalian--I don't even know if they had a Episcopalian church there, but certainly most people were Baptist or Methodist--hard-working and, and we went to church [St. Paul Baptist Church, Tuscaloosa, Alabama] all the time.  You know, my [maternal] grandfather [John Payne] was a minister; I mean we went to church all day Sunday.  I mean we went to--Sunday school was at 9:30, we went to eleven o'clock service, there was an afternoon service, there was BTU at six o'clock--Baptist Training Union at six o'clock, and then there was night service at seven [o'clock].  And we went from probably nine [o'clock] in the morning until nine at night.  On Sunday was church, and then after--as I got older, there was prayer meeting on Wednesday, choir rehearsal on Tuesday.  I mean it was--church was a big, huge part of our life.  It was education; you know, we learned to read, to cite--recite poetry, you know, to participate in plays.  It was, it, it was more than just, you know, reading a Bible and, and, and worshipping; it was all our--it was also our educational institution as well.
Speaker 1: So your grandfather was a janitor and he was the, the preacher.
Speaker 2: He was a preacher, and he had two churches in rural areas and he would have--he would preach at one church and the people--I remember that people would pay him; in some cases they didn't have disposable income, they would pay him like in fruit.  He would conduct like a two-week revival and people would pay him in canned fruits in some cases, or they would pay him in some of the produce that they produced because they didn't have money.  And in some cases, in one of the churches, he did collect money, and I remember I used to count it, you know; he used to bring this money with contributions from the church in this handkerchief that was tied up, and he would put it on the bed and I was the one who counted the money for him.
Story_ID: 350718
Speaker 1: Do you remember any tent revivals?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I, I mean can you comment on them?  I mean I haven't--I mean I'm from the South--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you're the only person I've met that I could even bring up tent revivals to--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah. Well, the, the tent revival--well, we had a lot of hard-core structured churches, and the tent revivals, the Evangelists, were people who would sweep through the South and they were--they would like set up a tent in a field, and it would be there for like two weeks, you know.  Every night they would have a revival, and they were just itinerate preachers, and people would kind of go in, you know; it was, it was, it was entertainment, but then they would go every night, you know, and some of them had a--it was a regular circuit; it was like the Chitlin' Circuit, you know, with musicians, and they would kind of come around.  We, we made--we had our own church but we would also go to, to, to tent revivals--a very, very common thing in the South.
Story_ID: 350719
Speaker 1: And perhaps I should say that, just in terms of my father's influence--my [maternal] grandfather's [John Payne] influence on me; in addition to counting his money, we used to go to his churches and open up for him, you know.  I mean we would open up for him, like he had a church in Vance, Alabama, and Vance is interesting now (laughter) because the Mercedes-Benz, you know, has built a big factory in Vance.  Well, my grandfather had a, a church in Vance, which was nothing but a rural area, you know, in which people from from--black people come from miles around, and he would conduct services every two weeks, and we used to go and--we used to get the water out of a stream, you know; there wasn't a--there was a pump at a stream; we'd just go down, my brother and I, and we would break the ice on the stream and get--it was a bucket; we would get this bucket and fill it up with water, and that was the water for the church--had a dipper, you know--a tin bucket with a dipper, and that's what people would, would use, you know, throughout the services, to drink with.  And again, this was in the '40s [1940s], this was in the late '40s [1940s].  And, you know, we would--it was an automobile; T Model Ford [Ford Model T] was the car that--my grandfather didn't drive, but he had a friend of his who was a deacon, you know, who would drive him to this church, and we would stay there all day, thank you very much (laughter).  But just on the church, I, I mean I would say that the church's influence on me quite apart from--and, and the idea was that you would, you would go to church and be a good Christian, that you would get baptized at age twelve usually.  My--at least in my family you, you, you would not be baptized before the age of twelve, you know, consent, and you would know what you were doing.  You were going to mournings.  I was baptized at, you know, the age of eleven or twelve, you know, in Tuscaloosa [Alabama], and that was tradition at that point, but the church was very important for me.  As I said before, it was a place where I learned how to speak publically; it was a place where I learned how to read, how to recite poetry, it was a place how I learned to kind of toy around with singing but was never--I never had much of a voice to sing, and it was also the place, though, that interest--that struck my interest in literature, you know.
Story_ID: 350720
Speaker 1: There was a minister; his name is C.L. Franklin, who is the father of Aretha Franklin.  At that point, Aretha was--Aretha is my age, so she was my age, so she I mean she wasn't Aretha at that point.  But her father was a very well-known evangelist, you know; his name was C.L. Franklin, he had a church [New Bethel Baptist Church] in, in Detroit [Michigan], and they had records--these, these big records, 78 rpm records, and he had--there was big five--50,000 watt television--radio station I used to hear, and he used to preach on this radio on Sunday night.  But what I knew more than that was that he used to have these records that--he would have sermons on these records, and you could get these records--C.L. Franklin sermon, by mail order, and my [maternal] grandfather [John Payne] would get these records by mail order, and I remember he--and when he would buy them, we had a record player, and I was the one who played the records for my grandfather.  He would say to me, "Les [HistoryMaker Les Payne], put on that Franklin record."  And this C.L. Franklin, who is Aretha's father, you know, was a, was an extraordinary minister, quite apart from just preaching.  The thing that struck me then and now is his use of language, his use of metaphor, his use of assembly, you know, he had an extraordinary way of, of bringing the Bible to life and, and I, I, I--if I were a, a betting man, I would say that was the beginning of my attraction to literature quite apart from the reading that, that, that my cousin provided.  But, but, now that you have me talking on that, I mean I'm, I'm struck by how that early beginning is really the beginning, as opposed to what we might think of at--in, in our college days.
Speaker 2: So, are there any--you said you were gonna tell me one other thing, I don't know if you did or not.  You said, but aside from counting the money, your grandfather taught you to--?
Speaker 1: Well, maybe it may have been the Franklin thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean he, he, you know, he certainly had that influence as well.
Story_ID: 350721
Speaker 1: Do you know the point in church where you take the sacraments and you--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, the body of Christ and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --what did they do in those days when you were--like getting the water out of the dipping thi-, out of the, the creek?  What did they use for those symbols of like the body of Christ and the, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah--no, they had, they had, they had communion.
Speaker 1: Communion, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Right.  And, and they--oh, God, we were too young to take it, I mean the children didn't take it; they had, they had, they had grape wine, you know, and they had it, and they would, they would have--in the, in the rural area in Tuscaloosa [Alabama]--let me say in the South, it was a rural area, they would--the communion--they would have saltines that they would break up; this was the body of Christ.  They would break up these saltines and they would have 'em on a plate and they would pass them out, you know, and people would take one; and, and the wine was, was grape wine--no, I'm sorry, it wasn't grape wine, it was grape juice; it was not wine at all, you know, but it was grape juice.
Story_ID: 350722
Speaker 1: So, I'm gonna jump ahead a little bit--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --but to go back just because we're talking about religion, but can you talk about being on the mourners' bench?
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're at age of ten or eleven--or eleven or twelve?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean it was--keep in mind I had older brothers [John Payne and Joe Payne], so I knew what the process was about, but I used to, I used to go to church; I don't know quite how spiritual I consider myself, but what would happen is that there was a reviv-, there was a two-week revival, usually in the summertime, that was preached by a minister who was not in town, he was not your regular minister.  My family was a member of the St. Paul Baptist Church in Tuscaloosa [Alabama], which was right next to Stillman College [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] by the way; it's right up on that--Stillman hill, they used to call it; they called it Stillman hill because Stillman College is there, and it's right next door to Stillman College.  My [maternal] grandfather [John Payne] eventually was assistant pastor there, but--and so the revivals at St. Paul were run by a man named Reverend Jackson [ph.]; he was from Birmingham [Alabama].  He was very huge man, you know, I don't know, 260 to 300 pounds--very, very--he's a very large man.  And since my father was a minister, he would come to our house, and my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson]--my grandmother [Annie Mae Payne] was very religious and, and we were living with our grandparents at that point.  He would come to the house, and while he was--did he--he didn't stay at our house but he would certainly eat--take meals there, you know, during, during the time he ran these conventions--I mean revivals.  And when I became of age, eleven or twelve, I went to the revival and was--the mourners' bench usually was the first bench in the church; and this is the bench that were for sinners, you know, people who had not confessed; not that they had done any great sins, but that they had not been converted, they had not been baptized, and so we would sit there.  And sometime there were older people, but mainly they were younger children--youngsters. And I sat on the mourners' bench during this revival and, and Reverend Jackson, whom I'd known as a family preacher, was, was, was preaching and I was, I was converted.  I mean I had what I felt sure was a conversion; I had--I was--it was like on a Tuesday--I still remember it.  It was like on a Tuesday, and keep in mind that I can--I grew up in a very religious family in which religion was talked all the time, but I had never really experienced anything really personally, you know, and--but you sit up on the mourners' bench, they preach, and they're preaching at you and then at the end of the day, you know, you--some people would go there for years (laughter) and, and not gonna, gonna feel anything, but you had--of your own accord you had to walk and give the minister your hand, and when the, when the minister would preach then, he would open the doors to the church and then would specifically talk to, to the mourners, to mourners on the mourners' bench and invite them to join the church, but you had to make that decision; you would have to get up and walk up and, you know, it was--your parents usually didn't force you to do it, although they were--you knew that they would be happy if you did it.  But I was determined to do it if I felt like it (laughter), you know.
Story_ID: 350723
Speaker 1: I guess I was saying that at age twelve--and the whole idea was that it's free will, that up until then, as I understood it, and remember my understanding of it was that up until that time, you know, your sins that you committed, you know, were not on your own hands, but after that particular age, you know, then you begin to be responsible, and so you have to make a de-, a choice or a decision and--but it had to be a free will choice and have to--you have to accept Christ, you know, as your savior, and that from that point on, you had to kind of dedicate your life, you know, to live a life, you know, that was the way you would take full responsibility, you know, for what were called sins, you know, of whatever they were--Ten Commandments and beyond, and--but beyond that, there was a very spiritual aspect to it, and I actually, on the afternoon of the Tuesday before I had decided I actually did feel what I thought was a kind of a conversion; I mean I felt I can--I didn't see anyone walking by, but I felt, you know, an emotional kind of awakening, you know, that was, was, was--there was no physical manifestations, and then the decision came upon me--the garbage that I had been conditioned one could argue exteriorly, you know, but I had decided that day, you know, that I was going to, if I--if that stayed with me, that I--and then that Tuesday night I, I ended up, you know, joining--you know, taking a step as they call it and, you know, and was subsequently baptized in a place called Southern Dairy [ph.], which was a stream, you know; we--they baptize in a stream, not in a--they were not in a church, but we went to--all the--you know, we put on your white gown and you would go and you would--in water up to here, and then the minister would totally immerse you in this--I remember it being very, very cold, you know, saying, "Man," you know (laughter), "can they pick a better day?"  That water was freezing (laughter), you know.  But anyway, that, that, that was it.
Speaker 2: So--but before we move on, can you--is there anything you can describe about that feeling about the, the spirit--like the emotional feeling that came over you to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it, it was a--it, it was a shiver.  Keep in mind that I'd been well-conditioned; I mean I'd, I'd been in church, I'd spent many, many, many Sundays, you know, in church--many, many sermons, you know.  You know, my gra-, and I suppose it was also, I figured--you know, in retrospect it probably was expected of me but I mean I was kind of--but it, it was--it was a shiver that, you know, convinced me, you know, that something--you know, it, it, it was a shiver, as, as, as much as I recall it, you know, but I mean it convinced me intellectually, you know, that, that this was the time for me to, you know, to, to dedicate my life to some being other than just, you know, my own devices, as it were, and I accepted, you know, all of those precepts that had been taught me, you know, over time.
Story_ID: 350724
Speaker 1: So, moving back now to you starting first grade [at Twentieth Street Elementary School, Tuscaloosa, Alabama]--to starting school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you are, you were able to read already.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what was first grade like in Tuscaloosa [Alabama]?  And I'm assuming it was legally segregated--the school was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, all schools were totally segregated.  We lived on--across the tracks, and we seldom saw white people; only time we saw white people when we went to town, and we used to go to town on Saturdays--cross the tracks and go what was called downtown to shop.  But it terms of school, what was first grade like?  It was boring and it was short in the sense that the first grade teacher began to try to teach the alphabets and it, it dawned--I didn't say, look, I know all of that, but in time it dawned on the teacher, and I think her name was Mrs. Taylor [ph.], as I recall, that I knew all of that, and she--some meeting was held, or whatever, and then I was immediately promoted to the second grade, you know, and said, "This guy can already read," you know, so I was promoted to second grade.  And then when I got in the second grade, it--a discussion was held and they wanted to promote me to the third grade and my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson] said, "No," you know, because I guess, you know, he's too young, I mean here's a guy who's six years old in the third grade with people much bigger and larger, and she, for whatever reason, opposed it, and so I stayed.  And at those days, I should say they didn't have any facilities for, you know, accelerated classes or anything like that, and so I, I was in the second grade, you know, and, and with my teacher--her name was Ms. Easter Jackson [Easter Johnson Jackson]; I still remember her, who was al-, she was also our Sunday school teacher [at St. Paul Baptist Church, Tuscaloosa, Alabama] but--and so from, from, from then on I mean I--it, it was just regular, just regular school.
Story_ID: 350725
Speaker 1: So, from first to sixth grade [at Twentieth Street Elementary School, Tuscaloosa, Alabama], does anything stand out for you as a, a milestone or poignant moment or turning point?
Speaker 2: No, I mean I, I--strangely, I remember all of my teachers; I mean it was formative, formative years for me, you know.  I, I had the reputation of being--there were--during those six years--roughly up and going up to the seventh grade for me--second, third, fourth, or six years that were more-or-less the same class, we had the same teacher.  Not--one teacher taught, you know, all the classes and, and the students were pretty much the same, and I still remember some of them.  And there were three, there were three of us who were considered bright, you know.  One was named Milton Ivory [ph.]--that was a guy, and there was me and there was a girl name Mary Louise Boyd [ph.], and we were considered the bright people in the class, you know, for whatever reason--I guess grades mainly.  And I don't know why I remember those names and I remember that point, but I do remember that, now that you ask.  And, and, you know--that I remember.  And I, and I also remember, at about that time, trying to--I always wanted to be well-rounded; I never wanted to be thought of as an egg-head.  I thought that Milton Ivory, you know, was one-dimensional; I thought that he was--there's no question that he's very bright, but he didn't play baseball well, you know, he didn't shoot marbles well, he didn't--you know, and, and I always warred against him.  He was kind of, what we would call today, generations later, called a nerd and I always warred--I always wanted to be well-rounded, I do remember that.  I always wanted to play, you know, a major--I played sports and, you know, I delivered papers with my brother John [John Payne], and I remember my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson] who, I think, wanted a girl; she had two boys and she wanted a girl when I was born, which is why she named me, and I'll say this for the tape, Leslie, I call myself Les [HistoryMaker Les Payne], which was kind of an ambivalent kind of name--ambiguous name, or--and I remember when I was in sixth grade, she wanted me to learn piano and I resisted that, and I remember (laughter) when it was in the wintertime I, I went to--my, my piano teacher's name was Mrs. Finch [ph.], and I took piano lessons early on, obediently, and then when spring broke, you know--and I used to kind of head for Mrs. Finch's house and then take a sharp left and go play baseball (laughter) and, and come back and, and tell my parents that I had, I had really taken lessons while--and they caught on later on, and I just gave up the piano.  My mother later had her daughter [Mary Payne Glass], but it wasn't me, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 350726
Speaker 1: That's what I remember about school [Twentieth Street Elementary School, Tuscaloosa, Alabama].  And, and we played softball, we swam, by the way.  I mean we, we, we swam in the summertime in, in a place called Swift Creek, where there were cottonmouth moccasins and--
Speaker 2: Is that the same creek you were baptized in?
Speaker 1: No, no, Southern Dairy [ph.] was where we were baptized; Swift Creek was like in the woods, and we'd go down there with snakes and everything, but that's, that's--and we also swam in a place called the gravel pit, which is where they were digging gravel out of--you know, it's a very, very deep place; my brother almost drowned--my older brother almost drowned there in front of my eyes, by the way, which is t-, one of the most terrifying sights I'd ever seen.  My oldest brother John [John Payne] was a very good swimmer at that point.
Speaker 2: How old was he at that time?
Speaker 1: He's four years older; now John must have been--I must have been about eight, he must have been about twelve.  He, he developed early; he was very strong, he was big, broad--he developed early.  I mean we later caught up with him, you know.  But, but he, he, he, he was swimming in the gravel pit and he caught a cramp and, and he went down twice, and I was on the side.  I wanted to jump in, but I couldn't swim at all, and I just remember being on the banks watching him.  He, he, he--you know, he was yelling; he had caught a cramp.  I didn't know what to do, and he, you know, grabbed his leg and went down.  He went down twice, and I'd heard always that if you go down three times that's it--third time you, you--that was it, you would drown.  And when he went down the second time, you know, a guy name Rudolph Ball [ph.] and another--two guys jumped in--two friends of ours jumped in and pulled him out, you know, and I don't think John ever been in water yet (laughter) other than in a bath, you know.  But I mean that was, that was, that was, that was horrible, horrible.  I mean I know stories of people who've lost their sibling but--I mean I almost did and, and I--you know, I remember, I remember the look on his face, you know, all my life, you know, he and I were very close, by the way.  But it, it, it was terrifying.  That was one of those terrifying moments.
Story_ID: 350727
Speaker 1: The other thing I remember about the South is that I saw the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] once when we had moved from--we had moved from 16th Street to 22nd Street, and there was one night around--shortly around dusk, there was this long line of cars, you know, that drove by our neighborhood, and someone said they're the Klan.  They didn't stop or intimidate, but someone said that was the Klan; I mean the adults whispered that it was the Klan.  They didn't tell us, we were children; they didn't tell us anything, you know.  They told--I didn't know what the Klan was at that point, obviously, but I should say that Tuscaloosa [Alabama], you know, has a reputation for being the home of University of Alabama, Crimson Tide [Alabama Crimson Tide].  We knew about them, you know; we used to listen to their football games, you know, on the, on the, on the radio.  There was a guy name Harry Gilmer, I remember him--he was a quarterback.  I mean, you know, we, we listened to the game but we couldn't go to their games; we could not attend their schools, you know, University of Alabama.  But we listened to the Al-, university, Crimson Tide games and, and I also remember Tuscaloosa was also famous--it was the home of Robert Shelton, and Robert Shelton was the head of the Ku Klux Klan, and when you entered Tuscaloosa, there was a sign, you know, it says, "You are now entering Tuscaloosa," and there was a separate sign and, and it says, "Home of Robert Shelton," you know, the grand dragon, or the imperial wizard I guess he was of the, of the Ku Klux Klan.  And I remember I used to see that sign all the time, you know, entering Tuscaloosa.  It wasn't on the, the municipal sign, it was a separate sign that the Klan had put up and it would look very official, and it said it was the home of Robert Shelton, head of the Ku Klux Klan.  So that's that (laughter).  That's the only time I remember seeing the, the Klan, and I found out later that, that we should have been terrified, and a whole lot of years this terror campaign to--they're driving through and they were probably intimidating other families but, you know, I, I never knew what their mission was that particular night.
Story_ID: 350728
Speaker 1: So, when you entered high school, how old were you?  What year was it?
Speaker 2: Okay, at twelve years old--
Speaker 1: Or junior high school, I should say.
Speaker 2: Junior high school--I left, I left Alabama when I was twelve, going on thirteen, and I had completed the eighth grade.  I went to the eighth grade in Tuscaloosa [Alabama], and I completed the eighth grade at twelve, since I was, you know, I got skipped [at Twentieth Street Elementary School, Tuscaloosa, Alabama].  So I finished the eighth grade at twelve, and then my family moved to Hartford, Connecticut; this was in 1954.
Speaker 1: So, did everyone move or just you, your mom [Josephine Payne Johnson] and the siblings?
Speaker 2: My mom and the three of us.  My mother and my three brothers and I.  Now, she had gone before; she had gone before and she had worked--she had, she had been living there.  She used to send us, you know, money and support, and come down, you know, the way immigrant mothers do, whether they're from Jamaica or Europe or Ireland, or whatever; sometimes it's the father who is a, who is a migrant who goes and, you know, whether it's Mexico or whatever, who goes--I mean we were immigrants, you know; we were as much immigrants as the Mexicans are these days or, you know, as the, the Irish were, you know, later at some point, or the Jamaicans were, you know, a few years back when the mother usually would come up and scrub floors, you know, and the go back to Kingston [Jamaica].  Well, my mother went up and sh-, of all the places she went, she, she said--she told the story about Chicago [Illinois]; she didn't like Chicago.  She had a, she had a--her best sibling lived in Chicago; she went there but she said it was too cold, and she told me the story (laughter); she said she had this friend in, in Chicago, and she was freezing, and her friend said, "Oh, this is not even cold; I haven't gotten out my fur coat yet."  My mother said, "I don't have a fur coat so I'm out of here," so she said she's, you know, can't go to Detroit [Michigan].  She didn't like St. Louis [Missouri], she didn't like Detroit, she didn't like West Virginia--all these places are places that she-- she didn't like Saginaw [Michigan] to live.  These were places where she would have brought us, you know, but she did like Hartford, Connecticut, and she liked Hartford, Connecticut because there were a lot of jobs; there was the aerospace [aerospace industry], and it just was open in a way, and one of her older sisters' name was Millie [ph.], who lived there--you know, my Aunt Millie?  And so she went there and lived with Aunt Millie and her husband Steve [ph.], and then she brought us, and this was in 1954, and I had completed the eighth grade, so I started the ninth grade at Hartford [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut].
Story_ID: 350729
Speaker 1: So, when starting the ninth grade, and being 1954 and, you know, Brown versus Board of Ed [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], does, does that mean suddenly you're going to school with white kids that you had not gone to school with before?
Speaker 2: Well, because I was in Hartford [Connecticut].  I mean in Hartford it was already desegregated, but we did not go to school with white kids in Alabama because there was no desegregation in Alabama in '54 [1954]; in fact, it was not until--came later on--'57 [1957], you know, before they--I mean we heard about school being desegregated but it had no effect whatsoever in Tuscaloosa [Alabama]--none, except the newspaper story, you know.  And I know because my brother used to deliver the Tuscaloosa News on a bicycle, and I used to sit on the handlebars and kind of throw them out.  So, I mean I read the newspapers, you know, every day, and I was acquainted with newspapers; I read almost everything I could get my hands on at that point, but Brown had no impact in Tuscaloosa in 1954--zero, zero.  But when we moved to Hartford, Connecticut, yes; Hartford, Connecticut, there were very few blacks--relatively few blacks in Hartford when we moved there.  We moved to 40 Walnut Street which was--turned out to have been the North End of Hartford, and I went to Hartford High [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut]; I was to go to Hartford High.  The first thing I, I experienced is that the Board of Education [Hartford Board of Education] told my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson] that I could not--that I would have to repeat the eighth grade and, and so my mother said, "Why?"  She said, "Well, because it is custom."  They said, "Usually"--she said--there were two reasons that they wanted to put me back.  Number one, they said the schools in the South were inferior--black schools in the South were inferior, and that blacks coming out of the South were not fit, you know, for the high school, so they would put 'em back and let them repeat the eighth grade and then put 'em into high school.  My brothers [John Payne and Joe Payne] didn't have a problem because they were in higher grades, but they wanted to put me back.  And they also wanted to put me back because I was younger, you know; I mean I was younger--I was just twelve years old, you know, going--trying to go into high school, and they said, you know, "You can't be--," you know.  And my mother resisted; my mother said, "No."  She would not allow them to put me back, and she was--I remember her being very stern on this, just as she had fought them moving me--accelerating me to the second grade [at Twentieth Street Elementary School, Tuscaloosa, Alabama]--I mean from the, from the first grade to the second grade; she was equally as firm in--that they--that the white Board of Education in Hartford not put me back to the eighth grade, and so they said, "Well, you have to take a test."  And so they gave me a test and I passed the test officially, so I went into the ninth grade and--so I went in the ninth grade, started the ninth grade in Hartford and it was terrifying.  I mean I went into high school at Hartford High--Hartford Public High School, and in my homeroom class--the teacher's name was Joseph Nathalie--Nathalie, N-A-T-H-A-L-I-E, Joseph Nathalie, and that number was 320--I still remember my--it's a three-story very gothic high school building that has since been torn down for a highway, and they have a new high school (unclear).  But anyway I, I remember sitting in this classroom on the third floor just terrified; it was white, all-white; everyone in my high school classroom was white (unclear), except me of course, and it was very, very strange; I mean I, I was terrified.  I, I, I felt inadequate, I felt unprepared, I felt inferior, I felt--and I absolutely felt this.  And, and, and, you know, it's not so much that they were friendly or unfriendly, I just--it was, it was just absolutely strange; I mean they had--you know, once they had plucked me from a world of 'Our Miss'--from 'Amos 'n' Andy' to 'Our Miss Brooks,' I mean it was just unbelievable.  And it took me quite a while to get adjusted to just being around white kids, you know, in, in a school.  And what it means, obviously, is that the South--my condition in the South had trained me to be--to think that I was inferior; I mean no one ever told me that I was inferior, no one said that--well, they may have told me but no one ever convinced me that I was inferior.  If you had asked me, do you think that blacks are inferior to whites?  I probably would have told you no.  And then ask me, do you think that you're, as a black man, as inferior--or as a black twelve year-old--is inferior to a white?  I probably would have told 'em no.  But, the condition in Alabama--everything about it had, had, had, had emotionally wired me to think that I was inferior, you know, and that--and, and, and I felt inadequate around white kids.
Story_ID: 350730
Speaker 1: So, if you look back as an adult, can you point out an incident in Alabama in which you could characterize as an incident that, as an adult, you see as possibly that would make me--condition me to feel inferior.  Like what conditioning in Alabama--
Speaker 2: That made me feel inferior (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that made you feel inferior?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, sure.  The family conspired with it, even though they were loving, you know; they conspired with it because they didn't want you to get in trouble.  There was always--we were told, particularly as boys; I won't say particularly as boys then but I know as boys.  There were three of us, and we were very precocious and aggressive, and my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson] always used to say that when--I remember her then and later--when people would ask why was she going north, she would tell 'em that she was going to get a job then, but she--I remember this, and I remember it plainly her saying that.  She said, "I don't have the kind of boys that can grow up down here."  And she really felt that we were too precocious and aggressive, and maybe even smart, but she figured that we would--in other words, we would get in trouble, we would not abide, we were too rebellious, we would not abide by the system of apartheid and racism, and we would get in trouble, you know; I don't know, lynched or whatever.  And so that was always that concern in the South, and so there was always a mantra in the house to be nice and to behave and not to break the law, and the laws, you know, were--you couldn't do anything.  And I remember--and I checked this with my mother before she passed.  I, I remember when I was six years old, I was in a shoe store and I refused to say "Sir." Well, no, the first instance was this, and this was when I was definitely six years old as well, about the same time.  But a telegram boy--they used to have telegrams in those days where they was--it was--a delivery boy would give you--would bring it to your house and say, there's a telegram for the Paynes.  And my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Mae Payne] was probably getting a telegram from one of her children up north, and so the, the boy who brought the telegram was white; he was about sixteen years old I would say--maybe he was a teenager; let's say fifteen, sixteen, whatever, and he brought this telegram to my house--my grandmother's house--and my grandmother answered him, "Sir."  And, and I was six years and I, I, I thought that was strange that my grandmother would say, "Sir" to a, you know, a teenager, you know.  Now, the reason I thought it was because--and my grandmother was--we were very much--there was--the etiquette was that you respected your adults, and you really respected your elders, and people who were my grandmother's age were people of--were held in the highest esteem and, and, and she was a pillar of the community and my [maternal] grandfather [John Payne] was a pillar of the community, and we answered them, and here she was saying, "Sir" to a teenager and, and, and it struck me as odd and, and stayed with me all my life and--as to why she answered this guy, "Sir."  And, and, and I found out later because he was white because I know we didn't--she never answered black teenagers, "Sir," you know, by any means, you know (background noise).  And, and then I began to get some kind of awareness.
Story_ID: 350731
Speaker 1: (Background noise) And another incident that stands out is my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson].  I was in a shoe store at about that time, and I refused to say, "Yes, sir," to a--and maybe for that reason f-, I, I won't link them but I know it was about that time, which would say I was about six.  I was buying shoes to go into the first or second grade [at Twentieth Street Elementary School, Tuscaloosa, Alabama] and, and I refused to answer the shoe salesman, "Sir," and my mother slapped me in the shoe store and--you know, to discipline me for not saying, "Sir," and I refused, even with her discipline, and she jerked me out of the store and, and I don't know if I--I don't remember if I got the shoes or not.  But for whatever reason I, I did not answer this, this, this shoe salesman, "Sir," and she was telling me that it would get--that I would get in trouble, you know, for not doing this, and you could get in trouble, you know; I mean people would kill you, I mean white people would kill you for not (unclear), for breaking the etiquette, you know.  This boy was uppity; who is he?  And they would teach you a lesson.  This is the way, you know, Alabama was in those days.  I didn't know at that point, but I did know that, you know, I was not gonna answer this guy, "Sir," and may have been that time because--my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Mae Payne], so--and so things like that began to make me aware that something was wrong here.
Story_ID: 350732
Speaker 1: Our teachers, all of whom were black, would tell us that we were just as good as whites, but I always noticed, too, that I was a reader.  I would notice that the books that we read were--had Tuscaloosa High School [Central High School, Tuscaloosa, Alabama], now Tuscaloosa High School was a white high school not--it wasn't Tuscaloosa High School but it was Tuscaloosa whatever--the county school, it was a white school.  In other words, these were passed down books; the binding would be broken and they would be all tattered and dog-eared, and we were getting books, you know, from the white high school after they had passed 'em down, you know--I, I noticed that.  I didn't make a big political point, but I was aware of this, you know, and we all knew that and we (unclear) probably joked about it without attaching any particular meaning to it.  And then with--now, our teachers would always tell us, "You're just as good as--."  They used to have to say this; they found a need to say this, "You're just as good as white, you're just as--," and we were smart enough--those of us who were smart--Ivory [Milton Ivory (ph.)] and I, and at least Mary Louise Boyd [ph.], would look around and say, "If we're just as good as they are, then why aren't we the mayors?  Why, why can't we be mayors?  Why aren't we doctors?  Why aren't we nurses?  Why can't we go to University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama]?"  You know.  So there was a--the whole experience, you know, was one of massive contradiction and hypocrisy, and our parents kind of conspired and participated in it, and the way it came to us is that they would tell us to be nice; they clearly loved us and they didn't want us to get in trouble.  They would always tell us, "Be nice, don't go, don't go across town, don't go across the railroad track after dark, don't do this, make sure you answer people, 'Yes sir,' make sure you're courteous to white people," you know.  And my brother John [John Payne], who is four years older than I, worked across the tracks; he worked at a, at a, a dry goods store among white people all the time; he was kind of a clerk, you know, kind of a sales clerk, you know--stock boy, I guess you would call 'em nowadays.  And so he was around white people, and they would tell him all the time, said, behave himself when you're around white people, you know, and to condescend to, and to kowtow.  And so all of that kind of--at the end of the day--and, and by the time I was twelve--I mean I would love to say that I was a revolutionary and I was against it, but by the time I was twelve, I was no longer struck by the fact that black people answered white people, "Sir," you know, because I had been conditioned into the system.  And so there were, there were these kinds of things that, that kind of added up, you know, to my conditioning of inferiority and, and--which is what that experience was.  I mean we were conditioned to, to, to, to feel inferior to white people--all white people, no matter, whether you're strangers or knowing 'em and, you know, and, and all black people, you know, were, were, we were conditioned.  That's what that system was.
Story_ID: 350733
Speaker 1: So, when you arrived in Hartford [Connecticut], and you were at a white school [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut] for the--did you--let me--I'm asking you to speak as kind of like a twelve year old, but were the black people that you encountered in Hartford different from the black people you had encountered in the South?  Did your mom [Josephine Payne Johnson] change when she got to Hartford?  Did you see something different in her?
Speaker 2: You know, used to--the talk was different, you know, like I--we used to sp-, I, I spent a summer in Hartford, before I moved there I spent, you know, the summer of '50 [1950] in Hartford, and when I went back to--just a summer, you know, like during the school year, maybe two months, and when I got back to Tuscaloosa [Alabama], they said, "Oh, you talk proper, you talk different, you talk like a northerner."  I mean it was unbelievable, you know; just, just for two months, you know, you said that your whole--the way you spoke was different and, and they called it proper, you know, (unclear).  And so, yeah, there, there, there's no question that there were those differences.  I mean people, you know--they had jobs, they had more money, but your question about my black peers, whether they were different?  Well, we lived in an apartment on Walnut Street [Hartford, Connecticut], and everyone in that apartment, except one old elderly Italian woman, was, was black, was black.  But the people across the street were white, the apartment building across the street from us was white, the one next door was white, the guy who ran the candy store was white, so we had this black apartment building in the middle of a white neighborhood, which never happened in Tuscaloosa.  So, you know, Frankie Scrippo [ph.], who's Italian; I mean I knew him, you know, and so I, I got to know some a these people that I went to school with.  So, conditions were definitely different.  My black peers, some of them were up from the South--most of them were up from the South; most of them, my immediate ones--friends--were up from the South themselves.  They had been, they had been there earlier than I in some cases, but their, their roots were in the South; most of their roots were in the South so they, so they kind of knew what I was going through, and you know, pretty much.
Story_ID: 350734
Speaker 1: But the whites--folks are the ones that was the wild card and, you know--there was a startling thing that happened in Mr. Nathalie's [Joseph Nathalie] class [at Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut] that pointed out, you know, how I felt.  I, I got back a test in geometry, and he was a geometry teacher, Nat--Mr. Nathalie, and I got back a test--and I never will forget this--well, I haven't forgotten it--maybe one day (laughter), if all is done and said, I may forget it (laughter), but I got a 92 [percent] on this te-, geometry test--plain geometry, and the white--and I looked around and the white guy--you know, I was shy, as then and now, and I looked at this white guy who was across from me; he had a 78 [percent].  And I thought that they had mixed up the papers because I was saying how could I possibly, you know, get a grade higher than this white guy here, you know?  That's, that's how--and I remember this, you know, and I didn't share it with a lot of people and I remember this precisely because that's an indication of that you asked the question of how it registered.  I mean there--you know, you know we're aware human beings, you're not (unclear) with treason, and, and it registered.  And I remember for the longest time being struck, you know, that this--and then I began--and we got more papers back and I began to find out, you know, I, I got higher grades than a lot of whites.  And then I began to say, holy cow, you know, these people are not superhuman, you know?  I mean I can get a 90s--I can get in the 90s [percent] in geometry, they can get in the 60s [percent], whatever, you know?  And it was--then I--that was a part of my enlightenment, but it took a while.
Story_ID: 360995
Speaker 1: You were gonna make a summation about, as a black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was--yeah, after, after noticing this and the, the discrepan-, or disparity, you know, in, in the grades between--the grades that I got and this particular white fellow, then I began to notice increasingly that--I mean I was, I was an honor student [at Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut] by the way, and I didn't--straight A student--let me make this clear; I was not a straight A student, I was an honor student because I got some Bs (laughter) and some Cs, but I, I was an honor student, but--and so what I notice is that I--you know, most of my colleagues, my fellow students, were white and, and I was an A student and I was getting, particularly in geometry--97, 98 [percent]; I was very good in math and science, and I noticed that a lot of my colleagues, you know, were, you know, whites, you know with--and then I began to think for the first time that maybe I was not intellectually inferior and I began to ponder it, you know; I mean I had relief.  There's no question.  I mean I would like to say that it was not so, but it was so, that I felt inferior to them intellectually.  I felt that white people were smarter than me, you know, and smarter than us as black people, and--by extension, and I don't know exactly how that happened, but it was cumulative, you know; that's what the whole system in the South was geared to, of course.  And then I thought began individually to say, hey, wait a minute; if I'm getting A's and some of them are getting A's, too, but most of them are getting Bs and Cs, you know?  And so I began to say that, you know, I'm not now--you had mentioned earlier about blacks, and some of the blacks in (laughter)--would ask me--I found out that some--they would ask me, "What did you get on that test?"  I won't even say it, but my brother, too (laughter), my brother jumped up--I--we were in physiology and my brother Joe [Joe Payne] and I had physiology together, and he asked me, he says, "What you get on that test?"  And I would say, "98 [percent]," (laughter), and he never asked me again, he never asked me again (laughter).
Story_ID: 360996
Speaker 1: So I began to realize that whites were not smarter than me individually, and then I began to grapple with the whole idea of inferiority (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How so though?
Speaker 1: Well, at first intellectually; I mean I, I, I suppose I hadn't really thought about it because I'd never really confronted white students before.  I found out that--I began to read a lot on my own, and when we were in classes [at Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut], you know, I wouldn't raise my hand ever; I was afraid to raise my hand.  I mean I'm not a very--I'm basically shy; I'm not an outgoing kind of person, then or now, and I would not be the person, at any rate, to raise my hand (unclear), but even if I had the answer, I wouldn't raise my hand because I never had confidence in the answer because I thought it was wrong, but yet when I would take it, it was right, you know.  We took the test and the written part--it was right, but I never had the confidence in it.  So, I'm not much into introspection, but I did begin to work on my--and I shouldn't say I'm not deeply introspective.  When I was in the South, for instance, I used to--because I was shy, I once made a decision that I would not go through life this way; I would not go through life being shy, you know, that I was gonna do something about this, and so I used to practice speaking in public; I used to stand in front of the mirror.  You know, when I was a child, when I was very young, no one told--I just wanted to do it because I didn't--and I knew I was shy.  I'm going back to the South now because--the reason why I knew I was shy is because everyone said it in the family; like we had cousins who lived in Northport [Alabama].  When they would come to visit us, you know, I would talk, but when we went to visit them, I wouldn't say anything, and then they would say, "Oh, Les [HistoryMaker Les Payne] is shy."  And so that's how I, I knew about the shyness and, and I decided I was gonna do something.  Well, similarly, similarly, I began to do something about this sense of inferiority.
Story_ID: 360997
Speaker 1: You know, I began to read a lot of outside stuff, I began to read books that were not assigned, you know and, and then I began to read--I remember reading, for instance--and I know a lot about so-called black history books 'cause you're watching those guys--the only thing they did teach in the South.  I was not unacquainted with black history.  But I began to read--Herbert Aptheker wrote a book on slavery--it was just a pamphlet; I don't know how it came across me--I just came across it in my reading.  Herbert Aptheker wrote a book on, on, on slave rebellions, and I thought that had been one--the only one I knew about was Nat Turner, you know, and I found out--and he said there were many.  And then I began to say, ah.  I would think so--I would think that no one--no people would accept slavery without fighting it, you know?  'Cause this is what--everything in my family had taught me, you know, to resist, and so then I began to read more and more outside; I mean I, I--the Russian, I began to read the Russian writers, you know; Dostoyevsky [Fyodor Dostoyevsky] was one of my favorite writers and I, I began to--the Russians, and people who were not American--at that point, the Russians were the enemy, by the way--I mean an American.  So, I began to politically--which may not exactly be the word at that age because I certainly didn't consider to be--it being a political thing, but I just began to identify with people who opposed the U.S.  I began to have issues with, with a country that had led us to this position.  And I remember during the Space Race later on that I used to root for the Russians and I used to, used to root for the Rus-, I, I, I loved them; I loved Russian literature then and now, you know.  And the French--I used to read the French writers, Camus [Albert Camus] and Sartre [Jean-Paul Sartre], and I found--I began to find answers in, in foreign writers and foreign thinkers, and in foreign--and particularly those who were critical of America, you know, and, and those who were not critical of America.  Dostoyevsky wasn't critical of America at all; he was just writing, but he wrote in a way--the way the Russian--the way Dostoyevsky explained pain, you know--and Solzhenitsyn [Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn], by the way, and later on--much, much, much later on.  I read Solzhenitsyn much, much later on and had the same feeling reading Solzhenitsyn, you know, in the '70s [1970s] that I had when I was reading Dostoyevsky, you know, in the, in the, in the '60s [1960s], and that is that I thought that the Russian approach to suffering--the Gulag, for instance, that Solzhenitsyn wrote about.  I mean he wrote a, he wrote a book called 'A Life'--'A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich' ['One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,' Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn] you know.  I mean I thought that--when I read that book, that book began to help me understand what it was like for my parents, who suffered in Alabama.  Now, I didn't put it together, but I mean I was just struck emotionally; I was drawn to the Russian writers for reasons I didn't know at the time.  I'm not gonna be--sit here and say I knew, but I just did; I knew that I read them, and I knew that people--my fellow students said, "Why are you reading this stuff?"  You know (laughter)?  And--but I found answers, and I think maybe it, it's the enemy of my enemy, you know, had some less--is, is my friend.  And I remember I used to Rus-, used to root that--when, when the Russians landed [sic. launched] the Sputnik [Sputnik 1], I was cheering; I loved it then, you know, that somebody was getting a leg up on this country that had so oppressed me.  And I remember when the U.S. tried, they had this Cape Canaveral [Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Cape Canaveral, Florida] before it was called Cape--at Cape Canaveral they had this little grapefruit satellite that they're trying to put up and it blew up and I was cheering--my brother; I was, I was so happy, you know?  I was, I was so happy that I wanted someone that was supposed to take the pressure, you know, off of this, this country, and unfortunately it's coming back around now 'cause of super powers.  I mean it's, it's enormous pressure it put on this--put on its citizens, you know, and, and the hypocrisy; but as a student, I began to find answers--getting back to the point, I began to find answers by going outside of the American experience.
Story_ID: 360998
Speaker 1: I didn't find answers in Hemingway [Ernest Hemingway]; I read Hemingway and he didn't have anything to say about blacks--he didn't have anything for me, in Hemingway, although I read him in school.  I read Faulkner [William Faulkner], I read Fitzgerald [F. Scott Fitzgerald]; I read all of the American writers that we were supposed read.  I read (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mark Twain?
Speaker 1: Mark Twain, yeah.
Speaker 2: What did you think about the relationship between Huck [Huckleberry Finn] and Tom [Tom Sawyer]?  Did you have any (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well, I've read, I've read 'Huck' ['The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,' Mark Twain], you know, at various stages of my life, you know, and I think that he's one of the great American--I, I, I accept the notion that it's one of the great American pieces of literature, you know--American.  And I, and I think that, I think that, I think that Twain was making an anti-slavery statement, and that I'm not at all put off by the use of niggers, I think that people misread that, you know.  I think that Mark Twain is one of the great writers ever, and I think he's one of the most preceptive--perceptive writers ever, and I think that a lot of black scholars, you know, seeking to write yet another Ph.D., I think, I think you might be--misread that, you know.  So, you know, I'm a, I'm a big fan of, of, of 'Huck Finn,' you know, and I'm a big fan of Mark Twain, and I'm a big fan of some of his disciples like H.L. Mencken, you know, in journalism.  And I think that, you know--well, not, not to get into a critique, but Mark T-, 'Huck Finn' was not big in my life.  I mean I read 'Tom Sawyer' ['The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,' Mark Twain] first and I, and I, I missed Mark Twain; I didn't think much of Mark Twain.  I mean I knew that Mark Twain lived in Hartford [Connecticut], by the way; he has a big house on Farmington Avenue, you know.  I used to, I used to walk by there every day, you know, just about; certainly when I went to University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut].  But I wasn't into Twain; Twain wasn't one of my influences, you know, until later, and therefore I was beyond influence.  The American writers didn't--you know--if, if anything--I read Thomas Wolfe, you know, and he would talk about--negatively--about--now, I thought he got it wrong; I thought he was a racist dog, you know, and it was in his literature.  And he never really purged himself; he was an rigid anti-Semite as well, Tom Wolfe was--as, as most Americans; most American white writers I thought were racist, you know, when they cared to mention blacks at all, they mention 'em in, in a stereotypical context, except for Mark Twain, who's the only one who grappled with it, you know.  And, and I think that if, you know, if you read, you know, the body of his work, I mean you'll find that he's one of the most perceptive American writers, you know, in, in terms of writing about racial conditions.
Story_ID: 360999
Speaker 1: At this time you're in junior high school [sic.].  I mean, once you're at Hartford [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut], and you're making these good grades, are you having any inclination as, as to what you wanna do with your life as a professional?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When I was in tenth grade, I had a teacher, I think her name was Mrs. Anderson [ph.], and she--I mean, you know, we would--I came back and I wrote about summer camp, you know--how you spent your summer, you know, as every freshman and sophomore did.  And she read it and--and I had made up most of it; it really wasn't how I spent my--I mean I probably scribbled it here and there--(unclear) from here and, and the other place.  But anyway, she was struck by the writing and she told me so, and she said it was a couple of phrases in there.  She said, "You know, you're a pretty good writer."  She communicated it to me--not used quite those words, but she communicated to me that she saw something in my writing that I should pay some attention to; it's the first time any teacher had ever really said that.  And so I began to think about writing and I don't know if she said, "You should think about writing," but I began to think about writing and I began to pay more attention to my writing, and then--and again, having read literature from an early age, I never thought--I never really, at that point, had thought that I could do it, you know.  Although I, I, I, I loved to read, I never figured that I could do it until much, until I read James Baldwin really, and then I began to think, ah, we can do this, you know.  And by the way, I mean I'd read Richard Wright; and Rich-, I mean I read Richard Wright, my cousin read me Richard Wright; I mean I read 'Native Son' [Richard Wright] and 'Scottsboro Boy' [Haywood Patterson and Earl Conrad]--I read those books and had 'em read to me before I--when I was eight, nine, ten years old, and I knew 'Native Son,' you know, not inside and out but I, I was certainly acquainted with Richard Wright, you know, before I left Alabama, you know, so we'll just say before I was twelve.  And, you know, interestingly enough, I also knew Joseph Conrad; I found this out because I went back, and--there are some books that I had when I was a child, with my name all over, and I read Joseph Conrad quite on my own--books that I'd gotten outta the lib--that my [maternal] grandfather [John Payne] probably got from--well, did in fact get Tuscaloosa County Library [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], you know.  I'd read--I mean Joseph Conrad was the writer that took me away from, you know, my immediate setting.  Oh, I later found out that, you know, English was his--I, I think he's one of the great writers in, in the English language and it turns out that English was his second language; you know he's Polish, Joseph Conrad.  He didn't even begin writing English until he was about sixteen years old but I--that's neither here nor there.  What was your question?  (Laughter) That I'm not responding to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, but that's interesting.  Your inclinations to becoming a writer came from this teacher--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so that was--you know--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --Baldwin, you read Baldwin, said Baldwin was--that's when you--it struck you.
Speaker 2: Right.  And then I thought that black people can do this.  Richard Wright didn't do it for me because, even though he was black, he was of another generation, you know, but Baldwin was kind of speaking about New York City [New York, New York] and, you know, Harlem [New York, New York], uptown; he was writing about stuff--contemporary stuff that I understood, and it was accessible to me, and it was inspirational to me.  And what it did, it uncaged a gyroscope--it made me think that A: reading all those white writers, and this is probably a part of my--and I won't say our--this is a part of my conditioned sense of inferiority.  Reading all of those white writers never occurred to me that I could do it; it was only when I read black writers that I began to believe that I could do it, and they began to write about something that was important to me, and that's the way racism works.  See, the--it restricts you, you know, in a way; at least that's the way it worked on me.
Story_ID: 361000
Speaker 1: So anyway, in the tenth grade I began to think about writing, and--but, you know, I--well, let, let me put it this way.  Here's the way it happened.  In the tenth grade I began to think about writing, but in tenth grade I also began to think about what are you gonna do with your career?  And here I was--I guess I had some sense of it, although it wasn't conscious, that my family kind of--they told me later that they did it, and it must have communicated to me that, that I was the smart one, not the chosen one, but I was the guy who--even though I was the youngest of the three boys, I was the one who could make it.  My brother at the--my oldest brother [John Payne] was as smart as I, but he had to work and help our parents take care of us, you know, because we were working class living in a small apartment, hoping to live in a house one day, you know; we were very ambitious, you know.  And my other brother [Joe Payne] was kind of different, you know, wayward; I mean he was, he was quite on the--he went to--his own drummer.  So, I began to think about what I was gonna do, and when the Sputnik [Sputnik 1] went up and the Space Race was launched, I began to think about science and math.  I was good in science and math, also good in English, and Hartford [Connecticut] was a center for aerospace.  Pratt and Whitney [East Hartford, Connecticut] was there, Sikorsky helicopter [Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, Stratford, Connecticut] was there, Hamilton Standard [Hamilton Standard Propeller Corporation; UTC Aerospace Systems]--had a lot of aerospace--heavy-duty aerospace operations in the State of Connecticut.  And so I began to think about engineering, you know.  I heard, heard the word engineering--dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, so I said, ah, engineering is what I wanna do; I'm good at math and science, geometry, and all that stuff.  And I went--this was in the tenth grade, and I went to--my, my guidance counselor was named--man named Carlosen [ph.]--white--all of my teachers were white.  I never had a black teacher, by the way, in high school [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut] after I left Alabama.  After I left Alabama, I don't think I ever had a, a black teacher in high school or college, except maybe a substitute teacher.  In fact--not maybe, but in fact, but--so--my counselor, it was a man named Carlosen.  And so you go to your--in the tenth grade, you go to your guidance counselor and he asks you the question that you just asked me, "What do you wanna do with your life?"  And so by this time I kind of fig-, so I said, "I wanna be an engineer," all right?  And he said to me, he said, "Really?"  And he said, "I don't think you should be an engineer."  And I asked him why.  And he said, "I think you should--," and he really said this.  He said, "I think you should really go into a field where Negroes can get jobs," you know, and he said, "And that's not engineering."  Now, I wish I could say that I had a good, smart retort for him; I wish I could have said to him, "But I'm getting A's in geometry and, you know, and in physiology and physics," and you know, later on I don't think I had physics in--by the tenth grade, but my math and science grades were--I, I was an A student in math and science; not a straight A student, but I was an A student (laughter); I was just (unclear) in the 90s [percent] in math and science.  And yet he was telling me that I should not consider engineering; he told me in plain English, and I had no answer for him, you know.  I mean I, I was stunned, and I told him that I wanted to take courses that would pre-, allow me to go into--to, to, to, to, to be accepted at a college in engineering, and he would not al-, he blocked my being--taking advance math, prep math and, and science courses because he felt that as a, a Negro--back then that's what we were called--that I couldn't get a job, and he said that I should not--and he dissuaded me from doing it and even blocked me from taking courses to do it.  I didn't talk to my folks about it because my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson] had gone to the--only to the tenth grade and she would not have understood these kinds of things; I grappled with this individually, but I didn't--I was not influenced by him.  I was determined now more than ever; this is the kind of person I am.  I was now determined more than ever to go into engineering, you know, even though he said I shouldn't go, even though he would not allow me--he would not, and did not in fact, sign me up for, for honors classes in math and science, which would have prepared me for engineering.  I took--I had to take summer courses.  In fact, when I got out of high school, you know, I, I, I worked a year before I went to college, and I took so-called postgraduate courses in math and science to make up for the classes that I--that had not taken, and I ended up getting accepted to University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut] in their engineering--it had a very good engineering department, by the way, and, and I was accepted in engineering at the University of Connecticut.
Story_ID: 361001
Speaker 1: I hated it (laughter).  I hated engineering, I mean, I hated the students, I hated (laughter)--I--now, the problem was this.  The problem was that--we're, we're, we're now in college, you know; I get accepted to University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you give me a year, though, like the year you graduated high school [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut] and--
Speaker 1: I graduated high school in 1958.
Speaker 2: So '58 [1958], and you take a year off, '59 [1959]--
Speaker 1: I took a year off, right.
Speaker 2: --so 1960--
Speaker 1: I worked, I worked at a dry cleaners, I worked at in tobacco in the summer; I mean I was hustling to get money, too, you know?
Speaker 2: So it's 1960 that you start University of Connecticut?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know.  Nineteen fifty-nine [1959], I--and I, and I applied University of Connecticut and I was accepted, all right?  So I started University of Connecticut in '59 [1959]--'59 [1959]?  Yeah, yeah, because I grad-, yeah.  I graduated '63 [1963], so I was there for four years, so 1959, you know, I start--1959 in the fall I start Uni-, UConn in, in engineering and, and we're taking, you know, calculus and, you know, mechanical engineering and electri-.  These first two years are prep, you know, and then the last two years, you know, you go into your major, whether you're gonna be electrical engineer or mechanical, civic, whatever.  And so--and the--so the first two years are the same in engineering, and when I say that I hated it, I mean it was clear to me that--I mean we had to study all the time; I mean I didn't--it's not that I didn't like the studying so much, it was that there was something about--I mean I knew that this is not what I wanted to do with my life, you know.  Engineering students--we used to go on study dates, and the people in the, in the fine arts and liberal arts--these guys were partying and stuff, and man we were like--Saturday morning we had a study that group of us, team--we were solving this team exercise that we had in physics or whatever, whatever, chemistry or whatever, you know, the course was.  But it wasn't just that, it was like the students who were drawn to engineering, I didn't like them, I didn't get along--I didn't like their vibes from them, they were too loose, they were too tight, you know; they, they were of a type, but during the freshman year, the professor said--which I guess every professor say everywhere, you know, "Look to your left, look to your right," you know, "One of these two students will not be here at the end of the semester," all right?  So I said, "Well, it's not gonna be me."  So I was determined, you know, that I was not gonna flunk out, you know.  At that point, at the University of Connecticut, which has a very fine engineering school, the first semester, I think something like 50 percent of the students flunk out, and then--this is what they said; and then at the second semester, you know, another 25 percent flunk out, and he said that.  He said, "50 percent of you gonna go the first semester, second semester, 25 percent of what's left."  And he said, "And then we will have the engineers for the future."  That's what--I'm gonna make that, you know.  So I made the first year, you know.  I wasn't an A student; I wasn't even an A student in there, but I made it.  I was, I was, I was a, I was a good, solid student but not an A student.
Story_ID: 361002
Speaker 1: And now we're--I'm going into my se-, my sophomore year [at University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut], still an engineering student, and I really, really hate this; I know I can-, this is not something I wanna do with my life.  And my mother's [Josephine Payne Johnson] taking to--talking about her son the engineer.  "Oh, my son's an engineer."  She didn't know what an engineer was, but she was--on her job she was a silk presser in a dry cleaners in Hartford [Connecticut], and so she would say, "Oh, yeah, my son's going to college."  "Yeah?  What is he doing?"  She say, "Well, he's an engineer."  They say, "Engineering?"  So it was very impressive, so she wanted--you know--so my family had high hopes that I was gonna be--I was the first in my family to go to college, by the way, other than my mother who didn't--my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Mae Payne] who didn't finish college [Alabama Baptist Normal and Theological School of Selma; Selma University, Selma, Alabama] but she went.  So, all of this is riding on me and my brothers and everybody they're proud of me, you know, I'm gonna be an engineer, and man I'd say, "Oh, God."  So it was only after my sophomore year that I, I finally took the courage to say, I have to get out of here, I don't wanna do this--I do not want to do this with my life; I wanna write, that's what I wanna do.  I couldn't take any English classes because, you know--with your elective--an engineer with an elective, you know, the only--you only--you had one elective and you really had to take an elective where you could just ace it, you know.  Usually, you would take art or something because the other courses were so challenging and so demanding, you had a full load, and so I cou-, I couldn't take English classes, and so end of my sophomore year I got out of engineering, (unclear), broke my mother's heart, you know, and I found out later my brother's heart as well, but it made me very happy, you know.  I decided that I wanted to get into--I wanted to write, I wanted to write the great American novel--that's the end of my tenth grade teacher's  influence [at Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut].
Story_ID: 361003
Speaker 1: At that point, by the time I was a junior in college, I decided that writing is what I wanted to do with my life, and my generation of writers wanted to write the great American--I didn't wanna go into engineering.  And then, of course, at work--what are you gonna do, you know?  When I told my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson], you know--I remember telling her, you know, I wanted to write, and she said, "Well, what are you gonna do with that?"  And she says, "You gonna teach?"  I said, "No."  I hated teaching, "I don't wanna teach."  I said, "I'm gonna write."  And then--I mean when you think about it, I mean most of the writers back there were people lived at Greenwich Village [New York, New York] or lived off their parents, didn't make any money, you know, so I said, okay, I will either teach or go into the newspaper business.  I figured those are the two options if you wanted to be a writer, you know, while you're waiting to write the great American novel, I would go--either go into the newspaper business and teach.  And then I said--I kind of decided I didn't wanna teach, so I wanted to go into the newspaper business.  And the problem with the newspaper business is that there weren't any blacks in the newspaper business.  I had never really consciously known a black journalist, you know, in daily newspapers.  Now, I used to read the black papers, and they were certainly--in the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] and Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], there were blacks who were writing for those papers, but these were weeklies, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you have a black newspaper in Hartford [Connecticut] also?  Was there a black newspaper?
Speaker 1: No, not at that time, there was not a black--but there was a black paper--there was a black paper in Alabama called the Citizen [Alabama Citizen]; it used to come out of Birmingham [Alabama].  So I was, I was familiar with black newspapers; there were a lot of them.  We used to read 'em all the time.  And there was a different kind of journalism.  I mean it wasn't--it was--some of it was largely promotional, but it didn't tell you what happened in the world or what happened in your city or what happened with the power broker; they, they covered a different kind of thing and, and that wasn't what I wanted to do; I wanted to do what was--the Tuscaloosa News was doing and The Birmingham News, and what the Hartford Courant was doing, and what The New York Times was doing, that's the kind--and I used to go, by the way, along that time--even when I was in high school [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut], I was always into newspapers in the sense that--my introduction to newspapers was I used to deliver papers when my brother, you know, had a paper route in Alabama and I used to help throw them.  I used to read the papers; it was a little s-, eight-sheeter then, the Tuscaloosa News, and when I got to Hartford [Connecticut], every Saturday--almost every Saturday I used to go to the library, the Hartford Library [Hartford Public Library, Hartford, Connecticut], and I would read the newspapers from all over the country and I--it, it was one of my great thrills, on Saturday morning to go to the Hartford Library and go to the periodic [periodical] section, and they used have these newspapers on the racks, and I would just read all of 'em.  I read the New Orleans Picayune [Times-Picayune], and I remember the San Francisco Chronicle was green--that sports section, at least, was green.  I used to read papers from all over the country, and it's just different stories, and I was just intrigued by that.  So I loved newspapers; even when I was in engineering I used to go and do that, you know; not necessarily on Saturday 'cause we were on study dates trying to prepare for whatever this quiz was, so that's how I, I had this mixed kind of feeling.  But I put engineering behind me and never really looked back; I mean I never really regretted it except, you know, for the fact that it, it disappointed my mother--and my brother, I found out later.  So then, by the time--I'm a junior now in, in college at UConn [University of Connecticut] at Storrs, Connecticut, I'm doing, you know, the English thing, and trying to prepare for a career in the newspaper business.
Story_ID: 361004
Speaker 1: But you, you were gonna make an interesting point for me because you said--because at that time there were no black journalists.
Speaker 2: There are no black journalists.
Speaker 1: But, so how are you preparing to make a go of it in the newspaper business?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I talked to people, I'm, I'm, I'm taking courses and I'm still reading newspapers and, and, and I'm trying to, I suppose, make contacts, but I never made any contacts because--keep in mind that I still have this thing that if black folks haven't done it, we can't do it, or it didn't--the fact that white folks did newspaper stories, to me didn't--wasn't the point, you know.  I mean that's a sad commentary but it, it is a fact.  I mean and, and since I--it turns out that there was a black guy--I found out later he was a black guy, but I didn't even know he was black; his name was Bill Matney [William C. Matney, Jr.], you know.  He was on ABC and he used to come and he said, "Bill Matney, ABC."  He was a very light-skinned guy, and I found out later he was black, but I didn't know he was black.  I mean even on television I didn't know these guys were black, and Bill Matney he was a rep- reporter.  So I, I did know at least this broadcast journalist.  But--and I checked with the Hartford Courant, you know, in Hartford [Connecticut].  I used to deliver the Hartford Courant, you know, which was a morning paper, and The Hartford Times was the afternoon paper; none--neither of them had ever hired a black, ever--in Hartford, but not Alabama.  And so I just, you know, I go through the motions, and I'm--quite frankly, as a student, I'm beginning to lose interest now; I mean I would like to say that I kept up my motivation, but performance is inf-, influenced by rewards and punishment, as you know--and by expectation.  In other words, you pursue a goal if you have a high expectation that you can achieve it.  I'm now--I'm looking back on it (unclear) pursuing goals that, in my heart of hearts, I had to believe that the American reality was that I could not achieve it, you know--that I could not--probably if I had stayed in engineering I may have, you know--I don't know how that would have happened, but I stayed in, in, in--I was an English major, by the way; UConn [University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut] didn't have a journalism major.  But I stayed on track of trying to become a journalist--hoping against hope; I'd never seen one, there's no hope of any in Hartford, so I'm pursuing a goal which increasingly looks unachievable, and that was the conundrum of growing up--[HistoryMaker] Les Payne in Hartford, you know, in the, in the, in the, in the '60s [1960s]--in the early '60s [1960s], is that my--and so I'm not--how motivated could you be?  I mean I began to wane, I mean--like I was, I was an honor student in high school [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut]; I began to, to be indifferent, I began to--you know, I mean I didn't go out and rob any stores or anything, but I think my enthusiasm, you know, was really flagging, and then I began to have to think realistically what am I gonna do with my life?  As graduation approached, I'm saying--whereas, white kids were--they were gonna go and work at their fathers' pharmacy or they're gonna go work at the Hartford Courant, or wherever they were gonna work.  I had no prospects, I had no contacts, I had no one who could give me a job; no one had offered me a job, and the one thing that I did have was I was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].
Story_ID: 361005
Speaker 1: ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had ROTC.  University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut] was a land-grant college, which is to say the first two years are all physically-fit male students--not female--were required to take ROTC, unless they had some excuse.  The last two years, you were not required to take ROTC; it was optional.  Now, I took the last two years (laughter) because the last two years they pay you a little--some little piddling; I think it was like $27.50 a month, which doesn't sound like a lot, but for a student in those days, $27.50 was, was, was, was a lot.  And, you know, it wasn't bad; I mean the country had not fought an embarrassing war at that point.  So at any rate--so I took ROTC the last two years, and so I had ROTC and, you know, obviously who could not do good in ROTC, you know--not challenging intellectually at all.  And so, so I had that, and so now I'm gra-, I'm approaching graduation, and the question is what are you gonna do with your life now?  Four years of college, what are you gonna do?  The newspaper business was impossible.  Someone had told me at that point, you could be--you can have an internship at dah, dah, dah--ah.  But it was, it was a blank wall.  And so I said, okay, the [U.S.] Army; I'm gonna have to go into the Army at some point, I figured.  All of my brothers had gone, my uncles and everyone had gone, and I figured I'd do my two years and get out.  I was commissioned, so you have the option of accepting a commission, so I was commissioned.  So after you complete your second two years, which is to say four years at UConn, then you have the right to be commissioned as a second lieutenant, so I decided that it was better to go into the Army as an officer than to go in as an enlisted man, which is where all of my folks are, so ah, you know (unclear), so I'll go in as an officer.  I went in, so I was commissioned as a second lieutenant upon graduation, and went into the Army in 1963; in fact, September 1963.  I was an anti-aircraft artillery officer. You know, one of the reasons they put me in there is because math and science, you know--the engineering stuff, you know, it helped because it's very high tech by then, and high tech--I mean you're, you're trained to, to run radars and to shoot down, you know, aircraft.  The Russian threat at that point, was considered to be bombers--high-flying bombers, and so the lo-, high-altitude missile was a Nike Hercules missile, to bring down planes at fifty thousand feet above, and so you, you were trained to operate a missile battery which required some math and science as an officer.  So, I was commissioned as a second lieutenant, got into the Army--our first assignment was to--I was supposed to go through nine weeks of training in the Army--Fort Bliss, Texas--and after that nine weeks of training, I would be placed on an anti-missile site with missiles at the Presidio [Presidio of San Francisco] in California, San Francisco [California], and I said, great, San Francisco; man, I always wanted to go there.
Story_ID: 361006
Speaker 1: But at any rate, when I got into the [U.S.] Army, I could not get into my--they called it a C20 class, in which they train you to be an anti-aircraft battery commander, because they said there was something in my background that would not allow me to get a security clearance and--but they didn't tell you what it was.  So, I couldn't get a security clearance so I could not get into this class; you needed a secret clearance to get--to be a student in this class, so I couldn't--I was an officer so I was in Fort Bliss, Texas and couldn't get in my class.  And so, to make a long story short, I couldn't get in my class for eighteen months; every class--like classes started like every three weeks.  Three weeks we--and I still couldn't get in my class then because after you--what had, what had happened is they had triggered a background check and found out that I--they considered me--well, obviously, a security risk.
Speaker 2: Because?
Speaker 1: Because of my participation in student activities at UConn [University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut]--
Speaker 2: What had you done?
Speaker 1: --and they were my--believe me, you know, I'm--we're talking--I was the president of the Northern Student Movement.  Now, the Northern Student Movement was a group--and this is--keep in mind this is the--this is the early '60s [1960s], you know, up until '63 [1963]; sixty--mainly '62 [1962]--sixty--from '61 [1961] to '63 [1963].  The Northern Student Movement was a group that sent a care package to the South; they were student--SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], they would do a sit-in, they were doing sit-ins and, and, and they would say, "Well, let's send some food packages," or whatever, or they would send voter registrants down there to register black voters in the South to vote, and what I'd started was a tutorial program for black kids in the North End of Hartford [Connecticut] because my view was why go all the way to Mississippi?  I mean there's some good we can do here as well.  And one a the reasons I, I took over the organization is because when I was on campus early on, a guy--I walked up to a guy--a white guy was at a desk not unlike like this, you know, and it says, "Northern Student Movement," and the white guy said to me--he handed me some form or something--a petition, you know, and I walked past, as I usually do, and he said, "You ought to help your race."  Now this is a white guy, say, "You're not gonna help your race?"  And so I went back just to find out what this was and this white guy was the head of--he wasn't the head, but he was a, a worker with the Northern Student Movement on campus, you know--and then they were sending care pa-, it was the Northern Student Movement, it was, it was a civil rights group on the campus of University of Connecticut that, you know, worked with registering voters in the South.  So I thought this was a good idea, but I did not like this white guy talking to me about supporting black people.  Here I am, you know, from Alabama, you know.  And so I decided that I was gonna not only work with this Northern Student Movement, I was gonna take it over--that was my goal.  And I did.  I became the president of Northern Student Movement and then we did some things.  And I never went south, I never did any--I mean it was all--it was, believe me, lightweight stuff.  We're not talking Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] here, we're just talking civil rights stuff where you're trying to help black voters or help the kids in the North End.  And apparently the [U.S.] military picked this up and they figured that this was a threat, and they figured that I was too aggressive.  Oh, yeah--and I had written a letter to the editors, and--now this was in my file, that I had written a letter to the editor of the Hartford Courant saying something like, you know, "The problem is not only in the South, there's also problems in the North having to do with racism."  Something--real mild little letter that got printed, you know.  And so they looked at this, and for this reason they would not give me a security clearance, and so I was--for the first eighteen months of my military career at Fort Bliss, Texas I was driving around without security clearance.  When I say driving around, what did you do?  You didn't do these--I would not--you did extra duties, like I would be the area patrol officer; you just drive around and see if there was trash and, you know, I worked in a transportation company, which is not an air defense artillery company where I should have been in, you know, for eighteen months.  And then finally, after eighteen months, you know, they called me in at one point.  I remember I was in ranger school and they, they interviewed the intelligence--they finally begin to tell you why you're--don't have security clearance, and they began to talk to me about my involvement, you know, at the--in, in student activities, you know, at University of Connecticut.
Story_ID: 361007
Speaker 1: And I remember this one poignant thing--this was a colonel of intelligence, you know, who was interviewing me at a desk, and I went in and we recorded the whole thing, and so he asked me if I believed in non-violence.  I thought it was the funniest question I'd ever (laughter) heard, and this is a young guy; even--at the time I, I probably would have laughed.  This was a colonel in the [U.S.] Army and I was, I was in the Army as a second lieutenant, and he asked me if I believed in nonviolence.  No, no.  First, he asked me if I believed in the aims and goals of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and I said, "Well, what are those aims and goals of NAACP?"  He said, "Well, you--we all know what they are."  I say, "No, no, I don't know what they are, let's stipulate.  If you, if you list 'em, then I'll tell you whether I agree with them or not."  I said, "I'm not a member of the NAACP."  So then--that's how we got it.  He said, "Well, what about nonviolence?"  That was the one that he was talking about.  And I said, "Well, what about it?"  He said, "Well, do you believe in nonviolence?"  I said, "I'm in the [U.S.] military," you know.  And I told him I didn't believe in nonviolence.  Now, my reputation, I should say, in--at the University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut] was that of a Black Mu-, I was never a Black Muslim.  I mean I did take up with, with Malcolm--I saw Malcolm X and I got introduced to Malcolm X as a student reading him.  I heard him speak in Hartford [Connecticut], I read James Baldwin, I read Frantz Fanon; I began to be politicized, I should say--that's the part I didn't, that's probably enough to say about him.  I mean I began--in addition to reading Herbert Aptheker, I also, during my college days, began to read--and the, and the Russians and the French.  Toward the end of my career, I began to read James Baldwin, I began to hear about Malcolm X, and I began to read Frantz Fanon.  Those, those were blacks who had--and, and there was a piece called 'Black Rage' [William H. Grier and Price M. Cobbs] written by two black psychiatrists (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Frantz Fanon was black?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Sure, okay, I didn't know.
Speaker 1: He was from Martinique.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah--I imagine so--just because he was French I thought he was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a West Indian--
Speaker 2: --yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah; he's, he's a West Indian--he's from Martinique.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: He's, he's, he's your complexion, my complexion.  But yeah, he's, he's black and, and so--and he began to--they began to talk about the psycho-, psychologic-, he was a psychiatrist, you know, who's from Martinique and French, and he talked about the psychological impact of racism, or bigotry, on the psyche, you know--Frantz Fanon.  And then I began to understand why I had to get rid of all of the baggage--not just the intellectual baggage, but the psychic baggage that I'd picked up growing up black in America, North and South.  First, I got rid of the intellectual baggage by finding out that I can get A's and they can get A's; they didn't know any more about Dostoyevsky [Fyodor Dostoyevsky] than I did; they didn't know any more about Norman Mailer than I did, you know--they being white.  So I got rid of--I overcame my conditioned sense of intellectual inferiority by associating with white people in, in Hartford.  If I had never associated with 'em, I don't--you know, I probably would still think, in the back of my mind, that they were better.  And I found out that they sure--they, they are not.  But after getting rid of my intellectual and--sense of inferiority, I still had a psychic sense of inferiority, which is to say that that thing that's deeper than just the intellect, you know, and Malcolm and Fanon, Price Cobbs [HistoryMaker Dr. Price Cobbs] and Grier [William H. Grier] began to help me with that psychology because these, these were people who dealt with the mind.  Cobbs and Grier were psychiatrists, Frantz Fanon was a psychiatrist, and they began to talk about the impact of bigotry, racism, you know, on the, on the, on the psyche, and so by the end of college, and after listening to Malcolm X speak, I had gotten rid of my sense, both of intellectual inferiority and psychic inferiority.  And I just may say, by the way, that it is my view--this is an opinion--it is my view that most black achievers are achievers because they overcome their intellectual sense of inferiority.  However, most black achievers do not necessarily overcome their sense of psychic inferiority vis-a-vis whites, and I would say that most of them have not.  Most of the white people--most of the black--even the black achievers that I have encountered have not overcome their sense of psychic inferiority, and I include King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and I include Baldwin, and--but--and I, and I thought that the person who had the answer to this is Malcolm, by the way.  But that's, that's an aside.
Story_ID: 361008
Speaker 1: Here I am at, at Fort Bliss, Texas, and this guy is asking me, you know, if, if I believe in nonviolence and I told him, "No."  I told, I told him that I think people, black people, should defend themselves.  I told him, "I don't, I don't believe in nonviolence; I don't believe in sitting in and laying in.  I, I'm, you know, you know--."  I told him that.  But despite that, I got, I got my security clearance and, and went to my C20 class, and then I got extended because there was a build-up, you know, by this time it was 1965, and there was a build-up in Vietnam, and so all regular [U.S.] Army officers--I was a regular Army officer; that's the commission that I took.  All regular Army officers were extended and they could be without--you, you had no option.  What would happen is that coming up to three years, you would put in a request to get out, and then they could grant it or not, and they just blanketly did not grant it, so I was extended.  No, they can only extend you for eighteen months at a time, so they extended me and retrained me, in their words, as an Army journalist, and sent me to Vietnam, and so I went to Vietnam in--I went to Vietnam in 1967, and I was there most of 19--from January '67 [1967] to January '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Can you remember some of the s-, the issues you covered in Vietnam--the things you wrote about for the Army?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I mean, I mean I said I was an Army journalist but, you know--I mean journalism is to the Army what Army food is to food (laughter).  I mean I was, I was a propagandas, man; I mean I was--I didn't really cov-, okay, here's what I did--I mean I wrote the Army newspaper, you know; I was the editor, publisher, I was the editor of the Army newspaper.  Okay, when I, when I went to Vietnam, I was a--the [U.S.] military people will understand--a 5505; that was my military occupational specialty, my MOS.  The 5505, we'll just say a journalist; if you look that up that's what it'll say--Army journalist, that's what I was.  But, I ran the newspaper, I wrote speeches for Westmoreland [General William C. Westmoreland], I wrote messages, we answered some of his letters and stuff, and I also worked in an office that dealt with the civilian press.  The civilian--five hundred-odd civilians would come over to cover the war [Vietnam War] from all over--mainly the U.S., but Europe as well, and they would be handled by MACV, Military Advisory Command, Vietnam [Military Assistance Command, Vietnam], MACV.  So, I worked for Westmoreland on his staff as an information officer; we worked with the civilian press.  If they wanna get to the battle zone, we would tell 'em how to get there and we would give them briefings, and that sort of thing, so I did that.  But those were the kinds of jobs that I did, you know as, as, as an Army journalist. I was not a combatant, I was not armed.  I was only armed twice, and I think it was when I was a payroll officer, so I was not a combatant and I did not kill anybody, thank God, and I don't think I would have.
Story_ID: 361009
Speaker 1: So, before we just move away from Vietnam and come back to see--what were your feelings at the time about the war [Vietnam War] itself?
Speaker 2: I was against the war, I was against the war when I was in it, by the way and, and you can--as they say, you can look it up.  I mean I was--I always thought it was, it was ill-advised, I thought that--there were three officers that I knew, you know, who were against the war while we were in it, and I'm sure there were many others--Bill Nack [William Nack], myself, and a man named Henry Spencer [ph.]--and we used to talk about it during the war.  I mean one was a--lieutenant J.G. [junior grade], and Bill Nack, you know, was a, was a lieutenant who worked for me.  By this time I was a captain, and I was against the war because I thought it was ill-advised and I thought it was a, it was a colonial war, and I thought that it was Europeans trying to, yet again, to suppress Vietnam, and I, I understood it by this point; I thought that, you know, when they, they would say that, you know, that there was a domino effect that--I mean they, they said essentially the policy was--although we wrote differently on, on--you know--the stuff that, that we put in those pamphlets was quite different, but it wasn't under my name--was that, you know, if the U.S. were not there, that Vietnam would be controlled by the Vietnamese, you know (laughter), I mean, you know, what else is there?  And so I, I, I was, I was against the war, you know, then and now, you know, but, you know, I remember when Muhammad Ali came out on, you know, that first--that's the first time I saw it in the black context, you know?  I would love to say that I--when Muhammad Ali came out against the war and said that he wasn't gonna--no Viet-, no Vietcong ever called him a nigger?  I mean I, I--I mean that was, that was very startling for me, although my sentiments were already there; I mean I just thought he put it in a language, you know, that was quite perceptive, you know, and, and, and, and, and, and nonetheless true.
Speaker 1: What year was that that he was drafted, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you were--so, by that time, you'd made captain already (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were eventually a captain, correct?
Speaker 2: I was a captain, yeah.
Story_ID: 361010
Speaker 1: I was a captain in, in sixty--I was a captain when I was sent to Vietnam (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) Okay, so how did all of--how, how did it end--your, your [U.S.] Army career, how--?
Speaker 1: Okay.  I, I did, I did--I, I requested again to get out, and then they extended me for another eighteen months.  They said, "You're extended for another eighteen months and then you can get out," so I ended up serving almost six years.  I went back to Fort Bliss [Texas] aft-, the end of that, and then I got out--I mustered out.  And, and I should say that what was happening then in terms of--I was thinking of either going into law--I was thinking of going to Columbia Law School [New York, New York], or applying--I was, I was, I was preparing to take the LSATs.  Even when I was in Vietnam, I--you know, I applied for the LSATs.  I was honing up, I was gonna take the, the law exam, you know and, and apply to law school.  I was probably gonna--Columbia was the school I was, I was interested in going to.  And keep in mind that when I was in Vietnam, worked with the civilian press, you know--reporters from The Baltimore Sun, New York Times [The New York Times]--I knew many of them, worked with them, we had all of their stuff and, and, and formed some contacts, and I met a guy who eventually ended up at Newsday, and that's how I ended up at Newsday.
Speaker 2: Who was the guy that you met there?
Speaker 1: Bill Nack [William Nack].
Speaker 2: Bill Nack.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you met him during your time in Vietnam?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 361011
Speaker 1: Eighteen months later--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) they--you're honorably discharged--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and what happens?
Speaker 2: Before I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is 1968, correct?
Speaker 2: This is 1969.
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969].  So King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] has been killed by then.
Speaker 2: King was killed in '68 [1968], February the 4th [sic.]--
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's talk about the King because you, you wrote--
Speaker 2: I was in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: --you were in the Army, but you said you wrote about the King assassination.
Speaker 2: No, no, I investigated--
Speaker 1: Okay, you invest-, okay.
Speaker 2: --the King assassination after I got to Newsday.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But King was killed--well--and King was killed--as you know, I mean April 4th, 1968.  I was in the Army at Fort Bliss, Texas.  We had a parade that day.  I think he was killed on like a Thursday or a Friday, and we had a parade that Saturday and I, I put a--I wore a black arm band on my uniform, which is a, a court-martial offense, and you can't be--you're, you're out of uniform as an officer.  But I did, you know, and went on the parade field, and my wife [Violet Payne] can, could tell you.  And I, I, I can't say I was defying, you know, people to, to, to, to, to apprehend me, but I, I just did it because I--that's the way I felt, knowing full well that it was illegal to do that, you know?  But I did it, you know; I mean that was my little small personal protest, you know, a statement as, as, as it were--not protest, but statement about how I felt about what had happened because I thought, you know, I knew and suspected deeply, you know, that white America had killed him, you know, because he was trying to help black folks, you know, and that was my statement, but--yeah.  So, I got out in--now, even before I got out of the Army, what happened is that I came to--I applied to News-, I had a--well, the big thing that happened is the riots, you know--the big thing that happened is the riots--the riots that happened in Newark [New Jersey], the riots, you know, the--that happened in Detroit [Michigan], that happened in New York [New York], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], you know.  And after King was killed, I mean the city--Washington, D.C. went up, so we're talking--in April of '68 [1968], the cities were in flames.  And what happened with the riots is very interesting as it applies to journalism, and as it, since we're talking about me, as it applies to me.  Before the riots, you couldn't get a job in journalism, you know, but after the riots, (laughter) they were looking for blacks in journalism, you know.  And, and it wasn't just in journalism but it, it was at General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company].  I mean if you look at the record in Detroit, there was a guy--it was a group a people in Detroit, and this is how it went.  There were a group a people in Detroit who was trying to get jobs for youth, black youth, for the summertime--and no jobs before the riots in Detroit.  After the riots, 50,000 jobs, you know; they kept 50,000 jobs they set aside, and that's the way it was in journalism.
Story_ID: 361012
Speaker 1: And so Newsday and other enlightened publishers were trying to find blacks so that--now, the reason why they did it is because of the Kerner Commission report.  After the riots, there was something called the Presidential Commission on Civil Disorders [sic. National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders], and it was called the Kerner Commission report, named after Governor Kerner [Otto Kerner, Jr.]; I think he was of Pennsylvania [sic. Illinois], and so this report critiqued the media.  It said one a the reasons the media covered the riots so poorly was because they didn't have any black reporters, and that they were covering the riots from the fire station and from the police department, and they didn't cover from the community, and they needed black reporters if they wanted to cover the cities, and that's why The New York Ti-, The New York Times and Bill Moyers [Bill D. Moyers], who was the publisher of Newsday at that point, they began to look for black reporters.  Now, Bill Nack [William Nack], the contact that I knew, was working by this time; he was working at Newsday, so when he wrote me--we were corresponding back and forth, and I told him I was going to law school and--but by this point I said I may even go to Columbia and get my degree in journalism; I was gonna go to Columbia Grad School for Journalism [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York].  And he said, "You don't need to go to Columbia Grad School for Journalism, I mean you're a journalist, I mean, you know, you're in the [U.S.] Army, you edited the copy of people."  So, he said--he wrote a, wrote a note to Newsday and said, "You ought to interview this guy."  They called me in, and I got interviewed and they hired me, you know.  I came in in my uniform, you know, so sort of says, "Soon as you get out of the Army, we'll give you a job."  So that's how I got to Newsday and that's how I got into journalism.
Story_ID: 361013
Speaker 1: And that--what year was that?  Was that sixty--
Speaker 2: This was--I started Newsday in September of 1969--1969.
Speaker 1: So, if we g-, that's '69 [1969]--what was the Babylon [New York] town beat?
Speaker 2: Well, Babylon is a town in--it, it's, it's a town in--on Long Island [New York].  Newsday is a Long Island paper, founded in 1940; it covers the two counties of Nassau [Nassau County, New York] and Suffolk County [New York], and then within those towns they have a lot of--within the, the counties, Nassau and Suffolk County, they have a lot of smaller towns; Babylon is the name of one of the towns and, and so I was--two reporters usually were assigned to each town--Smithtown [New York], Babylon, Islip [New York], you know, and Babylon was a town that I was assigned to as a young reporter (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, when you joined Newsday, Babylon, I'm assuming, you didn't cover black issues; you were just a beat reporter.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a beat reporter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Newsday, I should say--I mean Long Island, at that point, was like 95 percent white.  Not only 95 percent white, but I mean it was a, it was a, it was a white homeland; I mean people had come to Long Island escaping New York City [New York, New York] to get away from black people in the city, not just the riots.  But to get away from black people in the city, they escaped, escaped to Long Island, so Long Island was very much a white township--95 percent white.  Most of my readers were white, most of Newsday's readers were white, most of all--all the towns were all overwhelmingly, predominantly white, you know, on Long Island; it's kind of like Hartford High [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut] when I first went there (laughter).
Story_ID: 361014
Speaker 1: So then in 19--like in '71 [1971], you became an assistant editor or '77 [1977] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In '77 [1977], yeah, yeah.  Well, okay, in terms of my career I, I, I reported from 1969 until 1980, essentially, roughly eleven years.  In 1980, I was named the national editor, and then in '85 [1985], assistant managing editor.  I ran the national desk, the foreign desk, health and science, and then in 1996 also, in addition to those duties, I also ran New York City [New York, New York] for Newsday.  I mean that's my kind of rough outline.
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about some of the, some of the highlights of, of your career at Newsday, and let's start early though--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I mean some of the earlier highlights.  I mean the--go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I, I started the--I started in September of 1969, and one of the, one of the stories--the stories that got me noticed, you know, that I did in less than--in the first, first few months I was there; it was a story about the migrants on Long Island [New York], and one of the things that was interesting about that story is that Long Island had migrant workers from the South--people from--mainly from South Carolina and North Carolina; not as deep as Mississippi and Alabama but, you know, 'cause--I had a full--all kinds of reasons, but at any rate, they got 'em from North Carolina, South Carolina, they would come up and work on the potato fields on Long Island and, and they lived under hard conditions, you know; they were treated roughly, they were not paid well, and Newsday had written about this.  And one of the things that I noticed, is that when Newsday wrote about, that they very seldom talked to the migrants, you know; they would talk to the farm owner, they would talk to VISTA [Volunteers in Service to America; AmeriCorps VISTA]. They would talk to social workers, they would talk to welfare workers, but they wouldn't--no one is--I said, "Why, why don't we talk to the migrants, see how they feel about this?"  They said, "Well, it's tough to talk to the migrants because it's private property, they don't allow you on to talk to them, they won't give you permission to talk to them, and besides, the migrants are largely, you know, uneducated and from the South and they don't wanna talk to you at any rate."  So, I said, "Well, how can you write stories around migrant workers on Long Island and you don't talk to the migrants?"  I just thought that was pretty weird, which is what the Kerner Commission [National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders] report said, how can you cover riots in inner cities when you don't talk to the people in inner cities?  And reason why they didn't talk to the people in inner cities because all the reporters were white and they were intimidated, you know, so we had a (unclear).  So, I said, okay, I made it--I was determined we had a summer journal, and I was determined to try to talk to some migrants, and so I found out, yes it was tough, it was private property; some of these people were armed and they would not allow you to go onto these farms where they were, so what happened is that--I was married by this time and, and so I sent my wife [Violet Payne] and daughter [Tamara Payne] to my relatives up in--I drove 'em up to Connecticut and let them stay there for a week, and then I came back and hitchhiked out on the East End--to the East End of Long Island--t-shirt and jeans--and got a job.  And I told 'em that I was down on my luck and I needed some money and, and, and asked if I could get a job and, you know, they didn't ask a lot of questions.  I told 'em my name was Bubba, you know, and that--and to account for my accent because I don't (unclear) sound that southern.  I told 'em I was from Alabama, but I--but to account for my accent, I told them that I, you know, had lived in Connecticut, you know, and worked on the tobacco fields in Connecticut, which I had.  And so, so I worked on the farm for a week, and worked up to payday and wrote a story about living on the farm, and then boom.  It was spectacular, and that, that got me started.
Story_ID: 361015
Speaker 1: So, continuing.  Just--if you can just tell me just--the experience itself.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, you hitchhiked, you got the job, but the week you spent on--in the fields with the migrant workers [on Long Island, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who did you talk to?  What did you talk about?
Speaker 2: Well I, I had one source going in who--a guy who had been a former migrant himself, and I talked to him before going in and, and he, he was the only who knew that I was a reporter, you know, I trusted him.  And he gave me tips on how to survive and he said, "Look," he says, "you have to drink wine with 'em, swear," he said, "you know, you got to curse all the time, and you have to fight if it 'cause, you know--to, to be believable."  He said, "But don't mess with their women or you'll get your throat cut," (laughter), you know.  And that, that--those--that was my instruction, you know.  And so I drank wine and, you know, they drank wine all the time; that's what they--they supplied 'em with wine, and they had wine at the breakfa-, cheap wine--Twister wine, sixty-five cents a, like a quart, you know, breakfast table they're drinking this wine and, and these guys are just, you know, hobbling around and, and, you know, they were working 'em in the fields.  And so I worked for a week and got to know them very well.  I was on a crew; there were about three of us on a crew, and we laid irrigation pipes; that's what we were doing the week I was there.  And then I got discovered, you know, the Thursday before--Friday was payday, and on the Thursday before payday, a guy had--the crew chief that I worked for--what happened is that we lived in a barracks, a room roughly the size of this, that housed like twenty-four men double-bunked up and down; they slept in their clothes, you know.  I don't remember there being a shower.  I was only there a week; I know I didn't shower that week.  Men slept in their clothes.  I mean it was close quarters; they would work and then go to the fields, come back, drink wine then, you know, lollygag, go to bed, get up early the next morning; that, that's what their days and evenings were.  Sometime they'd sneak into the drive-in theater--walk into it not, not drive, they didn't have cars, walk into it, and try to watch a movie, you know, in the back and then, you know, go out or go to the bootlegger's house and get some more cheap wine at a higher price, and that's the way their days and nights went.  But any rate, the crew chief for whatever reason--and I did--what I said, you know, I wanted to do very little talking because I knew, you know, I don't sound exactly like a migrant, you know, and I didn't particularly look like a migrant, although there were some out there my age.  And the migrants were taken in, you know; they began to feel sorry for me.  I--you know, I told 'em, you know, I didn't--you know, I used to--I'd been knocking around and stuff, you know, and, and, and they bought it.
Story_ID: 361016
Speaker 1: I wrote about these characters, but the crew chief [of the migrant workers on Long Island, New York], you know, who's no fool--something about me, I don't know quite what it was, struck him, you know, that--he said, "I don't know about this guy."  So, I remember it was one Thursday I came in from the field and it was raining, that's why we came in early, and I noticed that the crew chief--his name was James Brown [ph.] believe it or not--he was closeted with this guy and I was--closet means just talking to him on the steps.  For the longest time, every now and then, they would nod over at me and we were--a bunch of us were over on, on this, this picnic table under a tree drinking wine, which is what we did (laughter), and so this guy--I noticed, you know, I was alert, you know; he would nod over at me every now and then, and then this guy walks directly toward me.  He said, "Bubba," he said--I said, "Yes," and he said, he said, "I understand you're from Tuscaloosa [Alabama]," and I said, "Yes."  And he said, "Do you know where Tooson service station is?"  And I said, "Yeah, it's at 37th Avenue, 22nd Street."  And I said, "In fact, Alonzo Tooson was a friend of my brothers."  So he said, "What are the radio stations at Tuscaloosa?"  I said, "WTV-, -TVC [WTVC, DeKalb County, Alabama], WJRD [WJRD Radio, Tuscaloosa, Alabama]."  In other words, he had found a guy from Tuscaloosa to come and check me out to see if I was really from Tuscaloosa.  Now, luckily I said I was from Tuscaloosa (laughter), I mean if I said I was from Greensboro [North Carolina] or if I, if I said I was from Jackson, Mississippi, I would have been in deep trouble, all right?  I would have been in deep trouble because, you know, I didn't, I didn't know it.  So he sat me out there and he queried me about Tuscaloosa and then turns out that I told him 'bout my uncle (unclear) and dah, dah, dah, and then, you know, it satisfied him sufficiently, you know, that, that at least I was from Tuscaloosa, but he didn't know what else might have been happening.  But this was Thursday.  Now, by right I was very upset.  I said, man, it's time to get out of here.  But I couldn't leave because the whole idea of working out there a week is to get paid, to see what payday was like.  So I had to spend a night there, and it was raining that night--I never will forget it; he closed--he locked the doors of the barracks, for the first time.  I stayed awake all night man; I ne-, I never got one ounce of--I kept my eye on him 'cause he slept in the back with his wife.  He and his wife had a television back there and we could hear it, you know, in a small tiny room, and then we were out in this kind of dormitory kind of area, you know.  And, and I, I was awake all night, you know, kind of just making sure that he wasn't following up on the, on this inquest, but I knew what that was about.  So--and then I wrote the story, you know, which is--which, which got a lot of wide attention; I mean it just--and then it, it put me on the map, you know, as, as being a reporter of some consequence, you know, and--but that was, that was the first piece [for Newsday] that I did.
Speaker 2: And that was about 1970, you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was 19--that was July--the story appeared in July 1970.
Story_ID: 361017
Speaker 1: So what followed that story [about Long Island, New York's migrant community]?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that followed that story is that I was still doing--well, I was doing--God, I mean I, I--my, my career just, as a young reporter, wasn't typical; keep in mind, I wasn't typical either because even though I was a young reporter in terms of experience, I had spent six years in the [U.S.] Army; I mean I was a world traveler, I was captain in the   Army, graduate univ-, you know, so I, I'd been pretty--my life's experience was not that of a typical green reporter, so--and luckily, Newsday was the kind of paper that could take advantage of my potential and experience because I'd run a newspaper, you know, for the--in the, in the Army, and I also had my own magazine, you know, a magazine called Uptight, which I'll just mention.  I mean when I was in the Army, I came back--I'm, I'm--I'll get to your question but I'm digressing a little--a half-second, but this is important in a way.  When I got back from Vietnam, I wanted to write then, you know, and I wanted to write about some a these stories, and I wanted to write about some a the things I saw, so I wrote some stories; I sent 'em to Esquire, Playboy--you name it--Reader's Digest; got all the rejection slips, rejection slips, rejection slips.  So I started my magazine, my own magazine, while I was still in the Army, and this magazine was called Uptight.  It was a black opinion--it was a black magazine--it was a magazine of black opinion, and I ran it, I was a publisher, owner, I had a student at the University of Texas; it was Texas Western [Texas Western College of the University of Texas; University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas] at that point.  He was fronting for it as the editor; his name was Kelly Myrick [ph.], and I had a phony name; my name was Z.E. Kumo, I just made it up, you know, from the 1968 Olympics [1968 Summer Olympics, Mexico City, Mexico], and so I was listed as the, as the publisher.  And now, it was a court-martial offense outside it because it was a court-martial offense to, to, to write a publication like this without the Army's permission, especially when it's an anti-, you know, it, it, it was a black magazine criticizing the president and everybody else.  And so--so I had that experience as well as, you know, the Army experience--Army's experience.
Story_ID: 361018
Speaker 1: Getting back to, to (unclear)--so, what happened after that is--and even before I did the, the migrant piece [about Long Island, New York's migrant community], I started covering the, the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party].  I'd been at Newsday for three months, and December 18th of 1969, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were killed in Chicago [Illinois], and there was a very famous shootout between the--Geronimo Pratt, who served many years in prison, who was released, you know, after serving like twenty-seven--twenty years in prison.  But Geronimo Pratt got into a shootout with the police in Los Angeles [California] in December of 1969, and this was the beginning of the SWAT team; it was the first times a SWAT team was ever used, SWAT meaning Special Weapons and Tactics.  And Newsday wanted to write an editorial about the Panthers, but then someone said, "How can we write an editorial when we haven't done any stories?"  So they said, "Okay, let's put together a team and write about it."  So, they had a very veteran writer name Pat Owens [Patrick J. Owens], and he wanted a black--he was smart enough to have a black reporter to go with him, so I was that reporter picked to go with him.  So Pat and I, we went out to California; we went out to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to investigate this shootout between the Black Panthers and the police, which resulted in the case of the L.A. 28--L.A. 18.  And we also looked--stopped by Chicago--Fred Hampton and Mark Clark--and looked in on that.  And so we went out there to, to, to, to write this, and during that time, I mean I interviewed--by this time Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] was in prison; he was in San Luis Obispo [California], prison [California Men's Colony], and I got an interview.  I interviewed him while he was in prison to talk to him about the Panthers, how he started the Panthers, what the Panthers were all about.  At the same time, Bobby Se-, he founded the Black Panthers with Bobby Seale, and Bobby Seale, by this time, was in the Alameda County Jail [Santa Rita, California] fighting extradition back to New Haven [Connecticut] to be tried for the Alex Rackley murder; this was the early, troubling, turbulent days of the Black Panthers.  So I, I interviewed Bobby Seale in the San Luis--in, in the Alameda County Jail.  And then I began, during those, those three months, to cover the Panthers on the West Coast and back in New York [New York].  They had a branch in New York; they had one in, in Harlem [New York, New York], you know, and they had another one up in the Bronx [New York], and I got to know all of them well, and used to go around--I used to hang out with 'em, I used to write about them, I used to--I got to know them very well.  So I covered the Panthers; the migrant story came later.  As a result of that, I was developing a reputation as being kind of a gutsy, risk-taker of a reporter who could report as well as write, who was very good at street reporting.  And, and, and, and like a lot of street reporter-, unlike a lot of street reporters, also could write in a sense that--always wanted to write.  So like a lot of reporters, you know, they're good on the street but they can't write, and writing is really what I really wanted to do.  And, and a lot of the people who tend to be good writers and motivated writers don't learn the reporting craft, so I had--luckily, I had both of them, or learned both of them. And so I began, I suppose, to get a--develop a reputation at Newsday, and in journalism, I should say, you know, as being--and, and when we covered the Panthers we covered some very breaking, important national stories about the Panthers.
Story_ID: 361019
Speaker 1: The other thing that happened is that the heroin epidemic was gripping America, and particularly New York [New York].  New York was the heroin capital; New York was the--New York City, mainly Harlem [New York, New York] and Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York], was the heroin consumption capital of the world.  I think in the year--roughly around '70 [1970], '71 [1971], it was like 1100 drug overdoses in New York City alone--1100 heroin overdoses--people dying from drugs.  Now, the murder rate in New York now is like six hundred a year--homicide rate is like six hundred a year in '06 [2006]; well, back then 1100 drug overdoses.  I mean it was in--it was incredible epidemic, and not only was people dying of heroin overdoses, but to get the heroin, most of these people were not employed.  There was a lot of crime: muggings, people stealing tape decks, breaking into houses; crime rates was astronomical, and I think over two thousand people were killed a year in homicides, a lot of it drug-connected.  So, Newsday, at that point, you know--this is in '71 [1971], began to say, okay, because what had happened is that drugs began to creep into the white communities, so Newsday, which is a white suburban community--it was not in New York City at that point, it's mainly on Long Island [New York]--began to be interested in--to find out how they can begin to write about this heroin epidemic that was beginning--only beginning to get into the white suburbia, and so they put together a team of three reporters.  The team leader was a guy name Bob Greene [Robert W. Greene], who was a legendary investigative reporter; he had won a Pulitzer Prize for land scandals that he had written about in--on Long Island--in Babylon [New York], by the way--Babylon town.  So, they told him he could have the pick of the litter; he could put together a team of two reporters to go abroad and look at the--they wanna look at the international flow of heroin; not just to cover it as a local New York story, but to cover it--how does heroin get here?  Well, it gets here--at that point, 80 percent of the heroin was coming from, from Turkey and through the French connection--Marseille [France] mainly, the Marseille area and into, essentially, the veins of the junkies.  And so Newsday was gonna put together this team; Greene had the pick of the litter; he chose me as one of the two reporters--I and a fellow name Newt Royce, and I was picked for a number of reasons; my [U.S.] military background didn't hurt.  Here I was, a former captain, a ranger--clearly someone who could take care of himself and could travel abroad, and I was also developing a reputation as somebody with the migrant story [about Long Island, New York's migrant community] and the Panther [Black Panther Party]--as somebody, you know, who had learned the--was learning the craft.  So I was picked, you know, for that particular story, and the three of us we went to investigate essentially the international flow of heroin, you know, and we wanted to trace it from the poppy fields in Turkey, where it is converted into morphine base, to the laboratories in Marseille area France, where this morphine base is converted chemically into heroin, and then that heroin was shipped, you know, dockside, into United States, so that, that was a story, and it was a great adventure.  I mean here I am a young reporter on this international story, and we ended up spending, you know, it was eight months abroad.  We, we bought a villa--or rented a villa--leased a villa in, in Istanbul [Turkey], and lived there for three months, and while we were doing that, we were investigating--unbeknownst to the Turkish government, which was--martial law was in Turkey at that point.  We were int-, we were investigating how Turkey--how the, the farmers in Afyon [Afyonkarahisar Province, Turkey], which is where--the part of Turkey where it was grown--how do they grow the opium poppy, and how do they get--how does it, it get from being opium to morphine base, and how does it get to France?  And so we covered that.  And who makes the money?  How does it travel?  Those are things that, that the three of us we finding, and we did document that.  Then, after three months there, then we moved to France; we, we bought a villa--rented a villa in, in a little place called Le Lavandou [France], which is on the Mediterranean [Mediterranean Sea], which is between Marseille and Nice [France] and, and from that base where we were living, I mean we looked at the French connection, you know, and reported on it--again, another three and a half months.  And then after that, then we came back to the states and then wrote the piece, which became a book called 'The Heroin Trail' [Newsday Editors].  We got the Pulitzer [Pulitzer Prize] in 1974, and I think it still stands up pretty much as, as an account of how it worked back in those days--how the international drugs case happened.
Story_ID: 361020
Speaker 1: That ['The Heroin Trail,' Newsday Editors] was your first Pulitzer [Pulitzer Prize], and then the second comes--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, the second--I didn't get (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that's, the second they took away.  The second one I covered the--this was in 1974, and in 1976, the Soweto uprising happened in South Africa, so I requested that Newsday send me; Newsday didn't have any foreign bureaus at that point, so I had requested that they send me to cover this Africans--this, this story--the Soweto uprising in South Africa, and they agreed after some time, although I had some trouble getting a visa.  I finally used Arthur Ashe's contacts to help me get a visa to South Africa, and I went to South Africa and, and spent, you know, three and a half, four months there writing about the disturbance of the Africans in South Africa, and that was given a Pulitzer Prize by the, the--by the board but--it was given a Pulitzer Prize by the selection committee, but the board took it away; they overturned it for their own reasons--I won't even care to get into it because I don't know what they were.  So--and that was four years later, so that, that would have been the second Pulitzer.
Speaker 1: But tell me about the experience going to South Africa.  You did the reporting, you said you were kicked out--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you had to somehow enter the country again, unbeknownst to the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, the first time I--I got a visa, went through the front door and, and the thing that I guess we should understand is that most of the reporters who were sent from America, and of course from Europe, were white, and therefore could not gain access, or did not gain access sufficiently to the black majority in South Africa, all right.  Not unlike with the migrants [on Long Island, New York], you know; they didn't--for, for, for--and for the same reasons.  Now, what I was able to do, and the reporting that I was able to do in South Africa was one of the--just as with the migrants, what I noticed is that people were not talking to the Africans, they were talking to the prime minister, they were talking to Vorster [B.J. Vorster], they're talking to the chief of police, they were talking to the newspaper, they're talking to everyone except the Africans, so I said, "Well, why aren't they talking to the Africans in Soweto [South Africa] and in Langa [South Africa] and Gugulethu [South Africa]?"  These were black townships.  And the reason why they were not is because South Africa placed these townships off-limits; in other words, foreign correspondents--if you wanted to go--this is after the uprising in '76 [1976].  If you wanted to go into Soweto, you would have to go to the commander who's in charge of Soweto who's a--at that point he was a, a brigadier--South African brigadier name Visser [J. Visser]--I happen to remember his name--Visser, and you would say, "Can I go into South Africa?" and he'd say--"Into Soweto?"  He'd say, "Why would you want Soweto?"  You'd say, "Well, you know, I wanna interview X, Y and Z."  And he'd say, he would say, "No."  And then he would go and check on X, Y and Z--see how that you--some journalist get, you know, their name--that it would get 'em in trouble, you see?  So--and so that's the way it worked because all of the black townships were off-limits.
Story_ID: 361021
Speaker 1: I, as an African American, I was able to just go into South Africa, you see.  I didn't--I mean I should have and could have requested permission but I didn't; I just drove in, had a rental car would drive into Soweto [South Africa]--Soweto was a huge area, by the way.  1,600,000 Africans lived there; it was sixteen miles from Johannesburg [South Africa], and it was a black township where blacks lived and, and they worked in Johannesburg, but they lived in this township, you know.  And so I just went in there and hung out with them, went to the shebeen with them, talked to them, you know, and that's where I did my reporting from.  And as an African American, I was able to do it, whereas white reporters--and all the reporters were white--could not do this because they would have been spotted, they didn't have permission, you know, to get in there, and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.  So I was able to get stories out of there that, that other American reporters could not get, and other newspapers had not been smart enough to send black reporters with the courage and the chutzpah to go in and to do that, so I got stories that they didn't get.  One of the big stories that I got, by the way, which was a centerpiece of my coverage, was the South Africans who pride themselves in telling the truth, and said that roughly 250 Africans had been killed during the disturbance [Soweto uprising].  And what I found is that more than eight hundred and fi-, and I documented name, date, ages of 850.  So at least two and a half times more, you know, than--and, and probably even more than that.  And documented how and why they lied, you see, and they were very embarrassed by that.  And, and, and I was able to do it by going--I mean I, I developed--I'm the one who had the will to do it.  And, and what--when I would go making my rounds in Soweto, I would talk to the Africans about what their life was like and whatever, and why were they running from the police, and I would say--and they would say, "Oh, by the way," says, "far more Africans are being killed than they are saying in the, in the papers here."  So I said, "Really?  How many?"  And they say, "Well, we don't know, but some of them are illegal--dah, dah, dah, but didn't have their passes," so they didn't know, so I says--I set about to find it out.  So what I did is I got a name, I got the list of all the funeral homes in Soweto.  Again, this is a large community of 1,600,000 Africans--got the name of all the funeral homes in Soweto, and I started (unclear), I would go knock.  Invariably, what would happen, I would go and say, "How many people do you--."  Now, the thing that you know when you go to a foreign--particularly a colonized country, is that you're looking--you look at the characteristics of the so-called mother country.  Now, in England, you know, they don't write hardly anything down (laughter), you know.  I mean they haven't gotten around to writing their constitutions yet.  But the Dutch write down everything, the Germans write down everything, just like the (unclear); everything is written out somewhere.  And believe me, in Germany and, and in Holland [the Netherlands] it's written down somewhere; they are very assiduous; very, very careful record-keepers, all right?  So you know it's written down somewhere.  So, at any rate--so when--so each of the funeral directors have to write down that if someone was--if an, if an African was killed with a head wound, they would say why it connected; if he died hit by a car running from the disturbance, it was riot-connected, you see?  So it have to--so the mortician who buried the body would have to give the cause of death, you see?  And so that's how--so invariably--and I devised tricks for them for tell me and then--I won't get into the long--this is all jour-, inside journalism stuff, but I developed tricks.  Suffice it to say--to get the names from the funeral home, that's how I got--instead of 250, like 860, I think, was--with my name--and dates, ages, circumstances under which they were killed.  And some of the families didn't even know that their people had been killed.  They were still searching morgues, searching for--hoping that they had escaped the country.  And I printed the names and everything and, and, and, and, and it was a very important story, both in South Africa and outside of South Africa, and so that and other stories were, were, were the kind of stories that, that I was able to do.  And I cite it because of, you know, the need for, for, for, for blacks to get into these kinds of stories.
Story_ID: 361022
Speaker 1: You also saw the need for blacks to get in-, for more blacks to get into the field of journalism itself around the same time (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Around about that time, yeah, 1975.
Speaker 1: And, so tell me how you came about to become one of the founders of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists].
Speaker 2: Well, a group of us found ourselves--there weren't very many blacks in journalism at that time.
Speaker 1: Who were the people in that--in the group?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were fifty of us and we--what we found is that, like if there was an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] convention--national convention--or Urban League [National Urban League] convention, we find out--we go cover that and we find out that's where all the blacks--reporters would congregate, NAACP convention, (unclear), so we kept meeting each other and we said, "Why don't we organize?"  So one time we were covering something in Washington [D.C.], in 1975, and we said--we got together and said, "Let's organize a national association of black journalists," and it was [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone's idea.  Chuck Stone was a very experienced--he had worked with Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]; he's very savvy political player, let's say--and, and visionary, too in, in many ways, and he--I won't say he got us together; we got ourselves together but he really was a driving force for organizing this thing.  So we organized the National Association of Black Journalists, you know, in 1975.  There were about fifty of us, you know, and the whole idea was to--we, we organized and wrote bylaws, you know.  The reason why we organized is because we, we figured that the regime that we were up against, which is to say white journ-, the industry of white journalism, which was not working for the best interests of black journalists, you know, or the black communities, or the third world communities; that we're gonna have to organize to do something about it.  So the whole idea was to improve the number of blacks in journalism overall in America, to improve the treatment of those who had jobs, and to improve the coverage of the black community and the third world community, and we figured the only way to do this would be to organize and to challenge the industry of journalism, to go and confront them, you know, and demand these things because, you know, black folks read newspapers, black folks watch television, you know.  Black folks have got to be treated better than this, and plus, a lot of that information that they're putting out is, is distorted.  I mean I gave you two examples of it in my own career--the migrant camp [on Long Island, New York]; they write about the migrant camps without talking to the migrants, they write about South Africa--Soweto uprising--foreign news, and not talking to the Africans, you--so, I mean it, it's, it's, it's, it's an incredible oversight, which continues, by the way, and I think it still is one a the things that's usually wrong, you know, with the media in this country.
Story_ID: 361023
Speaker 1: So, just to--continuing to talk about NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], later years--a few years later, you also became the president.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was the fourth president; the first president was [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone, of course, and--I shouldn't say of course, but, but he was (laughter).  And the second one was [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett, and the third one was Bob Reid who was in television; he was the first television president we had, and I was the fourth president.  And, and we still had very much pioneering, aggressive--and two things usually was demanded; one--particularly in the early years, you wanted someone who was accomplished, you know, in the field.  You, you, you didn't want--you're gonna go talk to New York Times [The New York Times] about improving their coverage of the black community, you have to send someone who knew what journalism was, so that's why our early presidents were giants, you know, like I--up until they got to me, of course (laughter).  But, but, but the first three (laughter) were, you know, Chuck Stone and Vernon Jarrett, very aggressive, very smart, very courageous, very--also confrontational, you know, and, and that's what that group was about, and we challenged journalism--the, the institution of journalism, to get the numbers up, and now, you know, it's one of the largest journalism groups in the world; I mean it's--the membership is over four thousand.  It inspired the formation of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, there's the Asian American Journalists Association, there's also the National Association of Native American Journalists [Native American Journalists Association].  So we set off the organization of these other groups--ethnic groups, you know, to, to, to take care of their things and, and of course our interests are quite different, you know, but the whole idea is to challenge the institution of American journalism to be fair by people other than just white male American- white Americans period.
Story_ID: 361024
Speaker 1: So during that time, what was happening in your personal life?  Were you married with children at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was married [to Violet Payne], and still married with children (laughter).  I got married in 1966, so I was married just before I was shipped off to Vietnam; in fact, I tried to get a deferment, but they said, "No, no, you're going," (laughter).  I got a delay because my--you know, I--so I went to Vietnam in, in '67 [1967].  I was married in April of '66 [1966]; we have three children, and--
Speaker 1: Just quickly tell me when the children were born.  And their names.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the children was born in--I have a daughter, you know, who was born in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Tamara [Tamara Payne].  I have a son; our oldest son [Jamal Payne] was born in '72 [1972].  The interesting story about it--a interesting story in all this--he was born in '72 [1972]--
Speaker 1: But--yeah, give me the interesting story also, starting with your daughter, '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Well, the interesting story, the interesting story--well, the interesting story--it was a really interesting story on Jamal, but the interesting story on Tamara is simply that I was in the [U.S.] Army when she was born and, you know, I was trying to, to say, you know, I'm, you know, why send me to Vietnam; don't you have people without young children?
Story_ID: 350864
Speaker 1: Yeah, on, on Jamal [Jamal Payne].  What happened with Jamal is that when I went over to, to--first to Turkey, my wife [Violet Payne] was pregnant, you know, with our second child and--in fact, she visited us in, in Istanbul [Turkey] and we went on vacation and, you know, we went to Rome [Italy] and stuff.  And so she went back to the states, my wife did, and so we had a--and she was living with my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson] in Hartford [Connecticut]--pregnant and with our first child [Tamara Payne].  And so we set up a code; she was due to deliver, so we set up a code saying that when the--call me whenever--no matter--we didn't have cell phones back then (laughter), and international calls were not all that easy, but we say, if--when it's needed, give me a call and then I will fly black; I'd worked that out with Newsday, that I would report up until the time--and by the way, we were in France at that point.  We had finished the Turkish phase of 'The Heroin Trail' [Newsday Editors] story, and we were now living in, in France--in the South of France, and so the call--and, and I was in, in the Marseille [France] area and Bob Greene [Robert W. Greene], who was a team leader, was in Paris [France], and so he got the call, and so the call was, the baby is due.  And so Greene called me in Marseille and he said, "The baby is due," so I knew what that meant, so I got on the plane, flew to Paris, took a flight from Paris and went to New York [New York] and, and on to Connecticut where Jamal was born.  I, I missed his birth, by the way, by a couple of hours.
Story_ID: 350865
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, in France, what happened is that while we were investigating the heroin trade in the South of France, there was some previous government involvement, and connection, you know, because the history of smuggling in France go way, way, way back.  Most of the people who handle this drug smuggling of the heroin at that point, who had handled cigarette smuggling earlier, and God knows what they were smuggling way, way back, were the, were the Corsicans, all right?  For whatever, the Corsicans ran the, the underworld drug smuggling out of, out of France, and so--at any rate, so when, when I--when I flew up, the French connection--it involved--there was a group post-worl-, we won't get into all that, French group, but it was something called SAC, Service Action Civique [Service d'Action Civique], which is a French group that was government-connected and, you know, going back to World War II [WWII], and some of their members had had some involvement in the drug trade in the South of France.  So the French government--when we arrived, three reporters from Newsday who rent a house in the South of France, ostensibly to write about the drug trade, the French government--the French ambassador goes to the American ambassador and asks, you know, "Who are these guys?"  And they said, "Well, they are journalists."  And so--but they don't accept that; they think that we're a third force, they think that either we are the BNDD--now, BNDD was the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs; they're the forerunner of the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration].  So, they thought that we were a third force investigating something, so the French government was following us.  So here we were, three reporters from New York, investigating the heroin drug traffic; we're being followed by the French underworld headed by a man name Marcel Francisci, who is Corsican; he's--and his people are kind of onto us--they're following us around.  And the French government is following us around because they think that we were a third force, and they're trying to get something on the French government having to do with 'em.  So, so into this thing--we didn't know any of this at that point, and we didn't find--I didn't even find this out until later, but what happens, when Bob Greene [Robert W. Greene] (laughter) calls me with the word that, "The baby is due," the French government is sure that we've made some major disclosure having to do with the drug trade and possibly involving the French government, so they went to the American embassy and protested; they went to the American embassy and protested (laughter), you know, that, that, that we had this third force--that the U.S. government had this third force in their country without permission, and now they had made some major discovery, and one of their members has flied back to Washington [D.C.] with this disclosure (laughter), and they were trying to find out what it was, and what it was was the birth of Jamal [Jamal Payne] (laughter).  It was the birth of Jamal on October 5th of 1972--I'm sorry, 1974, that's what it was.  And as--we found out about the--some of it was real--I mean it was hilarious, it was hilarious.  But we did get the word from the government that the French government had protested, you know, that--when they heard--particularly when they heard this, this queue and they were wondering what we were up to (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The baby's coming.
Story_ID: 350866
Speaker 1: In the '80s [1980s], the early '80s [1980s], you were very critical of Ronald Reagan's [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] administration.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--jus-, can you talk about some of the things you wrote about, some of the things you discovered (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, I'll tell you why I was, I was--you know, I mean I grew up in America, and worse than that, or as bad as it get, you know--Alabama, so I mean I'm--you know, George Wallace, you know--the worst that you can think of I'm exposed to, so I--you know, crooked politicians are not new to me, racist politicians are not new to me, dangerous politicians are not new to me, oppressive politicians not new to me.  The thing that struck me about Ronald Reagan, I think--one a the reasons that I had a special kind of anger for him is that when he was shot by Hinckley [John Hinckley, Jr.], you know, he had been president--I think this is in '81 [1981], and Hinckley shot him--a man shot him outside of the White House [Washington, D.C.].  And I had talked to my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson] at about that time, and she said, "You know, you know," she said, "I hear Reagan had been shot."  And then she said, "You know," she said, "I don't know how to say this."  This is my mother.  And then I said, "Yeah, Ma, I know what you're gonna say."  And I didn't let her finish it.  What she was gonna say is that she hope he died.  Now, to me that is as bad as you get.  My mother, as me, are not shocked because we have a racist president; she's not shocked because the presidents steal, but there was something that she sensed about him; there's something that my mother sensed.  She, she, she--very good instincts.  She hadn't read anything about his background, hadn't read any biographies or--but something she sensed about him that said that he was particularly dangerous where black folks (unclear), and I kind of, I'm sure, picked that up from her, you know.  If my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Mae Payne] had said it, I mean I, I probably would have given--went down and gave Hinckley a medal (laughter), you know, because I mean I think that Ronald Reagan was one of the most dangerous modern presidents for, for African Americans because he was slick and because he was an actor because he was an empty suit, you know.  And, and I thought that--so I think a lot of my--and I, I mean this is kind of segueing into the column writing, but I mean I think the columnist writes out of his experience, and I write out of--everything that I've said to you I mean I, I write out of that; everything goes into it.
Story_ID: 350867
Speaker 1: You know, someone asked me the other day to write five--this person was giving a jobs fair and wanted me to write five pointers that I would give to young c-, not young, but college students who--you know, who coming into journalism.  So I wrote out, you know, the five points, and then this, this particular person, Stacey Walker is an editor--was her name, and she was impressed with 'em.  She said, "Oh, wow, you did 'em so quickly.  How long did it take you to write this?"  And I said, "Thirty-seven years," (laughter).  So I think that everything that one has lived goes into it, so I mean my view on, on, on Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], I think a columnist writes out of his experience.  I write out of Alabama; I mean the stories that you kind of evoked, you know, out of my experience, some of them I hadn't thought about in a while, go into every column I write, you know.  And, and I think that the thing with Reagan is that my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson] saw him as posing a particular danger, and it was a danger that a lot of people didn't see, and I think that after--particularly after he was injured, I think he got a free pass, and I'm speaking as an editor now because I--by this time, in 1980--I was named a national editor in 1980, so I began to be responsible for Newsday's White House coverage, and Washington, D.C. coverage.  We had--at that point, we had a nine-person bureau, which grew to a fourteen-person bureau, and so I was responsible for White House coverage, and I thought that--you may remember that when he ran--and she probably didn't know all of this, but when he opened his campaign, he opened it in Philadelphia,  Mississippi, and Philadelphia, Mississippi, to people who may not remember it, you know, is where this Emmett Till thing happened, you know, one of the most brutal lynchings.  It was, it was, it was--it's just transcendent lynching of my adolescence, and that's what these things are designed for; they are designed to create a chilling effect.  These are acts of terror.  Lynchings are, are, are thought-out, planned acts of terror that are designed to freeze yet another generation, particularly a black male, so that they won't get out of their place, so that they won't think that they are as smart or, you know, as wise as white folks, or think that they deserve the kind of job that white people--that's what these things were designed for.  And so, the one in my career that happened--1965, by the way, as you--I mean that was my formative years; I was fourteen years old in, in 1955 when Emmett Till was lynched, and his killers were in, in, in, you know, in the Philadelphia, Mississippi area, and--I mean pick it; I may have it wrong.  I don't know if it was Money [Mississippi]--I don't know if it was that one or the (unclear); I mean it may have been Schwerner [Michael Schwerner], Goodman [Andrew Goodman] and Chaney [James Chaney]--
Speaker 2: In Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Philadelphia, Mississippi, that's right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then Money, Mississippi may have been the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Money, Mississippi was Emmett Till.
Speaker 2: --Emmett Till.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 350868
Speaker 1: Schwerner [Michael Schwerner], Goodman [Andrew Goodman] and Chaney [James Chaney], their killings happened in Philadelphia, Mississippi, and when Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] launched his campaign for president in 1980, he launched it in Philadelphia, Mississippi, and I don't think without, you know--it was no coincidence, it was no accident, and I think that it, it just goes to the heart of the venomous--what he was trying to do was to tell Dixiecrats, who had previously been alive with the Democratic Party, that, there's room for you in the Republican Party. And he was trying to woo them, and I think he wooed them by making that statement by going there; that's how I read that, and I think our history should read it.  And so I think from the very inception, 1980, I began to, for my own, you know, reasons, see this guy as, as, as, as a, as a very dangerous threat, and my mother [Josephine Payne Johnson] had just simply--in one, in one level, verified and, and another level intensified, you know, my concern about the damage that this guy could do on the landscape--first of all, of African Americans in particular, you know, and the country in, in general.  And so--when I wrote about him, I wrote about him probably with more venom than I did, you know, with a lot of the politicians--
Story_ID: 350869
Speaker 1: I mean one of the things that I do in a column, by the way, is, is I break icons, you know.  I mean I, I attack powerful, highly thought-of, usually white, though not always white. Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton] and others have come in, you know--Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] included--figures who people idolize and therefore don't examine closely enough, particularly when they are married to power.  And so I mean I've written very strongly about the mayor of New York [New York], Koch [Edward Koch] in particular.  I mean we had--he was mayor for like twelve years, and for twelve years--for most of those twelve years, I mean we had at it hammer and tongue, you know.  I mean he would try to give as good as he got, you know, but I was on him, and I think that's the job of the journalist, is to keep politicians--or try to keep them honest, which is an impossible task.  I think the, the job of the columnist, you know, is to tell the truth as he sees it and, as for politicians, if, if you have something good to say about them, write another column (laughter).  But--no, Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] I, I, I--but Reagan and--I mean just pick a number; Reagan, Koch, you know, you know, Giuliani [Rudy Giuliani], I mean I think, I think these were all politicians who I think--or so-called servants of the people who don't realize that they're supposed to be servants of the people and I, and I think that they are misguided.  Bush--Bush is another one--President Bush [President George Walker Bush] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you also said that Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] had been given too much of a, of a--I don't know--free pass, or--
Speaker 1: Far too much of a free pass by, by black people.  I think black folks are--were--I mean my view is that I think black people were lulled to sleep by Clinton because he's a southerner, and I think that southern white men who've been dealing with black folks for the very, very long time, you know, going black to slavery--not individually, but their family.  I mean they have relate-, they, they, they have certain clues and queues as to how to deal with, with, with, with, with black folks in this country, and they have far more than immigrant people.  For instance, in New York, we don't have that problem; I mean Dukakis [Michael Dukakis] didn't understand Jesse Jackson but Strauss [Robert S. Strauss] understood him, you see. Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] understood Jesse Jackson, but Cuomo [Andrew Cuomo] did not.  See, Cuomo is an Italian; he just got off the boat.  His grandfather, you know, was born in Italy.  He doesn't know anything about this country.  Immigrants don't understand this country the way these southerners do in general, like Clinton--these people who've been here, you know, for three hundred years, you know, and that we've been dealing with from slavery.  When we talk about reparations and when we talk about slavery, I think we have to talk to the people, you know, who know about it, and I think that we can--and, and I don't think the immigrants--the people--you know, the Irish who came over here in 1840 should butt out of that conversation, all right?  I think that the, the Italians shouldn't even enter the conversation of reparation; they shouldn't even--they should recuse themselves because they don't know anything about it.  It, it, it pre-dates them, all right?  I think that Jews largely, you know, who came over whenever they came over from Russia and elsewhere, should, should not even enter that conversation; this conversation is a conversation that we African American, as former slaves, have had.  And I think Panamanians, you know, [HistoryMaker] Juan Williams and his crowd, should just butt out of this conversation; this conversation has nothing to do with Warren William to a degree that he doesn't accept this.  If he has problem, he should talk about it in Panama, you know, and, and, and that this conversation should car-, be carried on between African American-, the descendants of slaves, and those who were descendants of those who enslaved us.  And to those who--Johnny-Come-Latelies who simply benefit by the residue of that slavery, we c-, we have a different discussion with them, but not the reparation discussion.
Story_ID: 350870
Speaker 1: So, I think that black folks looked at--I mean the, the, the idea of Toni Morrison unfortunately, not jokingly saying that Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was the first black president, you know, is, is, I think, a slander, you know, onto--on, on, on, on our fore parents' history, you know.  I mean here's a guy who--I mean I know that--I think he is probably of Irish stock and probably not--maybe he shouldn't--he doesn't belong in on the conversation either, you know, but he sure as heck is, is in no way, I think--or--you know, he's a, he's a very smart man, and I think he has a southern entree to understanding the black condition; having been poor himself probably puts him closer than most presidents because most presidents don't come from the, the lower working class that he came from; they don't come from that side of town but, but I think that--I, I think that he was not able to do much good because he was limited as a black president, in some ways, would be limited for different reasons, you know.  So--yeah, I, I was, I was, I was, I was not particularly happy that, that, that we misread him and, and will misread his wife [Hillary Rodham Clinton], too, I'm sure, should she ever become president.  Who knows?  She might (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I'm just asking you to speculate but how do you think we'll misread his wife?
Speaker 1: Because I think we'll identify her with, her with him, you know.  Well, I mean we misread Reagan [President Ronald Reagan Wilson], too.  I mean I think--look, we did not, as a people, come this far this slowly by reading white people correctly.  I think we misread all of them, and I think we misread ourselves (laughter), too, and I, and I think--you know, the most damaging critique--and, and I, I don't write this strongly because it's--I think it's too painful, but I'll say it, and I don't think I--I haven't written it--I'll write it one day.  I think that if African Americans can find some way to overcome their psychic sense of inferiority, their crippling sense of self-loathing, I think the game is over.  However, I think that most of the black people that I meet, I would say 99 percent of them, have not overcome their sense of self-loathing, have not overcome their eth-, their, their psychic sense of inferiority, and I think that therein lies the problem.

Speaker 1: Well, you said Malcolm X had it.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: You said he had it and that's who taught it to you.  What was it he had that he taught to you that helped you overcome your psyche--?
Speaker 2: Well, well, you just hit on--I mean everything I probably believe in that's important having to do with, with the black condition, and that is what he realized is that he--when he was working with the Nation of Islam, given his experience, I think that he formulated how African Americans could convert themselves from people who had been descendants of slaves and find their rightful place in the sun, and I thought that he had the secret, he had the key.  And, and, and what it was, he did it--the way he did it was a sense of counter-rejection, all right?  In other words, I think this whole period of talking about the white man is the devil?  That was counter-rejecting the white man, and I think that he got over that period after he got out of the Nation of Islam, but I think if you looked at the way he lived his life, you know, and I know that his roots, too, on his mother's [Louise Norton Little] side were from Grenada and they had a somewhat different experience than those of us who have had, you know, in this country, but I think that on his father's [Earl Little] side coming out of Georgia--Malcolm's father coming out of Georgia, that he certainly--and, and I know he didn't--his father died when he was not quite six years old, you know, and he didn't spend a lot of time with him, you know, but I mean I think he still had his experience, you know, carried over, you know, in--into his lifestyle.  I think that he understood, through the process of counter-rejection, you know, that he could overcome this sense of self-loathing.  And I think that that's--if we can--if we could bottle that--if African America could bottle or learn--forget bottling--could simply learn what Malcolm taught, I think the game is over; it's as simple as that.  No one else, you know, has the answer.
Story_ID: 350872
Speaker 1: Right, but can you help me understand it again?  I mean I still don't--the counter-rejection.  So, Malcolm [Malcolm X]--you said he evolved after he left the Nation of Islam.  He was able to see--like how did he--I mean I, I, I'm still missing it.  I guess I'm in the 99 percent, but (laughter) I, I won't be after today, so--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, it's very simple.  I mean what you wanna do is very simple.  What you wanna do is to realize that you're a human being and that you're not inferior, it's as simple as that.  So how do you get there?  When you live in a country, when you have been born into a country where all of its might and all of its technology, and much of its science has been used to reinforce the notion that you're inferior--and make no mistake about it.  A, you have to realize that this country is fixed against the ambitions and, and--of, of, of African Americans, you know, the live-long day--generation X, Y and Z, and the one that comes after Z, all right?  And certainly in my generation.  So what he realized simply was that--he said the white man is a devil; now, that was the Nation of Islam's thing, but there was a way that he said and a way that he lived that.  He said that fearlessly.  There's a way to say it with fear and there's a way to say it fearlessly, and Malcolm said it fearlessly.  And I'm not too sure; I don't, I don't wanna comment at this point on, on Elijah Muhammad, whether he said it fearlessly or not, but I'm sure that Malcolm said it fearlessly.  And so, at the end of the day, he fairly accurately--well, first of all, he granted that the white--he--what did he say--the white man, white America, did not have our best interest at heart; he went beyond that, he said, white America has a--have our worst interests at heart.  In other words, they want to do the worst thing they can to us.  And if you realize that--see, most of us give whites the benefit of the--white America the benefit of the doubt.  They say, "Aw, you're exaggerating that," and they would say to Malcolm, "Aw, things are not that bad, you know; there's been progress, there have been improvements both in your personal life and in the overall life."  And I think where you wanna get to is that you, you grant them--you, you give them--you wanna get to a point where it's neutral, but to get to the point of neutrality, you have to first of all grant that all white folks are devils; you counter-reject them.  And then after you counter-reject them, you will arrive at a point where it doesn't matter anymore, you see?  But then you can say--see, if you say you are equal, it's not enough; you have to counter-reject 'em.  I mean it's, it's, it's, it's a way, I'm sure, that--it's the way people are programmed--it's the way people are de-programmed.  I'm no psychiatrist, but I will guarantee that if you were rejected by your parents and you were an orphan, and if you wanted to get over that psychic, that psychic damage, you know, that that causes, I think that you have to kind of counter-reject your parents for a while, and then you arrive at a point of equilibrium with your psyche where it doesn't matter that your parents rejected you, you see?  Now you have health, and now you can--you know, and, and they can continue to wish you harm.  Now, the, the trick is not so much to wish them harm or not; now, the trick is to figure out their game, to figure out why is it--and I think the thing, for instance, that even if all African Americans today in the--on April 10th of 2006 figured out--say all of us now magically, by the forces of the Lord, were to achieve an equilibrium psychically, so that racially we'd have no sense of superiority or inferiority, okay?  That's what you wanna achieve--balance.  You feel that you're a human being; you're not a Negro, you're not a nigger, you're not a kaffir, you're not white, you're, you're a, a--you're a human being, all right?  Look everyone directly into--in, in the eye.
Story_ID: 350873
Speaker 1: Malcolm [Malcolm X] used to--this is a digression, used to tell people, he said, he said, "I know you think that--," when he was trying to tell them how they could get from the sense of inferiority.  He said, "I know that you think that you, you think you're equal to the white man."  He said, "When you go to your job, look 'em--see if you can look 'em in the eye." Grown men used to walk back and they could not--they, they were surprised to find they couldn't look 'em in the eye.  All right now, getting back to the point.  Even if you arrive at a point of equilibrium, you still now--that's only the beginning but it's a big beginning; the game is over but in--at another level it's just begun.  Now, you have to find out the games that this person--this white America have been running against you.  You have to find out why is it that in this year, '06 [2006], for the decade before now and projected for the decade coming, twenty-nine out of every one hundred African American males will serve some time in state or federal prison.  You have to figure out what is it about this system that ensures that?  And then you have to counter it.  And you have to counter it in a proactive and even a preemptive way, see?  And then the work has just begun, but you can't even begun to do that work until you, until you gain a certain equilibrium because up until that--up until the point you gain a psychic equilibrium, you will not even be able to see that it's not what is the relationship betwe-, how much of it is your responsibility and how much of it is their responsibility.  Are they really--is it because we are criminals, or is it because the criminality that we perform, we get imprisoned a lot quicker for longer than whites who may commit, and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, you see?  And so--so that's, that's, that's just but one small indication of Malcolm.  I, I think he's the most--I mean I, I've written this; I wrote this once, you know, that I think that Malcolm, you know, was the greatest American of the latter half of the 20th century and I, I really believe that.  And I think when you add it up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you're writing it--
Speaker 1: And I, I don't mean black America, I mean America period (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You mean America period, yeah.  And you're writing--working on his biography, as we should (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I've seen nothing to contradict it.
Speaker 2: And when, when, when do you suspect you will complete the biography?
Speaker 1: Hopefully before you get this published (laughter).  When you got (laughter).  I don't even wanna set dates.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I've been working--I can certainly say that I've been working at it for more than a decade, and I--but I should say, though, that I haven't been working on it exclusively, you know.  I mean obviously I've, I've run national forum on health and science, I mean we've won five Pulitzers [Pulitzer Prize] in that period of time, I--you know, we've covered every major story that has happened almost anywhere on this planet, you know, I've, I've been involved with in some way, you know, since 1980 as an editor, and since 1969, you know, those limited stories that I did as a reporter [for Newsday].
Story_ID: 350874
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about most recently the journalist [Matthew McAllester] you sent to Iraq that--to cover the war--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the problems that they had--the journalist that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay.  On Iraq--I mean I was a deputy manager and editor for Newsday, and with that portfolio I was responsible for national news, foreign news, health and science, and city news.  And when the Iraq War happened, I was responsible for overseeing, you know, all coverage, and even before the Iraq War, I mean, of course 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  But--so, what happened is that we got permission from the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] to have six embedded reporters--six, which is a large number for a paper our size, and what I figured is that if we're gonna have six reporters embedded, which is a--with the, the [U.S.] military, then we've got to have six reporters who are not embedded in a war zone.  So we had twelve reporters in the war zone--twelve.
Story_ID: 350875
Speaker 1: So you have twelve journalists (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we had twelve, twelve journalists in, in, in the zone; six of them were embedded, six of them were not embedded.  And after--and we had covered Kandahar [Afghanistan]; I mean we had covered the Afghanistan campaign, you know, in the wake of 9/11 [September 11, 2001], you know--the movement that the U.S. had against the Taliban, and we had, you know, reporters going in and out of there during the whole period.  And when the invasion was imminent--all right, we had moved our people into position, and we got a letter from McAllester--Matt McAllester [Matthew McAllester], who requested--this is when--now, the day before the actual bombing began, Bush [President George Walker Bush], president, issued an edict that America should get out of Iraq, including journalists, all right?  And so they were beginning to clear out, and he said within forty-eight hours; this was from the White House.  During that period, I got a--we got a note from McAllester; we had--Matt McAllester and Moises Saman, his photographer--our photographer; they said, look, Bush has made his announcement.  Journalists are beginning to clear out.  We know that Chicago [Illinois]--Chicago owns Newsday (unclear) tribune own Newsday, a product on an issue and edict saying that all journalists should clear out.  He said, "We want to be allowed--we request permission for us to stay here in Baghdad [Iraq]," despite the fact that--or even if, you know, the--our country begin to bomb Iraq back to the Stone Age or into desert dust.  And so--now, I was the editor who was responsible for that as a deputy.  I went--I go into the edit--my position was that we should allow them to stay, but I had to go to the editor, Tony Marrow [Anthony Marrow], and I said, with a very strong recommendation; I mean I have some credibility in these matters because I'm the one who ran, and has run--had run for twenty-five years our foreign--I built essentially our foreign desk, which is one of my proudest contributions to the papers, the building of the foreign desk; Newsday has one of the best foreign desks, or has had, you know, in the country, you know, by recognition.  We won five Pulitzers [Pulitzer Prize], you know, on the foreign desk, on a very moderate size foreign desk.  But any rate--so I went to the editor and recommended that we be allowed--not that we be allowed, but that we grant them permission--our two young repor-, reporter and editor--that we grant them permission to stay in Baghdad, despite the fact that The Washington Post and New York Times [The New York Times] are headed for the border.  And so he said, "Wait a minute" (laughter).  So I said, "Okay."  We arranged a conference call with, with McAllester through a correspondent, and his concerns were, look, if you're gonna be in Iraq, you have three major concerns.  One is that America is gonna start bombing, and that's--everybody's in danger; we're concerned about that.  Number two is if America start bombing, the Iraqis gonna get pissed off at American corres-, all Americans who are there representing American newspapers, and they're gonna get ticked off and then you're endangered by the Iraqis, you know.  And, you know, just the whole idea of the coverage.  So, he said, "You know, this is, this is not--these are not ordinary times here, and we're responsible for you being over there."
Story_ID: 350876
Speaker 1: So, what Marrow [Anthony Marrow] wanted to know was that he really wanted to--he wanted to hear from him [Matthew McAllester] that he really wanted, you know, to stay there.  Now, the reason why I recommended it is--Tony would have let him stay on my recommendation.  The reason why I agreed to let them--this particular rea-, I would not have allowed any reporter, just any Newsday reporter, to stay there, but I allowed this particular reporter to stay there because he was battle-hardened; he had--I knew he could take care of himself.  He had been in a lot of tough situations--he had been to Northern Ireland, he had been shot at by the Israelis in the West Bank--machine gunfire; they'd backed him up when he was in a vehicle.  He had gone--he had been in Kandahar [Afghanistan], you know, and almost killed going into Afghanistan.  This particular reporter and the photographer [Moises Saman] also, had also covered the Bosnian War, you know, and he wrote a brilliant book about Pec [Kosovo], which is a community there, and going over the mountain ranges to get into this village, you know, in Bosnia to, to write about the--some of the--I mean to Kosovo, rather--Kosovo; and he wrote a, wrote a book called 'The Valley of the Damned' [sic. 'Beyond the Mountains of the Damned: The War Inside Kosovo,' Matthew McAllester], you know, about his experience and writing about a place called Pec, you know, Kosovo.  So he was very battle-hardened even though he's relatively young, you know, in his early thirties.  So I recommended that he stay there, knowing that there were dangers.  And--so then they disappeared, both of them.  We get a call from reporters that they are missing--that they were in their hotel and then they disappeared, and then at the end of the day, we assumed that they--we found out--the, the end--the, the, the story is that they had been arrested by the Mukhabarat, which is the secret police of Saddam Hussein; they knocked on the hotel door, confiscated their unauthorized computer, which they shouldn't have had--satellite phone.  Had a satellite phone which was on the same frequency, though they didn't know it, that the intelligence were operating on, which is one of the reasons why they detained but, you know, we didn't know that.  And so they, they arrested 'em and they put 'em in Abu Ghraib [Baghdad Central Prison, Abu Ghraib, Iraq]; they were in Abu Ghraib prison, America had lost, lost--started the invasion.  In fact, the bombs were falling in the courtyard of Abu Ghraib, the prison, and they were in there with other prisoners of Saddam Hussein, some of whom were--and the killing had started; they were beginning to kill--they were in there, you know, the, the political prisoners, and they had begun to kill some of them already, and it was very, very touch-and-go.  We had to set up a system here, and the editor--almost as if to say, "Okay, it's your show," (laughter).  So, I was given the responsibility to organize, for lack of a better word, the rescue mission.
Story_ID: 350877
Speaker 1: So I assembled, you know, three editors, you know, with skills and contacts, you know--the former foreign editor, Tim Phelps [Timothy M. Phelps], Dele Olojede, you know, who is the present foreign editor, and we began to work around the clock to send messages.  We talked, we talked to everyone; we contacted papal nuncio, you know, who had credibility in Baghdad [Iraq], to see if they could send messages through, and what we wanted to have is kind of a shock awe awe ourselves, so that we could let the Mukhabarat and, and Saddam Hussein's people know, despite the fact that the U.S. was bombing their country into desert dust, that we were concerned about them and that these were not any--that these were extraordinary journalists [Matthew McAllester and Moises Saman] and not just people that no one cared about, so we had to create a lot of commotion.  One lawyer in Washington [D.C.] told us, "The only way you're gonna get them out is you have to set up a campaign of motion and commotion," and that's what we began to do.  So we contacted the papal nuncio to send their emissaries there; they had an emissary in, in, in, in, in Baghdad.  We contacted Ramsey Clark who had good contacts, we contacted Yasser Arafat's Palestinian--Palestine authority, yes we did; contacted Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] (unclear) the family; we contacted Jesse Jackson, you know, to get in touch with him, and we contacted the Syrian embassy, you know, to see if they could get that person--Syrian intelligence to see if they could get someone in there.  So, we had these three--five, five separate vectors, you know, trying to get into Abu Ghraib [Baghdad Central Prison, Abu Ghraib, Iraq], and it's with motion and commotion, so we can let, you know, the Iraqi know that A, we were concerned about these and, you know, and that these folks, you know--and we were hoping that, that, that some of this would get through, and that--and we think that at the end of--they were held for eight days, and after eight days and, and one of the happiest days, you know, at, at Newsday, you know, we got this call, you know, that they had been released and they had--they were driven over land to the Syrian border and boom, you know, and they were out.  And he, he's written a book about it.  I mean--and so--I mean I think that's one of the side effects of being an editor and a manager, but also of being a leader.
Story_ID: 350878
Speaker 1: And I've got to say that leadership, you know, which we don't talk about a lot, or quantify hardly ever, I mean, I think is something that--I mean my view on leadership is that you, you're either born with it or not, you know.  I mean it's a quality that you have, and I remember when I was in--when we, we were doing our little light game--gang-fighting in Hartford [Connecticut]--we had some (unclear) what I would call jive gangs; we never had any big street gangs; I mean we had a little gang; we bought a jacket--I had a, had a--I was in a gang called the Dukes [ph.], and--you know, we weren't, we weren't much (laughter); we weren't much of a threat to anybody (laughter), you know, we just--it was like a club more than anything else.  But, but what I do know is that when a larger gang would come around, they would always assume that I was the leader and I've never said--I am not the leader, man, (laughter), I'm just here like everybody else.  They was just--man, they (unclear), man.  And so--but what leadership skills I had I, I remember I got a--I, I will say that they certainly were refined, you know, when I was in the [U.S.] Army, you know.  That's one of the, the, the challenges and, you know, that, that was afforded, you know.  I mean, you know, when I was in the, the [U.S.] military, I was a battery commander, you know, when I was in the military as a, as a lieutenant and then a captain.  I mean I was, I was a--when I was a Nike Battery Hercules--a Nike Hercules battery commander, I mean I contr-, I was commander of 138 men, which is the size of a Nike Hercules line unit, you know; I mean you're responsible for Nike Hercules batteries.  I mean these missiles--you know, you have about four missiles; these are huge, high altitude missiles that shoot down plane--bombers--incoming bombers and, and, you know, we're talking $25 million worth of equipment that you're responsible for as like a twenty-three, twenty-four year-old, and you also have a battery of 138 men that you're responsible for twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, you know, and so it's a huge responsibility that I was given, you know, at age twenty-three, twenty-four, you know.  And so that experience as a leader I'm talking about now, not just as someone who can report or write, but I mean the leadership; this is the kind of stuff.  And I was always, for whatever reason, you know, cited as someone who had, you know, leadership skills, both by the military, you know; I'm talking about West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] generals and everything, said, "This guy has," you know, "extraordinary leadership abilities."  And, and I think that I've tried to, I suppose, cultivate it in a way, you know, over time, but I think that, that, you know, a lot of--in the city room, a lot of what is not so apparent, you know, it, it is apparent what someone can write, it's usually apparent whether they can report, usually apparent even sometime whether they can manage because manage really is--you can teach someone to manage, you know; you have a budget, you know, in my case, you know, I have a budget, you know, at Newsday of $10 million, you know, then you manage that budget and make sure that if they tell you to cut it by 10 percent, you cut it by 10 percent and, you know, but you can be taught.  But leadership you can't be taught; you either have it or you don't.  And so I would, I would say that, that trying to get, you know, our two guys [Matthew McAllester and Moises Saman] out of Abu Ghraib [Baghdad Central Prison, Abu Ghraib, Iraq] after they've been or have, have been arrested by the Mukhabarat and held by Saddam Hussein's secret police, as America is bombing their country night and day, and they're writing for the American paper, I mean that's an (laughter) extraordinary challenge and, and obviously we had to have some luck, but you also had to have some organization; you have to have some sense of, you know, of, of--and that's where journalism really counts.  And it's important, not simply from a leadership point of view by any means, but it's important because what we were trying to do there is to get stories that the reporters that we had who were embedded could not get.
Story_ID: 350879
Speaker 1: We're trying to get stories [at Newsday] that reporters who work at the White House [Washington, D.C.] cannot get. We were trying to get stories that the Iraqis had, we were trying to get stories from the Iraqi community, you know, and it's, it's--we're right back to the migrant camp [on Long Island, New York], we're right to Soweto [South Africa], we're right back--this is the kind of thing that I think--we're right back to NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], we're right back to the riots, we're--one of the reasons why the, the Kerner Commission [National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders] report criticized journalism is because they did not have black reporters to go into South Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], South Chicago [South Side, Chicago, Illinois], North End of Hartford [Connecticut], Harlem [New York, New York], Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York], and talk to the community to see what they were thinking as they were being attacked by the police or the National Guard, or whatever--invaded by the, by the National Guard.  And so I think that is one of the great weaknesses of journalism, and I think that journalism can never really began to consider itself sufficient until it includes African American input specifically and more broadly than it include outsiders, and I think that one of the big problems and one of the major problems with journalism today is that it is covered by insiders.  In other words, if you--it's, it's springtime now, you know, and they have in Washington [D.C.] a luncheon in which--a dinner, rather, called the White House Correspondents' Dinner, in which all of those who--reporters who cover Washington bring a source--not a spouse or a date, but a, a, a, a source--a news source that they cover, and 1200 Washington-based reporters and 1200 sources kind of come together.  And on the one hand you can say, okay, that's just one night; this is not the way it normally works.  But the thing that I always notice about this and, and I've going since 1980 on and off, is that there're very few blacks, and usually some of the blacks that are there don't belong there, you know, because they're not White House-based reporters.  And you look at one of these White House briefings--those Pentagon briefings, and let me know how many black reporters do you see there, even now; even after, you know, we've organized NABJ.  Very, very few who ask key questions.  If you look at--I mean the Urban League [National Urban League] did a study and they looked at how many black news sources and/or journalists that appear on the Sunday talk shows--on the major ones, on the network one, on 'Face the Nation,' on NBC--I mean 'Face the Nation'--on 'Meet the Press,' all right?  Very, very, very few, you know, and 80, 85 percent of them are all white, all right?  And you say, "Well, people who make news, why," even though--and the, and the, and the blacks that you have on the--granted, Condoleezza Rice is on and, and Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] was on when he was secretary of state, and then you get [HistoryMaker] Juan Williams--usually--is the other one.  I mean I'm not saying this jokingly, but he's the other guy, and there's nothing wrong; I, I don't wanna criticize Juan by any means, but I mean it should be much broader than that.  And so what happens is that--to get it--to get back to the situation where you have twenty-four White House correspondents or Washington-based correspondents, 1200 of them correspondents and 1200 of them the news, news sources, when you look at them, aside from seeing not that many blacks, but what you see is that they're drawn from the same sources.  The government people come from the same neighborhoods, same exclusive neighborhoods as the people who cover them, they go to the same schools, they eat at the same expense-paid restaurants, they use the same blow dryers, and so you have a press and a media, which--and this is something that they never talk about because they would have to admit it, is that they're in (unclear), covering in (unclear), which is why I think we missed the war [Iraq War], which is why I don't think they are sufficiently critical of the president, or analytical of the president, and I think that it's a, it's a, it's a huge problem that I think needs to be fixed, and I think that African America is but one solution to it.
Story_ID: 350880
Speaker 1: So, when you think about all that you've been able to do, and as you sit in semi-retirement, what do you look forward--what do you think is next for you?  Seeing where you've been, where you are now, where do you think you're going?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I said earlier that, you know, one of my statements that I like is that, that one should achieve immortality before one dies and, and I think that you can do it in a number of ways.  Someone said once that, you know, that--there was an old song used to say that--as I don't remember the words exactly--something--only thing a man should do is, is take a wife, plant a tree, and give the world a son.  And I think that that's the way of achieving immortality, too, you know, through your children, by planting a tree, you know?  But I think that--to, to your question, I think is--your work is what makes you immortal, you know and, and I like to think that, to the degree that I've achieved immortality, aside from DNA, you know, with three children that my wife [Violet Payne] and I share, is through, through the work and, and I think what I wanna do for the rest of my life I'm gonna--you know, the days I have left, is to--I mean I've written, God knows, probably upwards of 2 million words, you know, that have been published, you know, both in newspapers and hardcovers and, and, and I wanna--I'm thinking more about putting--about writing books, which I think have a permanency, at least until now--before Internet steps in--and, and eBay and (laughter) begin to, to, to, to, to destroy that market as well but, but I, I think I'll, I'll--I wanna write for hardcovers, you know, or finish the Malcolm [Malcolm X] book, and I have some memoirs that I'll probably do--memoir-type bio-, auto-biographical things that I want down.  And I think the--and, and I also wanna work with the next--the coming generations; I should say continue to work with the coming generation because that's what NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] was all about; it was about the coming generation.  We didn't organize NABJ for ourselves; I mean we organized it for the generation that were coming behind us and, you know, I, I also organize the Trotter Group, which is a--we organize the--a group of black columnists, I mean African American columnists--opinion writers; and the whole idea was to find out how you can improve--increase, you know, the visibility of blacks on those Sunday talk shows, how you can write black commentary that is fearless, that is authentic, that is courageous.  Unfortunately, most of it is not, you know, and then most of it is not--you know why?  Because, you know, too high a percentage of people are still waddling in self-loathing, and still think that--and if they don't think it, or they wouldn't admit it, I think they feel it, you know, a sense of psychic inferiority or insecurity, vis-a-vis white Americans which, I think, is rather obscene, you know.  That's why I think that the whole idea is to try to find some formulation, you know, where common gener-, coming generation of African Americans, you know, can move into the fullness of the health that was taken from them when they were brought here in chains all of those centuries ago.

Speaker 1: So, very last question, why did you agree to become a HistoryMaker with us?  I mean why did you agree to the oral history, this interview, why, why do you feel history is important?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I checked the organization out and, and it seemed to me that it looks like an, an, an earnest attempt to preserve for scholars and for, you know, students, and for citizens that are interested in the lives of, of people that you've selected, you know, to, to preserve that, and to get some sense of their backgrounds, to get some sense of their thinking, to get some sense of, of their beginnings and, and I think that's, that's an honest kind of thing and, and, and what impressed me quite beyond--after looking into the group, what impressed me beyond quite that is that I noticed that, you know, you tend to try to get people who ordinarily would be overlooked and, and I don't--I'm not saying that I feel overlooked particularly, you know, but I think that--I do notice that there is an overwhelming kind of concentration, you know, of almost, you know, I mean every ti-, when I was a young reporter, I noticed that every time a gypsy moth would fall on a white person's lawn, Newsday would be there with two reporters and a photographer, and yet, you know, when the same gypsy moth fell on our lawn, nobody was there, so I said, well, you have to correct that.  So I, I, I al--I'm a sucker for, for people who try to correct wrongs, and I think that in some important way perhaps, I think that what you're doing is trying to, to fill in, you know, some of those gaps here that I've concerned a good deal of my life with--concerning my professional life.
