Speaker 2: I guess first of all she was a good child and she wanted to have a family.  She had that family, and she wanted to make sure that all the children were in school or went to school, and they were taking care of themselves and family and friends and so forth, but nevertheless such, she made sure that they were in school being educated as one should be at that particular age and coming out to live or get things that--and going to a school where she would have liked them, for them to go, maybe the one that she may have gone to.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.  Did she ever share any stories with you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really, but she cared--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about you and made sure that there were, say, things that we should learn about and in which we did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, thank you--
Story_ID: 360381
Speaker 1: All right, we've just finished talking about your mother [Annie King Toler].  Could you please tell us about your father, what was his name?
Speaker 2: My dad was a Pullman porter and of course, we loved that because we were able to get an extra bunk because of his job that he had, he was a Pullman porter and he, worked hard and I would say, worked with people, for people, and then he did a good job because he was able to retire.  He always would make a buck [dollar] on his, say, responsibilities for his--taking care of folks who might be on a trip to go here, go there, but nevertheless this type of thing here, you know, is something that he enjoyed.  He retired from that.  He got us through school and as a Pullman porter.  And he was happy with what he may have done.
Speaker 1: Okay, could you, could you tell us his name?
Speaker 2: Arnold W. Toler, A.W. Toler [Arnold Toler, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he ever give you--share any stories about being a Pullman porter?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, in fact I have a variety.  I have--he would have a vacancy, I would say.  He would have a vacancy where he could bring in his child because as a Pullman, that's his job to take care of folks, and so we were taken care of when we had a chance to, in one of his unused, I would say, I'd like to say in my other words he would live in a Pullman.  I came from San Francisco [California] to Memphis [Tennessee] in a Pullman quarter, this, I'd say Pullman, and I was able to have a nice bed from there to California, back from California to Memphis, Tennessee--Pullman car, you know, Pullman car where they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --made places for people to sleep--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and enjoy--
Speaker 1: Oh, that must have been.
Speaker 2: --at a very young age.
Speaker 1: Yes, that must have been a delightful trip, lucky you, wow.
Story_ID: 360382
Speaker 1: --Do you know anything about your family's background, your ancestors, your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  My grandfather [David King] had a farm, her, say, father (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You mean your maternal grandfather.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, and so every summer we would go from Memphis [Tennessee], from Memphis to Mississippi and stay on the farm for six weeks or for a time that we could help him, or, where we would learn to do things and take care of things.
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy it?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, we did.  And we had a train to take us to there and he would--it didn't cost anything because my grand- my father [Arnold Toler, Sr.] was in charge, he was a Pullman porter as I said, and there was an empty, say bed, or we slept in a bed and didn't just sit up there for all night long.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your grandfather's name?  That's okay.
Speaker 2: Papa, papa, I called him papa.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's wonderful.
Speaker 2: I know his name too.  He was the man in charge of the whole family of course, and he had four children, and so we were able to, of course, live there with them during the summer.  So I will say yes, Mr. King, his name was King, and of course, he was the king on his farm, you know, he took care of things and taught me things that I didn't know about.  He would let me experience things.  He kept me and helped me to move along, and of course, I--it's something nice like that to have at your hand, you know, you go and do things and take care of things as you would like to, and he was there to support it and then to make us behave and do things as they should be done.  So you learned from the very beginning through my parents and grandparents, of course, and this is something I would receive early on.
Speaker 1: Okay, you never thought about being a farmer though?
Speaker 2: During the summer I was.  We were there on vacation.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So you want to find out what goes on then?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We had that type of information to do it because we had to do it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Milking cows and things like that, we--some picking cotton, hay and all that stuff.  We did all of that.
Speaker 1: You did, oh my.
Story_ID: 360383
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're going to talk a little bit about you, okay.  So, what I'd like to know is, what's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, in growing up a Toler we knew we had someone who loved us and could show us the way.  Who--I could make a--if you wanted to go for a walk, we would walk with him.  If we wanted to go to the farm, they would go with us, get us started, you know, cared about what we did and how we would--may have done it and so he said that you know, he was a caring parent and we were so happy and we enjoyed doing it, you know, from city to country you know, like Memphis [Tennessee] was city, we went to school.  We didn't have an (unclear), we did as far as picking cotton.  They would have a truck come if you wanted to go there to pick some cotton and they'd pay you for it of course, what you had picked, how much you have picked, but nevertheless it was well taken care of.  We really appreciated it.  I don't mind going to, to the country now, but not to work though.
Story_ID: 360384
Speaker 1: All right, so you went to the country when you were a little boy.  When you were home with your parents [Annie King Toler and Arnold Toler, Sr.], when you were home with your parents--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what was your home, your family life like back in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well they would show you in the first grade and what things you had to do and for sure we did them because my mother was a teacher too.  She made certain that we were taken care of, away from home as well at home, but you know, they made sure that you learned your ABCs and so forth as one would have or have an opportunity to take advantage of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any little chores to do when you were a little boy?
Speaker 2: We made our own toys in a sense too, you know, we, if it was a ball or we would roll it, and again, just get the material, we would ask for it, or if you wanted to get something and we'd get it for balls or whatever it may have been.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know you have brothers and sisters, your siblings.  Could you tell us their names and their birth order and maybe something about them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had to say, one sister and there was three boys, and one girl, and of course, our mother wanted the very best for us all.  We needed a ball to play ball, they would try and get one for you, and the sister, they had good friends and cousins around, so they were there with one another at one time, at one time or another during the course of the year, month.
Speaker 1: Okay, could you tell us your brothers' names?
Speaker 2: Arnold [Arnold Toler, Jr.], Burl [sic. David Toler] and Gwen [Gwendolyn Toler].
Speaker 1: Okay, and your sister's name?
Speaker 2: Gwen.
Speaker 1: Gwen, Gwen, okay.  Do you want to tell us anything about them?
Speaker 2: Well, they all had an opportunity to be dealt with by parents who cared, and of course we--they all went to school, and they were able to go to school to learn things that they should learn, and so they all came out, you know, as they had hoped to, and so the parents were there at all times to look at this as something we must do now, and we did it because they cared about what we do and how our mother and father did--go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, did, when they grew up what occupations did they have?
Speaker 2: Teachers, we had Pullman porters, and my dad, my dad, my dad was a Pullman, and so we had those things too--and then also school.  "You're going to school my friend, whether you like it or not."  That's how I ended up in San Francisco [California], you know, because my uncle [Louis C. King], her brother, lived in San Francisco, and when I finished grade school, I went on vacation out there because my dad could get free tickets, and then of course, my uncle, he lived in California, he said, "When you finish high school you can come out here and go to school," and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Oh, good for you.  You, you lived in Memphis.  Could you tell us the street, something about the street you lived on, your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Woodlawn Street, it was a good area that I lived in.  My parents were teachers and they built the foundation, another thing you had business people and so forth and we were surrounded by people who cared about us, they knew us and we knew them.  And you behaved themselves because they didn't mind telling the parents about their--what a kid may have done.  So you think in terms of that type of thing, and you think in terms of how they felt about us.  We behaved, if someone was doing wrong on the street, the parents would leave the home and go outside and say, "I'm going to tell your father and your mother."  And we really and truly behaved ourselves.
Speaker 1: Was it a black neighborhood that you grew up in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah it was a black neighborhood, but maybe it took on, had blocks of white folks took on and went out there, but we were in a black neighborhood.
Story_ID: 360385
Speaker 1: Are there any sights, or sounds, or smells that when you come into contact with them they immediately take you back to childhood?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  We didn't tolerate some things that they were doing.  We made sure that the parents or the person who lived there would (unclear) keep--take his (unclear) claim it.  If something needed to be done we would--kept together and make sure these things are moved out because it's something that we don't like and we're not going to grow up doing this.  So they took care about us and we cared about them and they took care of things and improved the community which they lived in if they could.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.  Are there any other memories you have of growing up, is there anything else you'd like to tell us about your childhood?
Speaker 2: I guess there is one thing that my uncles and my mother [Annie King Toler] and father [Arnold Toler, Sr.] cared about us.  My grandparents cared about us.  You go one to another they made sure that you behaved yourself and do the things that you should do.  We didn't say, "Oh, that's someone else's boy or girl," we did, just friends who lived there.  We wouldn't let them just do any old thing, you know, we made sure that they can learn like we can.  My mother was a schoolteacher and you had to go to school, and don't come through here and play hooky in front of my house, you know, knowing that you should be in school. The parents, mother didn't mind telling your mother or your father that you didn't go to school, don't you do it again and so forth and so and so.  We had those kind of things happening to us, that someone said, play hooky, not today my friend because mom and father is here and then uncles and friends who lived in the area [in Memphis, Tennessee], but nevertheless it was just so nicely done.  They cared about us and we cared about them.  One hand washes the other.
Story_ID: 360386
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about your schooling.  You went to--of course you started in elementary school.  Could you tell us something about your elementary school days?
Speaker 2: Well actually as I said, that we had teachers who cared about the schooling of the kids.  And they weren't afraid to tell the parents what may have happened, what should happen, and we had help from the homes as well as from the schools and the teachers who taught school of course, but we had people who cared about us and we cared about them.  We had no choice to say that--you had to go to school and we went to school, or you might, if you do something you shouldn't you might get a spanking, but nevertheless we had a good community [in Memphis, Tennessee], a good community and people who cared about us as people.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite grade in school?
Speaker 2: Believe it or not I was good in math.
Speaker 1: Pardon?
Speaker 2: Mathematics.
Speaker 1: Mathematics.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  But then, you know, I didn't know what it was all about, but it was something we had to learn, and we learned.
Story_ID: 360387
Speaker 1: I'm just going to back up a teeny bit.  I made a big mistake.  When we were slating and saying, you know, where we were, and you said the address of where we were, but we forgot to mention that we are in the home of your very good friend, Ms. Ruth Burrows [sic.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And Dr. Bancroft [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft].
Speaker 1: --and Dr. Bancroft, okay (laughter).  My gosh, I'm losing my mind here.  Okay, and she's over here at the side, so, and she's going to be making editorial--she's going to be making (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Get up close so you don't miss anything.
Speaker 1: Right, she doesn't want to miss anything, so she's going--she, might make some comments every once in a while.  I'm just going to back up a teeny, teeny bit.  You had mentioned that your mother [Annie King Toler] had gone to a teachers college in Mississippi and it was at Jackson State College [Jackson College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Jackson State College.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that your papa, your grandfather--
Speaker 2: Farmer, he was a farmer.
Speaker 1: --his name was David King, okay.  So is there anything else you want to tell us about them?
Speaker 2: Well every year when school was out we would go to the country and we would, and this was something he wanted us to have, or do every year, and so of course, we went during the summer.  I learned to pick cotton and chop cotton or bale hay, all those things I learned, but getting to school was a thing, something he would not let you miss because it's important and they taught from the very beginning how we felt about how although we were farmers, but you are going to go--I went to, I went as I say, he knows the importance of it and this is something that happened.  He took care of that; you're in both city and country (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 360388
Speaker 1: Before we took a short break, you were talking about your elementary school days.  And that you went to school in Memphis [Tennessee].  What kind of a student were you?  Were you a studious kid?  Did you get into trouble (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, actually I passed the classes and I had a decent record of passing you know, because this is something that my parents [Annie King Toler and Arnold Toler, Sr.] made certain that you took advantage of and we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you a well-mannered child?  Were you rambunctious?  Did you like to play jokes?
Speaker 2: You went to school to learn something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you can't learn when you're not behaving and taking advantage of the opportunity that you have.  And my mother was a teacher and taught courses and said, "You're going to school, you know, you're not going to go here and get a job in between, or you'll be getting married and you haven't finished high school."  My point is that they were very concerned about where we had gone to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And just like out here [San Francisco, California], you know, I was just finished high school and my mother made certain that I came out here and my uncle [Louis C. King] out here who lived here made sure that I went to school and took advantage of that opportunity--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I did.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  He was known as Honest Abe [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.].
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: He was, Burl was Honest Abe.  Why?  Why were you Honest Abe?
Speaker 2: Well, actually you know, it was like anything else.  Any wrong you see, make sure you try to right it in some way or another by your friends or someone who lived there.  So I made certain that I behaved myself, and I expected my friends to behave themselves because it was so important and they all took advantage of that and here we are.
Speaker 1: I know this is kind of early in your life, but quite often little kids think, oh, when I grow up I want to be--when you were little, did you have any idea, any thoughts about what you wanted to be when you grew up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother being a teacher you know, I never wondered what her first concern would be; make sure you start going to school, behave yourself and do your very best, and your best will be good enough and--
Speaker 1: Okay, but what did you want to be?
Speaker 2: Well, you--
Speaker 1: What did you think you were going to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Not really knowing, but I know what I had been given by the teachers I had to learn because what happened, you know, you can fit this type of thing into a lot of things you had to behave yourself, and learn your ABCs, your times tables and those kinds of things, you know, we had to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, you can't do that you had to sit down, and before you get up from that chair, you won't be doing that.
Story_ID: 360389
Speaker 1: Did your family attend church?  Was church important to your life (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Every Sunday, yes, my mother [Annie King Toler]--yes, yes.  My mother was involved on the usher board and all.  It was something, my mother was there and so I had to go to school and while there, I'm in church, and while there I had to behave myself too.  And like I say, behaving is not too bad after all.
Speaker 1: Was it a Baptist church?
Speaker 2: A Baptist church.
Speaker 1: A Baptist church.  Were you in the church choir?  Did you go to Sunday school?
Speaker 2: No I didn't--I went to Sunday school, I went to Sunday school, and I know, I wasn't in the choir.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  You went to BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union of America] too.
Speaker 2: What babe?
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  You went to BYPU.
Speaker 2: BYPU, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: BYP, what's that?
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Young (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  B-Y--
Speaker 1: But yeah, you know, BYPU, in other words you had someone there looking at the youngsters (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --and behaving themselves and taking care of--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  It was in the afternoon after church.
Speaker 2: After church, so you went back to--
Speaker 1: The afternoon, correct.
Speaker 2: --the youth group after church.  Did your family--they just went on Sundays.  They'd go back Wednesday nights?
Speaker 1: It depends on what their assignment was, you know.  They allowed themselves to do the things that they had to do and we had to do them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  Ms. Toler was the lead usher.
Speaker 2: BYPU, oh yes, oh yes, she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your mother was the lead usher at the church?
Speaker 2: For the church, yes, and we had to behave ourselves, of course.
Speaker 1: I'm sure you did if she was the lead usher.  I bet you were sitting still, okay (laughter).  So you--when you were growing up were there any very important people in your lives, your family, or any neighbors that were important to you?
Speaker 2: They knew what the parents wanted from us, and they would see people not doing as they should do.  The parents would know about it, and of course it would stop.  My point is that we had people in the neighborhood [in Memphis, Tennessee] who believed in what we thought, teachers across the street lived, and so outside you better behave yourself, or your mother or your father would hear about it and you might get a spanking.
Story_ID: 360390
Speaker 1: You had mentioned that your uncle [Louis C. King] was very influential in your life because after you left elementary school you--did you stay to go to high school in Tennessee, or did you move someplace else?
Speaker 2: I finished high school in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: In Tennessee, okay.  What do you--can you tell us about your high school years?
Speaker 2: Let's say that the, the school was like something that we had to do we'd started at the--my school, I forgot my school name, but, Lemoyne [LeMoyne College; LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee], Lemoyne, Lemoyne, school, college.  And we had the opportunity to go there and spend some time there and--because they taught us.  And then came to California after that and everything fell into place.  But they cared about you at home as well as being away from home.  You had an opportunity to do something at home, you did it as well as when you were away.
Speaker 1: Your high school in Tennessee, was it an all-black school?
Speaker 2: No--yes.
Speaker 1: It was.
Speaker 2: Manassas High School [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you play football in high school?
Speaker 2: Not in high school, but coming to California and having people who cared about you as a person, they said, "You have to do this."  I mean, just like PE, physical education, would be something we had to take and we started doing things that we enjoyed doing, and here we are.  And then being able to earn a scholarship all the way through college is not bad.
Speaker 1: No it's not.
Speaker 2: Out here.
Speaker 1: When you were in high school in Tennessee, what did you and your teenage friends do?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well, first of all as I said, my mother [Annie King Toler] taught school.  She expected you, if you were going to a school and what it was for and you should put forth the things and do the things that they asked you to do, and no back talking.  They made sure.  And we didn't do any back talking, you know, and they made sure, and we didn't do any back talking.  They cared about you as a person, of course they--if the teachers take care of you, sure the parents would also.
Speaker 1: Right.  Who were your friends in high school--in Tennessee?  Do you remember any?
Speaker 2: They were good.
Speaker 1: You knew (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were very good because they were consistent in how they behaved; like there were teachers all over the place who made sure that you behaved yourself and do things as they should be done.
Speaker 1: What about your childhood, your friends at high school, your boyfriends and girlfriends?
Speaker 2: No girlfriends.
Speaker 1: No girlfriends.
Speaker 2: My friends, I, no, I didn't, I didn't start the big stuff.
Speaker 1: Oh you didn't get the big stuff yet?
Speaker 2: Oh we had--my people made me go to a prom, you know, one of my teachers said, "You're going to go," and sure.  I had to get a suit on and then I had to go to--take this young lady--they may sit down--you go with him now, this, this is your time out.  So we had to--went to our proms, and the teachers were right there with me, and as they'd say, "Now you go home now.  We'll take you first," the baby home--the girl home first and then brought the boy.  You know, my point is that everything was organized.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And we didn't try to take anything out there and then with the others and being yourself.
Speaker 1: Did you have some boyhood good friends?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about them?
Speaker 2: Well they were boyfriends that lived within the community.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  John [ph.].
Speaker 2: What babe?
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  Your friend John.
Speaker 2: Oh John, yeah.  You know, they were good friends of ours, you know, and John, I cared--my buddy John.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  Came to California--
Speaker 2: California.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  --the first time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did!
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: You came on the train or on the bus?
Speaker 2: The train, train, my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of course.
Speaker 2: --my father [Arnold Toler, Sr.] was a Pullman porter--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so that's how we got out there.
Story_ID: 360391
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're going to just back up a little bit.  You graduated from high school from Manassas High School in Memphis [Tennessee] and you decided to go on to college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My--
Speaker 1: --to a small college in town, and what was the name--
Speaker 2: Well I came to San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the college in Memphis, Lamont?
Speaker 2: LeMoyne [LeMoyne College; LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: LeMoyne.
Speaker 2: LeMoyne.
Speaker 1: LeMoyne College.  Why did you want to go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, you have parents [Annie King Toler and Arnold Toler, Sr.] talking about school and you find out what they do there and then my mother--they made sure that they know where I'm there, why I'm there, to be getting an education, and things became easy as far as being able to handle it because they knew that somebody's watching everything that I do, or every move that I made, so I came out here and knew that it was for a purpose.
Speaker 1: Okay, where did--when you were young and you were just starting in college, what did you think you wanted to be?  What--why were you going there?
Speaker 2: Well, at the beginning you know, you don't know your way around, but again sometimes you might have an idea too, as far saying, being this, or being that, but first of all you know, it's PE [physical education], we were just jumping around having fun, you know, and so of course, someone said, you should do this, or one of the teachers said that, you know, you're here for a purpose, and put forth that effort.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So engineer, you know, I started, I was going to be an engineer.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were going to be an engineer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wanted to be, but again to they didn't have that, what I wanted, so what happened, I mean, see, I didn't come out and say this is what I want to be, but you're going to school and you're going to school to take advantage of the opportunities.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  Or to get into--
Speaker 2: Pardon, okay.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  His mother sent him out here because he had taken a job at a hotel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, oh well that's my (unclear), baby.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  No, you were--
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  --no you were working at George Peabody [Peabody Hotel, Memphis, Tennessee]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I said, baby--
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  --while you were in school, but it was in summer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what--
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  You put your age up.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  Now tell her what happened, and why you--
Speaker 2: What happened when I went home and I, you know, I liked to do my job good, well, and then I, we had a very good night, you know, as far as for busboys and waiters, but anyway we had nice tips from the people that were there for service, and so I went home and I told my mother that I made $110 (laughter).
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  You gave it to her, showed it to her.
Speaker 2: Oh my heavens.
Story_ID: 360392
Speaker 1: To make a long story short, my mother [Annie King Toler] said, "You giving that job up," you know, she knew how (laughter)--and the next thing was, I was out here, you know, I was in San Francisco [California].
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  She sent him to his uncle (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To his uncle--and what was your uncle's name?
Speaker 2: And I had--King.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  Louis--
Speaker 2: Louis C. King, he was in business out here.
Speaker 1: So how--he had already come to San Francisco and he had a business?  What was his business?
Speaker 2: I guess he had bought a little hotel and restaurant, you know.  He was into the business.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  He had a liquor store.
Speaker 1: Liquor store.
Speaker 2: A liquor store.
Speaker 1: And I worked there to him.  My point is that it, you know, they really put it on me in a sense as far as saying you're going to do this or do that; you're going to take care of yourself and, but first of all you're going to go to school.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Uncle Louis lived in Oakland [California]--Berkeley [California], but he had his business in Oakland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  And he put him to work.
Speaker 1: And I had somebody, he was good, he--but no, no, you had to have a job to do and you'd do it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You did it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were working in your uncle's liquor store in Oakland and going to school at City College in San Francisco [City College of San Francisco, San Francisco, California], okay.  What was--what were you studying?  What was your major?
Speaker 1: I was in engineering and then I changed that and got my bachelor's [degree] and so forth, in education.
Speaker 2: Okay, but then you were taking PE [physical education] classes and your life--it changed your life.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it did.  And then they told me, said, you know, seriously you know--things I started doing and you know, it was like, you out to play football, you played football.  You out to track, you track, you're a track star, it's track, you know a person will be starting doing things, but, most of all do things to the best of your ability and your best will be good enough.  That's the way I looked on it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You started out on the boxing team?
Speaker 1: Oh box- oh yeah.  You know, that's what I'm saying, I boxed--I didn't care, you know, just again, one day we had our boxing, and I, you know, I had a good punch, and again too, I got blood, and then so of course, I'd say--my mother and all said, you're going to take another interest, you know, if you like that, you can take care of yourself.  And again to that's something that I thought in terms of whatever I do, or would do, it would be to the best of my ability and so far it was to the best of my ability.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were a good boxer, and the boxing coach said, "I think you should try out for the football team"?
Speaker 1: Yeah, football team, which I did you know, I got into it, just, run, I ran of course, and I took advantage of every opportunity I had.  So again, and then, then he said, "Why don't you go out for football?"  I never played in high school [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee], in high school to speak of, but again I started playing football and before you knew it I was on the team and that year I guess, I became an All-American in JC [junior college], I mean it was community college.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And then they moved me on to, then to USF [University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California].  They wanted me to play football there with them, and I did on a scholarship.  For the next five years I didn't pay a cent for anything because I was on a scholarship.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's wonderful.
Speaker 1: So several things--so many things happened, that's one of them, that they wanted me to be there and I wanted to be there and then I got a place to stay and they fed me year round.  And during summertime I used to do some work or go back to my barracks and take advantage of them because I'm there for the whole year.
Speaker 2: You mean your dormitory?  Were you in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 1: Yeah, dormitory, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, all right.  Can you describe the City College of San Francisco when you were there?  Were there a lot of black students there?  Was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not a hell of a lot.
Speaker 2: --predominately white?
Speaker 1: Not a hell of a lot, you know, it was just like anything else at that time.  Kids just began to start doing things that they should do and they might see you doing something and then say, "Why can't I do it too?"  Given the opportunity, you can do it.
Story_ID: 360393
Speaker 1: You came from Tennessee to Oakland [California].  That must have been a big change.  What was Oakland like in those--when you first arrived (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a nice place.  We had, you know, we had a good--Oakland was good.
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2: My uncle [Louis C. King] was--lived in Oakland of course, and we had a place to stay, and I started working in his drugstore or his--and so I had a job, you know, and I stayed there, you know, and of course I didn't have to tell him because he knew what I had to do and I did it.
Speaker 1: Okay, this was like in the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s] when you first came?
Speaker 2: I was here--
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  You also participated in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What baby?
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  --I was going to say you participated in events through the DeFremery Recreation [DeFremery Recreation Center, Oakland, California].
Speaker 2: The DeFremery.
Speaker 1: Oh, the DeFremery.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the DeFremery.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Over in West Oakland [Oakland, California].
Speaker 1: You know, then I--
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Dorothy Pitts was the director and he was one of their--what do you call it?  She wrote a book, and she showed pictures of people at different times who were there, and he was one of the people who was active at that, that was his outlet, his recreation in sports after he was in Oakland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have it--do you want to tell us any more about the recreation center?
Speaker 2: It just--it just seemed to be you know, a fight or at this playground and I'd be--had sports across, the opposite side of the games, and I just put forth my best effort whether I was playing basketball or football, whatever and I would say, be going there to have a game or play a game of football or to whatever we were doing and everybody wanted me to be on their team because you know, it's like anything else, you put forth your best efforts and your best efforts end up being the best thing that could happen, that could happen to you now.  And that's something they realized too that you put forth your best effort, and you can make it, things happen.
Story_ID: 360394
Speaker 1: You're living in Oakland [California] with your uncle [Louis C. King] and you're at the community center, and you start taking classes at City College [City College of San Francisco, San Francisco, California] in engineering and then you get into sports.  And you're on a very, very special football team, 1951, right?
Speaker 2: You know it's like, you know, you're there, put forth your best effort (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --have fun but don't go out to hurt someone.  You play the game as it should be played--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that's what I did, and then I got the scholarship to USF [University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California] after City College because they had came, and we had a good team.  I had never been up there to USF and all the things I was able to do for the rest of my life.  I didn't worry about tuition or anything like that.  It was a year, a year round program for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was USF like, San Francisco State [sic.], what was it like?
Speaker 2: It was small.
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at--but it's now, but at first, yeah.  And they started having football teams at college, and then they moved me to USF and they gave me a place to stay, and it just so beautiful in the sense that I had a place to stay, I had a place to eat and it was something I could have done year round because I was on a team, I was doing things in the classroom that should be done and so, hey, what's wrong with just putting forth your best effort, regardless of what you were doing.  And you will find out again that your best will be good enough.
Speaker 1: You, San Francisco State, for people who don't know, is a California state school [sic.], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And were there a lot of black students there, was it just beginning to be integrated?
Speaker 2: Not too many, not too many.  In fact, at City College, when I was going out for sports or doing that and as I said, I would do things to the best of my ability and I was able to earn a scholarship to USF, you know, and they brought me in and the rest is history.  We got along quite well and we took advantage of the opportunities we had.
Speaker 1: Okay, could you tell us something about the football team?  You were on a championship football team.
Speaker 2: We, our football team, at that time we didn't have very many black players that year, so I, of course, I'd be--they got kids from City College to come play with them, and so of course, you played the game as if to say, this game is important, so let's do the thing to the best of our ability.  And my dear friend Ollie Matson--became the best of friends, you know, and from then on it was like it was two of us and from then on things got bigger and bigger and bigger.  But most of all we took--we were able to do the things that we wanted to do and we did them well and got a scholarship and went to USF and didn't pay another cent (laughter).
Speaker 1: How wonderful.  What was your position on the team?
Speaker 2: I guess you would say, at the time where needed.
Speaker 1: Where needed.
Speaker 2: You played more than one position.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  You were a tackle, you were---in football, a player, you could play the game, you could see the game, you could catch up and take advantage of the opportunity if a guy can't run very fast, you did your best, you know, just where needed and that's what happened.  But I played football a lot; defense as well as offense.
Speaker 1: I see.  What was your favorite position?
Speaker 2: I guess you would say defense.  I would, could run from here, you know, I could--in other words, you going to the right, I could go to the right, to the left, wherever, but I could play both in football--as an end as well as a tackle.
Speaker 1: Okay, good.  So after you did football, did you--what were you thinking about--I know you, you were majoring in engineering, and but then you got so good in sports--
Story_ID: 360395
Speaker 1: You started in engineering and then you got really, really involved into sports (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah that's right.
Speaker 1: Did you change majors, were you still thinking about becoming an engineer?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, you know, had--took care of things and you know, of course, and I was taking the engineer course or something I liked here, I liked there.  In other words, I couldn't lose because I could do the job wherever I may have gone because I prepared myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, could you tell us something about your coach on your football team?  How, how was he--did he, did he make it easy for you?  Did he make it hard for you?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did he make an exception because you were black or--
Speaker 2: No, no, again too, you could play different games, I could do different positions, and wherever you have put me I put forth my best efforts, and I was able to stay wherever I was, and they--then everybody tried, all the guys, you know, it was just two of us on a team and we both would play wherever we wanted to play and--
Speaker 1: Two blacks on the team?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.  Again, like I say again, you find out what you have to do and you do it.
Speaker 1: What were some of the teams you played?
Speaker 2: Undefeated teams, good teams, good football teams.
Speaker 1: Like, like what?
Speaker 2: Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], college teams, yeah, um-hm.  So wherever they sent us before, sent in junior high school or you know, you think in terms of there, you know, being at a game to be played and we were an undefeated football team, yeah.
Story_ID: 360396
Speaker 1: You've graduated from college [University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California] and you got a teaching certificate?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us something about that?
Speaker 2: Well it was good, like any other position in a sense, you know you can do math or whatever you may because in high school, or junior high school is where I sort of planned--I studied math and I taught it.
Speaker 1: What did you teach?  Where, what school?  In San Francisco [California] or in Oakland [California], where did you teach?
Speaker 2: In San Francisco, math, um-hm, name it, I taught it.  You learn something and you can teach--and then this is where I got the kids, you know, and also to, along the way I became the principal of the school.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the school?  What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ben Franklin Junior High School [Benjamin Franklin Junior High School; Benjamin Franklin Middle School, San Francisco, California].  Ask her, she will tell you (laughter).
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  Benjamin Franklin Junior High School at Geary [Boulevard] and Turk [sic.]
Speaker 2: Geary and Turk.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  That's not Turk.  What is it, Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.], the cross street [Scott Street]?
Speaker 2: Geary and--
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  What's the cross street?  It doesn't matter right now.
Speaker 2: Oh, close by.
Speaker 1: Geary is--close by.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  And he spent his seventeen years in public school here in San Francisco at that one school.  Moving from beginning teacher to ending as principal. He went in all the chairs.
Speaker 1: Did you teach every grade?
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  A counselor, vice principal.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.
Speaker 2: No, it was a good opportunity.  You know it's something that you--first of all the kids, you know are (unclear) so as the principal I dealt with them.  I let them know that while they are here to get an education and while they're here--while I'm here you are going to do it or you won't be in the school.  And the parents began to realize that, hey, this is important, and in a sense, and they love me to this day, you know, she may have told you about what they're doing for me.  I didn't ask for it--but the kids asked for me because they felt that, you know, I've been around for a while and I took care of business and they are now young adults and I see them now and they still say things in terms of hey (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  (Simultaneous) Of what he has to say, he was just--I showed you that resolution--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  --it was from his former students--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  --that made it necessary, made it possible.  We were at a funeral yesterday for one of his USF [University of San Francisco] friends, and a young woman who's an assistant to the dean in the business department over there came up and said, "Mr. Toler, you were my principal in eighth grade."  And now she's working for the university.  And she was so proud.  She'd gone to USF, she said he had been the best motivator in her life.  She was a young--not that it makes a difference, but she was a young Filipino woman and she had come to the same funeral that we were at.
Speaker 2: I see, your--she was talking about that you were such a good principal and you made such an effect on the students that they're honoring you.  Could you tell us about the honor that they're going to give you?
Speaker 1: Well, you know I was there for a while, see (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventeen years.
Speaker 1: --seventeen years and we had such a good school because again too, I wouldn't let--accept any other than your best and they found all through the years that they did their best, and the best thing that ever happened to us because we learned what we were supposed to learn in school, and here we are now, we can go here, go there and at the time they were having fun.  But again too, we made sure that you learned something while you're here so you have something to use when you leave here.  And they found that to be so true.  And they'd say, "Man you didn't mess with Toler because (laughter) Toler would make sure, certain that you take care of business."  And they'd say if you pull up your sleeve and want to fight him, he'll fight you if he had to, but he never had to.  (Laughter) But seriously, it was something that I really enjoyed.  And when my teachers started, when they taught, of course, they were there for a purpose and they fulfilled that purpose and you look back and you see here the--right now I am, I'm so old now, I just (laughter)--
Speaker 2: No, you're a young thing.
Speaker 1: But no, but they talk about me now and how, but really to put the ice on things that usually a lot of teachers don't want to transfer and go to another school because of the behavior they preserved and they did--they, the behavior they had, you know, you had to always do that, but my--I was there, they made certain, I made certain that if you don't like something here teachers, you can move on, but you're going to teach while you're here.  And the kids have received this type of feeling and also they can do things now.  And so this is something they say, advice I said to the teachers, if you don't like the teachers, it's just maybe we'll perhaps say, give you another assignment somewhere.  But if you're there, you've got a job to do and you do it.
Story_ID: 360397
Speaker 1: Was your staff, was it predominately black or was it white?
Speaker 2: No, it was white, all white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was all white?
Speaker 2: Not all white, but almost white.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  You had that man who was an industrial arts teacher that we see once in a while, Mr. Eberhart [ph.]
Speaker 2: Eberhart, Eberhart, yeah.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  And then you had the guy who's married to the woman who lives out there near you.  He's still teaching.  He was not an especially good teacher and his wife was, course that's--they met at your school.
Speaker 2: And what they don't like, like I said again, they knew that I had control, and I told the teachers, you may have two or three blacks on the team, but you may have twenty-five teachers here, and then I said, if you don't like it here, to the teachers, you're here for a purpose, teach, now if you don't like it here, let me know and I will get someone to take your place.  But to make a long story short (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  (Simultaneous) Tell her what you told them.
Speaker 2: Go head babe, tell them, you let--
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  In your words.
Speaker 2: Go ahead baby.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  Give a damn about the kids.
Speaker 2: I told them, you know, if you don't like it here then let me know and also, I said it like this, I said, "If you don't like it I'll find you someplace to go, but give a damn about these kids, the kids are here for a purpose and we expect this from you, to take advantage and teach your kids.  If you don't like something let me know and I can--if you want a transfer I'll help you out (unclear)."
Speaker 1: How long were you principal?
Speaker 2: I never counted the years, but it was--
Speaker 1: A lot?
Speaker 2: --four or five years, five years, then I transferred.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  As we stated before, you were so, you made such an effect on the students that something is--the city council [San Francisco Board of Supervisors] has made a resolution to honor you.
Speaker 2: Well see, if the teachers are teaching and the kids start learning, and they help prove that and they are so happy to be able to say, I did this, or I got them to read from there, but now, they're saying that's what happened, you know.  We were, they were our business.  I told the teachers and they went out and threatened fathers and I let them know that if you don't like it here, let me know and I'll get you out of here--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but while you're here, you're going to do the job that you are supposed to be doing, and they started doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the kids would say they have been able to take advantage of the things they learned there to go further.
Speaker 1: Okay, some of your students, your former students went to the city council and they had a resolution.  The name of the school is not going to be Benjamin Franklin [Benjamin Franklin Junior High School; Benjamin Franklin Middle School, San Francisco, California] anymore is it?  What's it going to be?
Speaker 2: Oh no, they're going to change it (laughter).
Speaker 1: What are they going to change it to?  What are they going to change it to?
Speaker 2: There, in that school.
Speaker 1: --to what?  What are they going to change the name of the school to?
Speaker 2: Baby, what's the school being named?
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  What's your name babe?
Speaker 2: Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.], Burl (laughter).
Speaker 1: They are going to rename the school to what?
Speaker 2: Burl (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  (Simultaneous) Burl.
Speaker 2: --A. Toler.
Speaker 1: To just Burl?
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Burl A. Toler Middle School [Burl A. Toler Campus, San Francisco, California].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, isn't that wonderful!
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  It's already been passed by the board [San Francisco Unified School District Board of Education].
Speaker 2: Right, isn't that exciting.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  And the school is planning their celebration of the name change.
Speaker 2: Don't you feel honored that they thought so much of you?
Speaker 1: You know it's so good, you enjoy, because you know the students that are people now, they're adults now, and they feel so good about where they are, and they just said, "Let's do this," and they have done it.
Speaker 2: You're very lucky.
Speaker 1: But it was so easy in a sense because I realized what I'd received from teachers, and I expected them to do the same thing, and because you feel good about after it's all over because you're where you want to be.  And for efforts, for your efforts, you know, you're able to do this and then you feel good about what you have done.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You have put forth your best effort and you find that that has been the best thing for you.
Speaker 2: Okay, so how did you feel when you heard this?
Speaker 1: I felt good, I feel great--grateful to everybody, really.  I always had fun and had been able to do things as they should be done.  And I met, and was able to do it with the teachers that I had and the students I had, you know.  They feel good about what they have done or received.

Speaker 1: So after you finished your years at Benjamin Franklin [Benjamin Franklin Junior High School; Benjamin Franklin Middle School, San Francisco, California] what did you do?  Did you go back to graduate school?
Speaker 2: I went to school, I went to school, back to school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --and of course, got my credentials on ed [education] and--
Speaker 1: You got a master's [degree]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was your master's in?
Speaker 2: I guess you would say education.
Speaker 1: In education.  And it was at what school, US- the University of San Francisco [San Francisco, California]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: In like 19--1966 or?
Speaker 2: I don't know the exact time but again it was right after--in the '60s [1960s], it was in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's been a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Franklin the only school you were working at, or did you work at other schools?
Speaker 2: Oh, I worked at other schools, but when I--I was just part time with the others, but again, I didn't lose a day.  The teachers didn't leave me.  They stayed with me the whole time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I knew I had the students under control and they said, "Well, why not."  I said, "You don't like it here, let me know," to the teachers.  If you can't do the job, they said, sure; teaching here, if you don't like it let me know and I have people to talk to the teachers, I can always find a position someplace else.
Story_ID: 360399
Speaker 1: Okay, the same time that you're teaching, you have a whole different kind of a career going on the side that had to--an extension of your sports in college.  Could you tell us a little bit about the National Football League [NFL]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yes, you know, I started officiating, and of course working, and I worked of course, and I did my job there.
Speaker 1: Was this at like high school games and you did little (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did all of that yeah, before.  And the kids, they would see me in New York [New York] on a Sunday.  I would beat them back on Monday, and they can't believe, "What did you do, how do you get back?"  Well, again, I had to take time and explain it to them what we did, and I--so the teachers stayed there of course, and all the students stayed because they knew that down there people--as I said, you do, look, say you're here for a purpose, if you don't like what you're doing, teach, let me know, I'll find a place for you away from here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what I did.
Speaker 1: How did you get involved in the National Football League?
Speaker 2: Well, it's like this, you start officiating college, college, and the next step will be the NFL.  But too--again too, you had to qualify that you could do the thing and did it well.  And I started working and before you knew it Pete Rozelle, you know, all these people, my buddies around the way, they started getting behind me and of course I was the first black official in the National Football League.
Speaker 1: And what was your, what, when you say the first black official, what was, exactly what was your position?
Speaker 2: I was an official, you call the strikes and you make sure that you can do the job (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  (Simultaneous) You were a line judge, babe.
Speaker 2: Oh, line judge, oh yeah, line judge.
Speaker 1: Line judge.
Speaker 2: But I was an official, and I was just assigned to be a line, be a head linesman, and that's where I spent my time most of the time.
Speaker 1: For those of us who don't know football very well, what does a--so what exactly did you do?  A linesman does, what is, so what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well a head linesman, offside, you--
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 2: You call a lot of offside--so you move and those kinds of things, that's your job.  If the ball comes to you with the player, you take that around up the field yourself, if they go and step out of bounds I stop play, my point is that you have an area that you cover, and the things that you do is up to you.
Speaker 1: Okay, how exactly did you--did you have to take a test to be a National Football League linesman?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes and then the--well they have a test, you have to play the game, and you've got to be able to do your job as the head linesman, so that if someone jumps offside you throw the flag, you know, and then they play again; but those kinds of things, and you're being watched by the whole world.  And so you think in terms of getting the job done.  But in all that so it was so beautiful in that sense.  That you had people there who knew the work and I did my job and they would look at you, and sent you out to do the job as it should be done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I enjoyed it.  It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Burl's [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] team, the team he played on in 1951--
Speaker 1: The college team?
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  --the eleven players that were starters all went into the pros when they graduated [from University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California].  He was injured the summer after graduation.  In a game called the all-star game [Chicago Charities College All-Star Game], when at that time the best pro team in the country played the best college team--guys, not the whole team.  He and Ollie [Ollie Matson] and, I can never remember his name, but three or four of them were invited to go back for that.
Speaker 1: It was the Super Bowl [sic.].
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Yeah, it was, it was pre-Super Bowl.
Speaker 1: We had to--
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  They had the Super Bowl last week, you know where, and after that--
Speaker 1: So he was injured.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  --he was injured, he had to have surgery, so he never did get to play although the Cleveland Browns had signed him to play pro ball, so he stayed out.  He had married in January and then by the time this came along his wife [Melvia Woolfolk Toler] had gotten pregnant, they had their first child in November and she didn't want him away (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I had six.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  --so he never, ever went to play, he became instead, an official.  Now my take on that is, at some point when he was officiating high school and college, and building up and making extra money and building up a reputation, Pete Rozelle became the first athletic commissioner for NFL.
Story_ID: 360400
Speaker 1: We're going to back up a teeny, teeny bit.  You, you're in college and you're on, you are playing football on this championship team, and when you all graduated from college, what happened to the rest of the team?
Speaker 2: Well, they stayed and played ball, some who did not finish, they went ahead and finished, you know.  As far as that, they didn't get the game that they should have received because of these two black (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Myself and Ollie Matson, that's who, that's who got All-American, got two.
Speaker 1: Okay, your champ- the, your 1951 team, the players, some of them became, most of them became pros, is that right?
Speaker 2: Let's say this here, when we didn't get the bid for (unclear), they just disregarded as far as the football, they dropped it because they didn't let us play, the black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, they did?
Speaker 2: They did not.
Speaker 1: They did not.
Speaker 2: They let all the other players, but the university had to turn it down because here again, had an opportunity to send everybody to it, to the Super Bowl [sic.], but they chose not to because the two blacks--it's been a long time ago.
Speaker 1: This is when you were playing with San Francisco [University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California], they wouldn't let you guys play, so (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They wouldn't let us play as a team.
Speaker 1: They wouldn't--so they, the whole team said we're not going to go?
Speaker 2: That's right.  There were two of us, but, but they--I don't know whether you have the book ['Undefeated, Untied, and Uninvited: A Documentary of the 1951 University of San Francisco Dons Football Team,' Kristine Setting Clark] here, it says it.
Speaker 1: Right, I see it over there.
Speaker 2: They didn't play the USF [University of San Francisco] team because of the two black players.
Speaker 1: What school was this that wouldn't play you?
Speaker 2: I don't know which one it was back then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I--there were different teams that could play, and those who were sort of above, they were the ones who would get, the team would get the job if they were number one.  And like I say, we were number one in a sense, and they wouldn't play us because the two black guys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Myself and Ollie.
Speaker 1: You know, and what was Ollie's last name?
Speaker 2: Ollie Matson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  After you guys--that's interesting.  After you guys are seniors, and you graduate, and the other people on the team, your other teammates, they all went on to be pro players, is that true?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Maybe they may have played pro, but as far as getting that team to play after the end of the season, they would not play them because again, we were, had the honors and we should have gone, but because of the two black guys.
Speaker 1: So this is like the national championship, they wouldn't let you, they, okay.  This is in nineteen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the book tells you the story of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: It's a nice little book.
Speaker 1: Yes, it is a nice little book.  You've, you finish school, college, you're out of college, did you--why didn't you play football after you graduated from college?
Speaker 2: Well actually it was--we did play football.  However, we did not go to, to the game, the bowl game (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay the bowl game.
Speaker 2: --because of those who were black.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay, so you missed the--which bowl?
Speaker 2: You saw that in the book?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it was shown, shown in there pretty--you know, because here we had these two black guys, you can't play us.
Speaker 1: Do you remember which bowl it was?  The Rose Bowl [sic. Orange Bowl], maybe?
Speaker 2: It's all shown in there, I think it was the Super Bowl [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I'll find it in a minute.
Story_ID: 360401
Speaker 1: When you were at school [University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California], there was your director of athletics, his name was Pete Rozelle.
Speaker 2: Pete Rozelle was the umbrella.  Pete was--he was in charge of all the games, all teams are under here, you know, and so because they didn't get us, they had to just cancel it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (unclear), if you can't deal with them, you will not deal with anybody unless you--
Speaker 1: So Pete Rozelle was on your side, even when you were (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he was the big man in charge of all the games.  I won't tell you the story there, you can just look at it ['Undefeated, Untied, and Uninvited: A Documentary of the 1951 University of San Francisco Dons Football Team,' Kristine Setting Clark], it's on the table.  It's not much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But again, it's just like anything else, you know, we were, say, singled out to be the first team, but because of the black people on the team, just two of us, they wouldn't, and so USF [University of San Francisco] for many years dropped football.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  When you graduated from college, you were married [to Melvia Woolfolk Toler], is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: How did you--and you, you were a teacher, so you started teaching.  What happened to the other teammates?  Did (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no care, they were working at other places because let's say they are, let's say they were all seniors or they all--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so they found jobs.  They went to school for a purpose.
Speaker 1: Did they play football after that, after they left college, your teammates?
Speaker 2: Well, like I say we didn't have no, we didn't know, we did not.  I would, I would say a couple of them, some of--
Speaker 1: Some of them went to the pros?
Speaker 2: They could have, yeah, they went to the pros, but the game itself, that's what's bothering me, we were entitled to play that game, you know.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But they wouldn't give us the game, so we just stopped it--dropped the football there, but the other team just went ahead because it had to be done.
Speaker 1: They went and played.
Speaker 2: They were next in line so they took advantage of it.
Speaker 1: I see, I see.  So you feel bad that your team didn't get to go to the championship (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, well the team, you know, say we were, Kuharich [Joe Kuharich], Ollie [Ollie Matson] and Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] decided football here, and they did, at the school.
Speaker 1: So they ended the football program at the school?
Speaker 2: No, that summer.
Speaker 1: That year?
Speaker 2: They dropped football.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're, you're married--
Speaker 2: Six kids, three girls, I had three girls, three boys.
Speaker 1: That's right, you had--
Speaker 2: Or three boys and three girls, a lot of college.  And they all went on and they are working.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good.  You also, you got hurt in football, right?  And so you couldn't go to the pros, you said?
Speaker 2: I didn't want to go to the pros.
Speaker 1: You didn't want to go?
Speaker 2: No, because you know, I couldn't--my knee.
Speaker 1: Your knee was hurt.  It got hurt in the game when you were playing in college?
Speaker 2: In the game [Chicago Charities College All-Star Game].
Speaker 1: So you couldn't go to the pros?
Speaker 2: I didn't want to go.
Speaker 1: You didn't--but the Cleveland Browns wanted you to come play with them.
Speaker 2: That was the beginning of it, no, they wanted me to come, yeah.  But again, read that, just, I don't know how many pages are on that--they said if you can't--if the team, look at the team as a team that's what it says, say there to do the job, we were eligible, but if you can't play Ollie and Burl against this team, we don't want to play anybody at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you've hurt your knees and, and the Cleveland Browns have drafted you, they wanted you to come play, but you can't because you're injured and, and what did you, how did, what did Pete Rozelle do?
Speaker 2: He said, "If you can't play us, this team will drop football," that's what we did.  It was a team, it was a school team that said, if they can't play Ollie--they were eligible--if you can't play them, we don't want to play anybody--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with the whole team.
Story_ID: 360402
Speaker 1: You're married.  Your wife [Melvia Woolfolk Toler] is--you have your first child, okay, and you're teaching, and are you also, to earn extra money, are you officiating at like high school games, and being a referee?
Speaker 2: I was working, I was, worked games, football games.  I was an official striped shirt.
Speaker 1: Right, right, at like high school games?
Speaker 2: No, college, it was all college, it was all college.
Speaker 1: You officiated at colleges, okay.  And you must have been, had a good reputation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  I did.
Speaker 1: You were fair.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I could do the job.
Speaker 1: You did your, did a good job.
Speaker 2: It was the school that said we drop football.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But other teams can go do what they want to do.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: But we thought that if we can't take us, the two of us, we won't take anybody at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you've, you're officiating different high school and college games around the area and Pete Rozelle, who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was--we were eligible for the game--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Pete Rozelle being in charge--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --he said--and the school itself said that if Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] and them can't go, we don't want to go at all.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The other team can go, but the team that was there to go, but again too, wouldn't accept that type of behavior.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Pete Rozelle had left--
Speaker 2: He was in charge of all the games.
Speaker 1: He was in charge of the college games--
Speaker 2: And not college, but the pros.
Speaker 1: --the pros, so he goes on to the pros and--
Speaker 2: See Pete Rozelle is here, so he was in charge of all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --so you choose a game or team, somebody up here would be the person chosen, but they would be eligible too.  The USF [University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California] team was eligible.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But they would not play because--
Speaker 1: You had black players.
Speaker 2: --you can't have the whole team.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So after Mr. Rozelle leaves San Francisco [California] he goes to the NFL [National Football League].
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: --he was there; he was there in charge--
Speaker 1: Yes, I know, he was there.
Speaker 2: He was in charge of all the NFL teams.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: So they went ahead--but not, not this team that was eligible--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --didn't, we didn't want to go.
Speaker 1: You didn't want to go because the team didn't want to go.  Okay, how did, so, you were working, you've graduated from college, you have a wife, you start teaching school [at Benjamin Franklin Junior High School; Benjamin Franklin Middle School, San Francisco, California] and you are officiating games on the weekends, like high school and things, right?
Speaker 2: Before then--yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you get involved with the NFL?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, you know, you have to go through the--it's like you're just starting, you work these college games, and of course, this is one that's over here, so you work those games, so you go and start working, you know, as an official, you know, you can work the Super Bowls and all those things, yeah.
Speaker 1: So how did (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They wanted a person because every school did not have officials working, you know, this is something that the national, this is what--Rozelle is in charge, so the person chosen, and like I say again, the kids, you know, are entitled to a game, we should have played as a team, but because they didn't want the team to maintain the two black guys, the team, the school, dropped them, the school dropped them.  They didn't mess with the other guys, but the school said, "If they can't play, Ollie [Ollie Matson] and Burl, we won't play at all," and they were eligible.
Speaker 1: Okay, I understand that, so, you've graduated from college and you're married and you're officiating games and Pete Rozelle is at the, he's in charge of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, now this is when we were playing.
Speaker 1: No, no, yes, I understand that.  After you, after you, you're done with college, okay, we, so we're going to go on.  After you, you've gotten out of school and Mr. Rozelle has left San Francisco State [sic.] and he's gone on to the pros, and he's in charge of all the pros, some of your other players have become pro players, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But you got injured [at the Chicago Charities College All-Star Game], so you couldn't go on to the pros even though the Cleveland Browns wanted you to come play.  So your leg is hurt, and you're doing, you're officiating at other games and Pete Rozelle asked you to come and be a linesman, right?
Speaker 2: To be a player.
Speaker 1: Right, to be an official.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 360403
Speaker 1: How long were you an official with the National Football League [NFL]?
Speaker 2: For twenty something years.
Speaker 1: Twenty-seven [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I officiated about twenty something years, I was an official, um-hm.
Speaker 1: That was a long time.  So you must have seen some very interesting players.
Speaker 2: I don't know the number, but it was quite normal because I worked every week someplace.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  In the season.
Speaker 2: In the season, during the season, and I think it's very interesting that baseball umpires, they have a league, and they're professional and that's all they do; and basketball referees, they are professional, that's all they do, but in football you're not really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tied down.
Speaker 2: You're kind of like part time because you just--
Speaker 1: On Sundays I'd do that and then--
Speaker 2: Yeah, on Sundays--
Speaker 1: --I'd go to work on Monday morning.
Speaker 2: Yes, on Sundays, and then you'd go back to school Monday morning and you'd be teaching.  So this was kind of like a part time job?
Speaker 1: It was a part time job.
Speaker 2: It was a part time job.
Speaker 1: And it's something that the kids--I'd go to work on say--I was a principal, I would go to work on Monday, but on Sunday they saw me working a game in New York [New York], and I'd beat them back to school on Monday, you know, they, there was, you know, that was legitimate and everything else, you know, but again, otherwise, if I had to get a person that who--to take care of my spot, but again it just so happened I worked on Sunday, I'd fly back, take me five or six hours, back home here and I'd beat them to school on Monday morning.  They'd say, "What happened, what, we saw you in New York."  "I didn't say you didn't," but they realized too that I would came back home by plane in seven or eight hours.  I beat them back home, and they said, "What are you doing here now?  We saw you in New York."  I'd say, "Yes, you did."  But I had worked, say, the game on Sunday and the kids would just, they couldn't believe that I could beat them back home, but it was the little things like that, but I enjoyed my work and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You had--you said you had twenty years officiating.  What were some of the players who stand out in your mind, some of the football players that you--
Speaker 1: No actually, I didn't watch the players, you know, as far as I'd been, we had to go to watch the players, you'd be--just watch what they may do--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and then we'd make our decision as to what we should do as in our group, all the officials, or maybe all of them didn't see what I may have seen, but they knew that they had to look at what we did.  And so far, you know, we had a good game; say just like the Super Bowl ring, you know, they, you worked the Super Bowl, it was a stop game.
Speaker 2: Right, you got to officiate the first Super Bowl [Super Bowl I].
Speaker 1: Not the first Super Bowl, not the first, no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not the first one, oh?
Speaker 1: --for me.
Speaker 2: For you, okay, but there were, there were--you were in three Super, three Super Bowls, that you officiated.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  He was part of the team.
Speaker 1: I was part of the team.
Speaker 2: Part of the officiating team.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, and you got a ring?  You got a ring?
Speaker 1: Yes, I did.
Speaker 2: For each one?
Speaker 1: Well, just say this, that the Super Bowl is a game, and you spend say three of them in some way, you have been involved in some way with what happened, whether it was just working part time, or just working to take care of that game, you may sit on the bench, but you are on that team and you considered as being in the Super Bowl game as an official.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  His ring was for the fourteenth [Super Bowl XIV].
Speaker 2: Your ring is for the fourteenth?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I wish we had it to show it to you, but again it's so--
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  It's at your house, because that one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know, I know baby.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you officiated the fourteenth Super Bowl and some other championships and different playoff games?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, I did a lot of those before, playoff games, but the big game is, you don't do a lot of them because you have, trained by certain guys who, you know, working as a team, and they were entitled to something when the refs decide with the three of them in their capacity.
Speaker 2: In order to have gotten that far you must have been very, very respected in your field.
Speaker 1: I did my job and I did it well.
Speaker 2: You did it well.
Speaker 1: They chose, I didn't choose it, they chose it and that's the reason why you feel so good about what you have done, but in the meantime, you know, you keep moving.
Story_ID: 360404
Speaker 1: We mentioned that you were the first linesman (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) First official, first official.
Speaker 1: --first official, I'm sorry, first official.  Now it's 2006--
Speaker 2: I've been retired now probably--
Speaker 1: --right--
Speaker 2: How many years baby?
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  You retired in 1991 [sic.].
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991], so about fifteen years has gone on.  Are there--how many--are there like about 118 officials now?  How many are, would be black, now?  Did you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't know the number now because it has grown from when we left.
Speaker 2: It's not a lot, it's not a high number, maybe about--
Speaker 1: We have six, seven official black officials in the league.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  The last time we counted there were seventeen or eighteen.
Speaker 1: So the last time you counted there were seventeen or eighteen African American officials in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's something about it because there are seven officials in a given game.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: And that's say, there may be only one black there, but sometimes you may find two blacks on the same team.  But when I was there--
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  And sometimes you don't find any.
Speaker 2: And sometimes there's none.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Sometimes there are not enough to go around.
Speaker 1: In, you have, you have this long career, lots of experience being a linesman, how was it, how was it--and you watched it on--I'm sure you watched the games on the TV?
Speaker 2: I don't watch on the TV, I've seen so much of it up close.  But I don't watch them all.  She may watch (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you don't watch them anymore?
Speaker 2: --she may not watch them.  She may want to watch them.  I'll watch them with her.
Speaker 1: Has it changed any since when you started officiating?  There are more officials (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well there are more officials on a given game.  There used to be just five, now they have seven to officiate, you know, and they had to, you know somewhat, they have increased, increased some.
Speaker 1: When you started they didn't have instant replay?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So they had to take your word for it?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) but it's so okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  (Simultaneous) However, when he got his award from the officials, when we went to Canton [Ohio] that year, and it's in one of those scrapbooks, I talked to the people that we had dinner with before the presentation and the man who had been supervisor when Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] went to work for the NFL [National Football League] was at our table, and I asked him what he was going to say when he got up to present Burl's award, and he did the wrong thing, he asked me what should he say, so I told him, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  --and he said what I said, which was, they left Burl out there as the only official of color for five years to see how well he could handle himself, and he became the tester.  After that they hired several others, but the next was a guy that Burl recommended from Portland [Oregon] who may still be working, we don't know.  Is Nate [ph.] still working baby?
Speaker 2: I think so baby.  He's doing something.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  But anyway he recommended the next one and his name is Nate, I can't think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thurmond [Nate Thurmond].
Speaker 1: Nate Thurmond, oh, Nate Thurmond--
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  No, no--
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  --that's a basketball player baby.  Nate up in Portland had a different name.
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Yes you do.
Speaker 1: I know who you're speaking of baby.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  I'll think of it in a little while.
Speaker 1: Nathan, Nathan, wait.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  We've been up to visit.
Speaker 1: His last name, his first name is Nate, that's what--
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  I'll think of it in a while.  Anyway, what I was going to say is, after Burl stopped working the field, he retired in '91 [1991] when his wife [Melvia Woolfolk Toler] was ill.  He took a year off and then the following year he began to be an observer for them.  He rated the guys working on the field, the neophytes.  NFL would notify him where he was to go.  He wouldn't go out of the state, but he went to Oakland [California], San Diego [California], Los Angeles [California] and if there was a new official on the field, his job was to evaluate them and send their reports back, and he enjoyed doing it, but he didn't like doing the reports.  So how many years did you do it baby until he got tired one night and would not do it anymore.
Speaker 1: I got tired.  I enjoyed the years, so you would go and see the game, and I'd have to watch the officials working, so you know, you did--I did it as long as I wanted to, let's put it like that.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  The kids were all out of college.
Speaker 1: Everybody was out of school then, and so I said, why not.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  It wasn't a financial necessity.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 360405
Speaker 1: She just reminded us that you, when you started being an official [for the National Football League (NFL)], you were an official for five--you were the only black official for five years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And Mr. Rozelle [Pete Rozelle] wanted to see how you would, how the fans and the teams would react to having a black official, and it must have worked pretty good.
Speaker 2: I didn't think as far as--well, they didn't start the singling out black officials and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  (Simultaneous) They didn't start what baby?
Speaker 2: As far as singling out someone who could work in that capacity.
Speaker 1: How were you received?
Speaker 2: Again too, you have to, your experience as an official with college and you move up the ladder sort of speak.
Speaker 1: How did the fans receive you, did, were the any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, so far.
Speaker 1: -- the first time that you went out there, what did they, did they--
Speaker 2: Well one thing did--they may have looked, everybody.
Speaker 1: They--nobody booed, or nobody--
Speaker 2: No, they may have booed, but they weren't booing at me (laughter).
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  See the difference was if--I shouldn't get into this, but, if there was a bad call, they could tell right away it wasn't Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.], he was the only black on the field and the guy who made the call was black--was not black, then they couldn't bother him.  The problem was, how could they protect the other guy, so he became the one that they'd send out last so they got the ones who were in trouble off the field before anything happened--
Story_ID: 360406
Speaker 1: You were the first official, and you worked for five years and then other black officials came onboard, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you retired from the NFL [National Football League] in 1991 [sic.], right?
Speaker 2: I had surgery.  I think that's the time, what year it was.  I can find out for you for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you took a year off.  Your kids are all grown now.  Your wife [Melvia Woolfolk Toler] was ill, and then the NFL asked you to come back to help to evaluate the new officials.
Speaker 2: The new officials, that's right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so you traveled around a lot and you would go to games and if--you'd write them up and say, you know, he's a good guy, or he's not a good guy, is that what you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you--could you tell us something about those years when you were evaluating other referees?  How did, did--
Speaker 2: I didn't have any problem, you know, because you know what they may have done or what happened during the course of the game, you just report that, and then again I might say it's your fault, or you did this when you shouldn't have done it, no.  But again too we know that, we had accepted, more or less responsible for being able to deal, to let them know how things were done.  So there were a couple of things that we didn't like but two, then again, a couple against a hundred is not too much.  But still they wanted it to be perfect.  Now I'm sure many of them didn't feel that way, but again too, you saw, you used your head, had the judgment.
Speaker 1: Did--I assume that you enjoyed your years as an official (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I had fun, yes, yes that's true, I had to spend a lot of money for school and all, but I had some money to spend and things were good, you know, the girls and boys, now they are women and men, I'm so glad.  They're eating and buying their own food, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: These are your children, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 360407
Speaker 1: Shall we talk about your wife and your children?
Speaker 2: We had six kids.
Speaker 1: What was your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Melvia [Melvia Woolfolk Toler].
Speaker 1: Melvia, and her maiden name was?
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  It's on there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm sorry.  Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Woolfolk.
Speaker 1: Woolfolk, okay.
Speaker 2: Woolfolk, Woolfolk.  I was just thinking back about what (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  (Simultaneous) I found it on the--
Speaker 2: Melvia Woolfolk.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  On the thing you have.
Speaker 2: Yes, I have it, okay, all right.  So you have six, you have six children.  Could you tell us about your six children?
Speaker 1: Well, you know it's like this, you know, the six children were there, some because their mother wanted, and the father wanted, and we thought that they're here now, we've got to make sure that they go to school and they take advantage of it, and within time you know, they will have something to deal with, which they were.  And then, you know, they were ready to go anyplace.  They did their own choosing, you know, they had something, they have jobs that they like, or they wanted to fulfill, but you know, that's how, this is what happened.  And they all are not married, well, not married, we have a couple that's not married out of the six, but they are there and they have their own place, a home, place of course, too.  That's something that we made certain that they had.
Speaker 2: Okay, so their names are--you have, Valerie [Valerie Toler Creary] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Valerie.
Speaker 2: --she became a nurse, is that right?
Speaker 1: Probably, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And yours, your first son [Burl Toler, Jr.]?

Speaker 1: Yeah, yes, yeah, I mean this was at Cal Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].

Speaker 1: (Laughter) She's saying like they're blind, or like, "Is that you, Mr. Toler?"
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Last time we walked through--we walked through this little park, there is a plaque on the ground in that newest little mall, and it has his name, and so these guys were sitting on a bench and we came past, and one of them popped up and said, "Mr. Toler, that is you," and Burl said, "Yes," and he said, "We were just talking about you.  We just saw your name on the ground."

Story_ID: 360412
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life?  You had a good life?
Speaker 2: I don't have any problem because personally, you know, I'm where I want to be and if I do something that should be done, I can help to get it done, I do.  And I just feel good because, like I say again, my friends, I have many of them, thank God for them.  I don't advise--if I hear footsteps, I don't really look behind me, if they are coming after me because I've tried to be myself all these years, and at my age now, I just say good things and I've been blessed or we've been blessed, you know, if you just say, if I could do it again, I'd do it the same way.
Speaker 1: Would you?  You have no regrets.  There's nothing you would've liked to have done differently or, oh, I should have done that, no?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, good.
Speaker 2: Just like I say, do your best wherever you're at.  Think in terms of you as well as other people because you can't do it all by yourself, and you have that help that people who think the way you do, but if you don't get it together you know, I'm saying, when you look back through the years, you know, I really, you know, as we all time say, give thanks each day because we're indeed blessed and I'll forever be grateful.
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life what stands out the most?  What's--
Speaker 2: I'm still the guy I was fifty years ago as far (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's wonderful.
Speaker 2: --as self; as far as looking at others and helping out those that, who we can, you know, it's like I say, I don't have to look behind me--if footsteps I hear, I don't have to say--they're not after me because I have done things that I wanted to do, and tried to be of help and sure someone that I may have helped will not be--he may be at the guy who's coming to get me; they're coming my way; "Man, don't you mess with Toler [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.]."
Speaker 1: That's right.  What values do you consider to be important and why?
Speaker 2: You look at the kids and hope and trust that they can do things that we have done or be able to be the people that we have been as far as helping themselves to do better, or helping others who, with problems they may have, or being we say true, to let them know that we are still here and we'll do anything to help them, but provided that you do the things that you should, or could do and if, far as father and mothers and something like that.  You know, I say, "Why, why are you doing this?"  You don't have to do this.  You're a big girl or a big boy now, be the lady that you can be also and be the man that you can be also, but know that you ought to try to make things better if you can.  And they see me now--some of them fifty years old, some are sixty (laughter).
Speaker 1: They're just babies (laughter).
Speaker 2: But no, it's just something that you have to be safe, it's like they say, you try and be yourself (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: --and you try and do your very best to help others to become because if I can do it, they can do it.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be--you have many, many, many, many, many more years to go, but how would you like--what would you like for people to think about you, to remember about you?
Speaker 2: I'm for real.
Speaker 1: That you're for real?
Speaker 2: For real, yeah.  I don't, I don't do things for the sake of getting--you're doing this or doing that.  I try to be myself day in and day out whether I have a suit on or a pair of Levi's, you know, it's something that I will never get.  My parents [Annie King Toler and Arnold Toler, Sr.], you know, they think in terms of here, put forth the best effort and be the person that you should be, and don't say, take care of someone that you don't know anything about; you can't help, you can help, you know, if you get close enough, you let them know, or you know, "Hey, why are you doing that?  You're a big boy now."  And like some of the kids I know, you know, "Hey, we can do better."
Speaker 1: That's true.  I know you have six children and you have numerous grandchildren.
Speaker 2: Seven, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Seven grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have any messages or something you'd like to tell them?
Speaker 2: I guess I can, "Take care of yourself," of course.  And if you can help someone to become a better person, do it, because we all can do something.  And the little we can do, or can't do, you can deal with that too, but now that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's all right, that's all right.
Speaker 2: --be proud of who you are--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, and don't try to be any more, but just help and that you can do.  And I know myself, that I, kids make me crumble sometimes.  I see some guys that have gone the wrong way, I try to say, "Hey, come on," to them.  You can do better.  You are never too old to do things to be a help to others if you can in this life, and be proud of who we are.  There's only one you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: --take care of them.
Speaker 1: Well, I think this has been a wonderful interview.
Speaker 2: It sure has.  And also too, if you, when you get ready to put things up, if you have anything you'd like to have us look at or talk, please let us know, you know, and now no one's perfect, but at least if we try to do our very best at all times and often that's support.  Your just being here taking care of this is something that I had never thought it'd be like this, and she there.  It's just that we're happy and we say daily, give thanks.  We're here to stay and we feel good about where we are and what we have done.
Speaker 1: Well, good, that's wonderful.  I want to thank you for being so gracious with your time and for getting up so early in the morning and coming over here.  We really enjoyed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We, we--
Speaker 1: --meeting you.
Speaker 2: --one hand washes the other.  We feel, believe that.
Speaker 1: Well thank you.  It was wonderful meeting you.  Thank you sir, very much.
Speaker 2: And this young lady here as I've said a number of times, you know, thank God.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you so much.

Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  The Hall of Fame [Pro Football Hall of Fame, Canton, Ohio] when Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] received an award from them back in the late '90s [1990s].  I have the exact date some place.  That's the picture that hangs in the Hall of Fame.
Speaker 2: Yes it does.
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  There are busts of the actual players, but there was no bust of him, but there was that huge picture.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  His university, the University of San Francisco [San Francisco, California] made him alumnus of the year and awarded him.  That was at graduation up at the University of San Francisco beside St. Ignatius Church [San Francisco, California], where the ceremonies were held.  His daughter Jennifer [Jennifer Toler-Fruit], his youngest, is in the photograph with us.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  That was at our trip to Canton.  All of the men in that photograph were former officials.  The man on the far left, Art [ph.], was the supervisor when Burl was chosen.  They would, the newest members, the ones who were standing in the back of--the newer members of the Referees Association [NFL Referees Association].  Those seated were the ones who had the most service and were being awarded and they received special footballs.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  There's a group of men, used to be--I can't remember the man's name who organized it, but he wrote for one of the newspapers and he had what he called an annual sports luncheon.  Burl was featured that day.  He's wearing a shirt that doesn't have the right number on it, but it has his name and they bring high school kids in for motivational purposes.  So he's doing his thing.
Speaker 2: Things, together we do it.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  That picture predates, well, it's before he graduated from the University of San Francisco in 1952, so it was either 1950 or '51 [1951].  He's seated at the table, at the far left is former mayor John Shelley [John F. Shelley], the next person is Father Carlin [Harry Carlin], Mr. Toler is in the center and we don't know the name of the priest who's speaking, but it was a special luncheon at USF [University of San Francisco] when he was a student there in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  New York Times [The New York Times] had that photograph on their January, February magazine for television.  And it shows Burl with his crew discussing something on the play.  The names are on--they were playing--it was the Super Bowl game and it says it's twenty-six, if I can read it, in Minneapolis [Minnesota].
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  That was his class reunion at Manassas High School in Memphis, Tennessee about five years ago.  He is on the third row first person on the left.  There were--they were the class of 1948, graduating from Manassas High School.  And this would have been their fiftieth anniversary.
Speaker 1: Back to his roots.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  That's back to his roots, North Carolina, which is my home.  It was a large field which my cousin owns and it had cotton and he was going to demonstrate to me how good he could pick cotton, how well he can pick cotton.  And he brags about how he had his first competitive experience with his first cousins picking cotton in Mississippi one summer, late summer.
Speaker 1: Great, next.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  That's the night that the University of San Francisco made him the man of the year, the alumnus of the year.  That's the proud father with his sons and daughters and daughter-in law.  Starting--you want the names of all of them in the order?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Left to right starting on the top shelf, Darrell Carr who was the fiance at the time of the woman on the left, on the, next to her father, Susan Toler, now she's Susan Toler Carr.  Next to Darrell on the back row is Gregory Toler, son number two, starting on the second row, Valerie Toler [Valerie Toler Creary], first child, oldest, center, Jennifer, youngest child, the last one on the end, Martel [Martel Toler], the youngest son.  On the first, on the bottom standing next to her father, Susan Toler Carr and on the far right, Susan Toler and Burl Toler III.  I was trying to think of Susan's maiden name, but they have, they are the father and mother of Burl's grandchildren.  He is Burl Toler the Second [Burl Toler, Jr.] who also played football at the University of California, Berkeley [Berkeley, California], and who has a son who just graduated from there, who also played football, Burl III.  It was a great thrill to grandpa last year when we went to homecoming and Burl Jr. was on the field and we were up on the stands and Burl Jr. was--Burl III was on the field.  Burl the II was down on the bench with his, where his son would have been, except his son was out there playing and the man who was announcing the game said that, "There are three Burl Tolers here, starting with the senior."  And he said it over the microphone during the football game.  And he said, "Young Burl just ran out, number nine."  And grandpa couldn't see a thing by that time.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  Far left, Burl Jr., the center, Burl III when he was a senior at Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland [California] and on the far right, Burl Abron Toler, Sr., in front, Cameron Toler, who is now a junior at the University of California, and is on the football team, but did not play as much as Burl III played last year when he was number nine and was a senior, that was 1999.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  That was the famous football team of 1951, undefeated, untied and uninvited.  Burl Toler is in the center of the second line; to his left, fourth one in, is Ollie Matson who went on to become All-American, and there are some other people on there that could be recognized, among them is Bob St. Clair (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bob St. Clair.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  --and I can't point him out from here right now, but I think he's over there on the second row, third one in, next to Ollie, and then the other one was Gino Marchetti--
Speaker 1: Gino Marchetti.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  --and I can't tell you which one he is, but I think he's down front with--
Speaker 1: Gino.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  This is Goon down here with his face (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seems that way.
Speaker 2: (RENA BANCROFT):  --he's the local, local man down there that I call Goon, but I can't remember his name right now, but he lives here in the area.  Okay, that's Bill Henneberry [William Henneberry], number twenty-one, on the first, and he was part-time quarterback and he's the school--he was a school administrator here in San Francisco city schools [San Francisco Unified School District].  But you need to know St. Clair's on there because St. Clair went on to become All-American and I can't--
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  That's City College [City College of San Francisco, San Francisco, California].  That's when he was at City College.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (RENA BANCROFT):  That's City College.  He's on the bottom.  He played center, but he also played whatever position the coach needed to put him in because he was a versatile player, but he started as a center at City College.
