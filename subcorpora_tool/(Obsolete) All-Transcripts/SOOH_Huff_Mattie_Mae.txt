 Wilson  Today is Today is February 27, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson and I  am with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU  Library. I am in Tipton, Oklahoma at the home of Mattie Mae Huff. I  will be interviewing Mattie Mae today as part of the Spotlighting  Oklahoma oral history series. Thank you for having me here today.  Thank you.  I   d like to start out and have you tell me about where and when you were  born.  I was born north of town. This is where we   re talking about, Blue  District   well it   s Otter Creek. I was the tenth baby. (Laughter) Last of  ten children and I   m the only one left now.  And what year was that?  1915.  What kind of structure were you born in? Was it your family   s home?  It was an older house, but they built our new house the year I was born.  Momma kept a little diary and she had in there    We   re expecting a baby  in June    and sure enough, June came and I was born. The house was  finished by November that we lived in, for all my seventeen years that I  went before I married. (Laughs)  So how many bedrooms did your new house have?  Bathrooms?  Bedrooms.  5  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  We didn   t have bathrooms. Ours was outdoors. It had four bedrooms.  Okay. So tell me about the bathroom. (Laughs)  Well it was an outhouse.  How was bath time with ten kids?  The wash tubs was scattered here and there, heating the water out in the  sun. Well, we didn   t all get in the tubs, but we mostly had to just take a  little bath.  Sponge bath?  Yeah, sponge. When I would chop cotton though, we   d get in the creek  coming back home afterwards with our clothes on, thinking we was  getting a bath. Get home and just dry those clothes and wear them the  next day to chop cotton.  What were some of your chores growing up?  Well choppin    cotton and pickin    cotton and I didn   t have a lot around  the house. I wasn   t spoiled (laughs), but my older sisters did more  cooking, you know. Learned to cook quicker and some of them cleaned  house better. I just didn   t have a lot of chores, except Papa always made  us go to the field and do, you know, choppin    our cotton. It was our  farm. I didn   t get paid for it.  Did you have a big garden?  Oh yes, yes. Garden and orchard, too. I don   t think you could ever go to  our cellar that you didn   t find canned peaches, canned beans, all that  stuff. I helped with that some, and we had a big berry patch. We   d go  out there and pick those dew berries and there was this big old snake that  was curled up one day and all kind of eggs had been eaten   chicken  eggs.  Wow. What did you do with the snake?  Well, some of them killed it. I ran  (Laughter)  What were some of your favorite meals that your mom would make?  Beans and potatoes. Fried chicken, we always had plenty of chicken and  hams and stuff in our smokehouse. We had plenty to have meat, which  6  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  we don   t anymore.  So would they butcher the animals on your place?  Oh yes. The whole community came to our home. I say home  community, several different families would bring their hogs the same  day, you know, to butcher. We had a big old long vat that they always  put the hot water in. I just remember how they   d hang those hogs up and  strip their hides. Then they   d take stuff in and Mom would begin having  us grind the meat to make some sausage.  Did you eat that every morning?  Well, we did that several different times when they   d butcher. When we  made the sausage, Momma would make sacks. I think they were feed  sacks. We   d stuff that in those sacks, make a sack of sausage and hang it  in our smokehouse. We didn   t lack for food because she always had  something good to fix.  What would she make on a special occasion? Did she prepare anything  different on your birthday?  Oh. (Laughs) Usually, the last few years I always counted on berry  cobbler and fried chicken. That   d be about the first time the chickens  would be ready, was June. So I always counted on that for my birthday.  Did you help gather eggs?  Oh yes, yes, yes.  Did you milk the cows?  No. I tried (laughs), but I never could do that right. Momma made apple  butter and one of my brothers, that was his favorite dish was apple  butter. So that was Momma   s dish  pointing   that she used to put apple  butter in  and I   m still holding onto it. She made all kinds of jellies. She  was a working lady.  How much older was your oldest sibling?  Fourteen.  Fourteen years.  There were ten of us in fourteen years.  7  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wow.  We were divided up, five girls and five boys. Five were black headed. I  was black headed. You wouldn   t think so  I was. And five of them were  red headed.  Really? And what color hair did your parents have?  Momma had red hair and Papa had black until he got bald.  Did your grandparents live nearby?  I just had one grandparent that I ever knew. My mother   s mother lived  close to us. I remember going there when I was just, oh, about eight or  nine years old, with a cousin that I was a little older than. Grandma  would fix us a biscuit with sugar on it, you know. A biscuit and sugar,  but that   s the only grandparent.  How did your parents come to settle in this area?  You know, we talked about that yesterday. I don   t know. My mother   s  family came from Virginia. I really don   t know why. If she ever told me,  I just didn   t remember it. There were six sisters in her family and they  all stayed around here and married. Well, one never did marry. Aunt  Nora Abernathy and Aunt Sally Burke, they were Momma   s sisters over  in Altus.  So your Dad was always a farmer?  Yes, yes. Well he was an auctioneer, too.  Oh, okay. Would you ever go to the auctions?  Yes, I did. Not a lot. I didn   t get to go anywhere, but he went off to  school with Mr. Kinder from down around Frederick. They went to  school for auctioneering, so he did that quite a lot.  Was he also a veterinarian?  Well, he didn   t study that, but everybody thought he was good on his  cattle and anything else that needed work on.  So would they bring their cattle to him?  Yes, some of them did.  8  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Would you get together with the neighbors very often?  Oh, quite a bit. My parents, they played Forty-Two way back and that   s  when I learned to play. I was still young. My parents and couples from  the community would get together and would just play Forty-Two, with  dominoes, you know. That   s still what I want to play. (Laughter)  My grandma taught me how to play Forty-Two.  Marvin, the night before last they were over here, my son, and I said,    If  ya   ll would stay longer, we might just play some Forty-Two.    Well,  none of them were interested in it. I just love it and I miss it because we  had couples around here after we   d been married and after I was even a  widow, we had people that we still played Forty-Two with.  Would there be an ice man that came around?  Yes, yes there was.  Did you ever get to have ice cream?  Oh, lots of times, yes. We had plenty of milk, you know. Momma had a  separator and they would run that through and we had cream and they  would make ice cream. I was telling this to somebody the other day. I  remember on Momma   s birthday, July the fifteenth, one time my older  sister, they were running the separator and she began hollering,    Papa,  we   re having ice cream for Momma   s birthday     Well, she could hear it.  She thought she was hollering to keep her from hearing. (Laughter)     We   re having ice cream tonight for Momma   s birthday     That was a  long time ago.  Did your mom make all the clothes for the kids?  Well not all of them, but we didn   t have very many bought ones either.  Hand-me-downs, I think I got mostly the hand-me-downs because I was  the youngest girl.  Well tell me about going to school.  Well, I was the smartest one in the eighth grade. I was the only one   (Laughter) I tell that to my kids. I was the only one that graduated that  year from the eighth grade. It was just a one-room school that had up  through eighth grade.  What was it called?  9  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Blue District 86.  How old were you when you started the school?  Well I must have been six.  And would you have to walk very far?  (Laughs) Well, we didn   t call it long. We had two different routes we  could go. One way around the creek this way was one bridge or around  this way was another bridge. It was about the same distance, but it  wasn   t too far. I remember walking with my older sisters and we had a  neighbor family that they began calling my sister    red headed  peckerwood.    I didn   t like that whatsoever (laughs), but that   s when I  was pretty young.  So what did you do about it?  I didn   t do anything.  Would you bring your lunch to school?  Yes, in a little bucket or a sack. We had two cloak rooms, one for the  boys and one for the girls to put their wraps and their food in. Yeah, we  carried our lunch there.  Did you have a favorite subject in school?  Well, I was good at a lot of them. (Laughs) Gotta brag a little. I don   t  know. I always liked arithmetic, which I don   t do good now. We used to  have what they called siphon matches. They   d choose up and we   d get to  go to the blackboard and spell out names, you know. So I was good at  that.  Would you have a recess and play games at the school?  We did.  What were some of the games?  (Laughs) I played baseball with the boys. They let us all play together  just at recess and at noon time. But no, we had games and I always had  good teachers. I always loved my teachers.  Was there anyone in the area that had musical instruments? Was music  important?  10  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  I don   t remember that they did. My family wasn   t very musical, I know  that. No, I don   t think of any family that did.  Did your mother quilt?  Oh, yes. We used to piece quilts and I helped a little bit on quilting, but I  wouldn   t let people see my stitches (laughs) because I wasn   t as good as  the older people.  What did you do after high school?  I just came to high school two years. Our bus didn   t come but out here  two miles north or three miles north of town. It didn   t come to our place  and my sister and two other girls had already graduated. We had a car  pool and when they graduated, that just left me. Papa didn   t see a big  need for me to come to school, but I tried staying for awhile with my  aunt. Momma said,    No, my baby is not going to stay away from home.     That was my junior year, so that   s when I dropped out.  Did your older siblings move away from home after high school or did  they stick around?  Well, one of them married way before I did. And my older sister went  away to college and then she taught school a little bit. She was gone a lot  before I was away from home.  So what did you do then after you were finished with school?  I still worked in the field. (Laughs) I picked cotton the day before we got  married   How did you meet your husband?  Well, he moved here from down in Texas. They had relatives here and  they thought people were doing well around Tipton, so they moved here.  They had a big family and so I met them right away through their  relatives  who  lived by us. Actually, at first I would say,    Richard or  Frank, whichever you are.    They were brothers. I didn   t know which  one, and I married Richard (laughter), but that was at first. I thought they  favored and not knowing them anyway. There   s been a joke going  around that his mother told him one day something, teasing him about  me. He said,    That little freckle-faced, black-headed girl.    Then he  married me. He was six years older.  How old were you when you got married?  11  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Seventeen, a little past, from June to October past.  Tell me about your wedding ceremony.  (Laughs) We went one afternoon to a Baptist preacher   s house in  Frederick, Richard and I and two of his sisters and my one sister. Just  went to his home and got married. (Laughs) Then we left, Richard and I,  in our car and went through town. He bought some hot tamales off the  street. We ate those in the car and come on back to Tipton and he bought  us some ice cream cones. (Laughter) Then from there we went to his  folks to visit, just a little bit out north of town, and then we wound up  staying all night at my folk   s. That was the honeymoon.  When did you have a house of your own?  Well, let   s see. We married in    32. It was    34 before we really had a  house. We lived with his folks awhile and then we lived at his brother   s  house for awhile. Then we finally lived on Jack Pensen   s place out here,  in a little two-room house.  So do you remember much dust rolling through this area?  Yes, I do.  Will you tell me about some of that?  Well, I already told you about it getting in our house. (Laughs) I  remember how the men would have to run to the field to take their plows  to try to stop it, you know. Keep the land from blowing too much. My  husband was just a farm worker, farm wages all those years until he  bought land later of his own. He just worked wages and not very high  wages.  Will you tell me again about it getting into your house? The recorder  wasn   t on when we were talking about the dust coming in your house.  Oh, well it got so bad out there on the Base Line Road that we just had  to move furniture out to the porch, practically, to be able to clean the  house inside. It was just dust everywhere, dirt.  So would you have to clean every day?  Well we had dust nearly all the time. You couldn   t ever tell when you  dusted anything (laughs), but no, it didn   t blow that bad all the time. It  was just that one big sandstorm and I couldn   t tell you what year that  12  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  was.  Did you feel the effects of the Depression?  Not really. I remember having to get, well what did we get to buy stuff?  Oh, rations?  Yeah. They rationed us on several things, but no, it didn   t affect us a  whole lot.  What kind of car did you have?  (Laughs) A Model-T Ford. I think that   s it. That   s one of them. This   referring to photograph  was a few days after we were married. We had  already gone to pick cotton and that   s the back of his car. He   d make  about five and a quarter a week and we   d come to town on Saturday  night and eat us some hamburgers here. I think we had them three for a  quarter and then we would buy groceries, would have to make out what  we could buy and then we   d have to save enough for gas for the next  week, out of that  5.25,  5.50, whatever.  Did you grow much of a garden yourself?  Yes, I did.  Did you can your food also?  I used to make pickles and do things like that, but not in recent years.  Were any of your family members involved with World War I?  No, no.  What about World War II?  Well, I   ve had some nephews and things that went to service, but no, I  never had any of my immediate family. We were afraid Lonnie, my  youngest son, was going to be drafted. He and Jack Broad and David  Gore were all born in September. We were afraid every one of them   would be . Jack did have to go, Jack Broad. Lonnie escaped, didn   t  have to go.  Did you hear much about WPA projects in the area?  Yes, my husband worked on that up in Snyder.  13  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  What kind of project was it?  It   s on the mountain. I guess just hauling rocks around. He   d leave home  to go up there with a group and they   d work all day long.  How much would they make?  I don   t remember. It wasn   t much.  But it was helpful. Did you listen to the radio?  Yes, quite often.  Do you remember any certain programs?  Saturday night I always had to listen to, was it the Grand Ole Opry?  Yeah. Anything with music on it. I wasn   t talented for music. (Laughs) I  just liked to hear it.  Did the town ever have dances or did neighbors hold anything like that?  Oh, in our community there was a lot of us about the same. Well, about  four families that had four children each and we had parties where we  square danced. We called it just a game, but we   d go to different homes.  One of my brothers gave me my sixteenth birthday party and we just had  a square dance at his house.  Were there any other annual events in the community?  Well, there was an annual picnic down here in Tipton every summer,  about August. My daddy for some reason wanted to and down at our  deal one day he got us all together, our whole family, and had us march  to the drugstore, get an ice cream, and come back. He thought it was so  nice and I did, too. Of course, we started out girl and boy, girl and boy.  We had lost the oldest child when she was five years old, but my brother  had already married, so that left him a woman. So it was boy, girl, boy,  girl, boy, girl. I thought it was a lot of fun, but since then I used to hear  my sisters say,    Oh, wasn   t that embarrassing?     What would you all do for Christmas?  I   d hunt for my doll in the closet. (Laughs) Momma would sometimes  take some of us on a train to Altus. It went over there and back.  What would you do in Altus?  14  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Shop. Shop for something, but no, we didn   t have a big Christmas. We  always had plenty to eat, fixed meals, but as far as giving gifts and  things, we just didn   t have that much.  How has the community of Tipton changed over the years?  Oh, it   s changed a lot. We had about three theaters here at one time. We  had as many as five cotton gins. We don   t have any of that now and we  have one grocery store. It   s changed a lot with, you know, and I don   t  know about population. If we didn   t count out here in the  Tipton  Home  and all that, we wouldn   t have much for town. They do come and go  more than they used to. I used to think I knew everybody in town and I  don   t anymore. Some come here for awhile, teachers you know. A lot of  teachers don   t stay long, school teachers. So, not like it used to be.  Did home demonstration agents used to visit your home?  After I was married, yeah. I was a member of what we call Victory  Home Demonstration and some of us was here, some lived at Manitou,  in the country, and one lady lived in Frederick. We   d have monthly  meetings at different homes and on one meeting in Frederick we always  quilted on a quilt to have for somebody, you know, that lost their house  or got married or something.  Did you have a primary home demonstration agent?  Well, Micah Treadwell is still there now. There was a black one. I can   t  think of her given name, but way back there. Then a Ms. Cole. I can   t  recall all their names, but yeah, they used to come to our meetings, you  know. And we had a pretty good club, but we finally lost so many and  they were dying off and we decided to dissolve. We had a quilt on hand  at that time. We had a pretty quilt that we had made and each one had  put in a block and I really quilted on one corner of that. When we  dissolved, well that president thought we should do something with the  quilt and they thought maybe just sell it and give the money to the 4-H.  Well, I bought it myself. I bought it for  200. (Laughs) Lonnie begged  for it. I don   t know how many times he said,    Mother, that quilt   s up in  the closet. It   s not doing you any good. Why don   t you let me have it?     Finally I sold it to him for seventy-five dollars. I took some money for it.  Maybe I just gave  100, but anyway I sold it to him. It was yellow, but  he   s still got that on his bed. I saw it the other day. He just liked it. I  don   t know why. And I did kind of hang onto things, not wanting to  wear them out.  Tell me about your children. How many children did you have?  15  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Three. She   s my oldest,  Ladine,  and then I have two boys,  Marvin and  Lonnie . Six years difference in each one of them.  And you stayed home with them when they were children?  Yeah.  When did you start working outside of the home?  Oh, well thirty-eight years ago is when I started being treasurer down  here. Thirty-eight years.  What inspired you to take that job?  My neighbor, Dale Hasley. He was on the board. He was the clerk and  he just came over to my house one evening and he said,    We   re looking  for a treasurer.    I think more or less, she just quit and he said,    Would  you like that kind of job?    Well, of course I did. I wanted a job.  (Laughs) Thirty-five dollars a month, started out at thirty-five. He said,     Well, I   m going to tell them.    Of course he was just the clerk, but he  told the council and the next month they called me in, first of January, to  take it. So I wound up there that long.  So you really enjoyed it?  I did. I really did.  What all did you do there?  Well, I signed checks the first few years. We would have firemen   s  checks, retired firemen. We had several from Tipton, and even if the  man had passed away the woman still drew a check. Well, I   d make  those checks out and deliver them to the house purposely just to go to  the house. Then I   d just sign checks a lot of times and I had an airport  that I had to keep up the records on it, but it got to where I didn   t have a  lot to do.  And you retired when?  January of this year.  Did they have a big party for you?  I got that big blanket and I don   t know how I did without it because here  lately I   ve had to get up in the night with my toe hurting.  16  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  It   s an electric blanket and it really keeps you warm.  Yeah. Then they gave me a plaque and roses. I got roses, but they   re  already gone now. They had a big party for me down here.  The plaque says,    In recognition of service and dedication, the town  Board of Trustees from the town of Tipton present this plaque to Mattie  Mae Huff as a token of appreciation for thirty-eight years of serving  Tipton as town treasurer. It is with great pride and honor that we say  thank you. Respectfully, the Board of Trustees.     And then there   s a plaque over there. The city manager over at Frederick  went to Oklahoma City and took this to have it signed and brought it  here to the house to me.  Oh, how nice.  So I thought I really had it made.  The plaque reads,    This is on behalf of the Oklahoma Municipal  League. We   d like to recognize Mattie Mae Huff, treasurer, on account  of Tipton, Oklahoma, for your hard work and devotion to the town of  Tipton. Your public service for the past thirty-eight years speaks highly  of your dedication to your community. Your great attitude and friendly  manner towards the citizens of your community have made you a  valuable asset to the town. Your record of elected service reflects the  trust the citizens of Tipton have in you. Your tenure and age on your  retirement together are likely a record for an Oklahoma official. We  wish you the best in your retirement.     She just put that in the frame the other day.  Well how does it feel to possibly be the oldest elected official in the state  of Oklahoma?  Feels like I   m old (laughter), but actually I wasn   t sure whether that was  right. I guess everybody knew at that age that I was the oldest and see, I  had an opponent two different years when I ran and I beat them both out.  (Laughter)  Was your campaign very extensive?  The first one wasn   t, but then the second was. I just knew I would not  win because it was a younger woman. Well, she may have needed it  more than I did and I just knew she had beaten me. I think I beat her by  17  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  119. So anyway, it   s been luck for me.  So how old were you in 1973 when you started?  I hadn   t figured up how old I was, but I already had grandchildren at that  time.  Probably around fifty-eight.   So what   s your secret to being so active and being ninety-five?  I guess just being silly. (Laughter) Mostly silly and having a good time. I  don   t know. I   ve tried to be a friend to everybody and I want everybody  to be my friend.  And you   re pretty involved in your church?  Yes.  Which church is that?  Baptist. We lost our preacher. Broke my heart. He   s gone to Lawton to  go to another church. He   d been here nine and a half years, and also, I   m  the oldest member of the church. I   ve been a member for eighty-five  years. Since I was ten years old, I   ve been a member.  So you know a lot of church history, too.  Yeah. We get that in our little magazine all the time. But someone is  always asking if somebody knows a certain question and sometimes I   ve  answered them for them. (Laughs)  So do you keep up with much gossip around Tipton?  Yes. I go to the beauty shop. (Laughter)  Well in the past ninety-five years, what would you say is the greatest  invention? I know there have been a lot.  (Laughs) I couldn   t pinpoint one unless it would be health wise. You  know, all the different things you can be cured for nowadays, but I don   t  know actually.  What does it mean to you to be an Oklahoman?  I wouldn   t be anything else  I mentioned I haven   t lived more than nine  miles from where I was born.  18  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  Huff  Have you traveled very much further than that?  Yes, my youngest son took me on several summer trips. He and I  together went to Hawaii one year.  Wow.  Had a big blast. Saw so many things, you know. He just wanted to take  me. Of course, I did my part of my expense. And he wanted me to go to  New York one year because he was taking the two girls and I said,    Oh,  don   t take those girls to New York.    Then he said,    Well, would you  like to go?    I think he wanted me to go so I could kindly watch after  them, but we had a great time there, too.  Great. Well can you think of any more stories you   d like to share about  anything?  I may have stories. (Laughter)  I   m sure you have a lot of good stories.  Well I think that and what was already in the papers. We lived out here  north of town, about a mile north and then a little west. One time I saved  up my eggs and my cousin was having a baby shower and I brought  those eggs, walked across the field, brought them to the grocery store,  sold them for a quarter and went and bought little booties for a baby  shower and walked back home. (Laughter)  Was that a friend   s baby?  Well it was a cousin of mine, but I don   t know. I got out and did a lot of  things. And about the garden, I made a garden up until the last few  years. I was showing them last night I dug up a half dollar out here when  I was putting in a tomato plant one time. It   s not the metal of what our  half dollars are now. I   m wondering if it might be valuable. Marvin said  last night,    Oh yeah, it   s worth fifty cents.    (Laughter)  How long have you lived in this house?  Since    80. May of 1980.  Well when history is written about you, what would you like for it to  say?  That she   s a great old lady. (Laughter) I don   t know what you   d wanna  say about me. I   ve just enjoyed life. I still do. I get kindly down and out  19  Wilson  Huff  Wilson  when my legs don   t get well. I told somebody I knew I   d get old, but  didn   t know it was gonna be this soon  (Laughter) I guess as much as  two years back I was still really active, still driving my car and I guess  I   d still drive if she  Ladine  wasn   t here to drive for me.  Well I want to thank you for letting me come here and talk to you today.  It   s been a pleasure.  Well, I   m sorry I choke up, but it   s been a pleasure to know you.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
