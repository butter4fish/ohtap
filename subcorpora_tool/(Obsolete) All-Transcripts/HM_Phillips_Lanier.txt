Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: --Recife [Brazil].  That was the naval base, Recife, and Rio, Rio de Janeiro [Brazil].
Speaker 1: What did you like about Brazil?
Speaker 2: Oh I like Brazil because I didn't find too much racism then and I just like the culture and liked the people of who I--the last time I was there, I noticed Rio is changing so much, especially up on the hills, you know or what, it's all right if you're down around Copacabana [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil] or what, but you go up on the hills somewhat.  When I go to those places, I always take the train or bus and go out with, you know, meet some lady friends of that country and go out away from the cities and things and I enjoy myself much better that way.
Speaker 1: Very good.  Do you have a favorite time of the year, a season?
Speaker 2: No.  All the seasons are okay with me, I find something to do in all the seasons.  Lived in Boston [Massachusetts] for a long time so the cold weather doesn't bother, being born in the South, the hot weather doesn't bother, so, it's fine.

Story_ID: 531532
Speaker 1: I want to find out about your family.  Tell me about your parents, what are their names?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother's name was, maiden name was Celvia, C-E-L-V-I-A, Celvia Woodall [Celvia Woodall Phillips], W-O-O-D-A-L-L, and my father's name was Harvie Phillips, but he spelled it H-A-R-V-I-E (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you know where they were born and when they were born?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they both were born in, my mother's born in 1905, and I'm not sure when my father was born, but they both were born in Lithonia, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Did they tell you any stories about growing up and about the family?  What about your mom, tell me about your mom's family?
Speaker 2: Oh well, I know very little about my mom's family, her father was Ed Woodall, and I think he was from a place called Greene County, Georgia, excuse me.  And his mother was a mulatto from Virginia or what, from what I can understand and find out that, he was a Caucasian, and my mother--
Speaker 1: That Ed was?
Speaker 2: Ed Woodall.
Speaker 1: Ed was Caucasian, your mother's father?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's father.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And her mother Flossie Woodall was of Indian [Native American] heritage, you know, and African American, or what, and they had nine children and I know some of them, of his children, if you look at their race, it'd be white and some, (laughter) you know, is Negro or what and--
Speaker 1: So this is the children of Ed Woodall and Flossie?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They had nine kids and some of them--
Speaker 2: Well they had, yeah, they had ten, make that ten, instead of nine.
Speaker 1: And some of the kids were white?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And some identified as African American (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --black?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: All very--
Speaker 2: Yeah they--
Speaker 1: --light skinned?
Speaker 2: --they, oh extremely light skinned and blue eyes, you know, all, every one of his children were extremely light skinned, there's no way to tell of the straight hair, you know.  And the youngest, only two of his children [sic.] are still living, one is in Detroit [Michigan], twins, Louis [Louis Woodall] and Lois [Lois Woodall].  Now, Lois is in Detroit and her identification is black, African American, but her twin brother is white, if you look at his, he lives in Chicago [Illinois].  If you look at his driver's license, whatever, it'll say, you know, white, Caucasian.  Well, you can't dispute it by looking, you know, and well that's one of the traits of white.
Speaker 1: Does he claim his sister and claim (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes--
Speaker 1: --the family?
Speaker 2: Yes, he goes to see them or what, it's at one time, well he's married to an African American now, but he was married to a Caucasian girl and I guess for some reason, he changed his mind and wanted to be with African Americans, you know?
Speaker 1: Did your mom tell you stories about her gran- her parents and her grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yeah well I knew both, I knew Flossie and Ed Woodall, I can remember, I can remember when she died, and Ed Woodall in DeKalb County [Georgia], he had a rock quarry and he owned quite a bit of property, he died in 1939, she died some years before and after that the children began to migrate to different places throughout the United States.
Story_ID: 531533
Speaker 1: Flossie and Ed [Phillips' maternal grandparents, Flossie Woodall and Ed Woodall], they were in Georgia?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How were they treated by the white people in their town?
Speaker 2: They were treated as black, they were treated as black people, but Ed Woodall, he owned a lot of property, but after he had died, they began to take the property.  I know one place, what is now Dean Court [Lithonia, Georgia], he said he owed three years' taxes, and they foreclosed I think for a dollar and a half and the children protested and they went to court and they lost it all.  And the school that they built on Bruce Street, the board of education put twenty-two thousand dollars into escrow with the county and said, give it to the rightful owner, and they notified the children, Ed Woodall's children, and they came and when they went to court they had, James Venable, who was the grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] in Georgia, and had to represent them and what they did is they gave half to the City of Lithonia [Georgia], half to some other Klansman, not Venable.
Speaker 1: Do you know around what time this was?  What year?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I believe this is around 1950, around 1950.  And I think Cory Ellert [ph.], was one of the fellows' name that got, you know, some of the property or what and they built projects on it, you know and then they built a school because the old, the original school--they built in '39 [1939]--now is some kind of historical site that they don't want to tear it down.  But I remember because, but I had gone to Tennessee, Chattanooga [Tennessee] to go to school after they burned--Yellow River [Yellow River School, Lithonia, Georgia] was the name of the school.  The reason they named it Yellow River was because the Yellow River ran through Gwinnett [Gwinnett County, Georgia], DeKalb [DeKalb County, Georgia] and Rockdale County [Georgia] and children from those three counties went to school at Yellow River, see?
Speaker 1: And so, and this, this happened in the 1930s?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: That they burned the school?
Speaker 2: Oh no, in the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: In the '20s [1920s]?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes [sic. 1935].
Story_ID: 531534
Speaker 1: Let me just find out about your father's [Harvie Phillips] side of the family?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What's his, what are his parents' names?
Speaker 2: His mother's name was Adeline Phillips.
Speaker 1: Do you know when she was born or where?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She was born in 1852, and died 1941.
Speaker 1: And did she also live in Georgia?
Speaker 2: In Georgia.  And her husband, which was my father's father was Eli Phillips, I don't know his age, but I do know they both were slaves and their owner's name was Phillips, so when they got married, they--as they say, when they jumped over the broom, they didn't have to change no name or nothing because both of 'em's name was Phillips.  And that's where, you know, my father was born in Lithonia [Georgia] and all and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so--
Speaker 2: --my--
Speaker 1: They were born, they were born slaves?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you hear stories about their childhood?
Speaker 2: Oh yes--
Speaker 1: Slavery?
Speaker 2: --my great-grandmother [sic. grandmother], Adeline, I can remember she used to sit me on the floor and tell all about it.  She had a friend where the right hand of the four fingers were missing, and they just had the thumb and the hand, they said she stole some bread and some meat from the big house and they cut the four fingers off, and they said the reason they don't cut the, they never cut the whole hand off, because if they cut the hand off they couldn't work.  But if they just left the thumb and finger, they could work, and if the slave men would try to run away, they would cut the foot just back of the toes, and not the whole foot because they could still work in the fields or what, you know?  And that's why they didn't cut the whole foot off, say they never cut the whole foot off or what.  And they would explain all of that to me, and they would explain even all about sex to me or what, and the young girls, they would say, once they would reach womanhood or what, you'd have to take her to the slave master and you would have to rub honeysuckle flowers all over them so they would smell good, you know?  And they would take 'em to the slave master and, for him to have sex with them.
Speaker 1: This (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or what.
Speaker 1: --was a rite of passage?  This was a rite of passage?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: For all young women?
Speaker 2: Yes, all young women.  And if they had lost their virginity, when you took 'em he had, somebody, some slave man would get a whipping for bothering them before the slave master got her, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the slave master?
Speaker 2: Phillips.
Speaker 1: It was also--do you know his full name by chance?  Do you know his first name?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't, but I know he owned both my great-grandmother and grandfather, and his name was Phillips.  But I do know there's a Phillips Road in Georgia now, there in Redan, Georgia, runs from Decatur [Georgia] to Redan, Phillips Road or what.
Speaker 1: Do you know of any of the slave women who had children by the slave master, Phillips?
Speaker 2: No but they say they had a lot of 'em in the, what I understand is he might have been my great-grandmother's father or what.
Speaker 1: So you might be a descendent of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I might be--
Speaker 1: --slave master--
Speaker 2: --a descendant of him, you know?  Yes.
Speaker 1: Have they told you stories about other ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well no.  They, I know it was a lot of them and they migrated, some went to Buffalo, New York, Birmingham, Alabama, and St. Louis, Missouri, and places like that.  And Phillips, I think my great-grandmother, Eli and Adeline, I think they had about ten children you know?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my grandfather, my father's mother and father stayed right there in Lithonia, yeah.  And I know--
Speaker 1: And raise their families?
Speaker 2: I know Aunt Effie [Effie Phillips], and she married a Lucius Roddy [ph.] and Maggie [Maggie Phillips]--or what, I have pictures of the family but not here.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I have 'em in Georgia.
Story_ID: 531535
Speaker 1: Well Adeline and Eli [Phillips' paternal grandparents, Adeline Phillips and Eli Phillips] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Both were--
Speaker 1: --were alive during emancipation?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Did they tell stories about emancipation?
Speaker 2: No, they never told me that.  The only thing they, they told me was, seemed like all negative things, you know?  She'd tell me to never look the white man in the eye, you know, or I'll get a whipping, you know?  And never dispute him regardless to what he said, or what, if I--because they would lynch me or beat me, or what say, and I might as well, you know, never look him in the eye, and say, yes sir, regardless to the age.  Say if I, you could be twenty-five years old, and a five year old white boy, you would say, yes sir, and you know, mister you know, things like that.  Now I do remember as a child I would go uptown, they had a place where you could buy ice cream but they had a little store there you could get jaw breakers for a penny, they call 'em jaw breakers, candy.  And I would go up and a little white boys my age would come and kick me on the leg and say, nigger, nigger, nigger, and spit on me and I couldn't do anything and their parents would laugh and you know, look at 'em and laugh and like you say, come on, you know, or what, but I couldn't say anything because I knew if I did they'd whip me, you know?  So, that's the way it was.
Speaker 1: So you were born in Lithonia, Georgia, this was all happening in Lithonia?
Speaker 2: In Lithonia, yes.
Speaker 1: In DeKalb County [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: DeKalb County.
Speaker 1: Do you have other memories of, of that kind of treatment as a young boy?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Oh yes, I was told about Charlie Mitchell [Charles Mitchell], that was the last lynching they had in Lithonia, his name was Charlie Mitchell, and what happened was a group of white men attempted to whip him, and he bit one who owned the bank, I.M. Starr was his name, bit his ear off.  And he got away, and he made it up to what is now Coffee Road, and out in the middle of the field they would have the house called the cotton house, and he got in the cotton house, they couldn't find him, they got the dogs trying to track him or what.  And the next morning, you saw this black fellow coming down, what is now, Lithonia, Redan Road, and he whistled and called him and said, "Go to Decatur [Georgia] and get the sheriff to come and get me," he said, "because they're gonna kill me if they find me."  And he came down to Lithonia and sat on that rock wall where the train comes by at eight o'clock in the morning, come back at five in the evening and he told the police down there and they went up and got him and naturally killed him and tied him by his feet and drug him up and down Main Street.  Well the street was made out of what we call cobblestones, about twelve inches long and about four inches wide, you know, put down on the street and they drug him back and forth, you know, and people come out and spit on him and things like that.  And, but I remember the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] coming down where we lived in Brewster's Alley [ph.] and everybody would pull their shades down, they had the green shades, pull their shades down and, and they would kick the door in or what, you could hear 'em they'd shoot in the air, you know?  Say, "What are you doing up this late," you know?  Because you had to go to work and the rock quarries are in the fields, you know, at daybreak.  And as a child, I would crawl under the bed, you know?
Speaker 1: So this happened actually at your home?  They were kicking the door?
Speaker 2: Oh?  Out, out in Brewster's Alley they did, but I don't recall them kicking our door in.  We lived in a little two room house and, but I would peep out of the window at them.  And, I did see them whip a man called Boise Shepard [ph.], and because what they were doing, the cotton house in the middle of the cotton field, as the people picked the cotton, the end of the rolls, they would dump it out in the big baskets and then the--he would pick up on the wagons and put it in the cotton house until he'd get enough to, bails to take to the cotton gin, and he didn't go to work that day, so somebody who picked cotton had to take that job, driving the wagon, you know, the mule and wagon that do it.  And he said he was sick.  Well I knew the man was sick 'cause my mother [Celvia Woodall Phillips] had given him some castor oil and, they whipped him, made him lay over the log, they whipped him and I watched that and I just had fear, you know, of the Ku Klux Klan.
Speaker 1: Did they come in wearing their garb?  The, the white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes--
Speaker 1: --robes?
Speaker 2: --some would have them, some wouldn't and I, I knew some of 'em, well everybody was a Klan.  All the white people were Klan, you know?  The store was, owner was Klan, they had one policeman, he was a Klan, and any white person could arrest any black person, you know?
Story_ID: 531536
Speaker 1: Sir, you were talking about the KKK [Ku Klux Klan].  You said all white men in town were members of the KKK?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was the breakdown racially?
Speaker 2: Percentage, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Was it sort of half and half?
Speaker 2: It seems like it was maybe 50/50, it was a lot of black people, you know, there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you--
Speaker 2: --or what.
Speaker 1: --remember how old you were when you witnessed these things?
Speaker 2: Oh, I must have been about six, five or six years old.
Speaker 1: So this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) from then on--
Speaker 1: --is the late 1920s?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When this was going on?
Speaker 2: Yes, in the late '20s [1920s], that's when they burned the school, I think they burned the school in '29 [sic. 1935].
Speaker 1: So tell me about that situation, this--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --was the--
Speaker 2: --well--
Speaker 1: --Yellow River School [Lithonia, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yellow River, that was the name of the school.  It was behind Union Baptist Church [Union Missionary Baptist Church, Lithonia, Georgia], what is now Pendley Street.  And they, after that, they didn't have school for blacks, what would happen, they would go to Atlanta [Georgia] or Decatur [Georgia] and they would find someone to, that could read or what and they would come down at the church and they would teach there at the church.  You could go and they would teach you, you know, simple arithmetic, you know, or what and mostly they do, would sing 'Down by the Riverside,' "They ain't gonna study war no more," I remember those songs quite well.  And then they had a school up at Panola Road, in Decatur and they charged twenty-five cents a week, a fellow used to take three of us up there to school, and the teachers name was Ms. Rainwater.  But about a block down, they have a lake there now, I, just last month I was down there and I just went down, and those memories, you know, came back.  And the Juehands [ph.], the African American family, I think they had about eighteen children and they, they would pick one of their older girls and they would bring all the ones who was too young to work, you know, in the fields to school and it was only about the size of this room, that was the whole school and they would be crying and there, you know, they'd change diapers and all of that.  And it was really wasn't a school, you couldn't learn anything.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the teachers?
Speaker 2: The teachers name was Ms. Rainwater.
Speaker 1: And was she the only teacher?
Speaker 2: She was the only teacher, one teacher, that's all one teacher.  Now Yellow River, I think they, one teacher's name was Ms. Brown [ph.], and Ms. Fleming [ph.], I think they had a two or three teachers.
Speaker 1: So when did you go from this one room where everybody was coming in and out, to Yellow River School?  When was that built?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to Yellow River first and then after the Ku Klux Klan burned the school down, then I went to, to Big Miller Grove [Big Miller Grove Missionary Baptist Church, Lithonia, Georgia] they call it.
Speaker 1: Well let's talk about that.  That you said it happened around 1929?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-nine [1929].
Speaker 1: And you remember witnessing this?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me what you saw?
Speaker 2: Well, they say the school, they burning the school and then everybody was saying that everybody went out on the rock and stood up and they were standing and crying, I remember I was crying and, and I heard one of the older people say, they'll never let us learn to read or what.  And I recall many times, seeing the school buses bringing white kids to school because the school, the white school was right in Lithonia [Georgia] there in town and they would bring 'em they had buses, you know, bringing the white kids in and if you'd be walking along, they would, the bus driver would go over and make you get over in the ditch, it's all dirt roads and you'd have to jump in the ditch almost, you know, he'd try to act like he's gonna run over you, or might would have if you didn't jump in the ditch, you know, and things?  So that's the way it was and--
Speaker 1: And they burned it at night?  Did anyone witness?  Does anyone know exactly who burned the school?  Was this just, for sure the KKK?
Speaker 2: Well everybody knew it was the, the Klan, the Ku Klux Klan, yes.
Speaker 1: And it happened at night?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Well, the thing is, they, they had a big water tank and even in 1977, when I came back to Georgia, they had a big iron water tank and the top of that tank, they had a big Confederate flag, you know, painted on there, or what.  And I used to look at, you know, and the cotton gin, the cotton gin was right behind it, you know?
Speaker 1: That flag had been there for a number of years?
Speaker 2: Yeah well, when I went back in '77 [1977], that had been a long time, you know, since I'd been to Lithonia, I didn't go back for many years, you know?  What I did, after I lost my first ship, the Truxtun [USS Truxtun (DD-229)].
Story_ID: 531537
Speaker 1: And so Yellow River School [Lithonia, Georgia] was burned down around 1929 [sic. 1935]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And was there aftermath?  Were there, you know, protests or that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Well if you did, you'd just get a whipping or go to jail.  See, if they could put you in jail, and I know a lot of people went to jail,  but they only went to jail on weekends because they worked, you know, on the quarry or on the farm all day, you know, and then they'd let 'em go home on the weekends, they'd go to jail or at night and when they, they'd go to jail, they would tell you how long you were gonna get in jail when they arrest you, you know?
Speaker 1: But there's was no trial?
Speaker 2: There's no trial, they just tell you, okay you've got six months or six weeks, or something like that.
Speaker 1: Who was the sheriff?
Speaker 2: Hubert Dave [ph.] first, and then Wright Howard [ph.], you know.
Speaker 1: What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They--
Speaker 1: --kind of guys were these?
Speaker 2: --they had one, one sheriff, Cory Ellert [ph.], this was after I had left Lithonia [Georgia] and, but I found out about him, he was illiterate.  So, if he'd stop you, he said, "I'm gonna arrest you, write your name down, can you write?"  And if you said yes, he'd make you write on the ticket, you know?
Speaker 1: Well, the black kids did learn to read and write then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, they, they learned.  They were so hungry for an education, I know I was, I wanted to go to school so bad and I wanted to learn so bad.  Now my [maternal] grandfather's [Ed Woodall] oldest daughter, Debra [Debra Woodall (ph.)], she had moved to Tennessee, and I went to Chattanooga [Tennessee] to go to school and I went to elementary school, Main Street Elementary School [West Main Street School, Chattanooga, Tennessee], then went to junior high, East Fifth Street [East Fifth Street Junior High School, Chattanooga, Tennessee].
Story_ID: 531538
Speaker 1: Wait, so you were, so you moved--you actually went to school outside of Lithonia [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: --so what year?  What year did you move?
Speaker 2: I think around 1930, let's see, around '32 [1932], '33 [1933], somewhere in there.  I went to Chattanooga, and I we--
Speaker 1: Now did the whole family go?  Or you just went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No--
Speaker 1: --and stayed--
Speaker 2: --I had--
Speaker 1: --with relatives?
Speaker 2: --a not, I had a relative that lived there and I went and lived with her, and went to Main Street [West Main Street School, Chattanooga, Tennessee] and then I went back to Lithonia.
Speaker 1: So, who was the aunt you stayed with in Chattanooga?
Speaker 2: My aunt, Ed Woodall's oldest child.  She was born in 1896.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Debra [Debra Woodall (ph.)], Debra, they called her Debra, she had three children, and I, I just about grew up with them.
Speaker 1: And so, tell me about the school, the school there, Main Street?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, yeah, elementary school it was, it was really something new to me, you know, it was a good size school, you know, and something new and then I went back to Georgia, and then I went back and went to East Fifth Street Junior High School [Chattanooga, Tennessee].  And I graduated from East Fifth Street Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Were you?  Did you excel in Chattanooga?  Was it a different situation than in Lithonia, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, altogether different.  Of course, they had discrimination, all black schools, and my grandfather's youngest daughter and son was there and Lois [Lois Woodall], she and I was walking down the street one day and the police came and, and arrested her, and--because they thought she was white, you know, and she was with me, or what and they said, "What are you doing with the nigger, or what?"  And she said, "That's my nephew," she's only two years older than I, "And so we're taking you to jail," they said, "and him too."  And they told me, they said, "You get out of here, you can't," they said, "you go now."  And so I left, you know?  And my aunt, I ran and told my aunt and she went up to the jail and she looked like she was white too and got her out of jail, they let her go.
Speaker 1: So, did the white people in Chattanooga believe your aunt and cousins, did they believe they were a white family?
Speaker 2: Well no.  Not after they arrest them, because they told them they weren't white.
Speaker 1: But before that, they thought this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --white--
Speaker 2: --yeah--
Speaker 1: --family--
Speaker 2: --oh yes, yes, yes.  Well it's no way you could tell.
Speaker 1: Did they, did the children go to white schools in Chattanooga?
Speaker 2: No.  No, they went to black school, they went to black school.  But then after Louis [Louis Woodall], who's living now in Chicago [Illinois], and he's married to an African American woman, all his driver's license, everything is white, he passes for white all the time.
Speaker 1: Now what did you learn?  In Chattanooga, was there a particular subject where you excelled?
Speaker 2: No.  I, at junior high school, they had a teacher there, his name was Mr. Jenkins [James L. Jenkins], and he taught what you call manual training.  They had came out with the NRA [National Recovery Administration] and the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] and the--I think it was the NRA, no not NRA, some alphabet where you could, after class, you could clean up the school and you could make, I think, fifteen cents, and that's what I did.  I worked, you know, doing that, but I used to get up--then I got a job throwing the paper, the Chattanooga Free Press [Chattanooga Times Free Press].  I would get up in the morning, at three o'clock every morning, and I would throw the paper out on East 9th Street, what is now Martin Luther King Boulevard, and then when I'd throw the papers, I got a job down at F.W. Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company], they had a closet like out on the street and I had a key to it, it had a bucket and thing and I would wash the outside of the windows and then I'd go to school, you know?
Story_ID: 531539
Speaker 1: But when I went over to Howard High [Howard High School; The Howard School], when I graduated--
Speaker 2: So this was in Chattanooga [Tennessee] or Lithonia [Georgia]--
Speaker 1: --in Chattanooga, in Chattanooga.  I, I graduated from East Fifth Street Junior High [East Fifth Street Junior High School, Chattanooga, Tennessee], and I went to Howard that September and they told me, they said, "We're gonna put you in manual training."  So they had a shed like, with automobiles and they said, "We're gonna teach you how to work on cars," so they had me washing the cars, things like that and so, I saw this sign that said, if Uncle Sam says, we want you down at the post office, and what, and I saw this black guy in a uniform, [U.S.] Navy uniform, and I was talking to him, he said, go in the recruiting office, he said, "You go down in the basement in the post office there and enlist."  And I went down and enlisted in the Navy, and--
Speaker 2: Wow, this is around 1940 or so?
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-one [1941].
Speaker 2: So you enlisted in the Navy even before that happens, you're in high school in Chattanooga, Tennessee?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: In the late '30s [1930s], early '40s [1940s], what is the, what is the climate like racially in Chattanooga when you're in high school?  Did you notice anything?  Were there any KKK [Ku Klux Klan] events there?
Speaker 1: No.  But, they had City High School [Chattanooga High School, Chattanooga, Tennessee], where East Fifth Street was, well, on 3rd Street, which is only a couple of blocks over, were city schools, like a ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], and I could see those white boys, you know, with their uniform on and things, drilling and marching like and what.  And, I wanted to get into something like that, and I would get the trolley car going on East 3rd Street where we lived and you'd have to sit in the back, you know, of the trolley car in Chattanooga, or what.  And when I graduated from junior high, and went to Howard, well I was eighteen then and in the tenth grade, and they put me in manual training or what, they said I couldn't handle it academically, you know or what, and that's when I decided to join the Navy.  And I joined the Navy in October, of my, I graduated that summer, and went to Howard that September and that Sep- that first month was enough, you know, they wouldn't let me be in class, you know, sent me over to this thing where, you know, teach you how to work on cars and what.  So, they say, you know, they had, A Model Ford [Ford Model A], and you know, the T Models [Ford Model T] and things.
Speaker 2: This is around what year?
Speaker 1: This was in, '41 [1941], '41 [1941], I was eighteen, yeah.
Speaker 2: Before you joined?
Speaker 1: Yeah, before I joined.  When I joined I was eighteen.
Speaker 2: And so in high school though.  So you weren't--what were you learning in high school?
Speaker 1: Well, I went to high school a month.
Speaker 2: I see.

Story_ID: 531540
Speaker 1: Were you going back and forth between Chattanooga [Tennessee] and Lithonia, Georgia (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no.  I went to Chattanooga first when I went to elementary school, Main Street [West Main Street School, Chattanooga, Tennessee], then I went back to Lithonia and went up to Panola Road, Ms. Rainwater there, and then I went back to Chattanooga.
Speaker 1: If--that you were seeing your family?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Holidays and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --things like that?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were holidays like?
Speaker 2: Oh, holidays is, they would, I rem- the thing I remember most was Union Baptist Church [Union Missionary Baptist Church, Lithonia, Georgia].  They would have like a family day, we used to call it a spreading, they would bring their benches out and put the benches together, you know, seats together on the benches and people would bring their, their market baskets full of chicken, possum and rabbit and everything and pies and everything and just put it all on the benches and everybody'd just eat, you know.  And they would have some of everything to eat, you know?
Speaker 1: Was Union Baptist Church in Lithonia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Union Baptist Church in Lithonia, Reverend Walker [N.T. Walker].  I remember him well.
Speaker 1: So you were--in Lithonia, you were not too far from Atlanta [Georgia], and Atlanta, at this time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighteen miles.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it was an experience in sort of a renaissance?
Speaker 2: Well, the experience was--I remember Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], my father [Harvie Phillips] telling me that Dr. King's mother's father [Adam Daniel Williams] used to be a pastor in Lithonia, at a young Baptist church, you know?  And, well when I got a chance to meet Dr. King in Boston [Massachusetts], when he was going to school at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], getting his doctorate, he preached at Reverend Michael Haynes' church [Twelfth Baptist Church] on Warren Street in Boston.  And I happened to go to church that Sunday, I didn't know anything at all about Dr. King, but he really impressed me with his sermon and I got, as the pastor always do, come out and shake hands, you know, at the entrance way as you leave, leave the church, I shook his hand.
Speaker 1: Wow!  So we're going to have to talk about, that happened in the '60s [1960s] right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was still in the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: Wow!  So it--
Speaker 2: I would--
Speaker 1: --like you--
Speaker 2: --never, no--
Speaker 1: --have quite a story--
Speaker 2: --this was--
Speaker 1: --to tell--
Speaker 2: --in the '50s [1950s]--
Speaker 1: --but--
Speaker 2: --this was in the '50s [1950s]--
Speaker 1: --in the '50s [1950s]--
Speaker 2: --in the '50s [1950s], 'cause I'm still in the Navy and--
Speaker 1: --so let's get, let's, let's bring you up to that, right?  'Cause we've got to get through high school graduation and college.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right?  And then I'm gonna get you to the Navy too.  You were going back and forth to Lithonia, and you went to Union Baptist Church?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, was there a strong sense of pride at the, at the church?
Speaker 2: Oh yes--
Speaker 1: It felt by the parents and the grandparents?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh yes.  Well, it, it was, everybody in the church was, the church was it.  The preacher, Reverend Walker, would come down on a Saturday and spend the night with some of their parishioners, you know, or what, because he's gonna preach that Sunday, and long before I went to Chattanooga, I know everybody would take him eggs or take him a bunch of collard greens, a bag of sweet potatoes and what.  I guess that's all, mostly he got paid, or what and he'd have a load of stuff to take back, I think he was from Atlanta, I'm not sure, Atlanta or Decatur [Georgia].  And so was the one at Antioch [Antioch Lithonia Baptist Church, Lithonia, Georgia], there're two church--we only had three churches, so--
Speaker 1: One you said, Dr. King's--
Speaker 2: Mother's father preached (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Preached there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: That was--
Speaker 1: --so that was?
Speaker 2: Antioch--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh?
Speaker 2: --Antioch Church.
Speaker 1: Did you hear any stories about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I didn't--
Speaker 1: --the sermons?
Speaker 2: --hear it, my father just told me about, you know, that.  And that's all I knew about that part of it.
Story_ID: 531541
Speaker 1: Were you hearing about what was happening in Warm Springs, Georgia at the time with FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], his visits down there?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew about President Roosevelt, in the '30s [1930s], because people were saying he was gonna help the black people, you know and things like that because people was working for five cents an hour, I remember that, you know, five cents an hour, ten cents an hour, or what.  And then, they would work, say all the week and they would (unclear) in that.  I remember John Pope [ph.], he was in the [U.S.] Army, black African American in the Army, and he went to France, they say he got gassed in France and then came back and he got a bonus I think in the '30s [1930s] there, and he put the money in the bank, I think it was seven hundred dollars, and he put it in the bank and he went up and drew five dollars out and he went back to get fi- another five dollars a week later or what, and they told him, "If you come back again, we're gonna throw you in jail," and they kicked him and beat him up and took his money, you know.  I.M. Starr, the same guy that got his ear bit off by Charlie Mitchell [Charles Mitchell], see, but they lynched Charlie Mitchell, killed him, and or what, and.  But, the thing, when I joined the [U.S.] Navy in October '41 [1941], I graduated in that summer and I worked that summer at a Milner Hotel on Broad Street in Atlanta [Georgia].  I would throw papers in the morning and I'd go down to Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] and wash the windows and the, when school was in session, I'd get out of school and go down and wash dishes and what happened, I was supposed to get paid on a Thursday, and I think I had two dollars coming and I had put a pair of pants, people were wearing zoot suits, real small down around their ankles but the knees and that part was out, or what.  And I it put, had it on layaway for quite a few weeks and I wanted to get paid and waited and waited and waited, I could see the lady out there who's the boss, who owned it, I guess, and she was talking to two guys and so, about twelve o'clock I went out and asked her and said, "Can I get paid?"  You know?  And she cursed me out and told me don't ever show up there again, or what, and said, "Now get out of here, now."  So, I left and some fellow there said, "Come back tomorrow and get your money."  So I went back and he said, "Don't ever go up to a white woman and say nothing, especially if she's talking to a white man," you interfere, or what, and, that helped me join the Na- decide to join the Navy too.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: You know?  And, because well, I wanted to get away from that, you know?  And I thought if I joined the Navy and go places, that was one way of getting up north for one thing, and I went to boot camp, went to boot camp.
Speaker 1: Had you seen--had you been inspired?  You mentioned the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] in Chattanooga [Tennessee], were there other moments of inspiration in Atlanta, Lithonia [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Chattanooga?
Speaker 2: The ROTC, City High School [Chattanooga High School, Chattanooga, Tennessee] was white, and then they had another one, McCallie [McCallie School, Chattanooga, Tennessee], out on McCallie Avenue, they were military schools like, but they were all white and I--they had uniforms on and that I'd, you know, it just, I just said, gee, I wished I could, you know, wear a uniform like that and what.  And I remember at fourteen, I tried to join their CCC camp, their Civilian Conservation Corps, and they wouldn't let, said I was too young, said I had to be sixteen and I couldn't do that.  And, when I joined the Navy, they sent me to Norfolk, Virginia and that, that was the thing, from there I went to Boston [Massachusetts], went aboard the Truxtun [USS Truxtun (DD-229)].
Story_ID: 531542
Speaker 1: If we had to go on a journey through time from Lithonia [Georgia], to Chattanooga [Tennessee], to Atlanta [Georgia] and then you end up in the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite sights and smells and sounds of that sojourn from Lithonia to Chattanooga to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember I had, as a child, or what, before I went to Chattanooga, I knew about baseball, but I had never heard of basketball or football, I'd never heard of any of that.  But when I got to Chattanooga, I learned about basketball and football, and I was really, really wanted to get involved in that.  So, when I went to Fifth Street Junior High School [East Fifth Street Junior High School, Chattanooga, Tennessee], I played basketball, and I think I was pretty good at it or what, and I wanted to go to high school, you know, but I graduated that June and I went over to Howard [Howard High School; The Howard School, Chattanooga, Tennessee] that September and they put in that manual training, you know, no academics and everything so, I decided to join the Navy.
Speaker 1: Because you wanted to learn?  You were hungry to learn?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  And, I, I only had a month of high school, if you wanna call it that, you know.  And that's when I joined the Navy in October.
Speaker 1: Who decided that you would only get manual labor training?
Speaker 2: Well, some of the teachers.  I had problems, I didn't think I was, I was worried to death they wasn't going to graduate me from junior high because I had problems with Latin, I was studying Latin and I had a problem, you know, with the words and things, and I tried to memorize the whole book and even today, I can quote many Latin words and things, you know, that was there and I remember I used to write it down in my hand, you know, and things, and the teacher see it, she said, "Well you're cheating, say what's in your hand?"  I'd look down, you know?  They said, "Well how do you say algiculture [ph.]," I'd say aldificium [ph.], you know, I'd look in my hand, you know?  And say, "What does it mean, or what--?"  That's the way they did it, you know?  They'd say how about say, poveta [ph.], or portable, you know, or what?  And how about the viaduct, you know, you know, how about, vidant, you know, video, you know, say, all Vs sounded like W, there is no W, so all Vs sound like W or what.
Speaker 1: So you were getting a standard education learning Latin?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in junior high.
Speaker 1: In junior high, that was pretty early.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And your parents meanwhile, were they working in the quarry and on the farm?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Georgia, yes.
Speaker 1: And whose quarry was this?
Speaker 2: Well, my [maternal] grandfather, Ed Woodall, had a quarry but, my father [Harvie Phillips] and grandfather and what, worked at Davidson quarry, there was a big quarry, but my grandfather, some of his children worked on the quarry, he had a small quarry, like, small quarry.  And what they did was beat rubble, they called it, you know?  That's take the big stones and make little blocks out of 'em and what, you know?
Speaker 1: That's hard work.
Speaker 2: Hard work, you know.  And before their monkey came out, that was the air hammer, like, they did by hand and they'd drill, when I used to turn the thing, what they do is sharpen their drills, you'd put the coals on there and you'd turn to keep the air coming and then they'd turn it up and sharpen it.  And then they would, to drill a hole in it, in there they would beat the thing and they'd turn it as they beat it or what and, then they'd put the tool, half rounds in a wedge in there and they could split that rock a straight line right down, they was good at it you know.
Speaker 1: But you knew this was not the life you wanted to live?
Speaker 2: That was not the life I wanted, I knew that.
Story_ID: 531543
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So then you went on to the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that pretty rare for an African American child?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  I joined the Navy and I was so proud, you know?  I went to Norfolk, Virginia, and, but I was a little shocked when I got to Virginia, you know?  They had this boot camp, but today I know it wasn't a boot camp, it was a mess attendant school, and what they did was, gave you a uniform and all and gave you a wooden rifle, and not a real rifle and teach you how to drill you know, how to march a little bit.  But they had a building set up, and had it set up like an officers' ward room, and they taught you how to put the proper silverware in the proper place and how to serve on one side and take up the plate on the other side and things like that, and after four weeks, they ship you out to sea.
Speaker 1: So they knew immediately if you're black and in the Navy, you're going to work in the mess hall?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.  No, no exceptions, no exceptions at all.  That's where you went, and that's where--what you did.  And when you went aboard ship it was no difference, you were separate altogether, on the small ships, you would have a section down in the corner and they'd put a piece of canvas across to separate you from the whites, and what.  But, you weren't allowed to eat in the mess hall with the rest of the crew, your little pantry where you served the officers, that's where you ate and you, you couldn't sit because there was no room to sit, you had to si- go out on deck and sit on the deck in the passage way or you stand to eat, well you ate the same food the officers ate because you were on were on pro tem, see and the officers got paid, but you didn't, because they had private mess.  And once you made third class, if you made third class cook and what, you'd change uniforms, like the chiefs or the officers, but you had to get rid of all the brass buttons, and put black buttons on and put a bow tie and you had a cap like the chiefs, but you couldn't put an anchor on there, just put USN across there and that's the way it was.
Speaker 1: How did that feel?  Did that feel unfair?
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't feel so much unfair because I was used to worse than that, and, it was lesser of the two evils, you know, in Georgia.  And, my first trip was to Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland, and when we got to Iceland, the captain [Ralph Hickox] came on that PA system, said, "Liberty commence at 1600, but no Negroes are allowed in Iceland."  And he said, they called us Negroes back then, he said, "No Negroes are allowed," said, "but it's not me, so you can't go ashore, it's the United States made an agreement with Iceland that if they let them have, let the U.S. have a refueling base there, they would never let a Negro put foot on Icelandic soil."  He said, "But don't feel bad, because we had to do the same thing at Port Lyautey, Morocco [Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco]."  He said, "No Jew is allowed, we can't let a Jew go ashore in Morocco," so we couldn't go ashore, so that was you know, kind of down, came back to the states.  And our next trip we was going to Argentia, Newfoundland [Naval Station Argentia, Canada], and that was it.
Story_ID: 531544
Speaker 1: So we're talking about your first year in the [U.S.] Navy--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What were some of your first sights and sounds of the Navy when you got there, your favorite sort of, memorable moments?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to boot camp and after three weeks they let us go ashore, and I went ashore in Norfolk, Virginia, and I remember the club we went to called the Citizens Club and, on Bainbridge Street [Bainbridge Avenue] I think it was, no Church Street, on Church Street in Norfolk, Virginia, the Citizen Club and the trolley car going from north down Hampton Roads [Hampton Roads Beltway] back to the base.  It would be so crowded until some of the fellows would pull the string in the back, all the blacks had to be in the back of the trolley car and the conductor was white and if he see a bunch of black sailors we wouldn't stop so some of us would pull that string in the back, that rope that where the wheel on the wire up there and it'd stop and he'd have to get out and come and then the guys would get on.  So then, I have known cases where somebody would just take the controls and take off, you know, leave him.  But when we got they'd stop it just before we got to the gate because the police would be there, he'd call or something and they'd stop and everybody'd jump off you know, and they wouldn't know who did it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Or what.
Speaker 1: Well now, you were, you were segregated though in the Navy?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have interaction at all with the white men?
Speaker 2: No.  No, none.
Speaker 1: Just the officers?
Speaker 2: Just the officers, just the officer.  After boot camp, just the officers, you would shine the officers' shoes, make the beds, clean the rooms, cook the food, serve them.  Well, you ate the same food, well because you weren't allowed to eat in the mess hall with the white sailors.
Story_ID: 531545
Speaker 1: At what point in that first year did you finally get to get aboard the ship and go out to sea?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to, I got orders after boot camp to go to Boston [Massachusetts], Charlestown Navy Yard [Boston Navy Yard], Frazier Barracks was the receiving station and it was filled, so they put me onboard Old Ironsides, the [USS] Constitution that fought in the Revolution [American Revolutionary War], you know, or what.  So I stayed there for five days until the Truxtun [USS Truxtun (DD-229)] came in, I was waiting for the Truxtun, and it came in and I went aboard, you know and--
Speaker 1: What was your first reaction?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was glad to get off the Constitution, you know?  Because, you know, the old ship, what?  Hundreds of years old, and when I went aboard, and then I saw where my assignment was, to sleep or what, I was a little disgusted with that, back in the corner, they had four blacks and one Filipino, and I was the junior mess boy they called 'em.  So, the five bunks, I was on the top bunk, the junior man, the senior was on the bottom and as the seniority go, you go to the top, I, I was the junior so I was at the top, just enough room to turn over without hitting the overhead, or what.  And when the Truxtun ran aground, when it hit I was thrown out of my bunk on top of all the rest of 'em down there, you know?  Everybody slept with their clothes on because we had already lost there, even before December 7th, as history teaches people that the war [World War II, WWII] started December the 7th, '41 [1941].  Well, we were fighting in the Atlantic [Atlantic Ocean] before that because we had lost the Reuben James [USS Reuben James (DD-245)] and then Jacob Jones [USS Jacob Jones (DD-130)], the Germans had torpedoed those two destroyers and hit the Kearny [USS Kearny (DD-432)], but she made it on into Iceland.  Well anyway, I, aft-
Speaker 1: Well what (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After Iceland, we came back to the states.
Speaker 1: Well even before you get there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --'cause you were telling us a little bit about, about Iceland, right?  That they weren't allowing blacks to get off, how did that make you feel?
Speaker 2: Oh, well it made me feel like I was back in Georgia, or what, you know?  And that was it, you know?  And I was hoping we'd get back to Boston, you know?
Story_ID: 531546
Speaker 1: We hit a storm going back to Boston [Massachusetts] and when we got back there, they put on some new depth charge guns, the Y-guns, K-guns and L-guns, and they did some repair because some damage was done on the ship [USS Truxtun (DD-229)] coming back, and we were supposed to get underway, and they hadn't finished repairing the repairs so we was late getting underway, we didn't get underway, until that Sunday and we're supposed to meet up with the Wilkes [USS Wilkes (DD-441)] and the Pollux [USS Pollux (AKS-2)], another destroyer.  The Wilkes, Pollux supply ship, but we didn't catch up until around Halifax, Nova Scotia [Canada], and we did and this storm was beginning to get worse, worse, worse, and that Wednesday, on February the 18th, we ran aground, you know?  Hit the rocks and the, the waves was about eighty feet high and it would just pick the ship up and slam it against the rocks because when we were first hit, they tried to back down, and that tore the two screws off, the two propellers off, and we were dead in the water and the waves would just pick it up and slam it against the rocks and--
Speaker 2: Is this the--what time of day is this?
Speaker 1: Oh, it was in the morning about 3:30 in the morning, still dark.
Speaker 2: And this was, 1941?
Speaker 1: Forty-two [1942], February 18th, 1942.  And then when I was thrown, when it hit, everybody slept with their clothes on, because we knew that the German wolf packs, you know was out there, you know?  And what they were doing was trying to keep close to shore or what, they, you know, from the wolf packs, and everybody slept ready roll, they called it, with your clothes on, you just pull your shoes off, use your life jacket as a pillow because you'd expect to be, you know, be torpedoed and when it hit, I thought we'd been torpedoed and I'd come out on top of the other mess attendants there and I just grabbed a pair of shoes and ran topside.  And it was dark, and eventually they turned the big carbon search light on and all I could see was ice and snow, you know, I thought we was in Iceland 'cause it looked just like Iceland did, you know?  Nothing but ice and snow as far as you could see, and there're high cliffs, or what, and the other mess attendants came out, or what and--
Speaker 2: How many mess attendants were there, black?
Speaker 1: Four of us.  Myself, three others and one Filipino [Tomas Dayo] too, it's five a total of five, four black and one Filipino, and, there was Langston, Henry Langston, he was from Virginia, Houston [Earl Houston], was from New York, Turner [Billy Gene Turner] was from Pine Bluff, Arkansas and the Filipino was from the Philippines, or what, and they all died, they all died, you know, because they was afraid to go ashore.  But, we lost the gig and the whale boat, the storm had torn, we carried eight rafts, the storm had torn off, and we lost six of the rafts, only had two rafts and once Egner [Harry Egner] got ashore and got a line over and its second raft, I told him, I said, you know, let's go, because ice was forming on all our bodies and everything and every time a wave would come, it washed fifteen or twenty people, the ship had broke in half, and the after part had drift off and sunk, and everybody was up on the bow part and we were standing there, the other three blacks, and I told 'em, I said we're gonna die, they said, "Well that's Iceland, they'll probably lynch us if we go ashore."  I said, "Well at least we can die fighting," I said, "let's go."  And no, they said no, said "Help is gonna come," said, "the [U.S.] Navy is gonna get help in here for us and what."  Well they had a plane circling overhead, they didn't have helicopters back then, well the plane was circling overhead, and say, the plane's up there, so they're gonna, they know we're here, they're gonna get help and what.  So over the side I went, I went over the side, they got on the raft and--
Speaker 2: So you were on a raft with--
Speaker 1: --yeah, it got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) with white men because the other--
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: --people of color stayed--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it--
Speaker 2: --aboard--
Speaker 1: --was, it was--
Speaker 2: --the ship?
Speaker 1: --about four white guys on this raft.

Speaker 1: I jumped in the water, and they pulled me on board, helped me get onboard the raft, because see, the type rafts they had then were K-pots [ph.], you know?  So, I got on and I was sitting around the edges there and we finally made it ashore, we were only about 250, maybe three hundred yards from shore, and we could see like a fence on top of the cliff, so we knew, you know, for that fence to be there, we figured it was for to keep the sheep and goat or something, you know, from falling over the edge there.  And the raft capsized just before we landed, or what, and then, well Bergeron [Edward Bergeron] had gone in the first raft, he and Egner [Harry Egner], and climbed the cliff, he had a knife, because they, they, they always told us to carry condoms, and the purpose for the condoms was to put a box of matches in there a knife, and what, and then tie a knot in it, it becomes waterproof.  And, so if the ship is sunk you would have a match, you know or something you could start a fire, and that's what they had, and Bergeron used his knife to put etches in the ice and climb the cliff.  And he climbed the cliff and made it over the ice cap, he saw light about three miles and notified the people of St. Lawrence [Canada], the ship [USS Truxtun (DD-229)] and they all, they closed the mine [Iron Springs Mine], shut down their little village, the store, they had one store or what, and they came, they came down on ropes, down the cliffs.  Well when I got ashore, I thought I was in Iceland, well, it was a strange, strange feeling, I, it's hard to explain because it seemed like I was conscious but it seems like time, say if I wanted to walk from here to the window, it would take hours, it seemed like.  And I, seemed like my heart, instead of beating boop, boop, boop, it would beat, boomp--boomp--and I was wondering if that next beat was coming, and I knew all I had to do was close my eyes and die, because the, the Cato brothers [James Cato and Leo Cato] had sat on the torpedo tube and put their arms around each other, said, goodbye, this is it and just died, you know?  So I knew all I had to do was close my eyes and die.  So I went back in the cove there, a little small cove, not much bigger than this room, went back in the corner and decided to die, I decided to die, you know, so I got down on the ground there and somebody, well the Newfoundlander had scaled the cliff and come down and one picked me up, when he picked me up, I looked up, I knew it wasn't a sailor and I knew it wasn't an American, he said, "Don't lie there, you'll surely die," he said, "get up."  And he told another Newfoundlander, said, "Walk him around," and I looked at his white face and what, you know, I said, here's a white man that wants to help me, you know?  I'm thinking, I said nothing, you know, I could barely move and it just, they began to walk me around, and Egner had started a fire, some of the crates had washed ashore and what, and I began to walk around and I, they said, "Well, the tide is coming in," and, said, "do whatever you want, try to make it up the cliff."  So Bergeron had gone up the cliff, so Egner and I went around and went up, it's like a rejuvenation or what, when that fellow picked me up, you know, and everything, began to walk me around to help me, I'd never heard a kind word from a white man in my life, you know?
Story_ID: 531548
Speaker 1: Once we got at the top of the cliff or what, I remember seeing this Newfoundland pony, I'd never seen a pony, I've seen plenty of horses and mules and things, but this a little short with extremely long hair, you know, on it, and I just didn't know what to think.  And I remember getting on the slate, and I must've passed out because when I gained conscious again, I was, woke up stark naked on this table at the Iron Springs Mine [St. Lawrence, Canada].  Now when the ship [USS Truxtun (DD-229)] broke in half, the bunker sea oil hit that water, it gelled, like jelly, so everybody was black, completely covered, and they said that's why forty-six survived out of 156, is because it formed an insulation of our bodies.  So, when I gained consciousness, they were massaging my body, you know, I was naked and all that, eyes was kind of glued together like, you know, from the bunker sea oil and I opened my eyes and I saw all these white ladies, you know, and I looked at myself, I'm naked and the fear just came over me, you know, I was thinking about Georgia, and I figured, I said, well I know they're gonna lynch me, you know.  And, I heard one of the ladies say, "This is the curliest hair I've ever seen," I had a big head of hair, you know, 'cause I didn't have barbers on the ship and they said, "Let's clean him up," and they began to bathe me and one of the ladies had my hand, she said, "It's all in his pores, you know?"  Or what, and that's the first time I spoke up, I said, "That's the color of the skin," she just had my hand, you know, and was rubbing and then they, she said, I said, "it's the color of the skin, you know?"  And they said, "Oh we'll take care of it, we'll get it off," you know, or what.  And then she said, after they bathe me or what, they held my head up and began to give me rum or something in a teaspoon, and then they bathed me with warm soap and water or what, and Mrs. Pike [Violet Pike] said, I'll take him to my home and women were saying, I'll take two, I'll take three, you know or what.  And they gave me a pair of long johns, put on and put a blanket around me and took me to her home, she said this is where you're gonna sleep and put me in the bed and I could look through the room there was a curtain like, a cloth curtain, I could see this big potbellied stove like and she was heating the rocks and wrapping 'em in a cloth or something and bring it back and put it in the bed and say, "You're warm?"  And I'd say yes, and she said, "I made some soup for you," and came and lifted my head up and was holding me like an infant and was feeding me, you know, the soup.  And I thought about Georgia, and I could just see the Ku Klux Klan [KKK], you know, imaginarily, and it just did something to me, the love and humanity that these, this lady bestowed upon me, you know?  Still thinking I'm in Iceland, you know?  I said, well they lied to me, you know?  Because these people, I never saw a white person so kind and so nice, you know, say such nice things, you know.  Oil was running out of my ears and everything and I said, "Gee it's all on your pillow," you know, she said, "Don't worry about it," you know, she said, "come on take some more soup," you know, with a spoon.  And, next morning, well I didn't sleep all that night, it was late at night by this time and she said, "Here's some clothes," said, "put these on," she went out and I put the clothes on and I wanted to go outside, still thinking it's Iceland.  So the [U.S.] Navy, the George E. Badger [USS George E. Badger (DD-196)], that was the name of the ship had came in, and I went outside to look around, I wanted to look around and see, you know?  And this petty officer came up, said, hey, well I had on this overalls and these boots up to my knees, you know, and, and what clothes on that she had given me, her husband's clothing.  And he said, "Come with me," he said, "we're from the Navy," he said, "are you one of the survivors off the ship?"  I said, "Yes."  I said, "Let me go back inside and thank Mrs. Pike," you know, I didn't know her name, I just knew the lady, you know, I wanted to go inside and thank her, I was happy the Navy was there.  He said, grabbed me by the arm, he said no, said, "You heard what I said."  She was looking, so she ran out and she came out and said, "What's going on?  What are you doing?"  He said, "I'm taking him down to the ship," said, "he's got to go to the ship," say, "You have to hold him like that?"  She said, "Why do that?"  And she, it was only maybe as much as a, might have been a block, maybe a half block, went down to the ship and she walked down with us and went aboard and went to Argentia [Canada] where the base [Naval Station Argentia] was.
Story_ID: 531549
Speaker 1: We got in at, late that evening, and had two buses to pick up the survivors and everybody was, had on civilian clothes you might say, the clothing that the people had given us.  Well the Pollux [USS Pollux (AKS-2)] had sunk about ten miles from us, and those survivors were there too, so I was in line, when I got up there, he said, "No, not you," I said, "I'm off the Truxtun [USS Truxtun (DD-229)]," you know, I figure he didn't know I was, you know, of the American sailor.  He said, "I don't give a damn what you're off of, you're not getting on this bus."  I said, "What am I to do?"  I said, "I'm off the Truxtun," he said, "you're going on the Prairie [USS Prairie (AD-15)]."  Well I knew then that they must have known a African American had survived, say, the word had made it in or what, and they'd made arrangements for me to go on this ship, so they told the messenger to take him on the shipboard, it's real close on the, maybe a quarter of a block, real close like from this building over to that other building there.  So they put me on board the Prairie, and five days I stayed there down with the other mess attendants on the ship, so they gave me some clothing or what, I never saw a doctor or anything, and they buried--a lot of bodies floated ashore, and they buried them there, but they never notified me or anything, I never went there.  And they put me on an oil tanker, the Salamonie [USS Salamonie (AO-26)], and came back to the states.  So, we got into Catskill Bay [ph.], Maine and the destroyer tender, [USS] Denebola, they put me on the Denebola, they gave me a uniform, a meal ticket and a train ticket to go to Boston [Massachusetts] from Portland, Maine, and I caught the train, went to Boston, Frazier Barracks in Charlestown [Boston Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts], and they said, "We're gonna give you leave," or what, said, we'll give you thirty days or what, and report back here.  Well I didn't have any money, so I said, "Well, I don't have money," they said, "Well, you can borrow it from the Red Cross [American Red Cross]," so the Red Cross loaned me thirty dollars and I agreed to pay it back five dollars a month for six months.  The pay at that time was twenty-one dollars a month, that's what I got, twenty-one dollars a month was my pay and I did and I caught the train, and went out to the end of the line, Forest Hills [Forest Hills Station, Boston, Massachusetts], and I hitchhiked to Washington, D.C. and I caught the bus to Chattanooga [Tennessee] or what, so that was about it.
Speaker 2: And that's how you spent your thirty days?
Speaker 1: Ma- well, yes, my thirty days, and I went to Lithonia [Georgia] for two days and went back to Chattanooga, and then I went back.  And they assigned me, well, I went to the Fargo building [Fargo Barracks, Boston, Massachusetts], 495 Summit Street [sic. Summit Avenue], used to be The Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company] plant, the [U.S.] Navy had taken it over as a receiving station.  But, when I went back they gave me orders to report to Pier 92 [Manhattan Cruise Terminal] in New York [New York], and I caught the battleship New York [USS New York (BB-34)], made the North African invasion, come back and they sent me to school, cooks and steward school in San Diego [California].
Story_ID: 531550
Speaker 1: How did you digest this accident though, first, in Newfoundland [Canada]?  How did you make sense of what had happened to you and the tragedy of losing some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --some of--
Speaker 2: --it was--
Speaker 1: --your colleagues?
Speaker 2: --it was hard, and I had a few problems at the Fargo building [Fargo Barracks, Boston, Massachusetts] there.  Again, they separated me from the other white survivors and I went aboard the battleship New York [USS New York (BB-34)], and went to--after the North African invasion, and--something happens there.  We went to (unclear), about 150 miles north of Casablanca [Morocco] and the Texas [USS Texas (BB-35)], our sister battleship, was down at Casablanca, the French, Jean Bart battleship was tied up against the pier at Casablanca, and she would fire, she hit the Texas, and Texas went out and they ordered the New York to come down, went down and they let us go ashore one day.  And I met Josephine Baker, out of St. Louis [Missouri], she was an American entertainer, a singer or something and she was there with the free French, you know, or what, that's where they had left France when the Germans occupied it or what and they were there.  Well anyway, when I went to school in--
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about Josephine Baker?  This is a big moment right?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She's a--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --famous singer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she--
Speaker 1: What was she like?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, she--we went ashore, well other blacks were on board the New York, must have been about twenty of us, you know, but all of us didn't go ashore, they let about half of us go ashore one day and half the next, but we had to be back at five o'clock in the afternoon.  You couldn't be there at night, you know, just taken over.  She talked and everything, told me she's from St. Louis, Missouri, or what, I had never heard of Josephine Baker, you know, being from the rural South or what, and everything.  So she talked to me and what and I talked to her or what.
Speaker 1: Did you share stories about race relations compared to the U.S. and is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we didn't have time, didn't have time for that, we were going about the city or what looking and things like that.
Speaker 1: Now when was this?
Speaker 2: This was in, I went aboard September '42 [1942], this was November, '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: So a lot happened to you in that one year period?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Well the entire naval career had happened to me.  Well when I graduated from cooks and steward school, I got orders, report to Port Hueneme in California, Oxnard [California], about sixty miles out of Los Angeles [California] for Acorn training, and I went down, they said, put all your clothing in this box, or when they issued me uniforms like the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] fatigues or what, then anyway, I finished training then I was in an Acorn, and the Acorn and Casu, C-A-S-U, Carrier Aircraft Service Unit.  When the Marines would land on the islands, the Seabees [U.S. Naval Construction Battalions] would go in with them or the very next wave and we'd be waiting on the ship, and as soon as the Seabees get ashore and mow down enough of the jungle, to lay the mats down, and set up a landing strip for the planes, we'd go ashore.  The Acorn aircraft construction ordinance readied your navigation, but my job was the same, mess attendant, they had tents for the officers and what, we'd take care of their tents and things, but we all had rifles and things, and was trained to fight the Japanese, you know?  Or what, but we would be behind the lines, more or less.  Well anyway, our first island was Espiritu Santo [Vanuatu], in the New Hebrides, from there we went to Mbanika [Solomon Islands], in the Russell Islands, from there we went to Manus [Manus Island] in the Admiralties [Admiralty Islands], from there we went down through New Guinea, Port Moresby [Papua New Guinea], on into the Philippines, Leyte and Samar, and on my way back to the states, the war [World War II, WWII] ended.  I got orders to go to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida.
Story_ID: 531551
Speaker 1: Now, all this time when you're at sea, and you're active duty during World War II [WWII], did you see any of the, the combat?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  Bougainville [Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea], I was on Bougainville, and the Japs [Japanese] almost took it back or what, pushed us, we--it had two strips, Piva [Piva Airfield], north up near the volcano [Mt. Bagana], it had an active volcano on Bougainville and then down near the beach was Torokina [Torokina Airfield], where the fighter planes would land or what.  They pushed us just about back down, they would shell every night, they would be shelling us from the hill and the Japanese Navy [Imperial Japanese Navy; Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force] would be shelling us from the sea, planes would come over and drop a bomb or two, you know?  Where we used to call 'em washboard Charlie, you know, they'd come up--you know.
Speaker 1: Were you?  So you were still working in the mess hall, were you envious of your white colleagues who were involved in more, the more technical aspects?
Speaker 2: Oh no.  We, we ha- when they sound general quarters, we went to battle stations, we went to battle stations, we manned guns, now on the battleship New York [USS New York (BB-34)], on the Truxtun [USS Truxtun (DD-229)], I was on a three inch gun up on the fore side, and you could be washing dishes, or what, but when (unclear) sounds, you went to, to your battle station.  See, that's why I look at documentaries and things on Dorie Miller [Doris Miller], whom I knew, you know in '43 [1943], he and I went out and had drinks and everything together in San Diego [California].  Now his battle station was on the twenty millimeter on the West Virginia [USS West Virginia (BB-48)] when he shot down those planes over Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii], but I see some magazines or what, say he wasn't trained in how, in ordinance.  And, well that's baloney, see, because we did have battle stations, even though you cooked and shined shoes and things, but when general quarters si- on the New York, during the North African invasion, I was in the fourteen inch magazine sending the powder up to the fourteen inch guns or what.  And all the rest of the ships, even in Korea, like we went up the Taedong River, thirty-seven miles and burned the whole town of Taedong down, Taedong River (unclear), when the [U.S.] Army and Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] had left all their equipment, we were given the orders to do it, and we fired eight thousand rounds of white phosphorus, and that's what we did, and all the mess attendants fought.
Story_ID: 531552
Speaker 1: So this entire time you were out at sea fighting during World War II [WWII], was there fear?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really because you knew it was either you or them, one or the other, now I was on the Half Moon [USS Half Moon (AVP-26)], a seaplane tender, and we got caught between the American forces and the Japanese, the Second Battle of the Philippine Sea [Battle of Leyte Gulf] after I left the Acorn, they put me on board the Half Moon, AVP-29 [sic.] or what, and we could see the projectiles just going over us, we went as close as we could get into the beach.  We knew we had carried, what, I think five hundred thousand gallons of octane aviation fuel, you know, we knew if we'd hit, and we did almost get hit.  A kamikaze hit an LST [Landing Ship Tank] and then some of the shrapnel hit our ship and killed three or four guys, you know, on our ship, you know?  I don't know if they was trying to hit us or not, but you didn't, you didn't have fear, you know, you don't get fear until after it's all over, after it's all over.  But my thing about the war, when they gave me orders to go to Jacksonville, Florida, and when I got to Jacksonville--
Speaker 1: In 1940--
Speaker 2: This was in '45 [1945], 1945, the war had just ended.  When I got to Jacksonville, I put my sea bag down and I--I loved being from the South, raised in the South, I knew it should be two signs, white and colored, we called it the waiting room, that's what we called it where you wait for the train and I saw this soldier with his rifle, and they had a roped off area, and I went up, I said, "Where is the colored waiting room?"  He said, "I don't know," he said, "we have a prison train, so we have German and Italian prisoners here, and we're feeding them in there."  Said, "The restaurant is closed off to civilians," said, "we got the Germans and Italian prisoners there," he said, "but I don't know, you know, where the colored be."  He said, "That's a whitey waiting room," he said, "go out on the street."  So I went out and I saw these Jacksonville policemen and everywhere I'm looking up to try to see what sign says colored, because I knew it was one somewhere, I'd never been to Jacksonville before, and I saw this black, he had a white coat on, like, and then I could see the German and Italian prisoners eating in there through the plate glass window, and I went to go in this door and just as I stepped in the cop grabbed me by the collar, slammed me on the ground, and put his foot on my neck, pulled his pistol out, I knew it was his pistol because I could feel it up against my head, he must have twisted it because I could feel the blood running down.  He said, "You black son of a bitch, I'll blow your black brains out, you know better than to go in there where those white people are."  The white people were the German and Italian prisoners, and here I am, spent the entire war from the beginning to the end, and he wanted to kill me because I wasn't trying to go in there to eat, I was trying to get information where I could go and eat and two shore patrolmen, [U.S.] Navy shore patrolmen ran up and said, "What's going on, or what--?"  They said, "This nigger wants to go in there where those white people are," the Germans and Italian prisoners or what, so he took his foot off my neck and they got me and said, "Come on," so they put me in, I said, "My sea bag's in there."  They said, "Don't worry about it, you got to get, we got to get you out of here," said, "if we don't," said, "they're gonna take you to jail or what."  And what, so he took me and said, "We'll get your sea bag."  And they took me to their sickbay and they just washed it up a little bit, say, just a little skin broken, you know, where he had twisted it, you know, or what, so.  That was my greetings back after the war.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know?
Story_ID: 531553
Speaker 1: Were you received that way in other U.S. cities upon your return?
Speaker 2: All over the South, yes, absolutely, all over the South, yes, yes.  Well, from Jacksonville [Florida], I went to Corpus Christi, Texas, and, in Corpus Christi, they had a multiengine training base, aviation, and I was in charge of the barracks, the officers' barracks, and instead of eating in the officers' mess, we ate general mess, and they had a table set aside for the blacks over in the corner.  Well, President Truman [President Harry S. Truman] had put out, circulated a letter, I forget the number, I think it was 928 [sic. Executive Order 9981] or what, said there shall be no discrimination in the [U.S.] military, in any eating, sleeping or recreation facilities.  So they had, and I got in line, and the master-at-arms came and said, "You in the wrong line," said, "the Negroes are over there," or what.  So he said, "And you eat on that table over there," I said, "No," I said, "I'm gonna eat here at the regular mess."  He said, "We're doing you a favor, you don't have to wait in the long line, go over there at that table," said, "and you get in the line over there."  I said, "Well, this is general mess, and I was told to eat in general mess."  He said, "You're a smart nigger, we're gonna fix you."  So he went and got the chief, chief said, "I'm gonna kick your ass and get you out of that line if you don't," he said, "now get out of the line."  I said, "No, I'm not gonna get out of the line," I said, you kick--I said, "It comes two ways," I said, "you're gonna kick my ass," I said, "you got to bring ass to kick ass."  He said, "Oh, you're one of them smart ones aren't you?"  He said, "You just wait," he went and I saw about five or six of 'em coming, you know?  So I just stepped out of line and I went back, and then about, went to the barracks, so about two hours later they called down, said, "Phillips [HistoryMaker Lanier W. Phillips]," you know, on the PA system, "report to administration." I went up, they said, "You got one hour to be up to hangar six."  Said, "You're being transferred." Said, "You're leaving."  I said, "Well I got clothes in the laundry and the things like that," and me--he said, "You got one hour," said, "you're going to Opa-locka, Florida Naval Air Station [Naval Air Station Miami; Coast Guard Air Station Miami, Florida]."  So, I, I went and went to Opa-locka.  And I remember in Opa-locka--
Speaker 1: Wait a min- were you stunned though, by the situation?  The fact that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --you were--
Speaker 2: --thought it--
Speaker 1: --here, you had fought in the war [World War II, WWII]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I thought about St. Lawrence [Canada], I thought about how nice they treated me in St. Lawrence, people who had never seen a black man before, people who gave up everything, who bathed me, who fed me like a baby, put me, put their husbands' clothing on me, took me to their home and put me in their bed and here I come back to my own country and this is what, well they labeled me as a troublemaker from then on.  When I got to Opa-locka, that's about eight miles out of Miami [Florida], the Naval Air Station.  I remember Joe Louis fought Billy Conn, so we had radio, didn't have television, you know, so we were separated, so the black barracks, we all, everybody was there again, he fought Billy Conn, now he knocked Billy Conn out in the thirteenth round and boy we cheered and was happy.  The white sailors came, we heard something bam, bam, bam, they busted out the windows and kicked the door down (laughter) and all and everything, you know?  Or what, coming after us, you know, because Joe Louis had knocked out Billy Conn, you know, but they stopped it you know, the master-at-arms, master-at-arms is like a police, the [U.S.] Navy police, you know, master-at-arms, and they stopped it, but they never did anything to them or what.
Story_ID: 531554
Speaker 1: So I request captain mess, and they raised sand about that, and the Commander Moore [ph.] from Mississippi, I'll never forget his name, oh he was a racist, oh I'm telling you.  At that time, the blacks would cook potatoes and mash up like mash potatoes and put lye, Red Devil Lye in there and put on their hair to straighten it out, they call it conk, they would conk their hair.  So one of the fellows, they made me master-at-arms, and went to the mess, and Commander Moore looked at the fellow, he said, "What's that on your hair?"  He said nothing, he said, "That's my hair."  He said, look, he said, "God made dogs and God made niggers," he said, "he made niggers the way niggers should be, and dogs the way dogs should be, so you get that off your hair, whatever that is you got on there."  He said, "Phillips [HistoryMaker Lanier W. Phillips]," I was the master-at-arms, said, "take 'em and cut his hair," so we went and he cut his hair and went back, Commander Moore, that was Opa-locka Naval Air Station [Naval Air Station Miami; Coast Guard Air Station Miami] in Florida.
Speaker 2: So what do you think that was about?  That was about a white man not wanting black man to appear--
Speaker 1: Well, he's just a outright Mississippi racist and he'd tell you, "I'm from Mississippi," he'd tell you that in a minute, before you knew his name, he'll tell you he's from Mississippi.  Well anyway, they transferred me from there and sent me back to Jacksonville [Florida], to Cecil Field [Naval Air Station Cecil Field; Cecil Airport, Florida], about twenty miles out of Jacksonville and they finally gave me leave, the people who had spent the entire war [World War II, WWII] overseas and had never got furloughed or anything in ninety days, so I went to Chattanooga [Tennessee], and from Chattanooga I went to Detroit [Michigan], my aunt had moved to Detroit and I went to Detroit and stayed there just about all the ninety days.
Story_ID: 531555
Speaker 1: And went back down there and they put me on board the destroyer again, and the [USS] Gearing, DD-710, and after the Gearing, I went on board the Forrest Royal [USS Forrest B. Royal (DD-872)], and went to Korea.
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: This was in '50 [1950], 1950, we were posted from navy yard, we had left Pensacola, Florida, we did plane guard for the cadets in Pensacola, Florida, then when they carry your qualification, learn how to land on the carriers, and we went to get some new guns.  And orders came, instead of going back to Pensacola in July, '50 [1950], said, proceed to Sasebo, Japan, at fast as possible speed.  So we left and went down, we stopped at Calibrum [ph.], and fired the guns to get some practice, went down to Panama, through the canals, up through Pocahontas Bay into San Diego [California], stopped and refueled and got supplied and got into Sasebo, Japan, and we took on eight thousand rounds of white phosphorus.  White phosphorus, you can't put it out with water or anything, and I would fill all the magazines, all the--and we went over and went, the Taedong River, thirty-seven miles, the Chinese was, had come into it and we had orders to, to destroy all the American equipment.  So we fired eight thousand rounds of white phosphorus, the, all the paint on the guns had just melted off we fired.  And then we had to back down because the Chinese and North Koreans were firing at us with tanks or what, and it wasn't enough room in the Taedong River to turn around, so we had to back down that thirty-seven miles out to the China Sea [South China Sea].  And then we went around to Wonsan Harbor, and fired there, and what, and then Christmas of '50 [1950], was at Hungnam [North Korea], and I remember that, that was one hell of a day, Christmas, 1950.  All the Americans had made it down to Hungnam, retreating from the chosen reservoir and all the army and they had, looked like the entire navy was in there, you know, they was loading the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] and soldiers and all, whatever they could get on to get 'em out and get 'em back to Japan, you know?  Because the Chinese and Japanese, I mean Chinese and North Koreans, they was taking over.

Speaker 1: At this point, this was almost ten years after you had joined the [U.S.] Navy, did you recognize any changes in how you were treated?
Speaker 2: Yes, changes had--began to make some changes but it still only, you know, well mess attendants, Truman [President Harry S. Truman] had put the order [Executive Order 9981] out, you know?  And then, they, I wanna backtrack, around 1943, well I think '42 [sic. 1944], Dewey [Thomas E. Dewey] ran against Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], and Dewey said, if I'm elected president, people will--the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] was writing about the blacks because of the Philadelphia 15 [sic. Port Chicago 50], the secretary of the Navy [James Forrestal] went down to Norfolk [Virginia] to visit the Philadelphia 15 and he said, "I don't wanna see a black hand touch a plate I have to eat out of."  He wanted all Filipinos, you know, so some of the, they made the blacks put on white gloves.
Speaker 1: Wait, who was this in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: This, this was--
Speaker 1: It was an officer?
Speaker 2: The secretary of the navy.
Speaker 1: Oh, the secretary of the navy.
Speaker 2: Navy, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so they court martialed fifteen [sic.] of them, some went to prison, and what.  And the ones that's still living during the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration, he pardoned them, say that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And why were they targeted?
Speaker 2: --well because they rebelled against, that they were nothing but sea going chambermaids and they wanted them to wear white gloves to, to serve and they didn't make the Filipinos, who is that, well they, you know they kicked all the blacks out of the Navy in 1922, say, and they would take the Filipinos off the island, no training, just put 'em right on board ship, but they only gave them half pay, which was about eleven dollars a month because the pay was twenty-one dollars a month, but the Filipinos only got half pay see, and they were treated just like the blacks but the difference was in the States, especially in the southern ports, when the blacks go on liberty, they had to sit in the back of the buses and things, the Filipinos could sit anywhere, and the Filipinos could go into the white restaurants, in the white clubs and things and the blacks couldn't. So, a controversy would be when they get back on board ship, back on board ship they the same as the blacks, see?  The blacks and Filipinos, and they would always, you know, they would make remarks or something about you know, you can't sit where we sit or what and fights would start so it would always be fights, it--one thing you learn, a black in the Navy learns how to fight, you learn how to fight.  But now, here's something, Roosevelt, when Dewey and Roosevelt, Dewey said if he was elected president, the Negro could be any rating he's qualified to be.  Roosevelt said, "I'll do it now," and he set up Camp Robert Smalls, at Great Lakes [Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois], a boot camp, but when they finished boot camp they couldn't go to a Navy school, like for a hospital corpsman or machinist made or signal and what, they send them to Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], and I think they gave Hampton $3 million, which was an awful lot of money back then, and they built barracks and even built a swimming pool at Hampton, which they didn't have, and they sent 'em there.  But when they got out of there, they came out as third class and different ratings, but they weren't allowed aboard ship, they put 'em in port companies and they would put 'em, load than more ships, you know, and unloading ships and things, and that's what happened when the Mount Hood [USS Mount Hood (AE-11)] blew up in Port Chicago, killed everybody on the ship.  They had three ships, all black, loading bombs and all kinds of ammunition and things and when it blew up and killed everybody, the next shift they wanted them to go over to another pier and load their ammo and things like that, and they refused, so they court martialed them, they court martialed them and what, kicked 'em out of the Navy and sent some to prison.  President Clinton pardoned them, the ones that's still living, during his administration.
Speaker 1: So how many blacks are we talking about at this time in the Navy?
Speaker 2: Oh, quite a few, but everyone, they weren't allowed aboard ship, but every battle that's ever been fought during World War II [WWII], African Americans were involved.
Story_ID: 531557
Speaker 1: And were you ever recognized at the time?  Were you recognized for what happened in Newfoundland [Canada]?  Were you recognized after your service both in World War II [WWII] and in Korea?
Speaker 2: No.  No, what happened was I never knew the name of the place because when we got to Argentia [Naval Station Argentia, Canada], they wouldn't let me on the bus, they put me on the ship and I never saw any of the survivors, of the survivors, they separated me entirely then sent me to San Diego [California] and then sent me down to Port Hueneme [California] for training and sent me out in the Pacific until the war was over.
Speaker 1: So they didn't even make sure you had proper medical care?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I never saw a doctor.
Speaker 1: No follow up?
Speaker 2: No, no.  No follow up.  Well, what happened was I was nineteen fi- 1988, in [U.S.] Veterans magazine, they had something about the USS Truxtun [USS Truxtun (DD-229)], a reunion, and I was at the, the U.S. Naval Home [Armed Forces Retirement Home] in Gulfport, Mississippi, and a guy said to me, said, "I heard you talk about the Truxtun, say somewhere in Newfoundland, they're having a reunion or what," say, where?  So he showed me the magazine, but before that, the book, 'Standing into Danger' [Cassie Brown], had came out, I had moved back to Georgia, had came out and I found out about it, I saw something where a tragedy of a shipwreck in Newfoundland, 'Standing into Danger,' or what, by Cassie Brown.  So I wrote Cassie Brown, St. John's, Newfoundland, author of 'Standing into Danger,' and I got an answer back from her and she sent me a copy of the book and the name of Egner [Harry Egner], who he and I went up the cliff together, and he lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and he and his wife drove from Philadelphia down to Georgia, to visit me see.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the names of any of those other guys?
Speaker 2: Remember what?
Speaker 1: The names of some of the other guys who were with you in Newfoundland?  The people who were with you, do you remember the names of some of the other people who were with you?
Speaker 2: For, for the reunion?
Speaker 1: When you were shipwrecked.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  I remember, yes I remember all the blacks named, all the blacks' names, my boss was third class, Henry Langston, and he was from Truxton, Virginia [Truxton, Portsmouth, Virginia], we said, say well okay, you, they said, if you're going?  I said, "I'm going," I said, "because I'm, you're gonna die," I said, "you can't hardly move," ice was all over us forming on the stand.  And, they said, well if you do, said, go to, well the name of the ship was Truxtun, T-R-U-X-T-U-N, he was from a place by the name of Truxton, T-R-U-X-T-O-N, Truxton, Virginia, right outside of Portsmouth [Virginia].  He said go see my family, and Billy Gene Turner, was from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Houston [Earl Houston] was from New York, you know, or what.  Well, I knew their names and what but, but I never heard anymore or anything from them, or what.  And when Egner came down to Georgia to see me and what, I never heard anything, but when I heard about the reunion in '88 [1988], I couldn't buy me a ticket fast enough to go to St. Lawrence [Canada].  Well I called first, I got the telephone number of the people in St. Lawrence, and Ena Farrow Edwards was the--coordinating that whole thing, and I, I went there in '88 [1988], and I have tapes of that.
Speaker 1: And you finally got the recognition (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I got the--
Speaker 1: --you deserved.
Speaker 2: --I got the recognition, they all remembered me, all the miners who did the rescue, they remembered that one black, you know, that survived the whole thing, and the whole town had always talked about that one black and the peoples wondering what happened to me after and things, and then in '92 [1992], I went back again and in '96 [1996], I went back to make the documentary, 'Dead Reckoning: The Lanier Phillips Story,' which I'll give you a copy of it, you know?  And since then, magazines, many, many magazines have written articles and things like that, and the tape you saw on 'The Today Show' ['Today'] or what, and I just came back from Pascagoula [Mississippi], they're launching out the new Truxtun [USS Truxtun (DDG-103)], and Lewis [Edward Lewis] and I--who was a survivor, Lewis was a survivor, the two of us that made it there, it's four still living, two is in real bad health.
Speaker 1: So that was a huge turning point in your life?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Oh yes, I, I--their humanity and their kind treatment, the love that the people showed me in St. Lawrence, erased the hatred that I had in me for all white people.  I hated all white people, because of the treatment I had gotten in all my life, you know, since a child or what and these people with their love and humanity and the kindness they showed me, I hate no one today.  I hate no one, because I know we're all God's children, you know, and the people, I give the credit to the people of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland.
Speaker 1: That's beautiful.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 531558
Speaker 1: What year did you leave the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: Well even before, even before that I guess you decided you wanted some training?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  Well, I had tried and tried to change ratings and they could never get it off the ship and I, I wrote a letter.  When I wrote a letter and go through the chain of command like I should, I could never hear any answers or what, so I saw where they had elected a congressman in Detroit [Michigan], my mother [Celvia Woodall Phillips] had moved to Detroit.
Speaker 1: What year is this?
Speaker 2: That was, she moved to Detroit in, let's see '48 [1948], '49 [1949], oh around '49 [1949], I think she moved to Detroit, somewhere in there.  Anyway I, I went to Detroit and I registered to vote, using her address, I registered to vote in Detroit to establish legal domicile, and this, I'll tell you when that was, this was in '52 [1952], I believe it was, '52 [1952], because the Korean War, remember, you know.  And I wrote Diggs and I wrote, I never did hear an answer from him.
Speaker 1: Who, Congressman Charles Diggs?
Speaker 2: Congressman Diggs, Charles Diggs and asked him if he could help me, and I wrote a letter to the Bureau of Naval Personnel, and I told 'em I felt that I was qualified for some technical rating other than, you know, mess attendant.  And I got orders back, report to Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida.  And they called me down to personnel and the division officer said, "Phillips [HistoryMaker Lanier W. Phillips], say have you ever heard of a chain of command?"  I said, "Yes sir," he said, "Why don't you use it?"  I said, "I don't understand what you, you're referring to?"  He said, "You've been writing the bureau," he didn't mention Congressman Diggs.  I said, "Yes," I said, "because your letter never got off the ship when I put it through the tube or what."  He said, "You got orders to go to Fleet Sonar School," he said, "but the captain wants to see you."  Captain, I went to see the captain, he said, "I've looked over the mess attendants records or what," he said, "and you're gonna be my personal steward."  I said, "Captain I've got orders to go to sonar school," he said, "Who?"  I said, "The bureau, Bureau of Naval Personnel."  He said, "We're going on this exercise," the name of the exercise was Razor's Edge [ph.], and I remember that clearly, and in the northern part of Europe.  He said, "You're going on that," I said, "Well I got orders to go to sonar school," he said, "You heard what I said."  And I went on, but when I come back, they had orders for me, which is when the ship docked, I was one of the first off the ship to get transportation and get down to Key West, you know, so I made it there in time, you know, what the orders had read.  And when I got to Key West, I waited and waited and waited to start class, I waited and waited, nothing.  So, I went down to see the counselor, I said, "When am I going to start class?"  He said, "You've got to have a clearance," he said, "because you can't come, it's, it's all classified matter," said, "you got to have a good clearance."  He said, "And we turned that over to the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], and they check your background, we got to know where your parents come from, where your great-grandparents come from, we got to know the entire history of your family."  I said, "Look, I'm from Georgia," I said, and they didn't keep records until, birth certificates and things until 1922, in Georgia, I said, "How're you gonna get records?"  He said, "We have nothing to do with that, it's up to the FBI," so he said, "you just got to wait."  So I waited, and waited, and they start a new class, a new class, so they called me down one day, and he said, "I got good news," I said, "When do I start class?"  He said, "No, I'll say, we're gonna make you chief steward," mate--mess attendant, he said, "but you got to volunteer and leave the school."
Story_ID: 531559
Speaker 1: So you were quite determined as a young man, you knew you wanted to have this technical training, and it reminds me of Frederick Douglass, who was determined to learn how to read.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Oh yes.  Well they told me that they'd make me chief if I'd volunteer to leave [Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida] and I said no, they said, "Well it's impossible for you to complete this course," he said, "You don't have the background," I said, well--he said, "You're gonna flunk out."  I said, "Well let me flunk out, don't throw me out," he said, "All right you'll start the next class," and I did and it was hard.
Speaker 1: It was hard?  Well you said that you were also saying that you were inspired by some of the, the writing and the speeches of Frederick Douglass--
Speaker 2: Oh yes--
Speaker 1: --they gave you courage.
Speaker 2: --yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: What were some of those?
Speaker 2: Well in 1866, when he was talking to the freed men, he said, "Our destiny is mainly in our own hands," he said, "if we compete in the race of life, it must be of our own energies and own exertions," say, "others may clear the road, but we must go forward or be left behind in the race of life."  He said, "If we are ignorant, the intelligence of other men will not guide us."  He said, "If we're poor, the riches of other men will do but little for us."  He said, "And if we are lazy and if we do little for our self," he said, "our destitution will only be more painful and harmful," and so it inspired me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what--
Speaker 2: --altogether.
Speaker 1: --did you do?
Story_ID: 531560
Speaker 1: What did you do as a result?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh.  When I finished sonar school [Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida], I got orders to report to the USS Gearing (DD-710), I went aboard that night, it said, by 0800 in the morning, well I, I went aboard that afternoon before and when I went aboard, I gave my orders, said, reporting for duty, the OD said, "Very well, give me your orders." I give 'em the orders, he told the messenger, "Take him to the mess attendants' compartment."  I said, "No sir," I said, "I'm a sonar tech."  He said, "You're a what?"  I said, "I'm a sonar tech," he said, "Let me see those orders," so he looked at the orders and saw that I was sonar tech, said, "Okay," said, "take him back in O Division."  I went back there and had a bunk.  Since they'd assigned me to the compartment head and signed me to a bunk, the next morning they woke me up before reveille, said, "The inspection board is on board," said, "the ship is getting ready to go to Gitmo [Guantanamo Bay Naval Base], down at Guantanamo, Cuba," they said, "and they're here to inspect sonar, you're a first class, you're our senior sonar tech."  So, I went down, and boy they went up one side of my behind and down the other, went back, and the equipment wasn't like it should be, it wasn't working or what, they said, "When it's ready you notify the ASW [anti-submarine warfare] officer, and they'll notify us, and we'll come back."  For seventy-two hours, three days, I worked, maybe one hour of sleep a night if that, worked and got it going, come back and we passed, went to Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that's where they hold the exercises, went down and made one of the highest marks made down there, you know?  In our submarine warfare and we went on and I left and went back to sonar school for instructor duty and I went through instructor school and what, and I worked with a naval oceanographic outfit out of Suitland, Maryland, now they're in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.  But they established teachers on the Yosemite, I was transferred to the USS Yosemite [USS Yosemite (AD-19)], they had simulators setup just there, and I was teaching on our submarine warfare, my last days in the [U.S.] Navy before I got discharged.
Speaker 1: And so you were teaching white men?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: How were you received?
Speaker 2: Well, they were surprised and one officer who was an ensign on the Gearing, he had rose up to lieutenant commander, and he came aboard because we're having what we call CIC, Combat Information Center, in this room, sonar shack here, radar over here and things just like on a real destroyer, it's all simulated or what, and they would go like a submarine or tank, I would operate the submarine and then, but I would have everything recorded and just like a, a motion picture screen or what, and I would mark it.  I had two other sonars, two white sonars working for me, I was in charge, I was an instructor and they would mark the submarine and they would mark the ship and they'd make mistakes and when they'd make mistakes, we would note it, they would have it critiqued and this one officer when he came aboard, he said, "I know you don't I?"  I said, "Yes, Phillips [HistoryMaker Lanier W. Phillips]," I said, "I remember you."  He said, "What are you doing here?"  I said, "I'm sonar tech," I said "I'm the one that's gonna, you know, give you your classes," I said, "and I'll teach you about submarine warfare."  And he looked, looked at the other officers and what, and went on into there in CIC.  And I must say that I was fair but I was a little, a little rough--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --because when they come back, if he made a mistake I would point it right out to him and tell him that was wrong, I'd tell him, you change course when they ask for the com, you gave it and told 'em what course you were on, what you're--knots you were making, but instead of telling him to come right, maybe to zero nine zero, you told 'em to come right to zero nine three and that was a bad mistake because the submarine could have fired a torpedo into you.  I said, now we're gonna do it over, you go back, (laughter) or what.  Well that was fair, but you know, whereas I might have been a little different--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --because I remembered him so well, some of the things he had said to me.
Speaker 1: And so you were making history?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if I was making history or not, they, I've been told that I was the first black sonar tech in the United States Navy, I've been told.  And one sonar tech who has retired, and I'll show you some of his writings, that interviewed me for Black History Month, called 'The Deck Plate' ['The View from the Deck Plate,' Jeff Edwards] you might can pull it up on your--I'm sure you can pull it up on your computer, Edwards [Jeff Edwards] is his name and he writes for, I think he's got about 250,000 subscribers or what and, he did the research and said I was their first African American sonar tech, and--
Speaker 1: Must feel pretty good?
Speaker 2: --or what.
Story_ID: 531561
Speaker 1: I got out of the [U.S.] Navy, I had a job, well while I was going to school, I had all kinds of job offers saying get out of the Navy, (unclear), GE [General Electric] and all of them, well I was discharged in Boston [Massachusetts] and went to EG&G International [Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier, Inc.; EG&G]--
Speaker 2: In 1961?
Speaker 1: --sixty-one [1961], as a technical specialist, you know, in oceanography, and I had a lot of experience, you know, or what in doing that.
Speaker 2: Well tell me about your experiences working with Jacques Cousteau.
Speaker 1: Oh, well he and Dr. Harold Edgerton [Harold Eugene Edgerton], who was chairman of the board, who was also a professor at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and Dr. Edgerton would invite me to come over to MIT and I'd sit in on some of his classes in the engineering classes or what.  And I was a supervisor at the plant from the seismic recorder, or what, and when they lost the nuclear submarine Thresher [USS Thresher (SSN-593)], they used one of those recorders, you know, their 254 and 259 recorder to find it in the seismic scan sonar.  And I worked with men, and Cousteau was a friend of Dr. Edgerton's, and we had a saltwater tank and he wanted an incandescent lamp for underwater photography.  And Dr. Edgerton and some of the engineers got together and they did the proto- I did the prototype, they just drew the schematic out and I drew the prototype and did the lamp and it worked good on the Calypso [RV Calypso] and they named it the Calypso lamp after his ship, that was the name of Cousteau's ship.  And when we went down to Hatteras off of, Cape Hatteras off North Carolina, and the [USS] Monitor and the [USS] Merrimack in the Civil War, you know, the, the ships sunk, that's how they found that with some of the equipment and--
Speaker 2: Do you get some of the credit for helping?
Speaker 1: No, I was--
Speaker 2: Event?
Speaker 1: --just a, I was just a technician, you know?  Which was my job you know or what.  The same if anyone, you know, who's a technician, the engineers get the credit, you know?
Speaker 2: Well how were you treated by Jacques Cousteau, now this was a guy who--
Speaker 1: Oh, oh--
Speaker 2: --was lauded for his work and he also did time in the navy--
Speaker 1: --listen--
Speaker 2: --the French Navy.
Speaker 1: --listen the man was great, I shook his hand and talked to him all the time or what and he said, "Well, will it do this?  Or can we do this?"  And he'd make changes in the schematic and I would go to the bench with the other technicians and say, let's put this resistor, you know, let's change it from three megaohms to you know, so many kiloohms or what.  Or let's change this from ten microfiber capacitors, and let's put a three-henry, you know, inductor in this like here, or let's put a junction here, you know, like that and then we'd do it and then we'd try it out and see how it'd work or what.  They, and then Cousteau would look at it and approve it or disapprove it, or what, and he approved it.
Story_ID: 531562
Speaker 1: You were treated with great, a great deal of respect from Cousteau [Jacques Cousteau] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, absolutely, absolutely.  He's a great man, and so did Dr. Edgerton [Harold Eugene Edgerton]--I wasn't enrolled as a student at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but I used to go over there and sit in with the students, you know?  See, Edgerton, they had three professors over there, Edgerton, Germeshausen [Kenneth J. Germeshausen], and Grier [Herbert Grier], and Edgerton with his light source and strobe lights, he developed the light source that would put out the nearest thing to sunlight, thirteen thousand lumens and it could go to the deepest known depths and his cameras, you know, with the (unclear) sight lens, which I worked with or what, they took pictures down thirty-six thousand feet, whereas the deepest known depth is forty-four thousand, you know.  I mean Mariana straits [Mariana Trench] between Guam and Palau, you know, whereas the mantle is only about two miles you know in the Mariana straits, whereas on the continent it's about twenty-nine miles down to the mantle.  See in the next deepest waters off Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rican canyon [Puerto Rico Trench], it's about five miles deep, twenty miles wide and five miles deep, you know.  And, well I'm very familiar with transduces and things like that and that's why they, they hired me, just like that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know?
Speaker 1: And you had studied.  And, and when you went to sonar school [Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you were using every resource possible to make sure you could absorb this information because you didn't have a full high school education or a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --college education?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were competing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with these guys?
Speaker 2: Right, but I knew nothing about transduces, or anything like that and then my, my hardest problem was the math, you know?  And I had to deal with things like Greek and Arabic symbols, say like the, the symbol delta which means increments of small changes thereof, and that's the Greek, and say like prime, which means stabilization in everything except that.  Prime in depth means apparent, everything else it means stabilization, you know, and things like that and--
Speaker 1: So you were able to apply this knowledge (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: In your work with Jacques Cousteau?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes, I applied all of that knowledge.
Speaker 1: Did you help also with the Aqua-lung?
Speaker 2: No, no.  No, I didn't have any dealing with that but, I helped with the cameras and the light sources, like their photographs they made of their nuclear submarine Thresher [USS Thresher (SSN-593)] when it crashed off the continental shelf, and when they launched the bombs off Spain, in '63 [1963], the Alvin out of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution [Woods Hole, Massachusetts], Dr. Ballard [Robert D. Ballard], all the equipment that they used, I worked with that equipment, that was from EG&G International [Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier, Inc.; EG&G] and I was the one that calibrated the lens and you know, built it, the prototypes and all and things like that.
Story_ID: 531563
Speaker 1: What did you do next?
Speaker 2: What'd I do now?
Speaker 1: What did--what did you do next?  Did you get married at some point?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I got married in Boston [Massachusetts] and I got married, well my wife had two children, well she had more than two but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's your wife's name?
Speaker 2: --Virginia [Virginia Phillips].  Her maiden name was Merritt [ph.].
Speaker 1: And when was she born and where?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was born in Providence, Rhode Island and she is part Narragansett Indian [Native American], I don't know if you ever read about the Indian Tarahumara that ran in the Boston Marathon barefoot many years ago?  That was her cousin or what and yeah we had five children.
Speaker 1: What year did you get married?
Speaker 2: I got married to Virginia, I got out in '61 [1961], '49 [1949], '60 [1960], Terry [Terry Phillips] was born '60 [1960], I got married (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Around the--
Speaker 2: --in--
Speaker 1: --time--
Speaker 2: --no--
Speaker 1: --you retired?
Speaker 2: --before I got out of the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got--
Speaker 1: From the--
Speaker 2: --married to her--
Speaker 1: --late '50s [1950s]--
Speaker 2: --in '60 [1960], '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: All righty, and you had five kids?
Speaker 2: Five kids.
Speaker 1: And what are their names?
Speaker 2: Norton [Norton Phillips], Lenny [Lenny Phillips], Jonathan [Jonathan Phillips, Sr.], Vonzia [Vonzia Phillips], V-O-N-Z-I-A, my daughter, and Terry.
Speaker 1: T-E-R?
Speaker 2: T-E-R-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were you able to balance work life and your, and your career at sea and?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I--
Speaker 1: With family?
Speaker 2: I--when I started working when I got out the Navy, I lived in the projects, Columbia Point projects in Boston, and during the school integration in the '60s [1960s], or what, my kids, they come home--what really turned the point for me, they come home day will glass all in her hair where they would ambush the buses and throw rocks at the black kids.  Well, I was involved with the community in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] and what we would do, would go to the merchants and say give us some apples, oranges and things and when the white kids would come to Roxbury to go to school, we would meet the buses and give 'em a banana or a bunch of grapes or what, say welcome to Roxbury, you know, the school thing.  But the black kids on the bus going over to Charlestown in South Boston [sic.], the grownups would throw rocks and, you know, at the bus and have police escort.  I don't know, but Life magazine, their cover would show the black attorney [HistoryMaker Theodore C. Landsmark] being beaten by the school, high school kids, with the American flag right at City Hall [Boston City Hall, Boston, Massachusetts], and Mayor White [Kevin White] was the mayor at the time.  And I decided to go to Georgia, my wife died, or what, well I had bought a house in Mattapan [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: What year is this?
Speaker 2: That they was throwing the rocks?
Speaker 1: Well you said your wife died.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my wife died in 1970, and my youngest son was four years old.
Speaker 1: So you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or what--
Speaker 1: --had a--
Speaker 2: --so I raised the kids there alone, I never got married again.
Speaker 1: --wow.
Speaker 2: I raised the kids myself.
Story_ID: 531564
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) While you guys were still together in Boston [Massachusetts] though, you were dealing with integration?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Race riots?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you also in Boston, even before the kids went through all this stuff, you met [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  I met Dr. King, I decided to go to church at Reverend Haynes' church [Twelfth Baptist Church, Boston, Massachusetts] on Warren Street, right where Warren and Walnut Avenue separate, Michael Haynes was the pastor there and Dr. King spoke that Sunday and after the church and just say this is, you know, Martin Luther King, he was working on his doctorate at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], or what, and as the pastor always--the entrance, when they, you know, when they finish preaching, go out, I shook his hand and told him how I enjoyed his teaching, you know, or what.  And I didn't hear no more until he started the bus boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott] in Alabama, you know?  I said, oh boy, he's down in Alabama now, you know?  Or what, what he's doing, and I used to watch him on the news and things like that.  And when I saw them cross the Pettus Bridge [Edmund Pettus Bridge] there, I told my wife [Virginia Phillips], I've got to go, and I left the next day for Selma [Alabama] and I went down there, I slept right in front of Brown Chapel [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama] for five days there, for five days, or what.  So I had to go, it's all in the tape, you'll see that, you'll see it in the tape, I'll give you a copy.
Speaker 1: So based upon your experience and growing up in Georgia, living in Tennessee, your experiences on the ship, you knew that you had to fight for racial (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes--
Speaker 1: --justice.
Speaker 2: --Yes.  I felt that if I could go through the beginning through the end of the war [World War II, WWII], or what, fighting for freedom and justice, I could sure go to Alabama.  And when I got to Alabama, Reverend Virgil Wood [Virgil A. Wood], up on Blue Hill Avenue, had an office, he was with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC], he told me, you know, how I would have to get to Selma, you know, fly down in Montgomery [Alabama], when I got to Montgomery, they would--I had to change planes in Atlanta [Georgia] and Montgomery, would be people with white coat on, you know, that'd take us up with a van.  And we got on and, when, going up, I think that's Highway 81 [sic.], I believe it is.  When we got to Selma there, everywhere you look, you look down the barrel of a gun, even little kids, I don't know if they had BB guns or what, everybody and the foresters and the county people, everybody had guns and everywhere you look, you look down the barrel of a gun.  And they began to feed us at Brown Chapel there, and hold services, and even today, before Dr. King came down, you know, for the march, Reverend Vivian [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. C.T. Vivian] and Reverend Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth], those people stand out, and Hosea.  I remember one night (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hosea?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hosea Williams, he was there and they had this podium built, a box like, what we call the wall, we weren't allowed to go across, you know, these horses, how they block the street of, or what, he was there and this Baptist member said, "If you people leave us alone, I'll pay every one of you way back to where you come from," or what.  And he asked Hosea, said, "How close are you to Dr. King?"  And Hosea said, "I'm as close to Dr. King as one can be without being King himself," you know.  And we'd have--kids would get up and sing and go twenty-four hours a day, no stopping or anything.  And Reverend Shuttlesworth, when they, we went down to Dallas County Courthouse [Selma, Alabama], this was before they marched to Montgomery, and Jim Clark there, you know, he beat 'em and he said, don't beat us, you know, arrest us or what.
Story_ID: 531565
Speaker 1: But the thing that really got me and made me think about St. Lawrence [Canada], when at Browns Chapel [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama], Reverend Vivian [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. C.T. Vivian] said, "We're going over to the church, white church tomorrow," and they had a high ranking priest, a Presbyterian priest from California there with us, he was gonna lease, it was a Presbyterian white church, and went over and the minister that preached, met us at the door, said, "You're not coming in here," said, "not in my church."  And this, this Presbyterian priest from California, he said, "It's not your church, it's God's church."  He said, "Well you just stand there and you'll see," you know, he said, "the police is on their way, we have already called 'em." So, they did, we didn't get in, in other words, we went back to Brown Chapel, you know,  and I remember going in to, they'd feed us in there, the entrance of the Brown Chapel.  They had a little side entrance, where you go in, that's where we would go, in that side entrance, they had a kitchen back there and they would feed us.  And the projects, it's a projects, single story buildings all around there, and the people would take who they could and we'd sleep on the floor, or what.  But a lot of people slept on the grass out there, and on the streets and what, and so they would let us take a bath and what, you know, things like that.  But the state troopers and the police would be taking pictures, if they see the local blacks and what, you know, and if they work somewhere, they could get fired, you know, that's why the blacks didn't participate, you know, some did, but some couldn't, you know, because they'd lose their job.  If they was renting a house, they'd get evicted, and things like that.  And, we went into, I went in to get a sandwich, chicken sandwich, they fed us a lot of chicken, and this little boy, he said, "Can I have a sandwich?"  And the lady said, no wait, said, "We're gonna feed all these people first," said, "and then come there."  And she said, "Well I've been on the wall," they called it wall, be out singing, and people would be speaking and things like that, out in front of Brown, that faces the chapel here, and this was like over here, where they had us, you know, say, you can't go past this area.  And, so he said, well wait and we're finished and so the little boy come out on that side entrance, I come out with him so, I asked him, how old he was or what, and he told me, so I said, "Here, take part of the sandwich," and he said no.  And I thought about St. Lawrence, and yeah, I, I dream about that kid now.  (Crying) He said, "I'm gonna wait until all you good people eat," I'm sorry about that, these memories come back and I, I see those things, and I hate to talk about it.  But I dream about that kid all the time.
Speaker 2: Who was that kid, symbolized to you?
Speaker 1: I don't know, here's this kid, his parents couldn't do what he was doing, he would get up on that thing and he would sing, or what and I just got attached to the kid and I, he did things his parents couldn't do because his parents would be fired off the job or evicted or what and this kid he just, he would get up there and he would sing and groups of 'em would sing and things.  And I talked to that kid, I, you know, and I thought about my kids, and here this kid would face all them bigots and the racist, this kid would get right up in front of 'em, you know, things and they would do poems and they would sing, mostly sing, you know, things and then, you know, and they would be, the racist would be out there and the state troopers with the Confederate flag, you know, painted on the fender, the front fender and on the front door of the cars, you know and things like that.  And this kid he, you know, he would face 'em all and everything, the courage he had.  I just got overwhelmed with that kid.
Story_ID: 531566
Speaker 1: Did you come face to face with Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] again in Alabama?
Speaker 2: Not as close as I did that Sunday when I shook his hand, but I saw him, I saw him and I saw him on other occasions, I saw him in Boston [Massachusetts], I saw him when he spoke to the legislative body there or what and when he spoke at, down at North Station [Boston, Massachusetts] there, I saw him there or what, but I didn't get a chance to talk to him.
Speaker 1: Where were you the day he was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was in Boston.  I was working for EG&G International [Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier, Inc.; EG&G] and I was living in the Columbia Point project [Boston, Massachusetts], I was working and I heard it on the radio and I left and went home.  And, and on Blue Hill Avenue, that's predominately a black street, or what, I went upon Blue Hill and they were rioting, you know, breaking windows out and throwing rocks and things like that, and it was just terrible for me, it was terrible for my family and all and I just really didn't know how to deal with it, I didn't know how to deal with it, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a loss--
Speaker 2: --really didn't--
Speaker 1: --of, a loss of hope.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.  Because I knew about other, you know, blacks who were in leadership roles and things like that, you know, and I, but he was the man, he was the man.  And I think he had the confidence and the trust of 99 percent of the blacks in America, sure there were people like the woman who tried to stab him in New York [New York], and what, and there were some people that I call, I don't know what to call 'em or what.  I guess it goes back to slavery when they tried to escape and they would go to the other slaves and say, come on we can escape tonight, and go, he said, no, the slave master he treats me good, I'm not gonna do that, or what.  But we have people like that here.  I was talking to a young man the other day, well I went down on, what is it?  I Street I believe, to the Big Brothers of America [Big Brothers Big Sisters of America], and told 'em I would like to be a Big Brother, take a young kid, you know, a boy or what, and they did the investigating and things like that, they turned me down, I felt bad.  But the reason they turned me down, I could understand it, they want somebody to have a home, you know?  Or what, and I'm living in a institution, you know?  And I'm eighty-four years old, you know, and things, I said, well I can take the kid and, and buy him a pair of shoes instead of the sneakers and I can take him down to The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts [The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.] and show him that side, I can take him to a ball game and things like that.  He said, well, you can meet some family, you know, and they'll let you take it or what, say but we can't, you know.  Well, I can understand that, here I am in a institution, you might say, you know, Armed Forces Retirement Home, and I couldn't do that.
Story_ID: 531567
Speaker 1: I taught (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You were able to instill that kind of love and guidance in your own children, because you--
Speaker 1: Oh yes--
Speaker 2: --ended up raising them by yourself--
Speaker 1: --oh yes.
Speaker 2: --when your wife [Virginia Phillips]--
Speaker 1: Yes--
Speaker 2: --passed away.
Speaker 1: --Yes.
Speaker 2: Tell me about that, you were starting to tell me about the period of integration and struggles the family endured?  You made it through?
Speaker 1: Yes, but I, I went to Georgia, and my last three kids, my three youngest grad- finished their high school in Georgia.  Now my youngest [Terry Phillips] was four years old, he was born in '66 [1966], he was four years old and my wife died, he did his undergrad at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], you know?  He was a history major and he got his law degree from LSU [Paul M. Hebert Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], and he, he did quite well on the LSAT, and he could have gone to Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] or Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but, they offered him a scholarship but, LSU gave him a scholarship and a thousand dollars a semester, you know, as a stipend, you know?
Speaker 2: Well as a, as a young child, you took them from Boston [Massachusetts], where they saw life up north?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: To the South?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Was that a big transition?
Speaker 1: Well, it was better in the South, you see because the racism in the South, you knew what it was and they didn't hide it and they more or less hid it in the North, you know, see, they had--and when I first went to Boston in 1941, from boot camp, when I joined the [U.S.] Navy, it was the liberal city in the United States, I think, because it--I remember taking their trolley car up Tremont Street or what, you know, and I don't ever, I don't think they had anything that's a black neighborhood back in 1941.  And I used to go to Estelle's [Boston, Massachusetts] and to their mothers lunch on Columbus Avenue and what, and as many white people be in there as black and I'd go to the Buddies' Club down in Boston Common [Boston, Massachusetts] and I would go to, you know, to the Cocoanut Grove [Boston, Massachusetts] where the, the big fire was, I used to go there, things and completely integrated and things.  But then, when they started the school integration, oh boy, it just changed, changed, altogether (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It angered everybody?
Speaker 1: A hundred and eighty degrees out, you know?  Louise Day Hicks, chairman of the school board, she sat on the steps of Boston, South Boston High School [Boston, Massachusetts], said, "No blacks are gonna come here."  But then they got rid of the, the, the courts got rid of the school committee altogether and brought Judge Garrity [W. Arthur Garrity Jr.] in to run the school department and each school formed a biracial committee, and I was on the, the Madison Park [Madison Park High School; Madison Park Technical Vocational High School, Boston, Massachusetts] biracial committee and I met Judge Garrity, talked to him and recommended who they'd get as headmaster, you know?
Speaker 2: Did it work (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Finally, in your students', in your kids' schools, integration?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Busing?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes, it worked, it worked because they would take this child regardless of where he lived and if he was black and put him in a predominantly white school and take a white kid, in a predominantly white school and put it or in a predominantly black school, and they thoroughly integrated the schools, but, it was a lot of turmoil, they'd throw buses and things like that and beat up kids.  Take South Boston High School, they would have to have polices walking all in corridors and things like that, when the buses bring the black kids in, they would have ten policemen on each side of the bus and things like that.  But Judge Garrity, I give him credit, and he got rid of the Boston School Committee altogether and formed a biracial committee in each school and they had a Black, a Hispanic, a Caucasian, and a other they called it, it could be a Chinese, or an Indian or what.  And they ran the school, they did the hiring of the principals and things like that, see all the high schools have headmasters, and below, they had principal.

Speaker 1: And your wife [Virginia Phillips] passed away in 1970?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: Did she--she had an illness?
Speaker 2: Yes, she had a stroke, a cerebral hemorrhage and died in the hospital.
Speaker 1: And so you had this awesome task of raising (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes--
Speaker 1: --the kids?
Speaker 2: --yes, yes.
Speaker 1: You took 'em back to Georgia?
Speaker 2: Yes, I worked seven to seven, I stayed in Boston [Massachusetts] for seven years and after all that, having such a problem, while I was going to school down on Huntington Avenue studying electrical theory, all the time I was working with EG&G [Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier, Inc.; EG&G], and then I went to Lee Institute [ph.], studied there, I was always going to school, always going to school.
Speaker 1: What did you do in Georgia, professionally?  What did your career go from there?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did all volunteer work in Georgia.  I went to Georgia, Lithonia [Georgia], and I found out people still had out houses, and things like that, and I knew they had a federal grant, federal grants for, you know, repairing people's homes and things like that, so I went to Decatur [Georgia] and I got literature on it and did some studying and I found out about it and then I found out that they were repairing white peoples' homes and not blacks.  And they still had outhouses, and things like that and I worked on that and I got the county, DeKalb County [Georgia] to put sewage systems, you know, on Mountain Street [Stone Mountain Street], there on Chestnut Road, Bruce Street and all those, I got 'em to, to do that or what, and I did a lot of things.  And I used to go to the schools and things and I used to teach and I used to do counseling and things like that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How long--
Speaker 2: --all the--
Speaker 1: --did you--
Speaker 2: --time.
Speaker 1: --do that?
Speaker 2: I did that until, after my youngest finished high school.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Terry [Terry Phillips], let me see, when did he finish high school?  I think he finished Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in '88 [1988], '84 [1984], I believe it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe, no, it was before '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: So in the '80s [1980s], in the mid-'80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 531569
Speaker 1: Did you start lecturing at some point?  Sharing your story?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, well I would lecture in the churches and things like that, different organizations and things like that.  Well I stepped on a, a lot of toes in the church that my parents [Celvia Woodall Phillips and Harvie Phillips] belonged to, Union Baptist Church [Union Missionary Baptist Church, Lithonia, Georgia], or what.  Because I spoke there, they had what they called men's day, and they asked me if I would be the keynote speaker, and I said yes, and I talked about some of the preachers who had very little education and some of the terms I used like, they run and up and down on the podium, on the platform, create a carnival like atmosphere and you can't understand what they're saying, yelling, and saying things that he heard other people preach like that, and I say we need teachers, not preachers, and things.   I said, and then he comes in and signs a contract or orally agreeing to be the spiritual leader for X amount of dollars and expects you to show how much you appreciate him by giving him money on their first anniversary and to give his wife money because she's married to him, or what, and, you know, and I just didn't think it was right, or what.  And I said, I think he should come out in the community like I was doing, you know?  And, and talking to the kids and teaching 'em their school, and I did a lot of tutoring in Lithonia [Georgia] to kids.  And kids, I know several kids who, and I told 'em if you finish and you go to college, I'll help you, I'll give you some money, or if you have any problems, come see me.  And kids would get into problems with the police and I'd go to court with 'em, and I would tell the police, I remember one in particular, a lady was selling, bootlegging some liquor, what she was, they had some kind of club and they sold liquor and they, they sent the undercover guy in and he bought a half a pint of liquor and they arrest everybody and her two daughters, one was thirteen I think, and one was sixteen, and they put 'em all in jail and I went to court and I went to chur- court and the judge fined the two girls seventy-five dollars apiece and I told him, "I think you're being harsh, Your Honor," and I explained who I was, I told him I was their counselor and these kids were home in their room.  I said, "I'm not questioning the fact that this undercover bought some liquor from the lady, and she was selling liquor without a license," I said, "but these two girls were in their room, and they arrested them and I don't think it's fair that you charge them seventy-five dollars."  He said, "Well I'll take it back," so the mother said, "Well I paid it," he said, "well go tell 'em I said give it back,"--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --you know?  And, a lot of the things they would, things would happen, they would arrest people and I would go to court.
Speaker 1: So it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know?
Speaker 1: --sounds like you had been a freedom fighter your entire life?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  And I still am.  But I have problems here at the home, with some of the African American residents.  One resident is a Washingtonian, he's young, I guess maybe in forties or what.  He did three years in the [U.S.] Army and we were talking, I read where the schools in Washington [D.C.], some didn't have air conditioning, and I thought it was so terrible and I was talking about it, they say they don't need air conditioning, they said they don't need to go to school, what they need to do is learn how to play basketball, and then they can make millions.  He said, "They go over there to that Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and they can't pass the bar or what," said, "and they, they can't do nothing," or what, and I said some harsh things to him and, and I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you're--
Speaker 2: --we're--
Speaker 1: --trying--
Speaker 2: --enemies--
Speaker 1: --you're trying to make sure that young African Americans today understand what their responsibility is?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Understand what their potential is?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 531570
Speaker 1: So as you look back now on your life, what do you think your greatest contributions have been?
Speaker 2: I don't think I contributed enough.  I think, I think I should have gone on to school, I should be going to school now, you know, or what.  I, but I have been, I know that there are many schools where if I put all my academic achievements through Navy schools and things like that and schools that I have gone and classes I took over at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and Northeastern University [Boston, Massachusetts], and things like that, I probably could get a bachelor's degree, you know, right off the bat, you know, or what.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you are very well educated.
Speaker 2: Say, well.
Speaker 1: What do you think you would like people to remember about what you did on the USS Truxtun [USS Truxtun (DD-229)]?
Speaker 2: Well I don't care so much them remembering me, what I would like for them to do is remember the price, now I'm working on a deal now with one fellow who lives here, Mel Williams [Melvin G. Williams, Sr.], his son [Melvin G. Williams, Jr.] is a vice admiral in the [U.S.] Navy, who was a mess attendant, another fellow, Richard Miller, who's over at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], he wrote the book, 'Messman Chronicles' ['The Messman Chronicles: African Americans in the U.S. Navy, 1932-1943,' Richard E. Miller] which you should read.  He retired from the Navy as a chief hospital corpsman, and a fellow from North Carolina, we went up to see Representative Clyburn [HistoryMaker James Clyburn], who's the majority whip for the Democratic Party and what.  Now the Tusk- the [U.S.] Air Force has the Tuskegee Airmen, the [U.S.] Army had the Buffalo Soldiers, and we're working to get recognition for the mess attendants of the Navy who fought in every battle that's ever been fought in the United States Navy during the war.  The African American mess attendants were involved, but we put the plaque there, the marker up in, last year, in Norfolk [Virginia] and we asked Congressman Clyburn to help us and we're going to talk to Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.] and a few other people and ask for some help or what.  And, to get recognition for the Navy mess attendants, and we fought in every single battle that's ever been fought in the United States Navy, but you don't hear about us like you do the Tuskegee Airmen, you don't hear about us like you do the Buffalo Soldiers, but if you would only read, if you would only read about Unit K-West and B-East, if you would only read where they used to make us take care of the captain's dog and things like that.  And on the destroyer where we had to wash the officers' underwear, and things like that, and the price we paid, you know, and what they did to us, and, or what, we're not recognized as that and I think we should and I think people should look into it.
Speaker 1: Very good.
Speaker 2: See.
Speaker 1: And when kids today hear your story and read about what you did in your life, from Lithonia, Georgia, to Chattanooga, Tennessee, to the USS Truxtun and beyond, what do you want them to learn from your journey?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like for you to read some, I must have a thousand letters, for kids and I would give you today when we go back over my room.  Recently I was down in Ocean City, Maryland, just across the street, is Delaware, I was at a school there and I spoke to the kids and I want you to read some of the their letters, I spoke to kids all over, I spoke to kids in, in elementary, high schools, universities throughout Canada.  I was at Bellingham, Washington at Western Washington University and that, read some of the, what the college students write and what the dean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did they--
Speaker 2: --wrote.
Speaker 1: --say to you?
Speaker 2: Well, they want me to come back and, you know, things I told 'em, things they'd never heard, heard of.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And I told 'em about, you know, my life and I'll give you an example, when I spoke over at Walter Reed [Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Washington, D.C.], well, last year, Black History Month I was the keynote speaker, I was the keynote speaker this year at Fort Detrick [Frederick, Maryland], and I'll show you some of the things they said and told me.  When I spoke, Black History Month, I tell them right off the bat, I know you've read about Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman and all of those people, so I don't think I wanna talk about them, because you know about them, I wanna tell you about Lanier Phillips [HistoryMaker Lanier W. Phillips], and his experience and people like me during my era and my time.  I wanna tell you what other people said and what other people did and I go on to tell them about it.

I want them to know and I, I did twenty years in the navy, in 1985, when I applied to go to the U.S. Naval Home [Armed Forces Retirement Home] in Gulfport, Mississippi, they wrote me and said you are not accepted at this time, I called 'em and I asked why?  A Mississippian told me that I can't discuss it with you on the phone, you have to come here.  I got in my car the next day and I drove and I went there, and I was the first one ever accepted because I threatened a lawsuit or what and I got into the navy home.  Now, when the Hurricane Katrina hit, this was in '05 [2005], when I went, when Katrina hit, they had twelve blacks there, only twelve, well, I had a heart problem so I had a triple bypass down there and I didn't like the medical facilities in Mississippi, so I came here to the home here so I could be treated at Washington hospital, at the VA in Walter Reed [Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Washington, D.C.], that's why I came here.
Speaker 1: So your message would be, to fight for what you want?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh absolutely, absolutely.  And don't accept, this is what I tell--oh I've had problems here, I had one fellow to tell me, and said, "Lanier [HistoryMaker Lanier W. Phillips]," has seen where I was a sonar tech, "I wasted some water, get your mop and bucket and get over there and clean it up."  Well he made a grave mistake, so I said, "You want me to get my mop, and my bucket?  And clean your water?"  I said, "I will." I said, "I will clean it up, but I'll mop it up with you."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I say, "And maybe your mother is better suited to do that than I."  Now I get criticism for that, yes, I can be harsh too.  See, and I do, and I do.

Speaker 1: So in your final word to the public out there, you would say?
Speaker 2: Don't accept racism and bigotry, don't accept it, fight it.  I will always accept it, and just like, James Miles [sic. William Porcher Miles], who designed the Confederate flag, when he said people would wanna know what it represents, and he said, the only criticism I got is the cross bur- said it looked like a set of suspenders.  He said, "But the reason I didn't put the Christian cross on the flag is because I didn't wanna antagonize the Southern Jews, that's why I used the St. Andrew's Cross of Scotland," he said, "but those stars represent the states that withdrew from the Union," he said.  And it means, like three words, I can tell you what those three words are, that's what it means, slavery, slavery, slavery.  That's all documented, see and I have all this and I'll show you my room when I go back, I got a file cabinet and I got boxes and boxes, what, but most of my stuff is back in Georgia, you know.
Speaker 1: Lanier Phillips [HistoryMaker Lanier W. Phillips]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --thank you so much for sharing your story.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.

Speaker 1: Who's in this picture?
Speaker 2: Oh this is the graduating class of cooks and stewards school in San Diego [California], in December, 1943.  I would like to point out some things on this picture, if you notice that all the Filipinos and African Americans with the uniforms, that with the cap, has on bow ties and you notice the officers and the chief sitting in the chairs had string ties.  Well, the Filipinos and blacks weren't allowed to wear string ties, and if you notice that, on the left arm of the chief there, you notice the eagle and the rating badges and what, blacks and Filipinos, the mess attendants weren't allowed to put a crow in the ship lines, they put a crescent and a one inch horizontal mark if you were third class, and if you were second class, they put two one inch marks and first class, three.  There was no such thing as a African Americans making chief, no such thing as chief mess attendant, and I was in that graduating class and I made third class, that was December '43 [1943], and after we graduated, they headed toward the Pacific and I spent the rest of the time '44 [1944], and '45 [1945], and came back to states, the war [World War II, WWII] ended on my way back to the states.
Speaker 1: Very good.  Take this?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh and you are in the top right, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's me.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on a second, still didn't get it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay who's this?
Speaker 1: Yes.  That's, after I finished boot camp, 1941, if you'll notice, on my, well it's showing my right sleeve there, there's one little white mark on?  Well the white sailors have three, that means I'm third class mess attendant, and I get if I'm second class, three if I'm first class mess attendant, but I could never wear the white stripe around my shoulder like the white sailors, so that's another difference.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Ready, sir.  Okay go ahead and tell us about it.
Speaker 1: This picture here is the other three, it was four African Americans and one Filipino on board the Truxtun [USS Truxtun (DD-229)] when we lost it, they all lost their lives.  The first one here with the cap and the crescent and the one inch horizontal mark, Henry Langston, he's from Truxtun, Virginia [Truxun, Portsmouth, Virginia], right outside of Portsmouth, Virginia and the next one is Houston [Earl Houston], he's from New York, and the next one is Turner, he's from, Billy Gene Turner, he's from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, they all lost their life, maybe one of the reasons they, they froze to death is because they was afraid to go ashore thinking that it was Iceland, but, but, you see my campaign ribbon said I got thirteen campaign rib-
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Even without it, it's hard to, to do.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Other side, (unclear) new piece helping you.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay this particular picture here is--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh, I almost got you recorded.  Sir can you tell us that again?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: This picture is we went back for a reunion in St. Lawrence, Newfoundland [Canada], and we went down, that's Bergeron [Edward Bergeron] next to me there, he's the one that climbed the cliff and he's the one that went over the ice cap to the mine, the Iron Springs Mine [St. Lawrence, Canada], and alerted the people that there was a [U.S.] Navy war- U.S. warship sinking, and they came with their ropes and blankets and all and scaled down those cliffs you see in it and came down and rescued forty-five others.  So forty-
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: This is a recent photograph, I went to my great-grandmother's [sic. paternal grandmother, Adeline Phillips], if you notice at the bottom of the stone there, she was born in 1852, and she used to sit me as child on the floor and tell me all about slavery and she would explain everything about it and what her childhood was like.
Speaker 1: Oh, they invited a group of residents from the Armed Forces Retirement Home to come over and that's the general at the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.], one of the big wheels you might say and I was talking to him, telling him he wanted to know when I joined the Navy and what I did in the Navy and things like that.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Do you know his name?
Speaker 1: I don't have his name, no, I don't have it, I may have it written down somewhere.
Speaker 2: I was telling him about the Navy and about the mess attendants in the Navy and about the racism and discrimination, how far we've come or what.  And he knew Admiral Williams [Melvin G. Williams, Jr.], or what and--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is a Newfoundland dog.  They said this dog has webbed feet like a duck, one of these great swimmers, and they rescue many fishermen, if the boat turns over or something, he'd swim out and get 'em and pull 'em ashore, he's very strong dogs.  Ah, '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: Son's children, so these are my--my grandson's children, these are my great-granddaughters, two daughters.
