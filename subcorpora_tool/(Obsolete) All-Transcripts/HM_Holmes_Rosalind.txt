Speaker 1: Okay, now tell us, what do you know about your mother's side of the family? How far back can you trace the ancestors on this side? Are there any stories that go all the way back to Africa or slavery or Reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: No, only way I, I can go back is my mother's parents, my mother's mother who lived, also lived in Laurel, Mississippi. I didn't spend much time or get a chance to really know her because she passed away. And then there was my grandfather, which moved up to Detroit [Michigan], which I got a lot of time, to spend time with my grandfather because we would usually go visit, you know, every weekend or something like that and spend a lot of time with him. His name was Joseph Buckley.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Grandmother's name was, oh gosh, I think it was Marie, Marie Buckley [sic. Crizel Buckley].
Speaker 1: Okay, and your grandfather moved to Detroit at some point, okay, okay. Well, what--are there any stories about what the family did in Laurel, Mississippi for a living? Were they, were they doing farm work or were they doing other kinds of work?
Speaker 2: I, they were cotton pickers.
Speaker 1: Okay. Were they sharecroppers? Did they own land?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Now was your mother, was she raised in Laurel all the way?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was raised in, born and raised in Laurel and she was in Laurel until, she attended college in Laurel.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know which school she went to?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did she finish school?
Speaker 2: Yes, she graduated.
Speaker 1: And what did she do after she graduated?
Speaker 2: After she graduated, she got married and then that's when she moved to Detroit. She met her husband and got married and moved to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Now was she trained as a teacher or--I know that was so common in those days, everybody'll be trained as a teacher but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think my, she did teach for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know where she taught but--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, so what were you thinking, about 1930, early 1930 she was, she moved to Detroit?
Speaker 2: She--it was the early '40s [1940s], I believe (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Early '40s [1940s], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, around about the early '40s [1940s].
Story_ID: 623726
Speaker 1: Now did she [Ashford Holmes' mother, Mary Buckley Ashford] have any stories about growing up in Laurel [Mississippi], about what it was like to grow up there and, and, you know, what the family, you know, what kind of family situation they had in Laurel?
Speaker 2: I, I really don't recall. I know she, she, they, they, there was a big family because she had three brothers and three sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay, so six children, okay. That probably wasn't considered a big family in--down south (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then, no, not--
Speaker 1: --that's a regular size, you know.
Speaker 2: Probably so, um-hm, yeah, and I think they, they all moved to Detroit [Michigan]. All of them were in, one moved to Ohio, the rest--one of the brothers moved to Ohio and the rest they came, all of them moved up to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Now did they all come at once or did they kind of, one come up and then bring the other one up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I believe, my grandfather [Joseph Buckley], he moved the whole family, they all just decided, he decided that he wanted to move them all to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Now did they, they like Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I don't know. She never, you know, I really never really asked my mom about that.
Speaker 1: Did she talk like she wanted to go back there one day?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh, she never mentioned that, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Well some of these questions may seem like I'm asking--some of this should be obvious to anybody that, you may not want to go back to Mississippi in 1940 but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I'm just trying to, you know, I'm asking it 'cause it's history--
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and if there's a reason why they didn't want to go back or something, you know, it's a good time to tell it, if there's a story about why they didn't want to go back, why they wanted to get out of there, you know, but I think most people have a general sense that it wasn't the best place for black people in those days but, at any rate, but they, by the early '40s [1940s], they were all in Detroit?
Speaker 2: They--yeah, they were all in Detroit (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right. All right, now did your mother teach any in Detroit?

Speaker 1: Ashford, you know who I'm thinking about when I heard John Lee.
Speaker 2: John Lee, um-hm (laughter).
Speaker 1: I think about John Lee Hooker (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know where you're going.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, he's, being a famous Detroit [Michigan] blues musician.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the kids used to tease us because my mom's name was Mary [Mary Buckley Ashford] and his name was John so they, that song, 'Good Golly Miss' --it's, no, a song named, 'Mary' [ph.], Beckett and Elliot [ph.] song, 'Along Came Johnny' [ph.], it had something that they used to tease us all the time about that.

Speaker 2: Well my father's side of the family, we spent more time with them. My grandmother's Nancy Ashford and my grandfather's name was Ervin, E-R-V-I-N, Ashford [Ervin Ashford].
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: And, well at the time, I don't, I don't know exactly what they were doing--at the time when we started spending time they weren't, they were, well I guess retired or whatever because they were living down, I can't, I cannot remember the name of the street, but it was right next to a graveyard down near off of Jefferson [Avenue]. They've torn all that out now but most weekends we would go--
Speaker 1: Here in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know I didn't mention my mom's father, we spent time with him, also, because he was in Detroit.
Speaker 1: That's Joseph Buckley?
Speaker 2: Jo- Joseph, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you mentioned that--
Speaker 2: Oh, I did, okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah. Did he work for one of the auto plants here or something or--
Speaker 2: No, my father did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He worked.
Speaker 1: But your grandfather didn't?
Speaker 2: But no, not my grandfather.
Speaker 1: All right, so, so your grandmother and grandfather on your father's side lived here in De- so they, did they move the whole family to Detroit too?
Speaker 2: They did move his family too but I don't know exactly when they moved to Detroit but, yeah, they moved, it's, he, he brought his family 'cause that's when he met my mother, they met.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did your father have a chance to go to school too?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I don't know where he went.
Speaker 1: Did he go to high school or college?
Speaker 2: I'm quite sure he went to high school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's probably in Alabama you think, maybe?
Speaker 2: Would be 'cause I think it was later on when they moved to--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right. So, when he came to De- Detroit, I take it he was a teenager then or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --or a (unclear) teenager (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I assume he had to be a teenager.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a--but he did work for the auto industry?
Speaker 2: One of the company--the car companies, I think it was Ford [Ford Motor Company].
Story_ID: 623728
Speaker 1: Now is there a, was he [Ashford Holmes' father, John Ashford, Sr.] working with--for Ford [Ford Motor Company] when he met your mother [Mary Buckley Ashford]?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, no, unh-uh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, well is there a story about how they met? Did they tell a story about how they--
Speaker 2: Do you know, I actually never found out that. I--they never really ever told me how they met. My mom was kind of like a private person, you know, we, like I ask her even with her age, she just, she wouldn't even tell us her age, so we had to find out how old she was (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well those are the days when children, you know, kind of weren't encouraged to ask questions about, a lot like that.
Speaker 2: Right, we never thought about asking, unh-uh, no, and it's at, it's just been recently that we actually found out my mom's real age.
Speaker 1: Okay, there's no story that leaked out about how they met or came together or became attracted to one another or--
Speaker 2: Not that I can remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they did meet here in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they got married in the early '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, yeah, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you know the year they got married?
Speaker 2: Oh, no I don't and that was, I should have checked, I could have checked that out.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you were born in forty--did they, did they get married--
Speaker 2: They, they had to be somewhere in '42 [1942], '41 [1941], my sister was born the year before, maybe the- they might have been a little before the '40s [1940s] that they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe 1939?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--maybe around about that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have one brother and one sister.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Brother's name is John Lee Ashford, Jr. [John Ashford, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, and your sister?
Speaker 2: Geraldine [Geraldine Ashford Biffle].
Speaker 1: Is that with a G?
Speaker 2: G-E-R-A-L-D-I-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And her maiden name, she was a Ashford but she's married twice so she's a Biffle and a Faulkner [ph.], she has two last names.
Story_ID: 623729
Speaker 1: Returning to your parents, when you think about their personalities and their talents and their general dispositions, who do you think that you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mom [Mary Buckley Ashford].
Speaker 1: Okay, wh- why?
Speaker 2: Because she's, well, I'm, I'm not as outspoken as my mom but, I know she used to dance all the time, and I think I kind of got that after her and she used to sing a lot. So, I think my little singing abilities come from my mom, but it's just, I think I was just more close, closer to my mom than, than I was with my father [John Ashford, Sr.]. He was more, I guess he wanted, wanted a boy first but he had the girls before he had the boy [John Ashford, Jr.].
Story_ID: 623730
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think my earliest childhood memory was when I first started school, grade sc- not grade school--
Speaker 1: At, what was the name of it?
Speaker 2: I went to St. George--
Speaker 1: St., okay.
Speaker 2: --Catholic school [St. George School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: This is on the north side of Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: No, this was sort of like on the east side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was east side.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's where the family was at first. You were telling me you think before we started that you all lived on the east side first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, sort of east.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so, school is your first memory.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, was my first 'cause I, it was just, I was just anxious and ready to go to school and it, it was just something that I was really, you know, wanted to do. I was really ready.
Story_ID: 623731
Speaker 1: Now can you describe, now you all lived on the east side until you were about how old?
Speaker 2: We were young because I think I started St. George [St. George School, Detroit, Michigan], it might have been, maybe about six or seven I might, maybe, around six or seven.
Speaker 1: Okay, then you moved to, like, north Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: What, yeah. We moved to the North End of Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay, we call it the North End, okay, all right. I won't get it wrong. Actually, I don't know Detroit so you have to tell (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was (laughter)--it was the North End of Detroit.
Speaker 1: The North End, okay.
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: And what street did you all live on?
Speaker 2: We were on a street called Delmar.
Speaker 1: To Delmar, I've heard of Delmar, yeah, Delmar, Delmar Street, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: My aunt had purchased a four family flat over there and we moved into one of the flats.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was, was there like a, now, well into Detroit as we speak, there are a lot of empty houses, a lot of vacant lots where houses used to be. Was it like that in those days?
Speaker 2: Not then, no, unh-uh. Every house was full, every block, you know, there're kids all over the block.
Speaker 1: That's what I would think, yeah, so, 'cause this was a boomtown in a lot of ways, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, can you describe for us some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Some of the sights, well--smells, I can't remember any familiar smells, just, no. The sights was basically my neighborhood because that's where mostly I spent my time. We went, when I went to school, I went to school two blocks from where I lived, so I walked to school and I was allowed to go from one corner to the other corner when I was young and, or stay out in front of the house. So we didn't really do too many, too much traveling or get into too many sights except maybe when school, if we did, like a school trip or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is on both sides of town or, or--
Speaker 2: On, on the North End because that's basically where I grew up, on the North End.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So you didn't, so you all just basically stayed on the block?
Speaker 2: That's, that's it.
Speaker 1: So, what did the block look like?
Speaker 2: Our block was nice. I mean, we had fun because we, every--there was basically children in every house, every other house somebody had children and we, we just had fun. We socialized together and we played together and we'd go out and spend time, but we were always in front of the house and we had a certain time that we had to be in the house. My mama [Mary Buckley Ashford] always had this thing, when the streetlights come on, you're supposed to hit the door, so that's basically what we did, we hit the door when the streetlights come on.
Speaker 1: Okay, but this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But then--
Speaker 1: --this was all year around or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, during the summer when we were out, yeah.
Speaker 1: In the summer, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Ever since, well, winter, we'd be out too 'cause we, but still, we'd be in the neighborhood. We never went out that neighborhood, unh-uh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay. So were there, did the neighborhoods have, well, was there a special name for the neighborhood that you lived in?
Speaker 2: No, not--
Speaker 1: Just the north, North End?
Speaker 2: --it's just basically North End.
Speaker 1: North End, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, North End which, and the neighbors were the type of neighbors that you would, could not do anything wrong 'cause if you did, they would chastise you. They had the right to chastise you and what we used to do is, my aunt lived on the front of the house, we lived in the back, so we would tell my mom we're going downstairs to my aunt's and we'd sneak off the front porch, but if the neighbors caught us, then we'd have to sneak back in the porch to get in the house but they knew we weren't supposed to be out but, we had, we had a very close knit, tight neighborhood.
Story_ID: 623732
Speaker 1: Any other, what about sounds? Any sounds of the neighborhood [North End, Detroit, Michigan] that you remember?
Speaker 2: No, basically just the kids out playing, streetcars running up and down the street.
Speaker 1: Okay, no, no music or anything in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Not really in the neighborhood, now in the homes we did, but it wasn't like where you'd walk down the street you'd hear music blasting, you know, all up and down, but basically you could go in your house and you can always, especially my house, 'cause that's where most of us spent time playing, playing our music and wearing holes in my mother's [Mary Buckley Ashford] carpet, dancing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you'd turn the radio on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We--oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: We'd go in the house and do that. We didn't do that outside.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite radio station?
Speaker 2: A favorite radio station?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Do you mean from, of now?
Speaker 1: No, then.
Speaker 2: Or then?
Speaker 1: I'm talking about then, yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't really know what radio stations--'cause most of the time we didn't listen to the radio, we would just, we had a little Victrola where we would play little 45s [45 rpm record]. My mom--not the 45s, they had the 78s [78 rpm record] then and my dad [John Ashford, Sr.] used to always buy, every week he would go buy a 78 and most of the time when we played, we'd play the record player, play the songs on the record player (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right, 'cause the stations in those days, I guess, they were--
Speaker 2: They didn't have very many stations 'cause I can't recall, I don't even remember listening to the radio. I know I watched TV, 'cause we had one of the TVs where you had to put the, to make it color, you put the little color sheet over the TV, then you'd have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, like a sheet of mylar--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --blue, green or red--
Speaker 2: Right, right, and you'd have color TV. So that was mostly what we did all the time. We didn't, we didn't listen to radio too much then, not, not when I was growing up, that came much later.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So there wasn't a station that appealed to black folks on the radio for the most part? Was that part of the--
Speaker 2: We did have, come to think of it, well I think that was a, that was around about the time we did have a, it was WCHB [sic. WJLB Radio, Detroit, Michigan], I think it was, disc jockey, yes, Frantic, Frantic, Frantic Ernie, Ernie Durham, Frantic Ernie, that's what we'd call him.
Speaker 1: Frantic Ernie?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And those were the days when we got a little older and we were able to get away from home.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but, but mostly records, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, most of the time we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have like a--
Speaker 2: --play records.
Speaker 1: --so did you, you pretty much listened to what your parents listened to?
Speaker 2: Well, because they bought 'em, yeah, so we had to listen to them, but they bought a lot of the stuff that, you know, appealed to us. I remember, I'll never forget this record, my dad bought it, it was called, 'Splish Splash.' I can't remember, Bobby--I don't know if it was Bobby Darin or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bobby--Bobby something, yeah, it may have been, "Splish splash, I was taking a bath."
Speaker 2: Yeah, when he brought that, I was so excited, I just fell in love with that song.
Story_ID: 623733
Speaker 1: 'Cause you, you lived during really the, you were coming up during the transition from band music, I guess, a lot of band music to rock and roll music sort of, or jazz to more rhythm and blues type, I think there was, would you say that's true (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sort of, yeah, sort of.
Speaker 1: It was kind of a, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Let's see, there was a time when you, people like--who were some of the people that your father [John Ashford, Sr.] liked? I mean, I'm just thinking maybe Dinah Washington, [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Price, I don't know what--
Speaker 2: He basically, that was it, Dinah Washington, Etta James, yeah, Lloyd Price and, who was that jazz singer? I can't think of her name now and it's right on the tip of my tongue.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson or, no she was later, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.
Speaker 1: Ella Fitzgerald?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ella Fitzgerald and there was another one.
Speaker 1: Sarah Vaughan?
Speaker 2: Sarah Vaughan, and this--she was married to, was it Coltrane [John Coltrane] or somebody that she, this, before he was married to?
Speaker 1: I just, I mean Hazel Scott--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --who was married to Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] or--
Speaker 2: No, oh man, how can I not see it--
Speaker 1: The one who's, Alice Coltrane, I think, I only know about that one. I think he had another wife before.
Speaker 2: It might have not been him but she was married to somebody famous and her name's right on the tip of my tongue but I can't think of it but that was basically, you know, his era, what he'd listen to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --what he would go buy.
Speaker 1: All right, so, remember not in, when you were in high school [Wilbur Wright High School, Detroit, Michigan] like Elvis Presley became big and Chuck Berry and all that group, or what they call rock and roll, started.
Speaker 2: Basically, when I was in high school, high school was '61 [1961], '58 [1958], yeah, basically.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '57 [1957], '56 [1956], '57 [1957] was the era when Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry and those guys started.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, yup.
Speaker 1: Well, from maybe '54 [1954], actually, on up to, through that period.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I remember there was a time when music had changed on some level, you know, but, so when did you start buying records yourself?
Speaker 2: I start--I didn't really start buying records 'til I was, in high school, right about the time, about a year when I started high school because that's when I had to buy my own, 'cause I had a little coop job. I'd go to school two weeks and I'd work two weeks. So then if I wanted my records, I could go out and buy 'em, then they had the 45s [45 rpm record], they switched from the big LPs to the 45s. So that's when I started buying mine, around about '59 [1959], '58 [1958], right after I started high school.

Speaker 1: Well, when you were a little kid, when you were a little kid growing up, did you ever think about singing?
Speaker 2: Never thought about it, never. That was the furthest thing from my mind. I didn't even, like I said, even singing was like, it just wasn't, I just liked listening to the music. I never, ever thought about being a singer, unh-uh. My goal was to be an airline stewardess, that's what I've always thought about being. When I grow up, I want to be an airline stewardess.
Speaker 1: Now where did you get that idea first? Was, I mean, how did you get that, the idea that you wanted to be an airline stewardess?
Speaker 2: It was just something that I liked, that I thought I would like doing and, and, you know, seeing maybe, I don't know if it was from watching movies or something or seeing an airline stewardess, because I had never flown then so I really didn't actually know what they do or anything, but just for some reason that was my, my goal. When I grow up, that's what I want to be, an airline stewardess.

Speaker 1: What school did you go to on the North End [Detroit, Michigan], grade school?
Speaker 2: Grade school, I went to, okay, I went to St. George [St. George School] when we moved to North End, and that was like up until sixth grade, I think it was, then they closed the school, so I had one more year so I went to Hutchins junior high [Harry B. Hutchins Intermediate School, Detroit, Michigan] for that last year.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was on the east side too, right?
Speaker 2: Sort of, basically, that was mid-west, west, yeah, sort of, in between. It's on Woodrow Wilson [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay, and then, now did you have a favorite teacher in grade school or middle school, or junior high?
Speaker 2: Yes. In grade school, I think my favorite teacher was, her name was Ms. Parker [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, why was she your favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: What did she, she was my English teacher I think it was and it was just, just I liked English and that was just one of my favorite classes and I just liked Ms. Parker.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So, were you involved in, you know, any of the, any class activities in, in grade school or high, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not in grade school. I, when I went to grade school, I was sort of like, I had been in Catholic school for six years and kind of, it was a big change when I went to grade school. I was sort of like maybe you call a wall- wallflower, wallflower. I was more so quiet and just more to myself because I guess I was just trying to adjust to being in a public school, 'cause it was so different from being in Catholic school. So I was really quiet and laid back. I even had trouble, when I first went, in grade school. In St. George, we wore uniforms, we always wore the blue skirts and the white tops and when I went to junior high that last year, I didn't even know how to dress. I would go to school with stripes and plaids on, so the kids would (laughter) kind of laugh at me. So somebody had to tell me, you can't match--I wasn't really good on matching up colors but, that was the funniest thing that happened to me when I was in Hutchins.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you went to Wilbur Wright High--
Speaker 2: Wilbur Wright High School [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's on the North End, right? Now is there anything--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --significant about Wilbur Wright we need to know? I mean, what kind of high school was that considered to be?
Speaker 2: Wilbur Wright was a vocational school, it was all-boys vocational school and a lot of the subjects were, 'cause they had one subject, shop, where the boys would work on cars and things like that, and like the vocational school was sort of like to prepare you for going out, jobs, finding jobs because they would train you. They had like a nursing, this was after, the first year, it was all-boys and then I think in '67 [sic. 1957], they turned it around and they let girls attend. So then they also, they had nursing classes, they had business classes and shop, they didn't let the girls do shop. A lot of the girls wanted to do shop, but that first year they wouldn't let them do shop. I didn't go until '68 [1968], the second year, that's when I went to Wilbur Wright and I really wanted to go--
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958], '58 [1958], right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifty-eight [1958], did I say--
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '58 [1958]. I really didn't want to go there, but my mom [Mary Buckley Ashford] forced me to go because she sent my sister [Geraldine Ashford Biffle] there. My sister was the first one that went when they first converted it to girls so she made me go there because my sister went there and I took a business course, I took business and had the opportunity to, we'd, we'd go to school two weeks and then we worked two weeks and the only thing I hated about that, we had to go to school 'til July. We didn't get out of school 'til July because of the co-op, because it was a co-op, so in order to get your, amount of hours in you had to go to school a little longer. So, I took, they had business classes, retailing, they had all different kind of courses that you can take and I think I majored in business and in retailing.
Story_ID: 623736
Speaker 1: And I had a favorite teacher there [Wilbur Wright High School, Detroit, Michigan]. Now that's when I got into singing. I joined a mix choir and the glee club.
Speaker 2: Well, who was your favorite teacher?
Speaker 1: Mr.--his name was Mr. Tatum, James Tatum.
Speaker 2: Now did he have anything to do with singing?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was my music teacher.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And today he's a jazz musician. He still performs with a jazz group.
Speaker 2: Now is he any relationship to Art Tatum--
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: --the great piano player out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: I don't think so, I'm not sure, it might be, but I've never heard him mention.
Speaker 2: Okay, probably would have said something I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: James Tatum. What does he play?
Speaker 1: Piano.
Speaker 2: Piano player, too?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter), all right. Okay, so you took music courses and you started, what, now did you, did you have a pretty good voice in high school you think or did they think, you know--
Speaker 1: Everybody--they thought I was pretty good. I was, and he, he put me in all the classes, the music mixed choir, glee club and just choir.
Speaker 2: Okay, did you have a special, what, I guess range would you sing?
Speaker 1: I was soprano.
Speaker 2: Okay, soprano.
Speaker 1: First soprano.
Speaker 2: First soprano, okay. So did you have a favorite piece that you performed in the, well this is the glee club or the choir or--
Speaker 1: There--we had several. We had a glee club and we had mixed choir and, no, unh-uh, I didn't have anything special that I liked.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were in a glee club and the choir?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, both, okay, both of them, all right, all right. Did he let you sing solos and--
Speaker 1: No, I never did solo, unh-uh. That's one thing, I can sing, I can harmonize but I am not a lead singer and I, I never, I don't know why I never even thought about it, but it's just something I didn't want to do. I liked to harmonize. I like the harmony.
Story_ID: 623737
Speaker 1: I always was curious, you know, when you see groups as to why one person is singing the lead all the time and the rest of them are singing in the background. And, you know, there were some groups where there'd be different leads, I mean, The Temptations, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, you had--
Speaker 1: --they had Eddie Kendricks could lead or David Ruffin--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or sometime Otis [HistoryMaker Otis Clayborn Williams] and somebody else might lead a song, or Melvin [Melvin Franklin] even led a song once, but it seemed like most groups had one person only doing that. Is that, is there a, what is the philosophy behind that, is that--
Speaker 2: Well, it's just, I guess it's just basically because when you start a group you just have some that don't do lead, that are just, you know, can do background vocals and can do the harmony and they just never did lead or even wanted to lead, because with the group that I'm in, when we perform in our group, first of all, it was Del-Phis [The Del-Phis] and that was at the time that I was in high school [Wilbur Wright High School, Detroit, Michigan], that's when we started, basically started the group. We had two lead singers and what, the way that happened was, well the first lead singer, when, when Mr. Larkins auditioned us, he wanted a group together, so he already had the lead singer so he was just trying to get his background group together.
Speaker 1: Okay now, explain who Mr. Larkins is?
Speaker 2: Mr. Larkins is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is a--
Speaker 2: His name is Edward Larkins.
Speaker 1: They called him Pops?
Speaker 2: Pops, yeah, that was his nickname, Pops.
Speaker 1: Now did he work at the local YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] or did he--
Speaker 2: No, he just, he was just a guy that had a couple of groups that he had put together and while he was forming these groups--actually the way I got to, to become a member of the group was, my mother [Mary Buckley Ashford] had, saw this ad, my sister [Geraldine Ashford Biffle] was singing, she sung with two guys. And my mother saw this ad where this guy was trying to find some singers so she contacted him and sent my sister down to audition and he auditioned my sister and the two guys that was in her group, and then he had mentioned the fact that he wanted to form, he had a guys group already, of five guys. As a matter of fact, one of the guys in the group name was Joe Pep [Joe Pep Harris], he was, he sang with the Undisputed Truth. So he had this group and he decided he wanted to form a girls group and the lead singer then was Gloria Jean Williams [Gloria Williams]. She kind of helped him out with the group. So he already had her as the lead singer so when my mom went down and my sister, they kind of informed him that she had a sister that sings and the next thing I know, my mom was telling me I needed to go down here, go down here for this audition which, like I said, that was the furthest thing from my mind and I told her, "I don't want to go to an audition."
Speaker 1: So you never thought about becoming a professional singer or making any money singing at all?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, I never thought about it, unh-uh--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'til she forced me to go. She said, "You're going" (laughter). So, that was it. When I went and I auditioned and sung a few notes and the guy said, "Okay."
Speaker 1: So just like that?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that's it, I said, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now this was at the Y and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so, he had organized a group, though, to go to perform at different venues and, for cash, or what?
Speaker 2: They, I think they were, the guys he had already, I think they were doing, you know, things here and there and maybe little things at the Y and stuff like that, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: So they would get paid for, for what they did?
Speaker 2: I don't know if they ever got paid or not, I don't know, 'cause we actually, well this was after we got with him and we had worked with him for a while. We didn't really do too many shows. We did little sock hops and stuff like that and we never got paid, and we actually didn't until we changed management. We, we, kind of went with another guy, his name was Fred Brown, and he was a mailman. So, he had a couple of groups. I think he had the guy named J.J. Barnes and this is leading into how we got to Chess Record--to, to perform, to make that recording with Chess Records because we kind of left Mr. Larkins and we started with Mr. Brown.
Speaker 1: Mr. Brown, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 623738
Speaker 1: So you left M- Larkin [sic. Edward Larkins] and, about what year was this?
Speaker 2: Oh goodness, wait a, I can't even, what year that was.
Speaker 1: Now you all got together, let me go backtrack and say now you got together, Mr. Larkin, Pops Larkin got you all together as a singing group about, in what year? How old were you in high school [Wilbur Wright High School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I was still in high school so I had to be about fifteen, sixteen, yeah, around in there.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you took up with the, the, Mr. Brown [Fred Brown]--
Speaker 2: Mr. Brown (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) he became your manager, the head of the group [The Del-Phis] and he got you a deal with Chess Records?
Speaker 2: With Chess Records, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you still in high school?
Speaker 2: He, yeah, we were still in high school 'cause we went to Chicago [Illinois] and recorded that, and I say at the time, he had another performer, and his name was J.J. Barnes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the reason that we went to Chicago was in order to do a backing up for J.J. Barnes. And in some kind of way, I don't know how that answer came in, it was an answer he did, a song called 'Won't You Let Me Know' and we did an answer to his 'Won't You Let Me Know' called, 'I'll Let You Know.' So that's when, we also went to Chicago and did both those recordings in Chicago with Mr. Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay, and J.J. Barnes, he's famous for something. I'm trying to think of his song. He, sung--
Speaker 2: He--I can't think, he has a few songs.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know what it's about, I know what it is. I can think, I can hear it. (Singing) "Do (scats), you don't know, (scats) like I know, (scats)." I don't know, I'm probably messing up this whole recording by doing it but this is, (singing) "You don't know (scats)," that was J.J. Barnes.
Speaker 2: That, that--okay.
Speaker 1: I was doing the boogaloo to that.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: (Scats) Yeah, I remember J.J. Barnes
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, you're talking about another J.J. Barnes [sic. J.J. Jackson].
Speaker 1: Another J.J. Barnes (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know who you're talking about now.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's a different one?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But the same name?
Speaker 2: (Singing) "It's all right, yeah girl, it's all right" ['But It's Alright'] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Singing) "It's all right, all right, girl," right, "it's all right."
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that's another J.J. Barnes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: This one he's, he was a local from Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And he has a sister, I don't know if you're familiar with, Ortheia Barnes [Ortheia Barnes Kennerly].
Speaker 1: No, I'm not.
Speaker 2: But he, yeah, he made that recording called 'Won't You Let Me Know.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we did like an answer, that's when Gloria Williamson [Gloria Williams] was with us. So it was four of us. It was Gloria, Martha [HistoryMaker Martha Reeves], Annette [Annette Beard], myself and that's when we did the answer to his 'Won't You Let Me Know,' and we were still in high school then, yeah, still in high school, Annette and I were still in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you put a record out, I mean, did, what happened when the record was, was printed? Did you get a stack of them or anything or, did you, what happened?
Speaker 2: No, we, I think we got one copy of that. We didn't get a stack of 'em, we just got one copy and the record really didn't, didn't sell, it didn't go anywhere, it just didn't have enough, you know--well the guy that managed us was just a postman and he didn't have much backing, we didn't have much backing, so it didn't go that far.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, all right, but you never heard it on the radio or anything?
Speaker 2: I think they did, it did get a little bit of airplay, um-hm, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Now was that a big deal around your house? Were people excited that you had a record?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well now now--that one wasn't such a big deal 'cause you really didn't hear it that much but now when I first released, once we went to Motown [Motown Records] and our first release came out, then that was exciting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was really exciting.
Story_ID: 623739
Speaker 1: So, well what happened? Did you all just quit the contract or did Chess Records just tell you all not to, he didn't want to do any more songs or what?
Speaker 2: What happened? You know, I don't ever think we were under contract. I don't, I don't recall us ever signing anything, so we weren't committed to him. So, in the long run, Martha [HistoryMaker Martha Reeves] was, had started working at Motown [Motown Records] and they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now she's working as a secretary?
Speaker 2: She was a secretary, yeah, she worked as a secretary and they did, they were doing a recording and she just happened to call us one day and said, you know, "Why don't you girls, why don't you come down, you know, they're doing some background work, doing some recordings, so why don't you girls come on down and do some background work." So that's when we went down and we started doing background work. At that time, Gloria Jean [Gloria Williams] was still with the group [The Del-Phis] and Gloria was basically our lead singer, Martha was, and actually Martha came into our group after a couple of, we had five--there were, we started out with five girls and we lost a couple so Martha replaced one of the girls that we had lost. So, in the long run, she invited us down to Motown and that's how we started doing background 'cause our first background work was with Marvin Gaye.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have any idea who he was at that time?
Speaker 2: Who, who Marvin Gaye was?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he wasn't Marvin Gaye, yet, right?
Speaker 2: No, he was just, to us he was just Marvin Gaye, you know, and it was during the times that we were there, we would see him, you know, in and out and he'd play drums or he'd be in a session room or something, but we never really paid much attention to, to who Marvin Gaye was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was this nineteen sixty--1960 or so?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961], I think it was, '61 [1961] or '62 [1962]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause I think I just about graduating from high school [Wilbur Wright High School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Yeah, '62 [1962]--
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962]. Right, right. So you all were the background sing- now he had, he was a drummer, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: For the band, for the, I guess, were they called the band in The Funk Brothers? I know they--
Speaker 2: The Funk Brothers, yeah, that was the Motown's band, but I--
Speaker 1: Were they calling them that in those days or is this something recent?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that was with that, I think that's what they always called them but I don't think Marvin, Marvin wasn't even a part of them. It was just their odd thing. He was just a drummer and he'd just be around the studio, in the studio, playing drums all the time. So we had got this call, you know, to come down and sing some background, so he was the first person we started doing background with.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you all were background for 'Stubborn Kind of Fellow,' from what I understand, what I have written here, and 'Hitch Hike'?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: 'Pride and Joy.'
Speaker 1: Now those were big hits?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I think we did 'Pride and Joy.'
Speaker 1: 'Pride and Joy,' okay. So you all were the ones back there singing, (singing) "Pride and joy. Pride and Joy" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear), that's us, that's (laughter)--
Story_ID: 623740
Speaker 1: So this is, essentially, it's been said that a lot of the music that Marvin Gaye sung and the, the music that you all [Martha and The Vandellas] sang, sounded a lot like church music, that with the refrains and, you know, in fact, you know, and it had a lot of the gospel influence.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, it did have that, that sort of like a, like that gospel beat sort of like.
Speaker 1: Upbeat kind of a gospel beat to it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did, was church a big part of growing up for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, because, actually when I went to Catholic school [St. George School, Detroit, Michigan], we had to go to church every morning before we went to school.
Speaker 1: Now this is Catholic Mass, though, right, or Catholic--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, Catholic, so--
Speaker 1: Were there, you know, Latin and such--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was always in church 'cause I had to go before I started school, it was a must (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it wasn't the Catholic music that influenced you very much, was it?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, was your family Catholic basically?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't go to church where they did a lot of singing and--
Speaker 2: No, I never--I did when I, when I spent weekends with my aunt, because she was Baptist, I would have to go to church with her. So we did get a chance to go to a Baptist church.
Speaker 1: Is there a big difference in your aunt's church and the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, 'cause our church is more like a, quiet. They've changed a lot now, you know, in the years come, but it was more just, just like, you know, real laid back and quiet, but Baptist church I had an experience, it was a lot different.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the church that she attended?
Speaker 2: It was, I think it was Church of Our Father [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, Church of Our Father. Was that on the North End [Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: That was sort of like going east. It was down North End for a while and then I think they moved, yeah, they moved to the east side 'cause there's still, there is still a church on route 5 [M-5; Grand River Avenue], it's on east side.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So you got, so all right, so, so do you think that the church influenced your singing at all?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. I think what might have influenced was being in, just being in the mixed time when I went to high school [Wilbur Wright High School, Detroit, Michigan], 'cause like, you know, like I said, singing just wasn't the thing on my mind, it's on my--I'll just say, I was forced into it but I'm thankful that it happened that way because it, you know, meant a lot, it means a lot to me now.
Story_ID: 623741
Speaker 1: Now di- did you have a favorite singing group before you became like involved yourself?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I was always in love with, well I was in love with Frankie Lymon--
Speaker 1: Oh, Frankie--
Speaker 2: Of The Teenagers, but that was my group, Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers. I always had a crush on him.
Speaker 1: 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love.'
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you see the movie about Frankie Lymon ['Why Do Fools Fall in Love']?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I saw that movie (laughter), it's hilarious. That's another one where you got to use your imagination, you know, 'cause I said, "Did all this really happen?"
Speaker 1: I hear that, okay, so, yeah, Frankie Lymon, he was one of those early black performers of the early days of rock and roll, like Little Richard when he was out and Fats Domino and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --some of those. Did you listen to a lot, did you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, people always, I guess, have an idea that maybe performers will listen to, listen to each other a lot or influenced by each other a lot, I don't know, I mean--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: You didn't really think that that was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unh-uh.
Story_ID: 623742
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're singing back- backup with Marvin Gaye and these become hits. Now, was your family real excited when they, you know, they hear--these songs are on the radio a lot.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Stubborn Kind of Fellow,' 'Hitch Hike,' 'Pride and Joy,' they were on the radio a lot. You turn on the radio in the black community, you hear those songs.
Speaker 2: That's--yeah, that's all you do once you turn it on, you can hear 'em, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the records, you know, and everything and people playing those records over and over. Now did, how did your family feel about that?
Speaker 2: Well mom [Mary Buckley Ashford], my mom was very excited, you know, she was, she was very excited and pleased that she made me go in that direction.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a, did your, the financial compensation for that, you know, reach whatever expectations you had in your mind about what it might be? I mean, I don't know what you had thought. Had you ever thought about what a person making a record makes?
Speaker 2: No, you know, that was one thing too, I had gotten to a point where I wanted to sing and I never thought about anything else, the finance- financial part or anything of that, it never really--actually what I'm saying, I didn't think that I did this because of the money, you know, oh, that we're going to make big money. It never dawned on me that we would even, it would even happen like that, 'cause it was just that I wanted to sing and then once hearing yourself on a record, it was, it was just exciting, it was exciting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now did you--
Speaker 2: --'cause we were still young, you know, and I think we didn't look at that aspect, no, at that, at the present time.
Story_ID: 623743
Speaker 1: Now what were your impressions of Marvin Gaye when you heard him sing or met Marvin Gaye? What were--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I just fell in love with Marvin Gaye 'cause he was just so, he was good looking and just, just for him to talk to you was like, oh my god, I'm talking to Marvin Gaye (laughter), it was just like--
Speaker 1: I mean, even before became a star, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was just like, I still, I mean, even then when we started working with him, even on stage, we did a couple of things with him on stage, it's just like, oh man, we're in heaven right now 'cause we're singing with Marvin Gaye.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause he pretty soon was a pretty big star, fast, yeah, people knew who he was.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, really quick.
Speaker 2: And we were the first girls to actually go out with him because of, 'Stubborn Kind of Fellow.' They got, we had a chance to go out on the road because we did the background for him.
Speaker 1: Now where you still in high school [Wilbur Wright High School, Detroit, Michigan] when you went on the road?
Speaker 2: No, we, I was out, I had graduated then. We actually, we didn't start traveling 'til after got out of high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So what was that like? I mean, did, was it just Marvin Gaye or was there a group of Motown [Motown Records] performers that traveled?
Speaker 2: It was--the first thing, the first time we went out was the big Motown revue ['Motortown Revue'], that was, it consisted of Temptations [The Temptations], Marvin, The Contours, Supremes [The Supremes], us [The Del-Phis], Mary Wils- Mary Wells, so it was like a big--and we left on a big bus that day. I mean, that day we left it was really exciting 'cause we felt, oh, gee, we're going out on the road and we never, we had never been out of the state, out of the city, I mean, so it was like really exciting to us to know that we were going on the road and we were going all these different cities and just, just to perform.
Speaker 1: What was your, your feeling at the time? Did you have a feeling of how popular the Motown music was, you know, at the time that you left Detroit [Michigan]? I mean, I'm just wondering if, because you were doing this locally in Detroit, did you kind of not understand how big it was or, in the rest of the country?
Speaker 2: I didn't really understand how big it was until we started on the road, 'til we went on the road, then I realized and then especially once we got on the road to see the audience--that the people that we were performing for, you know, and the reactions, then that's when it really, my gosh, you know, it was like, I said, it's unbelievable.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember the first place that you all performed off the road?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the first city. It was, we had like a big, a whole long itinerary. We went to city, from city to city but--
Speaker 1: Were these all the biggest cities or what? How did, how were they determined?
Speaker 2: Well, we started out basically doing the South. We did quite a few one nighters, but basically they were all in the South, it started out in the South.
Speaker 1: For instance, where, whereabouts?
Speaker 2: Oh, we went to South Carolina, oh my god, it was so many that I can't even remember all of them, but at that time, it was, you know, that area, where prejudice was there. So most of the places that we performed were basically a white audience. The white audience were down here and the black audiences were up there, they were segregated, they kept them separate.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you actually performed in theaters where the black people had to sit in the balcony and the whites (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --sat on the floor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did the whole South tour, basically the whole South and this is what we experienced and--
Speaker 1: Were you ever in a situation where, I heard they sometimes they'd put a rope down the middle of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --if they didn't have a balcony they'd put a rope?
Speaker 2: To separate, yeah, they had the blacks on one side and the whites on the other side. And there's a story where Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] told 'em, just, you know, "Leave 'em alone," and he, he didn't like that idea and he had something to say about it, but the majority of the time we'd go and you'd have to look up and you see all of the blacks, you know, in the aud- upstairs and all the whites downstairs. Being, us being from the city, we never experienced that. It was like, to us, it was like, I don't believe it, you know, it's unbelievable but I am actually seeing this, I'm here, you know, and I am actually seeing what's going on and it was like, oh gosh, it was depressing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very depressing.
Story_ID: 623744
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me go back a little bit and ask you about, I think we, during the break, you were telling me that, that you used to go to some of the music venues in Detroit [Michigan], you know, in high school [Wilbur Wright High School, Detroit, Michigan] before you started singing yourself and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we used to spend a lot of time roller skating at the, at there, right down the street, Woodward Avenue, they had a, called the Arcadia [Arcadia Ballroom, Detroit, Michigan], and that's where we used to go roller skate and that was when I, at least I did get a chance to get away from home, I didn't have to stay on the block anymore (laughter), mom [Mary Buckley Ashford] let me go skating and even up at Northern, it used to be Northern Recreation Center, it's right next to Northern High School [Detroit, Michigan], we used to go there and do a lot of skating and swimming and we [The Del-Phis] also had a chance to perform at the, it was called the 20 Grand [Detroit, Michigan] then, which it's gone now, but a lot of the artists had a chance to perform down at the 20 Grand.
Speaker 1: So when you first started singing, you performed at the 20 Grand?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was even, I don't even think we had, we might have had one hit record or two but this was in the earlier part before we even started doing a lot of traveling. We did a lot of performing at the 20 Grand. That was, I think, sort of a place where they would kind of break you in, you know, you--
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you first started with Marvin Gaye, as back up, you were singing at the 20 Grand?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, around about that time we, we'd do things at the 20 Grand.
Speaker 1: In '61 [1961], 1961?
Speaker 2: About '61 [1961], '62 [1962], um-hm.
Story_ID: 623745
Speaker 1: Well, we were talking, we left off on the road, I think you were on the, or around you said you went to the South--
Speaker 2: To the South (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and you experienced segregation that you had seen on television but you didn't, had never really experienced?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, never thought it was that bad and never had the faintest idea that, but we were, you know, going to run into--and then they always thought that, like they thought we were Freedom Riders. We had our big Motown [Motown Records] sign on the bus says Motown revue ['Motortown Revue'] but people thought we were Freedom Riders, you know, and we went through a lot of bad experiences. We, one year, one day we got, we were getting on the bus and we got shot at the bus and, by the time we got to the next venue, everybody looked in the front of the bus and there's a couple of bullet holes in front of the bus where somebody had thought we were Freedom Riders, wanted us to get out of town. So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the age of the Freedom Riders, '61 [1961] they were coming out of Nashville [Tennessee], out of Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], going south in the buses, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. There was, it was quite an experience for us all. Like I say, seeing that we had never, you know, experienced that or never seen that actually happen, but it was true to life.
Speaker 1: Did it kind of, kind of cause you to pay more attention to the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, um-hm, much, much more aware. It was very scary.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where did you stay on the road when you were in the South?
Speaker 2: Well that was the thing, too. They had to pick and choose hotels, you know, we had to stay mostly at the black hotels. We, we, they, they set up a whole itinerary before you left to go on the road, so you knew exactly where we were going but most of 'em were the black, oh we definitely couldn't stay in the white hotels and we had to, to eat, we had to send the bus driver in to get food to bring out because we couldn't go into the restaurants and everything. And one experience that I had that really frightened me was I think everybody had practically got off the bus and I had just woke up and I saw, oh everybody's gone off the bus and went to the restaurant to eat, and I walked in the front door and there were like, I didn't see anybody, I didn't know where they were, where's everybody, you know, and I just saw the backs of a couple of people in the restaurant and then I just, it--thought, when I looked over to the side, I could see everybody, they had like a little side window where all of us could go and order, so I definitely backed up and went 'cause I didn't think, yeah, that's what I'm saying, not, not knowing about being in the South, it never dawned on me, oh, you can't do that, you know, you can't just walk in the front door like that, so it was an experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know where that was?
Speaker 2: I can't remember where that was, that was so long ago but I do remember it happening.
Speaker 1: Okay, but were you received pretty well by the, so white audiences came out to--
Speaker 2: Now that was, that was the thing, it was fantastic. They, I mean, they just, they had a good time, everybody had a time. The white audiences received us very well. We were very well accepted, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's, that's interesting that that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah it was, it really was.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think that was kind of crazy in some ways?
Speaker 2: I did, I said, and like you said, just to be there and just see, is this really happening? Am, you know, am I sleeping or is this real but it was real, it was real.
Speaker 1: So, you're getting this warm reception while the black people in town are completely segregated.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, and, but everybody's having a good time, you know, that was the thing. Everybody was having a good time.
Story_ID: 623746
Speaker 1: Who do you think, when you, when you went on the road, what was the most popular act, you know, I mean, I don't want to get you in trouble but in those days, who was the most, out of all those groups, Supremes, Temptations [The Temptations], you got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) All of them.
Speaker 1: Well you all were backing up Marvin Gaye at that point, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we did, we did do, they gave us a chance to, we basically opened the show. We had a couple of songs that we did.
Speaker 1: Which ones?
Speaker 2: One of them I remember, it was, a song called, 'Handful of Memories' ['A Handful of Memories'], I can't think of who it was by [Baby Washington], and I think we performed our song. We had the first record that we had made was called, 'I'll Have to Let Him Go' so we got a chance to do that, which was, nobody knew what it was, nobody have ever heard it, it was a no hit song but we did get a chance to perform it because--
Speaker 1: Was it a good song? Did you like it?
Speaker 2: I liked the song and basically what I like on the song, I like the harmony in the song. It's, it's, to me, it's a pretty song but it didn't sell, it didn't sell very well because even, once we ended the tour, our tour ended like at the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.], we had a week at the Howard, a week at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York], a week in Chicago [Illinois] at the Regal [Regal Theater] and Baltimore [Royal Theatre, Baltimore, Maryland], the four circuits. So during that time, Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] had us fly home because we didn't have a hit record, but we flew home while we were at the Howard one night and came back and recorded and we practically recorded a whole album that night and then flew back to Washington [D.C.] to be ready to open. We were doing five or six shows a day but the, the, the competition, I think, was with, because actually The Temps were on the show backing up Mary Wells, they didn't, they never even, they didn't even perform on the show, they were Mary Wells backup group. When we first found our first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Backup group for Mary--
Speaker 2: --in our first Motown revues ['Motortown Revue'], The Temps went out.
Speaker 1: She was big, she was real big at one time, wasn't she?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, they went out to back up Mary Wells so we had The Contours. And I think between The Contours, you really couldn't compare because everybody had their own different style. We might have ran it to, a thing with The Supremes once in a while because The Supremes were a little more known right then than we were, you know, 'cause we were first going out so we sort of like had a little competition with The Supremes, but everybody was, everybody just would go out there and try to outdo the other act.
Speaker 1: Were The Marvelettes on the trip?
Speaker 2: The Marvelettes were on the show and then The Marvelettes, they were more soul, more advanced than we were because I think they had their first hit record before we even got our hit record.
Speaker 1: It was '634-5789' [sic. 'Beechwood 4-5789'], is that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was out then and The Contours had, 'Do You Love Me'?
Speaker 2: 'Do You Love Me,' um-hm. Now The Contours they were the showstoppers because they did more soul, clips and this and that and this and that compared to The Miracles. The Miracles were more like the smooth group. That's the way it was with us. The Vandellas [Martha and The Vandellas] were more of a raunchy, you know, type of group and The Supremes were like more pretty type so but everybody held their own, everybody held their own but there was always a competition.
Speaker 1: It's always a good show when--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the shows were wonderful.
Speaker 1: Did one bus carry everybody?
Speaker 2: We did one bus. They had one big bus.
Speaker 1: It seemed like there are too many people when you name all these groups but it wasn't, I guess, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I think Marvin didn't ride on the bus and it was a couple more. Basically who was on the bus was The Supremes, us, The Marvelettes, The Contours, there was Sammy Ward [Singin' Sammy Ward], he was on the tour.
Speaker 1: And The Temptations?
Speaker 2: The Temptations, I think, yeah, The Temptations. So all of us were basically on the bus.
Speaker 1: Now this is pre-Four Tops, right? Four Tops weren't with you all yet?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think the Four Tops did their first tour with us.
Story_ID: 623747
Speaker 1: Tell me about your first, the first big hit that Martha and The Vandellas did?
Speaker 2: First big hit? First big hit, 'Come and Get These Memories.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because, like I said, we didn't have a hit. 'I'll Have to Let Him Go' didn't do much, but that was our first big hit, was 'Come and Get These Memories.'
Speaker 1: Okay, now how does it go? Can you hum a little bit for us?
Speaker 2: It's like, all right, (singing) "Lover you've gone from me and left behind, so many memories (scats), here's your old teddy bear, come and get it" (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Singing) "Come and get it." Right, right. You still have a pretty voice.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Speaker 1: You have a quality in your voice, just hearing you talk, it's like a Dinah Washington quality.
Speaker 2: Oh really, you think so?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a high, yeah there's, it sounds like that, to me, you know.
Speaker 2: That was one thing that everybody, all our fans always tell me that when they hear our records, they say, "I can always pick out your voice," that said, several people have told me that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I can, you know, it brings back memories just hearing you sing that 'cause I recognize the sound, yeah. So, you know, it's not, that's not true for all groups, you know.
Speaker 2: No, it's not.
Speaker 1: 'Cause then, I hate to say it for the Four Tops, I can never tell the rest of 'em. You know, Levi Stubbs, the rest of them would just, (makes sound).
Speaker 2: Right, they, yeah, they--
Speaker 1: You know, they have been good singers and, but they never seem to be distinctive of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, their voice doesn't stand out, they're just like one level, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, they were never off or anything so I guess they're doing what they were supposed to do but, you know--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm, they got the tight harmony but like you say, you can't distinguish, and I don't know why it is with us, maybe it's because it's just the two of us in the background, there's only a soprano and an alto so then that might be the difference.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so that's, that song becomes a, you record that one in what, '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: Sixty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that '62 [1962] or--
Speaker 2: --two [1962], yeah I think it was '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Let's see, I've got a guide here, oh yeah, '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963].
Story_ID: 623748
Speaker 1: Now I'm not sure if this is entirely accurate but my information says '63 [1963] but, okay. So 'Come and Get These Memories,' this is--so a couple of years you're doing mostly back up then for Marvin Gaye, is that true, would you say?
Speaker 2: Well, we [Martha and The Vandellas] didn't do too much, we didn't back him up too long except for that one set tour was over, then we sort of kind of got, once we made our first recording, we kind of got on the road and was kind of on our own except for when we did, like we did a couple more Motown revues ['Motortown Revue'] and basically at Christmastime we would always work in Detroit [Michigan]. They would always have us work at the Fox Theatre [Detroit, Michigan] at Christmas and there would be a Motown revue. Lines was like around the corner, you know, every show, we did that but then eventually everybody kind of ventured out on their own, doing separate venues and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they stopped having just a huge tour?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the huge tour, everybody basically was on their own. We got a chance to do the Copacabana in New York [New York], which was, that was exciting because The Supremes were the first group, Motown group [Motown Records], to do the Copacabana and with the type of act that they had, you know, they polished, were polished and they were really cute so I think they kind of thought maybe our, ours was a little too rash, too harsh for the Copa, but Maurice King, which was a musical director and a writer, he put together a whole show for us like a Copacabana show and it went over very well.
Speaker 1: Did you sing other songs other than the song that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did, yeah, we did a couple of show tunes, you know, and mixed in with our regular tunes.
Speaker 1: Okay, I remember having mixed feelings about that growing up, you know. I'd have been about thirteen at the time (laughter), so not a critic by any, you know, everybody was, but I did have mixed feelings about it and people in the black community, we were thinking like, what, why, you know, why they singing, have to sing some, you know, I don't want to hear them sing like the show tunes--
Speaker 2: The show tunes?
Speaker 1: Yeah, The Supremes had a Broadway show album out--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I like Broadway shows and, I think I was in a band and played some but I kept that separate in my mind from what The Supremes were doing. I think a lot of people were kind of, what are they doing, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, why aren't they doing that, you know, but they did incorporate most of our hit records and stuff like that but we did have to add a couple of show tunes.
Speaker 1: So was your act well received at the Copacabana?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it went over very well, very well.
Speaker 1: Were you surprised at the--
Speaker 2: I was, I was, I was, well it was kind of like, it's another nervous time, you know, we're going into the Copacabana because, you know, they build it up so much and they kept pumping this to you, you've got to be good, you know, you've got to be good so, but we did it, we performed.
Story_ID: 623749
Speaker 1: It seems to me that now we get into the heart of the, of the Martha and The Vandellas, you know, I guess, songbook, I guess, and with the, 'Heat Wave' coming out in '63 [1963] and then 'Quicksand' and then 'Dancing in the Street' in '64 [1964], so the next couple of years you have a lot of hits--
Speaker 2: Hits.
Speaker 1: --that people really are excited about. When you hear, people would hear 'Heat Wave' and 'Dancing in the Streets,' they would get up and dance (laughter). So, I mean--
Speaker 2: 'Heat Wave' was a pretty popular song. I think, if I'm not mistaken, 'Heat Wave' came out around the time when the riots or either before the riots, but there are a lot of, the radio stations associated that song with the riots, you know, you know, because of the fires and things that were going on.
Speaker 1: It's, 'cause I, heat--the riots in the, I think the first riots in Detroit [Michigan] didn't, occurred about '66 [1966] and '67 [1967], right? And so, I know Los Angeles [California] had one in '66 [1966] and Watts [Los Angeles, California] was a big, a big one and then Chicago [Illinois] didn't have its really biggest one 'til '68 [1968]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was around--
Speaker 1: --and then the riots in the summer of '66 [1966], I know that because even Dayton [Ohio] had a riot in '66 [1966], but they were, kind of all around the country, you know, spot riots or rebellions as some people would call 'em. People just got so angry they couldn't take it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, but 'Heat Wave,' maybe they would play it--
Speaker 2: Well they, that's what they did, they played it like we're having a heat wave, you know, and it sort of like the, it seemed like they were kind of trying to associate the song with the riots, you know, and with the 'Dancing in the Street,' but 'Dancing in the Street' was like, people were just dancing, you know, that was a popular song.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '63 [1963], 'Heat Wave' was out the year of the March on Washington, that summer and the Birmingham [Alabama] church bombing [at 16th Street Baptist Church] was later on that summer. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated that year (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, that, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now the writer of, did, did Holland Dozier and Holland write all those hits, pretty much?
Speaker 2: Yes, they wrote, they didn't do 'Dancing in the Street.' Mickey Stevenson [William "Mickey" Stevenson], Ivy Hunter [Ivy Jo Hunter], I think Marvin had something to do with that too, Marvin Gaye, 'Dancing in the Street,' but the other ones were Holland Dozier Holland.
Speaker 1: And was there a philo- now we were saying earlier, we were looking at the photos, you said that you all were considered like the wild girl group of Motown [Motown Records]. Was there, were there actually discussions about what kind of songs you all were going to sing and what role you were going to play?
Speaker 2: No, they just, the writers just wrote songs and they kind of just determined, "Well, we'll try this on The Vandellas," or something like, "We'll try this on The Supremes." And they would just have them record and if they, you know, got what they wanted out of it, then it was your song.
Speaker 1: Did you, were you aware of what their decision making process was as to whether they would have one group do a song or another group?
Speaker 2: No, not really, no, and, 'cause even eventually we just totally lost--Holland Dozier Holland were writing for The Vandellas first but then The Supremes--they, they used to call The Supremes the No Hit Supremes because they couldn't get a hit out (laughter).
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: So I think Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] had Holland Dozier Holland do something for The Supremes, but once they started writing for The Supremes and they got that hit then, there went Holland Dozier Holland for The Vandellas. We, we didn't get too many other songs written, they were so busy writing for The Supremes.
Speaker 1: So The Supremes hits were bigger when they finally got a hit from Holland--
Speaker 2: Once they, yeah, once Holland Dozier Holland wrote, started writing for them, they just took off.
Story_ID: 623750
Speaker 1: Did, do you have a favorite of those songs?
Speaker 2: My favorite is 'Jimmy Mack,' I like that one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay. Now that's not a Holland Dozier Holland song is it or is it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It is?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was one of the last ones I think that you all did?
Speaker 2: Close to it, yeah. Ho- Eddie [Eddie Holland], not Eddie, Dozier, Lamont [Lamont Dozier], wrote that song and I had heard that there was a story behind that that he was somewhere and he was talking to some woman and I think she mentioned something about her son being in the [U.S. military] service and his name was Jimmy Mack, and he just took that word and just all of a sudden started writing and that's how he came up with 'Jimmy Mack.'
Speaker 1: Now that's an interesting story. Now someone tried to tell me in high school, now I was in a mixed high school, it was mostly a white high school, and a Jewish friend of mine said, "Well, you know that song's about a pimp." And I said, "What?" You know, and he said, he said, "Yeah," he said, "a mack is a pimp. So the song is about--," he was trying to explain his version. I said, "I always thought someone--is that true?" You know, "So you're telling me--no, that's not true" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, now the way I heard it, what I heard and I think I heard from a reliable source, but they, that was the story, that the lady's son's name was Jimmy Mack and she was talking to him about his son, her son, and he just all of a sudden come up with the song, 'Jimmy Mack.'
Speaker 1: "Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back," but it's more coming back from--
Speaker 2: And then I don't know if basically the words were based on what she was telling him, but it might have been just the name. You know, when she mentioned that her son's name was Jimmy Mack, you know, he, just like that, he just, oh, you know, and just started writing about Jimmy Mack.
Speaker 1: Yeah, things aren't often exactly what, what people may think they are--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, because, so, that's interesting because I've always wondered about that song--
Speaker 2: That song.
Speaker 1: --when he raised that, I never thought about it before, when he raised it I thought about it--yes, we have to break? Okay, well at any rate, that's, no I never, I always thought, I thought about that, you know, is that really, I don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I've never heard anything like that before (laughter).
Speaker 1: It kind of made sense but then I didn't, you know, I said, oh maybe it's, I don't, you know, not everything that people think is true is true, so okay. So that was one of your favorites, okay. 'Heat Wave' and 'Quicksand' sound a lot alike but they both sold lots of records?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it had, for a while they had a trend going 'cause they had like 'Heat Wave,' it had like 'Quicksand,' then 'Live Wire,' a song called 'Live Wire' and then there was something else and they all basically like almost, almost the same.
Speaker 1: Okay, that (hums).
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so what was your part in 'Jimmy Mack'? Can you sing your part?
Speaker 2: Can I sing my part? Those, a lot of that was, was unison. My part was--well we, we'd start in (singing), "Jimmy, oh Jimmy, Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back? Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back? Hurry back, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy Mack won't you hurry back." So it's basically, a lot of it we did in unison and then we'd go into the harmony thing with, "Jimmy Mack."
Speaker 1: Did you ever see the, there was an episode of 'The Richard Pryor Show' where he actually had The Pips on and he, and I thought maybe, I said, "What happened to Gladys Knight?" And he said, "Well," he said, "I couldn't get Gladys Knight, so I just got The Pips," so they actually sang the background of every song.
Speaker 2: I saw that, yeah, you just had The Pips singing, uh-huh, yeah, I saw that, it was so funny.
Speaker 1: That was interesting.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, he couldn't get Gladys, so he just had The Pips huh?
Speaker 1: Right, and they sang the background to everything and then, you know, they're good singing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was too cute.
Story_ID: 623751
Speaker 1: Now you all did a big tour, in 1964 you went to England--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on tour. Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: That, that was our first tour, U.K. [United Kingdom] tour. That was Tops [Four Tops], it--yeah the Tops went, Temptations [The Temptations], Supremes [The Supremes], us, The Vandellas [Martha and The Vandellas], Stevie Wonder and it was like, we kind of, when we went, I think we had a couple of big shows together but basically they spread it out. We did one venue and the Tops did another venue and everybody had different venues, worked different venues and Dusty Springfield was kind of responsible for bringing the tour over there.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, Dusty Springfield (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, this is Dusty Springfield, she's associated with Burt Bacharach's music--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, Burt Bacharach and Hal David's music, so, so, yeah, how was that hook up, do you have any idea?
Speaker 2: I don't know. She's, somewhere she negotiated that with Motown [Motown Records] to, to bring, well, with the people over there, she kind of talked to him and actually we did, taped a TV show with Dusty ['The Sound of Motown'] and she had all different acts performing and we had a chance, the oppor- had the opportunity to sing background behind Dusty on that, that same show. So that was, that was her thing. She, she put that whole show together and talked to the producers and talked them into doing the show.
Speaker 1: I know during that era, we were all surprised, I think I was surprised at a certain point when we found out that the woman that sang the title song for the James Bond film, 'Goldfinger' was black, Shirley Bassey. Did you get a chance to meet her over there?
Speaker 2: No, I never got a chance to meet her, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause it was just, I just, we just couldn't imagine an English woman, you know, with that voice--
Speaker 2: Singing that, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --a black woman in England, you know. Okay, so, well what else happened on the trip?
Speaker 2: Well that was basically, we did a lot of work, worked, all work no play, and we did get to perform in Paris [France]. I think we went to Paris for one day and did a show, the whole group, the whole Motown group and those, basically, I think we were over there for about a week or two, maybe, maybe two weeks or something and just, just performing.

Speaker 1: I have heard and I've read too that on that tour, in fact they had, there was a movie ['Standing in the Shadows of Motown'] done a few years ago about The Funk Brothers and you've probably seen it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they were talking about how the bass player--
Speaker 2: Jamers- Jamerson, James Jamerson (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Jamerson, yeah, James, yeah, Jamerson, who played a bass with his thumb, or forefinger rather, forefinger, you know, in an unconventional style, that the people over in England actually knew his name and none of us over here knew the names of The Funk Brothers. We didn't know who they were.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: We'd just buy a Motown record [Motown Records] and put it on--
Speaker 2: Just, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and we knew, we didn't barely know who Holland Dozier Holland was. We saw their name down there but we didn't know they were writers or what, what they were. They was in parentheses under the, you know, we knew, we didn't know who anybody was in The Vandellas except Martha, you know, 'cause that was her name, Martha Reeves and The Vandellas, Martha and The Vandellas (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah, that yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: We didn't know it was Reeves for a while until we finally found that out, but over there in England they said that everybody knew who James Jamerson was.
Speaker 2: They are, they are pretty much aware of quite a bit over there 'cause I am surprised that there's a whole lot that they know about us that, that we didn't know, you know. They can tell you, there's a guy that's visiting here and he's, he just came over last week from England, and he was just telling us about how the people over there, he said, they know everything about you. He said, if anything you don't know that you want to know, you just contact somebody in England and they could tell you and they can tell you what records you made, they can tell you when they came out and everything. So, it, I mean they are more up to date on us than people here in the states.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about, how, did you kind of sense that when you were over there that there was a big following that went a lot deeper than--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause we had, and then there's a whole, we have a whole lot of diehard fans over there. You know, they just, whenever we go over there, we were very well accepted, you know, they just, they just love us over there and we never thought that, you know, we were that popular over there but all the groups, any, any Motown group that goes over there, they're very well accepted and it doesn't make a difference when they go or, you know, whatever. If it's years and years from now, they're still there, welcome you with open arms.
Speaker 1: I know when we were interviewing [HistoryMaker] Martha Reeves, she told us that there was a time period not, and it may still be going on that you all go over there, you go over every year and perform in England--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, yeah. We haven't had the opportunity to go over there yet. Well, we did go over there, I think it was last year, as The Original Vandellas, because right now we're not performing with Martha anymore. We do have a new lead singer [Roschelle Laughhunn], but we went over there with our past lead singer, former lead singer, her name was Pat Lewis and we did a place called, Prestatyn [Wales], and it's like a weekend thing where you go, you know, you, they have bungalows and stuff and you just spend the weekend and we were just totally shocked at the people that were there and the way they accepted us, you know, even though it was just The Original Vandellas. So we went over very well with them and they always tell you, "Please come back, come back."
Story_ID: 623753
Speaker 1: Well first, I probably should just go on and just pick up where I left off, chronologically, and I'll get to that part about the name and the use of the name and that sort of thing, but, after the tour in Britain [Great Britain], I think you all performed, were pretty, going pretty strong, you know, throughout the '60s [1960s], right, until about 1967, I think?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that when--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah. I, I left in like '68 [1968]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, believe it or not, it's maybe about fifteen years later--
Speaker 1: Well tell us about leaving first before we get to that, you know, what happened because that's a kind of a dramatic story that, it's kind of unexpected. A lot of us expected to hear music from Martha and The Vandellas and all the groups for a long, long time to come, you know, and then what, you know, I think Martha and The Vandellas is one of the groups that experienced, when Motown [Motown Records] moved, well just tell us what happened. What happened?
Speaker 2: Well actually I don't know what happened. I mean, I actually went on the road and when we came back off the road, they called me down to the studio and they told me, "Martha [HistoryMaker Martha Reeves] doesn't want to sing with you anymore." I never got any reason or anything else, that was it, and believe it or not, I did try to contact her 'cause I, you know, wanted to talk to her and see, well, what was the problem, but I had not seen Martha for at least, say maybe ten or fifteen years.
Speaker 1: I mean, this is after you got the news (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After that, after I got that message, I never saw her.
Speaker 1: So the message you got was from the office, the Motown office?
Speaker 2: From the office, from, yeah, um-hm. From--
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so that meant just contract's finished and--
Speaker 2: That was it, you know, they just negotiated, you know, a settlement and I had to go through Harold [Harold Noveck] to get that because it didn't work out the way it was supposed to work out. I even actually had to sue Martha in order to get what I was supposed to get, but--
Speaker 1: Now I imagine that was a big shock, you know, of all of a sudden just--
Speaker 2: It was, yeah, just to come like off the road and not even to talk to her, you know, for them to just call me down and said, "We need to talk to you." And I go down there to see--and his name was Ewart Abner, he was at Motown then and he just called me in into my office and this is what he told me, and then he explained to me, not explain to me, he just out and out said, "If she had to go on the road tomorrow, we can replace you 'cause you're not a lead singer, but if you had to go on the road tomorrow, then, you know, there's nobody to sing lead, so you couldn't go so, you know, that's the option." So that was it, no explanation.
Speaker 1: So, all of a sudden you're thinking, well what am I going to do, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I said well, you know, how (unclear). So that's how I ended up working at Ameritech [Ameritech Corporation; AT&T Teleholdings, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay, but you said you had to file, file a suit to get--
Speaker 2: I didn't--yeah, they had made a settlement that was supposed to be, you know, I was supposed to get X amount and, you know, but they never followed through.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is for royalties going forward (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For, for, no, it was just for leaving. It was like a lump sum settlement, you know, that I was supposed to get, but I never got it. And then after, you know, a while, Motown, it was like, you're gone and they just never thought about you anymore. You know, not even trying to, to take care of you and make sure you got what you were supposed to get.
Story_ID: 623754
Speaker 1: So my next thing was I had to get an attorney, you know, to go in and get what was due to me. So, and that's the way it even was with the royalties, you know, and just being honest. They never continued to send us royalties, you know, it just, it was just like you're just gone, that's it and royalties were steady coming in. We had to go and sue Motown [Motown Records] in order to get our royalties.
Speaker 2: Now is this, from what you understand of the music industry, is this unusual for a record company to not give you your--
Speaker 1: I would think it would--I would think it, you know, because if, if yearly statements come in and they say, "Okay, you got X amount of royalties for Martha and The Vandellas," and it's, it's divided up, then what was wrong with contacting you saying, you know, "You have royalties." That's, I could never understand that. Why not? They knew where you were. It's not that we don't know how to get in contact with you, but it was just once you were gone, you were just gone and it took about fifteen years, close to it, before somebody came to us and said, "You guys--well, aren't you getting your royalties?" And we said, "No, we're not getting our royalties." So then they went into this place, a guy [Charles Rubin] he has a artist rights and royalties--which he represents a lot of artists that don't get their royalties. So eventually, how it happened, he contacted us one day and said that, "You guys, you know, you're supposed to be getting residuals. When they show something on TV, you're supposed to be getting paid for it and you girls are not getting paid for it." So, he said, "What I do is I go after these people, you know, to see that you get your money," but the only catch to that, which we didn't realize 'til later on, because we had to sue them, was they got your money but they had, get 50 percent. Anything they got for you, they got 50 percent. So for a couple of years, they, he continued to do this, you know, so everybody was saying, "Well, something is better than nothing," you know. So we signed this little contract and when, about a year or so later, he just informed us, he said, "You girls are not getting your royalties, are you?" We said, "No, we're not getting our royalties." "Okay, we're going to sue for your royalties." So they sued Motown for our royalties and eventually they got, we won a suit, then we lost a suit, but they did get our royalties. So they started, then they started paying royalties every two months, I mean, every--twice a year but they would in turn send the royalties to Artists Rights [Artists Rights Enforcement Corporation]. They'd take their 50 percent and then they would send us our 50 percent. So that's--
Speaker 2: So they wouldn't send them to you first and then you send Artists Rights (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, they sent them to--
Speaker 2: It went to Artists Rights first?
Speaker 1: Motown sends to him the check every two months, six months.
Speaker 2: That doesn't seem right.
Speaker 1: He takes his 50 percent and sends us the check for our 50 percent and we, kind of after so long, people were saying, well, he's not, then, he was suing. So once the suit was done, that was it. "So he's not doing anything for you guys now except getting your check and mailing it to you. So you shouldn't be, that should be over in other words, that, that should be null and void that you have to give him 50 percent," but when we went to sue him, to get out of that, they, he won the case. The judge won them the case because they said there was a clause in there that says, some kind of, I don't know exactly what the wording was but it meant forever--
Speaker 2: In perpetuity, yeah.
Speaker 1: --it meant, from now on. You know, even when you're gone, we will get 50 percent and your relatives or whoever would get the other 50 percent, but that was something that could not be broken. So, that was it.
Speaker 2: But it doesn't seem right, but--
Speaker 1: No, unh-uh, and he's, but he's done it to The Shirelles. He has quite a few of the groups.
Speaker 2: Now is this, does this agreement include only back royalties or if you made, if for some reason or another you got together with [HistoryMaker] Martha Reeves and made a new record and everybody in the world bought it, would he still get 50 percent of your royalties?
Speaker 1: No, that, I don't, I don't think that, that's just basically what goes to, to, to what's his name now?
Speaker 2: It's for back royalties?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: But even, even the records that, just what we did with Motown 'cause anything that's selling now, even though it's selling now, they still get, but now it's where they get it off the CDs [compact disc], you know, because they're not doing vinyls anymore so even with the CDs and whatever what comes in they get it but now if we happen to go out and record now and get royalties, they, they wouldn't ha- be entitled to that.
Story_ID: 623755
Speaker 1: So, well what did you do after the, I mean, what did you do for income and for a career after you--
Speaker 2: Well that's it, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) after the end of Martha and The Vandellas?
Speaker 2: That's why I went to work (laughter). So I worked for twenty-nine years.
Speaker 1: So you worked for the phone company--
Speaker 2: Phone company. I put in--
Speaker 1: --for Michigan Bell [Michigan Bell Telephone Company], okay.
Speaker 2: --Michigan Bell.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I put in twenty-nine, almost thirty years.
Speaker 1: And you became a supervisor I read, I think, for something--
Speaker 2: Well, I never made the supervision, but I was like a senior clerk but that did, that's, you know, next step to supervision but basically I was, did computer, computer specialist and started out with keypunch. You know, we used to punch, you know you have those little cards you used to get with the little holes in 'em and stuff, we used to do that. I started, that's how I started out, it was called keypunch--
Speaker 1: Right, keypunch, I've heard it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) then they, you know, advanced to using computers and did away with all that stuff but--
Speaker 1: Now when people, now did you, did people recognize that you were one of the Vandellas during the time or--
Speaker 2: Sometimes, not--most people didn't, didn't much pay attention to it, but I had one girlfriend that worked with me and when anybody ever came in, she would always be the one to say, "Oh, you know, she used to sing with The Vandellas," so, but I'd never just go in there telling people or told, you know, stuff now. Sometimes if I was on the street or something and somebody will say, "Oh, I've seen you, so I know your face, you look familiar," you know. Then I would say, "Yes, I probably--you know, I sing," then they'd say, "Oh, yeah, I know that's where I knew you from," but normally I'd, you know, never really just go out and tell everybody.
Speaker 1: Is it, was it easier not to be recognized as one of the Vandellas in, in those days? Just the other day, I think Gary Coleman was on TV talking about what a curse it was to be recognized everywhere you go and not be, you know, and not be at the same level, you know, that you were in?
Speaker 2: It really never bothered me, you know. I just felt, hey, this is, this is it, you know. This is, this, that was me then and this is me now, you know, so.
Story_ID: 623756
Speaker 1: So you said about fifteen years after--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, about fifteen years after, Martha [HistoryMaker Martha Reeves] contacted me one day and, I mean, I think during this time she had been singing with her sisters [Lois Reeves and Delphine Reeves] and everything and, you know, Martha is like, one day she's like perfect and then the next day, you know, she's, you can't talk to her, you know. So I think around that time she had gotten angry with her sisters about something. So she just happened to call me on the phone and she told me, this is right around New Year's, one year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had you talked to her before in fifteen, fifteen--
Speaker 2: No, no, I was shocked to death when I got that phone call. I was even shocked that she still had my number. And I got that phone call and she said, "This is Martha." "Martha." And she said, "Well, I got a date coming up, it's a New Year's date and, you know, I thought I would call you and see if you wanted to do this date with me." And I said, you know, "Oh my goodness." I had to think about that but then I told her, "Okay," and then she had told me she was going to get, find some other girl to sing the bottom. So I told her I said, "Well, why don't you let me call Annette [Annette Beard]," you know, 'cause I still stayed in contact with Annette, "and see if she wants to do it." So when I called her, she said, yeah, she'd do it. So, that's when we started recording, I mean, working with her again and we worked with her for a good eight, maybe eight years, believe it or not. And then all of a sudden, it was like, "I don't want to sing with you girls no more, I'm singing with my sisters," you know. So it was like a back and forth thing and once in a while she'd get mad at her sisters, she'd call us and ask us to go out with her and we'd say, "Okay, you know, we'll go," 'cause all we got to do was go out there and sing, come on home and go back about our business. So that, you know, happened for a couple of years, back and forth thing, then all of a sudden it just ceased. We just quit, quit hearing from her. She just sent us a letter one day and said she was working with her new Vandellas. She had found some other girls that she performed with for a while. That didn't last too long. Then the next thing you know, she started working with her sisters again, so now she's, she's with her sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you really don't know what the motivation behind some of the changes are?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did, during the interim, during that time period, did you, did you do any singing otherwise?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you never, you know--
Speaker 2: I didn't start singing again 'til she called me.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, is there a reason why not or, you know, 'cause you could, definitely were, knew how to sing backup and was good, you know, you were good at that even if you didn't want to do lead?
Speaker 2: Well I, you know, I don't know. I just, I guess I just never thought about doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay, and no other groups called up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like I said--
Speaker 1: --no other people called up and said, hey, I, you know--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --since you all are available--
Speaker 2: That's surprising too, nobody called and asked me would I sing with them (laughter).
Story_ID: 623757
Speaker 1: But then, so like I say that's when, just about, almost three years ago now, that's when people just, they kept telling us, you know, "Well, why don't you girls just find you somebody else, you know, and just continue to sing?" But we were sort of like, maybe waiting to see if Martha [HistoryMaker Martha Reeves] would call us up, being loyal to her and say, well, maybe she'll, you know, want us to sing with her again, or something, maybe something will come up. But then they finally instilled into us that, "You're wasting time. Now, if you girls want to sing, you need to get out there and sing." So, we, we started singing with another girl for a little while, but we made the mistake of, that's the one we went to England with, we made the mistake of naming--they said, "Well, what are you going to call yourself?" So we said, we, we'll do, Original Vandellas featuring Pat Lewis [The Original Vandellas featuring Pat Lewis] and that first gig, when we went to England, then we realized, "Uh oh, we made a mistake." Because people were telling us, "Here you go, right back into this, putting somebody in front of you. You see, you should, it should not be Original Vandellas and Pat Lewis, you should not be featuring anybody, you should be the--a group." And then it got to a point, we changed it and she decided that she was trying to push herself. You know, she didn't like the idea of us dropping the Pat Lewis. Well, okay, so she decided that she didn't want to sing with us anymore. So then they suggested, "Why don't you all run audition, you know, and just--." They gave us a list of names and everything and we did audition and we auditioned a girl [Roschelle Laughhunn]. So that's how we got this new girl and the group is The Original Vandellas and I said we copyrighted the name and everything so we would be sole owners of the name.
Story_ID: 623758
Speaker 1: Now the, the name, you said, we were talking during the break, the name had never been copyrighted before, The Vandellas?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Now, well tell us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nobody owns the name.
Speaker 1: Okay, well give us first some background. Where did The Vandellas come from? Where did that name come from?
Speaker 2: The Vandellas were, okay, we were The Del-Phis and when Berry wanted to sign us, he did not want to have to go through the legal hassle of using Vandell- Del-Phis and then somebody come along and say, "I own that name," you know, and want to sue for the name. So he told us, "You got to, have to change the name, you're going to have to change your name." So we said, okay. So, there was the four of us. There was Gloria [Gloria Williams], Martha [HistoryMaker Martha Reeves], myself and Annette [Annette Beard]. We were in one little room. So he said, "I'm going to give you a half an hour to come up with a name. If you can't come up with a name, whatever I think of or whatever it is, that's what it's going to be." We did not come up with a name, so the next thing we know, he called down, he said, "I've got a name for your group and it's going to be Vandellas," pure and simple.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I heard a story that--
Speaker 2: It wasn't because of Van Dyke Street and Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett] and, and see at that time, I believe, we were not in circulation. We, nobody ever came to us and asked us questions like this, you know, "Where did the name come from?" Or this and that so, but they did have access to talk to Martha. So, we believe this is what she came up with. Rather than actually say that Berry gave us that name, this is where she came up with because we said, ourselves, "Now, if all of us are in a room, why would I let you, because your favorite singer is Della Reese, you lived on Van Dyke Street, why would I let you use what your favorite singer is? What's wrong with who my favorite singer is or where I live or where the other ladies, why couldn't we get together and agree on a name?" So, we never had any input with that and that's the story that actually is out and we have definitely been trying to correct that 'cause anybody asks us where the name comes, we give [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy credit 'cause he did not--he did come up with that name.
Speaker 1: Okay, now in the beginning, was it just The Vandellas or was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the beginning, it was The Vandellas.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was everybody.
Speaker 2: That's what he said, Vandellas, period.
Speaker 1: Like The Supremes were The Supremes?
Speaker 2: Like Supremes, Marvelettes [The Marvelettes], Temptations [The Temptations], Four Tops, [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson--The Miracles.
Speaker 1: So there was never--
Speaker 2: It wasn't Smokey Robinson either.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: Then eventually, when they started that, Smokey Robinson, then they started the, you know, Diana Ross and The Supremes and everything, then--
Speaker 1: How did people feel on that first? I know, I mean, I think it was pretty obvious, you know, people knew who the lead singers were but, but how did people feel when they, you know, that started to happen?
Speaker 2: I know we were upset. I mean, because, and we knew that it was done for the simple fact because he started out with Diana Ross and The Supremes, and at first it was Diana Ross and The Supremes so, of course, "Well, if it's Diana, how come it can't be Martha and The Vandellas?" You know, and so they just, it just became a thing where everybody had to have their name in front of the group.
Speaker 1: Now the Four Tops never did that?
Speaker 2: They never did it. Now the Four Tops were more of a group, you know. They, they had been together for so long, years, and everything and I don't think they would even think about wanting to do that.
Speaker 1: Well, I sort of, just looking at it from just a fan standpoint, I think of all the groups, probably none was there, where there's no group where there's that, that dramatic a difference in the background and the featured singer.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Levi Stubbs, people didn't know who he was, his name for years, but he was obviously the, you know, the driving, you couldn't, you know, force. I mean, the rest of them, you know, we didn't even know what their voices were like necessarily.
Speaker 2: Right, right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: He had that powerful baritone voice that just, you know, but it was never Levi Stubbs and the--
Speaker 2: Never Levi Stubbs and The Temps. David, David wanted to do it, he wanted to be David Ruffin and The Temptations, but they said, "No, no way, you know, we will not do that." And then with us, it was, first it was Martha and The Vandellas for a while and then we're on some of the, I think on our first record, it says Vandellas, that's it. Then the next one, I think it was, it was Martha and The Vandellas.
Story_ID: 623759
Speaker 1: Now let me ask this. I never thought of this before, this just occurred to me, that when you have a group, and I've been in groups before but doing other things, but sometimes there's a group dynamic where the most talented person is not necessarily the leader--
Speaker 2: The leader.
Speaker 1: --of the group, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is this, and I'm not necessarily, you know, reflected on anybody's, any specific group, but this is generally true with the most talented person and not necessarily the leader?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And is this, how, so did that, you know, well just speak to that in terms of this dynamic of the names?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I just, it's just that ego. They think because they're doing all the lead that, you know, that they should be out there but, any, with Diana [Diana Ross] now, I don't know, well, I can't say 'cause I don't know, I don't think that was her idea, I think that was Berry's [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] idea. Like I'm not sure, I don't know they discussed that and everything and he decided, but he did that. So like I said, once that happened, then it started just being a roll around, everybody wants to be, you know, their name out front.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I think in The Temptations, I know, David Ruffin has passed and can't even, you know, can't even address this now, but he probably would, a lot of people recognized him as the most talented person in the group, anyway, but Otis Williams [HistoryMaker Otis Clayborn Williams] is really the leader.
Speaker 2: And see, yeah, Otis, it's Otis' group and Otis did not sing lead, you know, so, and you got, you had Paul [Paul Williams], Paul was a fantastic lead singer, Eddie [Eddie Kendricks], all of them sang lead and like I said, Otis--it was Otis' group. So, they weren't going to just sit, and then sometimes lead singers they feel like they do most of the work. You know, they say, "I'm, I'm the lead singer, I sing all these songs, I've got to sing all these songs," but they, it just seemed like they never realized that you got a background too and they also do about just as much work as the lead singer. You know, you got to do your routines, you've got to think about your notes, you've got to stand back there and sing so it should be just a group. That's the way I feel about it.

Speaker 1: So since you formed The Original Vandellas, you've been performing around the country, I guess, in different, just tell us what you--
Speaker 2: Well we haven't been around the country, but we're hoping to get there. We, we do a few little things. We have--
Speaker 1: You said you went to Britain [Great Britain].
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, we did go there, we did, I take it--yeah, but basically we've been, well we did get a chance to do a show in Baltimore [Maryland], a couple of, early part of the year, February we were in Massachusetts, so we're getting, slowly getting, you know, work coming in. We've got something coming up in, next month. We've got a couple of things coming up in the city [Detroit, Michigan], but we're doing a few things.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you enjoy what you're doing?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Oh, I love it, I love it, yeah. We even got one of The Contours, he sings with Joe--now you know there's two Contours now, they split. One of the guys quit and took his group and they got Sylvester Potts and the Contours [The Contours featuring Sylvester Potts]. Then they got Joe Billingslea Contours [The Contours with Joe Billingslea], and he's [HistoryMaker Joe Billingslea, Jr.] actually the only original Contour, but they had to go to court over that, you know. It was a battle as to who could use the name, so it was settled that, when they use it, it has to be Joe Billingslea Contours or Sylvester Potts Contours, but what I was trying to say, there's a, one of the guys in The Contours, his name is Al Chisholm, he started a gospel group and it's called Motown Legends Gospel group [Motown Legends Gospel Choir], which recently just, just Sunday, we just did a show at a church in Warner, Ohio and the group consists, consists of The Original Vandellas, The Contours and they've got one of the guys in The Miracles. So, basically, they have, then they have a couple of, three or four more other voices but this, it's, that's actually based around The Contours, The Original Vandellas and one of The Miracles and a guy named Spyder Turner. So he's trying to get that off and so we're, we hopefully, you know, get to do some traveling around doing it with the gospel group.
Speaker 1: It sounds like a great idea--
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: --and, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is.
Speaker 1: --excite a lot of people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we had a wonderful concert in Ohio Sunday. It's wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, any, any other future, do you have any recording plans?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, we are working on a recording now. One of these, The Miracles, his name is Scott [Mark Scott], he has a studio and, for the last couple of weeks, we've been going into his studio doing, we, right now, we're working on, he's got a couple of songs for us, but basically we're working this one song right now that we're working on and it's almost finished. So hopefully when he gets that done, you know, we can do something with it and get it out.
Story_ID: 623761
Speaker 1: Now, I know, occasionally, I think there's, there's always, there's a Motown [Motown Records] reunion or revue or something or something, you know, to get, try to gather all the, do you all participate in those--
Speaker 2: They haven't actually had a revue, entertainer revue--I mean they've had like a, they've had the fiftieth [anniversary] last year, but it was basically all the groups just got together. I mean, they, people came in from California and everything and it was like a big affair, a big dinner and I think--
Speaker 1: So do you get invited to those kind of things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they'll, they invite us to those different occasions, and I think this last one they just had for the fiftieth, The Temptations came in and entertained. So they may have somebody and the last one, I think, Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] came in and entertained, but they haven't had, used any of our local groups yet, like us [The Original Vandellas] or The Contours or The Velvelettes or, yeah, but it's just a big get together. Everybody gets together and, during that weekend, everybody has fun, get a chance to see people you haven't seen in years and--
Speaker 1: What's your, I guess, personal reflection on the legacy of Motown?
Speaker 2: I think it's wonderful because, because it's something that, I don't think it will ever die. I mean, we will never be ancient, we will always be history and always be, we'll never be outdated, I don't think, because our songs, our music is, is, this is like fifty years of Motown and you're still hearing. You turn the radio and you're still hearing Motown, wherever you go, you hear Motown, and it's just never outdated.
Speaker 1: The sound of young America.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, still young. We may be old in age but we're still young (laughter).
Story_ID: 623762
Speaker 1: All right now, what advice would you give to young people today? In fact, let me just ask you like, what do you think of the music today, you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know what to say about that because I, well I, it's not my favorite kind of music, but I know that as, you know, time goes on, things are changing and it definitely has changed, but it's just not my kind of music. I guess I'm stuck in the old times, you know, stuck back in the days of the '60s [1960s], and I guess I'll always be stuck in the '60s [1960s] but some of it is, is decent but I'm, I just can't get with the language, you know, that they use in the music now. It's just, to me, I just can't, I guess I'll never be able to accept that but, and you do have some talented people, you know, but, just, the wrong music.
Speaker 1: Of the young artists that are out today, do you have a favorite?
Speaker 2: Not really. I like Alicia Keys and, what's the other, basically, I, I, I kind of like Alicia Keys.
Story_ID: 623763
Speaker 1: What advice would you give young people today that want to get involved in show business now? What do you think they have to first like, you know, bear in mind as they--
Speaker 2: I think my advice would be to really know what you're getting into. I mean, know the music and be aware of, of what your, contracts, basically. When you get a contract, just have somebody, you know, look over it and explain it to you and just learn the ins and outs, or either have somebody that can oversee, you know, the, the music part, what's involved, 'cause there's a lot of ins and out and it's not just like, I'm going to make a record and just, just be happy that, just be aware of what's going on, you know, in the backgrounds.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's the time of a lot of excitement and promise, but they should be mindful of what they're doing?
Speaker 2: Right. Be mindful of what you're doing and kind of get some kind of experience, you know, just have some kind of experience 'cause it's changed a lot now, because you see a lot of the entertainers, they're here today and give 'em two, three years or something, you never hear 'em again, you know, and that's because, maybe because of mismanagement and things so they just have to be aware of what they're doing.
Speaker 1: I guess, I guess what you're saying too is that a career doesn't last forever necessarily or the big part of it is not going to last forever.
Speaker 2: Right, that's true, yup. You can be up there today but tomorrow, you'll be right back down there.
Story_ID: 623764
Speaker 1: Now what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Hm, my hopes and concerns is that things can be much better as far as the violence that, that we're experiencing, all the crime and I don't, I don't know if that will ever happen because there's always going to be something, some type of crime somewhere but it's just that, especially our African American, you know, boys, guys, you know, just, if they could just, I don't really know how to explain it, but just more unity with, within our people, you know. Stop, just killing people and just, just being upset because somebody said something that you didn't like, but it's just where we can get along and, and respect our own people.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have any feelings about the future of the City of Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think Detroit is growing. It's, it's improving. They're building up instead of building down, it's building up because they're beginning to tear a lot of the abandoned homes that we have sitting around, empty houses and everything. They're cleaning up. Detroit, is, is come a long way and I think it's got, it's going to be a whole lot better in the future.
Story_ID: 623765
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. I think I've pretty much did it right or whatever it came--I accepted whatever, but I know one thing, I would probably learn how to manage my finances a little better but other than that, I think I--I'm up there in age now, so I think I have done as much as I could possibly do.
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess, this is a question that I might have asked, it just occurred, I'll just ask, it just kind of popped in my head here, I was thinking about your career and some, you know, basically singing backup for a very popular group, is there is a philosophy behind being able to sing backup and be a good backup singer in a group? We've interviewed The Impressions, you know, who've also carried all their name in The Impressions, Sam Gooden [HistoryMaker Samuel Gooden] and his partner, you know, is there is a philosophy behind being able to do that right?
Speaker 2: I, that's a, I don't think so. I think it's just, being a backup is just the harmony, just being able to sing together and harmonize together 'cause, 'cause people never really realize, there's a lot to being a backup group, 'cause you have to remember notes and things like that and that is basically, to me, the prettiest part of any type of song, is the harmony, and that's what I'm stuck on, is the harmony.
Story_ID: 623766
Speaker 1: Oh, tell me about your, you got a son [Damon Holmes, Sr.], I know, well tell me about your family.
Speaker 2: My family, oh, okay. My son, he's, he's a Christmas baby, he's born December 25th, 1973 and that makes him sixty--oh, I'm sorry, he'll kill me, thirty-five, thirty-six. I have to add (laughter), thirty from ten--seven, he'll be thirty-seven on Christmas and he has three beautiful children. He has one boy [Damon Holmes, Jr.], he's four years old, well he just turned five in March and that, that's my problem child. I mean he's a sweetheart, but he's a busy, busy, busy guy. And he has, he has another little girl by his second marriage, her name is Alana [Alana Holmes], she's four, she'll be five in September. And then I just have to say, my favorite is my oldest, she's ten, her name is Kaimen [Kaimen Holmes], she's ten, I did say that, but the special thing about it is my birthday's September 2nd, her birthday's September 3rd. So that's Kaimen, and then my son has a, well he's just adopt- not adopted but sort of adopted because his second wife has a son, fourteen, and his name is Kimarti [ph.], so he's family too, he's part of our family too. So, I have a beautiful family and I just love my grandkids, they are so sweet and so special.
Story_ID: 623767
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything right offhand. Now probably once we're through, I'll think of everything, but no, I can't think of anything else.
Speaker 1: Okay, the last question is similar to legacy, I guess, but a little different. Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As me, as Rosalind Holmes [HistoryMaker Rosalind Ashford Holmes], that's the way I'd like to be remembered and hopefully that I'm well liked by people (laughter).

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which one is the Baltimore theatre? I, I knew it at one time but--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Did you actually play D.C. and Baltimore or just--
Speaker 1: Yeah, D.C. was the Howard.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, so we don't know the name of the one in Baltimore (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now I've got to think of the one in Baltimore. I don't--
Speaker 2: What is the name of that theatre? I used to know it but I can't think of it.
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what. When you see, when you see Joe [ph.] tomorrow--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Ask him.
Speaker 1: --remember to tell him, Rosalind--I might, we're supposed to bring somebody down there tomorrow to see the studio, so I may try to be down there when he's down there, but--

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 2: Tell him Rosalind said, let him know--tell you what theater it was because she forgot.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, well I'm with everybody, I'm with every--all three.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.

Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this schedule I have, I don't see him.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Oh, dear, I guess we won't see him. Who are we? We're doing somebody else.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's--well Horton [ph.] is out so we're doing, we're finishing--
Speaker 2: I'm going to think about that. I'm going to--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): That was a really good time was, everybody I talked to says that was the best time.
Speaker 2: Oh, we had so much fun, we said, and the one at the, it was one of them that somebody lived in the house across the street and they cooked and everybody would get off stage and they'd run across the street and, she had a table set out and everybody'd sit at the table and eat, then the, that shift come out then the next shift and then we'd run over there and we had about half an hour between shows and we'd, you know, and Apollo was like, we--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): That was crazy, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: We first--there, they put us way up at the top. You know you had to earn your, your rooms 'cause, you know, you had five or six floors with rooms so you had to work your way down to the first floor, to the stars room. We finally made it, but the first time we went there, they had us way upstairs and then they'd call you fifteen minutes and you had the shoes on, heels on and everything, run down the stairs, to be down on stage in time to go on the show then back and forth, up and down the stairs. It was, it was hilarious. That was the fun, that was the most fun that we have ever had on the road, you know, and everybody just, everybody just loved everybody and everybody was just so, you know, it was wonderful.
