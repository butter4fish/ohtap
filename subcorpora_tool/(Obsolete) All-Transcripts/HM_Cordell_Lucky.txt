Speaker 1: I wanted to ask about your father, Moses Cordell, what you know about his background.  You know, was he from Grenada also?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You want to know what I can tell you about his background?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yes what you can tell.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Moses Cordell, Sr. was born and raised in Grenada, Mississippi, moved to Chicago [Illinois] in about 1931.  He was in the Army. He served honorably and was discharged; married once after my mother [Grace Cordell] died and I guess that lasted for four or five years.  They had a very amiable separation.  She still came to see me and take me out.  And he and I after they broke up, he and I batched for the rest of the time until I went into the service.  It was just he and I.  And I can say without any hesitation he was both a father and a mother.  Had a beautiful relationship with my dad.
Story_ID: 5699
Speaker 1: Your mother [Grace Cordell] passed away when you were very you--early.  Right?
Speaker 2: At three years old.
Speaker 1: So do you have any memory of her?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Only pictures and stories from other older members of the family.
Speaker 1: Did your father [Moses Cordell, Sr.] ever share with you any growing up?  Of his growing up?
Speaker 2: No.  I know this.  I know that they were on a farm and my father owned the farm. And they raised cattle I guess enough to supply for their own family, chickens, hogs and like that.  But that's about all I know.  I was three years old.
Story_ID: 5700
Speaker 1: Do you know what prompted him to move to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was an accident that happened to one of my brothers.  These two brothers were extremely close.  This was in the South where it was not unusual to go hunting.  And they hunted quite a bit.  My dad [Lucky Cordell, Sr.] never allowed a loaded gun in the house.  If you wanted to go hunting, you can't load the gun until you're outside.  The brother that got hurt, Johnny, decided to go hunting.  And he went out, had took the shotgun.  He went out in the yard.  On the way to the gate, he remembered he hadn't finished his homework.  So he came back into the house, sat the loaded gun down behind the door.  My brother came in, the other brother Jack came in and saw the butt of the gun sticking out and jokingly said, "Hey Johnny."  Boom!  He pulled the trigger.  So he nearly--well he never got over it.  The brother that he shot outlived everyone.  He outlived the doctors that worked on him, he outlived all of his friends, the--just everybody.  He was--they asked my father--At that time it was not unusual for 'em to treat some of us like cattle.  So when you were broken up or messed up, they'd ask permission to give you the black bottle, which was like poison.  He asked my dad that and my brother who was like paralyzed could hear everything they were saying.  It's like a movie.  He could only move his feet under the cover.  So they couldn't see it.  So he was listening to see if my dad would pronounce the death sentence on him.  And my dad looked at the doctor and shook his head and said, "You did not give him that life.  I'll not permit you to take it away."  So he took him home.  My dad had never doctored on anything except maybe a horse or a cow.  But he stopped by the pharmacy.  He bought all kind of bandages and stuff that he'd heard about, Peroxide and whatever else.  He took my brother home, doctored on him, kept him alive for about three months while the farm was disposed of.  Then we came to Chicago.  That's how we got to Chicago.  My brother spent something like twenty years in the County Hospital, only coming home for visits.  They reconstructed his face. They gave him a new nose.  One eye was gone.  The bullets went in the front and came out the side of his jaw.  And it disfigured him.  He was one of the first plastic what do you call it?  When they were first getting into plastic surgery, he was one of the first. And they did a book on him.  I wasn't old enough to realize the importance of getting one.  But they did a book on him that thick, you know, so that other doctors coming along could see it.  The brother that did this I always said he had a death wish, because he would walk around in the dead of wintertime with his collar open.  He could never do enough for my brother Johnny.  I mean it was like he was there all the time.  You know, like what can he do?  This kind of thing.  And he got double pneumonia and died.  I think, you know, I think he had lost the will to live.  'Cause as I say he was his best friend.  They were really close.  So those are some of the memories that I have about what I've heard about the family growing up.  And that's about all I can tell you about that period.  Because as I say, I was just a baby.
Speaker 1: Now who are your siblings?  Are you the youngest?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and how many siblings did you have?
Speaker 2: Left? There was five.
Speaker 1: There were five of you.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know--can you give me their names?
Speaker 2: Sure.  There was Johnny Cordell, Charles Cordell, (pause).  There was Johnny, Jack, Charles, Eloise.  And the only sister that's still alive is Lataska, who lives with me now.  And she was the oldest sister.  So you can't tell when he's gonna call can you?
Story_ID: 5701
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of growing up?  They had to be--mainly be here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: They were here.  Well we lived on Cottage Grove [Avenue] at thirty--36th [Street] and Cottage Grove.  That's the first memory. That's where we moved to.  And then I don't remember how long we were there.  But we moved a block away to a place called Ellis Park, 3630 Ellis Park, where I grew up.  I went to Doolittle School [Chicago, Illinois], grammar school.  And we always--we moved a couple times but always within that area.  So I was able to go to Doolittle for the whole eight years.  I had good friends.  We were poor, but I didn't realize it because everybody around me was poor.  So we had a good--I had a good childhood.  Good relationship as I said with my dad [Moses Cordell, Sr.].  So I was--I felt pretty fortunate growing up.
Speaker 1: So he besides--how long was he remarried for?
Speaker 2: I think he remarried for about I'd say six years, five or six years.
Speaker 1: And how--what year--what ages were you during that time?
Speaker 2: Well just--I was three so you're talking about--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Three okay.  Oh so--three to like eight.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Eight.
Story_ID: 5702
Speaker 1: What was the young Lucky Cordell like? Were you quiet?  Were you introspective or no?  None of that.
Speaker 2: No I was not quiet.  I was energetic and active and gregarious. I love people.  I love company.  And I had two best friends, Henry Graham and Robert--.  Mercy, what's Robert's last name? It escapes me for the moment.  But we did everything together.  Robert Rowan.  When we got out of school, we came together.  We didn't leave each other until it was time to go home.  And many times we were at home together and spent the night.  This was a wonderful relationship of three guys.  And they're both deceased now.  But we didn't separate until Henry went into the service.  He went first.  And I think I went next.  I don't know whether Robert went into the service or not.  But we never hooked up again.  It's--well I take that back.  Years later, when I found out where Robert was, he was a barber in a barbershop.  And I went there.  And we renewed old friendship.  And I started to take my brother Johnny [Cordell] there.  That's where he always got his hair cut.  And he felt very comfortable with Robert 'cause Robert was like family.
Story_ID: 5703
Speaker 1: I've been asking this question just sort of to get a sense of a person's childhood.  But sights or sounds or smells remind you of your--of childhood.
Speaker 2: Well when I see advertisements for amusement parks, that takes me back to a place called Riverview [Park, Chicago, Illinois].  And this was a place where very popular in Chicago.  People used to look forward to going to Riverview.  That was like a big thing.  And to my knowledge at the time it was one of the few amusement parks there was.  I don't think we had another in Chicago.  So that reminds me--that takes me back.  Once in a while I'll meet someone that reminds me of my dad [Moses Cordell, Sr.].  And that'll take me back.  I see children sometimes who make me remember being a kid.  But I guess that's about all that takes me back.
Speaker 1: Any smells?
Speaker 2: I'd say barbecue. In the summer there were a lot of barbecues in my neighborhood.  So that'll take me back sometimes.  My dad was a great fisherman.  It became my first love in terms of a sport.  Often I would think about him when I'd go fishing.  And I remember him bringin' a big fish home.  And it was still alive.  And I asked him to please try to keep it.  And he said, "Son you can't keep this fish.  You'd have to do this and you change the water.  You'd have to feed him."  I said, "I'll do all of that."  He let me keep the fish.  Kept that fish for at least six months.  I fed him.  I changed his water.  I had a big tub.  One of the big tin tubs. And the fish turned gold.  I guess something in the water changed the color.  It turned gold like a goldfish.  And finally my dad said, "You know, fish is getting much bigger than your tub. Don't you think it's being unkind to keep him cramped up like that? Look, he can't even turn around." He kept talking to me until it made me feel bad.  So we took him over to the Lake [Michigan] and released him.  And I'd swear he came up and wished me goodbye.  'Cause he went down, then he came back up, then he went down.  So to me he was saying, "See ya!"
Story_ID: 5704
Speaker 1: The one thing that when I think about the old neighborhood [in Chicago, Illinois] that stands out is I was robbed.  It was an attempted robbery.  In my neighborhood, where my group was normally there--they call 'em gangs now. And this guy--I mean I was walking down the street, around the corner to the candy store.  I had a dollar in my pocket; get some candy, maybe a comic book.  This guy accosted me and said, "Loan me a dime."  I said, "I don't have a dime."  But in my mind I'm saying, "Is he crazy?"  "Doesn't he know he's in my hood?"  And so he said, "Now I'm gonna take all I find."  And up with the razor.  I know how dangerous that is.  So I said, "Well I don't have anything man."  He said, "Well I'm gonna search you."  So he patted me and no change.  I think he was about to give it up.  We had watch pockets in those days.  Little small pockets in the pants.  Most of 'em had it.  I had this dollar folded up and stuffed in my watch pocket.  He had this razor on my neck.  "If you move, I'm gonna pull it."  And I don't know, something in me just made me--today I certainly wouldn't do it.  But I jumped back and kicked him.  Right between the legs.  He went down. But on the way down, he cut me.  And I never will forget.  I found out I was a coward.  Because I kicked him a few times.  But I couldn't stomp his teeth out.  I mean I just--he was begging, "Please."  You know, I had my foot over his head with steel Brogans.  I'd've ruined him for life.  And the lady upstairs that we always complained about, who was so nosy.  I never was gladder to see a nosy neighbor.  'Cause she started screaming out the window, "Help! Help!  They're killing little Cordell!"  And she made such a ruckus.  Then this guy came from across the street, who was the brother of the guy that was down.  And so he was trying to get to me.  But my back was against the wall so I was fighting him off. And when she made such a ruckus, he figured he'd better get out of there.  So he helped his brother up and put him arm around his neck and they limped on down the alley.  By this time I mean--you know, I didn't even realize I was hurt.  Because a razor doesn't--you know, it's just a light touch.  Then I felt--and I saw it all down my leg and everything.  So I went back and I'm trying  to get in the house and clean up a bit before my dad [Moses Cordell, Sr.] sees me.  And I go through like--I had to pass through the living room.  And my bedroom is there.  And my sister was there. And as I turned my back, you know, like I closed the door and I turned my back kinda  going like that, into my room.  And my sister said, "What is that all over you?"  I said, "Nothin'.  I'll be right back."  She got up and turned me around and saw that blood and, "Aaaah!!!"  You know.  And my dad said, "What happened to you!"  And I explained what happened.  "Which way did they go?"  I said, "They're gone Dad."  Down the steps he went.  Down the steps he went after getting that old gun.  And I'm young but I'm praying, "Lord please don't let him kill somebody," you know.  And he popped a couple times down the alley.  I thought, oh boy he might have shot a bum.  Anybody, you know.  But he didn't.  And so they took me to the hospital.  And I never will forget the doctor saying to me--he had an attitude with me.  It was like he said, "If it had been a half-inch further, it'a hit your heart.  And you wouldn't have to worry anymore.  You wouldn't have to worry about gang banging." Or some phrase he used.  It was almost as if he assumed, you know, he didn't know what happened.  But the fact that I was a youngster, you know.  And that was at a time really--I don't see why he had that attitude.  Because at that time a good fight existed of a stick, a brick or just fists.  We didn't have any guns.  This proliferation of guns today, we didn't have that then.  So (pause) Oh!  Afterwards, here come my crew. Here they come (Laughing) when it's all over, you know.  Of course I was a hero you know, and had been wounded in the war.  So that's it Julie.
Speaker 2: Now I--how old were you when that happened?
Speaker 1: Oh, thirteen.
Story_ID: 5705
Speaker 1: The name 'Lucky' came to your, you know, preteens.  Was it around that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how did the event come about?
Speaker 2: Okay it came about because I used to predict the outcome of ballgames.  You know, we had like local neighborhood kids play other neighborhood kids.  And I would always go and watch both teams.  And then, in my opinion, I would guess which one was going to win.  And I was right so often, 'til they started calling me--saying I was, you know, good luck.  Lucky Strike. And finally the name Lucky just stayed.  And when I went into broadcasting, it was more appropriate then Moses.  So that's how it stuck.  Do you know today, the name Lucky is on everything except the mortgage.  I went some--and I was like funny.  Every once in a while someone from the old neighborhood would see me and call out, "Mose!"  "Mose!" Didn't register 'til it finally hit me.  And I'd turn around.  Because I'd been Lucky for so long, you know.  And that's how it came about.
Story_ID: 5706
Speaker 1: Were there other people influencing you in your teens?  Anyone else? Anyone you looked up to in the neighborhood, or, you know, or--?
Speaker 2: I know what you're saying.  And I got to say nobody that stands out.  My dad [Moses Cordell, Sr.] was it for me. There was one gentleman in the neighborhood I always respected, had great respect for him.  Because he was forever pickin' up from his yard, had a big dog that he took good care of.  And the kids all liked him, you know. So on occasion I thought I'd like to be like that.
Story_ID: 5707
Speaker 1: Did you--in high school.  You went to Dunbar [Vocational Career High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay was Dunbar what was closest to you at the time? Or did you choose Dunbar?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I chose Dunbar.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was a vocational school.
Speaker 1: Vocational school. And why did you choose it?
Speaker 2: Well at the time, when I was finishing grade school, they sent counselors around to entice the kids to come there.  And it sounded interesting for me.  And I understood later that the feeling was it was so hard for blacks to make it with just the regular type education that those persons who went there and studied automobile mechanics, or auto welding and so forth would have a way to make a living.  And I saw all of the different things that they taught, and I settled on aeronautical engineering.  I wanted to be an airplane mechanic. I picked the toughest one of all, right?  And I loved it.  I enjoyed it very much.  And it was like three years in to school that one of the young fellows that--Pratt is his name, graduated.  And everybody just knew Pratt would--he would just set 'em on fire.  'Cause this boy could literally take certain parts of an airplane engine down blindfolded and put 'em back together with just a touch.
Story_ID: 5708
Speaker 1: Pratt came back to school to visit and it was seeing him and talking to him that made me decide to go into service. He couldn't get a job.  This man who was like a genius had gone to all the airlines.  He couldn't get hired.  So I'm saying, if Pratt couldn't get hired, I don't stand a chance, you know.  So shortly after they were--it was like if they didn't--if you got drafted, they'd put you wherever they wanted you.  If you--
Speaker 2: Yeah because there was--the truck went by.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You were saying if they--.
Speaker 1: If you got drafted, they would put in any part--branch of the service they wanted to.  If you enlisted and supposedly, you could choose your branch.  And  I chose the Air Corps.  And I was in the [U.S.] Air Force for maybe thirty days.  It was--it was a sham.  I was in the air force for thirty days and then transferred to the infantry.  And that's where I did my time.  I did--well the other thing about that, I would talk to guys who had been in all these glamorous places, interesting, to Hawaii.  To the Virgin Islands. To all of these places, right?  And I thought, well I get a chance to see some of the world.  When I left where we did the basic training, they put us on a ship and started us to a place called Amchitka, Alaska.  It's a God forsaken island in the middle of nowhere where trees don't grow!  And on the way up there, I experienced a first storm.  This was a huge ship.  And this storm tossed that ship around like a cork.  It was just up and down. Roll.  Some of the--old swabbies we call 'em.  Some of the seamen who'd been there for years got sick.  You know, it was that tough. I did fine 'cause one of the guys told me what to do, an old seaman.  He said, "Look, get in your bunk, put your arms across your stomach, lay on your stomach.  That'll help you keep from getting sick."  And I did.  It worked until I had to go to the washroom.  And I walked into that washroom.  On a ship they have a long urinal.  Its like twenty guys could stand at the urinal at one time. And there were twenty guys at the urinal.  But they weren't--they were sick.  And the stench?  I got sick.  That's--and that's the only time I've really been sick like that.  Seasick.  We reached the island.  The accommodations were fine.  We had Quonset huts.  And that's where I spent my time.  The whole eighteen months on that island.  Never got a chance to go to France or Japan or any of these interesting places.  I really thought that I was going to Hawaii.  And you hear all--I even--I did a book on it.  All these stories you--rumors.  Look like every week there was a different rumor as to where we were going.  Now I do know this.  We weren't supposed to be going to Alaska.  The storm did something. And they decided to move us I guess to this location.  Rather than wherever we were supposed to go.  And that was my army experience.
Speaker 2: Now so that was sort of disappointing though.
Speaker 1: Very!  Very disappointing.  The one thing--one good thing out of it was while I was in training; I got with the 25th Infantry male choral group.  And that was a nice experience.  Because many times it got us out of work.  We'd go rehearse.  And because of this experience, they wanted me to re-enlist and they were gonna put me in special services so that I wouldn't be a foot soldier, so to speak, anymore.  I would be like in the entertainment end.  You know, they have--they put on shows to entertain the servicemen, and like that.  But I was glad to get out.  'Cause I didn't trust it any more.  I figured if they--they tricked me once, they might trick me again.  And so I left.  I got out with an honorable discharge.  And as an aside, I had no notion at that time just how that being in service for that length of time, how it would be important to me when I got to be this age.
Speaker 2: With the benefits--the retirement.
Speaker 1: With the benefits.  Had no notion of it.  I used it when I first got out of the service.  That's how I went to radio school.  I used the G.I. Bill to go to Radio Institute [of Chicago].  And--but that was as far as I could see.
Story_ID: 5709
Speaker 1: So you really got involved in theater and music in--
Speaker 2: In high school [at Dunbar Vocational Career High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: In high school.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I might even go back further really.  Because I was in a few little school plays in grammar school.  But I didn't have the kind of interest.  My interest grew.  When I got in high school, I really got interested in entertaining.  So when I got out, and I was trying to decide--I had decided, I'm not gonna waste this opportunity. The G.I. Bill to go to school?  And I was looking around and honestly nothing appealed to me.  I mean, I had no interest any more in becoming an aeronautical engineer.  Automobile mechanic didn't interest me.  Tailoring.  And a friend of mine was going to radio school.  Bill Gales (ph.).  And he said to me, "Lucky, why don't you come on down and go to radio school.  You got a gift of gab.  You like people.  I think you'd be perfect."  So I didn't think about it right then.  But the next time he spoke to me about it, I came down.  I said, "Can I sit in?"  He said, "Sure.  Come on down.  They'll let you sit in."  From the first class when I watched, my interest went sky high.  I said, "This is for me."  So the interesting part is my buddy who got me involved, he dropped out.  He just wasn't suited for it.  Beautiful guy.  I love him.  But at any rate, I went there [Radio Institute of Chicago] for--I finished the four-year course in three and a half years and taught for six months.  They tried their best to get me to stay there as a teacher.  But I had for four years, or three-and-a-half years at that time--I had gone to school at night and worked during the day.  I'd go to work in the morning, get up at seven, be there at nine.  I'd get off at five.  A buddy of mine drive me and drop me off.  I'd come home, take a shower, eat a bite and off to school until ten o'clock at night.  So I told 'em I was flattered and honored that they asked me to stay.  I said, "But I just--I've got to try radio." You know, I got to try not just teaching it.  And they told me, you know, if I was unhappy at what I was doing, then come back. They would be happy to have me back.  So then I went on and I went back to my job and told them that--oh incidentally I think one of the reasons they pressed so hard and wanted me was there were no black instructors at the time.  So I went back--I was working at Nachmann Spring Corporation.  They made springs for mattresses.  And I went to my supervisor and told him that I was going to resign.  Which, as I think back, must have struck him strange.  'Cause people back there didn't resign.  You quit or you got fired.  I told him I wanted to resign, because I wanted to pursue what I'd studied for.  And the thing is--I'm telling you I did all the things.  But the Lord liked me and let me through.  I went in there telling them that I could only work four years.  You know, and then I'll have to follow my chosen field.  Now in most instances, they wouldn't even hire you.  You know.  But I guess the guy must've thought, yeah okay right.  Yeah, you know, you'll resign right.  When I turned in my resignation, the owner of the company that we only saw at Christmas time flew in.  Had a--had all of his department heads, foremans, this big meeting.  I'm the only brother in the meeting.  He thanked me for alerting them of my plans.  He said, "I would like to keep you."  So he offered me a foremanship.  I would be on par with everybody at everybody at this table including my boss.  My immediate boss.  It didn't set too well with him.  Even though we didn't have a--you know.  We got along okay.  But I think he liked the idea of being the boss.  So I said to Mr. Nachmann, I said, "Would you mind if I talked to my wife about this and think it?"  He said, "No I wouldn't expect you to do anything else.  Of course.  Take your time."  So I came home and I said to Barbara--I told her what the situation was.  And asked what she thought.  And her words were something like, "Well honey you've studied for all this time.  Working days and going to school at night and--"  Oh double my salary.  Can't forget that yeah.  It would like be an immediate double salary to what I was getting.  So I told her this.  She said, "Well whatever you decide I'll support you in it.  But you know, that you put a lot into this."  Well that's all I needed really was her support in it.  So I left the job.  I resigned.  No job to go to.  Didn't know how to go about getting into broadcasting.  I went to several radio stations. Couldn't even get to the person that does the hiring.  So I went to WGES [Chicago, Illinois].  'Cause it was all black.  And I went--and I figured, well Sam Evans sounded like a pretty intelligent guy.  I'll see him and ask him. How do I go about getting into broadcasting?  So I went to GES and I spoke with Sam Evans.  And I caught him on a bad night I guess.  I said to him--'cause he didn't stop really to talk to me.  I talk to him on the way to his car.  And I said, "Mr. Evans," I said, "I've been an admirer of yours for some time and I thought maybe you could help me--give me some guidance as to how to get into broadcasting."  And he said, "You want my advice?"  I said, "Yes sir."  I'm hanging on every word.  He said, "Forget this bull and  get yourself a real job."  That's what I was faced with trying to get in.  All that did was make me more determined.  'Cause immediately in my mind I'm saying, wait a minute.  You made it and you're making it."
Story_ID: 5710
Speaker 1: I went to Al Benson who gave me a job.  It was an Al Benson production and Lucky Cordell show.  And I started with I think it was fifteen minutes, or half-hour or something.  It was a short amount of time.  And he put Tom Duncan--Tom Duncan and I like at each other.  It was like these two young men wanna be disk jockeys on the Al Benson program.  Now you send in, I don't know, bottle caps or something.  I think it was Budweiser beer or something.  But he had the audience voting for us by sending in these labels.  And so now the thing is the label of the beer, whatever it was wasn't selling good.  So he was very smart.  He was smart enough to say, how can I jack up the sales? So he didn't care if I had my family and friends go out and buy tons of the stuff.  You know, he didn't care.  All he wanted was the response.  So I won that.  I became the disk jockey.  Then I got a half-hour with him.  Finally got an hour with him.  And I'd say to him, "Mr. Benson I'd really like to get some sponsors."  So he says, "You're not ready yet."  So I was asking, "Can I go out and sell." You know.  'Cause I knew that's where the money was.  Every time I'd ask him, he'd say, "You're not ready."  I saying to myself, how do I get ready?  So he had a newspaper.  And he said to me, "Well you know, I'm not gonna pay you this money for you to do an hour at night."  I said, "Well what--"  He said, "I want you to work at the newspaper office during the day."  Okay so there I was working in the newspaper office during the day and working the radio at night, which meant I had no time to go and get any sponsors.  Benson was not selling at the time.  And he used me and the other young fellow to say to ownership, look, I got these two hotshots in here. They're not selling anything.  Better than me not selling, you know.  So the break came when I--one day I went to work and on my lunch period, I went to a cleaners and sold them an account.  Came back to the newspaper.  And this was when I began to realize what was happening.  I said, "Mr. Benson, good news.  I just sold my first account."  And he went off.  "You did what? I didn't tell you were ready! You're not--"  He says, "You know, you can't sign any contracts because I work for the radio station.  You work for me."  I said, "Yeah I know that.  I didn't sign it."  Then the--you see the light go on over his head.  He said, "Oh maybe you are ready."  He put his signature on it.  Which means he sold it.  Okay?  Then he gave me free reign.  You know, like, you're ready now.  You can go out and sell whatever you want to."  And I must have sold six accounts.  And an account called in.  'Cause one of the accounts that I sold said, "I'll buy this time. But you must do my commercial.  I don't want Benson doing my commercial."  There were some who, because he talked, you know, very--and they wanted somebody that spoke better.  He came in one night feeling good.  He had some guests with him.  He said, "Lucky," he says, "Listen I've got some friends here and you take the night off. I'm gonna do the show."  So he's gonna do my show.  "Okay Mr. Benson."  He did the show and he did the commercial.  The people called up the next day infuriated. "I'm not paying for that commercial.  I told Lucky when he sold me that I was only gonna do--"  Dr. Dyer.  The light went on in his head.  He called me upstairs.  Now this was--he said--sent me a message. Lucky, Dr. Dyer wants to see you."  Benson had threatened me within an inch by saying, "Don't you ever go upstairs. You have no business up there.  Because you work for me."  'Cause he didn't want a closeness between the owners and me.  So here I am. What do I do now?  He said don't go up there and the man who owns the station says he wants to see me. So I took the shot and went on up to see him.  And it went something like, "Lucky you're doing good and I just want to congratulate you.  And listen you've sold several accounts haven't you?"  I said, "Yes sir."  He said, "About how many?"  "Well I don't know five or six."  He said, "Listen I'm looking for my list around here. Can you remember who they were?"  I'm innocent.  I started naming the accounts.  'Cause I didn't know Benson was taking credit and not telling the man that I was involved.  So after that meeting, when I came in that night--I still got the letter.  There was a letter.  Dear Lucky: As of tonight I will no longer need your services.  I will be doing the show myself.  Maybe we can work together in the future. Signed Al Benson.  'Cause I'd gone upstairs.  So the next day, I went up to see Dr. Dyer.  And I said, "Dr. Dyer."  I said, "Is there any time that is available that I can get my own time?  Because Mr. Benson just fired me." He said, "He did what?"  I said, "He said he no longer need my services."  He said, "Well I--you come in tonight to work.  I'll speak with Mr. Benson."  They tell me he cursed him up one wall and down the other.  "You're trying to get rid of this kid whose selling and you're not selling." And blah blah blah.  So then I came in the next night as if I came in to pick up my things.  There was another letter.  Dear Lucky:  I have reconsidered your position as disc jockey and you will continue in your present position for the time being or something.  So I stayed there with him like I say for at least a couple of years.  Finally realizing I can't progress under this man.  Everything I do he's gonna take credit for.  So I put the word out that I was looking.  And it was Leonard Chess who said to me one day when I visited him in his office--Because who would hear about jobs. Record people.  Music people would hear about jobs available.  I was about ready to go out of town.  He said, "Lucky there's a position open in Gary, Indiana.  A little station called WGRY."  Well Gary at that time sounded to me like going to the moon.  I didn't realize it was a stone's throw.  So I thanked him and I did go out there.  I took the audition.  The man liked me.  And I stayed out there for eight years.  And finally I said, I wanna go back to Chicago radio.  That's when I went to Dr. Dyer and he gave me my own show.

Speaker 1: When you got there [Radio Institute of Chicago], what fascinated you about this field?  And then what is the time period that we're operating in? You know, radio was--had been around, you know, was still the most predominant--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So what was--were there people that you liked or, you know, you were exposed to growing up or that influenced you? Or, you know, that even while you were in school, you know, that you were thinking "Oh look at this person or look at that person--"
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I listened to the radio.  But it never--I never thought to myself, I'd like to do that.  It was when I got out of service and went to radio school and sat there and listened to how--I guess the thing that fascinated me was I went in where they were teaching speech. And realized how many words I was not pronouncing properly.  That hooked me.  Then they had a drama class.  And I loved it.  You know, at that time it was not unusual.  They had radio dramas.  They didn't have TV.  You know, lights out and all these different--Ellery Queen.  So that's what interested me.  That's when I took off in that direction.
Story_ID: 5712
Speaker 1: When you went to, you know.  When you went to Al Benson to work with him [at WGES radio, Chicago, Illinois], he was pretty big here, right?
Speaker 2: Big!
Speaker 1: He was big.
Speaker 2: He was super big.
Speaker 1: Now how would you describe Al Benson?  I mean what, you know.  What was he like?  What was his, you know, he was--'Cause I had read something in here that he was even earning 100,000 a year.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) At that time.
Speaker 1: A year, which was--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Big money.
Speaker 1: Unbelievable.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Big money.  Okay to describe Benson.  First of all he professed to have gone to college, which I doubt.  He--but he was a very astute businessman.  Good hustler as we would call him.  He was an ego of the worst sort.  I mean he had an ego as big as the block.  But there will never be another disc jockey that will have the power that that man had in any particular segment.  You know, like there will never be another black man with that kind of power.  He had the kind of power that people like Coke, Pepsi, different national products--if they wanted to get into the black community; they had to go through Al Benson.  That's power.  And he abused it.  I mean he would talk to them like--he called one sponsor up while I was present. He said, "Listen."  I don't remember what the man's name really was.  But he messing up the man's name.  "Chicahokovich?  Al Benson."  "Yes."  "Listen I'm gonna send my man Skeets over there. I want you to give him $500 for me.  I need $500." The man would say, "Well Benson, you know, Al I--." "Don't give me that you don't know stuff.  Now I'm sending him over there, and I want you to give him that money."  And he kept referring to him as "and so-and-so you goddamn Jew."  You know. Oh yeah.  Rough!  And finally he called the man a damned Jew about four times.  And finally the man must have said to him, "Well Al, you know, I could call you something." (laughing)  I could tell from his reaction.  He said, "Oh yeah?  And you better not call me one."  And he sent the man over there.  The man gave him $500 rather than lose him.  I know it hurt him to his heart to give that money to Skeets for him.  But it was good business.  Because when--at the time he could say, "When you go, you tell them that Al Benson sent you."  And people would do that.  You know, they'd go to the store and say, "Al Benson sent me," (laughing), you know, and they would give 'em a little gift or something.  But that was his way of showing his effectiveness.  Every person that walked in there and said, "Al Benson sent me." The client knew, hey Benson is effective.
Speaker 1: So Benson was--he--was he the first or one of--he was one of the first?
Speaker 2: He was one of the first.  Jack L. Cooper, he was the first.  Jack L. was a beautiful guy.  He was an ex-boxer and really quite a gentleman.  And he had--he was on I think it was WHFC [Chicago, Illinois].  I'm not certain of the station.  Now he was there for about eight years before Benson came on the scene.  If Jack would have changed with the times, Benson never could've upset him like that.  Jack would only play jazz and certain artists.  Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington, Nat King Cole like that.  But he wouldn't play blues. Heavy blues.
Story_ID: 5713
Speaker 1: Jack L [Cooper] just refused to play it [blues music].  And I say if he had changed with the times--there was an influx of black people from the South.  And this music was their music.  Music that they were brought up with.  They couldn't hear it on radio.  Al Benson, I told you he was an astute businessman was smart enough to realize there's a void here.  So he went to WGES [radio, Chicago, Illinois], talked to Dr. Dyer who gave him some time.  And--his real name is Arthur Leaner.  He adapted the name Al Benson because as Arthur Leaner, he was a Reverend.  Reverend Arthur Leaner with a church.  Over here he was Al Benson the old swing master.  And the story goes that Benson after he had been on for a while, you know, people could come at the time, visit the studio and look through the glass.  You know, and watch the person work.  So some of his congregation must have talked among themselves and said, "You know, that man sounds so much like Reverend Leaner."  And a few of them agreed.  And then the more they listened, the next few times, "That sounds like Reverend Leaner.  That man sounds too much like Reverend Leaner.  We gotta go down to the studio to visit."  So they went down to the studio, looked through the glass and here's Al Benson jamming, "Y'all's friendly swingmaster, Al Benson."  That's when he became Al Benson period.  No Reverend Leaner any more.  And (laughing) he never stopped moving.  I mean at one time I think he had like six hours allocated to him.  And there were guys working under him in that period.  Sid McCoy, Sam Evans, and a few others.  But it was all his show.  So that's it for Al Benson and Jack L. Cooper.
Story_ID: 5714
Speaker 1: What was the business of radio like also at that time [1950s]?  You know, what was really sort of happening?  It was WGES [radio, Chicago, Illinois] right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the business?  Were people really--was the situation that, I'm a DJ [disc jockey] I can buy time or I'm given time and I split it?  What was the business?  Did I--I went and did my own sales?  You know,  what was--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Okay.  Well see there were several arrangements.  One:  You work for a salary.  Another was you sold your own time, but you had to pay for the time that you were on.  Brokering they called it.  You go and you buy an hour, and then you proceed to sell it.  But you had to hurry up and sell it.  'Cause the time would eat you up.  And [Al] Benson was broke--I don't think he was brokering the time.  I think they gave him this time because there was--radio was not doing anything that heavy with the time.  And they probably gave him a percentage of his sales rather than saddle him with literally buying the time.  A lot of guys tried it.  Very hard to do.  Because when you try, you're an unknown.  And sponsors aren't hardly going to invest their money in an unknown, when they can get somebody that's known.
Speaker 1: And the larger community--see this is what sometimes--you know, you look at nowadays.  The larger community recognized the power of the black market.  They allowed--I mean 'cause I even noticed in the book where, you know, I was looking at the advertisers.  And, you know, people saying, "Thank you," and, you know.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, yeah.  Oh remember now, that was before the advent of television.  So yeah.  They responded.  You were a celebrity.  You know.  And there was the fear when television came out that it was going to kill radio.  I never thought it would.  And it didn't.  Because my thinking was, "You can't--you can't wash the dishes and watch TV.  You can't run a vacuum cleaner and watch TV.  You can't drive a car and watch TV."  I figured there were just too many times when they--if they wanna be entertained radio would be alive.  And when it came in, it shook up a lot of people.  You know, this new medium.  But you can see radio is still going on, and going on strong.  Like they figured FM radio would kill AM. It hasn't.  It curtailed it some.
Story_ID: 5715
Speaker 1: Your experience with Al Benson, you were sort of disappointed with that.  Sort of.  Was it?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Well because he could have been a mentor in a way.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) And, you know,  I always try to--excuse me Julie.  I always try to give him credit for being the one that gave me my first break.  I give him that in interviews or whenever I write or whatever.  Because that's so.  But I am smart enough to know why he gave me the opportunity, and how he used me.  And when he fired me, it was on Christmas Eve.  And I had to--I didn't even let Barbara [Browning Cordell] know.  I waited 'til the holidays were all over.  I didn't wanna spoil her Christmas.  Fired me on Christmas Eve from the newspaper.  So it wasn't--
Speaker 1: From the newspaper!
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, I told you I was working at the station during the night--
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 2: --and working at his newspaper during the day.
Speaker 1: He had a newspaper!
Speaker 2: He had a newspaper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he had a newspaper.  He had his radio time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well see, who was writing for the newspaper?
Speaker 2: He had a staff.  What happened he bought a newspaper from someone.
Speaker 1: What was it called?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether it was the 'Crusader'?  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Was it the 'Crusader'?  That was what Gus Savage ended up owning.  I thought Gus Savage founded the 'Crusader'.
Speaker 2: You know, I'm really not certain.  I don't wanna give you wrong information.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But he might have made a success of that if he had left it alone.  You know, he was not a newspaper person.  Let the people who are newspaper people do their job.  He was in there interfering.  And there's a story that gives you an idea about the man.  He wanted to fire the editor.  'Cause they had--they clashed on ideas.  'Cause the editor was like, "Mr. Benson, let me do this.  I know how to do this for you."  That kind of thing.  So Benson had decided he wanted to get rid of him.  So he called a meeting of the staff in his office.  We're all there.  And his right arm Skeets Vans.  Skeets was like his man Friday, Saturday, Sunday and the rest of the days included.  Skeets did not work at the newspaper.  He was just like a runner.  He ran errands for him and did like that.  Go buy his booze.  So we were all in there.  And he said, "Listen, I'm considering dismissing Mr. So-and-so.  I would like to know how you feel about it?  Do you think this is a mistake?  Now we're gonna have a secret ballot."  So he got all these little pieces of paper.  "Skeets, pass these out."  He says, "Now I want you to put but one word on there.  Go or stay."  So everybody figures it's a secret ballot right?  Nobody wanted the man to go.  So when he got the slips back, he said, "Okay.  Stay, stay, stay, go."  And he said, "Skeets, what did you vote?"  And Skeets said, "Al, you said it was gonna be a secret ballot I--"  "Listen forget that.  How did you vote?"  "I voted go."  "You're the only one with any sense.  So the rest of your are fired."  (pause) Cleaned house.  Try to start all over again.  When he got rid of that editor, he lost his newspaper.  'Cause he wasn't a newspaper person.  All that experience he tried to, you know.  And with all the money that he made he died broke.  He died broke.  Because he lived so high.  And he had a couple of big cars.  He must have had fifty suits.  He had a couple of lady friends that he was taking good care of.  He had a wife.  He had a home.  He had, you know.  As if the money would last forever.  And it ran out.  When he--they offered him--oh he was gonna quit when the station [WGES radio, Chicago, Illinois] was sold.  Because they  didn't want him to do the programming any more.  This was when McCLindon [Radio Corporation] bought the station.  And he wanted a clean sound.  He wanted an updated approach and Benson didn't fit it.  But he said to Benson, "Mr. Benson, we'd really like to keep you on the team.  If you would just head up our sales department--" Remember he's got all the contacts.  "You head up our sales department and we'll pay you $100,000 a year."  "You must be out of your mind.  I make that off of one account."  You know. He said, "Well now Mr. Benson--."  Long story short, he--his ego wouldn't let him accept it.  So they moved on.  They got somebody else to do it and he never got back in power.  That was it.  He had had his shot.  And they'll never be another with that kind of power.  I mean all the politicians they kow-towed to him.  They needed him.  An endorsement from Benson was like a big deal.  You know.  So that's my Benson story.
Speaker 1: Did you learn anything from him that stood you in good stand in your career?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No.
Story_ID: 5716
Speaker 1: When you left--okay, you got recruited right?  Or you left.
Speaker 2: To go to Gary [Indiana].
Speaker 1: To Gary.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I left because I couldn't have my own show I was like--At a whim he'd [Al Benson] come in and take over the show and do the show.  And he was taking credit for the commercials that I sold.  So I just figured, this is the--you know, I need to be out of this.  And that's what I say.  He fired me on Christmas Eve and that's when I was shopping around for a job.  And I spoke--I went to see Leonard Chess.  And he said to me about WGRY in Gary.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now now--this is a new experience in many--I mean in many ways.  Had you spent any time in Gary or knew anybody?
Speaker 2: (shakes head for no) Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is let's see.  This is 1950--1960--'54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so talk about that.  But you've been doing things.  And the format, the structure was the same thing? Did you--
Speaker 2: Well the experience that I took with me--remember Gary was a booming town, but it was a small town.  And not too many of your top flight jocks [disc jockeys] would go to Gary if they could go somewhere else.  So me leaving, being a Chicago jock, going to Gary and taking a sound and a presentation totally different, a more up tempo, [snapping fingers], you know.  That's what made, I guess, my show more interesting.  And there were two disc jockeys there.  Well there were three.  Eddie Honesty was in Hammond, Indiana [at WJOB radio], nice guy Eddie. Vivian Carter and Jessie Coopwood were in Gary and they owned the town.  And I went in and went to speak to each of them to say, "Look, if you'll just give me a list of the accounts that you have, I won't call on them to try to sell them."  Vivian did this.  Jesse, who recently passed, who became a good friend.  But at the time I was like an ant to him.  You know.  He made the statement--he took me to lunch.  And he said, "Lucky, you got a nice presentation."  He said, "And you should do all right."  He said, "But the only thing standing in your way is me."  Whoa!  But he didn't stand there too long.  At one point, this is not bragging.  This is a fact.  I owned the town.  It was mine.  They ran--they had a thing called Mayor of Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois].  That's supposed to be the most popular person, whether it's a businessman, politician, preacher, radio person.  Anybody that is of note.  And I won it four years thumbs down and finally refused to run.  And the guy that owned my station--owned WGRY--really didn't want me to run.  'Cause he didn't have the confidence that I could win.  So he--he wouldn't let me run.  The people liked me well enough to write me in as a contract--write me in as a candidate.  That's how I won the first time.  After that, he was pleased to have me run.  So after four years, I declined to run any more.  You know.  Vivian Carter went on to form Vee-Jay Record Company.  She and her husband Jimmy [Bracken] and her brother [Calvin Carter] formed Vee-Jay Record Company, and it did real good.  I'm trying to think of the brother's name.  It doesn't come right away.  They had at one time an opportunity to sell the operation for $2 million.  They built it from scratch.  They could've gotten--or was it $3 million.  I think it was $3 million.  'Cause it was one for her, one for Jimmy and one for her brother.  And they refused.  And eventually, they lost it.  They lost it.  Jimmy died, the brother died.  She, I don't know.  For lack of a better explanation, but she drank too much, and died in a nursing home.  And Vivian was not that much--I think she was my peer.  She was around my age.  So that was sad.  You know.  But Gary was a--at the time I was there, Gary was a jamming town.  Well you had all the steel mills in operation.  Money was flowing like water.  If you had any hustle about yourself, you could make it in Gary.  But, of course, today, it's a ghost town.
Speaker 1: And that whole experience--I mean that was a very stark contrast to what you had experienced.  You know, what you had just come out of. But now what I'm wondering, you know, you had a show called 'House of Hits'.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I want you to talk about what--why that show was called that.  Was it the top hits?  You know.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or did you--?
Speaker 2: I called it the 'House of Hits'.  I named it that.  That gave the illusion that I played all the hits. But I was much more than that.  The thing that really sold my show was I did things like--like I had something called the 'Poetry Corner'.  I'd just read poems to music background--music background. I had a program where you sell things.  What was the name of it?  Exchange--'Airwaves Exchange'.  Now that meant if you have something you'd like to sell, I would put it on the air.  And this is not commercial.  Not stores.  Gotta be individuals.  If there's something that you wanna buy, I'd put that on the air.  So it brought people together.  Like for instance, I'd say, "You'd get in touch with me.  Send me a letter."  And you say, "I have a bedroom suite that I'd like to sell.  My daughter's moved out and we no longer need this suite--this suit."  And then I'd put that on the air.  And somebody would get in touch with you who wanted to buy one.  So it was very popular.  I mean I only had--I only did it for about fifteen minutes a day.  And there were tons of responses that I couldn't do.  Yes, I played the hits.  But I mixed 'em up.  I played the current stuff.  And remember the experience with Al. I played the blues.  I even played Elvis Presley.  I mean a few of the white artists that I was impressed with Elvis Presley--what was the boy's name that played piano?  The names don't come easily.  Jerry Lewis. Jerry Lee Lewis.  And a few--a couple others that I played.  They were mixed in.  But that's about--I guess what I'm saying is I tried to do something different other than just play records, you know.  And it worked.
Story_ID: 5717
Speaker 1: I wanted to, you know to--you coming to WVON [radio, Chicago, Illinois].  I wanted to talk about the Skyloft Players, and, you know, your acting, 'cause I--.
Speaker 2: Well, that's where I met my wife.  Barbara [Browning Cordell] appeared in a play and we were husband and wife.  And we've been playing that role ever since (laughing) about fifty-one years now.  It was--now that was a beautiful experience in our lives.  We made a lot of good friends and it was just fun.  I mean it was really a fun thing to do the drama.
Speaker 1: Now there is--just one other thing about Skyloft.  You know, you always hear about the American Negro Theater [Harlem, New York], and Chicago [Illinois] had Skyloft Players.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I was just wondering if you could tell a little bit about the theater troupe, and even the name of the play that your wife--you know, where you met your wife.
Speaker 2: Now what--I know we played 'Wuthering Heights'.  We did 'Dark of the Moon'.  The play that I met Barbara in, I'm trying to think of the name of it.  And it escapes me for the moment.  But like one of the girls in the group, Margie McGlory (ph.), she went on to Europe and was doing very well in Europe, as a singer.  She--the stage--the acting helped her in her singing presentation.  Donald Julian was the director.  He--We're still in touch.  We're still in touch with Margie.  Donald is in New York where he taught at a university.  Who else?  Oh Curly Ellison was an artist.  Tremendous talent.  But he died.  Before he died, of course, he got on drugs.  And it did something to him physically where they had to amputate, you know.  And he was paralyzed in his right arm.  Which he was right handed.  You should see some of the work he trained himself to do with his left hand.  Just amazing.  You know.  If you can imagine, you're right handed.  And you don't have this.  You gotta do this.  I mean some of the work he did was just phenomenal.  We went to visit him a number of times in the nursing home.  Who else was there?  Ray Stubbs (ph.) was there.  And he went on to become a Shakespearean actor.  I don't know what Ray is doing now.  Who else was there?  Well several of the people have passed.  I can't think of any--
Speaker 1: Now where was it located?  Where was it housed on?
Speaker 2: It was on King Drive and 51st [Street], right on the corner.
Speaker 1: And you--how does it differ from black theater?  It was the--you did a lot of white productions really at Skyloft.  Was there anything such as black--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No.
Speaker 1: It wasn't.
Speaker 2: Because what we did was like for instance we would take a play and change the name and do it basically the same play.  I'm trying to think of--was 'Wuthering Heights'--that was--'hat was one we did with the real names.  But we were a little theater group practically no money.  We couldn't afford to pay for the rights to do the play.  'Cause they charge you--they don't have a special rate.  They just charge you their rate.  We wouldn't've made enough to keep the group going.  'Cause nobody got paid.  It was all used for the organization.  And--well.
Speaker 1: Do you know how it ended, or how long it lasted?
Speaker 2: I honestly don't know. I know this.  After our group, it continued to feed.  It began--continued to grow.  But I really don't know how long it lasted.  There was a--I think there were only--there were three groups at the time.  Three different groups. And I played with two of them.  And I just can't remember the names.

Speaker 1: Back in Gary [Indiana], just one thing.  You became so popular that you--.  The--with the--what?  The newspapers called you the honorary mayor of the Negro community.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And you won that for many--you know--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) For four years.  Four years running.  And I never really promoted it [on WGRY radio, Gary, Indiana].  It was like, once I won, and a lot of the people were out hustling to get people to vote for them.  And I didn't do that.  But I tell you something that I did do.  And I told my wife [Barbara Browning Cordell] I was gonna do this.  I told her, I said, "In four years, it's gonna be my town."  And she said, "What are you talking about?  You got Jimmy [Bracken]--you got Vivian Carter and--" I said, "Well I got a plan."  For the first year, for the whole year, I went to all the churches.  A different church every Sunday, and all during the week I went to the churches.  Oh I had a half hour religious music too.  Then the next time, I went to all of the social functions.  Then the next year, and I mean I have 'em in order.  I went to all of the things put on by the clubs.  You know, going to the lounges.  And what was the fourth one?  I can't even remember the fourth one.  But there were four groups that I wanted to get to know me.  And I had this--this is a funny story.  I had this religious program.  And when I was the 'Baron of Bounce', you know, and I was up-tempo (snaps fingers) and kicking.  And then there'd be some commercials.  And the music would come on soft and I would play the religious music.  And there was a lady that listened to the religious music.  She didn't listen to the rock and roll.  And I went to this church to visit.  And they introduced me. And I talked for a bit.  And as I was coming down, this lady--this elderly lady was coming towards me.  She said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  You know you're not Lucky Cordell."  I said, "But I am (laughing)."  But see she only listened to the gospel.  You see.  And I, of course, toned it down.  And so hearing--she just didn't believe me.  You know.  But that was funny.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you one more question about Gary [Indiana].  When you go there [to WGRY radio, Gary, Indiana], did you learn--or was there any difference between that market and the Chicago [Illinois] market?  You know, in terms of the people?  Or was that not even relevant? Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what made you leave there?  Since you was--oh!  The other thing--'Baron of Bounce'.  Why Baron of Bounce?  Was that a name you sort of gave yourself?
Speaker 2: (nods for yes) Well I did because, you know, you had Nat King Cole.  You had Count Basie.  You had, you know, all this royalty.  So I became a Baron.
Speaker 1: And so--and that name took hold.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did that name just follow you when you came to--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 5720
Speaker 1: What made you decide to leave [WGRY radio station, Gary, Indiana] since you were sort of the king of the mountain?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you.  The man who owned the station, George Whitney, he was a nice old guy.  But that's what he was, an old guy.  And he would say to me on occasions--like one time when I went to him about more money, that's--at one point,  I was worth--what the girl tell me?  I was worth 60 percent of the station's income.  In other words, I was bringing in 60 percent of the money to that station.  And I went to him and said, "Mr. Whitney, I haven't had a raise in two years.  You know, I would really like to have a raise."  And he said to me, "Jesus kid!  You're making a lot more money than I made when I was your age."  I didn't know how to respond at the time.  But I thought about it later.  When he was my age, of course he didn't make the money that I was making.  You know what I'm saying.  He was in broadcasting at the time.  But we're talking thirty years before, you know.  So he refused to give me the money.  And I said to him, "Well sir, I just want you to know that I'm going to resign.  But I'll give you time to get my replacement, and I'll break 'em in."  I said, "So I'm giving you two months to find my replacement."  "Yeah gee okay.  Right, okay."  The man didn't believe me.  Two weeks before I was--see now by this time, I've already lined myself up at WGES [radio station, Chicago, Illinois].  So it's not a question.  I mean I've got to go.  Two or three weeks before I said to him, "Mr. Whitney, did you find my replacement now--yet?"  He says, "No I didn't find your replacement."  So two weeks before, I said, "Mr. Whitney, I'm leaving in two weeks."  He said, "Geez! Were you serious!"  I said--he said, "I'll give you the damn raise.  Damn it!"  You know.  I said, "It's too late."  "Well what do you mean by that?"  "I've already--I'm assigned another job in two weeks.  I gave you two months."  "Jesus H Christ!  I didn't know you were serious."  So I said, "Well try to get someone as fast as you can.  I'll break 'em in.  I'll take 'em around and introduce 'em to the clients.  I'll show 'em whatever I was doing here to help 'em out."  So sure enough, the two weeks passed.  He didn't find a replacement for me.  One of the people who worked there just kind of sat in 'til he could find somebody.  He never did find somebody.  And he took me to lunch and he said, "Geez kid!  I just want you to know you were the best thing that ever happened to this radio station.  And if it doesn't work out for you in the big city, come on back.  You always got a home here in Gary."  You know.  Of course, I never--but that's how I got back to Chicago.  That's when I made the deal with WGES for my own time.
Speaker 1: And at this time when you come back, Al Benson is gone.  Is he still there?
Speaker 2: No.  He's still there.
Speaker 1: He's still there at WGES.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But not with the power.  By that time you got Sid McCoy with his own show.  Sam Evans had his own show.  In other words, this time--six or eight hours, I don't know exactly what, that was allocated to him initially--anybody that wanted to work there had to come under him.  But they had--he was no longer selling enough to keep eight hours.  So they broke it off.  He probably had at that time three hours.  You know.
Speaker 1: And you worked there at WGES, that was in 1961.  Right?
Speaker 2: (nods for yes) Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 5721
Speaker 1: What was happening just generally, you know, in the black community or with black music?
Speaker 2: Okay.  The doo-wop, the blues.  It was really--that was at time when you could really mix the music up.  You could play Billie Holliday.  You could play the Ravens.  And you could play the Howling Wolf or Muddy Waters.  You could mix it up.  There was like you had enough audience for all.  But you had to play the majority of the blues.  'Cause that's what made the station.  That's what made Al Benson.  But there were enough people out there who were sophisticated enough to accept a different kind of music as well.
Speaker 1: And were you--so what was the lineup?  Can you tell me between you, Sid McCoy and Al Benson what was the time (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Let's see. That would be difficult for me.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: Because Sid wasn't--pardon me.  Sid and I weren't there at the same time.  Sid had left before I came.  Sam Evans was there.  Ric Ricardo was there.  Franklin McCarthy was there, I was there and that's--McKee Fitzhugh was there.  But I think Sid--no, I take that back.  Sid was still there.  Take that back.  He went on pretty soon after that.  He didn't stay there that long.  I think he left there and went to WCFL [radio station, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 5722
Speaker 1: Now how did you get recruited to WVON [radio station, Chicago, Illinois]?  Or what was--how did that--that happened in 1964?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But what happened?  Was it that Chess--when did [Leonard] Chess buy the--I mean how did that even happen?  The always--let me see.  I think Chess Records--okay.
Speaker 2: See it used to be two stations sharing that frequency.  There was WHFC [radio station, Chicago, Illinois] and another station sharing the same frequency.  In other words, you had from twelve to five and I have from five to, you know.  Like that.  That's the way it was when Leonard bought it.  But then he applied and got twenty-four-hour license.  The way I came in, when I worked at WGES [radio station, Chicago, Illinois] and it was bought by the McClindon [Radio] Corporation, they came in and they played the same type of music that we'd been playing.  But they mixed it up with a lot of pop things.  You see.  And it was going fine.  Then they got greedy.  And they said, hey, we got this much--we got the--we're using black disc jockeys.  So we automatically got the blacks locked up.  And so we can go and play more pop stuff.  And I mean they were playing the poppest of the pop.  It wasn't like, you know.  There's an in-between pop.  So while they were doing this back and forth thing, changing the ratio of the music, a little station on the bank of a river opened up called WVON.  Playing all black music, all disc jockeys twenty-four hours a day.  So 'GES could not--Well it became WYNR [radio station, Chicago, Illinois], winner.  They could not compete with that.  In other words, over here you've got WBBM [radio station, Chicago, Illinois], WJ--WJJD [radio station, Chicago, Illinois].  You've got stations locked in on the pop market.  Now here's Leonard and these guys over here at WVON locked to the black market.  So there wasn't enough left for them.  So they thought they'd go all news.  And they were the only all news station in Chicago at the time.  So they became W-news [WNUS, radio station, Chicago, Illinois].  From WY--WGES, WYNR, WNUS.  So I stayed on with the news format.  They maintained me.  But I was not happy being away from music.  And it was during that period, around that time when Leonard contacted me and said he would like me to come to work for him."
Speaker 1: Now who were--who was there when you came on--of the DJ's?
Speaker 2: Okay.  There was Rodney Jones, McKee Fitzhugh, Ric Ricardo, Franklin McCarthy (pause). Who else was there?  Isabel [Joseph] Johnson.  She was the religious director.  And was Bill 'Doc'--yeah, Bill 'Doc' Lee.  Now those are the ones that I can recall.
Story_ID: 5723
Speaker 1: First of all Leonard Chess, just talk a little bit about him.  What kind of person was he?
Speaker 2: Well I loved the man.  You will find that he had detractors and, you know.  But everybody's experience is different with people.  He respected me.  He helped me.  And obviously, he had a lot of confidence in me to move me to his organization like he did.  From disc jockey to assistant program director, to program director, assistant manager and to general manager.  Now this is--you'll find interesting.  When Leonard was selling the station, Leonard was not well. He had a bad heart.  He finally had a heart attack.  He was getting ready to sell the station [WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois].  He died before the sale was complete.  But it was enough in motion to carry it on.  He asked me one day.  He said, "Lucky what are you doing this afternoon for lunch?"  I said, "Nothing really."  He said, "I want you to meet me over at Bats.  We'll have lunch together."  I said, "Okay."  And he said, "I wanted you to hear it from me first.  I'm selling the station."  "Yeah?"  He said, "Yeah.  But don't worry.  You'll be okay.  'Cause part of the deal is that they keep you as general manager. That's locked in."  So I thanked him.  And he said, "And I'm going to do something for you to show you my appreciation for your friendship and your loyalty throughout the years."  I said, "Well Leonard, you've always been good to me."  You know.  I said, "you gave me $2,000 bonus--Christmas."  Listen to the words.  He said, "That was nothing."  So the man died before he was able to do what he was planning to do for me.  If 2,000 was nothing, ten twenty thousand?  He was a multi-multimillionaire.  The man was rich.  So I have no idea what he really intended to do for me.  And the end of it came when his brother, who was not like him, came into my office, and he was like writing up the various things that were in there.  And--"How you doing Phil?"  He says, "Ah, I'm okay.  I'm so damn tired of people coming to me telling me what Leonard was gonna do for them."  Now I can't possibly say anything now.  He just, you know.  Leonard may have told him I'd like to do this--I'm gonna do this for Lucky.  I'm gonna give him X amount.  So he comes in and tells me that everybody is telling him what Leonard was gonna do for 'em.  So now what can I say?  "Well hey!  He was gonna do something for me too."  You know.  So I left it. So I never--and I will always wonder what he was going to do.  We never had a problem.  Never had an argument, never been called on the carpet.  What else?  What else?  Leonard had a lot of confidence in me in terms of he would like me to be with him like if he had to--if he had to make a personal appearance and speak.  He felt better if I was with him.  And sometimes he'd go up and speak.  And he wasn't bad.  You know, he was not--he was really kind of a shy guy.  He would come down and he'd sit next to me.  And he say, "How was it?" and I'd say, "You did great."  And he'd say, "Bullshit."  You know, in other words he couldn't even accept the compliment.  He was an introvert.  And he was a hands-on person.  Like when we worked in Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois] raising funds for NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], Urban League or [Operation] PUSH.  And we were putting like bumper stickers on cars.  You drive in get a bumper sticker, 'VON bumper sticker and make your contribution.  Here's this millionaire out there putting bumper stickers on.  Leonard Chess!  He's out there with the rest of us, stopping cars putting bumper stickers on.  He didn't have to come to the radio station at all.  Because he was making the money.  The station was, you know.  The management level was everything then.  But he was out there every week.  At least once a week he was out there.  And I admired that about him.  But he--as I say, he had a heart problem.  And it finally got to him. His brother sold the station and moved to Arizona where he's now raising horses or something.
Speaker 1: So his brother's still alive then.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: How old do you think he is then?
Speaker 2: Well okay.  I would say that Phil might be--I'm seventy-three.  Phil might be seventy-eight, you know what I'm saying.  He wasn't that much older.
Story_ID: 5724
Speaker 1: You know, what I found also between Vee-Jay Records and, you know, between Chess Records, was it a common sort of thing where people would have a record company and then try to own a radio station?  Own their own radio station?
Speaker 2: No.  No that was--that's really a first.  In other words, I don't know of any other case where a record company went on to own a radio station.
Speaker 1: So that's a pretty powerful combination.  I mean. I mean it--your-with art--I mean you have artists.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Would the artists--was there anything  about, "Well play these artists the most."  And was there--there wasn't anything.
Speaker 2: No.  He [Leonard Chess] honestly didn't do that.  He hustled his records [from Chess Records] with us [at WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois] the same way the other record promoters hustled them.  And he--because of the FCC [Federal Communications Commission], we could only play so much of his stuff.  So we just put it down so they were locked in.  You could only play so many of his records, however, you played them.  Or, you know.  I think it was something like five or six of his records during the course of the day.  Now at the end of the week, you might pull this one off and put another one on.  You know.  But he never--I never had him say to me, "Play this record."  You know.
Story_ID: 5725
Speaker 1: Now tell me.  I'd love to hear some sort of anecdotal stories of your time there.  You know, because this was a unique sort of collection of people that gathered together [at WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was indeed. We had a guy there named the Magnificent Montague.  I think they imported Montague from California.  He was one of the last to come aboard.  And Montague (laughs) was really a nice guy.  I mean he liked me.  I liked him.  But he was an ego.  And he would tell the other jocks how he was gonna bury them, and what he was gonna do.  You know.  And finally, he got a box wrapped up like it was a box of candy.  And he was saying to the other guys, "I don't see you getting any presents from listeners.  One of my listeners has sent me a box--a present here."  You know, he was just going on.  And he opened the box.  And he had manure in it.  And it said, "You're full of--" you know (laughing).  And, of course,  the place came up--I mean just fell apart.  You know.  I always thought maybe one of the jocks did that.  You know, I could never figure a listener doing that, you know.  That seems like something that somebody would do to somebody who is just a braggart.  But it was funny.
Story_ID: 5726
Speaker 1: We didn't--most of us didn't socialize a lot.  But we had a very close-knit family there [WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois].  When I was promoted--I'm maybe getting further ahead than you want.  But when I was promoted to general manager, and then--well then they wanted to make a change.  Then they promoted me to assistant to the president of the whole corporation [Globetrotter Communications].  That was Rody Boat Company, Rod Sheet and Tenmill, the Atlanta Braves, the Harlem Globetrotters.  I mean this was a big corporation.  I was gonna be assistant to the president.  They owned seven radio stations.  But see they wanted to take back control of their radio station.  And I wasn't going along with some of the changes they wanted to make.  So they wanted to get somebody in there who would do their bidding.  And how do we do this?  Well, he's too strong in the community for us to fire him.  We'll promote him out.  We'll promote him up.  Give him a desk, two secretaries and a big title.  And more money. So they did it all.  So that a person couldn't say, "Well look, you know, they just did this."  In this living room all the disc jockeys came and said, "Lucky, give us the word.  We'll walk."  And I said, "Well I appreciate that.  And I'll never forget it.  But you can't walk.  Why would you be walking?"  They said, "We know that, you know, they've taken the title from you," and blah-blah.  I said, "Yes, that's true.  But they were smart enough to cover themselves.  They promoted me.  They gave me more money."  So I'm saying that to say that's how close we were.  That they were willing to put their jobs on the line for me.  So I said to them, "Look, there's nothing you can do there.  Go back to your job.  Do your job the best you can."  I said, "But they will come for you one at a time.  Be ready for that.  That's when you walk.  That's when you stand up for each other."  And that's what they did.  They picked them off one at a time, replacing them with new guys.
Story_ID: 5727
Speaker 1: But this original group, you guys [at WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois] were sort of a special--there were some magical things happening, you know, with the community and being active, similar to what you experienced really in Gary [Indiana, at WGRY radio statoin].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So you said, you know, you brought over the exchange thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that was popular.  You were talking about the babysitting.
Speaker 2: Well that's what caused a problem, really.  We were contacted by the Health Department.  And they said, "You don't know what kind of home you're advertising for these kids to be sitting in."  And you know.  "So you have to discontinue that."  And the automobile dealers put a lot of pressure on those who were advertising with us.  Because at first, I was selling cars.  You know.  As long as it wasn't a dealer.  Well automobile dealers got together and said, "Hey!  You're competing with us."  You know.  So I had to stop that.  So finally I just--I gave it up.  It did what I wanted it to do.  It got my foot in the door.  It drew attention.
Story_ID: 5728
Speaker 1: Now what other anecdotes or stories, you know, saying these are humorous things that happened?  Or, you know, things that were maybe problems at the station [WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois]?  Or--.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'll be very honest with you.  There were no problems.  I'm telling you.  It was like a family. I can't think of any thing where we had like--I'll tell you, as long as I was GM [general manager]. I never fired anybody.  I only had to jack a couple of the guys up once.  It was just a harmonious group.
Story_ID: 5729
Speaker 1: Let's see you got there [WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois] in '64 [1964].  And then you became--six years later became general manager.  In that time, why do you think you were picked?  Were you like the most responsible?  Or, you know.
Speaker 2: You mean for the position? Okay I think Leonard [Chess] was impressed--I was pretty methodical.  I was perhaps one of the only guys, I'll say it, that came to work with a show already prepared, laid out.  I could give a copy to the engineer.  He didn't have--I didn't have to inbetween records tell him what record to play.  He's got his list there.  He can stack his music.  I didn't have to spend my time trying to figure.  I could be clever inbetween my records.  'Cause my records were already lined up.  I could--I didn't have to try to decide at the last minute--while the records playing what I'm going to play.  I think that was one of the things that impressed him.  When he made me music director, I demanded that the guys do the same.  They had to come prepared with the music.  I don't know what else really.  Other than the fact that I--I was never late.  We had what they called a production schedule, where you stay after work and do commercials.  I was always there for that.  In other words, I was never a problem.  And I--believe me.  I never worked to please a boss.  My whole life, I worked to please me.  Because I always felt, "If I please me, you're gonna be pleased if you're the boss."  So I never had to jump when the boss came around.  I was always doing my job.
Story_ID: 5730
Speaker 1: Well the Negro History Week.  Or Black History Week.  Would that--would that be a short response, not long?
Speaker 2: Well I can make a short response.  I produced a whole series of black history that was used on the radio stations.  It was used in some schools to teach black history.  And it really drew attention to the station [WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois].  I mean the research, I didn't do the research.  Can't take credit for that.  Some college students did the research.  The research must have stood that high in papers.  But I produced it.  I got the actors together, the actresses.  I had everybody at that radio station on this production.  The people who were putting--who were putting up the money had been so ripped.  I mean the people had really taken advantage of 'em.  'Til they had very little money left to produce this.  So in order for me not to hire a lot of actors and actresses, I used the station personnel.  And they each made a little money, you know.  Brought it in pretty close to budget.  So that's the story.
Story_ID: 5731
Speaker 1: When they [Globetrotter Communications] had decided to promote me out of the position of general manager [of WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois], they at the same time had spoken to Bernadine [C. Washington] about her being my replacement.  And they had also without her knowledge promised Joe Cobb that they were gonna make him the general manager.  It turns out that they said to him--they set him up to be a liar.  Because if you say to somebody, "Hey, if we get rid of this person, you're gonna have the position."  So then you start looking for ways to get rid of this person.  So he told some lies, which were later, proven.  But it--it's been a long time since something hurt me that much.  Because I brought him in.  I hired him.  He was my morning DJ [disc jockey].  He had the best position, and he did a fabulous job.  Got nothing against his work.  But he had Cecil Hale, the two youngest guys they were my young Turks.  College grads.  I had big hopes for them.  So I knew somebody was leaking information or telling stuff.  When I get a call from George Gillette who was then the--what was his--president.  "Good morning.  Yeah, Lucky, listen, this is George."  "Yeah George."  "Why was the switchboard operator late today?"  I said, "She was late because she missed her bus and she doesn't drive.  But the switchboard was opened on time by one of the other ladies."  "Well you have to sit on top of this.  You know, you can't let these people get away with" blah-blah.  So now I'm knowing for him to know that's fifteen minutes ago, that the switchboard operator was late, somebody had to call him.  And there were a few instances like that, which made, you know.  It makes you wonder who's doing this, you know.  And I would rather the guilty person get away, than accuse a person who is innocent.  So he wrote a letter, which they gave to me.  Wherein, he accused the disc jockeys of using drugs on the air.  I was floored.  This was like to say to them, look, you gotta get rid of this manager.  He's not on top of things.  You see.  So his greatest disappointment was when they gave Bernadine the general manager's position.  They took him off being a disc jockey.  They tried to make him quit.  Took him off being a disc jockey and put him in the newsroom.  The man was a fabulous jock.  They put him in a newsroom, which was like foreign to him.  He was not a newsperson.  But the final blow was when a news director's position came open, he thought he was gonna get that.  They gave it to a--they gave it to a young lady, much younger than he was.  She was his boss.  He couldn't take it.  He couldn't take that.  So he tried to make them fire him by not coming, coming late and this kind of thing.  I don't know how it finally ended.  But he became very unhappy.  They were unhappy with him.  And finally he was gone.  They've since tried to bring him back and put him in the same position, early morning.  But we've all missed our prime time.  You know.  I mean he just--I listened to him.  And I listened with an unprejudiced ear to see if he could still jam.  The fire was not there.  That boy used to be so good on the air.  He and Cecil.  Wildcats.  But he'd lost it.  So it didn't last long. They promoted him to death for about two months.  "Joe Cobb is coming back!  Joe Cobb is coming back."  By two months, he was gone.
Story_ID: 5732
Speaker 1: Now what about Herb Kent?  Your Herb Kent story.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Herb, we refer to Herb as the world's oldest teenager.  Because he's like a pied piper.  He has the ability (laughs).  Who would come up with something crazy like the Wahoo Man?  Who would even think of that?  He had mothers calling us saying, "You gotta stop Herb from talking about that Wahoo Man.  It's scaring my kids!"  You know.  But it was drawing attention to the show.  And when he left the Wahoo Man, he'd go to something else.  There again, like I said, never had a problem with Herb.  And Herb and I--Herb started in radio around the same time I did.  And he--I don't know whether I mentioned or not.  He was at 'VON [WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois].  He was one of the people there  originally, when I was naming them.  I don't know whether I mentioned him or not, but he was there.

Speaker 1: [E.] Rodney [Jones] and Herb [Kent] were in a contest together.  Now this was a station [WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois] promotion.  It was the same kind of thing that had been done many stations--many times.  Send in a label and vote for your favorite DJ [disc jockey].  Now this was all the disc jockeys.  And that gave them the opportunity of hyping saying, "Vote for me."  You know.  "Hey, you know, I'm in this contest.  Vote for me."  So Herb and Rodney were the closest.  They were the leaders.  Everybody else had fallen behind.  And there was a guy who was a sponsor of Herb Kent's who pulled a truck.  He owned a grocery store.  He pulled a truck up in the lot and had two people in there ripping off labels, gonna vote for Herb Kent.  Well Herb Kent won it thumbs down.  I mean the man unloaded half a truck of labels.  To show you how people get involved.  Here he is a sponsor.  He wanted the one that he was pulling for to win.  'Cause Herb did his commercials.  The story goes that he was like a lightweight gangster.  And one day Rodney was called into the office.  And this guy had--he was a little guy.  But he had two big guys with him.  Oh--the reason he wanted to see Rodney was Rodney jokingly made fun of the fact that Herb Kent had stolen the, you know.  "He didn't really beat me.  But he stole the election. " You know.  And that was like calling this guy's representatives a thief.  He came out there.  He said, "And don't you ever call me--say I'm crooked!"  Pow! Fired on him.  And Leonard was there.  And it was hushed up.  It never was, you know, never known.  I'll tell you who the guy was.  He was the guy that later was busted for--he had a plant.  And they were wrapping--they were putting butter wrappers on margarine.  It was really margarine.  And they had a plant doing it.  So naturally, he could undersell any store in town.  Butter, you know, so much a pound.  They caught up with him in his operation.  They busted that.  So there were a couple of things that, you know, were a little shady about the boy.  And nobody ever knew that.  That's really--because, you know, that's the kind of story--who's gonna tell it?  Have him coming after you, you know.

Speaker 1: [Bill] 'Butterball' [Crane] loved to ride motorcycles.  He was a motorcyclist.  He loved it.  He was racing and doing everything.  Until he took a real bad spill.  And just peeled the skin.  You know, like he slid along the concrete.  So he stopped racing then.  'Cause he used to do acrobatics, and you know.  He was really--I'm telling you.  For him to be a preacher today just blows my mind.  Because he was--he was the wild one.  [E.] Rodney [Jones] and I fished together a lot.  He loved fishing also.  Franklin McCarthy passed.  Ric Ricardo left.  And I've heard since that he had passed.  McKee Fitzhugh passed.  McKee Fitzhugh used to have a lounge on 63rd [Street] and King Drive [Chicago, Illinois].  It was very popular.  It was a small place, but very popular.  By him being a disc jockey, he could entice.  Now that's--he was right down the street from the Persian Ballroom--Persian Hotel.  So that's where all of your major artists stayed when they came to town.  So they could come over and make an appearance at his club.  Not to perform, just be seen in there.  And that was a big draw.  You'd never know who you're gonna see at McKee.  And so it was very successful him--successful for him.  I don't know of any other stories.
Speaker 2: Anything to do with Richard Pegue or Pervis Spann or--
Speaker 1: Okay.  This much I can tell you.  Pervis had a gimmick.  And the people took him serious.  Pervis would get on and say he--like as if he was taking phone calls.  And he would say, "Uh-uh! You know I don't talk to no--I don't talk to no men!" Bam! And a lady would call, "Oh yes honey.  Yes darling.  What do you want?"  And what they didn't know was those phone calls from men, that was fake.  No man was on the phone.  Because as many men as he would've offended, they would've been waiting on him at the parking lot.  But the people really bought that.  That Pervis don't talk to any men.  He only talks to the ladies.  Pegue--I give Pegue Richard--Richarde Pegue credit for being quite a merchandiser.  He did--that's how he came into the station [WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois].  He was in--doing merchandising.  And he was a music director for a while.  And in my opinion, the boy was never a great disc jockey.  But he was persistent.  And eventually he got a following.  And one of the things that Richard has in his favor is he has a phenomenal memory.  He's one of these persons who can say, that was Screaming Jay Hawkins.  That was made in 19 blah blah blah.  Recorded in Mussel Shoals--you know what I mean.  He worked at a record shop.  He worked for years at a record shop.  The amazing thing is he was able to maintain all that information.  He still does the same thing today.  Of course, I'm thinking he's probably got him some notes together today.  But off the top of his head he used to be able to tell you things about an artist.

Speaker 1: Well let me ask you.  Why did they call the--you guys 'The Good Guys'?
Speaker 2: Just named us that.  In other words, if we're the Good Guys that means everybody else is the bad guys.  All right.  So that's how it came to be.  WVON [radio station, Chicago, Illinois] Good Guys.
Speaker 1: Now each person had a nickname though.  Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So what were some of these nicknames?
Speaker 2: Okay. You had Herb Kent 'Cool Gent'.  You had Bill Crane, 'Butterball'.  Pervis Spann the 'Blues Man'.  McKee [Fitzhugh] didn't have a nickname.
Speaker 1: Rodney Jones?
Speaker 2: Rodney really didn't have a nickname.  It's like when people called him they used his first initial and his---E. Rodney Jones. You know, it wasn't just Rodney Jones--E. Rodney Jones.  So that was pretty much.  I can't tie a particular nickname into him.  Bill Lee was 'Doc'.  I don't know how he got that.  But it was like Bill 'Doc' Lee.  And Bill could do it all.  He could do gospel, religious programming.  That's what he finally wound up doing.  But he could set in on a regular show.  Kick it just like anybody else.  He was good.  Beautiful voice.

Speaker 1: Now back to your--you know, the black history--I mean the promotion.  Can you tell that story?
Speaker 2: On what now?
Speaker 1: How you got started in you creating stories and having dramatization?  Your black history promotion.
Speaker 2: My black history series?
Speaker 1: Right, the series.
Speaker 2: Okay.  These young people came to me.  I don't know how they were recommended or what.  And said, "Mr. Cordell, can you help us.  We've just about exhausted our money for this project.  And we're told that you can help us.  That you have like drama knowledge and so forth."  Because what this amounts to is these are dramatic vignettes.  You know.  I mean it's all acting with sound affects and everything.  For instance, you hear Harriett Tubman say, "Oh Miss Harriet, I can't go any further."  You hear the hounds baying in the background, "Woo!  Woo!"  You know.  And his is one of the people she's leading out to freedom and they get chicken, and wanna turn back.  And you hear her say in this deadly voice, "You'se gwine--You's gwine be free (whispering) or you's gwine be dead."  You know.  I mean and it's done dramatic--all of 'em are done like that.  You know.  With drama.  So it's--I mean it would be far more interesting for the kids or grown-ups as well to hear a dramatization of history.  It's called 'The Black History Series'.  What the name of it?  Black--I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Do you still have those on tape?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 5737
Speaker 1: Now you left--so the management had you out and then--is that when you got off of--you got-dDid you do radio after you left WVON [radio station, Chicago, Illinois]?  Or you got involved--that's when you got involved in the Urban League and Operation PUSH.
Speaker 2: I did radio--when I left 'VON, I didn't do radio any more until Mayor [Harold] Washington contacted me about doing a radio station that would broadcast exclusively to the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] projects.  I thought it was a fabulous idea.  And I told him I'd be very interested in doing it.  Now this is why I thought it was a fabulous idea.  You could deal with the issues that were facing the people in the projects at this time.  I felt like we could give like some positive things to--in other words praise the kids who were doing good, you know, which is encouragement for others to do good.  You gonna put 'em on the air.  You know.  I had a teen disc jockey idea.  I was going to be very informative in terms of legal tips, medical tips.  All kinds of things like that.  But I took the job naturally at a low rate of income not realizing that that would effect my social security.  I worked for maybe half or less than what I was making my last job at 'VON.  And the station never came--got off the ground.  Because the other powers that be found out about the station.  And they felt Mayor Washington was going to use it as his own personal vehicle, which was not the case.  But they blocked it.  So for a year I had nothing to do but just go to the office.  Just be there.  I took the time to put together programs on how and when to run the station and so forth.  But I couldn't.  We didn't have staff or anything.  So later, when I applied for Social Security, and I saw the amount I was getting, then I was--did some checking.  And I was told that it's based on so many of the last few, you know.  In other words, your last income.  That's what they base it on.  The guys who worked for me make more money than I make from the Social Security.  Wesley [South] gets twice what I get.  Now granted, some of the guys continued to work after I did.  But if I hadn't gone back to work, for this year, I would've had that kind of income.

Speaker 1: You played a role in the founding--you're one of the founding members of Operation PUSH?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about hat?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Reverend [Jesse] Jackson came to 'VON [WVON radio station, Chicago, Illinois].  We were all impressed with him.  We were impressed with what he had to say.  Because he wasn't talking totally about going to heaven.  He was talking about helping out now.  You know.  And he really was a country preacher when he came to us.  He didn't have a church.  But we were impressed.  So we got behind him.  And helped whatever movement he was working with.  Which was at the time--
Speaker 1: Operation Breadbasket?  No?
Speaker 2: It was before that even.  Okay.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Oh.
Speaker 2: Let's say Breadbasket.  Okay.  I think you're right.  And at the time, I don't know exactly what the percentage was.  But at the time, we had the local office here and the national office.  And the local office would get from fundraisers let's say 30 percent.  No.  That's--they got the big--we got the bigger portion here.  So let's say 70 percent would stay here, 30 percent to the national office.  But this is funds that are being raised by local off--local.  And Ralph Abernathy who took Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]'s spot decided that he wanted more for the national.  And it was almost a complete reverse.  "We'll take 70 and you keep 30."  And didn't fit well with Jesse nor any of the people working with Breadbasket here.  So I remember the day that Jesse called and asked if I could come and meet with a group of other people, leaders in the community.  And--for a meeting.  And we did.  I'm trying to think where it was held.  But it was at that meeting that the name was changed to Operation PUSH and that's how it was founded.  You know, it was a group of--I mean it was like all of your key businessmen and those who had like Johnson Publishing [Company] and Johnson Products [Company].  You know.  People who were really running businesses.  And huh--so that was it.  That's how it got started.

Speaker 1: Now when you look back on your career of radio, you know, and the importance of you know.  Where do you see black radio?  Like even what it was? You know WVON [radio station, Chicago, Illinois] today or even black radio period and where it was, you know, in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s]?  What are your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I--I've been a little disappointed in what they're doing in radio today.  So I don't really listen as intently as I did when I first left it.  Perhaps this story will give you the essence of what bothered me most.  When I was at 'VON, and we had health tips, legal tips, we had Operation Crimestop, black history.  We had all these good public service things interspersed in-between the music.  My philosophy was play what they wanna hear.  But inbetween, give 'em something they need.  You see.  And one time George Gillette came into my office and we were chatting.  And he said, "Lucky, let me ask you something."  I said, "Yeah, George."  "Don't you think we teach too much?"  I said, "I don't understand your question."  He said, "Well, you know, if you didn't have all these programs, we could play more music."  I said, "Well, you could certainly play more music, George.  But all I can say in defense of what I'm doing is our ratings."  I said, "Our ratings for a station our size--absolutely phenomenal."  He said, "Yeah, I know."  I'll tell you what made him think that.  I think that WJPC [radio station, Chicago, Illinois] had just opened and they were playing more music.  And he was of the opinion that black people wanna boogie.  They don't wanna hear about black history and health tips.  They dropped all of it.  Once I was gone, all the good public service was taken off and they just played music.  So they became a jukebox.  They're obligated by the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] to give a certain amount of public service.  But they did like, "Support education.  Stay in school blah blah--" you know.  Just nothings.  Then with the advent of hip-hop, I don't like the music.  I don't like the lyrics.  I don't like what they propagate.  So even on the other stations that--where they're playing music, like V103 [WVAZ radio station, Chicago, Illinois], I don't like the combination.  They got like a guy, a girl, two guys and a girl.  And they supposed to have this rapport back and forth.  It turns me off.  Have you ever listened?  I--it wasn't my shtick.  So really today radio is almost completely different than what it was back in the '60s and '70s.  It's another ball game.  And so I listen to a lot of news.
