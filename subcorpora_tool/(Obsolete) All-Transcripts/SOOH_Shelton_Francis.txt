 Simpson  Shelton  Today is May 26, 2011. My name is Lynne Simpson and I am on the  faculty of the Oklahoma State University Library. I am in Boley,  Oklahoma, with Dr. Francis Shelton as part of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program   s Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history  project. Our topic today is Boley, Oklahoma. Thank you for inviting me  to meet with you today.  Well, you   re welcome.  Would you tell me when and where you were born?  I was born in Boley, Oklahoma, in 1946, but I didn   t live here but six  months before moving to California.  Would you talk a little bit about your youth and your experiences with  Boley as a youth?  Well, we moved back   my parents did   in 1955, and I grew up in the  community called Rusk. That   s west of Boley about three miles. I spent  my elementary years at Boley, Oklahoma, at the Boley Elementary  School.  Would you describe your family and siblings and extended family here in  Boley?  Well, my mother and father were Bennie and Franchie Marzett. My  father   s a descendant of June and Clara Marzett. My mother is a  descendant of Lenny and William Sherman Wilcots  Jr . I had fun  growing up. I spent a lot of time visiting my grandparents. My  grandparents on my dad   s side lived about five hundred yards or more  away from the house where my  parents live . So we kind of grew up on  5  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  the farm. It was fun. (Laughs)  Would you tell us a little about your elementary school experience here  in Boley?  Oh, I had wonderful teachers  It was a great experience because when I  moved from California, I was in an integrated school system there and  when I moved to Boley, I thought it was really funny. Everybody looked  like me, and so I felt very comfortable, initially. My teachers were Ms.  Gibbs, Ms. Fondren, and Ms. Dukes. That was grade school and they  were excellent teachers. One of my teachers used to tell me or say to me  all the time,    You   re a funny looking thing     (Laughs) But it was a kind  of play on who I was and then she called the rest of us,    You little  ole   uglies     (Laughs) But she was a beautiful teacher.  What can you tell us about your high school experiences in Boley?  I had great high school experiences. I had one teacher I really liked, and  she had  attended  Langston  University  and came back. She taught me  all my science courses because I loved science. Mrs. Ashley was a  stickler on language and how you present yourself. We had to read about  thirteen books a year and  learn  over a hundred lines of poetry. We did  every year. Then I had Mr. Lawson. He was my math and music teacher.  Mr. Lawson was a  good  person because he was always genuinely  concerned about your future. Trying to think of all my teachers at this  age is kind of hard, to go back and think about who all were your  instructors in high school. I can   t remember them all, but I know that  your education was almost individualized in Boley. If you were having  problems, not only did the teacher know, your parents knew and  grandparents and everybody helped you. There was no way to fail in  Boley.  Who were your role models and what did you admire about them?  Mrs. Ashley, probably, was one of my biggest role models because she  was always    Miss Sophisticated.    She walked around with her head held  high. (Laughs) Then, Ms. Fondren was my grade school teacher, but I  always liked the way she carried herself, and I said,    When I grow up,  I   m going to act just like those ladies.    I loved hats, and a lot of the  ladies in Boley wore hats, and I always wanted to wear a hat. So I have  plenty of hats at the house. (Laughs)  How many generations back does your family trace here in Okfuskee  County, and how did they end up coming to Boley?  Probably on my dad   s side, they came from Louisiana to this area. They  6  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  initially lived in the community called IXL, which is now a town. Then  they moved to Sand Creek and from Sand Creek, they moved to Rusk.  That was  where  my grandparents  lived . On my mother   s side, I can  probably trace that way back. My mother   s family came from Carthage,  Texas, around Terrell, but I can trace them all the way back to my great-great-  grandfather who stepped off a boat, who was a fiddler. So we   re  able to track that family way back. I think my great-great-grandfather on  my mother   s side was from Indonesia.  How did your family make a living here in Boley?  Farmers. My dad worked in Oklahoma City and my mom traveled with  us from   well, let   s say from farm to farm. We chopped cotton,  chopped peanuts, picked squash, whatever my mother could find for us  to do we did. We worked all summer. In the wintertime, we   d pick  cotton and my dad raised pigs, so that was a source of income, and he  had cattle. So he was able to take care of his family. I used to think my  dad would get tired, but he didn   t. He worked two or three jobs. But  there was eight of us.  Eight children or six children?  Eight children and then my mom and dad. So there were ten of us     usually, not only us. My dad   s brother died, and he had six children. My  dad had raised those  children . We all lived on the farm, and then I had  a cousin who was older than me who lived with us until we moved to  Oklahoma and she went to live with my grandmother, who lived across  the field. So there was a bunch of us  My dad had the responsibility of  everybody that was on that farm along with my grandfather. So they  took care of everybody.  Did you raise your family in Boley?  No, I raised my children in Oklahoma City. I moved back to Boley in  1985 after retiring from V.A. Medical Center.  Why did you want to return to Boley after you retired?  I   ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur. I liked the way that people  had their own businesses in town. When I was a child, all of Main Street  had businesses along the sides, either on the left or the right. There was a  millinery, there were night clubs, there was a teen club, a couple of  grocery stores, the bank, the service station, the cotton gins. Believe it or  not, I used to ride with my grandfather on the wagon to bring the cotton  to the cotton gin in Boley. I probably was about five years old and that  was in between visits from California, here. And I remember that, sitting  7  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Simpson  Finchum  Simpson  Shelton  Finchum  on the wagon watching my grandfather deal for his cotton. (Laughs)  How did you choose your profession?  Oh, I think the one teacher, Eva Mae Young, who   s my husband   s  cousin, was my teacher and she kind of gave me an interest in science  along with Dr.  Earnest  Holloway. He taught some classes, and he was  one of my inspirations, also. I think that   s where I first had the inkling  that I might want to be a nurse or a research tech or something so I could  make a decent living. That   s where I got it. Then when I went to  Langston, I enrolled in basic courses. I started into the nursing courses,  but while I was there, somebody tried to convince me to go into physical  therapy and I decided at that time, if I could be a physical therapist, I  could be a biochemist, because that   s what my love was. So I majored in  biology with a minor in chemistry and a minor in sociology, and I was  able to use all three of those because I started work at V.A. Medical  Center in the research department. By the time I  left to move to Boley ,  I was chief of three labs.  What degrees do you have beyond your undergraduate degree from  Langston University?  I have a master   s degree in adult and occupational education and then I  have my current degree, which is in adult and occupational education.  What degree is that?  My doctorate.  From?  From OSU in Stillwater. I   m very proud of that. That was work.  And was the master   s from     The master   s was from OSU also, yes.  Thank you.  Can I go back and ask a question before you move on?  Yes.  Oh, yes.  When you were growing up, with that many in the family, did you have  8  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Simpson  certain chores on the farm that you were responsible for?  Oh, we all had chores. In the morning, we would get up and milk about  eight to ten cows before we caught the bus. We would milk those cows.  It was still dark and we would be in the barnyard with a lantern or  something where we could see to milk. Then we would go back home,  get showered   well, let   s say get a bath and then cook breakfast and be  ready to catch the bus. And the house had to be clean before we left. My  mother worked for the school. She was the dietician, and so she didn   t  want to walk back  into the house  in the evening when she was ready to  prepare dinner and the house would be  in disarray  or the kitchen would   have dirty dishes . Everything was in place when she  arrived  in the  evening so she could cook for us. (Laughs)  Was education important? Did the rest of the kids in the family go on  to   ?  Yes, my mother always talked about education and her not having it  because my parents didn   t finish their high school diplomas until we  went to college. They said,    Well, if we   re sending the kids to college,  we might as well get our high school degree.    My sister used to laugh.  She said,    Momma educated all of us,  but  her and dad were the ones  who had the degrees.    (Laughs) Okay, but yes.  What were some of the jobs he did in Oklahoma City?  My dad worked for Fletcher   s Manufacturing. At one time, he  made   chairs, because we all had our own personal chair with our name on it  and  Fletcher   s designed  chairs. Then he worked just odd jobs,  whatever he could find. I   m trying to think of the other company he  worked for, but it   s been awhile, so I can   t remember all the places. He   worked for  Haskell Lemons. They still are in business. They  haul  cement  for lots of highways. I think, during one summer, my brothers  worked with my dad. I think there are a couple of colleges that they did  the asphalt  or concrete  and laid the driveways and the parking lots.  Yes, my dad had all kinds of jobs. He eventually had his own dump  truck and he had a couple of people that worked with him.  Is that original family home place still   ?  It   s still there, yes. I   ll go out today before I leave  to go to work . My  sister lives in my parents    home. It   s a nice home. They built it in  probably the sixties. I think it cost them around  20,000. That house is  probably valued about  275,000 right now.  Could you describe the home?  9  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  It   s a big house. It   s brick. I think the living room will entertain a  hundred. When you walk in, there   s a big living room to the left. If you  walk forward, there   s a den. The kitchen is to the right of that and then  on the left is a bathroom. You come back out   or either you could travel  into another big bedroom that leads into a hallway and there   s a full  bathroom there and there are two bedrooms on the   what corner is that?  It would be on the east side of the house and you   d come back and you   d  be right back where you started. But it   s a big house. And there   s a  bedroom off from the living room because my husband and I were the  only ones married at the time, so they  added  a bedroom for us.  Of all the children that grew up around you in your home, how many of  those are in Boley today?  I have a brother who went to Langston. His name is Larry. My sister  Stella, she was a teacher at Boley, also worked in Oklahoma City. I have  a sister Clara, who started out at Langston, ended up at   I think they call  it the University of Central Oklahoma now. She lacks about three hours,  or nine hours. She lives here, and me. Yes, I have brothers and sisters in  California, but they   ll be here for the holiday.  What was your neighborhood like?  Our neighborhood was like a big farm with kids everywhere. My auntie  lived to the left of my grandmother and she had the six kids. My  grandparents lived in the middle. We lived to the right of the house. Kids  were always up and down the roads. We would go to church, and  children who were in the community would walk back home with us.  We called it a piece away. We   d walk halfway back to their house and  they walked halfway. Pretty soon, we were in the middle and we went  home. But yes, it was a lot of fun having all my cousins because down  the road from there was my uncle and he had about five kids. So I grew  up in a community within a community because we called that area  Marzett Corners. Okay, and then we would come to town on Saturday  night. My mother would sit in the car patiently. She would give us about  an hour to go in the little club and kind of walk down the street, and then  she   d pack us up and go home. That was our outing during the week.  Can you tell us about some of the other organizations that were active in  Boley, like homemaker clubs or culture clubs?  Well, there was the Ladies Industrial Club, the Self Culture Club, there  were two women organizations. Then you had the sororities like Delta  Sigma Theta, Alpha Kappa Alpha   yes, I think that   s what they called  themselves. (Laughs) Then you had the Future Farmers of America, you  10  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  had 4-H Club, the little BYU, most churches had that. There were just a  number of organizations that were active when I was growing up and  still are today. There are a few that we don   t have, but we   ve gained  some like Secret Pals. Secret Pals is a group of women, and they don   t  know who their pal is until the end of the year, and each year they select  a pal. It   s a good organization.  Were there very active cooperative extension agents in Boley?  Yes. Ms. Fuller and Mr. Coleman were from the 4-H Club or the  Extension office that was housed in Okemah, but they worked in the  Boley area and they lived here.  How would you describe Boley today compared to how it was when you  were growing up?  There   s a little less going on, but Boley, I think, is coming alive. We  have worked with a group   I call it the Well Spring staff, but there are  other organizations in the community who are very concerned about  where we go from here. Each group is doing something to try to keep the  community alive. We   re working as a whole now, and that makes it  better when everybody comes together and they have some goals. The  Save Boley committee meets once a month, and we have goals that we  have to reach during the month and report on those. I like reporting that  I   ve done something, that something exists. You can see it and feel it.  What is the Well Springs staff?  Well Springs is a mental health, education, and healthy lifestyles group.  We do an afterschool program and after school, the children come to the  center. We have about forty-five. It will probably grow this summer  because I know we have five or six applications right now for the  summer program. The summer program starts at ten and runs to two.  The afterschool program starts at about three and it might run to about  nine or ten o   clock based on what we need to do with the groups and  what we have to do with the individuals, because we do home visits.  What age groups do you serve, primarily?  Two to ninety-nine. We have some adults that we work with, too. We   re  going to be teaching a computer class. When we did the Reader   s Digest  contest, we had volunteers that came to the center and helped with the  voting of those people who didn   t know how to use the computer, those  who gave permission for us to vote for them. We came in fourth place  and we   ll receive ten thousand dollars. So we   re proud of that.  11  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  That is a great thing to be proud of. Who were some of the town   s  leaders?  Who were? Oh, gosh  There was Mr. Ashley, Mrs. Ashley, and the  Dolphins. You had the Lees, Wilcotses because my uncle served as  mayor for over twenty-three years in this town. His name was Sam  Wilcots.  How were the leaders chosen?  Well, most of those people served on the  Town Trustees . At one time,  Dr. Sanders was on the  Town Trustees . If they didn   t serve on the   Town Trustees , they served on the Chamber and they were elected to  office on either one of those.  How did they kind of guide the town in the direction they wanted it to  go?  I guess through grants, through organizations, just a combination of  things. I do believe we had some of those natural researchers who kind  of kept up on what was going on in the state, in the county, and so that  information was always brought back, either to the Chamber of  Commerce or the  Town Trustees .  What was the focal point of the town? Was it social organizations? Was  it the school? Was it business?  The focal point was the school and from the school, I think you would  select the businesses next because the businesses supported the school. If  you lose your school, you lose your town. That was one of the reasons  we  founded  Well Springs, because children who were used to being  around each other every day were now dispersed to at least three  different schools. So  the children  went through a period of adjustment  and learning how to get along with other children within that school  system. Well Springs was there to kind of make that transition smoother.  If the child had problems, whoever was assigned to that particular  student would go to the school, visit with the teachers, visit with the  parents and try to make sure that we didn   t have a large number of  suspensions because we did start with that suspension thing and then it  tapered off. I don   t know if the student   the kids who were new to the  school system  or  their way of acting which was normal in their school,  was not accepted in another school.  Has there been any consideration for reestablishing a school here in  Boley?  12  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  There has been. We have about three people who are looking at a charter  school. They   ve already gone through their certification process, so there  is a possibility that we might establish a charter school at the school  that   s here, that has kind of been left. Oh, and we do the upkeep on the  school. Even though there   s nobody there, the yard gets kept, and I think  Rashon Jones is over at the gym so the kids can go over on Sunday  evening and play at the gym. They pay a small little fee, and they   re  allowed to use it.  About how many children are we talking about for the     For the gym?  Well, no, just for the community itself, just roughly.  Probably, it   s over a hundred, over a hundred.  And so, they go to which schools?  See, what we had was thirty-nine, if you   re talking about school-age  children. But we have plenty of children under that age because we   ve  just had a baby boom. Probably, about forty or forty-five that are at other  schools. As a matter of fact, the same kids that are in other schools are  also in our program. So we just have a few that are not.  When did this one close?  Let   s see, it   s been closed a year.  Not that long.  Yes, so it   s still fresh. We   re going into our second year.  Could you walk us through the town physically as it was and describe  some of the buildings and things like that, like the Masonic Temple or  the banks?  Okay, let me start here and we   ll move down. I don   t know which side  of the street you want me to start down. Let   s see, that would be the west  side of the street, if you start at this corner, there would have been a  restaurant and next to that was an empty store. Then you move up. That  store was like a restaurant. My auntie ran that and then there was one  that Ms. Woods lived in. Her name was Ruby Woods and it was like a  house on Main Street. Then you would   ve gone to Arthur Hearns, it was  a nightclub. Then you would have gone to   there was another building  and I can   t think of what it was. Ben Keys had a dry goods store, and he  13  had a little restaurant-type thing for teenagers where you could get  hamburgers and Cokes and those kinds of refreshments. Next door to  that would have been the old hotel. Then there was a store. I can   t think  of that one either. You move on down. There would have been Miss  Bands Millinery   beautiful hats. I can remember when I moved back to  Boley, it was still in business in 1985, and I was surprised it was still  there. I bought a couple of hats out of there. As a matter of fact, more  than a couple. I   m not going to tell that to my husband though. And then  down next to that   well, he   ll know now won   t he? (Laughs)  Next to that was the hardware store. The hardware store was a  combination of two buildings. It was owned by Mr. Meyers when I was  a child, and I always kind of wanted that store. When I got grown, I  bought it. My husband   s auntie had a dry goods store where you could  go buy clothes and those kinds of things and then you would   ve gotten  to the hardware store because there was a big arch that led from one  building to the other. That building was called The Leader, and I own  The Leader now. So I have The Leader and the hardware store. If you go  next door, it would have been the bank. From there was a nightclub.  Then the next one was like a restaurant. The Williams    used to own that.  Down from there was another building. I   m trying to think of what was  in it. Well, I can   t remember. The  T. M.  Haynes building would have  been the next building, which is on the corner of First and Pecan. I think  that   s the street. And the Haynes building still stands. Now, next to that  was the senior   well, it was the Town Hall and the jail.  I will cross the street and start back north. There was Bernice   s.  Bernice   s was a nightclub, but it was a two-story building and as a  child   well, no teenagers were allowed in there. If they saw you even  walking toward the place, they   d go,    Where are you going?    (Laughs)  And then there was what was called the fairgrounds where now, there   s  a mortuary there and there was nothing. It was a big lot and the fair  would come to town, and that   s where you would get your circus and all  those kind of things in that area. Then you would come to the service  station and that was Adley   s Service Station. It was owned by   well, it  was Young   s, but their daughter Ethlene Gonzales now runs that. Next  was the post office and there was a Smokaroma there, that I can  remember. Now that   s Well Springs, our second building. Then next  door was the Brooks building. From the Brooks building would have  been the Laundromat. From there, there was a theater that people talked  about. At one time, it was still there. Then it was Sarge Moore   s grocery  store and you go on up, you cross the street, and that was about Third  Street. It was the bank   s building. They had a grocery store. Right next  to that was a nightclub that   s now Well Springs. Then next to that was  McCormick   s building. They started remodeling and didn   t finish it.  Next door was the   I   m trying to think of what that was. I can   t  14  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  remember now.  The next one was a taxi cab stand and the taxi was run by   I   m trying to  think of his name. I know he was killed there. Next door was the  Releford   s building. After Releford   s was the Brooks building. That   s  where the rural water used to store all of its   well currently, they stored  it and now have moved to another place. Then there was a little  nightclub right on this corner where the American Legion is right now,  the Masons, and I think that one belonged to Walker, but I   m not for  sure. That   s where the kids would spend time. There   s another building  if we go back another block, that   s where the teen club was, in between  the theater and another building. So that   s where we would go. I can   t  even think of what the name was now. Last Chance, I think it was called.  I   m not for sure.  Tell us about the theater.  Well, there used to be a theater and the remnants of it were there when I  was a girl. You could see the top of it was high, all that has caved in now  and gone. It   s right next to Mixon   s building because Hughlin Mixon  owns the building currently, and his daughter is remodeling it. It   s the  sort of bluish building with the blue door. Now it   s going to be a  restaurant/club-type thing.  Could you tell us a little about the county fairs?  Well, I remember just one and I   m trying to think of how old I was when  I went. Probably about seven or eight and I just remember Ferris wheels  and things there. But other than that, I can   t tell you anything.  What other kinds of events or sporting events come to mind when you  think about Boley?  Basketball. That was the extracurricular activity for every kid that was  here. I knew that if I didn   t play basketball, I wasn   t getting in town.  (Laughs) So all the kids either played in the band, so you learned to play  an instrument and all my sisters and brothers played an instrument, or  either played the drums. There were times that we had our own little  band at the house because all the instruments were there for the band.  Sometimes we made noise and then other times, we would play on key a  specific song. But basketball, softball, and baseball because the school  had an excellent baseball team. So we would come over and go to the  baseball games in the summer and when the baseball team was playing  during school term. Let   s see, what else? Rodeos, I can remember those.  I   m not sure what else. When you don   t think about those things, they  kind of fade and then you   ll think again and remember what it was.  15  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  (Laughs)  Could you tell us some more about the community traditions that are  still being celebrated, like the rodeo?  Oh, we do Juneteenth, and that   s celebrating the independence of  African Americans from slavery. We do that around the nineteenth of  the month. It   s usually on a weekend and they have a big fish fry and  everybody comes to that. There are other things that we celebrate. I  know the Deltas used to do what   s called Bit-by-Bit type things and they  would come and do a program. And they still do programs within the  community, Delta Sigma Theta sorority. I can   t think of anything else  right now. Maybe you   ll have to ask that question again, let me rethink  it. (Laughs)  Could you tell us some of your rodeo traditions?  I don   t know about traditions. All I know is that you go to the rodeo.  That was the only thing that   s there at nighttime, during the time we  have the rodeo. There   s the big parade, I remember that. After the  parade, you go to the rodeo and the bull riding and bareback riding. I can  remember that because I couldn   t   I   m like,    Why would anybody with  good sense get on a horse and ride it that way?    Strap him down and  jump around. That   s craziness to me, but it was fun to watch. I   m like,     Please don   t die     (Laughs) The bull riding and the roping and the team  roping and the barrel racing, all of that was fun just to watch, it was  entertaining.  What were the interactions like with neighboring towns here in Okfuskee  County?  I can only tell you that from my point of view. When I was a child, I  remember going to Okemah and shopping. I know that there were places  that we had to go to the back. One of the restaurants that they wanted to  get hamburgers from was there, and they would have to go to the back  door to get the hamburgers. I never wanted a hamburger because of that.  The other thing was there was one grocery store that all the African  Americans seemed to go to. I don   t think they really shopped anywhere  else but that grocery store. I don   t remember wandering far from it. That  was Okemah and seldom did we go to Prague.  As a child, we stayed at home. If you got a chance to go somewhere, that  was like a treat, especially when you have seven sisters and brothers. We  kind of took turns going places and my grandmother would take me all  the time because I knew how to act. (Laughs) I knew if you had a certain  personality, people would want to be around you or take you. When I  16  Finchum  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  moved here, I was the mascot for the band. I was the only kid that  traveled with the band, but I knew how to act. I knew how to mind, and  if somebody told me to do something, I didn   t fuss about it. I just did it.  What order where you in the children?  I   m the oldest. There   s one sister older than me that   s my cousin that my  dad raised. That   s the one that went to stay with my grandmother when  we moved from California here. But I was the oldest, and so there were  a lot of demands put on me because my mother said that,    If you  succeed, the rest will succeed because they   re watching you.    So I had  to be the prim, the proper, the do-it-or-die personality. (Laughs) And  everybody followed. I have excellent sisters and brothers. We all get  along. People go,    How do you get along with your sister like that?    I  just do.  I   m assuming with that many children, there were hand-me-down  clothes?  Oh, I love hand-me-downs  I didn   t mind. See, I was the oldest, but I got  hand-me-down clothes from my cousin who lived in Oklahoma City. We  called her the rich kid. (Laughs) So all of her dresses and things came to  me because I was just one size less than she was, and then they just went  straight on down.  Did your mother sew?  My mother sewed. She was an excellent seamstress. My mother worked  for Singer sewing machine company in California and she made all the  display items for that company, for Hanford, California. So we all  learned to sew because she taught sewing. When she   d come home with  this sewing machine, she would teach us how to count stitches and we  learned to sew, all of us. My sister makes drapes professionally. Another  sister makes pillows and those are kind of sideline things where they  make income. But, my sister Clara makes the most beautiful drapes, yes.  Could you tell us about the boys    home that was here?  Okay. The boys    home was what   s now our correctional facility. Those  boys went to school with us. I never thought they were bad boys or had  done anything serious because they were in school with us, and they just  acted like the rest of the boys at school. I know that there were times  when if something happened to our gym, that we would use the gym at  the correctional facility for basketball games. They would come to Boley  and we would go there. But it was a lot of boys up there. I never had any  issues with them. They were always kind.  17  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  What was the importance of the church, growing up?  For me, very important because I   ve always had this belief in God and  He   s who sustains me. So as a child, I always knew about Jesus, and the  churches played a role in our beliefs because of the programs that they  would have. BYU was one of them where in the evening times we  would go back to church and have a youth program. But the churches  interacted with one another. I don   t care if one was Church of God and  Christ or Church of God or Baptist, Methodist, whatever. I think because  of our race, we just kind of mingled, and the churches usually housed the  leaders and the leaders were the preachers.  Did the ministers come from Boley?  Some came from Boley. Others came from Tulsa, Oklahoma City,  Shawnee, Bristow, wherever.  Did you have any special family traditions?  I don   t know what you would call special. We had reunions. The  Wilcotses had a reunion and the Marzetts had a reunion, both sides of  my parents. The Marzetts    reunion was usually the last week of July and  the first of August. Sometimes we would travel to Ohio or Birmingham  for reunions, so that was a traditional thing for us. And then every year,  because we had church on our property, it was right next to my  grandmother   s house, we had revivals, family revivals on the place. We  would invite people to our home for the revival. People came from  Oklahoma City and Tulsa, wherever, to the revivals on the Marzett  property.  Could you tell me some of the craft traditions in your family?  Oh, quilts. I was so tired of quilts  (Laughs) We would start quilting  right after school ended and we would quilt into September. We finished  out whatever we didn   t finish during the summer, and so I learned to  develop patterns. We would cut up old clothing. Even there were some  new materials purchased. They would use material from flour sacks.  They used to have the real pretty flour sacks. My mother made us  dresses out of those flour sacks, so during the summer, all the girls  would be in my grandmother   s house. We would be in one room and it  was fun because on Wednesday, we would have what was called prayer  hour and we would pray and then we would do our quilts. I make quilts.  I can still make a quilt when I put my heart to it. (Laughs) I have a  sewing machine in my house and it   s still in the box. I bought it about  ten years ago. (Laughs) I don   t ever have time to sew. I say when I  18  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  retire   I don   t know when that   s going to be   I   m going to sew. But,  yes, we made quilts.  Do you have any special family heirlooms or keepsakes from that time?  Yes, I still have some of the quilts I made, and I make sure that they get  dry cleaned. I keep them up because that, to me, is a treasure because it  keeps my grandmother with me because she taught me a trade. There are  people who make a living just sewing quilts. I said that I would never  starve to death because I could sew. Let   s see, I probably have a skirt  that my mother made me when I was in college. She made pleated skirts  and they were unusual because she would sew the pleat and she accented  the hip area. (Laughs) So when she made a skirt for you, it was really  made for you. When I went to Langston, I had these little pleated skirts  and people thought they were so cute. They looked cute on me, but  they   d look different on them because of the accent. My mother would  come to the hip line, sew that skirt down with seams, and then the pleats  would fold over and when you walked, they   d kick out. They were  absolutely cute  I said I was going to keep that and make a few for my  granddaughter, but I never did. (Laughs) But yes, I have one of those old  skirts.  Did you have any special food traditions?  My grandmother liked collard greens and ham hocks, so that   s the one.  But they teach you to eat healthy and I teach healthy lifestyle choices on  foods, so I can   t eat a lot of things that I learned to eat when I was a  child.  What was your typical family meal?  On a Sunday?  On a Sunday.  On a Sunday, it was the same thing every Sunday. Roast beef with  potatoes, carrots, and peppers, cornbread, greens, candied yams, and on  a good day, squash or something from the garden.  Well, thank you so much for your time and I think we   re going to come  back. We   re not finished.  Okay.  ------- End of May 26, 2011 interview -------  19  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  We are resuming our interview with Dr. Francis Shelton. Thank you so  much for meeting with us. It is April 6, 2012, and we are back in Boley,  Oklahoma. Would you talk about the role of the church and the various  churches in town?  The churches are quite active. I know they have a number of events  during the year. Most of the time, if they   re having something, they   ll  send you an invitation. But as far as some of the politics, some of the  things that go on in the community, the church is usually the lead.  What were your neighbors like growing up?  Industrious. Most of my neighbors either sharecropped or they worked  for other people during the summer. I know that as a kid, we would pick  squash for  1.25 a basket during the summer, chop cotton, chop peanuts.  Sometimes we did it for neighbors, sometimes we went outside the  community to work. Yes, they were just like we were.  What kinds of local gatherings and events were there?  Let   s see. We had activities at the church, usually appreciation services.  In Boley, we had the rodeo, Juneteenth, fish fries. In our community, my  mother would let us have weenie roasts on Saturday evenings, so we did  that maybe two or three times during the summer and the other kids  would come to the house for that. Other parents in the community did  the same thing. Those were our gatherings if you were a child, but  mostly church.  Are there any community traditions that are still celebrated today that  have remnants from before?  Probably the Juneteenth celebration and the rodeo. I am trying to think  of things that are left over or that continue. I think that   s all that I can  recall.  Why are those still important to your community?  Because it allows them to come together. It   s sort of that    United we  stand       I   ve forgotten what that statement is called.     United we stand, divided we fall.        divided we fall.    So, the unity is there, and I think when we have  events in the community, it just kind of unifies us. We just had one, the  Praise Day at the park on the thirty-first. A number of churches came  together, and then we had a young man who is trying to start his career  20  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  that was there. So, it   s something that we want to do every year. The  purpose was to pull everybody together so we could get a better  connection with one another.  Can you describe interactions with neighboring towns, like Paden and  Okemah?  Okemah we didn   t go to very much, because there was really just one  store that I remember that we could shop at in Okemah. If you wanted a  burger or something, you had to go down this alley to get a burger in the  back. Prague, every once in a while we would go to Prague. My parents  usually shopped outside the communities, those two. So, shopping was  in Seminole or Shawnee or Ada.  Why was that? Did you know why?  Prejudice.  Could you talk about the role of the boys    home and the correctional  facility?  What I recall of the boys    home is the children attended school with us.  The boys    home became the correctional center. It came before I came  back to Boley. I think I left in the sixties. So, what I know about the  correctional center, I found out after I moved back to Boley. Most of the  time, the warden either belonged to the chamber of commerce or was  involved in the community some type of way. The correctional facility,  as well as when it was the boys    home, offered employment. Probably  over 95 percent of the people in this community had jobs there. It   s  probably about 5 percent, now. The present deputy warden or assistant  warden is quite active in the community. Haven   t seen very much of the  warden.  What was your religion growing up?  Baptist.  Did your parents come from different religious backgrounds or did they  share them?  My dad was Methodist. My mother was Baptist because that was the  closest church to us. (Laughs) And it was within walking distance,  because my dad used a car to take his mother to the community of IXL  to Pleasant Hill AME. We went to Pleasant Hill Baptist. So, yes. I  forgot, as a teenager, I was Pentecostal Holiness because we had a  minister that came here.  21  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Finchum  Shelton  What traditions or customs have you made an effort to preserve?  That   s a good question. (Laughs) I don   t know any, other than family  reunions. Customs, making sure I sit at the dinner table with my family.  That I miss, because when I was growing up, we always   my  grandmother had this big L table and we   d all sit at that table and talk in  the evenings when we ate dinner, or during the times they came from the  field, and we would eat dinner at the table.  Did you have any special food traditions?  Collard greens. My grandmother made the best collard greens. Let   s see.  They ate chitlins, I didn   t like chitlins. My grandmother would bake pies  and cakes for special holidays. I think my favorite thing was hot water  bread. She would fix hot water bread and leave it on the stove. And if we  were hungry, you could always go get a piece of bread.  Hot water?  Hot water bread.  Could you describe it?  It   s like fried bread, but fried bread is a flat Native American-type bread.  But fry bread is cornbread that   s hot dropped in oil. It   s crunchy on the  outside and soft inside. So, it was always there. Kids would snack.  Do you still make   ?  I still make hot water bread. That   s one of my husband   s favorite things  to have with greens. So, if I cook cabbage or greens, we always have hot  water bread. My daughter likes it, but she hasn   t learned to make it, yet.  But if I say I   m fixing hot water bread, she says,    Okay, I   ll be over.     (Laughter)  Does she live in Boley?  She lives in Boley.  She does live in Boley.  Do you fry it in just oil, or   ?  No, it   s fried in oil, but it   s usually canola oil or vegetable oil. Not just  any kind of oil. What you do is take meal and you pour hot water   what  22  Finchum  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  you add, baking powder and a little salt, and you pour it in and it makes  a real thick paste and then you drop fry that. It   s delicious. You can add  a pinch of sugar, whatever your taste is.  I   m thinking in bacon grease, it would be really good. (Laughter)  It would be. It would have a different flavor, but it would be good. No,  we   re trying not to eat anything heavy so that   s why the oil changes.  Oh, that   s why you do it in canola. You were raised doing it in lard?  Yes.  What stories have come down to you about your parents or  grandparents? And were there any themes or lessons that they were  designed to teach?  Sorry, I have to think about this. Stories    Some of our stories were  about relatives that lived in other parts of the country. One of the stories  that was passed down is that on my grandfather   s side, there were twins  and one got in trouble and they had to leave overnight. So, they ended  up in Oklahoma. Part of the family is in IXL and the other part, because  they couldn   t find property, moved to Rusk. So, there is two different  Marzetts. One in IXL, spells theirs with an E, and the others in Rusk  spell theirs   they dropped the E when they moved here.  But they   re all the same family?  They   re all the same family.  Oh, okay. What are some of your childhood memories?  Visiting my grandmother, especially during the summer, because we  would quilt. I think I told you about that before. Every Wednesday, we  had prayer service. All my cousins, it was around thirty-two of us, and  we would be at my grandmother   s at one time. During the time, we were  either canning during the summer or working in the fields during the  winter. I remember picking cotton and it was cold. Fingertips bloody  from hitting that boll. (Laughs) That   s a strange thing to remember, but I  do remember that.  Did you use pressure cookers when you were doing the canning?  Yes, that   s how I got   this arm has little spots on it because I was  visiting my grandmother. We were all at my grandmother   s and it was  one of the canning seasons. My mother, she had put on black-eyed peas  23  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  and she asked me to go home and check the temperature. I did not  understand what she meant. So, when I got to the house, I went in the  kitchen and started loosening the pressure cooker handles, those little  things. The pot lid blew off, the beans exploded, and it kind of burned  me. From then on, I knew how to use a pressure cooker. (Laughs)  Do you own a pressure cooker, yourself?  I own one.  You do? Okay.  I know how to use it. (Laughs) But I would never send a child in to  check it if they didn   t understand it. My mother thought I knew because  I watched her all the time. But it never dawned on me that it was under  pressure. The lid stuck in the ceiling when it came off. My mother and  grandmother   well, the family could hear what happened in the house  because the back door was open and we had the screened-in porch.  When that lid went, they came running. Could have taken my head off.  Yes.  But I was down like this, too. (Gestures) (Laughter)  Fortunately, you were short.  Still short  (Laughs)  And young. Who were your childhood heroes?  Let   s see, I had several. Mrs. Velma Dolphin Ashley because she was  one of the teachers at the school. My dad was my hero because he took  care of all of us. He worked two or three jobs. My grandfather because  he was the head of the family and everybody followed his direction. My  grandfather would sit on the porch and whistle and everybody would  come running. That meant he wanted something. Yes, he was my hero  because he had control  (Laughter)  What kind of entertainment did you engage in? Was it family based or  community based?  We had a singing group, gospel, so my mother would travel with us to  different churches in the area. We also had a revival at my  grandmother   s every year and people would come to visit. We would  sing and other people would come and sing, and so I enjoyed that. I   m  trying to think of   we got a chance to come to town. There was a little  24  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Finchum  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  night club on Main Street, and my mother would   it wasn   t a night club.  It was like a teen center, and they played music. We would come and  dance on Saturday. My mother would sit in the car, in front of the  building. If the door was open, she would try to see us, make sure we  were okay. We could spend maybe an hour and then we would get back  in the car and go home. We were always supervised.  Were there any particular craft traditions that you remember?  The quilt making. Let   s see. Was there anything else? My grandfather,  when things would break, my dad, too, would repair those like hoes,  rakes, shovels, those kind of things. They always had vise grips and  things to work on pipe on the farm. The crafts were usually done at  school, either in home economics or in the shop where Mr. Lee, who  was also the banker at one time, would teach crafts. That   s it.  What were your favorite songs and music growing up?  Sam Cooke was my favorite, favorite artist as far as music, and I still  stay with Sam, today. I   m not sure what else. But music was what I  spent most of my time thinking about. I guess if you sing, you   re  involved with music, and because I liked   oh, and Mahalia Jackson. She  was absolutely wonderful. Aretha Franklin. I   m trying to think of who  else. Oh, and I liked jazz. Nancy Wilson.  Did you listen to that music   ?  I listened to that music.  On the radio or in venues   ?  On the radio, and then we had a record player so we had forty-fives and  what   s that other one?  Thirty-three.  Yes. (Laughter) So, we listened to those. Sometimes the neighbors  would call because we would put the record player in the window and  play the records and dance outside the house on the north side of the  house. So, on a still day you could hear it in the community. My mother  would get calls for us to turn the music down.  Oh, my. (Laughter) Are there any family heirlooms or keepsakes that  you still own?  I think I talked about the quilts the last time. I have a few quilts. I just  25  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  received two new quilts from my sister-in-law. They are absolutely  gorgeous. I think that would be what I would have.  Could you talk a little about some special family traditions?  Let   s see. We would have Christmas. During Christmas, what we would  do, the oldest grandchild would be able to give out the gifts. It just  rotated every year down to the next child that was the oldest, and I liked  that. My daughter had a chance to pass out gifts, and she was so excited.  We hid her gifts. (Laughter) I   ll never do that again because she gave  out all the gifts and didn   t have one, and she started crying. So, no, we  don   t    (Laughter) We thought it would be funny, but it wasn   t funny.  Would you describe a typical family dinner, and who did the cooking?  My mother did the cooking. Every Sunday, it was mostly pot roast with  potatoes and carrots, and then we would have cornbread. Let   s see.  Mashed potatoes, sometimes. Pork chops and gravy and green beans.  Usually, candied yams. Cabbage. Whatever was fresh in the garden is  what she cooked on Sundays so Sunday was my favorite day of the week  to eat, because not only did we eat, most people knew my mother  cooked so they would drop by. If she had something, everyone that came  by ate. So, yes, Sunday. My grandmother basically did something  similar to that. Actually, we could eat at any house we wanted to on  Sundays, because every household   my parents, then my grandmother,  my Aunt Lillian, my Aunt Clara Belle, and my Uncle Buck all lived  within a quarter of a mile. So, we would just walk sometimes and eat.  Have a traveling feast. (Laughter)  We   d have a traveling feast  (Laughter)  Did you have any special desserts?  Yes, peach cobbler. Apple cobbler. My grandmother made a pie and   it  was two fruits, apple and pear. It was good, yes. It was the best. It had  this cinnamon and butter taste. My mother made what   s called a butter  roll. It was just like basically bread with sort of a real sweet buttery  taste. Matter of fact, she made it at the school, and so it was one of my  favorites.  What did your family enjoy doing together?  Everything. We played softball, football, we worked the garden together.  We milked cows and did most of the farm work together, even with my  cousins because we would milk the cows and bring the stock up at my  26  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  grandfather   s house. So, we were up early in the morning, probably  around five, five-thirty milking the cows. Then in the summertime, we  had little chores. Like if there were weeds around, we all used a sling  blade and kept the weeds down around the houses and little outhouses  and all of those things. So, that was a chore for us. You didn   t find  weeds at my grandmother   s. You didn   t find them at our house, either,  because they   and if you were bored, they found something for you to  do so we were seldom bored.  What world events had the most impact on you growing up?  Probably the death of Martin Luther King. I liked Malcolm X and  Medgar Evers. When those people died, I kind of felt a loss because they  represented leadership to me. The next person was President Kennedy. I  think his death and Martin Luther King   s impacted me more than any  other deaths, even family deaths. Because I saw freedom sliding away,  because I was part of the sit-ins and the boycotts and everything else that  was going on in the sixties.  How was your community affected? Were there any memorials here in  Boley?  I was a teenager so I really don   t remember. I just remember the town  being quiet when Martin Luther was assassinated. I don   t think I  remember a hush over the town like that in all of my days. People really  weren   t talking   the ones I was around. I imagine people were having  conversations, but they were conversations that were sad.  What do you see as the impact of integration on the town of Boley?  Not much. We were free. (Laughs) In this community. It was outside of  this community. In this community, you could do anything your heart  desired. You could go to any store. You didn   t have to take the back  door to anything. So, as far as the community, I don   t think there was  much of an impact, commercially. Maybe outside the community there  probably was. I   m not sure what that was.  What was taught about Boley   s history in your schooling?  There was always some history because everybody had their own  personal history. If you went in the science room then, science was Dr.  Holloway. So, he would talk about his history and things that happened.  For the Ashleys, it would have been the history of their forefathers  coming over. And for the Lees, it would have been the building of the  school. So, you got your history, bits and pieces. You kind of figured  out, once you put everything together, sort of a history of what occurred  27  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  early because of conversations adults were having around you. The thing  with me is things that happened that I know about Boley, happened  during my grade school and high school years. And then I left here. I  came back in the eighties. Part of what I knew, we moved here from  California in 1955 or    56. Kids typically are not that interested in  history. You just kind of pick it up from everyone. I learned more about  history when I moved back here, I think it was     85 , than I knew before  I left.  How did you learn about black Oklahoma history, like the Tulsa Race  Riots and things like that? Was that part of your curriculum?  I didn   t take black history. Other students did. I was more interested in  science and the medical area than what goes on in the world. I know that  my husband took black history, and he was excited about it when he was  in class. We would kind of talk about things he had learned. But as far as  learning about the race riots, I learned about that when I was an adult  through television, radio, and Internet. Now, you can get on  the  computer  and go back and research it. As a kid, I think I knew that it  was like a black Wall Street, much like Boley, but in a specific area.  Boley was a whole town.  What is it about Boley that keeps people here or keeps the connection  alive?  To me, it   s family. Most of us still have family here. The land, because  the ownership of land is predominately African-American right now  although there   s a shift. Our history keeps us here, knowing what our  parents told us about this town and how it was  established . Who the  people were that were instrumental in keeping this town alive, and you  don   t want it to die. The history, you   re attached to history. If the history  dies, then you die, because all you have is present tense. So, I am very  attached to the history of the town like most everybody is here. We  know what our parents say the heydays were, what it was like. We want  to see that again. So, we work hard to try to keep that history alive for  our grandchildren. It   s the culture of the town that you   re most attached  to, how people raised their children. There are famous people all over  the world that come from Boley, Oklahoma. Seldom can you go  somewhere without knowing or finding somebody that has roots to this  community. We   re proud of that.  Why do you think people keep their connection to Boley after they leave?  It   s just like I said, there   s roots. Everybody needs roots. A tree needs  roots. We can   t put on leaves without the nourishment from the soil. I  don   t think we can live without some kind of history. I don   t know. I  28  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  Simpson  Shelton  think   ask me that question again. I think I lost my train of thought.  We talked about, what is it about Boley, and why do you think that  people keep coming back so often to Boley?  I think it   s just the love of the community and the people that are in it.  What do you think is the most important thing that people should know  about Boley?  That we   re alive and well. Things are looking up. There is hope. Hope is  alive here even though people drive down the highways and come in the  community and see the state we   re in, they don   t know what we have in  our hearts is hope that one day it will be just like it was  in the past but   better. Because I see convenient stores, I see a bank, thriving businesses  on Main Street. I see our children being entrepreneurs who give back to  the community. The good thing is that we   re teaching our children to  come back  to Boley .  How would you like to be remembered?  As a person who did all she could to make life better for everyone else  that was around her. That   s good enough for me.  Do you have any words you   d like to leave us with?  No. (Laughs) Not that I can think of right now. Words I can leave with  you    Where there is life, there is always hope. With hope, there is  always something to do. I have to be the change I want to see in this  community. I have to be the change agent. So, yes, that   s what I would  say. Be a change agent if you want to see something different.  Thank you very much, Dr. Shelton. We appreciate your time.  Okay.  ------- End of April 6, 2012 interview -------
