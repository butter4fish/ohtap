And one of the, when I was six years of age I was baptized in one of those lakes.  My father [James Finlayson, Jr.] baptized me.  It was a relatively quiet community in those days.

Speaker 1: It was right there yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, and--
Speaker 1: She started Bethune Cookman.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, she, well she was a she was a great lady by all that knew her.  They would have vespers for an example on a Sunday evening, and the auditorium would be completely packed.  And she would walk in from the back and everyone would stand.  She was a--her physical attributes was, she was not a beautiful woman, but she was. She, you know, you've probably seen pictures of her and she was just an outstanding person.
Speaker 2: Okay and, I mean, did famous people come to Bethune Cookman to speak to the students and--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you know that was during the Roosevelt administration [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] and she and Mrs. Roosevelt [Eleanor Roosevelt] were very close as a matter of fact.  And I, you know, on one such occasion when she came I got caught right between the two of 'em.  And we have picture of them, the three of us on the front page, which I've never been able to recover (laughter).
Speaker 2: Did, did they appear in the paper?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the front page of the paper.

Speaker 1: Now, did you have sense in those days, of you know when people like have reassessed I guess the life of Eleanor Roosevelt.  They talk about how important she was to the Civil Rights Movement and to humanitarian causes all over the world.  She, I mean the more people looked at it the more they see the value.  Did you have a sense of the value of her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, I mean I think everyone, you know, the country was pretty much segregated.  And many of the blacks had begun moving north during the Second War [World War II, WWII], you know, you hear that wave, going to Chicago [Illinois] or Detroit [Michigan] and other places.  And even though there was a push to integrate, President Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] was not overt in that respect but Mrs. Roosevelt assumed that role.  And so consequently she was very popular in the black community as was he as a matter of fact.  Because he, I don't remember the type of legislation that would come up in [U.S.] Congress at the time, anti-lynching maybe.  Was a, was one of the issues.
Story_ID: 633561
Speaker 1: What was the disposition of the black community in those days in terms of civil rights and--I mean in the places where you lived in Florida?  Was there a lot of tension or did people feel free?
Speaker 2: There was tension, there was, blacks knew their place.  And for the most part they tended to operate within the realm of segregated busing, segregated theaters.  And for the most part they accepted it.  I reckoned I was one of, I'm one of the exceptions in my family, cause I don't really know the movies.  And we just didn't, we didn't ride buses for the most part 'cause my mother [Alba Keys Finlayson] and father [James Finlayson, Jr.] take us places.
Speaker 1: So, what happened if you say you went to the movies, do you have to--?
Speaker 2: You sit in the balcony and sort of, sort of like segregating yourself.  So, we were--
Speaker 1: So, everybody knew that's where they were supposed to go.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, did your parents give you any special instructions about how to deal with white people when you encounter them?
Speaker 2: Yes, and they you know, they tend to go along with the custom.  But, we avoided the custom by not using public conveyances and what not.  And I never will forget when I would have difficulty with police I would be very outspoken and, and my Dad said, "Son, have to watch your mouth now," you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, were the police in the black community the white policemen, in the black community or did they have black police officers or?

Speaker 2: Yes, it did, because you didn't have an opportunity to develop friendships.  I supposed I developed more friendships in Daytona Beach [Florida] than I did in Miami [Florida].  'Cause I finished high school midterm and then I was off to college the following September.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, the classmates I had my senior year, you know, I sort of lost because I barely knew them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you get involved in student activities when you were in high school, I mean did you?
Speaker 2: Not, too much, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not, too much, we lived in Coconut Grove [Miami, Florida].  Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington Senior High School; Booker T. Washington High School] was in, the other part of Miami.  Coconut Grove was a suburban, well it's a section of Miami.  I reckon it was a suburban area, but it's part of Miami.  So, you, it's about ten miles from, from where I had, where Booker Washington was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we went there because of high schools in that section and my mother [Alba Keys Finlayson] was teaching, in the segregated school.  And the high schools--there was no good high schools in Coconut Grove.  There were good high schools but not for blacks.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Back then was a high school very close by, close to University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] where we lived.  So, I went to school farther away to Booker Washington High.
Speaker 1: Okay, now so you were involved in very few activities you said because of moving?
Speaker 2: Very few activities in high school, yeah.
Story_ID: 633564
Speaker 1: You came out of high school [Booker T. Washington Senior High School; Booker T. Washington High School, Miami, Florida] in 1940? Was it '40 [1940]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-one [1941].
Speaker 1: Forty-one [1941], okay.  Now, were they, I have to ask you this just because Florida, seemed just like a, such a volatile place for weather.  Did you ever have any problems with weather in any of those Florida towns or hurricanes, or--?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't it, didn't seem to be as prevalent.  'Cause, but I must admit I went to, see I went to Florida in '41 [1941] and I was off to college forty--September '41 [1941] and I spent two years at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And then I was off to the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Now, I don't want to get you too far before we--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you about choosing Florida A and M. Was there a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my two sisters [Columbia Finlayson and Emmie Finlayson Roberts]--
Speaker 1: How did you make that decision?
Speaker 2: --were in Florida A and M.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so it was a, it was probably the cheapest thing.  I managed to get a job in the cafeteria.  And I think my sister my freshman year, my older sister was a senior.  And the other girl I think was, I think she was a sophomore as I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you, what were your career aspirations then, I mean?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a physician.  I, the doctor that took care of us was very close to the family.  And very admired.  And he persuaded me in that direction.
Speaker 1: Now, he was a doctor in Miami [Florida]?
Speaker 2: He's a doctor in Miami.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was his name, do you?
Speaker 2: No, we was a doctor in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida]?
Speaker 2: --in Orlando [Florida], as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Orlando, okay, Orlando, all right.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what was his name?
Speaker 2: Hankins.
Speaker 1: Okay. H-A-N-K-I-N-S?
Speaker 2: H-A-N-K-I-N-S, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I went that route my first two years at Florida A and M.
Story_ID: 633565
Speaker 1: As I indicated in my sophomore year [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], which was 1942, the [U.S.] Army came in and indicated that they, if you join the enlisted reserve corps they would permit you to finish college.  So, most of the boys joined that and then they call (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So and then enlisted reserve corps?
Speaker 1: Enlisted reserve corps.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you didn't have to go in right away, you just served--
Speaker 1: Well, we--
Speaker 2: Your second year you were in enlisted reserve?
Speaker 1: We volunteered.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And you didn't have to volunteer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, we volunteered and, and most of the people on the campus was called before the end of semester.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was luckier, one of the luckier ones so they permitted me to finish the year out.  I suppose it's because of, probably because of my age I was just turned eighteen.
Speaker 2: So, so you started serving in 1943, is that right
Speaker 1: In '43 [1943].
Speaker 2: Okay, now--
Speaker 1: June of '43 [1943].
Speaker 2: So you were trained here first, right?  Did you go overseas at all, in the, in the reserve?
Speaker 1: I went to Hawaii.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was overseas then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that sounds like vacation, but--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, this was during the war though, which is?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: World War II [WWII] and then?
Speaker 1: World War II.
Speaker 2: Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii] then bombed in '41 [1941], so.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: It wasn't necessarily a vacation, then?
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 633566
Speaker 1: You went to officers candidate school [Officer Candidate School], right?
Speaker 2: Well, I went into [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was called into service.  And I went in and it was during the time there was very shortage of soldiers.  So, what they were doing was taking soldiers who could read.  And so, I went to Fort Benning, Georgia.  And they had set up a school to draft these soldiers who couldn't read.  And we taught them, the objective was to teach them reading up to the third grade level in six weeks.  These are grown men.  Men have went, men have in which have been in prison--
Speaker 1: Okay, so these, they, did they go into the prison population and pull them out?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Or did they, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, these are people who had served.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, they had finished their time in prison, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You want to pause a second and look at that picture?  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, I went in and--
Speaker 1: Oh, you were talking about teaching the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, teaching--
Speaker 1: --men to read.
Speaker 2: --teaching the illiterates.
Speaker 1: So, you could get 'em up to the third grade reading level in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We--
Speaker 1: --how, how many weeks?
Speaker 2: In six weeks.
Speaker 1: Six weeks, okay.
Speaker 2: That was the objective.  So, I did that for a year, about a year.  That was in '43 [1943], when we went in.
Speaker 1: Now, the people that you taught, the students you taught, were they mostly blacks, soldiers or what?
Speaker 2: They were black soldiers.
Speaker 1: All black soldiers, okay.
Speaker 2: All black soldiers.
Speaker 1: All right we're talking about a segregated army (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We're talking about segregated company.
Speaker 1: Completely segregated army, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I couldn't imagine you trying to teach the white ones?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Because of that segregation, you know.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I'm sure there were some whites that were illiterate as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think they had any provisions for whites in that regard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I did that for a year and then after, after which I had been promoted up to the sergeant within that period of time.
Speaker 1: So, you went in as an enlisted man there basically?
Speaker 2: Enlisted man.
Speaker 1: Just a regular, a private in--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a private.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then.
Speaker 2: So I went up--
Speaker 1: So, you were promoted to sergeant?
Speaker 2: To it was PFC [private first class], corporal, sergeant.
Story_ID: 633567
Speaker 1: Went pretty fast.  And so in 1944 I suppose, I applied for officers candidate school [Officer Candidate School].
Speaker 2: Okay, which they, which they commonly call OCS, right?
Speaker 1: OCS.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was admitted and I finished there in January '45 [1945].
Speaker 2: So, you, when you come out you're a first lieutenant or second lieutenant?
Speaker 1: Came out as second lieutenant.
Speaker 2: Second lieutenant, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think the war [World War II, WWII] was over in '45 [1945], wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Were you sent to Hawaii as a second lieutenant?
Speaker 1: I was sent there as a second lieutenant.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And we were doing guard duty, with expectation that we were going to invade Japan.
Speaker 2: But, you were never stationed in Japan?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, we were stationed in Maui [Hawaii] and Oahu [Hawaii].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so were you discharged [from the U.S. Army] in '45 [1945] or--?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I stayed in until '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I stayed in Hawaii until 1946.
Speaker 2: Okay, now are there any stories from your Hawaii tour that you can tell us, that are of interest?
Speaker 1: Well, Hawaii was well controlled by, what's the branch of service, I can't think of it?
Speaker 2: The Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] or?
Speaker 1: Marines.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Marines.  And it was kind of unusual to see that many black officers on the, on the islands.  And we would run across evidence of segregation.  We, even though we were officers they attempted to treat us as if we weren't. We didn't tolerate it.  We had our own jeeps and we drove around the island.  You go to the officers' club and they attempted to discriminate; they couldn't.  They were not segregated officers' clubs, white, but they tried to discourage you from using it by not serving you.  And that was even true of the USOs [United Service Organizations], you know.  So, for the most part it was a good experience.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did you have much interaction with the Hawaiian people?
Speaker 1: Yes, we did and they were for the most part very hospitable.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I remember one experience, we had a lady who was Hawaiian. I think she was Chinese married to a black lawyer, who was very friendly to our group.  And I was, I reckon I was dating Hawaiian women, Portuguese.  A few Portuguese on the island, dating was not a problem.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they've discovered that we didn't have tails like--
Speaker 2: That story keeps coming up, over and over again.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: In these interviews, this story that, that U.S. military, some white personnel in the U.S. military were telling everybody around the world that black soldiers had tails.
Speaker 1: We had tails.  But, their problem is that they didn't realize that we had tails that they like (laughter) anyway.  But, it was a, it was a nice experience.
Story_ID: 633568
Speaker 1: You came back in '46 [1946]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-six [1946] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To the states, okay.  Now did you intend to finish school on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], or--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, and then I went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Morehouse in 1946, now there were some very famous people there.  I think we were discussing before?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I telling you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The president of course was Dr. Benjamin Mays, right?
Speaker 2: Benjamin Mays.
Speaker 1: Yes, so.
Speaker 2: And it was, and it was fortuitous that I fell in the class with Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] not knowing that years later he'd be so famous.
Speaker 1: Well, what was he like then?  What was your impression of him?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we didn't associate that much, he was a fraternity brother.
Speaker 1: He would have been much younger right, he was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was four years younger than I.  'Cause he didn't go in, he was too young.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he went in the school when he was sixteen, was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he went to college when he was sixteen.  Because he, at that time there weren't many males at Morehouse and Dr. Mays went out into the communities across the country and gave exams to juniors and sophomore students.  And if they made a certain grade he brought them in.  And he fell in that category.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he came in, he didn't finish high school.  So, he came in early.  So, I wind up in his class.
Speaker 1: But, what class were you all in together?
Speaker 2: That was the class of '48 [1948], we had finished--
Speaker 1: Oh class, just the class of '48 [1948], not the?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we finished in '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Did you have any classes with him, in class (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Story_ID: 633569
Speaker 1: When I first went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] I went as, I changed my mind about pre-med.  I decided to go into business, pre-business.  So, my junior year in college, I took business courses.  I suppose I took some physics, but in addition I took economics and accounting, and other courses.   And I took accounting from a fellow named Blayton [Jesse B. Blayton Sr.], who's the first certified public accountant among blacks [in the State of Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Did you know of him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Blayton, he was at Morehouse, he was on the staff.  He was on the board of the, the black bank.  I'm trying to think of the name of that bank, I think it was Citizens Trust Bank [Atlanta, Georgia].  Which is one of the older established black banks in this country.  It's been around a long time.  (Unclear) Blayton taught me and I was taking accounting and I realized that I didn't really want this, business stuff.  So, I decided to change in midstream my junior year and go back to pre-med.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Surprised that I got a B plus out of his class.  I got a B in his class.  So, my senior year I was pretty well tied down with trying to get a major and a minor.  And ultimately to get out of school I got a major in math.  Well, that was a separate route to go, and a minor in chemistry.
Story_ID: 633570
Speaker 1: Did you ever encounter Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays] at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], did you meet him?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes he was a, he was a very inspirational president.  And he would, Dr. Mays would have these what do you call it, these vespers and what not once a week.  And everyone would love to go there because he was such an inspirational force.  And even though he was not a Morehouse graduate, everyone considered him a Morehouse man as we called, as we called ourselves.  And, at that time we, in our class we had a fellow named, Willie [ph.], you heard of Willie?  I'm trying to think Willie's first name.  That was another guy who was outstanding, who went on to be a professor at Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: A student?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was just, okay.
Speaker 2: In our, in our class, and I can't think of his name.
Speaker 1: I know you mentioned (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a full professor.
Speaker 1: You mentioned [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett, was one of your classmates?
Speaker 2: Lerone Bennett finished, I think Lerone shared, Lerone was in our, not in our class, I think he was a year behind us.  I think he was the class of '49 [1949].  He usually with the class of '47 [1947], class of '49 [1949].  And of course, Lerone and I got over the years to see each other periodically, and became a very good friend.
Story_ID: 633571
Speaker 1: Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] 1946 to I guess '48 [1948]. Were you there 'til '48 [1948]?
Speaker 2: Through '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And any other teachers at Morehouse you remember that, that really?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was a, there was a fellow who taught math, damn I can't think of his name.  That he was a, he was a, he was a homosexual.  And everybody knew he was a homosexual and everybody loved him.  He's one of the, outstanding teacher.  And as a matter of fact that probably was one of the reasons I was able to get a major in math in such a, virtually my senior year.  Because he was such an outstanding teacher, you know.  You go to his class and he'd make that stuff so easy.  Anyway--
Speaker 1: Oh and I was, I was also asking you about [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett before the tape ran out that you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that you met Lerone Bennett there and you all remain close friends.
Speaker 2: Well, we met, Lerone, knew each other causally in college.  But, after college we, we got to know each other very well and we still go back and forth.  He would come up and I'd go there occasionally.
Speaker 1: Okay, to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: And, Chicago.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And we have, we were in the same, we have, we were in the same fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], and with Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You familiar with the Boule?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so I would see him, he's not that active in it anymore, but neither am I as a matter of fact.
Story_ID: 633572
Speaker 1: You finished with a math major at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And now, now are you married at this time by, by this time, or are you still--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I married when I was.  No, I'm not married. I didn't marry until later.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  You at Morehouse now.
Speaker 2: I'm at Morehouse.
Speaker 1: So, so you decided to go to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] right, so?
Speaker 2: Well, that my first year out of, out of Morehouse I didn't get in medical school because I didn't, didn't have all of the grade requirements.  I had to go to summer schools to finish those.  And then take the special exam, the medical aptitude examination.  And so, I went to Washington, D.C. and stayed with a half-brother who lived there.  Fellow named Charles [Charles Finlayson], who was a labor organizer, worked for the B and O Railroad [Baltimore and Ohio Railroad].  And he worked in the dining car department.  And you may remember maybe you don't it's probably before your time.  But, back in '48 [1948] or '49 [1949], you know, the railroads was used very much.  And they had dining car facilities.  So, for a year I worked as a, worked on a club car.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he got you a job on the--?
Speaker 2: On a club car waiting.
Speaker 1: Now, he was in the union then, with A. Philip Randolph (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a union--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, A. Philip Randolph was a sleeping car.  He was in the dining car--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --section. So, I worked in the dining car, club car.  And I did that for a year.  Then I went to, went to Meharry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was in '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I, went to Meharry.
Story_ID: 633573
Speaker 1: How did you like Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Meharry was very good.  I--
Speaker 1: Now wasn't there, first of all, how many choices did you have as a black student wanting to go to medical school then, you did?  I've heard doctors talk about this how it's hard to get in a school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was very difficult to get in to most of this, most schools, other than Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and Meharry.
Speaker 1: The reason, well, I've heard that were quotas-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in most of the major medical schools, they'd only let in one black or two.
Speaker 2: They had quotas.  That's right.  And that's still persistent.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so, you had Howard, you could go to Howard, you could go to Meharry?
Speaker 2: Meharry.
Speaker 1: Those are the only places you probably could get in if you had--
Speaker 2: And if you were, if you were an exceptional student, you could, you could probably get in the University of Chicago [University of Chicago School of Medicine; Pritzker School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois], in as, you know.  I was a good student--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, and I had pretty reasonably good grades.
Story_ID: 633574
Speaker 1: I've heard some people say this and they say that the quality of instruction at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] was wonderful.  But they didn't have the equipment that a lot of places had, just didn't have it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was one of the problems.  And they, they didn't have a strong financial background obviously.  And it had its faults but somehow we managed to overcome most of them.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, I stayed there, I finished in '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Now, were there any teachers there or, or doctors there that you remember, you know that--?
Speaker 2: Well as I remember quite a few of them.  A fellow who delivered my first child was by the name Treherne [Carr Treherne]. He was an OB [obstetrics] man, was very good.  The, there was an internist who I thought a lot of.  Name was George Brothers, who's dead, so is Treherne, as a matter of fact.  There was a fellow named Matthew Walker [Matthew Walker, Sr.], who was a chairman of the department of surgery.  And very outstanding doctor, nationally and internationally.  I finished there and I stayed there and did a residency on OB/GYN [obstetrics and gynecology].
Speaker 1: Okay, this is 1953, right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--see I finished medical school in '53 [1953].  I finished my residency in '57 [1957].  After which I went to University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota].
Story_ID: 633575
Speaker 1: I want to pause here a second now, now, you got married in the interim, right, so?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: So, tell us about when you got married, how you met your wife [Edith Norman Finlayson]?
Speaker 2: Well, my wife was a, was a registered nurse at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I met her on the, on the, on this, surgical floors.  As a matter of fact she taught me how to do IVs as a student.  She had finished nursing a year or so before.  And that was my junior year at Meharry.  And we finished, trying to decided what year it was that we decided to get married.  We got married in '52 [1952]. (Pause) Because we were married forty-nine years when she passed in '01 [2001].  So, that makes it '52 [1952]. (Pause) And so, during my residency I stayed there.  And one of the, one of the considerations we had was the fact that she was over the surgical unit.  And she had a salary.  And the stipend that they paid interns and residents in those days was very minimal.  So, we managed with her salary and my stipend.  And so I stayed there for four years.  Four years of college and then another four years of my specialty in OB/GYN [obstetrics and gynecology].
Story_ID: 633576
Speaker 1: Then you went to the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: I went to University of Minnesota and I did a fellowship in OB/GYN [obstetrics and gynecology], also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was--
Speaker 1: Now what, what year is this?
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957], '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, here's a, you're young man who was raised in Florida.  You went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and then you went to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  Now you go to Minnesota, University of Minnesota.  Was that different (laughter) in anyway from--
Speaker 2: No, well by that time I think things was pretty well integrated.  Minnesota had several, one or two black residents already in their program.  And the professor of that department, name was McKelvey [John McKelvey].  He was very interested in helping with black residents to get better training.  So, he would attempt to take a fellow periodically and that's how I managed to go over there.  And it was a very good program.  And it served me very well, because when I got ready to take the specialty, specialty boards, it, I hadn't, had no difficulty.
Story_ID: 633577
Speaker 1: Did you take your boards in '58 [1958], or--?
Speaker 2: No, in, (pause) the specialty boards in that time you had to wait two years.  That is not the case now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you didn't--
Speaker 2: Most of the residents can take their specialty boards their senior year in their residency, but in those days you had to wait two years in practice.  Because before they would take you and accept you had to present so many cases.  And so you, it became it was very difficult.  Because you're out of your residency program, you're out of the discipline, reading as much and now you have to go ahead, prepare cases you have taken care of.  And present that, then study for the boards.  And of course that's what we had to do.  But--
Speaker 1: That don't seem like the most intuitive way to do it but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's what had you had to do?
Speaker 2: That's what they required.  Now, during the senior year of the, of the residency programs the, a fellow takes the time and, and study for the boards.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, so I take it you passed the boards in 1960?
Speaker 2: I don't remember when it was.  I think it was '60 [1960], it's on the, it's on my--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe it's on my thing I gave you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You say, yeah, you say you finished your fellowship [at the University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] in '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: So, if you had to wait two years to take 'em--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you don't have that stuff I gave you, do you?  I don't think you have that.

Speaker 1: You operated in private practice from '58 [1958] through 1997, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: It says--okay.  Now, where, were you associated, associated with any specific hospitals or clinics or--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was associated with St. Joseph Hospital [Wheaton Franciscan St. Joseph Campus, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and Mt. Sinai Hospital [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] (background noise), those were the two major hospitals.  And I was on the--
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: We have two medical schools in the state.  The Medical College of Wisconsin [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] which is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, wait a minute, one thing I didn't ask you was, like how did you wind up in Wisconsin instead of Minnesota?  Now, you finished in Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Well, I when I, when I did my fellowship in Minnesota [at the University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] there was a group that was being formed in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And so, I decided to try to join that group.  We worked together for a little while but it didn't gel.  So we all eventually did their own, our own practices, in OBI, I mean in OB/GYN [obstetrics and gynecology].  So, that's how I got here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I considered going to Chicago [Illinois], and, but this seemingly was a fertile ground.  They had very few, I don't think had but one, maybe one other OB/GYN man, black OB/GYN man, in the city at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I came here and practiced, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In forty-nine--thirty-nine, forty years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you had your own practice until 1997, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: But, I didn't practice in '58 [1958].  So, it was thirty-nine years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, well what all right so there's only two black O, OBs--
Speaker 2: Well, at that time there was only one other black OB/GYN man.  He was at a different hospital.  And as time passed I was able to get some help.  Because OB/GYN was a, get to, it was a pretty trying specialty, because you're on call all twenty-four hours--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a day.
Speaker 1: Because of people having babies and such?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: So, in a period of time we got other OB people coming in.  And over a period of years I had three or four different type, different partners who worked with me.  And it was during this time that I became affiliated with both medical schools as a clinical professor, assistant professor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Medical College of Wisconsin and the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin Medical School; University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health], which is in Madison [Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was good because the hospitals that I worked had, had training programs, had residency programs.  So, not having someone to cover me as frequently as one would have liked.  There was always someone at the hospital that was competent, that's been well trained.  So, if I was, if I was a little late making the delivery, I didn't have to be, didn't have to worry, a great deal.  So, it worked out very well.
Story_ID: 633579
Speaker 1: I know that the whole practice has changed a lot since the days, that you were, you first, you first started practicing.  People are opting for a lot of different, natural child birth, and you know, the whole, the whole--I know when, when my children were born in the '80s [1980s], you know, that, the whole thing had started, really started change--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where doctors were advocating breast feeding on the part of the mother.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And or childbirth mess- methods or, thinking the days when you started, as I recall the, just from watching TV.  And hearing stories from people that, the father would sit in the waiting room and pace and the mother would go back and she'd be knocked out basically and the baby was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --delivered and--do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a, it became consumer friendly.  We encouraged fathers to participate--
Speaker 1: That's later, right?
Speaker 2: --in the delivery.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, in the beginning when you started, the fathers were kept out of the picture (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, that's right.  But as time passed we let fathers come into C sections [Cesarean section].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell us maybe why things, how they got to that point where the fathers weren't involved at all, because of the, because I--remember, is it--I mean, before modern hospitals a lot of people had children at home and on the farm or something.  And the doctor would come or maybe a midwife.  But, you know, by the time, you know, medicine hit the '50s [1950s], it was like a, you know, very much a processed kind of a deal.  And can you, do you know why it got like that, or how it came to that?
Speaker 2: Well initially as, as you indicate we did have deliveries at home but midwives for the most part.  And then later on there were a few doctors who delivered at home during one period.  But, that was relatively short period because, and frequently we had, the outcome wasn't good.
Speaker 1: So, a lot--
Speaker 2: So, people started gravitating back to the hospital.  We continued to use midwife, various midwives in the hospital.  But, they would have to be under the supervision of a, of a physician and that's basically the way it's going now.  And then some of them do very well.  And then of course doing, initially we didn't let fathers come in because of the problem with medical legal fears.  But, as time passed we, again I'm sure we continue to do, permit the fathers to come in during preparation for, during, during the pregnancy.  And during the labor and delivery room.  And as I indicated, we let fathers come in to, in the labor room for the C sections.  And we sometimes give the baby to the father after, so it's changed somewhat.
Speaker 1: So, you, do you think it's changed for the better?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think so. I don't think it's, I don't think there's any, real, we haven't had any problems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it's been ten years since I practiced, and I'm, I'm sure that's going on still.
Story_ID: 633580
Speaker 1: What were some of the, the black communities always had the highest rate of infant mortality and the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is it, what are some of the reasons for that do you think?
Speaker 2: The reason is that more often than not the patient didn't get to the doctor until late in the pregnancy.  So, the risk of maintaining a healthy pregnancy is minimized.  And pretty often they get in and the blood pressure may be high and if you had caught it earlier we could have prevented such problems as toxemia.  We could pick up diabetes and that type of thing.  So, it's a matter, of care.
Speaker 1: Okay, we just don't get the same medical care?
Speaker 2: We just don't get the same medical care, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or it's harder to get, to take advantage of?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, I guess what, what other I guess major health issues did you have to deal with as a, as a OB/GYNie [obstetrics and gynecology] doctor in the black community, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, during pregnancy, bleeding is always a problem and, before and after delivery.  You have to be very alert about I imagine the most common types of problems was sexually transmitted diseases in, especially young females, like chlamydia, herpes, (unclear). So, what we do routinely, I did on a routine visit, we routinely do smears for, unless a patient prefers not to get it, for just about all of these things.  And you can pick up just about all the sexually transmitted disease by a sample smear that we have available.  And the other thing is early, pick up early cancer, chlamydia was, well not chlamydia, the papillomavirus [human papillomavirus] which you may have read about.  They've been trying to push a vaccine to prevent papillomavirus infections.  Which ultimately was, well not ultimately but more often than not will cause early cancer in women.  And so, those are the main things-
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: --In a GYN practice.
Speaker 1: Okay now I heard some disturbing news yesterday.  We were interviewing a retired social worker [HistoryMaker June M. Perry] and she said that Milwaukee [Wisconsin] had the highest rate of teen pregnancy in the nation.  And, you know, I said, "I didn't realize that." Is that, is that--
Speaker 2: At one time they did. I thought it had gone down.  At one time it really did, but it was, it was especially true among the black teenagers.  But, it's not only true among the black teenagers increasingly it's true among the white teenagers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course that's a problem.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now correct me if I'm wrong but I think teen pregnancies are more risky than other, I mean, pregnancies when a woman's more mature.
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's more risky because they, the teenagers are not as diligent in seeing the doctor and that type of thing, I think that's the main reason.
Story_ID: 633581
Speaker 1: Were you still practicing when the AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] epidemic started up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, how old is the AIDS epidemic now, it's got to be twenty years old now, isn't it?
Speaker 1: I guess it started, people started talking about it in the, in the early '80s [1980s], right '83 [1983], '84 [1984] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --is when they started discussing it and--
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, oh yeah.  And we checked for it, if we had permission, you can't at that time, I don't know whether it's true now, but you have to notify the patient if you're gonna, gonna do the test.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you couldn't do it without telling 'em you were gonna--
Speaker 2: As I recall, we had to notify them that we're doing it.
Speaker 1: So, the, you, what you're implying is that it's different from other diseases. You couldn't, I mean other diseases you could check for on your own, but you had to notify the patient if you were gonna check for AIDS?
Speaker 2: I think so, because it was a such a bad disease we, the fear among some patients was that it was common knowledge it would affect their ability to work and what not.  And you know (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, it's such a stigma attached to it?
Speaker 2: Right such a stigma attached.  And then there was a fear that if in earlier years that if they were around with somebody with AIDS, they can catch it.  You remember the first few years and then of course in sports if you got a little blood on you, you know, you had to come out and cover that up and what not.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Which was probably a good thing.
Speaker 1: Well, you remember when like, Karl Malone refused to play against Magic Johnson because (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah, I remember it very well.  But--
Speaker 1: So, was AIDS education a big part of your practice in those days, and, or--?
Speaker 2: Not really, it was a part of it, we, you know.  Every patient, we discuss the need, especially a person who comes in with some sexually transmitted disease.
Story_ID: 633582
Speaker 1: Is there any particular diseases that affect in your field that affect black people more or have more of a devastating impact on the community.  Or, what's the biggest problem, I guess, in the black community in terms of, you know?
Speaker 2: In my field?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, we get a, I, in the low income area, which is where, was where I worked.  Sexually transmitted disease was a major problem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Diabetes, most, even though I was an OB/GYN [obstetrics and gynecology] man, every patient came in my office we usually took a urine specimen for two reasons, one so they would empty their bladder and two we would stick it for the routine things that we check for including sugar.  So, just about everybody in practice would get a stick and pick up and we'd pick up glucose sugar in their urine.  We made diagnoses that for the, that the patient didn't know about prior to that.  So, we'd pick up an occasional diabetic, which is more prevalent among, among blacks.  And of course uterine fibroids, is probably more common among blacks.  This is a tumor of the uterus.  And so that's a little more common especially in the thirty years and older.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have heard that.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I heard that, yeah.
Story_ID: 633583
Speaker 1: Business wise, were you partnered up with other doctors in your practice or did you have--?
Speaker 2: Periodically I've had partners and we've covered each other.  And in my first ten years of practice my coverage was very sporadic and for the most part, I had to rely on white physicians to cover me.  And it wasn't until later years that we could reciprocate.  That's when they would go away then I'll cover him and--
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's due to, to racial discrimination?
Speaker 2: Racial probably.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, they would cover me, but when they wanted someone to cover them, they may go elsewhere.
Speaker 1: But, if you try to cover them then there'd be an issue?
Speaker 2: But, if they would I would have no inclination to do more work (laughter) for them.  But, it seems fair if I cover, if they cover me, that I would reciprocate.  But, I wasn't asked to reciprocate often.  Later on there was one guy and I, used to cover each other-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --quite a bit.
Story_ID: 633584
Speaker 1: As a young black professional you're a doctor, that's considered the highest level of achievement by a lot of black people in communities, it's a high social standing.  Now, we've discussed the housing crisis in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] with [HistoryMaker] Vel Phillips and other people.  Were you a part of that movement to, you know, the, with the crisis here with housing?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I was, I was, I would march with some of the groups in those with Father Groppi [James Groppi] was there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well what were your impressions of Father Groppi and Vel, you know, Vel Phillips?
Speaker 2: Father Groppi was an outstanding unselfish priest and I will never forget he was, he was probably more outspoken and, than any of the black politicians.  To the point where the Catholic diocese used to chastise him.  And I remember there were several of us who went to the archbishop's home to discuss his holyship.  Because the church had become involved with it because of Father Groppi and, but he was obviously just an outstanding leader.  And of course Vel Phillips has been one of the outstanding people in this community over the years.  She was on a, probably one of the first blacks on our city council [Common Council of Milwaukee] and then she was a, as I recall she was a judge for a short period of time.  Then she was a, I think she was secretary of state, if I'm not mistaken.  I stand corrected but I know she had a state position.  And she's still active, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think she's in her nineties now, I think or close to it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Vel must be up there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Vel's gotta be up there.  Yeah, I think she's older than I.
Speaker 1: So, how long was before housing kind of loosened up. Did you--?
Speaker 2: Let me see what year was that now.  Well, shortly after that the next, it remained a problem for a long time.  And it was perpetuated by the real estate people.
Speaker 1: Did it stay a problem through the whole '60s [1960s], or all the '60s [1960s], or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well what was, what was happening theoretically there were no laws passed.  As I recall, but the real estate agents would direct you or steer you places.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I remember when we, when we bought our first house, which was in 1950 maybe 1960 around there.  It was difficult.  I attempted to buy a lot in a section that was, that was, well it wasn't integrated it was all black (unclear) and they'd, they discovered I had a white fellow to make a bid and they discovered that it was a black guy behind it.  So, they denied me and I subsequently bought a lot which, much closer to where I did my work.  And I have, well any citizen is a problem in certain sections of the community.  But, they'd still steer you.
Story_ID: 633585
Speaker 1: You do have some background in business and in 1971 you were a part of the development of this bank [North Milwaukee State Bank, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] that we're sitting in today.  Tell us how that got started?
Speaker 2: Well, when I came to town and rented an apartment for my family, I had very little money.  And I went to minority and went to major banks to make a loan to upgrade the wiring, the electrical wiring in this house that I was buying.  And I could not get a loan for that purpose.  And I finally, I think the electric company finally put it on my bill and I paid it off that way.  In the meantime, there was a, there was a young lady who worked at one of the banks, who talked to her people at this particular bank about a minority bank, and they encouraged her.  So, her pastor got a group together and the original group, I don't even think I was a part of, when I ultimately became a part of it.  And there were two groups at the time that was vying for a minority bank.  I reckon that was in 1969, 1970.  And we went to the state banking commission [Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions] and he had to decide based on the composition of the respective groups, who to give the charter to, award the charter to.  And so we were awarded the charter.  And then after being awarded the charter, then our next job was to, was to capitalize it.  And at that time the, the capitalization that was required was only five hundred thousand dollars.  Can you just imagine?  Which was a lot of money I reckon in those days.  And so we went out and tried to get the capital and we, we said no one could purchase than twenty-five thousand.  And we had difficulty raising capital, five hundred thousand dollars in capital.  So there were two of us who, two physicians.  And, that was a part of the group and the bank that was assisting us came to us and said, "Look fellas we were unable to raise the capital.  I'm wondering if you guys would consider putting in much more maybe three times more than anyone else."  So, that's what we did, so we borrowed money from the, this bank.  And we put in considerably more, the two of us.  By that time the board had been constituted.  And did not reflect the greater financial impact that the two of had.  So, we started off with a board and the first president was a former surgeon and he was a fella named Chaney [Felmers O. Chaney].  He was the first president, the first chairman of the board.  And the composition of the board was, was loyal to him.  Rather than to the two of us who had but the most of the, good percentage of the money.  So, over a period time, over a period of a couple of years.  We had to change the composition of the board.  That would be more sympathetic to where we thought the bank should be going.  And that's ultimately what we did.  Then I became the chairman right after that.  And I virtually directed this thing as chairman of the board over a period of years.  At one point we had to recapitalize again and my wife got involved at the time.  And, so here we are.
Story_ID: 633586
Speaker 1: This is actually the first black bank in Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: There was, there was a saving and loans bank, which is called Columbia Savings [Columbia Savings and Loan Association, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  Which was started maybe twenty or thirty years before.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. This was the first full service bank?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is, first full service bank, right.
Speaker 1: Now, as the first black bank, did, now this was set up as a not for profit bank, was it, or a community bank?
Speaker 2: No, it's a, it's a profit bank.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess a community bank or I guess, or special kind of bank (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's not a community bank. We have stockholders and I, there are two us, who, who have minority control of (unclear) stock.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what kind of projects does the, has the bank [North Milwaukee State Bank, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] supported over the years, you know, that--
Speaker 2: We--
Speaker 1: --that you're the most proud of?
Speaker 2: We've done a lot of work in the churches.  And I reckon that's where we've done, that's been the base of much of our support over, over the years.  To the point that, the regulators say we, too much invested in one segment.  But, we've over a period of years, we've gotten a lot of support from the churches and we've supported them.  And there have been a number of businesses that we've assisted and some of them have done well and some have not well.
Speaker 1: What kind of business does, seems to fair the best?
Speaker 2: I started to say restaurant but I don't think that's the case.  We've had a couple of businesses (unclear), trying to think of the terminology where they produce some industrial production.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On part (unclear) for some of the--
Speaker 1: Oh okay supplies for, yeah--
Speaker 2: Suppliers right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That type of thing.
Speaker 1: So funded minority suppliers to--
Speaker 2: To major--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's been the, one that has been most successful.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  I know there, there are quite a few minority suppliers for the auto industry and they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know if they have them for the brewing industries or not.  That's a big deal.
Speaker 2: Well, they do have 'em. They had a lot of brewers here at one point. We don't anymore.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, we didn't invest in that so much.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so.
Speaker 2: And now we got a fellow, our president now has been with us less than a year.  Pretty sharp guy, you saw him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Erbert Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.?
Speaker 2: E-R-B-E-R-T, Erbert Johnson.  A certified public accountant, and is very sharp.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a female prior to him.
Speaker 1: And you're currently chairman emeritus?
Speaker 2: I'm chairman emeritus.  I gave up the chairmanship in April--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of this year.
Story_ID: 633587
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point in life, all your activities, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would go to--I'd go to Atlanta [Georgia] (laughter).  I don't know, place has been good for us.  My wife was a, I think I told you she passed but she was very active in the community and she was well known.  In the general communities, I was in the medical community.  She was on the Board of Regents [of the University of Wisconsin System] and outstanding lady.  So it was, it was, it was good for us.  I had two boys, one of which is a school teacher in one of the junior colleges [Milwaukee Area Technical College, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And the other one is a musician.
Speaker 1: Now what's your wife's name?  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Edith, E-D-I-T-H. Finlayson [Edith Norman Finlayson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have two son and what are their names?
Speaker 2: I have two sons Reginald [Reginald Finlayson] and Tony [Anthony Finlayson].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They call themselves something different.
Speaker 1: They call themselves something different?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Tony called himself, what does he call himself? I can't even think of it.
Speaker 1: Do they have African names or what, or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, are they involved in a movement, or something or--?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Are they involved in a movement or just a--?
Speaker 2: No, they're just, they're just active.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: My memory is not as sharp as it should be.
Speaker 1: It happens to us all (laughter).
Story_ID: 633588
Speaker 1: When you think about the black community, what are some of your hopes and concerns today?
Speaker 2: (Pause) The teenagers, the young people.  Fifteen years ago I started a group called the W.E.B. Du Bois Club.  And it was, the purpose of the club was twofold, was to develop leaders and to develop a knowledge of black history through the eyes of W.E.B. Du Bois.
Speaker 1: Now when did you found this organization?
Speaker 2: Well, fifty years ago, the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity].
Speaker 1: Fifteen year?
Speaker 2: Fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, it's been in existence for fifteen years now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's called the W.E.B. Du Bois Club, it was started by the Boule.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And someone appointment me the chairman of the social action committee.  And, and this is the thing, that I, when I started and we got a group of guys, about four of five us mentors and most of those guys are still active in the group.  And we meet twice a month from, one and a half hours, talk about the subjects.  They have their own club. We have a investment component, where we give the kids a, initially we used to give a several thousand dollars; we still do.  And they invest the money and at the end of the year, we look at the, the portfolios and divide it on the seniors that's going out.  In the past--
Speaker 1: Okay, so let me get this straight now.  The members of the organization, they come up with this, with the money themselves or the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, the Boule comes up with the money.
Speaker 1: The Boule comes up with the initial money then it's invested it and it grows?
Speaker 2: The initial money and then we take--we give the money to the kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They invest it.
Speaker 1: So, you don't give it individually to each kid?
Speaker 2: No, not individually.
Speaker 1: As a group, right?
Speaker 2: As a group.
Speaker 1: It goes into their account and--
Speaker 2: They go in their account and at the end of the year.  And we're not doing this as much in the past two or three years.  But, the end of the year we used to look at the size of the portfolio and divide the shares and the seniors would benefit.  And we'd buy their shares from them.  More recently we have been just giving thousand dollar scholarships to seniors.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is a, so that seems like a great idea though.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: To, you know, to, so you use the money that was earned to, to help send them to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they get, so now we--
Speaker 1: Scholarships?
Speaker 2: Seniors if they stick with us four years, we start taking them in the ninth grade, not necessarily if they come later, that will be fine.  But, if a child comes with us four years and at the end of the four years he could be assured of a thousand dollar scholarship, right now.  We meet from October through May.  We have speakers. For example, this Saturday, we got a banker who's coming in that's going to talk about investments.  And you're gonna, this is probably a good time to do, to invest.
Story_ID: 633589
Speaker 1: We just experienced the biggest stock market crash since the Great Depression.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And right now as we speak here in 2008.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And so, the country, in fact the federal government's gotta bail out the investors, and I mean the stock market, you know, as we speak.  And it's been to the tune of $800 billion, so far right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: You're saying it's a good time now to invest?
Speaker 2: Yeah, now it's a good time to invest.  Someone was telling me the other day, say, "Man I'm invest at General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company]. They're, they're not going bankrupt."  And the stock is what, is it two dollars and half?
Speaker 1: Is it?
Speaker 2: I understand that it's down to two dollars and something.  I'm tempted to take five thousand dollars and invest myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause they're on the verge of being bailed out, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're gonna be bailed out.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You can't let, you can't let your industrial base go down the drain.  And that's a large--

Speaker 1: I was asking about the old Socialist or Communist Du Bois Club [W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs of America], and I don't know if you're aware of that or not.  But, it's a--
Speaker 2: No, I'm not aware of that. I do know that the, they accused him of being a Communist.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he actually was, I mean, he said he was I think--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that at towards the end. He had gone through many transformations in his life.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned the Henry Louis Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] presiding over the W.E. Du Bois center for African American studies [Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research; W.E.B. Du Bois Research Institute] at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: One of the things we do for this club [W.E.B. Du Bois Club], we give the boys a book on 'The Souls of Black Folks' ['The Souls of Black Folk,' W.E.B. Du Bois] and my son is, who is a history bug, goes through different chapters in the course of the year, and that's one of the things we do in there.  And got the investment leadership and we talk about the current subjects.  Last, just before the election we had one of the politicians come in and talk about the Electoral College.  And so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, as you, yeah as you mentioned 'The Souls of Black Folk,' I think a couple of years ago, maybe in 2006, they had a, there was national campaign to reread the, it was the hundredth anniversary of 'Souls of Black Folk.'
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And people were rereading it.  I think it was 2006.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It might have been 2005, I'm not sure but, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's see.
Speaker 1: But there was--
Speaker 2: It was '6 [2006] probably [sic. 2003].
Speaker 1: There's several new additions of 'Souls of Black Folk' published and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --critiqued by people.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I'm reminded we got to buy some for the newest group of boys.  We give everybody one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We buy everybody a book.

Speaker 1: You also mentioned that you went to Ghana several years ago, I mean and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went, I went there about oh, I reckon about, I went over there with Reverend Sullivan group.
Speaker 1: Oh Reverend Leon Sullivan?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sullivan, you know the, he, OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers] had this thing going to Africa every couple of years for a while.  Trying to, I went over and spent a week.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I went over with that group.
Speaker 1: Oh, with Leon Sullivan?
Speaker 2: The OIC and Leon Sullivan.
Speaker 1: The OIC, okay, all right, okay.  And did you, and we, I guess you will mention that, mentioning that in regards to W.B. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] died and then buried in Ghana, and being a part of that government for a while.
Speaker 2: Right, right, and I, and we went to his home that they had, they had established there.
Speaker 1: Right, Dr. Du Bois, I think he, the day he died was the day of the March on Washington in 1963 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's what I understand, yeah.

Speaker 1: That sounds like a wonderful program for youth. I mean how do youth get involved do they--?
Speaker 2: Well, we just started it. We wrote it up and we presented it to the group and they decided to fund it.  And they fund it every year.  They give us twenty-five hundred dollars a year for the group [W.E.B. Du Bois Club].
Speaker 1: So, the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] does?
Speaker 2: The Boule does.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you that's the money you can use to invest in?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And then we have the kids to put in five dollars a meeting.  We elect, they elect their own officers, they have bylaws.  And that's, it's a very, very nice program.
Speaker 1: It sounds like it's real developmental kind of--
Speaker 2: And we won, I gather we've gone to the Boule and we've been, we won the award for the outstanding program about four or five times.
Speaker 1: So how do you recruit students, I mean, the young men for the, how do they--?
Speaker 2: We've been going to the, a couple of the magnet schools.  Most of the kids that we are getting are college prep, we're geared for the college prep.  Our group is, don't want to get their hands too dirty.  So, we have to do a (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, so, I mean, but yeah, it's a segment of, I mean a lot of people I know in the black community wanted to help the children that are at the most risk.  But, at the same time we have children that have advantage but no direction.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you're saying you're really trying to help those who--
Speaker 2: We--
Speaker 1: They drift if you don't (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, well we take--
Speaker 1: Or if the talented have, right--
Speaker 2: We decide we can do just so much.  So, we gonna take a sliver (gesture) of society that we can have an impact.  And that's the way we look at it.
Speaker 1: For those who are ready to, for these lessons are--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --are the ones who--
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 633593
Speaker 1: Is there any other programs we, you need to, we, you want to discuss before we--I go, I take it any further, because you've done some things that I don't, I don't know about.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm active with several groups over the years, the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], several medical groups.  I started I started an HMO. [health maintenance organization] while I was president of the Cream City Medical Society [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] back in 1970.
Speaker 1: Is that the?
Speaker 2: That's a black medical group.
Speaker 1: Yeah, part of the National Medical Association?
Speaker 2: Right, and we started a, what we call the Cream City Medical Society, Cream City, I'm trying to think of the name of the group now.  It was funded for about three years.  And then it was defunded.
Speaker 1: Is that one of the names for Milwaukee [Wisconsin], the Cream City?
Speaker 2: Cream City.  I'm trying to think of the full name, I think we just called it Cream City.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I've, I forgot this is the dairy land, this is the dairy state, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is but, well it was, Cream, the name comes from the bricks that was common, and common to use in building buildings.  Cream colored bricks that's where the Cream City came from.
Speaker 1: No, that, yes, sir your right. I mean, I, I can, I see a connection to the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yesterday we were downtown in a place called the Turner club [Turner Hall Restaurant, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and the legend on the wall says it's made out of cream colored bricks or something, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It described the bricks, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Back in the turn of the century, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, were you interviewing someone yesterday, too?
Speaker 1: No, we were having lunch. That's all (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just happened to, you know, recognize the place as a historical place--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --downtown, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's right across from the Bradley Center [BMO Harris Bradley Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], isn't it?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So were you a part of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], here too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm a life member of them, NAACP.  And the Urban League [National Urban League] and all the usual things, active in church and chairman of the trustee board at church early on.  I used be the vice president of the United Community Service [United Community Services].
Story_ID: 633594
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything, all these activities, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think the bank [North Milwaukee State Bank, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] really had the greatest impact.  And it required some persistence and some commitment.  You had to put your money in it.  And I think that's the thing that.  I know the other guy who was the other doctor I was talking about, he has some ambivalence about it accepting the fact that he's a, he's a founder.  And I, and I remind him that I may not have been in the first meeting but I was, I laid the foundation for the bank.  And so that's--I think that's the thing that I feel best about.  That's gonna have a long standing. It's going to be long standing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us a little bit more about your family you say, you say you, your wife [Edith Norman Finlayson] passed away in 2001, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you have two sons [Reginald Finlayson and Anthony Finlayson]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the older boy he's a, he finished Swarthmore [Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania] and he's teaching at MATC.  Are you familiar with it, that's in (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, in Milwaukee Area Technical College [Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's, then, then I have my second son, he's a, he's a Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] graduate.  And he has a group, a musical group that he's active in.  Neither one of them making any money, but they enjoy what they're doing.  I have a daughter who was conceived in another situation before I got married.  Who, was reared by her mother, who's--lives in Annapolis, Maryland. Her mother is dead.  And she is, she and I are very close.  We go back and forth.  She was the, she's the old- oldest child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't rear her.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it's good to be connected with her now?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah she's really a just a wonderful person.  She's a retired school teacher, who's on the city council of Annapolis, Maryland, very active in politics.
Speaker 1: Okay and you say your sister [Columbia Finlayson] lives with you now too, right?
Speaker 2: My sister was, was living in Washington.  My mother [Alba Keys Finlayson] and sister they left.  My mother won a home in Miami [Florida].  And when she got up in age, she decided that we should fix this house up in Washington, D.C., where my youngest sister [Emmie Finlayson Roberts] lived, that had fall, almost fallen down.  So, they invested some money in it, they renovated the whole thing.  And they moved up to Washington, my mother and my older sister.  And mother passed in '95 [1995]. I reckon they moved up there in '92 [1992], '93 [1993], and then my younger sister passed last year.  So, the only person that was left in the house, it's a big house, was my older sister and a niece, who's rarely there.  And I'm living by myself in a fairly big house and so I asked her to come stay with me.  So, she stays with me and she's got the run of the house, and you know, she's comfortable.

Speaker 1: Do you have any advice for, our young people now, who either want to become a doctor or to start a, or who want start a financial institution?
Speaker 2: I would think that if they have the inclination to serve people, medicine is a good field.  Whether it's as a physician or a nurse or otherwise.  It's not (unclear), it's very expensive to become a physician.  And the way the economics is going unless they make some changes as far as the cost of education, it's gonna be prohibitive to practice successfully, financially, successfully.  Most people that finish medical schools they owe, owe so much, it's not unusual I've heard of three or four hundred thousand dollars, you know.  Which is, and they're talking about reducing the cost of medicine. They're reducing the fees and they're paying doctors and what not.  So, the, the people that are in primary care medicine, they're on the lowest ring of the financial scale.
Speaker 1: But, the specialists make more?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it's gonna be very difficult for those types, those guys to practice primary care.  And pay the insurance rates and do very well.  So, I've just, listening last evening about primary care physicians going down, the number.  Because it's, because they're not being paid.
Speaker 1: Do you have any thoughts about universal healthcare and the plans (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I don't see how you can avoid it. I don't see how you can.  I don't see how we can expend, I don't know how, what percentage of the dollar goes into health, but it has to be just an exorbitant sum.  And certainly compared to other countries it's, pretty prohibitive and it's going up.  You can't, you know, we just can't do it.
Speaker 1: Do you like the plan that President Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] put forth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's, a good start, I sort of like Hillary's [Hillary Rodham Clinton] better.  But I think that's a good start.  They gonna have to do, there's gonna have to be a great deal of shake out over a period of years on this, on this thing.  But they ought to get started somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and what was your other question about?
Speaker 1: Oh about financial institutions, yeah.
Speaker 2: Financial?  If they have an inclination I can think of some other better investments (laughter).  But if they have the inclination and the training I think it's a good field.  I think, since we've had this bank [North Milwaukee State Bank, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] we've had several crises in banking.  I think we had a, during the Carter administration [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], there was a slight crisis.  I dare say if I invested the money in something differently maybe I would have done better I don't know.  I, I it's a sound investment at this point.  Whether it's, I think it's a good investment, they have to like what they're doing.
Story_ID: 633596
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Maybe I'll ask it for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I'm just kidding (laughter). No I don't think of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would to be remembered as a person who's made a difference in the life of those that will follow.  We're talking about the Du Bois Club [W.E.B. Du Bois Club] on an occasion recently and the guys asked me, one of the mentors asked, "Finn [HistoryMaker Dr. William Finlayson], what do you want to accomplish with the Du Bois Club?"  I said, "Well, you know, I don't think we have developed a technique to evaluate how effective it has been.  But, it's my hope that the boys will learn something and make their life better."  And I won't be able to prove it in writing, because, you know, we made no effort to follow the boys to see how successful they've been and that type of thing.  But, if we can influence them someway and it's sounded like, what is that on the, on the, the pebble on the water and hopefully there'll be some good results.
