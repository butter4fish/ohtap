 Finchum  Today is June 26, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in  Bristow, Oklahoma to speak with Carolyn Foster, and this is part of our  100 Year Life project. Thank you so much for having us today. Let   s  start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  I was born in 1912 in Saint Jo, Texas.  And what month?  December.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  Now?  Then.  Oh, at that time. I was the only one born, I was the only one born. I was  their first child.  And then how many did they have after you?  Two more.  Two more. Brothers or sisters?  Girls.  So three girls in the family. And did you grow up on a farm?  5  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  They were periods when we lived in rural life, but other time periods we  lived in town.  So what did your father do for a living?  He was a banker when he would work in town, and when he worked out  in the country, he was working the fields.  And what did he work in the fields doing? Raising cotton or what?  I think he was raising food stuffs.  Okay. And where did you go to elementary school?  Saint Jo, Texas.  In a one-room schoolhouse?  There were two rooms, and I was in the advanced room, in the older  folks    room. (Laughter)  Smarter than the other ones, huh?  Yeah.  Then your dad taught part of that.  My dad taught school part of the time, and he worked in the bank part of  the time.  And did your mother work outside of the home?  No.  And high school, did you graduate from high school?  Yes.  And do you remember what year? Probably 1930. Does that sound  about right?  Well, I   m trying to think.  Well, you were fifteen.  I was sixteen.  6  Diehl  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Bishop  Sixteen.  So 1928, then, around in there, right when the Depression was  beginning. Do you remember going to school the first couple of days,  what that was like? Did your father take you or did you go by yourself?  Well, my mother took me.  Your mother took you.  Depends on the occasion. If I was going where my father was teaching,  he took me. Now, see, there   s two situations here.  How would you get there?  I rode horseback.  About how far was it from your home to school?  About two miles.  And do you remember much from those early years in school?  Yeah. I remember lots of things.  Recess?  Yes.  Some of the games you may have played?  Uh-huh. Some of the books I read.  And what would you do for lunch?  Lunch? Well sometimes   let   s see. Those early years, we didn   t have a  cafeteria. We had to take our lunch, so I carried a lunch in a bag, in a  sack, or in a wicker basket.  And what would it be?  It   d be sandwiches and cookies and fruit.  I want to know, what were some of the games kids would play at recess?  7  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Bishop  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Diehl  Bishop  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  It   s one of those games where you touch somebody and     Tag.  You   re it   Oh, Tag  You   re it   Tag. Hmm.  Did they have Christmas programs and things like that at the school?  No, they usually had it during school hours. If you stayed after school,  you missed your ride or threw the riding schedule off.  Were you in 4-H?  No. No, honey, that long ago in a little country community they didn   t  have 4-H.  So when you got out of high school, what did you do?  I went to college.  Where?  Oh, that town there clear across the     Denton.  Denton, Texas.  What   s now the University of North Texas?  Yeah, I think so.  Texas Women   s.  Oh, Texas Women   s?  Uh-huh. Texas Women   s University.  Okay. And you got a degree in education?  Well, I went there two years, but then I got married and moved to  Oklahoma.  8  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Well, you moved to Oklahoma before you got married, but that   s all  right.  I got mine in education and planned to teach school.  Well, and did you teach school?  Sooner or later. (Laughter)  And what did your husband do for a living?  Well, it was about the time that the war bells rang, and he was called in  to the Army down in San Anton  San Antonio , so I went with him.  And so he was in World War II?  Yes.  Did you work while he was in the war?  No, by that time I had three children.  So you worked but not out of the house. And were they boys or girls?  They were all girls.  No, no, no, no.  No, your children.  Oh. Well, what were they? One girl and two boys. (Laughter)  That   s a little bit, awhile ago. It   s been awhile.  Yeah.  Well, when you were growing up, was church an important part of your  life?  Mm-hmm.  Went every Sunday?  Mm-hmm, we went.  9  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  And what were some of the things you would do for fun?  I read books, and I went on walks and visited the neighbors, and  anything else kids do.  Did you go to dances?  No, I don   t think I ever went to a dance.  Until college.  I don   t think we ever   oh, when I got into college I went to dances.  And did your mother can, grow a garden and can?  Mm-hmm.  And I understand your grandfather was W. D. Bentley, the first director  of Extension for Oklahoma? Do you remember much about him?  Yes, I thought he was a very handsome old man. He had gray hair and a  nice vocabulary. He made us feel he loved the grandchildren, and he  valued them and expected big things out of them.  So did he live very close by?  Well, part of the time, and part of the time he lived clear across the state.  Would you go visit him for holidays?  Mm-hmm, or they   d come visit us.  Well, once your children got into school, is that when you went to work?  It was after the war was declared and my husband was called into duty  down in San Anton. I did do some little outside work to get some  spending money for the children.  What type of work?  Substitute teaching.  What was the subject you would teach?  Where I was concerned, there was no subject but English. (Laughter)  10  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  I better watch how I say things, then.  Yes, I   ll correct it. I stay in the habit here. I   m breaking all these locals  working for me. (Laughter)  Does that mean you were a pretty good speller?  Yeah, I would think that.  Did you have to discipline the children?  Very little.  And if you did, how would you? Would you paddle?  No, I didn   t paddle. I told them about their sins.  She kept me after school one day.  Did you ever have to teach your children? Were they in your class?  Yeah, sometimes.  How was that?  It didn   t matter to me, except I got to compare how some of mine were  smarter than the locals were.  And did you ever have to discipline them, your own children, while they  were in your class?  With a tongue lashing.  Never made them write lines?  No, I felt writing lines was some foolish labor.  Would you teach cursive writing?  Yeah.  They don   t do that too much anymore.  Well, they do it some, especially old-fashioned teachers.  So where did you teach?  11  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Well, out in the country, and we rode bareback, my husband and I did,  not bareback but     No.     with the saddle, cross Mud Creek to get across over into Texas where  the school was.  That was your daddy not your husband.  Huh?  That   s your dad.  Yeah, my daddy. My father was a teacher.  And then you wanted to be a teacher.  Yeah, because I had teachers on both sides. Our family   s lousy with  schoolteachers. (Laughter)  So after the war did you move to Oklahoma?  We moved back to Oklahoma. My  husband  moved back to Oklahoma,  and he got a new bank in Bristow, and we built a home out in the  country.  Let   s back up a minute and let you tell me how you met your husband.  Well, let me think. That   s been so long ago.  Did he go to school with you?  No   yeah, he went to school. His family hadn   t been particularly  interested in education. They hadn   t gone on to advance. He was the  one   they lived down where the camel camp farm is down in Texas   Camp Verde , and that   s where they lived. When he got old enough and  wanted to go to college, they let him go, and they helped him and helped  buy his clothes and everything. He was the president of a youth group in  that whole district, and they had asked him to be head of it. I was a new  girl coming in to town in Saint Jo, so he went by to meet me, and that  was the fatal flash. He was lost. He was in love. (Laughter)  He was living in Bristow, but he was driving to Stillwater every  weekend so he could see me. So we just got married, and we had the  12  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Foster  little neighbor preacher there in the community come down to  Grandma   s house and marry us. I would   ve felt just as well being  married by a Baptist, whatever preacher he was, after school than if I  would have gone to a house of religion and stood in front of the whole  audience and said    I do    there.  How did he ask you? Do you remember how he proposed?  He just began talking about when we got married.  He just assumed you were going to say yes. And you were living in  Stillwater?  No, I was living in Saint Jo, Texas.  No, you were living in Stillwater at that time.  Let   s see. I   d gone down there to work.  Did you live in Stillwater at some point?  Yeah, we lived in Stillwater at some point, yeah, because that was their  home base, in Stillwater.  Tell them where your house was. Tell them where your house was,  where I was born in Stillwater. You remember your little house?  My grandparents had built a home right there off of the main street, off  of Main Street, and as business grew   what was that big department  store there?  Katz.  That one. Several things had done real well, and so we decided we   d  furnish them some money. (Laughter) We   d give them some, buy some  things, and so we did. We   ve bought things and kept them, bought some  clothes. You know, you never go around a town like that without buying  clothes. Now any other question?  So you lived in Stillwater for a little while?  Yeah. My husband   s folks lived Bristow, so we   d go home there in the  summertime or on vacations and things, but we   d always go back. My  grandfather had been made the head of the Extension division there, so  he would give me a job out there so we could make a little money and  afford to stay. That   s the way we managed.  13  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  What kind of job?  Office job.  Well, did you attend Oklahoma A M  College ?  Yeah, I went to Oklahoma    wound up going to OSU an awful lot for  several years, off and on. Then by the time I got out, I went in full-time,  and he went in full-time in the bank, so we probably had a fairly decent  income. By that time I had three girls.  No.  One daughter and two sons?  No, I had three daughters.  No, you were one of three daughters, but I was your first daughter and  then     Oh, I   m getting my generations mixed. (Laughter)  That   s okay.  There were boys in this one. (Laughter) I never could get quite used to  having boys.  Did you teach school in Stillwater?  No, I never did teach school in Stillwater. I know the first two school  teachings I did was I   my  father  was a teacher at a country school,  across the Red River. No, it wasn   t the Red River, but you had to cross  some   what   s that creek called?  Mud Creek?  Mud Creek, we had to cross Mud Creek to get there. If we   d gone by  road, we   d have had to drive around for about twenty-five miles. This  way, we cut through and waded Mud Creek and got there in an hour,  hour and a half. He was teaching on that side of Mud Creek, anyway.  I   ll never forget the time how embarrassed I was   there was just two  classrooms, and I was in the older classroom where there were bigger  kids. He always took the little group for that particular lesson and had  them sit up on the counter up on the little platform with him, and he  14  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  questioned them. The rest of us were supposed to attend to business and  prepare our lesson and everything, but I didn   t. I was so curious. I  listened. I wanted to know what those older kids were learning. Were  you ever like that when you were little? You always wanted to know  what the older ones were doing, trying to sneak something over on you. I  was listening to it, and finally he asked a question. He probably had  twelve in that class that were just sitting around him up on his platform.  I put my hand up, and he thought I probably wanted to go to the  bathroom. He nodded, so I answered the question. Well, they all just  collapsed, they just    That was the youngest in that room. The other  room was little bitty kids from fifth, sixth grade on down. These were  the older kids, and here I butted in and answered a question. I got out of  line, but they thought it was so funny. I know Arthur was real proud of  me because I knew the question.  We had cake sales, and the boys all came and bought our pies or  whatever they were. It was fun because by riding horseback   and I had  a horse and buggy, the horse with the harness on, so I just crawled on  that horse and rode across the creek with the rest of them. No, life, you  get to thinking about life. Mine was real interesting in a lot of ways.  When we had cake sale or anything like that, we just rode across the  creek. We didn   t ride around, drive around, or ride around that long way  to get to the school ground. Did that answer your question?  It did. Did your horse have a name?  Well, I   ve forgotten that. It   s been a long time ago, honey. Wasn   t very  important, I guess, at that.  Well, did you learn how to sew your own clothes? Did your mother sew  or you sew?  My mother sewed beautifully. When she started me off that fall at this  little country school right across the way  Texas Women   s College ,  they had sent a catalogue about what we were supposed to have to go to  this girls    school down there, and she made it all. I had plenty of clothes.  Did she teach you?  Well, I was never very interested in learning. (Laughs) I observed how  she did and applied it later, but I don   t think that she ever did much  teaching.  Well, how did you get to college when you left home? Did they take you  in a car, or did you ride a train, or how did you get there?  15  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Bishop  Foster  Bishop  Foster  At this one I had to go down and stay a week at a time. Then they   d  come get me and bring me back on weekends.  How would they come, though, in a Model T or in a horse and wagon or  what?  No, it probably was a Model T.  Yeah, about that time. Do you remember getting your first car?  Gosh, no. I don   t know that I ever had one.  Or learning how to drive?  Well, my mother taught me to drive in self-defense so she could protect  her interest. I don   t actually remember except that I learned fast and  pretty well.  What about seeing the airplane for the first time?  Seeing it? Well, I   ve been seeing airplanes all the time.  But do you remember the first time you saw one?  No.  Well, in the home you grew up in, can you describe it, the house?  We wound up, after my husband   s four years in the war, down in San  Antonio. He was stationed there, and he knew so much more about the  military part than the commanding officer did that the commanding  officer wouldn   t let him go. He had to stay there and boss them. We  went to regular public school there, I did. I loved San Antonio. Have you  ever lived in San Antonio?  No.  Well, if you ever get a chance. Have you ever lived in San Antonio?  I   ve visited.  It   s what?  I   ve visited there a few times.  Yeah. It   s a lovely city, and it   s still old, and of course all the time I was  16  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  going to school   oh, my grandfather came down, checking something.  My grandfather had been appointed at the college to check things. I   ve  forgotten what it was he was checking for them. He came down to check  it and found out I wasn   t   Grandfather was horrified.    She isn   t in  school?    He didn   t realize I was getting as good an education just the  way I was, going and reading, and my parents would correct me and  help me.  He was so horrified that   my granddaddy said,    Teresa, send him down  there to her house. He   s offering to keep her this semester.    It was  hurting this man   s conscience. He believed in strong student and that  sort of thing, and here I was just messing around. He took me in for a  semester, and I read all the   well, there was two series of books. One  was, I can   t remember. You know there were good commercial books  there about a man being taken care of in a lighthouse and that sort of  thing, paperback books or fiction like that. Well, I had read all his  paperback books, and so by the time school was out I could just go home  and not have to go back. I   ll never forget Marianna. Have you all been to  Marianna?  No.  Well it   s a nice little town. Of course, it was littler still then because,  after all, that was forty-five years ago.  Oh, longer than that.  Longer than that, yeah.  You mentioned Teresa. Who was that?  Teresa? That   s my mother.  Your mother.  Her father was     W. D. Bentley.  Was the Bentley that had the  Extension  department...  Okay.     and had all the responsibility and everything.  So your mother   s name was Teresa. What was your father   s name?  17  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Diehl  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Wait a minute. I hadn   t thought about it. Arthur Morgan.  No, that   s your husband.  Well, he   s named for     No, your dad was Mr.  Senter  Camp.   Senter H.  Camp.  You   ll get it eventually, huh?  My daughter reminded me. Do you see my picture up on the wall? Do  you see all the children and people I have in my life now?  A lot to remember.  Yeah.  So Teresa and  Senter  are your parents, and Teresa   s father was W. D.  Bentley, and what was her mother   s name, your grandmother   s name?  Julia.  Julia?  Aunt Julia.  Is that correct?  Julia Bentley, uh-huh.  Okay.  And then my grandfather was  W. D.  W. D.  And then your husband was Arthur.  Arthur Morgan.  And your three children were     18  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Finchum  Diehl  Finchum  Bishop  Foster  Bishop  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Bishop  Foster  Bishop  Claire Edith and Stephen Henry and Julianna     No, that   s your sister.     and Rachel.  That   s your sisters. Those are your two sisters.  Julianna and Rachel were your sisters? So sons were Stephen     Stephen Henry and George Edward.  Stephen and George? We got it. (Laughter)  You must have had a good relationship with your sisters. Do you  remember anything about them?  Well, I was pretty big   I was three or four years older than each of the  girls, see, so that made them quite a bit younger, and I kind of had  bossing powers. (Laughter)  Do you have a fond memory of bossing them, or do you have a fond  memory of your sisters?  Yes, I loved my sisters. They were smart, and they pulled up to their line  of their duty to the family name, keeping their grades up and everything.  I didn   t have to tend to them. (Laughter)  Did you all three share the same room, bedroom?  Yeah, there were times when we had to, and life was like that. When we  moved back to Stillwater, we had lots more room. My grandfather was  something in Stillwater. What was he?  He was with the college.  He was with the college, yeah.  What about your teaching years? Can you tell us a little bit about being  a teacher? What it was like for you to be a teacher?  I loved it. Teaching was just right down my alley. I have a captive  audience. (Laughter)  And what grades did you teach?  19  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Bishop  Foster  Bishop  Foster  Bishop  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Well, high school. I never taught below high school.  Yeah, you did. You started in seventh grade, eighth grade...  Yeah, but I went on up by the time it        with your youngest son because I had you in the eighth grade. That  was the first year you taught.  First year I taught was the eighth grade, yeah. I knew I didn   t teach very  many years.  Do you have any fond memories of teaching, any stories that you  remember?  I loved teaching. I   d have taught for nothing. I was saying that to Arthur.     Arthur, this is the most fun I ever had. I would do it for nothing.    He   d  say,    Hush, the school board will hear you.    (Laughter)  Where did you teach primarily, what town? In Bristow?  Mm-hmm.  Do you have any favorite students?  Oh, I had   they   re all my favorite students. I love them. I   ve still got  them. I   m still teaching them. They come in, and I correct their  grammar. (Laughter)  You ain   t got no     I   ve broken them of a lot of habits, I   ll tell you.  The atters group.  Huh?  You had your atters group.  Oh, yeah, I had the atters list. The family had a whole bunch of     Where   s it at? Where   s it at?    Oh, I just can   t stand that  I had an atters  list, and if they said that, I drew a diagram of it at the board, what  happened, in black and white chalk. They all got to know what the atters  list was. (Laughter)  20  Finchum  Bishop  Foster  Bishop  Diehl  Foster  Bishop  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Bishop  Foster  Diehl  Foster  You don   t end the sentence with    at,    right?  Uh-huh.     Where are you at?    I   d make a diagram and show it, and it makes a big  impression on kids when the teacher has a fit over something. They  think,    Gosh, this is awful.     And then you correct yourself.  You   d teach them how to answer the phone, how to answer it correctly.  Oh,    This is he    or    This is she.    Yeah, they never did think that  sounded right, but I insisted on it. You know, it   s amazing what you can  insist on when you   re teaching a bunch of kids. I loved it. That   s the  only reason I like it out here, because I   ve just got a fresh crop of  students. See how that light   s up there over my bed, and we got the  curtains washed.  Did you ever have any, what we would call, problem children in school?  Did you have to deal with any students you had to correct or discipline?  Well, I tried to help them out. I handled that by calling them out for  personal surveys and talking what they did and showing what they were  doing wrong. I found that kids were pretty reasonable, pretty reasonable  around about everything. See, I loved that window. Who picked my  room?  George, George picked it.  My oldest son picked this room for me, and I   ve been so happy with it.  I   ve got a separate bathroom there, and I have a nice big closet here, in  here.  Now here in the facility, do you ever see any former students?  Yeah, I   ve been in here in my bed. I stay on the bed pretty much looking  out the window. I heard some men coming down the hall. They said,     Gosh, is that old girl still alive? I thought she was dead a long time  ago.    I heard them good and loud. The passageway through here   this  is when they saw my name on the door. Claire, show them my name.  They know, they saw.  Well no. Open the door and let them see.  21  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Bishop  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  That   s okay. We saw it when we came in.  Oh, did you?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, well, okay.  Did they come on in and see you?  Yeah.  Did you still have to correct their English?  Yeah, I had to educate them. By that time, I had the reputation for  correcting, and I don   t hesitate to correct anybody.  You want to tell them about the only paddling you ever gave?  What?  Do you want to tell them about the only time you paddled somebody at  school? You remember the last     It   s been a long time since I paddled. Tell me. Remind me when I  paddled somebody.  Well, it was after you had retired, and they had you come in and take  care of the library.  Oh, I was punishing them for...  Well, this one boy kept coming in and running around in the library, and  you took him down to the principal.  I don   t remember that.  Well, good. (Laughter) That was the only time I ever heard of her losing  her cool.  I have always loved teaching and working with them. Kids nowadays,  they   re pretty receptive. They really are. They believe you when you say  that God will get them if they don   t watch out, if they don   t do what   s  right. How about that little picture, Claire, can you show them?  The one with George?  22  Finchum  Bishop  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Diehl  Finchum  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Bishop  Finchum  Foster  Yeah, that   s nice, too.  Were you president of the school board in Bristow, president of the  school board or on the school board?  What   s amazing was is that Arthur and I were both     Well, after you retired you ran for the school board, didn   t you? You  were on the school board for twelve years, and part of that time you  were the head.  Arthur was Central Vo-Tech School Board president at  the same time.   And part of the time he was on there, too.  He was on the  Central  Vo-Tech School Board at the same time  Education has always been very important?  Very, most important thing on Earth. You can teach anything with  education, how to behave and   . I lie there and look out that window,  and the boy picked that for me. Oh, there went somebody. See, there  goes somebody out there right now. The passersby are people who  wouldn   t even know I was out here, didn   t know I was alive. I   ve heard  them come by and say,    Is that old girl still alive?    to whoever the  people they   re visiting with.  Do you remember when you retired, what year it was, how long ago?  Sixty-five.   Nineteen  sixty-five, or when she was sixty-five?  Yeah, I think that.  We could look it up.  Early in the   70s then.  In 1977 or 1978.  Nineteen seventy-something. That   s okay.  See, we   ve got this thoroughfare that goes a ways. I   m not sure how long  this highway is, but I swear it   s a mile long.  23  Diehl  Foster  Bishop  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  Finchum  Foster  Diehl  Foster  Diehl  You mean your hallway? It is a mile.  Yeah, because in the first place, we   re the second door up, up from the  door there. It opens on to the end of Main Street.  Did you ever think you   d make it to a hundred?  You know, I didn   t stop to think about it. I just figured God would take  care of me.  Did either of your sisters make it to a hundred?  You know, I   ve lost track.  They   ve both been dead for quite a while. Aunt Julia was getting close  to a hundred, but she was in her nineties.  Yeah, and none of the family ever made it.
