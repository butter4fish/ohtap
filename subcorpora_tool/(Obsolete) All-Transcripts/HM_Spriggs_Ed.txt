Speaker 2: My father's name was Shivers, S-H-I-V-E-R-S, Shalitiel, S-H-A- (laughter), Shalitiel, Spriggs, S-P-R-I-G-G-S [Shivers Spriggs].

Speaker 2: S-H-A-L-I-T-I-E-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Waco, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: My father died when I was thirteen years old and between the time of my birth and his death, he was, he was a minister actually, and we moved a lot.  There was never really much you know the father/son relationship in those years because he was often traveling.  So was there, there--I have no stories of his youth, no stories of his growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay did you know his parents?
Speaker 2: No I did not.  They were long ceased, they were deceased.
Speaker 1: Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm named after my grandfather [Edward Spriggs (ph.)] on the Edward part.  The Sim part is from my mother's father [Sim Jones], and yeah so I'm named after both grandfathers, maternal and paternal.
Story_ID: 623441
Speaker 1: Tell me your mother's name and when and where she was born.
Speaker 2: She was--my mother's name is Julia Mae, M-A-E, Jones Spriggs [Julia Jones Spriggs].  She was born in Dawson, Georgia, 1907.  She died in San Francisco [California] in March, 1999.
Speaker 1: And did your mother share any stories with you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, I asked her once about how she managed to get out of Georgia.  And she said because her father drove a, what they call a drayage [sic. dray], he drove mule wagons and horse wagons and carried goods back and forth from the railroad train to wherever it was to be delivered.  And so he had that kind of transportation, and that's how they got out of, they left Georgia because she insisted that he take her out.  My grandfather, her father, had I don't know how many wives.  But the person I know as my grandmother was not her mother, that was her stepmother.  So I never knew her mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Sim Jones.
Speaker 1: And do you know he was born in Dawson as well, or do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, but it's possible.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then the grandmother that you knew, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Lula [Lula Jones (ph.)].
Speaker 1: And what did you know about her?
Speaker 2: We went to live with her when we were living in Dover, I'm sorry when we, we left Texas and went to New Jersey.  She was living in New Jersey, she had a house in New Jersey and that's where I met her, but she died there.  And she was the first person that I became aware of as a dead person because in those days, the body was in a casket in the house.  So I had an opportunity to see her close up and you know as a, as a deceased person.  But what I remember of her was that she was small and she was a very sweet person.  But I also have one life scar from her.  She was ironing, one of those heavy irons and I had to reach across the ironing board after being admonished for doing so many times, and she accidentally burned me on, on my wrist and I still have the mark.  So I can remember my grandmother very well (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now your grandfather, did, did they own a farm or did they live in the city?
Speaker 2: He didn't own land.  If he did, I, no he didn't own land in Dawson.  They lived in Dawson and then they moved to, I don't exactly know where they moved, whether they moved to Philadelphia or New Jersey, but they ultimately, he worked for DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company] and disa- vaguely remember some parts of, of a story that he died from some sort of chemical exposure.
Speaker 1: Do you know about, about his education or your grandmother's education?
Speaker 2: Neither.  I don't think either of them had that much, but he was a minister.  So he had some intelligence but, in terms of reading and all of that, but I don't know his educational level.
Speaker 1: What about your mother, what about her education?
Speaker 2: She was educated in Dawson and then in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where after high school she became a grammar school teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there a story about how your mother and father met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't have that.  My sister's [Jacguelyn Spriggs] the one that keeps all that in her head (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest of three children by that union--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Reverend Spriggs [Shivers Spriggs] and Julia Jones.
Story_ID: 623442
Speaker 1: All right tell me about your, your siblings, tell me--
Speaker 2: Reverend Spriggs [Shivers Spriggs] had a prior marriage.  His first wife died of child, at childbirth.  But they had two children, Junior, someone else named Shivers [Shivers Spriggs], who is deceased now, but he later became a teacher.  And his sister, Geraldine [Geraldine Spriggs].  Geraldine had some sort of retarda- retardation, I don't know exactly what it was, but she had to be, she had to be placed in a, in a home of some kind, a facility of some kind.  So we never got to really know her that well.  But Junior was like the big, big brother.  But also there's another brother who, of my father and mother's [Julia Jones Spriggs] union.  So that's Mordecai [Mordecai Spriggs] and then the sister and then me, I'm the baby of the three.
Speaker 1: Okay, Mordecai--
Speaker 2: M-O-R-D-E-C-A-I.
Speaker 1: --and then your sister's name is?
Speaker 2: Jacguelyn, Jacguelyn, L-Y-N [Jacguelyn Spriggs].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when your mother and father marry and begin to have children, where are they living?
Speaker 2: Well, they're living in New Jersey, they're living in Penns Grove because they had to go to Pleasantville to the hospital.  And they had, for both of those, my sister was born in Atlantic City [New Jersey] and my brother I think was born in Pleasantville, in Jersey [New Jersey].
Story_ID: 623443
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood, well let me, before I ask you that, do you know anything else about your parents, maybe their siblings or--
Speaker 2: Well, certainly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mentioned that my [maternal] grandfather had multiple marriages.
Speaker 1: Right and this is Grandfather Jones [Sim Jones].
Speaker 2: Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Grandfather Jones, one set of children also ended up in New Jersey, I don't know whether they were already, I assumed they were already there when my mother [Julia Jones Spriggs] and them landed in New Jersey, this is southern Jersey, southern New Jersey.  And so she had a half sister, Mary Green [ph.] who had several children.  So these were my cousins that we kind of grew up together with when we went to New Jersey.  My brother, oldest brother, lived somewhere else during those early part of their marriage.  I don't know where he lived, but they ultimately moved to Dover, Delaware.  He got a church [Shiloh Baptist Church (ph.)] in Dover, Delaware, my father [Shivers Spriggs] did.  And we all were there together, Geraldine [Geraldine Spriggs], Junior [Shivers Spriggs], Mordecai [Mordecai Spriggs], Jackie [Jacguelyn Spriggs], myself, my mother and my father and a dog.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you moved to Delaware?
Speaker 2: Prior to the first grade, so I would say, I would say four and a half to five.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay now, okay so you, that's your, your siblings.  So is that as far back as you can go, is your Grandfather Jones, or do you--
Speaker 1: On my mother's side (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On your mother's side.
Speaker 1: Yes it is.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: I mean you know I met her, I met my mother's stepsisters but we could, who, you know Mary and Aunt--
Speaker 2: It was Mary Green, right, that was one sister.
Speaker 1: Yes. I'm blanking on (unclear).
Speaker 2: If it comes to you--
Speaker 1: Because she died when I was very young.  But out of Dawson [Georgia], I guess that's where her roots are and that's where most of my relatives came from, up into New Jersey.  But on my brother, on the Spriggs side, there were, somehow, it might have been my, my stepbrother's mother's side, I don't know.  But there's some relatives that were in Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh type area.  And, and the oldest brother ultimately settled in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  But he was the one that was more like a brother, big brother to me, teaching me different survival techniques in terms of street deals.
Speaker 2: And that, that's the one, that's Junior that you're talking about?
Speaker 1: That's Junior, that's Shivers.
Speaker 2: Shivers, okay.  So he actually lived near where you lived when you were coming up.
Speaker 1: He lived with us.
Speaker 2: He lived with you.
Speaker 1: You know when we moved to Dover and then he went to college there, but he went to the [U.S.] Army first, then he came back and went to college at Dover, Delaware State [Delaware State College; Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware] rather.  So he lived with us until we left Dover.  We left Dover in 1947 after my father had settled in San Francisco [California] and decided we needed to be together.  So we all took a train, that is, me and my brother and sister, and went to Dover.  By then Junior was getting married, so he was in, he moved to Philadelphia; started a family.
Speaker 2: So you took a train from--
Speaker 1: San Francisco, I mean from Dover, Delaware.
Speaker 2: --Dover, Delaware to San Francisco.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 623444
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the time that you're living in Dover [Delaware] this is kind of when your--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --when you're staying in Dover from, like '38 [1938] or so, 1938?  Well you said you were four?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Four or five?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay so from 1938 to 1947, that's nine years.  Let's talk about where you lived as a, as a young child.  Do you, can you tell me what your earliest childhood memory is?
Speaker 2: Well I guess one of my earliest memories is riding a dog's back in the dining room and him, the dog going under the table and me getting knocked out by hitting the edge of the table, right in the forehead.  So that memory is always there (laughter).
Story_ID: 623445
Speaker 1: Now if you were to think about the area where you lived, did y'all live in a house, in a rural or a city?
Speaker 2: In Dover [Delaware]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Dover was a little, little, it's the capital of Delaware, but it's a little joint.  So you might call it a town then, but it's a city now I believe, which blossomed after, after, well in the, in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] after integration and all of that.  But we went to, you know it was a segregated school, segregated town.  The part of town that we lived in was near the railroad of course.  And we had a school that went from, from first to the tenth grade and if you finished the tenth grade there and you go into the eleventh grade, you would go out to Delaware State [Delaware State College; Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware].  Now I mentioned that it was a, you know, a segregated school and segregated town, so we got all the hand me down stuff from the other side of town, in terms of schoolbooks and whatever.  But we had a very strong tradition of education in that school.  And the teachers all lived in the community, so I knew my first grade teacher, third grade teacher and second grade teacher, my fifth grade teacher, like that, and they all knew my mother [Julia Jones Spriggs] 'cause my mother was also involved in, in running a kindergarten in the basement of my father's church [Shiloh Baptist Church (ph.)].  So everybody kind of knew our family.  So that it was, it was like a, a school that, where you, you had to achieve because the teachers were not going to let you slack off.  And I got a great foundation from that.  The reason I say it was great is because we left when I was in the seventh grade, in the middle of my seventh grade in November for that trip to San Francisco [California] and landed in the seventh grade there.  And I was ahead of everybody, okay, to the point where it was boring.  So, so I knew had, my grounding was great in math, you know, English and all of that.
Speaker 1: And you were a good student.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the neighborhood and the people who lived in the neighborhood, you said, you said that--
Speaker 2: In Dover?
Speaker 1: --yes, that your teachers lived in the neighborhood.  Who else lived--
Speaker 2: Well we had--
Speaker 1: --in your community?
Speaker 2: --we had, we had, undertaker parlor on either, either direction you went from my house on the next corner.  And a barbershop a half a block away, a grocery store a man ran in his house across the street, a few doors down.  It was a semi-rural situation because people had gardens.  Some people had farms, or pieces of land that they developed, you know out, just outside of the town.  And so you know I've learned to do all the things a kid does, learns in a small town from slopping hogs to, to raising rabbits, to killing rabbits, to, you know to cutting them up for meat (unclear), or to picking beans or planting potatoes, all those things I had done by the time I went to San Francisco in the seventh grade.  In fact, yeah I, I did mostly, I loved animals, so I was always caring for somebody's cow or their, especially if they'll let me ride their horse.  So it was a small town, but it was like, you know, just then on the edge of the country.
Speaker 1: Who, who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Across the street, the Carters, Benny Carter [ph.], we called him Chicken, Biddy when he was younger and then Chicken when he got older, he was a friend.  Addison [ph.] too up the street, we played football together, we did that a lot and he had, his uncles had pigs and rabbits.  With him I did a lot of that.  So we were tight.  And you know it was several others, Bubba (laughter), Rabbit.
Speaker 1: Now, in, at your school, were there activities that you participated in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhat in the band.  My brother had gotten a trumpet one Christmas and he was in the band and then when it came time for me to join the band, the principal who was the band leader, he wanted me to bring my brother's trumpet. That was my brother's trumpet, you know, so I didn't stay in the band long. So I ended up playing the flute or something.  But yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said you used to like to play football?
Speaker 2: Yeah, football, all the sports, we did all except basketball and that's because we didn't have, we didn't have a playground.  We actually cleared a lot, the community got together and cleared a lot and created a baseball field, softball field.  And, but I didn't see a basketball until I got to San Francisco and at the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)] which was around the corner from my house, and a hoop? No.  But baseball, we knew baseball and we swam in the lake, the whole shebang for country people.
Story_ID: 623446
Speaker 1: To take you back to that time, think about a sound, a sight or a smell that takes you, that makes you remember that time [in Dover, Delaware].  What would, what would you say?
Speaker 2: Smelling blackberries, or mulberries even, coming home from school.  Sound would be the trickling of water in the brook that we had to cross, that ran under the road that we, which was a paved road which we had to take and we, you know, fished for tadpoles in there and stuff like that, crayfish.  So that sound, you know, the brook sound of fresh water, cold, clear water.
Speaker 1: What about smell, you said mulberries. A sight.
Speaker 2: Sight, well a sight would be when the water tank of the, which was a block away from my house overflowed, and it froze.  So all the cascading water was frozen in place and we were able to, you know, to do our ice skate-less ice skating on the, on the, or sledding around it.  So that, that sight was, you know, to see a frozen water cas- that had cascaded down and frozen in place was amazing.
Story_ID: 623447
Speaker 1: Now I want you to give me more of a description.  Say if you had to take me on a, a tour of, from your house to, say to your school.  Who lives in the neighborhood, what, what occupations do some of your friends' parents have and who owns the, the stores?  You, you told me about a store and a funeral parlor.  Who owns these businesses?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Are they black folks or white folks that own them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, this was the black section of town [Dover, Delaware].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The next block going away from the direction you'd go from my school would be, be in the white part of town.  Because that section was kind of a small sliver, but it was by the railroad track and there were teachers, there were as I mentioned ministers, there were people who had, we considered rich (laughter).  I know what that means now but so their houses were kind of elaborate.  There was a, well of course we had a strip where the little nightclubs were, juke joints were, so the guy who owned that, he rode motorcycles, Saul Paskins [ph.].  He lived around the opposite corner from where I'd go from, from school.  And his shops were around there.  We weren't far from the railroad track as I mentioned, so where you had to go to get your coal or your ice.  And the people who worked in those places all lived around, around there so besides teachers, you had people who were gardeners, people who worked in other people's houses, people who worked with some of the downtown grocery stores like the A and P [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company] or Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.].  And some people just worked, you know were some form of agrar- agrarian industry, picking apples, picking tomatoes, picking cherries, picking whatever could be picked, people did it.
Story_ID: 623448
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was about to mention, the churches that were in the neighborhood [in Dover, Delaware], Baptist church, Pentecostal church, Methodist church, a couple of Methodist churches.  So we had every denomination except Catholic.  I don't know where any, it wasn't in that section of town if there was one that black people went to.  I didn't never know a Catholic, a black Catholic until I went to San Francisco [California].  But the, so since my father [Shivers Spriggs] was a minister, I spent a lot of time in his church [Shiloh Baptist Church (ph.)].  We all did.  But we also went to other churches, interesting enough, especially when my father had left town, left for months sometimes.  He went to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], he went to Harrisburg [Pennsylvania], he went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Chicago [Illinois].  And like I say he finally ended up in California, but during those times we weren't really tied to go to that church anymore.  So we would go to, and we loved going to some of the other churches.  Pentecostal church we'd sit outside of that just to hear the, you know the shouting and stuff.  But the Methodist church we kind of related to because a lot of our friends went to the Methodist church.  And so we also did the summer bible study thing there.  We always (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the, at the Methodist church?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 623449
Speaker 1: But between these churches, there was a place, a little building that, that I mentioned Dover [Delaware] as the chicken capital, I think roosters is the symbol for, for that state.  Any case, there's a place we called the gizzard house, can you imagine?  So what would happen in the gizzard house, all these gizzards would, would come from the chicken factory 'cause nobody was eating gizzards.  But in our section of town, these ladies would get these gizzards and they would clean them there.  Now I don't know what the, how they, they, you know we didn't particularly eat gizzards in terms of as a, as a thing.  If we had a, if my mother [Julia Jones Spriggs] had a whole turkey, whole chicken, we might have that gizzard in a, 'cause she could make gravy and stuff.  But there was people bought these gizzards, gizzards and rice, gizzards and potatoes, I don't know.  But there was a little factory there (laughter), which stays in my memory as well as the smell, okay.  So that was a little story I was going to tell you just about that, but that's, that's, that's just one of those images that crop up every now and then for me.
Story_ID: 623450
Speaker 1: You talked about going to get coal and ice.  Was that one of your chores?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  To get coal we would have to walk a couple of blocks because the part of the railroad where the coal was dumped and where the coal, whatever that, can't even remember what they called it now, but where you got your coal and your ice was a couple blocks away.  So yeah we would get that there.  If we didn't get it delivered by a big-- a lot of it, then I'd have to take a, a bucket and carry that coal.  But in the house once it was delivered, we had a stove to heat the house and we had the cooking stove.  Both of them were coal and, and wood burning.  So for coal, you'd have to clean that stove out because of the ashes so you can restock it with coal.  But your coal couldn't, your supply of coal was usually in a shed a few, you know, paces from the house.  So you had to carry that, I don't care what the weather was like, you had to get that coal and bring it into the house and you had to feed the stove with it.  Likewise with that ice if you didn't have ice for the refrigerator, you had to go, for the icebox, you had to go and get that ice or it was, you had it delivered.  Most of the time it was delivered.  When we missed the delivery, we had to go and get it.  My mother [Julia Jones Spriggs] during World War II [WWII], worked out of town in Elkton, Maryland, the ammunitions plant [Triumph Explosives, Inc.].  So she was on a bus in the morning, sometime not coming back for maybe eighteen hours or whatever.  And so often we had to make sure all that stuff was in order when she got there (laughter).  When she got back home.  But--
Speaker 1: Would your father [Shivers Spriggs] be gone and she be gone at the same time?  Would you have taken care of yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we, well remember I had, I was the youngest I had--
Speaker 1: Your older brother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) a sister [Jacguelyn Spriggs] and brother [Mordecai Spriggs]. Yeah, two years apart, all of us.  So my brother was four years older than me and my sister two years older than me.  But the one who was in the [U.S. military] service, he was a man, man.  So when he [Shivers Spriggs] was there, you know--
Speaker 1: Did your mother ev--
Speaker 2: --we all had things to do.  We all had everything laid out for us to do and we did it.
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever talk about her, her work at the ammunitions plant?
Speaker 2: Actually I never really got much information on that except she was an inspector.  After whatever was done she had to inspect it.  Make sure it was correct or whatever.  But no, we never really had much conversation about what actually went on there.
Story_ID: 623451
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you can remember about Dover, Delaware?
Speaker 2: I can remember a lot about Dover but you know this is the city, this, the town where I learned to fish.  I mentioned you know dealing with some animals and taking care of rabbits and helping to raise rabbits and helping to market rabbits.  Planting, you know, picking tomatoes, slopping hogs, so I had a full life before I (laughter) got to the seventh grade in San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: And all these things that, that you did, they were usually at somebody else's, somebody else had a farm or--
Speaker 2: These were not our animals, no you're right, exactly.  I was either, either I was making you know a few pennies, nickels and dimes, whatever was paid, or I was helping, helping my buddy.  And that's how we spent our time.  But at the same time, I got a job at the chicken, what we called the chicken factory.  This is a place that, where they bring the chickens in from whoever was growing them and they got them ready for, for market, for packing and stuff.  So I did some chicken plucking.
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: That was really nasty (laughter).  That was so nasty.  You know they, they would steam the, they'd run these guys through hot water and steam and stuff and then you had to, they was moving on a conveyor belt.  And you had to do your work real fast so certain parts of that, that bird, different people were dealing with.  So--
Speaker 1: How old were you when you had that job?
Speaker 2: Well I left Dover at, I left Dover, had my thirteenth birthday in San Francisco, so I was ten and eleven.  But that was only one job.  I had, I worked at the bowling alley, industrious family, we did (laughter), worked at the bowling alley setting pins and I was really proud of that because I was, my, my little income was able to provide the lunch money for all of us (laughter).  But I wasn't the only one working.  My brother [Mordecai Spriggs] worked at the Dover Tea House [Dover, Delaware] as some kind of a helper in the, in the, it was a famous pastry place, famous you know sort of a cafe side of a, a hotel.  It's called Dover Tea House.
Speaker 1: Gover?
Speaker 2: Dover.
Speaker 1: Dover Tea House.
Speaker 2: Dover Tea House.  And my mother [Julia Jones Spriggs] had also worked there as a pastry cook after the war [World War II, WWII].  She also worked as a seamstress after the war and she also took in sewing.  She was good enough to do, she could make a man's suit, a woman's suit, she could repair any garment and she could do it at home.  She had customers coming and going (laughter) for you know, hemming pants and all that kind of stuff, taking pants in, taking the waist in, altering, whatever.  She could do all of that.  So she did at that home as a freelance, but she also did it at a, at a cleaning shop, I think it was a cleaners, yeah a cleaning shop for quite a spell.  So between that and the Dover Tea House, that was the work that she did before we left Delaware.
Story_ID: 623452
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church that your father [Shivers Spriggs] had there in Dover [Delaware], do you remember?
Speaker 2: Shiloh Baptist Church [ph.].
Speaker 1: And, and how long did your mother [Julia Jones Spriggs] run the nursery (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On, on Fulton Street.
Speaker 1: On Fulton Street?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how long did your mother, you said that she ran, was, was that the--
Speaker 2: I couldn't tell you that, how long.  I know that, no I can't tell you how long.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She actually, she and another lady actually, I know it started while my father had the church, but it, it went beyond that.  She and another lady ran it.  They were friends for a long time.
Story_ID: 623453
Speaker 1: So now your father [Shivers Spriggs] announces that he wants y'all to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --move out to San Francisco [California].  But tell me about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, disrupted everything (laughter).  You know I'm in the seventh grade, you know.  Everything is rosy, you know.  My brother's [Mordecai Spriggs] in the, he's about to, he's about to go to Delaware State [Delaware State College; Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware] in the eleventh grade, everything is rosy.  My sister [Jacguelyn Spriggs] is in the middle of that.  We were happy in terms of you know, what we knew as our, you know, our lifestyle and everything and we didn't know anything about being poor or we were kind of immune from any of the real southern stuff that people were, that my mother [Julia Jones Spriggs] had experienced and my father.  Because of the cocoon we were in, we were in a small town, in a small section of that town and we had the school, we had our, everything, all our institutions were there.  So we didn't have to interact in a way that you know, was negative with anything.  Except an occasional fight with a white boy or something.  I mean that's normal.
Speaker 1: What about listening to the radio?  Did you listen to the radio and hear any of what was going on in the world?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely, yeah.  Not only listened to the radio, but we had newspapers, Afro American newspapers.  So we were aware of you know, the racial situation.  We were aware of, a lot about the war [World War II, WWII] of course on the radio.  Walter, we listened to Walter Winchell religiously and some religious singing programs I guess.  But, and then some, you know, soap opera stuff on the radio.  We didn't have TV until, yeah just that last year we were there we got a little TV.  I should say that that house that we lived in after we moved from the parish house to another house which was two blocks away, had no electricity.  That's where the ice and the, and the stuff comes in 'cause the other house had electricity.  So we were studying by kerosene lamp, yes.  I'm in the seventh grade, sixth grade, fifth grade, fourth grade, studying by kerosene lamp.  You know we had the heat, you know, the coal and whatever to heat the house.
Speaker 1: Was there running water?
Speaker 2: No.  Two doors down, so bucket, buckets of water were brought to the house by us out of a pump, you know.  So, good question.
Speaker 1: So how do you hear that the family's going to move?
Speaker 2: Well now you know my father came and--
Speaker 1: Back and forth.
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean it wasn't no, this huge spaces, but he did come home you know and there were discussions and stuff because my mother was putting pressure on him, I know that, 'cause they was fussing.  So he, you know and they were in correspondence and stuff and there were letters.  And so of course we got the mail before she did, but we didn't open but we knew when Daddy wrote, and so she had to tell us something and you have, letters got there, right.  So she told us that, that he wanted us to move, to come to San Francisco and as soon as we sent the money, we'd be there, we would be going.  And a date was set and all that.  So it's, you know we were all saddened by it and everything but hey, do what you got to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me about the ride out there.
Speaker 2: Yeah we had a stopover in Chicago [Illinois] where we met a lot of his, my father's family, the Baileys [ph.].  We didn't know them but we met, we spent, I think we did over, yeah we did overnight there.
Speaker 1: How did you travel?
Speaker 2: Train, yeah train.  Not Pullman porter, sitting up in that train (laughter).  And I don't remember the meals, but most of it was, you know, sandwiches and whatever.  And it was three days, something like three days, three nights, something like that, it was long for, for me, but we made it.  And I have, the only memory I have of it is trying to situate myself to sleep, you know.  So I remember one of the seats that I had, a lady shared that seat with me and I don't know whether she got on at Denver [Colorado], I don't know where she got on.  But I, I was so tired.  She said, "You can lay on, lay across my lap if you want to," and I did, I (laughter).  But that was really like oh, my god, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 623454
Speaker 1: How was it when you got to San Francisco [California]? Where did you all live?
Speaker 2: My father [Shivers Spriggs] had acquired a considerable amount of property, yeah.  He had acquired what would amount to, well it had, okay here's what happened.  San Francisco got rid of all the Japanese during World War II [WWII].  And when they came back, when they came back he was already a landlord.  So he was renting to a shoe shop family, there was a, there was a storefront that was a church on that property, which was his.  Then there was another storefront which was a church on that property, which separated the two by an alley, which had a flat upstairs, rent income property, then there was a house in the back, two story, two different units.  Then the property between his church and the shoe shop had, was separated by some wide steps in the front, okay.  When you got to the top, there was two floors, two different flats on each side.  So that was his property.  So if we counted it, from my count, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight units of property, or eight sources of income.  Well we got there in November of 1947 and he died March 1948.  So we were just getting there and just settling in and he ups and dies.
Speaker 1: Do you know how he acquired the, the property?
Speaker 2: I don't know the specifics, but it was purchased, you know I remember, I know he got it from, it had been owned by one person, a husband and wife, he got it from them.  And yeah, they had gotten, they were old and they didn't, I guess the whole, there also, San Francisco you might need to know, was a lot of people from the South went west to work for the [U.S.] Navy or the [U.S.] Army or whatever during the war.  So they settled in the area called the Fillmore District [San Francisco, California], or one of the areas they settled in was the Fillmore District.  That's where we lived.  And if you were a jazz person you would, knew something about jazz history, you would have heard of Bop City [Jimbo's Bop City, San Francisco, California].  Our place was around the corner from Bop City, on a main street where the, where the trolley ran from way downtown to way out to the beach.  That was Geary Street [sic. Geary Boulevard].  So it wasn't the most desirable street to live on because you had the traffic of the trolleys and it was a main street.  It's still like that, but it's not, I mean it's been redone and all that.  So it was also dirty.  The trolleys create a lot of dirt in the air and it settled on the street, on cars and stuff.  So in that way it was uncomfortable, but it was the Fillmore District.  And the Fillmore District was, was a black area and in then the Orientals [East Asian] came back in, the Japanese came back in, so it was still all minorities and there was a lot of Filipino, a lot of Chinese.  And I grew up with all this, all these people, multicultural setting.  And so in, during those days we all kind of, we all went to the same schools, you know it was no separation.  So that was totally new for me.  We had, we had Chinese restaurants, about two, let me see, one, two, three, within the block that I lived in.  It was a long block.  And we had Chinese laundry, I mentioned the Japanese shoe shop and we had a Filipino grocery store directly across the street from our house.  So it was like a, it was a minority ghetto. Okay.  Well there was a transition of people who had acquired that property when the Japanese were relocated and then they was, they were, they were, I don't want to call them slumlords necessarily, but they were, they were landlords in the slum area.  Some of them were selling out.  So I, I know (cough) that it was kind of cheap (cough), that he got the property.
Story_ID: 623455
Speaker 1: So what happened after your father [Shivers Spriggs] passed away? How did he die?
Speaker 2: He had a stroke of some kind (cough).  Died in the hospital.  And he was overweight, high blood pressure and the rest of it, you know, ate a lot of pork.
Speaker 1: Okay so what happened after he passed away?  Did your mother [Julia Jones Spriggs], was she able to keep the properties?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, we stayed there.  She, she maintained it, she was the landlord, she was the owner, she paid it off, whatever the deal was got paid off.  And then renovation, not renovation, urban renewal came along and so she ended up selling to them.  Bought herself a, a house.  You'd have to know San Francisco [California], but it was a well located house, but still about, outside of, it's hard to explain.  But do you know San Francisco at all?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You heard of Haight Ashbury [San Francisco, California], though, where the hippies were.  Okay she bought a four, one, two, four unit building there.  We called them flats, there right off of Haight Street on Clayton [Street] which is like a block or two from Haight, so called Haight Ashbury which is just an intersection.  But that whole place was kind of, what's here? We have Five Points [Little Five Points, Atlanta, Georgia], but it's much bigger than that.  So but that's the lifestyle of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When she bought it wasn't quite that, it was just the flower children thing was just like creeping in.
Speaker 1: So what year are we in now, 19--you left [Dover, Delaware], you got there in 1947.
Speaker 2: Forty-seven [1947], um-hm.
Speaker 1: And your father died early in, in '48 [1948]
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how long did you live in that area before your mother boug- moved?
Speaker 2: Well I left before she did because I got married.
Speaker 1: Well, we haven't, you were in the seventh grade (laughter). You couldn't have got married.
Speaker 2: Well we lived there until I was out of high school [George Washington Senior High School; George Washington High School, San Francisco, California] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I went a couple of years to college (laughter).
Story_ID: 623456
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So let's go on to school.  You said that the, all of the, the diverse population.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All went to school together.  What was the name of your, did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: We had options, though, we had options.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah I went to John Swett Junior High School [San Francisco, California] at first.
Speaker 1: What is the name of it?  John?
Speaker 2: John Swett.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Junior high, then I went to Marina Junior High [Marina Junior High School; Marina Middle School, San Francisco, California] because they changed John Swett over to an elementary school from a junior high.  And then I went to George Washington High School [George Washington Senior High School; George Washington High School, San Francisco, California].  Same school that Johnny Mathis went to.  Now I'm talking huh? (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Johnny Mathis was a year behind me.
Speaker 1: So, so tell me about your activities when you get to San Francisco [California].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you never mention anything about art when you were in Delaware.
Speaker 2: Well there wasn't anything to mention except that I was always doing art and my first real fight you might say, was because a neighbor and her daughter was visiting my mother [Julia Jones Spriggs] and they were in the kitchen cooking or whatever, my mother loves and the neighbor was, you know, this is a neighbor, they're in the kitchen too.  And I'm on the floor drawing with my crayons and whatever, whatever.  And this little girl messed up my drawing.  That was a no-no.  I lit into her, so that was my first, remembered fight with somebody.  But now flash forward to San Francisco in John Swett Junior High School my second day there, the class that I was enrolled in was a, was my homeroom, was an art class.  So all the supplies for art and all that was there.  And I was in the closet with the teacher getting some kind of art supplies, now this is like my second day there.  I came back to my seat and somebody had messed up my drawing (laughter), purposely of course.  And nobody would tell me who it was and then you know kind of the eyes told me who did it, you know.  Turns out it was this Filipino kid and so I encountered him and told him look, you know, whatever I said.  And, and I don't know if I shoved him or something but you know, we couldn't fight in the class but he said, "Well I'll meet you at the park."  There was a park we had to go through to get home, which is somewhere where everybody did their fighting (laughter) after school.  So we met at the park and I dusted him so bad that we became best friends for life.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Leo Valledor, Leo Valledor was also into arts strongly and played a big role in helping me get into art school in that, in that he turned me on to, to the art school [California School of Fine Arts; San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco, California] that he was getting ready to go to and I didn't know anything about it because I hadn't been preparing that way at high school, but he went to a different high school and they had more involvement with, with trying to get people into careers than the one that I was, 'cause my counselor wasn't, wasn't into whatever she should have been into for us.  So but I was always doing art and I was art in the high school.  They were getting me to do all of the stuff for the plays and the this and that and the other.  Even you know for illustrating different things for teachers.  But you know I didn't have any guidance as so far as how to utilize that in life at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Leo Valledor, this boy that I beat up the first couple of days, we were standing on the corner one, one, one day and, and he said, "You know, I'm going down to, I'm going to go to art school."  I said, "Art school?" We used to hang in the pool hall, I didn't mention that, so we were at the pool hall.  He lived one direction and I lived the other, but only by two blocks from each other.  So he said he was going to this art school and I asked him, "How did you manage to do that?"  I mean you know I didn't know anything about, I thought I was going to just have to go to City College [City College of San Francisco, San Francisco, California], which was a junior college at the time.  So we had, he had invited me to come with him to go down to the school.  And I went down to the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To, to you know just to see what this was.  And they were making a film down there when I, they were making a film having to do with superstition.  It was Friday the 13th coming up or something, or maybe that was the day.  And they asked me to be in the film and to go under this ladder.  So I did that, so somehow we got to talking to the people who were doing it after that and they said well, and they found out I was, you know, art was my thing too.  And they took me to the, whoever, registrar or whatever it was, can't remember.  But they asked me to bring some art and let them see it.  And so, bring a portfolio is what they said.  So when we left, I asked Leo, "What's a portfolio?"  He told me.
Story_ID: 623457
Speaker 1: So I asked Le- Leo [Leo Valledor], "What, what, what's a portfolio?"  He said, "Look, get some of your drawings and put them together and that's all it is."  So I said, "But I don't have you know, a set of drawings that I'd like to show them."  He said, "Well you've got to bring something."  So I spent the night making drawings and stuff and we went down there.  So ended up getting a half scholarship, 50 percent scholarship to the school, to make a long story short.  And this was the California School of Fine Arts, which is now the San Francisco Art Institute [San Francisco, California], this is 1953.
Speaker 2: So you, you graduate from high school in?
Speaker 1: Fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 2: In '53 [1953] and that's from George Washington High School [George Washington Senior High School; George Washington High School, San Francisco, California], right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay so tell me what happens next.
Speaker 1: So I start this, well you mean at the art school, or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, in, in '53 [1953] you started at the art school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, September '53 [1953].  I go in as a commercial art student because I don't know anything about fine arts.  All I know is I can draw and I can make images and whatever.  And in this program it was geared to, to the advertising world.  And the other part of the school, which was really the main part of the school, was the fine art part.  But they also had a photography section which is Minor White; he probably knows Minor White.  (Laughter) But, but I didn't know anything about this stuff.  Didn't know who Minor White was, didn't know, you know, that you could even study photography.  So in the commercial art they had a basic design course and stuff that you took.  And I did very well in those and the, the second year they allowed me to do some work in the fine art area because one of the requirements was that you had to, to do certain things.  You had to learn how to weld, you had to learn certain techniques.  So we did this and got, it really just took me away from fine arts, I just went whew, okay, this is what it's really about.  So I got involved in, in that.  But at the school the problem I had was that it wasn't any real strong academic anything going on there.  You had returning Korean War veterans who were getting G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] and the way they were using it was to go to school.  Some very famous artists went to that school at that time.
Speaker 2: Such as?  Who were some of the people?
Speaker 1: I mentioned Leo Valledor, but there's a, you don't know him as famous but he did, I'm leaning, sorry.  You don't know him as famous, but his reputation is strong in San Francisco [California] and he's part of a group that, from the West Coast that did come to the New York [New York] and made an impact, but Leo died young.  And I always mention him, that's what he, he did.  But you had, see you making me lose my- (laughter).
Speaker 2: We were talking about the--
Speaker 1: I know what we were talking about.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The name of the artist is missing out of my head now, that's what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Anyway you had people coming through there like Franz Kline, whew god.
Speaker 2: It, it'll come back to you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, eventually.
Story_ID: 623458
Speaker 1: You talk about commercial art, fine art. Tell me what the difference is.
Speaker 2: Well commercial art is what you, it's just what it says.  It's art that's being created for commercial purposes, for promoting products and for that.  So in the sense that advertising art is commercial art.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what they called it then, they might call it some, they probably call it advertising now.  But that's what it is.  Fine art is, is art more for the sake of making aesthetic statements as opposed to selling a product.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there's no product involved here except the art itself.  And the school [California School of Fine Arts; San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco, California] was strong in, in that as well.  And this was the era of nonobjective art, so you had a lot of abstract art going on.  But at the school the important thing for me at that school was that I got exposed to fine arts, but they also didn't have much academic studies going on there so I decided I needed that academic thing and I, 'cause I know I'm already having problems, I don't want to bring this into the discussion.  But I was having issues with how the commercial art teacher was exposing certain students to the commercial art world whereas he wasn't exposing others who were just as good or better than the ones that he was exposing.  And you know it, it became very clear one time when I had lunch in the cafeteria with a Japanese girl and she said, "Did you go to the, to that--?" She named the studio that he had, that the teacher, our commercial art teacher had taken the artists to.  I said, "I didn't even know that was happening," you know.  She said, "Well I just heard about it this morning," but that's where they were.  I said, "And you didn't, you weren't invited?"  She said, "No," she said, "I thought you, at least you would have been there," 'cause we both were good, right?  I said, "No."  So that's when we began to peek that just a little edge of racism going on here and that was going to really impact us.  And that summer I couldn't really, I couldn't get a job for some reason.  And it was because nobody could see a black person in the commercial art field.  So I said something's wrong with this picture and I'm here studying this thing and I'm gone step out here and, and fall off of the abyss because there's nothing there for me, no bridge there, right.  So I ain't going for this.  So I said, "I'm going to go to a school where I can get some academics and get a degree that's gone make me be able to move around."  So I transferred to San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California].  But in the meantime, I had been exposed to many things.  At that school was a Diego Rivera mural that had been created during the '30s [1930s] but they had blocked it off because Diego Rivera, quote was a Communist and they didn't, you know the Communist, this whole, anti-Communist era was, was heavy.  And this was one of the things that, just like in Rockefeller Center [New York, New York] there, I don't know if you're familiar with, with that mural ['Man at the Crossroads,' Diego Rivera], but they did the same thing.  And one of my responsibilities was for this scholarship, which was 50 percent scholarship, was to sweep floors and stuff.  So one day it dawned on me that there's a wall here and yet when you go up the stairs around to where, there's a door.  Where does that door go to and there's this wall here.  So the guy who was the, the real janitor, it was a black guy.  So I asked him one day, I said, "What, tell me what's happening back here."  So he says, "I'll show you."  "Say you don't know there's a mural back there?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Yeah, I'll show you." There was a Diego Rivera.  I said, "Whoa," you know you had to be about this close to it 'cause it's just a narrow thing.  But it turned me on to the politics that was going on in, in the art world (laughter).  And I said I really need to get somewhere and find academics because it's not happening here.  They talk, I had an English teacher who was a beatnik poet named Jack Spicer.  He's got a reputation along with Ferlinghetti [Lawrence Ferlinghetti] and those guys out of the, out of North Beach in San Francisco [California].  The school was in North Beach.  But I said hey I can't, I can't you know, go down this road like this.  I got to find out what's going on in the world.  So, so that's why I transferred to, to San Francisco State and I ultimately graduated from there. But--and turned onto fine art.
Story_ID: 623459
Speaker 1: So you went to San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] in what year?
Speaker 2: I started, let's see '57 [1957] and then I got married, I stopped for a year, marriage was rough.  And had two babies.
Speaker 1: Okay so from '53 [1953] when you graduate and you go to the--
Speaker 2: Graduate from high school [George Washington Senior High School; George Washington High School, San Francisco, California] '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Right and, and then you go straight into--
Speaker 2: Two years at the California School of Fine Arts [San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco, California], that brings us to what, '55 [1955]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955], '56 [1956].  And then I go for a semester at State and then I decided I needed to, I needed a job, I needed to get a job.  So I got a job and I also went to one of the commercial art schools just to make sure that I can make this art.  Because I'm gone use this art to make a living while I go to this school, okay.
Speaker 1: So what, what commercial art school did you go to?
Speaker 2: That was the Academy of, San Francisco Academy of Art [San Francisco, California].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what's the first word?
Speaker 2: San Francisco (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, academy.
Speaker 2: --Academy of Art, or art academy, I don't know, art academy.  Look in that resume.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay so now, okay so after you, you say that, you say you get married?
Speaker 2: Got married.
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: Fifty, I want to say, I have to back up a minute.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958].
Story_ID: 623460
Speaker 1: What are you doing as far as your personal artwork?  What is it that you're creating?
Speaker 2: Okay during the time where I was not in school, I had decided I was going to use this commercial art to make some money so I was doing signs, doing windows, doing trucks, doing portraits, doing, just you know, doing art.
Speaker 1: Did you have a studio or where did you--
Speaker 2: I had a studio that, that I mentioned those two storefronts on my mother, father's property.  One of them became my studio, the one that wasn't his church became my studio.  So I had that and you know doing signs in beauty shop windows and whatever.  Real estate stuff, whatever.  So I did that.  I also was painting, so I made some paintings.  There was no opportunity for exhibitions, so that was you know, it wasn't about that.
Speaker 1: So how long did you do that before you went back to school?  This is about three years?
Speaker 2: Off and on, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 623461
Speaker 1: Tell me who you married and tell me about your children.
Speaker 2: I married a gir- a woman from, well we were young, both young, Jeanette Johnson [ph.] from Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's deceased now.  The daughters that we had are my two oldest children, Tracy Lynn [ph.] and (laughter) Lisa Kelly Spriggs [Lisa Spriggs (ph.)].
Speaker 1: And what are they doing today?
Speaker 2: Tracy is a medical assistant down in Dallas [Texas], and Lisa is an RN [registered nurse] in Trenton [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or that vicinity.  Lisa is, has two children, so she made me a grandfather.  Tracy has no children and--
Speaker 1: So those are your, you only have two children?
Speaker 2: No.  From that marriage, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That was a long time ago.  But yeah, so we divorced in about sixty--well finally '62 [1962], but we separated probably in '61 [1961].
Story_ID: 623462
Speaker 1: Okay so now we're in the 1960s and you have gotten a B.A. in art, right in sixty--1965 by the time.  Is that right, in '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell me more about what you're doing in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: What I'm doing in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Sixties [1960s], um-hm.
Speaker 2: At, at San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California]?  What year, okay I'm working at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  What year, what year did you go to the post office?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's where '57 [1957] comes in.
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957], okay.
Speaker 2: Postal clerk and discovered a way to, to make that make for me and my art, so I got to be a graphic artist in there.
Speaker 1: At the post office?
Speaker 2: Yeah because I discovered that the person who was doing graphic arts didn't have the seniority I had, so I had to fight my way into that.  And which made life much easier, much more easy (laughter).  So I'm doing that and then, and I do that up until '65 [1965], sixty, yeah just before I left.  Sixty-five [1965], I did that up until like '64 [1964], summer of '64 [1964], I can't remember.  But also at the tail end of that, I decided that, I was going to school part time.  So I wanted to be able to go to school the last semester or last year or so without having to stay up to two o'clock in the morning doing homework and all that kind of stuff.  So I decided I was gone work part time and I quit the post office and got a job developing film at a place called Jones Photo Lab [ph.], which was doing, which was doing work for Wynn Bullock, another famous photographer that was associated with California School of Fine Arts [San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco, California].  But the, the lab was run by, I can't remember his first name, but his last name was Jones [ph.].  It was Jones Photo Lab.  And while I was at San Francisco State, the instructor of, I took photograph- photography class, the instructor, helped me get that job, that's how I got that job.  And we also got involved in filmmaking on the side there with his student assistant.  And later on filmmaking comes in, but that was my first exposure to filmmaking.  And we did a film on a church in Berkeley [California] called Ephesians Church of God in Christ [Ephesian Church of God in Christ], which was about to close down the building that it was in and create a new structure.  So we convinced the minister that we could document what the church that he had built, and the old facade, how it functioned, what it looked like.  So we did that with, this is the church where 'Oh Happy Day' folks were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the two brothers.
Speaker 1: The Hawkins.
Speaker 2: That's right, Edwin Hawkins and his brother.
Speaker 1: Edwin, yeah and Walter [Walter Hawkins].
Story_ID: 623463
Speaker 1: Walter [Walter Hawkins], yeah, so 'Oh Happy Day' was not happening at that time, that had, they, they hit with that a little later.  But that's what, that was their church [Ephesian Church of God in Christ, Berkeley, California].  So it was, it was a lot of music and a lot of expression of, of you know, unknown tongue and shouting and the whole shebang.  So this film documents that part of the church as if it occurred, it's like one, one church service, but it actually occurred over like a month and a half of film, of filming.  And this is a time when we could not afford to have sync sound and, and in fact we was borrowing film from every which way so we had 100 foot rolls, and maybe sometimes plus, sometimes mix matched film, but we got it done.  And so that was just about the time I'm leaving San Francisco [California].  But at the same time at San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] we were involved in the student movement there, which we were very political at that time.  Because South Africa was happening, the, you know march and stuff was going on, Birmingham [Alabama] had occurred and all this stuff.  So we activated the students at San Francisco State and what ultimately came as the Black Student Union, was what we had created as the Negro Student Association because at that time they couldn't handle the word black in a title to refer to themselves.  So, so we acquiesce and let that be, but so it ultimately became the Black Student Union.  And that whole notion of course was that we needed some content in the courses that represented what our history was and what our blah, blah, blah, and there were people who were, you know, who could handle teaching you know, English and poetry and literature and you name it.  While I was at State, not only was I active in that, but also had, I'm a person that works hard and long and hard and intent in what I, what I get involved in.  And I, I, I took a course that gave me an opportunity to explore silkscreen processing.  So one, and it was like one of those five unit courses.  Do this project, you've got to do it from A to Z and you've got to set up a whole mechanism.  You got to create everything.  So I did, I was interested in photo silk screening at that time.  And from that project I was offered a job at State but it's too late, brother (laughter).  I want to get out of here, I want to go to New York [New York] and do some other things.  We were, we started a magazine at San Francisco State which was Black Dialogue magazine.  And it was off, actually it was off campus magazine but it was by students who were at State.  So sometimes people think it was at State, but it wasn't, it was off campus.  And out of that magazine because the poetry submissions were so heavy, another magazine emerged by a poetry editor called the Journal of Black Poetry.  So there's two magazines that came out of that student movement at San Francisco, among San Francisco State students.  Journal of Black Poetry and Black Dialogue.
Speaker 2: And what, did you write poetry?
Speaker 1: I wrote poetry, still do.  I wrote essays.  Of course I was one of those students that had to take bonehead English (laughter), and who weren't, you know, well that's another story.  But yeah I did those things.
Story_ID: 623464
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the other authors?
Speaker 2: Of the magazine [Black Dialogue]?
Speaker 1: Of the magazine.
Speaker 2: It was edited by Arthur Sheridan, and Karim Gerald Aubrey, no Gerald Labrie, Labrie [Abdul Karim].  And the editor of the poetry section was Joe Gonzalez, or Joe Goncalves, depends on how you say it, but it is spelled with a C.  And Welton Smith wrote for it, I wrote for it, Duke Williams wrote for it. Welton, did I say Welton Smith?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Okay.
Speaker 2: We were all students at State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, so explain to me about the, the black arts--
Speaker 2: Marvin X wrote for it.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Marvin X wrote for it.  Explain to you what?
Speaker 1: Well tell me how, how long did this, this go, the journal [sic.] stay alive?
Speaker 2: It was alive until around, 'til '72 [1972].  The last issue, I was the publisher of the last issue.  Everybody had, everybody was now, you know, off campus.
Speaker 1: Okay. When was the first issue, what year was it?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965].  Like, like February, something like that.
Speaker 1: Now explain to me what the Black Arts Movement was about.
Speaker 2: What was it about?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well it was about, you'd have to--
Speaker 1: What was the ideology behind it I guess would be the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well the ideology was that we needed to create images and, and information and mechanisms for promoting our art that represented us, that was by us.  And to build institutions that would perpetuate that art, okay.  So that's why, that's why Baraka [Amiri Baraka] created the Black Arts Repertory Theatre School in Harlem [New York, New York].  We had met at San Francisco State when he was out there doing a poetry reading, which is also the time when I met [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou and a few others.  And I told him I was coming to New York [New York].  So I ended up at his Black Arts Repertory Theatre School in '65 [1965] when I moved to New York, teaching a silkscreen class.  And, but the whole of the movement was to counteract some of the, the absence of ourselves in the literature in the country and the arts in general. To support theater, support you know, writers, artists, thespians.
Story_ID: 623465
Speaker 1: --That I'm an artist, I just happen to be black, and then there's time when they would say, you know we have to create black art.  So, so let's start there.  First let's go back--
Speaker 2: See you're getting away from my, my life story and talking ideology (laughter).
Speaker 1: That should be a part of your life story if it has to be with art (laughter).  Okay, all right so--
Speaker 2: I'm just teasing you.  Go ahead, do what you got to do.
Speaker 1: --we're going to go back and I wanted you to give me more information about the Black Arts Movement.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we, we had a discussion off camera that I want to bring to light about, about RAM.  And you said you were not a part of that, but you--
Speaker 2: I was emphatic about that because--
Speaker 1: --tell me what RAM stands for.
Speaker 2: Revolutionary Action Movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Trying to think of this guy's name, I forget names so easily, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: But anyway it was, it was a, it was a group that for all intents and purposes, to, to give you concise--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay so it was, it was a, it was kind of a, it was a revolutionary organization that, that's what it was about, revolution in the sense of disruptive revolution in America on the black-hand side.  So it was associated with trying to disrupt the government, overthrow it even, I guess.  But you know, and it was a nice little underground organization that several artists that I knew had associated themselves with.
Speaker 1: So you chose not to be a part of that, and, but you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As I did a lot of other things (laughter).
Story_ID: 623466
Speaker 1: So I just wanted you to expound a little more on the Black Arts Movement, and I had asked you a question about the fact that some artists would say that they were artists, you know they just happen to be black, and then there's a time when there is a, a change where people want to see art, see themselves in the art.
Speaker 2: Well I don't know how people happen to be black.  I know that they black 'cause they mommy and daddy is black, or one of them was black.
Speaker 1: No, an artist, they happen to be an artist.  They are definitely black, but they're an artist, but they didn't consider themselves a black artist.
Speaker 2: See that's where the rub comes.  How do you--
Speaker 1: I'm just throwing this out there.
Speaker 2: --I don't speak for them.  I don't agree with whatever that is they're coming from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I know that that exists, there are people who have a problem with identifying themselves as black artists because they don't, they think art is so universal, aspect of human expression that it has, it's not yellow, it's not black, it's not green, okay.  But the world and the world that we live in is white, and that white art and that white world suppresses black people's notion of themselves to the point where we have a problem accepting, that's like the students' thing when I said they couldn't handle being black student organization, so they had to be Negro student organizations, so fine, okay.  But the purpose is what's happening, it ain't the name, it ain't the label.  But you know we had, we have, I mean our history here in the Black Arts Movement is not something that was created out of thin air.  This was an outgrowth of the Harlem Renaissance and had deep roots within it, and it, but it went a step or two further than the Harlem Renaissance was, did because that generation of people had that problem too.  And that problem was because they wanted to be such a part of American culture and to be accepted so badly, that they couldn't identify themselves otherwise.  But when you find that you know, people who recognize finally, there was a consciousness that, that emerged and somebody in, in this thing said Malcolm [Malcolm X] catalyzed me.  Something that you had that I read.  And I, I think I was catalyzed before Malcolm before I knew of Malcolm, but because the thing I didn't tell you.  The first black art I ever saw was in my father's church [Shiloh Baptist Church (ph.)].  And it was Frederick Douglass, and it was hanging on one side of his, his pulpit up on the wall, and Jesus was on the other.  And I looked, I said I went to this church, we were daily church, daily, day and night.  So I saw a lot of that.
Speaker 1: So my notion of, was, was, of art was that there was Jesus and there was Frederick Douglass.  And Jesus was represented as a white man.  Frederick Douglass was represented as a black man who had quote, some courage in a system that squashed that in black people.  So I saw the role that art was, could play.  And that to get your point, question about what is Black Arts Movement.  The Black Arts Movement, if this makes any sense at all, is, was an attempt of a generation of people who came before, yeah simultaneously some with Malcolm's emergence.  But some people already had you know, exposure to certain ideas and, and things that they saw as necessary to make a shift in how saw ourselves, in how people saw us and how our next generation was going to see us.  And so this generation, '60s [1960s] generation of African American artists was intent on expressing an aesthetic that supported the beauty they saw in themselves, and to create institutions that not only had to counter what others were picturing us as, but also to perpetuate that aesthetic that was being established.  And that's why we worked at Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York], at Hammonds House [Hammonds House Museum, Atlanta, Georgia], et cetera.
Story_ID: 623467
Speaker 1: We, we passed '63 [1963] and the ma- the March on Washington.  Did you want to talk any about that time?
Speaker 2: The March on Washington?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, in '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Well yeah one of the things that propelled this whole quote, Black Arts Movement, let's go back to that, was that instance of the bombing of the Birmingham churches, church rather [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama].  And those little girls that got killed. Well that knocked a whole lot of people off their stool because, you know we had such faith in this country and in the, we thought the morals that existed.  And that this was something that could not happen here, you know, but it did.  And other things happened.  So people, artists responded to that.  Even artists like Romare Bearden responded to it.  That's why there's a group, there was a group effort among artists of his peers called Spiral group, which had Hale Woodruff, Jacob Lawrence, Jacob wasn't really in it I don't think, but Norman Lewis, a brother I can--Bill Maj-  Will Majors [William Majors] and Emma Amos was associated with it.  It's about ten of them.  They wanted to know how they could support or respond to the Civil Rights Movement as artists.  That's how, that's what, that was the catalyst for them to start and it was a hard question for them because you had in this group, artists who were grappling with this question.  I'm an artist and I'm black, which is first?  Which am I, an artist who happens to be black, or black who happens to be an artist?  So they were grappling with that.  Most artists confront that one way or another and some never accept the fact that they're, that that's a dilemma that they have to, or yeah that they have to confront, they have to grapple with.  Some of them, it destroys.
Story_ID: 623468
Speaker 1: At this time, and this is at the height of the Civil Rights Movement too because we went from '63 [1963] to '65 [1965], you graduate [from San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] and you get ready to, to leave and go to New York [New York], is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm in New York in --
Speaker 1: In '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: April of '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Now is there a time that you're a program director for the Negro Historical and Cultural Society [San Francisco Negro Historical and Cultural Society]?
Speaker 2: Yeah there's a lot that we skip over there.  This was a progressive organization if I can call it that.  It came out of the Carter G. Woodson association [Association for the Study of Negro Life and History; Association for the Study of African American Life and History], of organizations around the country.  But within it were a lot of people who had progressive ideas and were fellow travelers, etcetera.  Some of them from the labor union, some of them from just teachers or whatever, but people who found the need to, in San Francisco [California] the population min- of black people was so small that there was very little culture that was celebrated there among black people.  I mean we had the churches, we sang, we had jazz groups and blah, blah, blah.  But the Paul Robesons, the Langston Hugheses, the plays and all this, they never quite got that way.  But the history also of our, of the people was not being perpetuated.  So this group was one of those groups that tried to bring to light the history, the struggles and the successes of black people internationally.  So as a progressive group, I saw them as a, as a means to allow for some cultural activities dealing with visual arts.  And so they in fact allowed me to, to mount some exhibitions and to create, you know, whatever they needed visually, visual arts wise.  And one of my, the first time I ever curated anything was through them and it was a Bay Area wide [San Francisco Bay Area, California] exhibition of artists who had never, and I have to say, I have to make a parenthetical statement here.  There were no avenues for exhibitions among African American artists, they didn't hardly even know each other except, you know small pockets of them.  But I said this was a Bay Area wide and it was that because I saw that because I was involving myself in exhibitions, I showed in the Richmond watercolor and drawing show [Richmond Art Center, San Francisco, California], I showed in Walnut Creek [Civic Arts Gallery, Walnut Creek, California].  These were kind of known exhibitions entities in the Bay Area, but black artists were never involved in them.  But I was accepted in them.  I mean I put my work in there.  I showed up in, in Walnut Creek to receive a prize it was like, wow.  But we had, we had no opportunities to show our community our work.  And our community wasn't going to these other places because this wasn't in their, you know, it's not Sunday church, okay.  So I decided that I would do an exhibition that's going to, that's going to cover the Bay Area artists.  And there was an opportunity because the Negro Historical Cultural Society, I'm already functioning with them, got a relationship going with a new hotel that was opening in San Francisco on a major street, Van Ness Avenue near Geary [Boulevard], and the hotel was called Jack Tar Hotel.  And they gave us permission to do this exhibition there.  Now we had, we didn't have, we didn't have anything in terms of exhibition material or anything like that.  So what we did was we went to a couple of the construction companies who were, who when they put up a building, they used these four by eight sheets of plywood to, to form the, the concrete and stuff.  And so we got permission to come in there and get as many of those as we needed as long as we were going to return them after this period, and used them to create panels for an exhibition.  So we outfitted this hotel space that we were allowed with that and we had enough places to hang art for all this art around the Bay Area.  So that was the first, and it was a major undertaking.
Story_ID: 623469
Speaker 1: Who were some of the artists that were included in this exposition?
Speaker 2: Claude Clark, most of them names are kind of obscure at this point, they're Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], Banjo [ph.], sorry--
Speaker 1: If you can't remember, that's fine, that's fine.  Okay and is there anything else that we missed while you were in San Francisco [California] that you were involved in that we didn't talk about?
Speaker 2: Well you know I wasn't always making art.  Some Saturdays I was taking kids to, I was taking kids to Chinatown [San Francisco, California] to swim.  I mean I had the other side of me.  But no I guess that covers it.  I mean I had--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you decided to go to New York [New York] and, and tell me once again how you decided to go to New York.
Speaker 2: How.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Well first of all I was from the East Coast remember, Delaware.  Not New York, Delaware.  And leaving as we did when we did, I was always kind of focused on going back east you know.  And it, after I got involved in the arts, then it became New York.  Why would I go to Dover [Delaware]?  Why would I go to Penns Grove [New Jersey]?  New York, you know that's where people are.  So the summer of '64 [1964] me and a couple other students took one of those drive back cars, taking the car back, thing.  And we drove to, these guys just wanted to get to the East Coast and whatever, and I wanted to get to New York.  So we did and I got to Harlem [New York, New York] and I got to Brooklyn [New York] and I got a chance to look around and see and get exposed to all these people.  Big contracts, big, you know it wasn't quite a culture shock as such 'cause I read all I could read about Harlem and places like that.  But it was such a contrast to growing up in San Francisco I said I'm coming back here for sure.  So I set my mind on it when I graduated [from San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] and since my marriage [to Jeanette Johnson (ph.)] was dissolved, I was out of there.
Speaker 1: Okay so you landed--
Speaker 2: Landed in, in Harlem.
Speaker 1: --in Harlem, okay.
Speaker 2: Actually landed, actually landed, actually landed in, in Brooklyn first.
Story_ID: 623470
Speaker 1: What are some of the first things that you do as far as your, your artwork or were you into filmmaking at this time?
Speaker 2: I was doing, I was an editor to those magazines [Black Dialogue and Journal of Black Poetry] at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was moving around with a lot of writers and I was reading poetry and organizing poetry readings, involved with the Countee Cullen Library [New York, New York] and the Schomburg library [Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature, History and Prints; Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].  Politically we were, you know, in committees called Save the Schomburg [Save the Schomburg Collection], sorry.  And--
Speaker 1: Save the Schomburg?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was going on with the Schomburg?
Speaker 2: The Schomburg is a part of New York public libraries [New York Public Library, New York, New York] but there was always a threat that they're coming to take the books out of there and take them over to Columbia University [New York, New York] and dah, dah, dah, dah.  Because someone threw up a big scare by saying that well a ten year old child can come into the Schomburg and handle documents, and you could, you could.  And that ain't no good.  We need to have these things copied and, and, dah, dah, dah.  So let's take them out of the Schomburg and, and give them to 3M company and let 3M company copy.  So we said no, you ain't taking nowhere, you know, you need any copying, copy it here.  Well that was the tenor of the time, you didn't trust them.  Them, the man, right, library system.  Jean Blackwell Hutson was the chief person at the library at the time and she was a sweet lady, but she was, she wasn't up to the political side of it.  She wanted, wanted to have you be political for her, but, but she wasn't you know, but, so we had people meeting with her like Frederick O'Neal, Bearden [Romare Bearden] was on the Harlem Cultural Council at the time.  And, and then some just ordinary activist people.  So that was one of the things I was involved in.  I started the, after the repertory theatre school thing got crazy, I started going to Brooklyn [New York] and working with some kids, some youth there.  Started a short lived workshop over there in silk screening because a guy gave me a space to do it in.  All the while I'm doing poetry readings and I'm collecting material for these magazines.  I meet, I meet some SN- former SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] photographers, Doug Harris and Rufus Hinton.  And of course I already know Larry Neal from the Black Arts Repertory Theatre School [New York, New York].  And I meet Jim Hinton [James Hinton] and so we ultimately decided to, we had a need, the same kind of need that we wanted to document certain things, so why don't we start a film company.  We started a group called Harlem Audio Visual, Harlem Audio Visuals [New York, New York].  And the five of us was what it was, Larry Neal, Jim Hinton, Rufus Hinton, not related to Jim, Doug Harris and myself.  And we proceeded to do certain kinds of documentaries.  We were more involved, more warranted to handle activist stuff.  And we didn't want to just, well some of us didn't just want to be a film company.  But we ultimately dissolved because others wanted to make it a commercial, more commercial oriented group to do Hollywood if they could, you know.  So I mean that's cool for them, y'all go for it (laughter).
Story_ID: 623471
Speaker 1: Is this the same time that the, the World Festival of Negro Arts opens in Senegal [First World Festival of Black Arts, Dakar, Senegal]?
Speaker 2: That's '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay so what year are we talking?  Cause you got there in '65 [1965]. How long does, you know, when do you all form this group?
Speaker 2: I was not involved in the '66 [1966] festival.
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about the year, you came to New York [New York] in '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then y'all formed this group.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay so you still involved in this group in '66 [1966], right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  How long did the group stay--
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966], the group hasn't even started.
Speaker 1: Well what year was the group, did the group start?  Yeah, audiovisual [Harlem Audio Visuals, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: When did it start, okay.  I would say it really started, it really started '67 [1967], we might have been talking and stuff in '66 [1966], but it wasn't doing any work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But '66 [1966], that is when the Dakar festival happened, the first of those festivals.  And was one of the reasons we got involved in the second one[Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria] was because the first one was a handpicked project with the government involved and just picking luminary artists to go to this festival.  And so the people who were making art in the Black Arts Movement period was not selected for that.  So Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller] who was managing Black World, remember, are you old enough to remember Negro Digest? Huh?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well Hoyt Fuller was the managing editor of that.  He didn't like the idea that for the '66 [1966] Dakar festival, they had chosen a white woman to lead the contingent and they did it along with a group of black people who were in what was called AMSAC, American Society of African Culture, which was a CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] infiltrated group, this is proven.
Story_ID: 623472
Speaker 1: We established that Harlem Video, Audio Visual [Harlem Audio Visuals, New York, New York] is, is founded in 1965.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And we were just finished up talking about the festival [First World Festival of Black Arts, Dakar, Senegal] and how people were selected.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so tell me what, what happens next as far as, as the company.  You saying, you said that they kind of wanted to switch (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah that was what caused the demise.  But we were doing films for some network, not films, but documenting some activities for some of the networks.  We did, we worked for A. Philip Randolph, well actually Ernie Green [HistoryMaker Ernest Green] (yawns), Ernie Green was, I have forgotten his title now but before he went to work for Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], he was working with A. Philip Randolph and he hired us to doc- document their apprenticeship training program or something to that effect.  But they had a building trades program to create, train guys to, and women I guess, to work in the building trades.  So we were documenting that program.  We did Poor People's Campaign, Tent City down in Washington [D.C.].  I think they had Baraka's [Amiri Baraka] efforts to get Ken Gibson [HistoryMaker Kenneth Gibson] elected over in Newark [New Jersey] and also documented his Spirit House activities while we were over there in Newark.  We did some shooting for, there used to be a commentator named David Shoenburg [ph.], Shoenbaum  [ph.], Shoenburg back in the, I can't remember, but we did work for him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but we were such a group that you know every guy could bring his own project to the, to the group, or he can go off and shoot, do whatever he wants to do, you know.  If he wants to bring the group, then he can produce it and we just do the work, like that.
Speaker 1: So how long did you do that work?  How long did that go on?
Speaker 2: Actually I went to the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] in '65 [1965] and--
Speaker 1: In '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Yeah to the Studio Museum I went to, but I was still doing a little bit of that, so it overlapped with my work at Studio Museum for maybe the first year.  Actually Jim Hinton [James Hinton] was on the board at the Studio Museum.
Speaker 1: Okay and is this around the time that 'Black Fire' ['Black Fire: An Anthology of Afro American Writing,' Amiri Baraka and Larry Neal] is published?
Speaker 2: 'Black Fire' was published in, well 'Black Fire' is published in '68 [1968] I think it is.
Speaker 1: Okay so it's after that though, after that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 623473
Speaker 1: What position do you have at the Studio Museum?
Speaker 2: Executive director.  Cha, cha, cha (laughter).
Speaker 1: So tell me which role is there, what, what, what is it that you hope to accomplish as director?
Speaker 2: Well the story of the Studio Museum at the time was to kind of track it.  The, now I mentioned Schomburg [Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature, History and Prints; Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] and that stuff.  I was an activist around the town, around Harlem [New York, New York] that is.  And the Studio Museum started in September of 1968.  I went there in July of '69 [1969].  Sixty-eight [1968] they started with a guy that they thought would be a good executive director because he had some financial background from Wall Street.  So they hired this guy, Charles Innis, who knew nothing about art.  He was from, he lived in Harlem but he didn't really know the community in a way that he needed to know it to be a, that kind of organization in the community.  So they ran into problems right away.  When they opened the place in September of '68 [1968], they had, I mean it was a fantastic opening, you know, torch lights, finger food passed all around, rubbing elbows with people from business, black and white, Carter Burden [Shirley Carter Burden], people from Wall Street, people from the arts world, Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York], Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York, New York].  But at that opening, they had decided for that first exhibition to show this artist whose name was Tom Lloyd, now deceased.  Tom Lloyd was doing programmed lights.  In order to get the community ready for Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York], they had been telling the community that they were going to show black art here.  Well that question you asked earlier about I'm an artist and am I black, blah, blah, blah, caught them in a trap because to them Tom Lloyd was a black artist.  He was black, but he wasn't doing black art.  So at that opening his program lights was blinking and carrying on, and some young guy came up in there and it was like I mean the place was packed.  He smashed one of the pieces with his fist, wham, "This ain't no goddamn black art.  You told us we was gone have black art in here.  This ain't no fucking black art."  TV cameras was on him and everything.  So from there on it was downhill for them.  This is September of '68 [1968].  The community just, you know, spaced on them.  So wasn't nobody coming to the joint.  They didn't even come to see the Panther exhibition ['The Vanguard: A Photographic Essay on the Black Panthers'].  It was a photographic exhibition of the Panthers [Black Panther Party] by Pirkle Jones and Marion, Marion [Ruth Marion Baruch], I can't think of her name right now, but his wife, that was excellent, you know.  If you've seen any Panther book, their photographs are in there.  Okay so they lost, you know, credibility in the community and so they were looking for somebody to, to help them with that, right.  That's how I got in the door.  Okay and when I came in the door, I said, "You did promise the community," (laughter).  "Now we gone give it to them," (laughter).  So I started bringing in artists from California, Chicago [Illinois], if you're from Chicago, you're familiar with AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists]?  I brought them in there twice.  This is what gave them a lift.
Story_ID: 623474
Speaker 1: Tell us about AfriCOBRA (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well anyway, so my notion was to give a platform for African American artists, not necessarily the ones that the Metropolitan [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] or the, not the Met- the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] or the Whitney [Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York] would choose because most of them were just, were doing, while some of them were very good doing abstract work and doing geometric work and doing pop art type of work.  There were black artists who were not getting any play at all and everything that's going on like AfriCOBRA, which was creating an aesthetic that they believed you know, was based on things that, and qualities that black people related to.  So I said this is very interesting.  This is what we've been talking about all along, you know, so let's put, let's mount this [at the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York].  So it brought them in and it was a smash, so I brought them back another year too.
Speaker 1: AfriCOBRA, some of the same people were involved with the, the Wall of Respect, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah. The African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists. But they were not involved as AfriCOBRA in that.  They were involved as, it will come to me in a minute.  There was an organization, OBAC, that this guy I mentioned, Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller] mentored.  It was not just visual artists, it was writers, it was theater people and whatever in this OBAC, Organization of Black American Culture, OBAC.  And so out of that some of the artists, [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson, principally, created AfriCOBRA, but it was not an OBAC created thing, the Wall of Respect was, okay.  So anyway that's, that's a short version of--
Story_ID: 623475
Speaker 1: So some of the expositions like 'Thru Black Eyes.'
Speaker 2: 'Thru Black Eyes,' Roy DeCarava.
Speaker 1: That was something that you brought in, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah one of many.  But it, Roy DeCarava is pretty prominently known by people who know American photography at this point.  But back in those days, he was only known vaguely by those people who knew of the work that he and Langston Hughes had done in a book called 'Sweet Flypaper of Life' ['The Sweet Flypaper of Life'].  But Roy DeCarava was kind of a catalyst for a lot of black photographers during the era of the '60s [1960s] in that he was not a journalist photographer like say [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks.  He was a fine art photographer, but he focused more on jazz musicians and whatever.  If it was in the community, he would shoot it but it would be fine art when he finished with it.  You know it wouldn't be some journalistic expose type of photograph you know.  So for us, for me he was you know, he was a world apart from Gordon Parks and he had, he had this, there's a group of artists, photographers right now called Kormangi [ph.] that he mentored that is a functioning group of high level, black photographers.  I was trying, I don't know of any of them from Chicago [Illinois].  But they would all know Sentac [ph.], Sentac (unclear).  Anyway Roy was like the dean of black American fine art photography, excepting the old man, let's my, with these names, boy, Van Der Zee [James Van Der Zee], with the exception of Van Der Zee (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Van Der Zee.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 623476
Speaker 1: Tell me how long do you stay there and talk to me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm there until '75 [1975], '74 [1974] or '75 [1975].  Hold on.  Cause from there I go to Harlem--I mean to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Before you leave Studio Museum, were there, besides the different exhibitions, were there other programs that you developed?
Speaker 2: Yeah well they, the Studio Museum has its name because their decision was that they would have an artist in residence there.  And by the time I got there, remember they went through all this turmoil, they had not really set that in motion.  They had decided on a guy named [HistoryMaker] William T. Williams, noted African American abstract expressionist artist, who was to take in one or two artists into his studio and show them the world.  Well when I got there, I'm saying this is too minimal.  You got a big name here, Studio Museum and you're gone have one or two artists in the studio?  No.  When Harlem artists don't have a studio at all, you can't even, there's nobody I can, I can take you to a studio.  So we need to create a space for more than that.  So we created a print workshop ran by Valerie Maynard.  We created an artist in residence program that, that allowed about five artists in there year round and gave them space, 24/7 access.  And there was already a film workshop there ran by Randy Abbott, which wasn't making any films.  So I had to get rid of that, which I did and everybody, I got hated for a minute for that, but I had to, it was a drain.  Wasn't making no film.  [HistoryMaker] Julie Dash went to that workshop.  And since you're a local, you might know Killingsworth, (Unclear) Killingsworth [ph.].  (Unclear) was really right hand man for Randy Abbott in that workshop.  This was in his younger years.  But anyway those are two people whose names you might know that was involved.  There was a couple other people but, Monica Freedman [ph.] for one, filmmaker.  So we did those programs.  We also did, we created a regular Kwanzaa activity there which was so popular that we had to close the doors sometimes to keep people out because it just got too many people.  But we had Chuck Davis dancing in the Kwanzaa, we had, you know different things like we had jazz performances, poetry readings, film screenings, an educational program, education program.  Got involved with the school system, teaching teachers in the school system.  And you know had school kids coming up in the retaking workshops and stuff.  And we sent artists out to schools.  We, we mounted exhibitions that toured.
Story_ID: 623477
Speaker 1: What about your fundraising?
Speaker 2: What about it?
Speaker 1: Tell me how you raised funds for, for the programs.
Speaker 2: Well some of that was New York State Council on the Arts which was a big funder for us.  A little bit of it at that time was endowment.  We had a board of directors that was led by Carter Burden [Shirley Carter Burden], Carter Burden, Carter Burden, he was this guy.  He's a bloodline from the Cunard shipping [sic.], whatever, and his brother, his brother-in-law was on the board, he was Lehman Brothers [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.].  So we had people like that involved on the board.  They were the thrust for money from different sources.  Eleanor Holmes Norton was on the board.  She didn't raise no money, but she was on the board.  So our fundraising on that level was through the access that these folks had.  They were connected to the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] because their fathers and mothers were involved, on boards of those, Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] and the museum.  And we started a group called the Harlem Council, no let me see.  Yeah, Harlem Council for the Studio Museum [ph.], it was a fundraising group of black women mostly.
Speaker 1: So you were able to increase your budget and, and your staff by the time you left, or not?
Speaker 2: When I went there we had, there was a secretary and there was Randy Abbott running the film thing.  That was it.  When I left there was about, maybe sixteen staff, about sixteen.  So yeah to answer your question.  But I was not a fundraiser.
Story_ID: 623478
Speaker 1: How do you get to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I was actually invited to come to Howard to, by [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson, who is now at Howard as head of the art department.  He was from Chicago [Illinois], one of the co-founders of AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists].  So I had an inside track.
Speaker 1: So what did you do there?
Speaker 2: I lectured in art history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what type of, did you develop syllabuses or--
Speaker 2: Well sure, you got to have a syllabus to teach.  But, sorry about that.  But I curated faculty exhibitions as well.
Speaker 1: And I see here too that it says that you wrote the principal catalogue essay.
Speaker 2: For Howard?
Speaker 1: For Howard.
Speaker 2: That was a faculty exhibition.
Speaker 1: Okay (cough), excuse me.  I'm sorry.  So tell me more about Howard.  You're there for just one year?
Speaker 2: Just one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to Nigeria from Howard.
Speaker 1: Is that where you met Donna [HistoryMaker Opalanga D. Pugh] during this trip?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 623479
Speaker 1: Tell me, tell me about how you, how you go to Nigeria?
Speaker 2: Well in 1960- 1973 or so, there was a, an effort, this 1966 festival [First World Festival of Black Arts] that was held in Dakar [Senegal] named Nigeria as the next site.  They were the star country in '66 [1966], meaning that they would do the next festival.  Well Nigeria had the, they had the, they had the Igbo war, what's Igbo Biafran War [Nigerian Civil War], battle, and so they could, they messed up in terms of timing.  So finally they got themselves together in the '70s [1970s] and then with their oil money and stuff and decided it's time to do.  But they wanted the military rule and all that.  Then they had a coup in the middle of planning for that, in 1975 and I'm over there at a meeting because I'm on the board of our national effort.  Remember I said Hoyt [Hoyt W. Fuller] didn't like the fact that 1966 there was this hand appointed committee of people [American Society of African Culture] who was selecting just the luminary artists to go and represent black American art and culture at the, Dakar.  But so through his magazines [Negro Digest; Black World] over the years he was promoting against that.  And by the time Nigeria got ready, they sent their man over, swashbuckling with all this oil money and stuff and held a big meeting over in Chicago [Illinois] at Ebony magazine and called all the history makers in the arts to Chicago for that meeting.  And this man, Anahiro [ph.] was his name, invited us to bring twenty-five hundred artists to Nigeria for this festival, all expenses paid.  Excuse me?  Would you repeat that?  All expenses paid.  So we began organizing the states.  We cut this monster up into eight regions and we put a director in each region and we created committees for the different disciplines.  I had the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut region 'cause I was in New York [New York].  And so that's when I was going back and forth.  So I went over to a film meeting, to organize how the film section of the festival was going to go down.  [HistoryMaker] Charles Hobson along with, and I were together on that trip, actually.  And that coup occurred while we there, so we were there about eleven days instead of like three or four days.  And that's how I met Donna.  We had this time to kill.  And I don't know, somehow we hooked up with them.
Speaker 1: So, now you're organizing to get this together so what happens?
Speaker 2: Well, this festival, that was the first, one of the first postponements because of the coup.  So it actually didn't happen until '77 [1977] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seven [1977], okay, okay.
Speaker 2: By the time it happened, I'm working over there because we decided there was so many things happening that we wasn't apprised of and what's going down that we didn't want it to go that way, we needed somebody over there so that when the international meetings came, we would know what the deal was.  So the, the person whose place I was taking at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] came back.  So it became okay, we need to send somebody over there.  So I said well look, I ain't doing nothing right now.  I'm not looking for nothing and I ain't doing nothing.  So I go.  So I go.  And what it was, was the festival zones, we were the North American zone.  We had, we could send somebody over there to work in the international secretary to help develop the festival, that's who I was.  So I went as a exhibition, principal exhibition officer to the Second World Festival [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria].  And you know, the rest is history (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, you have to tell us what the history is (laughter).  Just to clarify when we say that's when you met Donna, that was Donna Pugh [HistoryMaker Opalanga D. Pugh] who was a story teller, who happens to be a HistoryMaker.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: (Cough).
Speaker 2: Whose picture I just saw in the book that you showed me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --and I recognized her.
Speaker 1: She, she passed away last year.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 623480
Speaker 1: So, now you know you can now tell me the rest of this history.  Tell me what happens next.
Speaker 2: (Cough) Wow okay what happens next is so we're, we're, we're, I'm over there working, am I?  So I'm working as exhibition officer.  My positions and stuff that I was doing while I was in the states, been passed on to some other people.  Because of the coups and because of the political uproar in the country about spending so much money for a festival [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria] when Nigeria needs so much, its people need so much.  It got to be very hot, politically, the festival did.  So they cut the money.  So that twenty-five hundred people that we were taking--and remember we started organizing--we had to cut back.  We ended up having to cut back to five hundred.  Yeah, so we got all these people that we have talked to and gotten information for and got, anticipated, high anticipation for going to this festival, including high level musician groups, jazz groups, theater groups, artists, blah, blah, blah.  So with the, with the postponements and there was two I guess since that coup occurred, we had to really scale back which meant that we lose credibility among a lot of artists and we changed schedules because the dates of the festival changed.  The dates of the festival changed so that what happens with a music group that's scheduled to go, scheduled themselves to go at a certain time and then you change the dates, you just throw a whack into them.  So that happened.  So finally the festival occurs and we have two planeloads of people, we have five hundred people, artists, to go.  I mean these are artists, some of whom are your HistoryMakers from all over the country because remember we organized it that way.  Whereas the 1966 festival [First World Festival of Black Arts, Dakar, Senegal] was strictly those luminaries, the Duke Ellingtons and the Langston Hugheses and blah, blah, blah.  And most of them were based in New York if they weren't pulled out of Europe somewhere.  So this is how we got five hundred people there, but we had problems because the first plane, the second plane we didn't have secured.  And we had to rattle state department [U.S. Department of State], they, Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus] to put pressure on Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] or whoever and asked Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] to intercede.  We finally got the second one.  So five hundred people, five hundred artists went to that festival.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now that's an unsung story.  You don't see it nowhere.
Speaker 1: Okay we're going to stop right here.
Speaker 2: And if The HistoryMakers were smart, they would do that, they would do that story, because five hundred black American artists for the first time interfaced in Africa with African artists from all over the dias- the-- Africa and the diaspora (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 623481
Speaker 1: There are five hundred artists that go to the festival [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria], just give us a, a list or some of the names of some of the artists that, that participated.
Speaker 2: We had Ernest Crichlow, Joe Delaney [Joseph Delaney], [HistoryMaker] Samella Lewis, Faith Ringgold, Wadsworth Jarrell [HistoryMaker Wadsworth A. Jarrell, Sr.], Ellsworth Ausby, just recently died, Adimodo Olu Bofoya [ph.], you work with that one (laughter).  Ed Sherman [Edward Sherman], I think it was Ed Sherman, and those are visual artists.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Barbara Ann Teer's National Black Theatre, the Kuumba Workshop [Kuumba Theater Company] out in Chicago [Illinois], Abena Brown [HistoryMaker Abena Joan P. Brown], Chicago theater group, Cleo Robinson [HistoryMaker Cleo Parker Robinson].
Speaker 1: Texas.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He's [sic. She's] not from Texas?
Speaker 2: Denver [Colorado], somewhere like that, Colorado, somewhere in Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We, we had people like Valerie Maynard, Carole Byard, Marilyn Nance.
Speaker 1: I'm sure you're not going to remember all five hundred, so--
Speaker 2: No I'm not gone remember all five, but that's, that's a slice of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 623482
Speaker 1: How successful was the festival [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria]?
Speaker 2: From whose point of view?
Speaker 1: Your point of view.
Speaker 2: Okay. From my point of view, it was successful in that we got people there.  It was a real struggle.  And they got, they  had a, they had a ex- they had a life shaking experience, not life, life changing experience at the festival part where they were in the village that was created to house the artists because each of the countries' artists were in this village.  And at night the music and the dancing and the comradeship, the whole thing was fantastic for the artists.  The festival itself was an exposure to various cultures in Africa which I guess was, was an opportunity, a first time opportunity for most of our artists going there to, to experience.  Because you had arts that happened in relation to the design and decoration of boats that were in a, a regalia.  You had a Durbar which is a whole, big thing in the northern part of Nigeria where horsemen are doing their thing.  You had Fela [Fela Kuti] and most of our people got a chance to visit Fela's shrine [Afrika Shrine, Ikeja, Nigeria] and the Black Madonna, not Black Madonna, but shrine.  And you had a lot of the people, Nigerian people were fantastic, they were very welcoming of the folks.  It was successful from that point of view.  I guess where it failed was on our own side, documenting what we, we had done.  And so that's why there's no document and I say that HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] ought to get on that before I finish my book on it.  So yeah it was a success.  And the people who I, you know I'm in touch with a lot of artists and I go back and forth to New York [New York] often.  They're still, you know, this is, this is thirty something years later.  They are still vibing off of that.  So I mean that trip was a fantastic thing for, for people.  Some of them art changed, changed their art.  This one artist I'll name just because he's really an exceptional, he, he was, he's, he's more, he's more of a abstract expressionist artist named [HistoryMaker] William T. Williams.  Google him one day and see what he's doing.  But it affected him, so his abstract expressionist art and the patterns that he was using changed, yeah.  So because, what you see over there, what you get exposed to is just this fantastic array of, of people who are wearing art in their clothes every day.  You know their clothes, they don't wear no drab stuff like this.  They got designs and stuff everywhere, you know, and designs on top of designs and we look at it and we say wait a minute, you can't mix that.  They're doing it.  They say who say we can't (laughter).  So it, you know it affected a lot of people that way.  And mainly that it did expose some people who had never made that trip before to contemporary Africa.
Story_ID: 623483
Speaker 1: How did it affect you personally?
Speaker 2: Big time.  I knew a lot about Nigeria before I went, before I even started making those trips because I was in love with Yoruba art, traditional Yorba art.  So I read a lot and studied it a lot and looked at it a lot.  But I was able to interact with on a personal level, with a spiritual leader over there who it turns out had been a person that many of the people that we know about here in this country who got involved with traditional Yoruba culture.  Went to, I didn't realize that when I, when I was introduced to him.  But he be- he was, he was, he was like an encyclopedia of Nigerian history and, and the Yoruba religious culture.
Speaker 1: Who is this?
Speaker 2: He's deceased now, yeah.
Speaker 1: What's his name?  You'll think of it in a minute.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you make me, 'cause see I have my personal thought of him is not his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway I'll come back to it.  He invited me to bring, well he invited me to come to a meeting of Shango priests because he, he has a level, his level in the priesthood thing was such that the people in his region who were meeting of a certain category of, of Yoruba priests, like Shong- who deal with Shango, Shango is a orisha. Orisha is like a god, a spiritual entity that, gosh, it relates to thunder and lightning, but his, his powers is one thing, but he's got a cult that follows him.  And these people were holding a meeting.  It just so happens that Ivan Dixon took my spot in terms of the film section of the festival [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria] from the states. Ivan Dixon the producer, filmmaker who's deceased now.  He came over at the time when that meeting was happening and I took him to that and he was like, I mean he was like (laughter).  It just blew him away, but that was one of the highlights for me to be able to expose somebody who'd never been around any of that before, to that and then they become much more, you know, conversant and interested in that sort of thing.  But when I say it affected me profoundly, I saw things that I won't go into here, but I saw things that, that were, that were amazing.  And I met people who were there that I didn't expect to find, to meet there.  Yeah, every time you make me try to think of somebody's name, it goes farther away.  The boxer, god, this is terrible.
Story_ID: 623484
Speaker 1: When you return, where do you go from there?  Do you stay at the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, no, I'm finished with the Studio Museum at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I returned to, to the states, I'm, I took a job, well the next job I took was at the Astoria Motion Picture and Television Center [Astoria, New York].  I did some, I did some work with, with Hazel Bryant [Hazel Joan Bryant] and the Afro- and the Richard Allen Afro American theater [Richard Allen Center for Culture and Arts, New York, New York].  And I did some freelance stuff.  But the job I took was with Astoria Motion Picture and Television Center, and this was shortly after 'The Wiz' was done.  That's where it was done.  But they decided they wanted to do a job, they wanted to do a, they looked at the film training situation.  You had Columbia film school [Columbia University, New York, New York], you had NYU film school [New York University, New York, New York] and you had one or two in the region.  But there was no way for them to interface with the industry for real because the schools weren't providing that.  So they set up this program and called me into design it, to bring industry activists like set designers, directors, writers, you name it, into, to, to, to, to lecture and expose these students who, ex-students, really, graduate students in film, to real world of these disc- these disciplines within the film industry.  So that's what that was.
Speaker 1: And this was, was this in '80 [1980] to '81 [1981]?
Speaker 2: No, '80 [1980] I come here [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: New York, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '80 [1980]. '80 [1980] I come here.
Story_ID: 623485
Speaker 1: What brings you to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Mainly because I was looking for, to get out of New York [New York] and I really kind of wanted to be in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], but when I really looked at it, I didn't want to be in D.C.  What really got me here was a job with the Southern Arts Federation [South Arts, Atlanta, Georgia], which was a regional arts organization that had advertised in the arts papers or whatever, for a position of information officer slash minority affairs.  And here I'm saying, "Damn man, I'm gone move down south one way or another, let me look at this job."  So I actually ended up with the job.  They had had a previous person who practically went crazy because this was ten southeastern states.  They had never considered funding African American art, artists, arts organizations, et cetera in any real way.  And likewise the art, the African American communities in these states, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, you know, so and so and so, never made much of an effort to access the funds, which was the tax dollars.  So what they really needed was somebody to help them understand how to do this.  So they passed this to this information position, you know, that they had and that's what I came in on.  So I was able to travel around the ten states and do little workshops and whatever.
Speaker 1: And helped them access the funds.
Speaker 2: Yes indeed.  Get the money.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so you do that for just a year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was an NEA funded thing.
Speaker 1: NEA.
Speaker 2: NEA, National Endowment for the Arts.  And at that point, there was some strong efforts to get funding to minorities through the NEA and any of these organizations who wasn't making an effort, they wasn't gone get--I mean in these umbrella organizations like the state arts agencies, they had--they were, they were, they were under the microscope for this.
Story_ID: 623486
Speaker 1: What happens next?
Speaker 2: What happens, oh from there I go to Fulton County Arts Council.  Another NEA [National Endowment for the Arts] funded position, to, there was a program that would give artists money for studio space, for marketing, and PR [public relations].  And so I came in to Fulton County Arts Council doing that, and I was the third staff person there under Tom Cullen.
Speaker 1: What are you doing, what are you doing with your artwork?  What, what are you doing?
Speaker 2: Why you jump off the subject and take me there (laughter)?
Speaker 1: 'Cause I, I, all of a sudden I just, I, I, just--
Speaker 2: Well I write, I write, I write and I--
Speaker 1: I'm gone take you back to that subject.
Speaker 2: That's okay.  I write and one day I might, you might see some art.
Speaker 1: Okay I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, to interrupt a thought.  But I was just thinking we hadn't talked about your artwork or writings or films or anything in a couple of years here, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I was just wondering.  But okay, go back to, to the Fulton County (unclear).
Speaker 2: This hasn't been a good space for me to do art yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it has not gone from my, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay so go back to where you were and what did you accomplish there?  You were there for two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah and we got an opportunity, we saw, we saw that the, this place called Hammonds House [Hammonds House Museum, Atlanta, Georgia], which was then a home of Dr. Otis T. Hammonds, who was a doctor who collected art but he was also a doctor who was during the '80s [1980s] he, he ran, he was chairman of something called the Neighborhood Arts Center [Atlanta, Georgia].  And he was on the board at the High Museum [High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia].  He's one of those few blacks who was interfacing with the white art world here, white art institutions.  And but he was also a person who got to know the Beardens and collected Bearden works [Romare Bearden].  If Alvin Ailey was coming to town, he would hold a soiree at his house for them.  So he had cache in, you know, a lot.  But he developed leukemia, leukemia, how do you say it?
Speaker 1: Leukemia.
Speaker 2: Leukemia and while he had purchased this, this Victorian house that kind of laid fallow for a number of years in the West End [Atlanta, Georgia] because he had this big art collection.  He wanted a place to have his soirees and show off his art and et cetera, et cetera.  But he died before he was able to, he got the place renovated somewhat and, and then he died.  Well under [HistoryMaker] Michael Lomax you had a library bond referendum going on.  And the library that we know as Auburn Avenue Library [Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History, Atlanta, Georgia], he thought was going to be able to put in that spot where the Hammonds House is now.  But the engineers told him no, we can't do that.  So, but it was purchased from, from O.T. Hammonds' mother or family through the library referendum.  Well, and the library had no use for it after that.  So I'm working for Fulton County Arts Council and I approach, and I learned that this place is sitting there and I approach Chuck Williams [Charles Williams] who was, who was the city council [Atlanta City Council] person for, for, living in the West End at that time and simply said to him that, you know, this is perfect for a museum, blah, blah, blah.  His assistant at the time was Cleta Winslow and he said well give me a proposal.  So the next morning he had my proposal.  And I transitioned out of Fulton County Arts Council into creating this museum.
Story_ID: 623487
Speaker 1: So tell me what you had to do to get this house [Hammonds House Museum, Atlanta, Georgia] ready for the purposes?  What was your long term goal?
Speaker 2: Well when I got there this house, there were three houses in the block.  I don't know if you know that area, but there's three houses on Peeples Street and there was no houses across the street.  You could see all the way to what was then Ashby Avenue [sic. Ashby Street; Joseph E. Lowery Boulevard].  And going down Peeples and the freeway runs on one side of it and that's what created this crazy spot when they decided not to do the freeway there.  But they had destroyed all the houses back there in the day, see.  And so it became kind of a desolate area.  We, we had just the, the funeral home, Watkins Funeral Home [Willie A. Watkins Funeral Home, Atlanta, Georgia] at, at what was then Ralph, not Ralph David Avenue [Ralph David Abernathy Boulevard], it was Georgia Avenue or something.  And then these three houses.  At the time the West End library [West End Branch, Atlanta, Georgia], which is now in the, the block behind Watkins, was over on Ashby Street where the West End Performing Arts Center [Atlanta, Georgia] is.  That used to be the West End library.  There was nothing, so we were isolated there with that house.  So there was no parking lot, there was just the house.  So but now this is a county owned building.  So all the renovations that you can get done, the county can do them.  And the county has, was doing art centers around the county.  And so there was, you know a lot of political shenanigans about what to do over here in the West End [Atlanta, Georgia], playing off, the commissioners were batting it back and forth because they got to play the, you know, horse trading game to get anything done.  So we now over there we have a nice garden in the back with, with paved patio, tiered patio.  We have a parking lot on the side.  We redid the front of the place.  Instead of having two entrances up from the sidewalk to come from the curb up to the steps, you know have a straight up, set of steps coming straight up into the building.  So all that was done under my watch.  But it was working through the county to get it done.  It's not from funds that I raised per se.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So anyway then we, for us getting the place ready, we had to set, we had to make offices in there so with telephones and stuff like that.  The flooring is just finally getting done, but the floors were, the floors were terrible in there for a long time, weak, old.  Place had to be re- you know re-shored up.
Speaker 1: So this was all started in what year?  This was in eighty--
Speaker 2: Yeah, '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight [1988].
Speaker 2: Actually '87 [1987].  The place, we opened it in '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-seven [1987], we opened in 1988.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so tell me since that time some of the things that have occurred there.
Speaker 2: Well five hundred exhibits, I don't know.
Speaker 1: A lot of them.
Speaker 2: We opened the place up for rentals, for weddings, for receptions.
Speaker 1: Just a lot of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right (laughter).  You'll think of it as it comes.
Story_ID: 623488
Speaker 1: So let's talk about some other things then, that you're involved in, you know from the '80s [1980s] up until now.  I know there's, well let me ask you about the Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller] family, about that estate.  What, what happens with that?  You want to tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Well after Hoyt died--
Speaker 1: Tell me who Hoyt Fuller was.
Speaker 2: Everybody in Chicago [Illinois] 'ought to know who Hoyt Fuller was if they're over forty years old.  Hoyt Fuller (laughter) was a, he worked for Ebony magazine and was a editor of Negro Digest, then it became Black World.  Hoyt Fuller was very active in Chicago, well he was from Detroit [Michigan], but active in Chicago with something called OBAC, the Organization of Black and African Culture [sic. Organization of Black American Culture].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was as, he was internationally known for his involvement with, with writers from all over the world.  He was a teacher.  When he, when he, when Johnson [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] decided to cut the magazine, Hoyt moved back to, moved to Atlanta [Georgia], his family here, he had family here.  And, and his- he died suddenly.  He had started a magazine called First World here in Atlanta.  And I think he had about four issues of that before he died.  Hoyt had, I don't know, maybe two thousand books or more in his house.  And all his papers and stuff.  So at the time when I first moved here, the first year I was living in a, I found, I had an apartment in Little Five Points [Atlanta, Georgia].  And through a mutual friend to find out that Hoyt's place was going to be for rent.  So long story short, his, his aunt rented the place to me and then they became aware of my involvement in arts and my involvement with Hoyt because Hoyt was also involved in that festival [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria] that I worked on.  So you know, they asked me to help them with the estate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you take care of that and--
Speaker 2: Well not just me, actually [HistoryMaker] Richard Long also advised them on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Julie Hunter, not the one I saw in your book, but another Julie Hunter was head of the library at the time and of course Richard Long was at Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] for years before then, before he went to Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So he helped facilitate it.
Story_ID: 623489
Speaker 1: So now tell me about you at Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia]. What year was that?  You, you teach at Spelman?
Speaker 2: Never taught at Spelman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At all.  You know I was around the art department because first of all I know everybody over there.  But I curated faculty exhibition for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then tell me a little bit about the Regional Black Arts Directory.
Speaker 2: The Regional Black Arts--
Speaker 1: Okay that's something that you're just listed in.  You don't edit that, okay.  Tell me what happens next in your life.
Speaker 2: What happens next, I retire from Hammonds House [Hammonds House Museum, Atlanta, Georgia] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You retire in what year?
Speaker 2: Two o-two [2002].
Speaker 1: Okay now between that time and 2002, is there anything else that you were involved in?  I mean I'm sure there are plenty of things.  Can you think of things that you would like to talk about?  You have some--
Speaker 2: Well I got married in '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a son in '90 [1990].
Speaker 1: Who did you marry in '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: Margaret Counts-Spriggs, well I made her a Spriggs.  She hyphenated my name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And are you doing some writing or some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She's a professor at Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: She's a professor in the social work department at Clark Atlanta University.
Speaker 1: And you say you have another child?
Speaker 2: Abiose Spriggs.  He's a son.  He's at Wooster College [College of Wooster] in Ohio [Wooster, Ohio] at the moment.
Speaker 1: Okay so are you writing, are you producing artwork, what's going on now?
Speaker 2: I'm giving you this pause because I actually have another child, yes, named Ifakemi Spriggs.  Born in Nigeria but conceived in New York [New York].  So she's Nigerian mother and she lives in Atlanta [Georgia] now, we brought her here.  But she's like thirty-one.
Story_ID: 623490
Speaker 1: Okay so now talk to me about your, your freelance work.
Speaker 2: Freelance work, I've been doing--
Speaker 1: Curating.
Speaker 2: --freelance curating for a while.  In fact in my retirement, I'm trying to do things that, at my own pace so I don't have to work for anybody per se, don't have to punch a clock, et cetera.  Can utilize the skills that I have from over the years, and can be of service of similar kind.  So I, I've freelanced doing, curating exhibitions.  That's where the Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] thing came in.  I guess someone thought I was doing, teaching.  But that was a, that was a curatorial freelancer.  Then I've done work in New Jersey, at the Jersey City Museum [Jersey City, New Jersey] and I've worked, curated an exhibition at the Southwest Arts Center here in Atlanta [Georgia] of a collector's work, five collectors here in the area.  Yeah what else.  So basically my freelance work is, is, is the area of curatorial work has been in museums although I worked with a couple of artists over the years, one local artist, Radcliffe Bailey and one artist out of Baltimore [Maryland], Valerie Maynard.
Speaker 1: The art of Ben Jones, was that the exhibition in New Jersey museum?
Speaker 2: That was the Jersey City Museum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And with those, you know, there's always writing that goes with those, so it's a combination of curatorial and writing.
Story_ID: 623491
Speaker 1: What was your relationship like with Ben Jones?
Speaker 2: Goes back to Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York].  I exhibited Ben Jones like in 1970, yeah and we have had various, yeah various relationships.  He, he's a person that goes to Cuba a lot and I, I went to Cuba the first time under his guidance so to speak.  He doesn't take tours, but he helps you understand how to get to do what you've got to do.  And while people were saying you can't go to Cuba, you could go to Cuba.  And go there legitimately, legally I should say.  And so I've done that twice.  And each time was to go to an art exhibit, to have their, every other, well it's supposed to be every other year they do their biennial there and it's huge, and it's wonderful, and it's a chance to see not only Latin American art, but art from a lot of third world countries as well as from European countries.  So it's an educational thing as well as you know, an opportunity to expand your, you know understanding of, of Latin American and Cuban art, and to see Cuba, another wonderful place, wonderful people.
Speaker 1: When was the first time that you traveled there?
Speaker 2: That was the first time.  The second time was two years later, '05 [2005].
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: O-five [2005], '02 [2002], '02 [2002] and '05 [2005].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, '03 [2003] and '05 [2005], sorry.
Speaker 1: And how do you legally go to Cuba?  Tell me the secret.
Speaker 2: There's no secret.  You can go.  You can go.  What you don't know is all you have to be is a, somebody in education or somebody in, some aspect of culture and you can legitimately go.  Go through a travel agent.  There's a couple of travel agents that deal with travel to Cuba.  And, and they can set up, they you know you, you get your license, so to speak, through them.  They will set it up for you (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 623492
Speaker 1: Okay, and you also honor your friend Roy in 2009, is that right?
Speaker 2: I did what?
Speaker 1: Honored your friend Roy.
Speaker 2: Honored my, Roy DeCarava died and so I, I guess I wrote an obituary, not obituary, but wrote a piece.  Is that what you're referring to?  Yeah, so the answer is yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: I thought maybe that you, you showed his, his artwork in a museum or at an exhibition somewhere.  I was just asking.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Because I see that he, he died and, and that was something that you did.  What other travels have you done besides Africa and Cuba?
Speaker 2: I've gone to Guyana, South America and five European countries, visited on fellowship with the Museum of, Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York, New York].  Sweden, Germany, England. Sweden, Germany, England, I'm not gonna remember the other two, not that impressive.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) France, France.  How can you forget France?
Speaker 1: Are there any other relationships with other artists that you wanted to talk about?
Speaker 2: Relationships with other artists.  Well just, just that I've always tried to have a, use whatever I'm doing to support artists in some way, whether it's an individual artist or it's a group of artists.  While at Hammonds House [Hammonds House Museum, Atlanta, Georgia] for instance, the man that was my facilities person was advised by his doctor that he needed to quit work.  He's now deceased, but he did quit and brought in an artist fresh out of, fresh out of art school named Kevin Sipp that started working with him in terms of curatorial work and he's an artist, but he's also a great thinker and a good talker.  So he has become curator now, the curator at Hammonds House.  Not the director, but the curator.  And he's been doing a fantastic job, so I'm proud of that as a piece of my legacy so to speak, passing something on like that.  I've over the years you know, I've had, I've got relationships with artists from Trinidad, to various points in this country, Nigeria.  Just in terms of being accessible to them for information, advice when they asked, that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 623493
Speaker 1: What about some of the local artists, you know like [HistoryMaker] Brenda Singletary or [HistoryMaker] Kevin Cole, Flora Hammond.
Speaker 2: Flora Hammond died.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm just saying some of these local artists here in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: What about them?
Speaker 1: Have you ever done anything with the local artists?  I mean they, with them all coming together to do something?
Speaker 2: Only programs that are edu- are informational programs created and run at Hammonds House [Hammonds House Museum, Atlanta, Georgia] that would, that would give the artist information they would not otherwise have.  But I haven't exhibited them personally, Kevin has.  I think he did Flora.  I'm not sure if he did Singletary or not, but he might have.  My program was a little different from what Kevin is--he's more into the local artists.
Speaker 1: Okay now you say that you, you're an art appraiser at this time, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell, tell me a little bit about that.  Who, who's art, who are you appraising for?
Speaker 2: I'm appraising for collectors, I'm appraising for institutions.  Appraisers research the value for art.  They don't pull it out of the sky like they do, like you see them doing on 'Antique Roadway' [sic. 'Antiques Roadshow']. That's bologna.  Those people have already researched and studied that, whatever they're looking at.  And the research of artwork takes, you know, it's a minute.  Like you might spend three hours on one piece just to get, just to get the information you need to, to estimate a, to arrive at an estimate-- a value.  And to do that you might have to contact galleries, you might have to deal with auction prices, which is another research, you have to keep up with the literature on, on auctions and things like that.  Go on the Internet, go to auctions, go to galleries.  And you, there's a certain--there's a certain format, so to speak, that it takes to, you should write it up in.  There's, there's something called a Getty Institute identification format that is used, that's universal now because it's the same information that you would expect to, you expect INTERPOL [International Criminal Police Organization] or somebody like that to utilize to find out about a work.  So the format you use in putting together information on a piece is, follows that.  And then there's something called USPAP, the Uniform Standard Professional Appraisal Practices [sic. Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice] (laughter).  Which is another industry accepted format for creating, for writing up, for writing the proposals and for information about what it should be in the proposal, appraisal.  And so those things are industry wide accepted.  And anything that doesn't fit that, it's not a good appraisal.  And anybody that's a collector should know those things, and anybody that is a, a dealer or whatever should know those things.  But in order to do an appraisal for somebody who wants to donate their work to a museum, then you've got to deal with what the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] wants because they'll kick it back and you won't get your deduction.  So you've got to go through a certain way on that.  So it's not getting stuff off the top of your head, which is what most people think it is.  Because people will say, "Oh, can you give me an idea of what this is about?"  Well no, but I might be able to tell you a range, you know, that's like, like that.  I can't do you like this because it changes all the time.  The marketplace is in flux and you know, today a Bearden [Romare Bearden] is thirty-five thousand dollars.  Tomorrow it might be fifty, but it also might reflect what region it's coming, being promoted in, whatever.  So it's a lot of variables that go on that an appraisal has to take into consideration at a given time when that appraisal is being done.
Story_ID: 623494
Speaker 1: There are three major appraisal associations.  The American association, American appraisal association, international appraisal association [International Society of Appraisers], and the Appraisal Association of America [sic. Appraisers Association of America] (laughter), which basically do have courses.  These are associations that provide their members with information and, and you know produce, when they're, what any association does, it creates opportunities for members to, to interface with each other, to learn from each other and to get certain educational information.  And each of them do some kind of educational thing with universities.  I went to the University of Georgia in Athens [Georgia], to their certificate program they had in relation, with the American Society of Appraisers.  And after which, you know they test you and all that, and after which you, there's this USPAP [Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice] test that you have to do too.  So I have a certificate from both of those.  But it's a constant reading and keeping up with some of the things around IRS [Internal Revenue Service] and practices in the field.  So, but you know appraising is really based on a lot of your experience.  I mean you've got to know what you're looking at a lot and you've got to, even though fine art is, it comes under personal property appraisal.  I don't do people's houses and people's, you know people get their houses appraised or the content of their houses appraised.  I'm not into that.  I don't want to look in your closet, you know, your drawers.  I want to look at your art, that's what I do.  That's what my background prepares me better to do than the other thing.  So, but one thing I should tell you because it's another misunderstanding.  There's no licensing as such.  There's no government licensing in appraisal, you know.  It's not, it's almost, it's not like real estate in that way.  But they have to use the same USPAP standard for personal property appraisal as they do for art, or real estate I should say as they do for personal property appraisal.
Story_ID: 623495
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, would you change anything that you've done?  Would you do something differently?
Speaker 2: I'd probably do a lot differently when I look back over my life because I have a certain amount of knowledge with looking back.  But would I want to, want to have had a different life?  No, not necessarily.  I mean everybody wished they had more money to do something.  So I would say no to that.  There's nothing I would do differently.  I might go a little further on some things, and this might partially answer that question.  I mean I would, I would try to create a more patient outlook on life.
Speaker 1: Is there something that you haven't done that you want to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What would that be?
Speaker 2: Kind of related to what we're doing now, is finish a couple of books.  And I don't mean books of poetry, you know I'm almost, I almost don't even care about that per se.  But there's experiences that I had that I, and that (unclear) thing is one of them that need to be documented and you know as time goes by, there are few people left who had that eyewitness experience, and I'm one of them in certain instances.
Speaker 1: So what would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I tried (laughter).  That's it, that's all I want it to be is I tried.
