Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please.
Speaker 2: My full name as I was born was Usher Francis Ward.  Usher is spelled as usher in the church, U-S-H-E-R.  Francis is spelled F-R-A-N-C-I, as in idiot, S as in Sam.  And Ward is W-A-R-D.  I say "I" as in idiot because to this day, even though I've had this name for all of my sixty-nine years, people still spell my name as F-R-A-N-C-E-S.  Unfortunately, one of the perhaps things about having a name like Francis is that people mistake you for a woman.  So many people still think that everybody named Francis is a woman.  As a matter of fact, just the other day, I had to email a colleague of mine at the [S.I.] Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York] where I teach; I emailed this lady and corrected her on the spelling of my name.  I did it with tact and courtesy.  I don't get mad about it.  Sometimes when I get mail addressed to, intended for me addressed to Ms. Francis Ward, I amusingly read it, sometimes throw it away, sometimes I respond to the people and tell them that I hope you're not disappointed, but I'm a male and not a female.  Anyway, it's Usher Francis Ward.  I've used the name Francis professionally, since 1965, when I went to work with Jet magazine.  However, all of my friends in Atlanta [Georgia], where I grew up, still know me, know me as Usher Ward.  And my relatives, my sisters and brothers and my nieces still call me Uncle Usher or they still call me Usher, you know, by my first name.  I still use--it's still my name, only professionally, people know me as [HistoryMaker] Francis Ward and my business cards are printed as Francis Ward.  But I was born in Atlanta, Georgia on August 11th, 1935, at Grady Memorial Hospital [Atlanta, Georgia].  I am the sixth, or I was, I guess, the sixth of seven children of Effie Elizabeth Crawford Ward and Jefferson Sigmund Ward, Sr.  All of us were born in Atlanta, and I only have an older brother who lives in Atlanta today, and one of my nieces, but all of the rest of us live outside of Atlanta now.  Two of my oldest siblings are now--well, two of my siblings, one older sibling and one younger one are now deceased.  There are living today, my two oldest sisters, Doris Ward and Rose Ward and an older brother, Calvin Edward Ward, who lives in Willingboro, New Jersey; the sisters both live in New York City [New York, New York], one in Queens [New York, New York] and one in the Bronx [New York, New York].  And an older brother, Joel Ward, still lives in Atlanta.  A niece of mine, Francine Ward [ph.], lives in Mill Valley, California.  Another niece, Michelle Ward [ph.], still lives in Atlanta.  And we regularly correspond.  We talk to each other fairly often and we still keep in touch.  I also have a sister, Dorothy Ambrose [ph.] who lives in Chicago [Illinois].  And as I said, we're still a fairly, fairly closely--close-knit family and we correspond fairly often and we stay in touch with each other.
Story_ID: 227767
Speaker 1: You were listing your relatives and--
Speaker 2: As I had said previously, I am the sixth of seven children and of the seven, two are now deceased, and five of us remain.  I live in Syracuse, New York, and I teach at Syracuse University at the [S.I.] Newhouse School of Public Communications.  An older brother, Calvin Edward Ward, lives in Willingboro, New Jersey and he's a retired teacher and organist, although he still plays part-time for one of the churches in Willingboro.  My sister, Doris Ward, is a retired nurse, she lives in Queens, New York [New York].  My youngest sister, Rose Ward, is a retired librarian and she lives in the Bronx, New York [New York].  And an older brother, Joel Ward, lives in Atlanta [Georgia] and he is--was formally self-employed in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is Friday, September 17th, 2004.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are doing this taping at my sister's home at 111-12 198th Street in Queens, New York.

Speaker 1: Now, before we get into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that I'm compelled to ask and--
Speaker 2: It's all right.
Speaker 1: --they only require a short answer.  The first one is, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food is black-eyed peas and macaroni.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere where it's warm year-round; warm year-round with a pleasant climate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't believe I do, no.
Story_ID: 227769
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Effie, E-F-F-I-E, Elizabeth Crawford and the married name was Ward, W-A-R-D.  She was born in a little town called Social Circle, Georgia and I don't really know how close that is or was to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what year was she born?
Speaker 2: I don't know her birth year.  Well, she died in 1983, and my best estimate is that she was eighty-three years old when she died, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --I assume she was born in the year 1900.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, what do you know about your ancestors on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: I don't know a lot about them, and I guess I'm a little embarrassed to say that I don't know a great deal about my ancestors on my mother's side.  I don't know a great deal about those on my father's side either.  I know he was born in a--in Eatonton, E-A-T-O-N-T-O-N, Eatonton, Georgia, and I don't know--
Speaker 1: Can you give us his first name?  I mean--
Speaker 2: His first--
Speaker 1: --I mean, his--
Speaker 2: His full--
Speaker 1: --full name, yeah, full.
Speaker 2: His full name was Jefferson Sigmund, S-I-G-M-U-N-D, last name Ward.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And about what year was he born?
Speaker 2: Well, he was eighty-eight years old when he died in 1981, so his birth year, I think, would've been 1893.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was born in Eatonton?
Speaker 2: Eatonton.  E-A-T-O-N-O-N--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --E-A-T-O-N-T-O-N, I believe.  Eatonton.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so you don't know much about the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: No, or my father's side, no.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that go back to slavery or Reconstruction or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Well, I do remember my mother saying oh, at one time, that her mother was a member of the Igbo tribe, I believe, and she had come from Nigeria.  My father, I do remember some of his brothers in Atlanta, because we had a lot of cousins, and I'm trying to remember the names.  There were three or four brothers he had and all of them lived in Atlanta.  We got to know them fair--fairly well, but in terms of where they were born or what year they were born, I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: So no stories that go back to the 19th century and what life was like then?
Speaker 2: None that I can recall, at the time, no.
Story_ID: 227770
Speaker 1: Were they [Ward's paternal family] living on a farm in Eatonton [Georgia] when they lived in Eatonton or were they--
Speaker 2: Well, I remember dad [Jefferson Ward] talked about growing up on a farm because he had, I remember for a time in Atlanta [Georgia], he had--he raised--he had a, had a, a hog at a couple of times.  You know, he didn't raise like, I--it would've been incorrect to say he had a pig farm, but at one time, he had a pig and then I think when the pig got slaughtered later on, you know, he had another pig.  I do remember one very funny story about that and this goes back to maybe the--probably, the late 1940s, like 1945 or '46 [1946], where dad had this hog and it--it was the day the hog was supposed to be killed and, of course, for the, for the men who knew how to do this, they were supposed to know how to kill the hog and then to cut the hog up and process the meat so that eventually, you could eat it.
Speaker 1: Now, that was a big deal, right, in those days?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: A lot of people had to come and do it.
Speaker 2: It--yeah, it was.  What was supposed to happen was that somebody was supposed to hit the hog on this part of the hog's head, you know, right--and, and split its skull or something and that would be the first stage toward--I think the first thing you had to do, do to kill it.  Well, the hog apparently, understood this and the hog wouldn't stay still to be, to be hit, so the hog eventually got away and ran around the neighborhood.  So I remember all that morning these men were looking around the neighborhood trying to find this hog to kill it.  And I'm trying to remember, I think finally somebody did get it or finally, they held the hog still--well, either they hit him in the head or they had to kill it some other (unclear), but I think finally, they--the--they killed the hog.  But this, this was the most comical story for the whole--for weeks and weeks about how these men had chased a hog all around the--our neighborhood in Atlanta to get it and so that the hog would finally stand still so the, the hog could be killed.  And my recollection is that finally, after the hog was killed and processed, the processed--the--when the meat was supposedly processed, the processing went the wrong way and the meat got spoiled and we never ate any of it.  And I think this was something that my mother [Effie Crawford Ward], oh, she teased dad about for years, you know, about how the processing on the meat for this hog, you know, went wrong.  And, and, and we wound up after, after going to all this trouble of, of getting the hog, raising it, feeding it, and then, and then killing it, that the--we never--the, the family never got the benefit of any of the meat.
Speaker 1: So it was about 1946?
Speaker 2: That's my best recollection.  I know I was a very young boy at the time.
Story_ID: 227771
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't ask you when you, when you first gave me your name, but what's the significance of Usher, did they ever tell you?
Speaker 2: I don't know--oh, yes, I do know.  Yes, I do know.  Yeah.  I have an uncle Usher Crawford [ph.] who, who was born in Social Circle, Georgia also, and he spent most of his adult life in Los Angeles [California].  And the Usher I was named after, my Uncle Usher.  The Francis came from a nurse named Frances Murphy [ph.] who, I understand, helped to deliver me as a baby in 1935.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you know your grandparents on either side?
Speaker 2: I never got to know them very well, and I don't have much of a recollection about grandparents on either my mother's [Effie Crawford Ward] side or my father's [Jefferson Ward] side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Frances Murphy, was that--is that a man or--
Speaker 2: A woman.
Speaker 1: Woman?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--
Speaker 1: Still--
Speaker 2: --a woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, as you know, the, the female Frances is spelled F-R-A-N-C-E-S and the male Francis is spelled F-R-A-N-C-I-S.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Okay.  You know, there's a famous [HistoryMaker] Frances [L.] Murphy [II] that's related to the Murphys of the Afro-American Newspaper[s]?
Speaker 2: Not as far as I know, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But this is not one's that related?
Speaker 2: No, I think, I remember the Frances Murphy, she was the wife, I think, of the publisher of the Afro for a long-term, but no, this lady was--just had--it was just a coincidence of, of the same name.  This was not the same person; not the same Frances Murphy who was, who was related to the Afro family.
Speaker 1: It's kind of ironic thought, here you're a journalist and you're delivered by a Frances Murphy, but (laughter) okay.  So, so the grandparents on either side, we were talking about them; did you--
Speaker 2: I don't remember much about either one.  I don't even remember their names.  I remember seeing them when, when I was a very young child, but my recollection is that my grandmother on my mother's side died, died when I was maybe seven or eight years old, and I think the grandfather on my grand--on my father's side, he died, you know, around the same time.  So I was a very young child when they died and I don't remember much about either one.
Story_ID: 227772
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Effie Crawford Ward] or father [Jefferson Ward] have a chance to get much education in Atlanta [Georgia]?  Did they--were they able to go school?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was a dressmaker most of her adult life and she likes to be--she liked to be called a dressmaker, not a seamstress.  She finished Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] in, I believe the year was 1923.  My father did not finish college, he finished night school, but he--both of them believed very firmly in the value of education and it was because of their influence that I eventually went to college and went on to get a graduate degree in journalism.  And I credit both of them for guiding me the right way and instilling in me the value of education.  I remember when I finished Booker [T.] Washington High School [Atlanta, Georgia] in Atlanta in June of 1953, I just automatically assumed that I would go to college.  I thought everybody was going to go to college.  I mean, I thought that was something that every high school graduate would do.  I mean, I never thought about anything else.  I thought it was the norm.  I later found out, of course, that a lot of my classmates in that high school class of 1953, did not go to college.  And I remember a conversation I had with a young man who played football on the high school football team, and I just remember a conversation with him when I asked him what college he was going to go to and he told me he wasn't going to go to any college, and he would only go if the college came to him, which, which was another way of saying, "No, I'm not."  So, I thought it was kind of strange, but for me, every high school graduate, you know, should've gone to college and, and I never thought about doing anything else.  It never, never occurred to me that I would not go to college.
Story_ID: 227773
Speaker 1: Can you describe your mother's [Effie Crawford Ward] personality to us and your father's [Jefferson Ward] personality?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Mother and father were married in 1921.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind their, their--how they met?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  Now that I know of.  One of my oldest siblings might be--might know some stories about how, how they met.  At any rate, mother was very good at what she did.  She was a very good dressmaker.  She used to make clothes for a lot of people, African American and white.  And for a long period of time during the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s], she made dresses that were bought by one of the big department stores in Atlanta [Georgia] called Rich's; it was spelled R-I-C-H-apostrophe-s.
Speaker 1: That's the big one, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Rich's.
Speaker 2: It was one of the big--still is today, one of the big department stores in Atlanta.  She and dad attended separate churches.  She was a Baptist and she attended the Friendship Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], which is one of the oldest African American churches in Atlanta, and it was the church where I attended when I lived in Atlanta.  My father attended Zion Hill Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], and I think the reason why they attended was because Friendship Church, at that time, its services were staid, sedate, quiet, people didn't answer the pastor back, and it was known as a bourgeois--black bourgeois church.  Zion Hill was more traditional in the African American church services.  You know, people answer the pastor back, people shouted in the church, people showed their emotions willingly; I think dad preferred that kind of church service to the very sedate and quiet service that went on at that time in Friendship Church.  I think today if you attended Friendship Church, service would be much different.  You know, I think people do answer back--answer the pastor back now, but then in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] when I attended, it was not the right thing to do to answer the pastor back.  And I remember, if I can tell one story--one other story about Friendship Church, one of the things I recall about it was that the music--
Story_ID: 227774
Speaker 1: Oh, I asked you off camera like, what neighborhood you grew up in and you were telling us.
Speaker 2: In Atlanta [Georgia], I don't remember this area having a particular name.  I know the--our address in Atlanta in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] was 990 Lena, L-E-N-A Street; it was northwest Atlanta.  It wasn't--at the--it was maybe two, three miles from downtown Atlanta and the best landmark I can give for people who are not familiar with Atlanta then or now, is that it was close to Washington Park [Atlanta, Georgia] and it was around the corner from Booker T. Washington High School [Atlanta, Georgia] where I grew up.  I mean, I was within walking distance; I mean, I walked to high school.  The elementary school that I attended in Atlanta was called E.R. Carter [Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], E for Edward, R for Randolph, Carter, C-A-R-T-E-R.  And that elementary school was on the corner of Lena and Ashby, A-S-H-B-Y; Ashby Street northwest.  And it was down the street from my house so I could walk to elementary school and then also, I could walk to high school.  This area on Lena Street was a typical, at least typical for me, homeowner area.  It was all black at the time; no whites lived there, although I suppose if a white person wanted to live there, he or she, you know, would've been welcomed.  I don't think that there would've been any objection.  Though, of course, when I grew up in Atlanta, you know, we didn't have integrated neighborhoods; the whites lived in one neighborhood and blacks lived in there.  But this was a very stable homeowner community where people obeyed all of the traditional American values.  You know, they owned their own homes, they were very thrifty, they, they all worked, they all had savings accounts, and everybody, you know, lived, you know, what was regarded as the American dream at the time.
Story_ID: 227775
Speaker 1: I have some memories of attending elementary school, E.R. Carter Elementary School [Atlanta, Georgia].  I do recall when I was nine years old on D-Day [June 6, 1944], that is on the American invasion of the European continent during World War II [WWII] that was a day in the memory of a lot of people.  I do recall when I was nine years old, there was a [American] Red Cross nurse who came to my house and a conversation this nurse had at--with my mother [Effie Crawford Ward].  I think that was my first understanding of what D-Day or the European invasion meant at the time.  I recall going to element--elementary school.  I recall some of the teachers I had in elementary school.  And I also recall taking part oh, in one year or another, in the pageants we had every year that we called Negro History Month pageants or Negro History Week [Black History Month].
Speaker 2: Right, that's--
Speaker 1: Negro History Week was, of course, we celebrated by doing little skits based on the life of Joe Louis or George Washington Carver or, let me see who else, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], of course, you know, he wasn't around at the time, so it was Joe Louis, George Washington Carver, Marian Anderson, and I think Harriet Tubman.  And I--I don't remember anybody whom, whom I impersonated, but it might've been George Washington Carver, but I don't know.  But I do remember some of the elementary school kids, you know, would wear a little costume and, you know, impersonate the life and that was our first understanding of these, you know, Black History Month figures; of course, at that time, we called it Negro History Week and not Black History Month the way we do now.
Story_ID: 227776
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Effie Crawford Ward] was a very good cook and I remember I liked everything she cooked except fried fish.  And for some reason, and I don't even remember the exact reason why, but I never liked the fried fish that she cooked, but I liked everything else; all the vegetables, all the meats, all the baked dishes she cooked, I loved everything she, she cooked, but I never liked the fried fish.  I--my father [Jefferson Ward], I remember--I don't remember the year, but I remember a time when the National Baptist Convention was meeting in Atlanta [Georgia] and as was typical at that time, when people attended their convention, they would stay in the homes of individual people because hotels weren't as open to black people staying in them as the hotels are today.  At any rate, I do remember there were three women who were staying in our house attending the National Baptist Convention.  And I remember one Sunday morning when my father led the typical Sunday morning prayer morning, you know, which we--he, which, which he did with all of us children.  And these three women were a physical study in contrast.  One was very tall and very heavyset; another one was very thin, she probably didn't weight more than eighty pounds; and another one was short and fat, she weighed about three hundred pounds; I mean, you couldn't had--couldn't find three women who physically, were more of a contrast.  And I remember during this Sunday morning prayer meeting, these women got happy.  They got--they began to feel the spirit and all of them began to shout.  And I started to wonder, "Well, what was dad going to do?  Was he going to be able to control the situation or was this, this going to get out of hand?"  Well actually, he did.  They began to shout and get happy with him, so he began to exhort, you know, the name of the Lord and began to preach and he eventually found a way to calm all of them down and it all had a very happy ending.  But I can remember kind of having this feeling of trepidation and uncertainty about how was my dad going to control this, this situation?  But he did manage to do it.  I remember also my first introduction to politics came from my father.  When we lived on Lena Street, there was a grocer, this man's name was Murray Ford [ph.], African American, and he owned the little, oh, we'd call it a mom and pop store now, but you know, a little grocery store down the street from my house.  So Mr. Ford would come up to our house often and he and dad would sit around and talk politics.  And he and dad would often disagree, but I would kind of sit and listen to these disagreements.  I do remember oh, some arguments he and dad had about [President] Franklin [Delano] Roosevelt; I remember some arguments he and dad had about [President] Harry [S.] Truman, when Harry Truman was president, but that was my first introduction to and understanding of politics, you know, listening to conversations my father had with Mr. Ford, this grocer.  I--Mr. Ford also, he was a light fair skinned person and he often would talk about racial categories like being an octoroon or quadroon and that was my first understanding of that, you know, of what it meant, you know, to be, to be either part black or, or to have, you know, mixed ancestor and I think I--my first conversations about that came from Mr. Ford.  But I do re--I think today, I credit my father's discussion of politics.  I credit that more than anything else with giving me an early understanding of politics and an appreciation of politics, and I think at an early age, I began to follow politics and know what electoral politics were about.
Story_ID: 227777
Speaker 1: I do remember in 1948, at the Democratic National Convention [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], there was a big rhubarb, a big controversy that, that occurred there.  And I remember seeing this on television and knowing that about it and I was only thirteen years old, but I kind of understood what the whole controversy was about, based in large part on the conversations my father [Jefferson Ward] had had.  This was a controversy where some of the liberal Democrats from the North introduced a very mild civil rights plank into the Democratic Party platform and, of course, at that time, a major part of the Democratic Party were the white segregationist politicians who came from the South; well, the segregationists didn't like this civil rights plank.  By today's standards, this civil rights plank would be almost nothing, but back then, it was a big thing.  So this--a number of the southern delegations to the Democratic Convention walked out and I remember very prominently, the person who--well, who eventually became the leader of the southern Democrats and who became their presidential candidate was the late Strom Thurmond, James Strom Thurmond, who at that time, was the governor of South Carolina and who was a Democrat and who ran for president in 1948 on the Dixiecrat ticket.  Well, I remember following that and I had a, I think, a very good understanding of it for a thirteen year old.  But my understanding of the background to all of this and the civil rights fight within the Democratic Party came from the conversations I had with my father.
Story_ID: 227778
Speaker 1: Both mother [Effie Crawford Ward] and father [Jefferson Ward] were, were people who believed deeply in principle.  Who believed in, in standing up for what you believe.  She was a kind of no nonsense person who would speak her mind right away, if she didn't like something and dad was, was kind of the same person.  I remember, I think it was probably in the early fif--1950, 1951, before the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka] in 1954, when the parks were still segregated in Atlanta [Georgia], he took me to one of the parks near downtown Atlanta near what is, what is called Five Points in Atlanta.  That's like the heart of downtown Atlanta.  And this was a little square park, wasn't much to it, but it was reserved for, for, for only for whites.  So we went to this little park and we sat down.  Well, within seconds, you know, a crowd of hostile whites had surrounded us and told us we had to go, so dad told me to sit there.  Now, eventually, the police were called.  The police told us that if we didn't leave, then we would be arrested; well, then we, left.  He did that because he wanted to make a point to me, that if you believe deeply in something and if you resisted and if you, if you thought something was wrong, you should be willing to take a stand against it.  Now, we weren't willing to get arrested.  We weren't, we weren't going to engage in any physical fight with this mob of white people, but he did that to show me that there are things worth fighting for, there are things worth taking a stand for, and I think that has shaped me into the kind of person that I am today; that if you believe deeply in something, you should be willing to take a stand for it, even some things you should be willing to die for.
Story_ID: 227779
Speaker 1: Okay, so, in--when you were thirteen in 1948, you were really paying attention to politics then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had a very--well, not a huge, but a--certainly, a very good understanding of politics at that age, and I think much better than most thirteen year olds.  I started reading the newspaper fairly early.
Speaker 1: Which ones would you read?
Speaker 2: Well, the newspapers we read at that time were The Atlanta--there were two daily newspapers at that time, The Atlanta Constitution [The Atlanta Journal-Constitution], which was the morning paper, and The Atlanta Journal [The Atlanta Journal-Constitution], which was the afternoon paper.  And then there was, there was the Atlanta Daily World, which printed daily at that time, and it was, was then and still is today, one of the few daily newspapers owned and operated by African Americans.  The Atlanta World printed, I think, only five days a week; it wasn't seven days a week, but it was still considered a daily paper, but we read, read both.  We read the morning Constitution.  Didn't read the Journal.  We didn't, we didn't subscribe to the Journal so much, but we read the morning Constitution and we also read the Atlanta World.  I do remember that my older brother, Joel Ward and I, for oh, a couple years, delivered the newspaper.  We were delivery boys and we delivered the morning Atlanta Constitution to people's homes.  I remember having--getting up--having to get up early in the morning and go pick up the newspapers and deliver them to people's houses.  I also remember that at a very early age, maybe, maybe around fifteen, as--certainly, as a teenager, I wanted to be a newspaper reporter.  And I don't know even today what influenced 'cause my, my parents [Effie Crawford Ward and Jefferson Ward] didn't shape me to do it.  They didn't--my mother wanted me to be a minister, my father wanted me to be a medical doctor, but I wanted to be a newspaper reporter, and I don't know quite what it was, I don't remember, but I always remember that's what I wanted to do, I wanted to be a newspaper reporter.  And at the time, of course, the opportunities for blacks as reporters, or to go into journalism were very limited.  You either had to work for one of the black weekly papers or you had to work for a black publication like CP magazine or Ebony magazine, but that didn't deter me, you know.  I had this feeling that I wanted to be a newspaper reporter and I never really gave serious consideration to anything else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't want to be a teacher.  The most college--most black college graduates at that time, either went into teaching or they would go into social work.  A smaller number of them, you know, aspired to be doctors, and I eventually went to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] and I think Morehouse College had a pretty good reputation at that time, of graduating men who eventually became doctors.

Speaker 1: Tell us about grade school [E.R. Carter Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] and high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What, what were your favorite subjects in grade school?  Were you then like concentrating on writing or--
Speaker 2: I don't know if I had a favorite subject at all, either in grade school or in high school.  I was a good student.  I was, I was smart.  I was very good in spelling.  And I was known in elementary school and in high school as a good student, you know, a kid, you know, who was smart.  I don't think I was stuck up, but I don't think any of the members of my family were stuck up or, or else had the reputation of being, being stuck up, you know, but, you know, I was known as a kid who was smart.  And my brother, Joel [Ward], who was a year older than I was, he was known as a very sharp dresser and he was the one who was most attracted, you know, to the girls.  I remember being a good student, both in elementary school and making good grades in elementary school and in high school.  And I remember in high school, I worked on the high school newspaper.  I was the editor of the high school yearbook.  And I was secretary of my senior class.  And I was known as someone, you know, who took a leadership position in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And in what regard?
Speaker 2: Well, I was secretary of the senior class and I was one who was looked to, you know, or who was probably asked when either the principal of the school or one of the teachers, you know, wanted a smart kid to do something, I would be one of those whom they would single out.
Story_ID: 227781
Speaker 1: Oh also, when I was in high school for maybe three years, I kept score for the high school baseball team.  I learned how to keep statistics for the baseball team, you know, hits, runs, errors, batting averages and things like that.  And I think that probably was one of the reasons why I wanted to go into journalism because I had a liking for keeping statistics and doing bookwork, doing dull things that other kids probably wouldn't want to do.  And I think that was one of the things that early on kind of influenced me to go into journalism.  When I attended Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] for four years, I also kept score for the Morehouse College baseball team.  The team was not that good, but that's all right, that's another story; the high school baseball team was good.  And let me see, I'm--there was at least one player on the baseball team at that time, a man by the name of Leon Jamison, who--well, he was good enough to at least have a tryout with the Chicago Cardinals [Arizona Cardinals] football team, and I think this guy, Jamison, could've played major league baseball had he, had he opted.  He was a good baseball and football player, but he opted for a career in football and he, he--I remember he had a tryout with the NFL [National Football League] team at that time, known as the Chicago Cardinals, which later became the St. Louis Cardinals, which are now the Arizona Cardinals, okay?  That same franchise.  He had a tryout with that and he may have played for them for a brief period of time.  I was always convinced that Leon Jamison could've played major league baseball had he stayed and, and had he tried for baseball in--instead of football, but apparently, football was a favorite sport.  I think later on he got injured and his football career, you know, whatever it was, was cut short.  Anyway, I remember he probably was the best baseball player, you know, on the team that I kept score for at Booker [T.] Washington High School [Atlanta, Georgia].  But I had developed a love of sports early on, you know, the traditional sports, baseball, football, basketball; I like track a lot.  As a kid, I contracted polio in my right leg and polio was a very dreaded disease at the time.  But it left my right leg smaller than my left leg and for a period of time, I had to wear a brace on my right leg and it left me with a limp.  Today, I still walk with a limp because the right leg is shorter than the left leg.  But I would play all--I mean, on the playground I played football and baseball with all the other kids.  And I never played high school sports because I was too skinny and also, because of this--because of my polio, but I did follow sports a lot.  And my earliest liking for sports came from my experiences, you know, both, you know, as a high school kid and also because of my work, you know, with the high school baseball team.
Story_ID: 227782
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers or coaches or any adults other than your parents [Effie Crawford Ward and Jefferson Ward], you know, that--were any of them like role models for you or mentors?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The man who coached the baseball team, a man by the name of Claude [Clarence "Red"] George [Jr.], who died, I think, maybe last year or--last year or the year before in Atlanta [Georgia].  Claude George was definitely an influence on me.  He was the high school baseball coach and I remember him urging me, encouraging me, you know, to become a journalist because I'm a good writer.  I remember him urging and encouraging me to be the best that I--that I could in--as a, as a statistician, as a, a person who likes sport and as one who should go to college and become the best college, college student that I could, so I remember him as an influence on me.  Also, I remember about five or six years ago maybe, at that time, Claude George lived in New Jersey with his wife and he organized a reunion of a lot of the people who were high school classmates who had attended Booker [T.] Washington High School [Atlanta, Georgia] and who were on the baseball team that he, that he coached.  And we had a reunion at his house and one of the people who attended this reunion was man named Donn Clendenon, who had played major league baseball.  Donn Clendenon was a very good athlete in high school, he was also a very good athlete, baseball, football and basketball at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  And Clendenon eventually played major league baseball with the New York Mets and for a couple years, he also played NFL [National Football League] football with the Cleveland Browns.  And Donn Clendenon attended this reunion at Claude George's house in New Jersey and we had a good conversation.  We were recalling some old stories and things that had happened years ago, you know, when both of us were in high school and both of us, you know, attended the same college at about the same time.
Speaker 1: Now, Clendenon, he was like the hero of the Met team, the '69 [1969] Mets that won the World Series (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  When they won the--
Speaker 1: --that came out of--
Speaker 2: --World Series, yes.
Speaker 1: --nowhere and broke the hearts of the [Chicago] Cubs in Chicago [Illinois].  Right.
Speaker 2: I remember, yeah.
Speaker 1: Donn Clendenon, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had quite a career with the Mets, yes, and later with the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Story_ID: 227783
Speaker 1: Now, so you always knew you were going to go college and already had kind of a career picked out for yourself; did--how did you choose Atlanta [Georgia]?  It was right there in Atlanta, but--
Speaker 2: Well, my first college was not Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  My first semester in college, I attended Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went there in 1953, because that was the only historically black college [HBCU] I knew of that had a program in journalism.  Now, I went to Lincoln on scholarship and, of course, one should know that attending college in 1953 was a whole lot different than attending college today; it cost a whole lot less then than it, than it does today.  My family didn't have a much money and so my father [Jefferson Ward] let me know that there wasn't much money available.  So my older brother had finished college, at that time, my older brother, brother, Calvin Edward Ward had finished and he loaned me a little money, you know, to attend Lincoln University in Missouri.  But also, my of my expenses there were paid from a scholarship that I had from the State of Georgia, based upon my being--it was a scholarship giving--given to handicapped students.  And I don't remember the money, money amount that it was worth, but it was enough to kind of get me through at least for one semester at Lincoln.  But when I got to Lincoln, I found out that I wouldn't be taking the journalism courses right away, that I would be taking the liberal arts courses for both the freshman and sophomore year, and I wouldn't begin to take the journalism courses for--until my junior year.  Well, given that situation and given the fact that yeah, I really didn't have enough money to remain there, I decided after spending my first semester in the fall of 1953 at Lincoln, that I would transfer back and I would attend Morehouse in Atlanta, which was my hometown.  Well, the experience at Lincoln cost, cost me some credits because I wasn't able to transfer all of my credits from Lincoln University to Morehouse.  I entered Morehouse in February of 1954, but I wound up staying at Morehouse a little longer than I ordinarily--my--normally, if I had spent the whole four years, I would've graduated in 1957, but I wound up graduating from Morehouse in 1958.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I transferred back to--well, I came back to Atlanta and transferred into Morehouse in January of 1954, and I spent the rest of my college career there.  I was an English major and poli-sci, political science maj-- minor.
Story_ID: 227784
Speaker 1: Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] is legendary among the schools that educate--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --young black men and, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so talk something about these professors at Morehouse and some of the--
Speaker 2: I had a lot of good professors at Morehouse and one of, one of my professors, one whom I guess I remember the best was named Gladstone Louis Chandler.  He was the chair of the English department and he taught me many--most of the English classes that I had.  It was under Gladstone Louis Chandler that I learned most of the black history that I--that I knew at that time.  I never did--one of the things I didn't get much of either in elementary [E.R. Carter Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] or in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] growing up in Atlanta [Georgia] was an understanding of African American history or Negro history, as we called it at the time.  There wasn't--I didn't learn much Negro history in high school nor in elementary school, even though we had these little Negro history pageants in elementary school, but neither one of the teachers spent much time teaching Negro history to us as students.  I didn't begin to learn much about African American history until I got to college, that's when I learned the first about the Harlem Renaissance.  I didn't even know about the Harlem Renaissance until I got to college and then G. Louis Chandler taught us about the Harlem Renaissance and all of the famous people, you know, who were writers and artists during the Harlem Renaissance.  I didn't know about the career of Frederick Douglass until I took political science courses from the--my political science professor at Morehouse, a man named Robert [Hughes] Brisbane, B-R-I-S-B-A-N-E, who probably taught at Morehouse close to fifty years.  I think he just recently retired.  And he may still be alive.  He must be probably in his eighties or even in his nineties.  But he was my political science professor at Morehouse and he was the first one to teach me about Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Frances Harper, and a lot of the heroic figures of the 19th century, you know, in the anti-slavery movement.
Story_ID: 227785
Speaker 1: Gee, I mean, was there any specific things that you remember that you learned in that course of study that changed you, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my understanding and my appreciation of black history, you know, changed both from Robert [Hughes] Brisbane and from G. Louis Chandler [Gladstone Louis Chandler].  One of the things that I didn't learn about, which later on I developed an awareness of, was the career of the legendary W.E.B. Du Bois, who had been a professor and champion of civil rights at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  Well, when I was going to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], the--Du Bois' name was not mentioned that much and I think that was because of the [Joseph] McCarthy scare.  The anti-communist scare that many people had even, you know, people who taught at African American schools.  The name of Du Bois was hardly ever mentioned in any of my classes or any conversations that people would have and I am sure that the reason why it was not because during the 1950s, there was this fear that, you know, if you ran afoul of the red baiters or the communist hunters at that time, the House Un-American Activities Committee [HUAC], the Joe McCarthy committee that somehow, you know, you would get in--into some kind of trouble.  So I hardly--I didn't learn anything about Du Bois until after I finished Morehouse.  I also remember another experience I had, I think the year was 1957, during the red scare period when a subcommittee of the infamous House Un-American Activities Committee and for those who don't know, they should know what this was.  This was a committee of the [U.S.] House of Representatives which for decades, held hearings hunting communists everywhere they could find them and the HUAC, as we call it, H-U-A-C hearings and investigations helped to ruin a lot of people and scare a lot of people into silence.  At any rate, there was a subcommittee of this red baiting House Un-American Activities Committee that held a hearing in Atlanta [Georgia] and at this hearing, a man by the name of Carl Braden was called to testify.  The, the tradition of HUAC was to call people to testify to ask them were they then or had they ever been a member of the Communist Party and, of course, if the person denied, this individual could be cited for contempt of [U.S.] Congress and eventually, you know, could, could go to jail.  Well, Carl Braden was called to testify before this subcommittee of the House Un-American Activities Committee and I remember I went to the hearing, you know, as a young college student, I wanted, I wanted to see it, you know, I wanted to see what happened.  So I remember the give and take between Carl Braden and the committee members and after the hearing was over, I chatted with Carl Braden for a while and one of the things he--I told him I attended Morehouse College and so he said to me, "Oh, you know my good friend [G.] Murray Branch."  I said, "Yes, I do."  Murray Branch, at that time, was my professor of religion.  So I think maybe after that, maybe a week or so, after one of my classes with Professor Murray Branch, I just happened to mention to him, I said, "I ran into Carl Braden down at this hearing and he told me to give you his best regards," something like that.  And I remember Murray Branch blanched and he froze and I could tell, you know, he was scared.  And he said to me, "Did he say anything else to you?"  And he wanted to know about the conversation that had taken place between me and Carl Braden so I told him.  And I could tell him this--he was visibly shaken from this.  Well, I'm sure that occurred because my professor Murray Branch was afraid that Carl Braden probably had mentioned his name during his testimony or that somehow the House Un-American Activities Committee would find some association between him and Braden.  As far as I know, they never--the committee never called Murray Branch to testify and I don't know if there was any negative fallout from this, but I do recall very vividly, how scared Murray Branch was at the mention of Carl Braden knowing him and recalling Murray Branch as one of his good friends.
Speaker 1: We had some tough times.
Speaker 2: Very much.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Very much.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Story_ID: 227786
Speaker 1: That was all in the news.  Also, when you were in--at Atlanta [Georgia], Brown versus Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] case was the next thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I remember the Brown versus Board of Education case very well.  I remember May 7, 1954, growing up at--in Atlanta, I was nineteen years old at the time and one of the things I remember about it best was the--1954 was an election year for governor of Georgia and, of course, the white segregationists who ran politics in the southern states at that time, they were all Democrats, now all of those people are Republicans, okay, those who are still active, they, they would, of course, like Strom Thurmond would, would claim that they have now rejected their segregationist past and that they have a different view now; I don't always believe that from the southern politicians.  At any rate, there were nine white candidates for governor of Georgia at that time and I very vivid--vividly remember them, that all nine of them vowed that if they were elected governor, they would never, never allow segregation or desegregation to take place in any of the schools in the State of Georgia.  You know, a favorite phrase was, "I will die and rot in hell before a single nigra child goes to school with a single white child."  Now, of course, nigra was N-I-G-R-A; it was supposed to be the polite term for nigger.  You know, in polite circles, you know, if you didn't want to be thought of as a, as an out and out racist who said nigger, you would say nigra.  So polite Southern whites would say nigra, you know, of course, no good self-respecting Georgia cracker could ever be brought to use the word Negro so the polite white southerners would say nigra, spelled with a lowercase N-I-G-R-A.  So all of the candidates for governor at that time vowed that if they were elected, they would never allow racial integration to take place in a single school, you know, in Georgia.  I do remember that campaign and the man who eventually won for governor of Georgia was a man by the name of Marvin Griffin.  And my recollection about him was I think he served one term, maybe two terms as the governor of Georgia, but Marvin Griffin turned out to be arguably, the most corrupt politician, you know, in the history of Georgia politics.  I think he and his brother, a man named Cheney Griffin eventually went to, went to jail because of all of the thieving that they did.  But I remember the statements of resistance that were made by all of the southern politicians at the time.  I also remember the headlines in the newspapers, you know, "This is a Black Day for the South," black meaning bad, demonic.  Black then, to some extent, one would say that's even--it's even true today, was always associated with the negative.  It was always associated with what was bad, what was evil, what was regarded as forces related to, to the devil as opposed to white, which was always associated with angelic forces of good.  So the southern newspapers, all of them across the South, you know, regarded May 17, 1954, as a quote "black day" for the South because that was the day, you know, when the [U.S.] Supreme Court ruled, but I have very fresh recollections of that, you know, what happened then.
Story_ID: 227787
Speaker 1: Did you know Benjamin Mays?  I can't--
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Benjamin Mays was the president of Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] when I attended Morehouse and he was regarded as an outstanding educator, as, as a very substantial leader of--and a good education--good educator and he was also regarded as an outstanding minister.  He was trained as a minister and he was also a--he didn't pastor a church at the time, but he took what seemed to us to be a special interest in the ministry and in educating people to go into the ministry. Morehouse didn't have a school of religion, but it had classes to help ministers to, you know, improve their skills, to improve their learning and improve their knowledge of different liberal arts courses and Mays was very interested, interested in that.  He was vell--very well liked, very influential among the foundations and sources that gave money to historically black colleges [HBCUs].  And he's very well liked, very well respected, not only among other black college presidents, but among other people, you know, who were, you know, in higher, higher education at the time.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance--now I've heard that, that he would go to the cafeteria and stand on a table and give a extemporaneous speech from time to time.
Speaker 2: I don't recall doing that, of course, I didn't live on campus, you know, you know, I lived off campus at the time.  But I do remember our--we, when I was going to Morehouse from 1954 to 1958, we had to attend chapel first thing in the morning before our classes and the chapel was always at eight o'clock.  So Monday through Friday, I had to be on campus at eight o'clock and Mays was often a speaker at the morning chapel.  This was oh, lasted about half-an-hour, maybe forty minutes, and this was just prior to your first classes at Morehouse.  He was very frequently a speaker during the morning chapel service, but I don't recall ever seeing him, you know, in the dining room, although I don't doubt that that might have happened.
Speaker 1: You have any stories about him?
Speaker 2: No personal stories.  I never got to know him as a personal mentor or anything, or I never got to know him because of any personal relations he had with any member of my family, but I do remember him as the college president and I do remember him as one who had a very outstanding reputation at the time.
Story_ID: 227788
Speaker 1: Now, any, any other stories about Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] you want to tell us or--those days?
Speaker 2: Well, Morehouse was an all-male school and it was known, at that time, at least it liked to tout itself as the Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] of the South, meaning if you compared yourself to Harvard that it's--it meant that you were good academically.  Because Morehouse was all-male, it, it had a kind of special relationship with Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], which was kind of like across the street which was all female.  Now, these were two separate colleges that had two distinct histories, but the two sort of grew up as being a kind of brother and sister to each other.  Morehouse had the reputation at that time as being a college that had a high--a higher percentage of homosexuals than any other college; now, I don't think I did.  I mean, there were some students at Morehouse who, who were homosexual, but so, there were homosexuals everywhere, at every college.  But Morehouse was suspected of having a higher percentage only because, you know, it was all male.  I don't think that that ever--was ever true, but the reputation was out there.  But Morehouse also had a reputation for--and I think there was some justification for this, of nurturing people who were thought that they were superior to, to others, okay?  Now, I don't ever think I thought that way about students who went to other college, but I do know--other colleges I meant to say, but I do know students I attended Morehouse with who did think that, who thought that they were somehow superior to, academically, and intellectually, they were superior to others who attended other colleges, especially if you attended a state school.  I do know that there were some Morehouse graduates who thought--who looked down their noses at students who attended Morris Brown College, which was one of the private colleges in Atlanta [Georgia], if they attended Fort Valley State College [Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia], if they attended Savannah State [College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia], if you attended Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama] or Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  If you attended any of the state colleges, there was a feeling among some of the Morehouse graduates that if you attended one of those colleges, colleges, that you simply could not get as good, good an education as you would get if you attended Morehouse or Spelman; now, I never felt that way and I kind of rejected that superiority complex.  But I do remember that was a feeling that some of the Morehouse, I don't say everybody who finished Morehouse felt that way, but--
Speaker 1: I know I heard other people we've interviewed say that Dr. [Benjamin] Mays would come in and tell them say, "You're a Morehouse man and what that means--and that separates you from others."  I mean, it was--seemed like it was something that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I don't--
Speaker 1: --was kind of drilled.
Speaker 2: I don't know if Benjamin Mays was a champion of that view, but he was president at the time when, when that view--when a lot of people who went, went to Morehouse did believe that and I cannot say, based on my, my personal experience that I know that he encouraged that, but he may have, okay?  He may have encouraged people to think that or he may have helped to create an atmosphere at Morehouse, you know, which was conducive to Morehouse people thinking that they were better than or superior to students.  What I remember then and what I remember about this afterwards was that this feeling of Morehouse superiority never applied to any of the whites, it only applied to other blacks and blacks who attended states schools mostly.  As I said, there was a feeling of superiority also to those students who attended Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] , which was across the street and Morris Brown, but it didn't apply to the women who attended Spelman College.  Spelman was supposed to be the academic equal of Morehouse.  Now, I do know that back in the 19th century when some of the historically black colleges [HBCUs] were founded, including Morehouse and Spelman, some of the aristocratic whites who established these colleges, and some of them--some of the aristocratic whites who ran the colleges for, for a time after they had been founded, did tend to encourage the young negro children who attended the Morehouses and the Spelmans and the Bennett [College, Greensboro, North Carolina] colleges and the other private institutions to think that somehow, the fact that they were able to get an education made them better or that they should hold themselves apart from other African Americans, so I think this feeling of superiority probably dates back to the time when these colleges, Morehouse and Spelman included, were founded by the aristocratic whites, you know, mostly from the North.
Story_ID: 227789
Speaker 1: I guess one of the guilt feelings I have today was that I never contributed much money and my wife, [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward], keeps telling me that I have to do that, you know, and I think I agree with her.  That one of my goals in life in whatever years I have left on this earth is to make some regular contributions to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  I never became active with the Morehouse alumni clubs, you know, that were established in Chicago [Illinois] and even in New York [New York].  And I think the reason why, and this may be unfair, I think the reason why I didn't was because I still harbored some resentment from this old notion of Morehouse superiority and I didn't want to get involved with people, you know, who felt that way.  And I think, you know, in retrospect, it might've been unfair, might've been an unfair tarnishing of those people who were active 'cause I'm sure that there were a lot of good useful things I could've done for the college, you know, had I become active with the Morehouse alumni club in Chicago or in Washington, D.C. or New York.  But I never did and the main reason I can recall was because I harbored this resentment of, you know, the Morehouse--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --superiority complex.
Story_ID: 227790
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, you graduated from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] in '58 [1958]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you had a B.A. in--
Speaker 2: A B.A. in--a major in English and a minor in political science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you--did you get a job right away, or did you just go right onto graduate school?
Speaker 2: One of my most interesting stories that I like to tell.  When I finished Morehouse College in 1958, I was approaching my twenty-third birthday and I wanted to go to graduate school to get a graduate degree in journalism, but I first wanted to get a job to earn some money.  So I got a job at the Atlanta Daily World, which was located then and I think it's located today, at 145 Northeast--145 Auburn Avenue Northeast [Atlanta, Georgia].  I got a job at the Atlanta Daily World in 1958 as a janitor earning forty dollars a week and people will wonder why in the world would a college graduate take a job as a janitor?  Well, I didn't want a career as a janitor obviously, but what I wanted to do was to get my foot in the door.  At that time, if you wanted to go into journalism, if you wanted to be a reporter or a photographer, you didn't just walk in the door and say, "I want to be a reporter."  The tradition at that time was to start at the bottom; this was true with the white newspapers as well as with the black newspapers.  Of course, in 1958, black newspapers were not hiring any black reporters, photographers or anything else.  But my feeling was that I needed to get some experience to prepare myself both for graduate school and to eventually try to get a job in journalism after I had finished and I thought that if I had gotten some experience at a newspaper somewhere, I would become more marketable both with some experience and with a graduate degree in journalism, so that was kind of my game plan.  So the best way to gain some experience in journalism was to get a job at a paper, but the Atlanta Daily World wouldn't hire me as a reporter at the time, so to get a foot in the door, I took this job as a janitor at the Atlanta World making forty dollars a week, but my goal was to eventually get an opportunity to do some reporting.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So did you get that opportunity?  I would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: --I would suspect that that's, that's where the story's going.
Speaker 2: Well, well it is, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What happened was that I worked maybe five or six months as a janitor and then the proofreader at the paper got fired.  Proofreader--the proofreader job, at that time, was something very much akin to what a copy editor does today.  So I got promoted.  The editor and publisher and owner or the principal owner of the paper at that time was a man named C.A. Scott, C for Cornelius A. Scott, who was up in his nineties and who was still alive.  The Scott family still runs the Atlanta Daily World today, but C.A. Scott hired me first as janitor and later on, he promoted me as a proofreader after his--the other proofreader got fired.  Well anyway, I began--my job as a proofreader was to read the galley proofs.  Newspaper printing is much different today than it was then.  I would read the galley proofs that--the paper would come off in various strips and I would read portions in galley proofs that were given to me and the other proofreader to read mainly for grammatical errors and for typos.  The proofreader did not copy edit the way copy editors do today, but I was to spot any errors of grammar or any type--typographical errors and to send the galley back to the Atlanta [Georgia] type operator to make a correction.  So at any rate, when I--the--approximately six months that I worked as a proofreader, I did get a chance to do some sports reporting.  You know, I reported on some of the night softball leagues that were fairly popular at that time in Atlanta, and I did a little bit of reporting on some of the college sports in Atlanta.

Speaker 1: Now, what about the Negro league games; were there Negro league games then?
Speaker 2: I didn't write any stories on the Negro league baseball at the time, although I do remember attending some of the games, you know, that were played in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: So they have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  There's an interesting story that I want to tell you about the Negro league team, if you want me, want me to do it now or later on.
Speaker 1: Well, if it fall in the chronology, right now is good.
Speaker 2: Well now, let me just finish with the Atlanta Daily World.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I worked at the Atlanta Daily World, it was approximately from the summer of 1958 to the summer of 1959.  I worked there a year and during that time, mainly during my work as a proofreader, I was introduced to the other weekly newspapers that were printed at the headquarters of the Atlanta Daily World.  There was, there was a newspaper in Memphis [Tennessee], a newspaper in Birmingham [Alabama] and one in Chattanooga [Tennessee], I believe that were printed at the Atlanta Daily World and shipped to Chattanooga or Memphis and Birmingham for distribution there.  There was the Birmingham World, the Memphis World and the Chattanooga [Tribune]--I don't know if the Chattanooga paper was called the World or not.  At any rate, one of the things I remember most about proofreading the copy for the Memphis paper was the Memphis World had a society writer, a lady by the name of Jewel Gentry, G-E-N-T-R-Y.  And I remember reading the society copy that she had written about the different parties where people had attended in Memphis and I remember these stories were probably oh, they ran on and on and on, two or three galleys of copy, and all of this was nothing but people's names.  It was somebody somebody had a party and those who attended the party were a, and she'd go on and on with a whole list of names, and I kept wondering as I read this, why in the world did this woman just want to put everybody's name?  Because later on I figured it out, that was the whole point of doing the column, just put the name of the person who attended 'cause that's the reason why people read society columns 'cause they wanted to read their name in the paper that they had attended a certain party, they had attended another social function.  So I remember that very well about working as a proofreader at the Atlanta World.  And also, my coworker as proofreader at the Atlanta World was a lady by the name of Vashti [Scott] Ellis who was the sister of C.A. Scott, the publisher and the, as I said, principal owner.  The Scott family actually ran--well, most members of the Scott family were employed at the Atlanta World, but the Atlanta World, after it had been founded in 1929 [sic. 1928] by William A. Scott, sometime thereafter, they developed a very bitter feud within the Scott family over ownership and control of the paper and one faction of the family won and another faction of the family lost.  Well, the faction of the Scott family that won included C.A. Scott.  He came out on the winning side of this family feud and some of the other members of the Scott family were on the losing side.  One of the losing Scott family members was a--was Daniel Scott, who was the main printer and Daniel Scott was the one who ran this old very outdated printing press that was used by the Atlanta Daily World.  And Daniel Scott and C.A. Scott didn't get along; it would be fair to say that they were enemies because Daniel Scott was on the losing end of the Scott family feud.  Well, I remember an incident at the paper one day when there was an argument that developed between C.A., the publisher, and Daniel Scott, the printer, and Daniel picked up a wrench and chased C.A. around the room.  He was, he was going to do him in with his wrench.  Well, Dan Scott eventually was restrained and, you know, it kind of subsided, but that was an in--that was one indication of just how bitter the feud was between the members of the various Scott family.  Well, Mrs. Ellis, my proofreading copartner, she would gossip with me off and on and she would tell me about how this feud had developed and what had happened.  And I only regret that I didn't have a tape recorder.  If I had had a tape recorder to record all of this, I would have had a bestselling book at this time because she gave me some of the--she kind of let--gave me some of the family secrets of what had gone on, you know, in this feud between the, the different factions of the, of the Scott family.  At any rate, after in the--it was either the summer, I think either July or August of 1959, I resigned from the Atlanta Daily World and I got enough money to attend the Syracuse University School of Journalism [S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications] in Syracuse, New York, where I now teach.
Story_ID: 227792
Speaker 1: And I first attended there in September 1959, my goal was to get a graduate degree.  I thought, later on I found out incorrectly, but I thought that if I had the graduate degree in journalism and with the limited amount of experience I had gained as a reporter doing sports stories at the Atlanta [Daily] World that I would--could become a marketable person and could eventually get a job; that didn't prove to be correct, but that was my thinking at the time.  So I attended Syracuse University School of Journalism [S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse, New York] from September 1959, to January 1961, and I got my degree in January 1961.  And following the awarding of the degree, I left Syracuse and moved to New York City [New York, New York] and lived with my older sister, Doris [Ward], whose home we're in today.
Speaker 2: Now Syracuse, now Syracuse is a school that Jim Brown attended (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Jim Brown attended--
Speaker 2: --and Ernie, Ernie Davis, right?
Speaker 1: --Syracuse had a very famous football tradition.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Jim Brown, Larry Csonka, Floyd Little, Ernie Davis, John Mackey, all of them attended to play football at Syracuse.  Jim Brown had graduated in 1957, just before I arrived there, but in 1959, the year that I came to Syracuse, Syracuse University had a very good football team, it was the national champion that year, and Ernie Davis, who was a freshman, was a--an All American halfback and won the Heisman trophy in 1959 [sic. 1961], you know.  And on January 1, 1960, Syracuse University played University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas] in the Cotton Bowl, they won 23-14, but it was a game that was marred by a lot of racial slurs that went on, you know, between the Texas ballplayers and the Syracuse ballplayers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I heard they tried to abuse Ernie Davis in the game and--
Speaker 1: Oh, they did and--
Speaker 2: He never said anything.
Speaker 1: --and there was a lot of nigger, nigger that went, went on across the scrimmage line between the Texas players, you know.  Texas was all white at that time and the Syracuse team--Syracuse had several African American players; Ernie Davis was one, John Mackey was another one.  Mackey went on to become an all-time all pro tight end with the Baltimore Colts [Indianapolis Colts].  Art Baker was another player, he played fullback on the Syracuse team.  John Brown, who later had a--an outstanding career as an offensive tackle with the Cleveland Browns, on the same team that Jim Brown played with, he was at Syracuse at the time and John Brown's son, Ernie Da--whose name was Ernie Davis Brown, years later attended Syracuse University and also played football at Syracuse.  Well, all of them were at Syracuse University at the time, and this 1959 team was the national champion, you know, the one that Ernie Davis played on and, and where he was an All American.  So I do remember that very well and remember, you know, living in Syracuse.  Of course, the Syracuse University campus was a lot different then than what it is now, and the School of Journalism was located in a different place than it is today.  A whole new school of journalism has been built and the School of Journalism now is called the Newhouse School of Public Communications, named for Samuel I. Newhouse, who was a very well-known newspaper publisher at that time and who gave several million dollars to establish a new school of journalism named for him which was opened officially as the Newhouse School in 1964.
Story_ID: 227793
Speaker 1: Did anything outstanding happen to you there or--in getting your master's degree?
Speaker 2: Well, a couple things I think I remember, I think are worth telling from, from that experience.  When I attended Syracuse University [School of Journalism; S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse, New York] from 1959 to January 1961, I attended and most of my expenses were paid by a scholarship that was awarded to me by the State of Georgia.  At that time, the State of Georgia and the other southern states would pay African American students a certain amount of money to attend graduate school out of state so that they wouldn't sue to open up the all-white graduated schools in Georgia.  Now, it just so happened that the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] was desegregated in 1962, mainly due to the efforts of a man named Hamilton Holmes and a lady named [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault who--whom I later met because she became a journalist also.  So--but I didn't want to attend the University of Georgia and I had no intention of suing to go to, you know, a--to break down the barriers of segregation because I was not a devotee of the principle of nonviolence, at that time, and I was not the ideal candidate to desegregate.  You know, if somebody spat on me, I'd spit back on him, or if somebody hit me, I'd hit, I'd hit him back and, you know, that was not the kind of person, you know, who was the ideal one to kind of break down these barriers.  You have to kind of be willing to take these insults, you know, if you were going to break down the barriers of segregation.  So I didn't want to go to the University of Georgia.  I had no intention of trying to sue to become the first black, you know, to attend the University of Georgia, so I was happy to take the money the State of Georgia gave me.  It didn't pay all of my expenses, probably paid about 75 percent, and the money I got from my older brother and my family kind of, kind of paid the rest of it, but that's how I spent the three semesters at Syracuse.  And I do remember that when I went to Syracuse University, that I probably got my first real awakening to the--oh, I think I remember at first, you know, approaching a couple of white girls just to establish a friendship with them and I do remember the coldness that they, that they, they showed and I think that was my first real awakening that, you know, if you were going to have friends, you know, it wasn't going to be with the white girls, it was going to be, you know, with the black women.  There weren't that many black women at--black students attending Syracuse at that time, and I didn't--I think the three semesters that I spent there, I didn't, I didn't have a, a black girlfriend, but--oh, I didn't, didn't have any girlfriend, girlfriend at all.  And there were a couple--some people I socialized with, but I spent most of the time studying and trying to make, you know, good grades, you know, to get the degree that I earned.  I do remember that I lived in a house where there were five of us living there.  Five of us shared a room in this house and there were--there was me, there was one white fellow, a man by the name of Earl [O.] Roe, who was from Winnetka, Illinois, and there were two Africans, one from Ghana, one from Nigeria, and another, an Indian, a man from India.  And one of the Africans, the one from Nigeria, had--well, had met Earl Roe, the white man, 'cause he was a missionary and he had, he had worked as a missionary in Africa.  And Earl, this man was kind of a strange fellow.  On most issues regarding race, he was very liberal, you know, very liberal to me, very liberal to the Africans, but he was--he would be regarded today as a rabid, strict fundamentalist.  He was someone out of the school of Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson.  He believed in the strictest interpretation of the Bible.  He believed in all of the biblical miracles.  He obeyed all of the--he followed all of the same prin--tenets and teachings of the very strict Baptist fundamentalists.  So, on matters of religion, he was absolutely conservative, but on matters of race, he was very liberal.  So I do remember attending college with him--
Story_ID: 227794
Speaker 1: I also remember when I was at Syracuse [University, School of Journalism; S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse, New York] being able to attend my first NBA [National Basketball Association] basketball games.  At that time, Syracuse had a NBA team called the Syracuse Nats [Syracuse Nationals; Philadelphia 76ers].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And the star player of the Syracuse Nats, at that time, was a man named--by the name of Dolph Schayes, who's still alive, who's still a businessperson in Syracuse [New York] now.  His son, Danny Schayes later on, you know, became an NBA player.  And the Syracuse basketball games, the games of the Syracuse Nats were played in a location called Syracuse War Memorial Coliseum [Onondaga County War Memorial; War Memorial at Oncenter, Syracuse, New York].  It was maybe four or five--had, had about four or five thousand seats, of course, it was nothing compared to the size of the NBA facilities today.  But I remember attending the Syracuse War Memorial and seeing some games that the Syracuse Nats played and I also remember a doubleheader that was played one night where the first game that was a doubleheader was between the Boston Celtics and the Detroit Pistons and it was the first time I got to see Bill Russell and K.C. Jones play and I happen to remember the Celtics won the game and then the Syracuse Nats, you know, played the second game of the doubleheader.  Syracuse Nats, at that time, had only two blacks who played, one of them was [HistoryMaker] Earl [Francis] Lloyd who, I think, eventually coached a team for a brief, brief time, and a player by the name of Bob Hoskins--[Bob] Hopkins.  Hopkins was his name.  They were the only two blacks who were on the Syracuse Nats team.
Speaker 2: Earl Lloyd is the one they called Pop Lloyd or--
Speaker 1: I don't remember--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --if he had--but he may have had that nickname--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --but I don't remember that.  So I remember Syracuse for that--
Story_ID: 227795
Speaker 1: I remember after I left Syracuse [University, School of Journalism; S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse, New York], I went to New York [New York] in the early 1960s.  From 1961 to 1964, I lived with my older sister [Doris Ward] and my older brother in New York and looked around New York for a job at that time, but wasn't--I wasn't able to get any, any job working with any of the daily newspapers.  New York City had seven daily newspapers at the time and there was the Associated Press and various house organs and other journals, but none of them were hiring.  Not--there were a few blacks who worked on the daily newspapers in New York at the time, but they didn't want to hire somebody who was just out of college.  The tradition, at that time, was that if you wanted to get a job on a newspaper, you had to start at the bottom as a copy boy and work your way up.  And so all of the seven daily newspapers, you know, none of them hired me, even though I had the graduate degree.  Having a journalism degree didn't mean anything to them, what they looked for was did you have any experience, and if you had limited experience, then you wouldn't get hired.  So I eventually wound up taking a job in social work at--in New York and worked for several years as a group worker at two of the settlement houses in New York and I even seriously considered changing careers.
Speaker 2: Which ones were they, the settlement houses?
Speaker 1: Well, one was called Forest Neighborhood House [sic. The Southeast Bronx Neighborhood Centers, Inc. (SEBNC)], which was just across the street from the apartment building where I lived.  It was located at 163rd [Street] and Tinton, T-I-N-T-O-N, 163rd and Tinton Avenue in the South Bronx [New York, New York].  Later on, I left that job and earned a little bit more money at another settlement house that was further up town in the Bronx called Bronx River Neighborhood House [New York, New York].  I think I made about $1,000 a year more working at the Bronx River Neighborhood House than I had, you know, down at the Forest Neighborhood House.
Story_ID: 227796
Speaker 1: And sometime in either 1963 or 1964, I had seriously considered getting a graduate degree in social work and giving up the idea of going into journalism, but what changed my mind about this was that in the summer of 1964, I took a train and went out to Chicago [Illinois].  Never been to Chicago before and while I was there, I went by Ebony magazine and met Bob [Robert L.] Johnson who was, at that time, the editor of Jet magazine and who had also been a Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York] graduate.  He had graduated from Syracuse University School of Journalism [S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse, New York] in 1952.  And Bob Johnson told me that--asked me if I wanted a job, I told him sure I did.  And he told me that later on that year, some--a staff member at Jet magazine was going to be leaving and that, you know, I could have the job if I wanted it, so I told him yes, I did.  So true to form, I think that following either late November or early December, Bob Johnson contacted me in Syracuse [New York] and told me the job opened--was open and I could have it, if I wanted it.  He told me I should come to Chicago, so I did.  So I took a train in late December after Christmas in 1964, and came to Chicago.  I remember staying, I think, about a week or so at the old YMCA [Hotel, Chicago, Illinois] that's down at 800 South Wabash Avenue, which is no longer there.  I mean, I think the building is now condominiums, but the, the YMCA was there.  I think that's where I spent my first couple weeks until I found an apartment in Chicago.  And I went to work for Jet magazine, I think it was maybe the last day of 1964.  I usually tell people that I began in January 1965, but I think my first work day there was either December 30th or December 31st, 1964.  And that was my first real job as a journalist.  That was the first time I had a full-time job as a writer, you know, within a news organization.
Speaker 2: Now, summer of--during the summer of '64 [1964], that was the Freedom Summer of '64 [1964], did you, did you follow that in the news or did you ever--did you have a chance to, to go down or go to Atlantic City [New Jersey] or--
Speaker 1: I followed it in the newspapers.  In the summer of '64 [1964], I still lived in New York and I was following the career of Malcolm X, of course, and Nation of Islam and the other events in the South.  I wasn't a reporter in the summer of '64 [1964], I was still a social worker then, but I was avidly following, you know, close and keeping up with what was happening in the summer of 1964.  And when I went, went to work for Jet magazine in 1965, I wrote stories about the Civil Rights Movement.  Some of them--a few times, I would cover stories directly, but most of the things I wrote were based upon the newspaper accounts, you know, because Jet magazine was a newsweekly and subscribed to a lot of daily papers and a lot of the things that we reported on, you know, from week to week in Jet, these events were based upon, you know, the newspaper accounts, you know.
Story_ID: 227797
Speaker 1: So my first real taste of actually reporting a story on the Civil Rights Movement occurred sometime, I think--the summer of 1965, when I went to Natchez, Mississippi, to do a story about the violence that occurred in Natchez--in--the--just prior to my going to Natchez, Mississippi, the man who was the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] chapter president there had been the object of a bombing by the Ku Klux Klan [KKK].  I mean, he hadn't been killed, but I think his leg had been blown off.  And so Jet magazine sent me down there to do a story about what was happening in Natchez and about this and that, you know, this man, you know, who had been the object of this bombing in Natchez.  So I spent about a day-and-a-half in Natchez and I gathered information about, you know, what was happening there.  And I remember the day we were leaving Natchez, what happened is that we took a flight to Jackson, Mississippi, was--which was a jet and I think we, think we rented a car in Jackson, Mississippi, then we drove to, to Natchez.  I do remember that as we were leaving Natchez, the photographer who was with me at the time on this, this assignment, a man by the name of Isaac Sutton who spent a long many, many years as a photographer with both Jet and Ebony magazines, Isaac Sutton kept looking in the rearview mirror at a truck that was following us and he was wondering if the truck belonged to, you know, any of the enemy, that belonged to a Klansman perhaps.  I couldn't tell, it was too far behind to, to really see who the driver was, but I know Sutton was a little, little fearful that this was a Klan member, you know, who perhaps, you know, wanted to do some violence.  What happened though was that we got to the airport in Natchez, and we took a little small, little small prop plane from Natchez and flew back to Jackson, and I think the--whoever this was following us just wanted to make sure that we got out of town.  I don't think he intended to, to do any violence to us, but I do remember the--being kind of fearful and--that, that whoever this was following us was going to, you know, eventually attempt to do us some violence.  But that was, I think, the, the--that was one of the few times that I got to actually cover a story, you know, firsthand, but most of the stories I wrote about the Civil Rights Movement in 1965, and thereafter, were based upon the accounts that had been done, you know, by the other media.
Story_ID: 227798
Speaker 1: What was the turmoil in Natchez [Mississippi], at that point, can you just briefly comment on that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Well, like--as it was true in cities across Mississippi and across the South, there were there periodic conflicts between the civil rights marches, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and, of course, the whites who, who were resisting.  I don't remember what, if anything, actually prompted this bombing.  I think it was probably an attempt by black people to register and vote in Natchez at the time and, of course, that was a big thing, you know, throughout--through all the cities in Mississippi.  The, the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] violence, at that time, was worse and was at its most intense in cities that had a black majority where if the blacks did get the right to vote, then they would've been able to control politics.  And I think the Klan people, the Klan members and the members of the White Citizens' Council, they knew that.  They knew that if the counties and cities where blacks had a majority if they ever gained control, then, then the whites would be on the losing end, that is the whites would lose their control, so I think it was in those cities where you found the Klan bombing and Klan violence and the Klan intimidation most intense and Natchez was one of these cities, you know.  It was on the Mississippi River, you know, kind of in south central Mississippi, it wasn't in the Mississippi Delta, but it was in south central Mississippi.  And it was just typical of the kind of bombing and campaign of intimidation and, and threats of violence that were commonplace across Mississippi and the other states of the South at the time.
Story_ID: 227799
Speaker 1: So how long did you work for Jet?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked for Jet magazine for a little more than a year, about fourteen months, and then I think it was in February of--wait a minute, I worked for Jet mag in 1965 and '66 [1966], about two years, and then I think it was February of 1967, I was promoted to the Ebony magazine staff.  I got a pay raise from $100 a week to $150 a week when I got promoted to the Ebony staff and I thought that that was kind of a big thing.  One of the things I guess I should say, you know, in talking about my experience at Jet magazine was that that was how I met my wife, [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward].  It was in 1965, early 1965, that the editor of Jet, Bob [Robert L.] Johnson, had attended an affair where this young woman who did poet--who do--did dramatic interpretations of poetry, where she had spoken and he was quite impressed.  So he wanted me to go out and interview and do a story on this lady who--lady her--who, who at that time was named--was known as Val Gray.  So I did go out and I interviewed Val Gray and struck up a friendship with her and the friendship eventually blossomed into love and eventually we got married, you know, in January of 1966, but that's how I met her.
Story_ID: 227800
Speaker 1: We're going to backtrack and tell the Negro League--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --story then, okay?
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: When was it?
Speaker 2: One of the things that I wanted to mention earlier when I was discussing, you know, growing up in Atlanta [Georgia] and the experiences I had there was that during the 1940s and I don't think into the '50s [1950s], it could've extended to the--I do remember the 1940s prior to the time that Jackie Robinson big--broke in with the Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers] in 1947.  Atlanta had a black baseball team, it was called the Atlanta Black Crackers.  Now, my wife, [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward] and I have had lots of arguments and discussions about this; she's always wondered why would a black baseball team call itself the Crackers?  Well, I've tried to explain to her, the word cracker didn't mean then what it means today.  At that time, at least white Georgians, not black people, but white Georgians considered the name cracker to be like a term of endearment.  You know, it was kind of a, a good thing for a white person in Georgia to call himself a Georgia cracker.  And also it was the tradition, at that time, for the black baseball team to take the name of whatever the white baseball team was.  You know, you had some black baseball teams called the New York Black Yankees and some called the New York--Memphis Red Sox and some--the team in Birmingham [Alabama], the team that Willie Mays first played baseball with was called the Bir--the Birmingham Black Barons.  You know, it wasn't true in every case, but in some cases in the cities where you had, of course, an established white team and, of course, you know, black baseball team, the black baseball team would adopt the name of the white team.  So the people who ran the black team in Atlanta simply adopted the name of the white baseball team which, at that time, wasn't Atlanta Braves [Milwaukee Braves], it was called the white team which played in minor league AA baseball was called the Atlanta Crackers and they played their games at a park called Ponce de Leon Park [Atlanta, Georgia] which was out on Ponce de Leon Avenue; this--it's no longer there.  And Ponce de Leon Avenue, well it was one of the main thoroughfares.  I think it, it still is today, although the ballpark where the class AA Atlanta Crackers team played, you know, its own games, it--the ballpark no longer exists, but the Atlanta black team called itself the Atlanta Black Crackers and, as I said, the reason was that people didn't regard the word cracker as synonymous with being, you know, an ardent white racist the way we do today.  And because of this habit of the black team adopting the name of the white team, they did it and nobody really thought that much of it then, but today, one would, would regard this as very strange, you know, a black baseball team calling themselves the crackers.  But the team was pretty good.  I don't ever remember any of the great stars like Satchel Paige or Josh Gibson playing in Atlanta, but I knew there were a lot of good players who played for this, this team and I think some of them certainly would've been capable of playing major league baseball, you know.
Speaker 1: I--I've heard that Hank Aaron got his start playing for the Atlanta team, but I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure of that, he may have.  I don't ever remember Hank Aaron--
Speaker 1: Isn't he from that area?  From--
Speaker 2: I don't think Hank Aaron--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, is from the Atlanta, Atlanta area, no, I don't believe so.  You know, he didn't begin with the Milwaukee [Wisconsin]--I think it was the Milwaukee Braves, I think, un--until--
Speaker 1: Right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: --either 1952 or 1953, which was well after, you know, my time.  Well, I think--I don't think the Atlanta Black Crackers, you know, even existed then.  I think, you know, the team, you know, had, had folded, you know, by then.  But I do remember going to Ponce de Leon Park to see some of the games of the Atlanta Black Crackers and some of the games were played out at the Harper's Field, which was the field next to my high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] which had a little stadium there where our high school team played.  The Atlanta Black Crackers played some of their, their home games there.
Story_ID: 227801
Speaker 1: One of the things, I guess, during that same time period that I think, you know, I want to recall and talk about was that when Jackie Robinson broke in with the Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers] in 1947, of course, he had a big following, you know, among black baseball fans everywhere.  And at that time, my father [Jefferson Ward], his--well, his habit was and the rule in our house was that we didn't, we didn't attend any, any social functions, any sports functions on Sunday, you know.  Sunday was supposed to be reserved for going to church and we didn't even listen to the radio on Sunday.  But I do remember one Sunday during the spring training before the baseball season officially started, you know, at that time, the Brooklyn Dodgers had their training camp in Vero Beach, Florida, and I think, you know, they, they may still maintain the facility.  So anyway, the habit was for the big league teams to begin spring training in February and play exhibition games in some of the southern cities and then work their way north and then eventually open up the season, you know, in, in April.  Well anyway, the Brooklyn Dodgers, when Jackie Robinson was playing with them in 1947, had an exhibition game in Atlanta [Georgia] and a lot of the black people in Atlanta were excited to go out to Ponce de Leon Park [Atlanta, Georgia] to see Jackie Robinson play this exhibition game.  And I remember my father made an exception to his rule that day, that day it was okay to go to a baseball game because Jackie Robinson was playing.  Now, this was a very big baseball park, but at the time, blacks were segregated.  We sat out in left field about 360 feet from home plate and that was the only, that was the only area of the stadium where blacks were allowed to sit.  So--but the, the leftfield stadium was all standing room only with nothing but black people because Jackie Robinson, you know, was playing that, that Sunday and because my father and I, we were among them.  There weren't that many whites who came out that day, maybe only no more than a thousand whites, you know, who came to see the game and I think it was an exhibition game between the Atlanta [Black] Crackers team and the Brooklyn Dodgers, I think, which the Brooklyn Dodgers won handedly.  But we were all, you know, rooting for Jackie Robinson, you know, to do well that day, but I remember it because that was the day, probably the only time my father made an exception to his rule of not listening to the radio and not attending any of the things--not doing anything else but go--except going to church on Sunday, you know, when Jackie Robinson, you know, came to Atlanta for this exhibition baseball game.

Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to fast forward now--I mean, I guess, back up to Ebony and Jet.  Now--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you're at Ebony now and--
Speaker 2: Okay.  In, I think, it was February 1967, I began working as a feature writer with Ebony magazine and I guess the Ebony assignment that I remember the most was later on that year, I think it was the summer of 1967--no, wait a minute.  No.  No.  No.  Let me backtrack.  I think it was--oh, it was, it was beginning--at the time I had begun working with Ebony, I had one last assignment to do for Jet magazine and this was an assignment to go to Houston, Texas to cover the fight between Muhammad Ali and [HistoryMaker] Ernie Terrell.  Ali was heavyweight champion at that time and Terrell was one of the main, main challengers.  And the fight was to be held in the Houston Astrodome [Houston, Texas], the old Houston Astrodome.  And I went to Houston to cover the fight, but my--the story that I wrote was not about the outcome of the fight because by the time my story got in, in the magazine, everybody knew what the outcome.  Muhammad Ali won a lopsided victory; I mean, it was almost no contest between him and Ernie Terrell.  But my assignment was to cover and write about who the celebrities were at ringside and I remember I spent the whole fifteen rounds going around getting the names, and I had a photographer, I think Isaac Sutton may have been the photographer with me at the time, getting pictures of, of the celebrity people.  I remember Lou Rawls was there, I--and I also remember Joe Louis, the former heavyweight champion was there and I remember he had a lady friend with him and I asked the woman what her name was and she didn't want to give me her name.  So--and I asked her several times and she adamantly refused to give me her name, so we ran a picture of Joe Louis and this woman in Jet magazine and we just mentioned in my picture caption that she refused to give her name and we ran Joe Louis' picture, you know, with her, with her in the picture.  But I remember Lou Rawls, I don't think I remember any of the others--other celebrities who were there, but that was the main thing that Jet magazine wanted.  You know, it didn't necessarily want, you know, like a blow by blow account of the fight itself because by, as I said, everybody knew, you know, who had won the fight, you know, but Jet wanted to do a story on who the famous celebrities, mainly, you know, who the black celebrities were who attended the fight and that was the focus of my story and I think that was the last story that I did for Jet, and after that, you know, I did the monthly feature stories for Ebony magazine.
Story_ID: 227803
Speaker 1: Did you work with [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett at Ebony on those or--
Speaker 2: I didn't work directly with him, I knew him.  You know, that was, that was when I got to know Lerone Bennett very well.  He--his specialty, at that time, were the monthly feature stories on black history, which he, which he--which appeared every month in the issue of Ebony magazine at that time.  I didn't work closely with Lerone, but as I say, we got to know each other and we became friends, at that time.  I also got to know and became friends with Hoyt W. Fuller, who was the editor at that time of the magazine known as Black World [Negro Digest] that most of us read and admired.  It was the best literary magazine on the black consciousness movement of the 1960s, I think, that, that was printed by anybody.  And I got to know Hoyt very well, I even did some freelance articles for Black World, you know, while I was on the Ebony magazine staff.
Speaker 1: Now, it was--I think it was Negro Digest when you started right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was called Negro Digest and later on, the name was changed to Black World, yes.
Speaker 1: Some of the people on the staff, I mean, for those who read Ebony and Jet a long time are the--and, and Negro Digest, Era Bell Thompson and, and did you get a chance to work with her any or--
Speaker 2: I knew Era Bell Thompson.  She was also--she was probably a--I think the senior writer at--on the Ebony magazine staff at that time.  Herbert Nipson was the editor of the magazine and he and I became--you know, we--I had a closer working relationship with him than I had, you know, with the other staff members.  I don't have a good recollection of the stories I wrote.  Most of the stories I wrote were about either celebrity figures or not real hard hitting subjects.  I do remember that I contributed a piece to an Ebony issue on the future of black young people at that time and I wrote a feature story, you know, on that.  But most of the other, other assignments I had, you know, were not related to politics or government or the Civil Rights Movement, they were related to black celebrities.  I remember I did a feature piece on, on Leslie Uggams who had married a man from Australia at the time.
Speaker 1: Right.  It was a, it was a white man from Australia, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I wrote more of those, those kinds of stories for Ebony magazine and I think that kind of gave me the first taste of the preference of Eb--Ebony magazine for celebrity type stories over more hard, hard hitting stories--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --on, on what was going on in the Civil Rights Movement at the time.
Speaker 1: Now, did you want to write more substantive material?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  Yeah, I did.  But the magazine preferred, you know, stories on stories that were less controversial, that were, that were less hard hitting because frankly, those were the kinds of stories that Mr. Johnson, [HistoryMaker] John H. Johnson felt, you know, would be more palatable, you know, to the white advertisers, you know, who advertised in the magazine.
Story_ID: 227804
Speaker 1: I remember one of the editorial meetings that we had when I was on the Ebony staff and I think it was [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett who proposed doing a story on either H. Rap Brown or Stokely Carmichael, who later on changed his name to Kwame Ture.  They were, of course, the most vocal of the most strident civil rights leadership figures at the time and H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael, of course, had split off from the mainstream civil rights leadership which was composed, at that time, of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and Roy Wilkins of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and James Farmer of CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality and--
Speaker 2: Whitney Young.
Speaker 1: Whitney Young of the National Urban League.  They were regarded as the mainstream civil rights leaders, but Stokely Carmichael and Rap Brown were regarded as the most radical or revolutionary leaders and, and the most vocal and the most critical of American leadership figures and political figures.  Well, Lerone Bennett proposed that Ebony magazine do a story on either Rap Brown or Stokely Carmichael; well, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [John H.] Johnson objected.  He, he said no, he didn't want to do it and he went into almost a tirade of, of about ten minutes of why it wouldn't be a good idea for Ebony magazine to do a story on Stokely Carmichael or Rap Brown.  Well, I didn't understand why at the time because, I mean, I didn't ask Mr. Johnson.  He was the publisher of the magazine and I didn't ask him why he didn't want to do it, but later on, you know, it became evident to me that the reason why he didn't want to do a story on either one of them, at least at the time, was because both Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael were very critical of the [President Lyndon Baines] Johnson administration, you know, the administration of Lyndon Johnson that was president and Mr. Johnson, that didn't necessarily sit well with him.  And he felt--well, at that time, he was moving toward, you know, becoming closer--having a closer identification with the Johnson administration, you know, and not, not catering to people who criticized, you know, the administration.  I think sometime later on, Ebony magazine did do--after I had left the magazine, Ebony magazine did do a story of--on either--it might have done a story on both Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael.  But I remember when the idea first came up, Mr. Johnson resisted the idea and my feeling today was because it was because of the very strident criticism that both men had made of the Johnson administration and also because they were not re--they were not looked upon kindly by both--by either the black establishment or the white establishment.
Speaker 2: And they, they were considered militant troublemakers.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  Yeah, they were regarded then as radical revolutionaries, which I think, you know, both of them eventually became and both of them, I think, eventually wore the mantle of radical revolutionaries thereafter.
Story_ID: 227805
Speaker 1: Now, did you feel at the time that, that by not doing a [Ebony] story on them that this kind of increased the misunderstanding between different factions in the black community or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I think so.  You know, it was, it was typical during the 1960s for the white establishment media to do favorable stories on [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and Whitney Young and to do very harsh negative stories on [H.] Rap Brown and, and, and Stokely [Carmichael; Kwame Ture].  The, the point of these stories was always--it was the Whitney Youngs and the Martin Luther Kings who got things done and people like Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael and Rap Brown, all they did was talk.  All they had was rhetoric, but had no, had no program, they had no plan, all they did was just run off at the mouth and so they didn't really accomplish anything.  It was the people who really accomplished things were the Whitney Youngs and the Martin Luther Kings, the people who worked with the establishment figures to get jobs and to get, you know, legislation passed.  But I do remember that was the tenor of stories in the, in the, in the white media at that time, and even after I began working with the white media, those kinds of stories still continued to appear from time to time.  But, you know, the idea was for the more militant people like Malcolm X to be regarded as somebody who just talked and who didn't do anything whereas, the other people were folks who actually got things accomplished.
Story_ID: 227806
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, in that regard, let's go back to Hoyt Fuller now.  Hoyt W. Fuller and Black World and--well, Negro Digest then, I think it changes in 1970 to Black World (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Let me tell you the story of how the name got changed.  I left Ebony magazine in 1967, and in January 1968, I began working as a general assignment reporter with the Chicago Sun-Times, the first white news organization I ever worked with.
Speaker 1: This is in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Nine--January 1968, yes.  And in I think it was 1970, my wife, [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward], whom I had met when I was a reporter with Jet magazine was among those who had become vocal in their criticism of Johnson Publishing Company [Chicago, Illinois].  And my wife and others had organized some picketing outside the Johnson Publishing Company main offices which were, at that time, were located at 1820 South Michigan Avenue, very near to where The HistoryMakers' offices are located today at 1900 South Michigan; we were located across the street.  At any rate, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [John H.] Johnson--there weren't that many picketers and these weren't, these--the protest by today's standards, you know, didn't really matter that much, but Mr. Johnson didn't like the idea of having people, people picket outside so he sometimes had discussions with Val and the other folks who were picketing and wanted to know what it, what it was he could do to kind of satisfy what they wanted.  So one of the things Val suggested to him was that he change the name of the magazine from Negro Digest to Black World because at that time, you know, it was customary for blacks who at least who considered themselves to be conscious and more enlightened to no longer call themselves Negro, but, but to adopt the identification of either being black or African--or, or Afro American.  So Mr. Johnson agreed.  He agreed to change the name from Negro Digest to change, to change it from Negro Digest to Black World and he also agreed to publish a book on Gwendolyn Brooks which we were instrumental in doing.  Val and I, with the Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] at that time, were instrumental in organizing a tribute to Gwendolyn Brooks which took place in December 1969, at the old Afro-Arts Theater [Chicago, Illinois] which used to be located at Oakwood Boulevard and Drexel Boulevard in Chicago [Illinois].  And people from all over the country, poets, artists and other people came to the Afro Arts and paid tribute to Gwendolyn Brooks.  And what happened was that we collected the things that people had written about Gwendolyn Brooks for this tribute and we wanted to put them in, in a book and have it published as a tribute to Gwendolyn Brooks and I was one of the coeditors.  There were three coeditors at that time; another one of the coeditors was Patricia Brown, who was a member of the Kuumba Theatre and another one was a young man by the name of Don Lee, Don L. Lee from Little Rock, Arkansas who later became Haku--Hak--Haki R.--Haki L. Madhubuti [HistoryMaker Haki Madhubuti], you know.  We were the three coeditors of this book, so we collected the different poems and essays that had been written as a tribute to Gwendolyn Brooks.  I authored one of the essays myself and I also was, was one of the coeditors and we compiled them, you know, and they were edited and this book was eventually published by Johnson Publishing Company.  And we gave the name to--of--the book was named 'To Gwen With Love [An Anthology Dedicated to Gwendolyn Brooks,' Lee and Woods (eds.), Brown],' which was the same name that we had given this tribute at the Afro-Arts Theater to Gwendolyn Brooks and it was published by Johnson Publishing and I think the year--I'm pretty sure the year was 1970 [sic. 1971].
Story_ID: 227807
Speaker 1: What's your perspective on the founding of Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois]?  And I wanted to ask you also about the riot of 1968, when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed in Chicago [Illinois].  I know you were, you were--
Speaker 2: I was a reporter with, with the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) caught in some very dangerous situations in that riot--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, so--
Speaker 2: Well, let me, let me--I guess let me go back a little bit even further.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Chicago had three major riots or disturbances.  Some people like the term disturbances instead of riots, but--
Speaker 1: Or revolts.
Speaker 2: Or revolts, perhaps.  The first one was in the summer of 1965, on the West Side of Chicago.  All of these revolts or disturbances originated on the West Side of Chicago, not the South Side.  The first one was in 1965, and it was by today's standards, a major revolt where a lot of people were involved and there was a lot of property damage and it lasted close to a full, a full day.  But the revolt in 1965 in Chicago didn't get much press coverage because it occurred at the same time as the Watts Riot in Los Angeles [California] in August of 1965.  The second major disturbance or revolt on the West Side of Chicago occurred in the summer of 1966, and this was during the same time when Martin Luther King had come to Chicago and was leading a series of open housing demonstrations, but the riot on the West Side of Chicago really was not sparked by Dr. King's open housing marches, it was caused by an incident between--it didn't take much to spark a riot, at that time.  What happened was that a white police officer had closed a fire hydrant on a hot summer day where some black kids were playing and this led to an argument and things escalated from there and eventually, this--what started as the closing of the fire hydrant eventually escalated into a full scale riot that lasted about three days.  I was working for Jet magazine at the time and I remember writing stories about the riot on the West Side of Chicago in the summer of 1966.  And I remember one of the things about that particular time was that while my wife, [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward], and I and a colleague, a man by the name of David Lorenz [ph.], who was a colleague at Ebony magazine, Dave, Val and I, we spent a lot of time on the West Side during the riot and while we were out one night, we ran into a man who was in the Illinois National Guard; the Guard had been called out to patrol.  And this was a black man in the Illinois National Guard by the name of Harold [E.] Charles.  And Harold Charles, we later became good friends with because he later became head of a--an African American school [Shule YA Watoto, Chicago, Illinois] on the West Side of Chicago.  And he quit his post in the Illinois National Guard following the riot of 1966, and he adopted an African name and I'm trying to remember the African name and I'm embarrassed--
Speaker 1: It's [Baba] Hannibal Afrik (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Hannibal Afrik, yes, that's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah, Hannibal Afrik.  And he became very well-known as an educator with this African school on the West Side of Chicago, but that's how I first met him when he was a--toting--carrying an M16 rifle and he was a member of the National Guard patrolling the West Side of Chicago.  He taught for many years at Farragut High School [Farragut Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] on the West Side of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Science teacher, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Taught science.
Speaker 2: And that was my first encounter.  It was the first time I met Harold Charles, who later became Hannibal Afrik.
Speaker 1: And his sister became the editor of the [Chicago] Defender after a while, Faith Christmas.
Speaker 2: Faith Christmas, yes.  Right.
Story_ID: 227808
Speaker 1: Now, the third major disturbance or riot on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois] occurred on April 5th, 1968.  By that time, I had become a reporter with the Chicago Sun-Times, but I'd like to explain the background to this.  [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated on April 4, 1968, while he, while he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee.  I was in the sitting room of the Chicago Sun-Times around six p.m. that evening when the--my immediate superior, the city editor, a man by the name of Ken [Kenneth D.] Towers, approached me and asked me had I heard the news that Dr. King had been shot; I had not, so he gave me a little dispatch from the Associated Press, which kind of explained the details.  And he said well, we needed to do some kind of a follow-up story that would be local in nature.  So he asked me if I would get in my car and go around and just drive around to different neighborhoods to find out what people, what people were doing, how they were responding to this.  And so I told him I would, although I was supposed to get off work at six o'clock, but I told him it was okay.  I didn't mind doing that 'cause I was curious about it myself.  I wanted to know what the local reaction to Dr. King's death was.  So I spent about three hours driving all over the West Side, driving all over the South Side and nothing was happening.  There was an eerie silence that--I found nobody on the street, hardly anybody to talk to on both the South Side and the West Side.  So I think when I got home that night around ten o'clock, I mentioned to [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward] how strange this was.  I had even visited the old Wall of Respect which used to be located on the building at 43rd [Street] and Langley Avenue, which both my wife and I had attended, you know, when the paintings of the wall were first done.  We knew most of the artists who were, who were intimately involved in that, people like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  The AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] people?
Speaker 1: AfriCOBRA artists, [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson, [HistoryMaker] Napoleon [Jones-Henderson], many of, many of the artists who--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we were close friends with him.  I visited the Wall of Respect and there was nobody there.  There was nobody on the street.  There was hardly any visible reaction at all.  So I mentioned to my wife that evening when I got home how strange this was and I told her this sounded to me like kind of the calm before the storm.  Well, the following day, April 5th, 1968, the newspaper city editor asked me again to visit some of the black communities to see what reaction was occurred at that time.  And, of course, that afternoon oh, I guess around noontime, I then drove over to the West Side of Chicago and when I first arrived, I remember stopping at a restaurant that was on the corner of Homan Avenue and Madison Street, and at that time, nothing was happening.  And so I asked the woman who owned the restaurant, you know, was she afraid that something was going to happen, something, something going to break out?  And she said, no, she wasn't afraid because she felt that if any people were going to start something, start either a riot or disturbance of any kind, they would know the difference between those businesses that were owned by blacks and those that were not.  Well, it didn't really turn out to be that case because I think about an hour later, I saw the first signs of the burning and looting that had occurred.  The first signs, I think, of the major riot that occurred on April 5th, 1968, in Chicago, I think, were along Madison Street, I think in the twenty hundred block of Madison Street.  And so most of that day, April 5th, 1968, I spent walking up and down Madison Street.  My assignment was to observe what was happening, what people were doing, where there was burning, where there was looting, and then I would phone into the paper periodically, you know, just to tell them what my observations were.  And so I remember that as I was going back and forth, up and down Madison Street at the time, the biggest difficulty was to find a telephone that worked, you know.  And I finally remember going into a bar and calling the paper just to tell them what I had seen and which buildings, you know, were burning and which building, buildings I thought, you know, where looting had, had taken place.  And as I was on the phone talking to the city desk of the Sun-Times, I remember there were people streaming in and out of this bar and one guy stopped and looked at me and heard me talking on the phone and, and I immediately sensed that this guy probably thought that I was an undercover cop.  So I abruptly terminated the conversation and kind of politely walked out of the bar, you know, and he didn't do anything; he didn't approach me or anything, but I think, you know, he got suspicious when he heard me on the telephone.  But I didn't really feel any danger from that, you know.  It--I guess, you know, it could've been, but I toured the area for hours.  I got in my car.  A lot of times I walked.  And I remember that night, the night of April 5th, 1968, I was in the vicinity of the Sears Roebuck [and Co.] complex which were near between Roosevelt Road and Arthington [Street], I think, on the West Side.
Speaker 2: Right.  That's (unclear).
Speaker 1: And I remember distinctly the voice, I don't know who this was, I heard a voice ring out that said, "Let's go get Sears."  This was some young man saying Sears Roebuck would be the target next.  Well, I don't think there was much damage to Sears 'cause Sears Roebuck, you know, was very well protected by its own private security and contingent of Chicago police officers, you know, by that time.  But many blocks of West Side of Chicago had been devastated and burned out, you know.  And I later, you know, spent some time the night of April 5th, 1968, on the South Side and there was very little going on, on the South Side, almost none of this.  All of the burning and the looting and the disruption and the disturbance was confined to just certain blocks of the West Side, along Madison Street, along Roosevelt Road and some other blocks.
Story_ID: 227809
Speaker 1: Talk about the development of Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois].  I know that's really close to you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that started around 1968, right?
Speaker 2: The theatre officially began working in the spring of 1968.  I don't--neither [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward] nor I, remember the date, but Val was more instrumental in finding it than I was.  She had talked for some months about finding an organization that would be dedicated to a new set of values and a new set of principles.  She wanted an arts and theater organization that would, although, be activist.  And she wanted an organization that would depart from the prevailing principle at that time that art was only for the sake of entertainment, and that art or theater should be only to help groom people for careers, you know, later on, you know, in Hollywood or on Broadway.  She wanted an arts organization that would do more than entertain people.  I mean, we wanted to entertain people, we wanted them to have a good time who came to the theater.  She also wanted an arts organization that would be willing to take a stand and that would, would offer an interpretation of the black experience which was different from the prevailing, you know, interpretation that existed at the time.  So she got the idea of founding an organization called Kuumba, K-U-U-M-B-A.  It was the same name as the six of the seven principles, you know, that we recite as the Nguzo Saba.  And we specifically selected the name Kuumba because of the--of its African roots.  Kuumba in the key Swahilian language of East Africa meant to create, and was also translated as creativity.  Kuumba is also used in the Shona language in Zimbabwe, which means to build creatively with ones hands.  And in several cultures of West Africa, Kuumba is used as the first name of a woman.  So we liked it particularly because, you know, because of its African roots and Kuumba was founded and Val and I developed sort of a division of labor which lasted throughout the life of the theater, was that she would be mainly in charge of the creative side, and I would be mainly in charge of the management fiscal side, you know.  I was the one who kept the records, and kept the books, and wrote the grant applications; and she was the one who direct the play.  She would select the plays to be done and she would direct them, and she would select the actors or musicians, you know, at the time even when we used musicians.  And it sort of worked that way in the early days.  In the earliest days, Kuumba didn't have a permanent home.  We--I don't remember the--well, among the first locations where we staged plays, you know, in 1968 and 1969, the South Side Community Art Center [Chicago, Illinois] which is still located at 3831 South Michigan Avenue.  We did, for a time, we did--I remember we did a big ritual performance, I think, in 1968 or 1969 at a church [St. James United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois] at 46th [Street] and Ellis Avenue.  A ritual for us was defined as a performance that was spontaneously done; that is, where people would simply spontaneously express themselves either in poetry or in song.  The idea was to draw on, you know, the natural talent of the people who had something to say, you know, either as poets or either as creative people, and we did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Just a word on that.  In those days with all the agitation going around, there was a lot of people willing to express themselves and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --it seems the days of the Black Arts Movement and people were looking for a venue to--they were writing and--
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.  Well, the ritual type performance was part of what we did regularly.  And we did some shows at the south arts center, we did some at this church at 46th and Ellis.  I'm trying to remember some of the other locations where we--during the early formative years.  I can't remember others--
Story_ID: 227810
Speaker 1: But we [Kuumba Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] eventually wound up in 1974, I think, wound up doing shows at a space at 2222 South Michigan Avenue, and we stayed there maybe about seven or eight years.  And we staged a whole lot of plays, some of them very traditional, some of them were ritual-type plays.  Among the many plays that we did, you know, when Kuumba was founded in '68 [1968] and thereafter, we did--I'm trying to remember.  I should remember the names.  I should know them by heart.  I remember we did one show called 'The Image Makers,' which was a play written in 1972, I think, by Eugene Perkins, [HistoryMaker] Useni Eugene Perkins.  It was a spoof or a commentary on the black exploitation trend going on in Hollywood at the time.  And it was very successful for us financially and otherwise.  We did a play based on the life of Langston Hughes, called 'Langston Living.'  We did some of the work Sandra [ph.] or can't remember the name--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Sonia Sanchez?
Speaker 1: Well, Sonia Sanchez, but this other lady.  This woman had written plays under her name--under the name Sandra.  I can't remember the--she wrote a play called 'The Sisters,' [ph.] and I remember we staged that--we did, oh, several versions of 'The Amen Corner,' you know, by James Baldwin.  You know, we did one at South Side Community Arts [South Side Community Art Center, Chicago, Illinois]--I mean and one at the 2221--2222 South Michigan location, and we also did it later on, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the theater, we did a performance of that in nineteen--not the twenty--no, I think it was the tenth anniversary of the theater.  In 1978, we did a performance of it, you know, when we invited James Baldwin, you know, to come and to view it.  The theater was one of the arts groups that performed at the World Festival of Black and African Arts [sic. Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture] called FESTAC in Lagos, Nigeria in January--February of 1978 [sic. 1977] and our entry at FESTAC was this--'The Image Makers,' the play we had done, you know, that spoofed the black exploitation [blaxploitation] films.

Speaker 1: As I said, there was an activist component to the Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], you know, because our idea was to become active and vocal on issues that we thought were central to the black experience, and one of the issues that we became very vocal on in the early 1970s was very vocal opposition to this trend in the films have been now--well, which were then dubbed exploitation [blaxploitation] films.  Films like 'Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,' 'Super Fly,' the 'Shaft' series.  We thought that these films for the most part, had very negative images which didn't transmit the right kinds of messages, you know, to people; particularly, impressionable young, young people.  And so we adopted a position paper, you know, critical of 'Sweet Sweetback,' adopted a position paper critical of 'Super Fly.'  One of the things we criticized about 'Super Fly' was that it actively encouraged people to use drugs, because in the film the lead character of the 'Super Fly' film, if you will remember it, is a Harlem [New York, New York] dope dealer by the name of Priest who was a very successful being a dope dealer, but he has this plan that he's going to do one final score where he's going to sell a half million dollars in drugs and then use the money to retire on.  Well, in the film as you go about, as you watch it, every time he succeeds in doing something, you know, he snorts coke [cocaine], then he goes out and scores with his girlfriend; he snorts coke, and then he goes out and scores with something else.  And there is an undeniable connection between him snorting the coke and him being successful in the film.  Well, we pointed this out in our position paper.  And [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward] and I were criticized by some other people who thought that the black exploitation films were good, because it offered blacks, and for the first time in large numbers, chances to have roles, you know, in Hollywood films.  Well, we didn't necessarily mind that, although, I don't think that those people who got jobs, you know, in the films really made that much money or really--a few careers were launched then.  Most of the people who acted in those films have long since been forgotten about.  I was--watching just, just the other night, I just happen to be watching a film that was popular at that time.  A film called 'The Mack' starring a man named Max Julien.  'The Mack' was about pimps, you know, about pimps and their lives, and as I was watching this film or, at least, the, the VHS version of it, I kept asking myself where is Max Julien now?  I don't even know where he is.  And I think shortly after the--shortly after, maybe, 1974, '75 [1975], he sort of disappeared from the scene and so did most of the other people.  Most of the exploitation films were written and developed by whites, specifically aimed at exploiting black audiences.  I remember very vividly seeing a version of 'Super Fly' that played at the Oriental Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], which at that time was located off on Randolph Street in Chicago [Illinois].  It's no longer a movie theater.  And how the theater was filled to capacity by mostly young people, and at the end of the 'Super Fly' film there's a scene where 'Super Fly' defies the corrupt white police superintendent, and he goes--after a fight, he wins the fight with the corrupt white cops, and the, the white superintendent wants him to go back into the dope trade, but he refuses to do so and says, "I'm a free man now."  So he gets into his big pimpmobile and he rolls away, and that's the end of the film.  As he rolled away, the whole theater just went wild.  The roar of approval was deafening.  It went on for about five minutes, you know, with people approving, because one of the key aspects of these exploitation films was somehow the black had to be triumphant over the white, and so this was an example of black people beating the white man.  And so people like that, they thought that that was good, you know, when black people beat the white man.  Well, one of the things about 'Sweet Sweetback,' at least, which the people that liked 'Sweet Sweetback' which they liked, which we didn't--Val and I didn't think it was necessarily was that--in the film he manages to escape capture by the cops and runs all the way from Los Angeles [California] a hundred miles to the Mexican border and he escapes.  Well, people thought that because he escaped the white cops that that was an idea of black triumph, but we didn't--my wife and I didn't regard it as black triumph, we regarded this as fantasy.  I mean, it was, it was just pure fantasy.  The whole idea that the LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department], would--that the cops would be so bumbling and so stupid that they would let somebody continuously get away when they had a chance to catch them.  Anyway, there was some people who liked 'Sweet Sweetback.'  Val and I didn't like it, and this--our position on the black exploitation films, you know, caused something--well, there was some disagreement among us and some of our other friends in the black consciousness movement but also the blacks, you know, who got jobs or the people who thought it was a good idea for black people to start working in Hollywood.  They were very critical of our stance but it didn't our, our mind at all.  But that was an idea of the kind of work we thought the theater should do.  It should be activists on the one hand and it should do theater on the other hand, but all with the idea of helping to raise the consciousness of people, you know, African Americans, especially.
Story_ID: 227812
Speaker 1: You wrote about these issues in the Black World [Negro Digest] and in a newsletter that Kuumba [Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] had--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And in some of the other papers that were available in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Yes, the Kuumba Theatre issued its own little newsletter once a month called the Kuumba News, and I was the main one who edited and wrote for that.  Sometimes [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward] would contribute a piece and sometimes other members of the theater would.  But we did that.  We expressed our views on both the film trend and other things that would be going on.  And also, we used the Kuumba News as a vehicle to criticize some of the things that we thought, some of the trends that we thought, you know, were harmful to us that were prevalent in some African societies.  Like, like the trend in placing black women in what we regarded as inferior social roles.  We thought that--at least, Val and I thought, certainly, you know, in terms of our marriage, we were equal partners but we also thought that black men and women should be equal partners.  And we said, we didn't like the idea of relegating black women only to the role of being the housekeeper, being the person to rear the children.  That black women should be able to do whatever they wanted to do whatever their talents, you know, entitled them to do.  We didn't like the idea of separating the men and women at the Kwanzaa celebrations, and this didn't sit well with some of the other people in the nationalist community, you know, who felt that we should follow the traditional African practice of separating the men and the women, and that in the relationship between man and woman, that it was the male who was the dominant partner.  We didn't think that that was a good idea and we said so.  And some of our friends, you know, some of our nationalist friends criticized us for that.
Story_ID: 227813
Speaker 1: Another thing that we got some criticism for from some of the nationalists, was that in the early 1970s, we began to accept money from white funding sources, like the Illinois Arts Council [Agency, Chicago, Illinois] and the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA].  Well, there were some people, particularly, some of our friends at the Institute of Positive Education [Chicago, Illinois] who were highly critical of the Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] for this.  They said that, no, you couldn't be a black organization that maintained its integrity and principles if you accepted money from whites.  The idea was that if you took money from whites, then the whites would control you.  Well, we rejected that idea.  We said--this was taxpayer's money.  We were just entitled to it as anybody else, but we also rejected the idea that if you took money from a white funding source that you would be controlled by the whites.  Yeah, there was strings attached to it.  There were strings attached to any money that you would take from anybody.  If you took money from a black funding source, there would be strings attached to it too.  But our argument was then and still is today, that you could live with the strings.  You can use the money for what you needed to use it for without having the whites control you.  Well, there was some blacks who didn't like that, and so that caused something of a riff between us and them, but we stood our ground and we continued to take money from--we took money from wherever we can get it but nobody, to the best of my knowledge, ever attempted to control the creative output of the Kuumba Theatre just because they gave us money.  If anybody had, I know what [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward] would have told them, and I know what I would have told them too.  The most that any of the funding sources ever did was to ask for certain paperwork; you know, to--reports on what we have done, how we had used the money and also the financial reports on how we'd spent the money.  We were able to do that.  So we never encountered any, any difficulty at all from any white funding source because of the money we took.  But the idea remained out there for some years after the first grants we got in the early 1970s.  This remained true, at least, among some--some of the activists in the African American community that the white money was tantamount to white control.
Story_ID: 227814
Speaker 1: Another thing I think I want to talk about during that same timeframe where I am now, in the 1970s, was in 1976, Mr. Johnson, [HistoryMaker] John H. Johnson, at the chief--the owner, the principal owner of Johnson that--of Ebony, Jet magazines.  He decided to discontinue the publication of Black World [Negro Digest] and he dismissed Hoyt [W.] Fuller as editor.  Well, some of us didn't like the idea, didn't like that, and we complained to Mr. Johnson, but also we thought that the work that Black World had done as a magazine should continue and so we got the idea, some of us, [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward] and I, were involved with a large group of people, [HistoryMaker] Abena Joan [P.] Brown at ETA [Creative Arts Foundation, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] was one.  She was probably was the most visible leadership figure, [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti was another one.  There were people in other cities, [HistoryMaker] Ramona Edelin in Washington, D.C.  I don't remember the names of all the others.  There were a number of activists types in Chicago [Illinois] and other cities who got the idea that we should launch a new magazine and that we needed to raise money to launch a new magazine to make Hoyt Fuller the editor of it, and that the new magazine would continue the work that Black World had done.  So we raised some money.  I don't remember the exact amounts, but there was enough money to launch a new magazine which had its first issue in 1977 that we called--wait a minute.  It was called Black World and--Black World International Journal of Black Thought, and it was based in Atlanta [Georgia] because Hoyt--Hoyt had grown up in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: First World?
Speaker 1: First World: An International Journal of Black Thought.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Yeah, First World.  And Hoyt was made the editor of it, and the effort, I have to say, was inconsistent.  The amount of money was raised was sporadic and never enough to really print enough copies of the magazine to get it distributed nationally the way we wanted.  Some issues did get out.  Some issues were published in 1977, '78 [1978] and '79 [1979].  I don't recall whether any issues were published in 1980.  There may have been, but Hoyt Fuller dropped dead of a heart attack in downtown Atlanta in the spring of 1981, and I think by then the magazine had at least discontinued publication for a time, although there was a plan to resume it.  But one of the, one of the reasons why the money that we raised was never adequate, was because the same issue surfaced among those who were active in trying to raise money for First World, that they didn't want to take any money from any white funding sources.  At that time, I was working for the Los Angeles Times bureau in Chicago, and I wanted to do a story on First World.  Well, people didn't even want me to do that.  They didn't, they didn't want any cooperation with whites at all.  The idea was prevalent among the board members of First World that the white money would be tantamount to white control and it would corrupt the whole effort if we took money from, from whites.  Well, I made the same argument.  I didn't think it was corrupt us at all.  Look, I thought we needed the money, and I thought that, that First World could have done the same thing that the Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] and the other organizations, as well could have done--that you could have maintained your integrity while taking money from anybody.  I mean, I thought it was possible to do that then.  I think it's possible to do that today.  But the majority members on the First World board were absolutely adamant.  They would not take a dime or wouldn't seek any money from any white funding source, and they were very adamant that they didn't want me to do anything in the pages of the other L.A. Times on this effort to launch a new magazine, so I didn't.  But I thought that that was one of the reasons.  There were other reasons, as well.  I thought that that had pretty much doomed the magazine, because it chronically lacked enough money to publish.  And Hoyt was willing at times to go without being paid, he was willing to make other sacrifices, you know, only to keep the magazine running, but because neither one of us was an expert in fundraising, I mean, nobody active with this group was an expert in fund raising, and nobody active with the group had ties to sources of money so that we can go and call somebody or write letters and in large amounts of money.  Some money came in from grants, some money came in from small fund raising activities we had, some people gave money out of their pockets.  I remember there was a loan to some of us that made from South Shore Bank [ShoreBank, Chicago, Illinois].  I think the amount was twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars that helped to pay the expenses of the magazine.  And Hoyt, Hoyt worked out of his house.  We didn't have, you know, an office.  So the issues of the magazine that did get published, you know, were published, you know, on a shoestring but even the shoestrings, you know, eventually ran out.  But I still feel today that, that--I don't know if First World would have continued until now, but I think that it could have lasted well beyond the, the late 1970s had we gone out and sought large amounts of money and had we accepted money from anybody, and I thought we could have maintained the integrity of the magazine no matter what the funding source was.
Story_ID: 227815
Speaker 1: There's a couple quick questions.  First of all, it was alleged, I know, by [HistoryMaker John H.] Johnson that the reason why Black World [Negro Digest] was discontinued was because it wasn't making money.  Is this really true?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  Only Mr. Johnson would know.  I think he did say that, that it was not profitable.  I tend to doubt if that was Mr. Johnson's real reasoning.  I don't think Black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  But it was widely read--
Speaker 2: --I don't think Black World ever made, if it made a profit at all, it never made a big profit.  And I think that all the years that--'cause Negro Digest had been the first magazine established by John H. Johnson in 1942, and for all the years that it ran as first Negro Digest and then Black World, I think he carried it then as a service to itself leadership.  I don't think he ever expected it to make much money, and it certainly made nowhere near the kind of money that Ebony magazine made or that Jet magazine made, so that if that was his reason I think Mr. Johnson, perhaps, changed his mind, you know, later on and then he perhaps at some point began to have profit expectations from Black World the way he did with Ebony and Jet magazine, but I don't think it ever was a big money making magazine.  You know, it didn't carry that much advertising, the readership was never that great, and so, you know, if he expected it to make money than I think that was something that was fairly new at the time that the magazine was discontinued.  That had not been the practice, you know, back in the 1960s, especially, when I first joined the company in 1965.  There was no thought at that time that the then Negro Digest, you know, would be a money maker.
Story_ID: 227816
Speaker 1: Well, do you think there's anything credible about any of the reasons that floated around as to why he [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] canceled it [Black World; Negro Digest].  I mean, because there are different alternative reasons (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I never did any personal investigation.  I never talked to Mr. Johnson about that, and I don't know if any of us ever, ever did.  Those of us who helped to launch the First World[: An International Journal of Black Thought] magazine tended to doubt Mr. Johnson's reason, but we didn't, we didn't make a big fuss about it.  Our feeling was that if that's what he wanted to do, he owned it, he had the right to do that as owner.  So that if we wanted to launch a new magazine that would be independent and which would be forthright then we should kind of get behind that and put our money where our mouths were, so to speak.  That we should, we should make an effort to launch a magazine that would be truly independent that could editorially do what we thought a magazine of that kind should do.  So I think our focus was not so much in trying to pick a fight with Mr. Johnson publicly, but just to try to get behind the effort to launch the new magazine, First World, which at least in theory would be like Black World but only would become a journal on the arts and on the creative activity, but it would always become an advocacy journal, as well.  I remember one of the articles I did an issue for First World, I think it was in 1977, was titled "Black Youth: An Endangered Species," and that phrase, 'A Endangered Species' sort of began to resonate with others.  The idea behind my article [sic. editorial] was that during the 1970s, black young people indeed seemed to be regarded as endangered, because it--it was the time of law and order, lock up everybody, you know, harsh drug laws and the--this was kind of part of the conservative reaction that was sweeping the country at the time that eventually led to the election of [President] Ronald [Wilson] Reagan in 1980.  Well, during the 1970s, there was no effort spared to make laws more punitive, to lock up people, you know, on almost any pretext, and the jails became filled with black young people.  But coupled with this, black young males particularly, coupled with this was the idea that the American economy itself was offering less and less opportunity that the old entry level jobs that were available to young people just out of high school were no longer there.  So on the one hand, we had an increasing tendency to lock up young black males, on the other hand the economy offered them less and less opportunities.  So I saw this as a dangerous trend where the future of young black males, you know, was less and less certain.  So that's why I chose the theme of my article, 'An Endangered Species,' because the future of black young people were very much uncertain at the time, you know, if this trend continued and if the conservatism of, of the predominant prevailing political philosophy in the country at the time if that continued, I had very serious doubts about what the future of a whole generation of black youths would be, and that's what I tried to express in the article that I wrote.
Story_ID: 227817
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you want to talk about NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] now?
Speaker 2: Well, I want to talk about the, the career in journalism and, and my own philosophy.  I left Ebony magazine in December of 1967, and I began working as a general assignment reporter with the Chicago Sun-Times in January of 1968.  I was one of the first--I wasn't the first, but I was one of the first black reporters who worked for the paper.  There was, to the best of my knowledge, one another black reporter worked with me at the Sun-Times at that time, a man by the man of Earl Moses who was covering the criminal courts.  And I remained with the Sun-Times about a year and-a-half.  And in July of 1969, I was hired as a correspondent in the Midwest bureau of the L.A. Times, the Los Angeles Times is a nationally recognized daily newspaper in established bureaus in cities around the country.  It already had a Chicago [Illinois] bureau, and so I was hired to work in the Chicago bureau.  And for about eight and-a-half years I worked with the L.A. Times all the time in Chicago, and I covered, oh, a number of stories and cities around the country, but particularly in the Midwest like Cleveland [Ohio], and Detroit [Ohio], and Minneapolis [Minnesota] and St. Louis [Missouri].  I remember among the many stories that I wrote, I went to Cleveland, wrote a story about Carl Stokes how he'd been elected the mayor of Cleveland.  I wrote stories about the election of Coleman [A.] Young as the first [African American] mayor of Detroit in 1973.  I wrote a number of stories.  Not all of them, you know, based upon race.  As a matter of fact, the majority of the stories I did for the L.A. Times had no racial angle at all.  But one of the things I wanted to do and the personal philosophy that I tried to follow as a reporter working with the mainstream white newspaper was I wanted to give access to black people for the paper, 'cause at that time, most mainstream papers didn't write that much about what was going on with black people.  Well, I wanted to change that.  I didn't want to be strictly a reporter who only wrote about racial issues, but I wanted to include in the mix of stories that I did enough about what was going on with black people so that African Americans would have a much greater access to the pages of the L.A. Times than they had before.  Now, the L.A. Times was predominately white, it was a conservative newspaper.  It endorsed [President] Ronald [Wilson] Reagan twice for governor of California in 1966 and 1970.  And it had a predominantly white leadership.  They had, for the most part, were not that enthusiastic about stories with a racial angle, but I felt that what I was able to get in the paper and what I could get in the paper, and what I could get them to accept, I should do that.  And I understood the limits of the L.A. Times.  I understood that there were limits to what they would do in this regard.  But I thought that my job as a reporter was to push the limits and to gain as much as access to stories that otherwise probably would never get in the L.A. Times at all and might never get printed at all.  And that was the way that I wanted to conduct myself as a reporter, 'cause I felt that I had a social obligation being in this position to do as much as I could to provide as much as access as I could and tell stories that other reporters were going to do but wouldn't be inclined to do all.  I remember I wrote a story about the Congress of Afrikan People [CAF] that had a big convention in Atlanta [Georgia] in 1970 that hardly any of the mainstream press did.  I did an extensive amount of writing about the killing of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark, the two Black Panther [Party] leaders, as you remember, who were killed in this--following a police raid on December 4, 1969.  I wrote a number of stories about that.
Story_ID: 227818
Speaker 1: I helped to organize the first black journalists in Chicago [Illinois].  It was called United Black Journalists [Chicago Association of Black Journalists] and later on I was one of the forty-four African American journalists who organized the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ] in Washington, D.C. in 1975.  And I've remained an active member of the NABJ, you know, since then.  I was the first vice president of it, and I, you know, I've been active in attempts to organize black journalists in Miami [Florida] where I worked, in Washington, D.C., and my feeling was that I thought that the NABJ was a good idea.  I thought that its focus then as now was good because an effort should be made to enhance the number of African Americans working in mainstream journalism but also to, efforts to cut down on the amount of institutional racism that remained, you know, as part of the American press.  And I think, you know, to some extent we were successful in doing that.  I remained with the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times], until January 1978, and after that, I accepted a job with the Miami Herald as a reporter and columnist and first time I ever worked in South Florida.  I went to Miami [Florida] and worked there for two years and wrote a weekly column for the Miami Herald, as well as doing some reporting for the newspaper.  And in January of 1980, I took a job with a TV station in Washington, D.C.  An old friend of mine named George Foster who once with CBS News had become the general manager of a new TV station in Washington, D.C. called WHMM [TV; WHUT-TV, Channel 32, Washington, D.C.] that was owned and operated by Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Now, 1980, the station was trying to get on the air.  It wasn't on the air yet, but the station did own the license.  And so George enticed me to come to Washington and for, for the TV station.  And he had big ideas of this becoming a news station and having a news operation, ideas which never really, really materialized.  But I did come to Washington and take the job, and wound up, you know, learning something about television production and being a writer and producer with this TV station.
Story_ID: 227819
Speaker 1: And in January of 1970--1984, I left Washington [D.C.] and returned to Chicago [Illinois] to take a job in the mayor's press office at [Chicago] City Hall [Chicago, Illinois].  This was in the administration of [Mayor] Harold Washington who had been elected as the first black mayor of Chicago in April of 1983.  Well, Harold's first press secretary was [HistoryMaker] Grayson Mitchell who was an old friend of mine from the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times].  He and I both had worked together on the L.A. Times, and Grayson's deputy press secretary was another friend of mine, Chris Chandler, whom I had met, and we had become friends from our days with the Chicago Sun-Times in 1968 and 1969, so I knew both Chris Chandler and Grayson Mitchell, and both of them enticed me to come back and accept this opening in the mayor's press office on the mayor's press staff, and that would also give me a chance to reunite with the family, because all the time I had been in Miami [Florida] and in Washington, I had been separated.  The family had remained in Chicago, and I was in Miami and also in Washington.  So I kind of liked the idea of returning, you know, to Chicago to reunite with the family, so that we wouldn't have, sort of, commuter marriage that [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward] and I had maintained for about six years.  So, at any rate, I worked on the press staff at city hall under first Harold Washington and then later on under [HistoryMaker] Eugene Sawyer.  You may recall the day in the life of Chicago politics, November 25, 1987 when Harold Washington dropped dead at his desk of heart attack.  That was a day that stunned all of us, and it was a day that will live in the political history of the City of Chicago.  Well, the November 25, I remember it very well, it was a Wednesday.  It was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, well, those--well, all of the city hall staff worked through the entire Thanksgiving holiday.  The--Harold Washington's body lay in state in city hall that weekend, that Friday and Saturday, and the following Monday, December 1st, there was a meeting in city hall of the Chicago City Council, the purpose of which was to name an interim mayor.  And that was, you may recall, the very contentious meeting that went on until the early A.M. hours of the following Tuesday in which--during which Eugene Sawyer finally became sort of a compromise candidate of the city council, and he was named mayor.  Well, those were very bitter days and rancorous days--
Story_ID: 227820
Speaker 1: Death of [Mayor] Harold Washington and the emergence of [HistoryMaker] Eugene Sawyer sort of split the Harold Washington coalition into different parts.  There was some people who had supported Harold who supported Eugene Sawyer, there were other people who had supported Harold who were bitterly opposed to Eugene Sawyer because they thought that he was a tool of the white aldermen who had also become--had been bitterly opposed to Harold Washington all the time that Harold had been mayor.  He had served one full term and had been reelected in April 1987 for a second four year term.  And it was about five months into the second four-year term that he collapsed and died.  Well, I had sort of a personal quandary about that.  I wasn't certain whether what I had heard about Eugene Sawyer was true or not.  So I kind of wondered whether I should remain here or whether I should seek another job, so I talked it over with [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward] and then I talked it over with Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II], my old friend from early days in Chicago [Illinois], when he was with the Chicago Daily News later on with his own newspaper, called the Black Express.  And Lu said that he didn't have good advice to offer, he said that I just had to sort of reach the decision that I thought was best, and my wife said the same thing.  And I thought it over, and my decision was that I thought I would at least give this a try.  That I thought that Eugene Sawyer should be given a chance.  I didn't think that he was a Uncle Tom or I didn't think that that he was a tool of the white, of the white aldermen.  You know, I wasn't certain that that wasn't true, but I thought he should be given the benefit of the doubt.  And in retrospect, I think that that was the right decision to make.  I worked for Sawyer from December 1987 up until the time of the special election in February 1989 when he was defeated by Richard M. Daley.  And during the time I was there, I didn't--I never got the impression that he was a tool of the, of the white enemies of the Harold Washington, because almost everything that Sawyer did as its own program was a continuation of the Harold Washington program, and Sawyer retained all of the staff members, all of the department heads and all of the staff members, you know, who wanted to remain.  Some of them decided, you know, that they would leave, but most of them continued.  He retained all of the staff members and he continued, essentially, the same Harold Washington program, so that convinced me that he, in fact, you know, was not a tool of the white aldermen and I tended to disagree with those who were vocal in their criticism.  One of the vocal critics of Eugene Sawyer was my good friend at the time [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett.  He and I happened to disagree about that and Vernon and I never had much--we had some brief conversations about that.  But he had one view of Sawyer.  He was still suspicious of Eugene's Sawyer motives, but I never did.  When I left city government in May of 1989, I was convinced that I had made the right decision to stay on, you know, and worked in the Sawyer administration, but at that time I was ready to leave.  I didn't want to continue in city government.  I don't think I would have continued government in city government if Harold Washington had been elected to a third term.  I think I would be ready to, to leave city government.  And I was happy to leave, you know, when I did.  The incoming administration, the first press secretary that Richard Daley retained was a black woman by the name of [HistoryMaker] Avis LaVelle who had been a news reporter for WGN News [WGN, Chicago, Illinois] and she and I knew each other.  And she and I had a brief conversation, you know, I think after she had, maybe, the first or second day, you know, she took over as press secretary.  And, I think, she told me in so many words that I was not one of those who would be retained by the new administration.  And I told her that was fine, no hard feelings.  I was ready to leave city government anyways, so we left on good terms.

Speaker 1: So I spent the summer teaching--well, not the entire summer.  Part of the summer of 1989 teaching at Northwestern [University] Medill School of Journalism [Evanston, Illinois] making a little money.  I also, for the first time, drew some unemployment checks during that time.  And later on that fall, I think it was around September or October I got a phone call from a lady at Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York] asking me if I was interested in coming there to apply for an opening on the faculty at the journalism school [S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications] at Syracuse University.  I told her I was.  The lady, her name was Nancy Sharp, and she had met my son coincidentally, it was a chance meeting between her and my son as both of them were traveling through the [Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International] Airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: Babatu [Ward].  His name--his given name was Zachary, but he use the African name Babatu.  Babatu had traveled down to Bahamas on an assignment with a good friend of ours named Ron Boyd [ph.] and both of them, Ron and Babatu, were traveling back through the Fort Lauderdale airport.  I think it was September 1989 when they had to bump into Nancy Sharp with her husband and her daughter and they struck up a conversation, and the conversation eventually led to Babatu mentioning to Nancy Sharp that me, his father, was out of job and he was looking for one and he had a background in journalism.  So Nancy got interested in that, and Babatu exchanged phone numbers.  So Nancy Sharp later called me and asked me if I would be interested in interviewing with the people at Syracuse University.  I told them, yes, I would.  So I went up to Syracuse, I think, it was the first week in October 1989.  I remember this very well, because it was the same time when they had the big earthquake out in San Francisco [California].  It was a time when the San Francisco Giants played the Oakland A's and had the earthquake at Candlestick Park [San Francisco, California] and had to cancel the World Series.  And, apparently, I made a good impression on them, because they offered me the job right away, and I started the following January in 1990, and that was the first--and I have been at Syracuse University, the Newhouse School of Public Communication ever since January of 1990 on faculty there, and I've enjoyed very much, and Nancy Sharp and I, have developed a close friendship and close working relationship.  She's still on the faculty.  I was only the second black full-time faculty hired at the Newhouse School of Public Communications.  The first had been a black professor who had been hired in 1975.  But from 1975 to 1990, they hadn't hired any blacks, so I was the second black to be hired and since then, three, three other blacks had been hired, you know, as full-time faculty members at the Newhouse School.

Speaker 1: In teaching journalism, I try to teach journalism using the same philosophy that I had followed as a working journalist.  I believe then and I believe now, that journalism is primarily a public service.  Its primary can't be to make money for the companies that own the newspapers or that own the TV stations.  That the first obligation of journalist is to citizens and that journalism has a crucial role to play in the building and the development of a democratic system.  And I think that the first obligation of journalists is to report information that people need to be active citizens in a democratic society.  And that's what I teach in my classes.  I teach mainly news writing courses, courses in journalism ethics, courses in journalism history.  And in the courses of journalism history that I teach, I draw very much on my own experience as a working journalist with [Chicago] Sun-Times, with Ebony and Jet, with the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] and the Miami Herald.  And I also draw upon the experience I had working in city government.  I been there since 1990.  I'm now in my fifteenth year at the [S.I.] Newhouse School of Public Communications [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York], and find it to be very challenging, very demanding and also very rewarding.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm concerned about--well, in this sense, I'm concerned about the whole country, not just the African American community, but the culture personality, the worship of celebrities.  I think that this worship celebrities and holding up celebrities as role models is wrong and counterproductive.  I never believed that athletes or singers or dancers were role models at all.  I always thought that the best role models were good parents who did a good job of rearing their children, and I hold my own parents [Effie Crawford Ward and Jefferson Ward] up as the best role models I ever could have had.  I don't think any athlete or celebrity would ever come close to my parents, or even perhaps your parents as good role models.  I don't think a role model is somebody who just happened to succeed and make a lot of money.  A role model is someone who has--who demonstrates a belief in values and whose life you want to emulate because you believe deeply in the way that person lives his life and the kinds of values that motivate that person's life.  Well, that's a role model for me.  Well, that's not most athletes and not most entertainers, and I think it was very wrong for even for people in the country to have this idea that anybody in the public eye is a role model.  You know, if you're an athlete, if you're an entertainer, if you're in the public eye, if you're a newscaster, if you're in the public eye, you become a role model.  I mean, I think that's nonsense.  It's idiotic, and so the way that we worship celebrities these days and follow behind them and look up to them, I think is wrong and counterproductive.  I think there are a lot of other people whom we ought to look up to whom we perhaps don't.  I still believe that the folks we ought to emulate and model our lives after are good parents who do a good job of rearing their children.
Story_ID: 227824
Speaker 1: I think that, you know, in terms of African Americans, I think, that, you know, that the Civil Rights Movement is still active and it should be.  I think that it's a mistake to think that because we made gains in terms of housing and education and other ways that the struggle for equal rights is over.  I don't think the struggle will ever be over; certainly not in our lifetime.  I think the struggle for identity, for economic empowerment should go on and it's a mistake to listen to the small handful of black conservatives out here who keep wanting to say that we should forget about race and that we should go on and, and do other things, you know.  I don't think we should ever forget about where we came from.  We should never forget about the struggles of the past, we should always be indebted to people, you know, in the past who had waged the struggle to bring us to where we are now to achieve whatever degree of economic and cultural parity that we have achieved.  I have some concerns about certainly about the extent of drug use in the African American community, the extent of the AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] epidemic that affects the African American community, and I think that if it's one of the things I can be thankful for in my own life and in in my wife's [HistoryMaker Val Gray Ward] life the way we have led it, is that we never used drugs at all, any drugs of any kind, and we've reared our children, you know, to be that way.  Now, I can't speak for every one of my children, but I do think that--well, I can say with confidence that we are happy today that all them are grown and with lives of their own and in no way to the best of our knowledge are involved with any kind of drug use or anything associated with drug use, and I think that at least the parents we've been, you know is at least partly responsible for that.  One of the things I'm proud of, but I think, you know, that drug use to continue to decay of the black family, I think a promise that we as a society must continue to work on and must continue to find solutions to them.  I think that the efforts to build black communities to gain greater and greater political empowerment, to gain greater and greater economic empowerment, I think these efforts have to go on.  And I think, you know, they have to be central to the way we lead our lives and the way that we organize ourselves politically and socially.
Story_ID: 227825
Speaker 1: Okay.  One thing I wanted to point out that other people might not know, having known you for years, I know that when you married [HistoryMaker] Val Gray Ward, you inherited a family of children already there.  Was it four or five?
Speaker 2: That's right.  Yeah, over the years, we've taken in some children and not officially, but, but kind of unofficially adopted them as part of our own family, you know.
Speaker 1: As well as her natural children and other children?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And members of the [Kuumba] Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] company have become an extended family and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  That's right and still are regarded as part of our extended family today.
Speaker 1: Right.  I mean, you know, I'm just privy to know that the--your sons and daughters have a profound respect for you and call you [HistoryMaker] Daddy Francis [Ward]--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --with a lot of affection, which is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  And I have an equal amount of affection for them.  And I do want to say, you know, that we have five children, five grandchildren.  One of the grandchildren unfortunately died a tragic death in April of 1999, but we still have five grandchildren and we have two great-grandchildren of whom I am very proud.
Speaker 1: Right.  And they're all achieving and doing something good, you know--
Speaker 2: They're all leading productive--the children and the grandchildren--the great-grandchildren are still very young but we have high hopes that they too one day will lead very productive and fulfilling lives.
Speaker 1: But did you have any trepidation before you got married about inheriting such a large family and that number of children (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Well, it was something I thought about--
Speaker 1: --and the second part of this is how do you do it?  How were you able to do it?
Speaker 2: Well, because there was a great deal of compatibility between me and Val when we got married in January 1966.  I did have some thought about that, and at first, I did have some doubts, but I eventually got over the doubts and I've never regretted it, you know.  The children that she had, you know, which eventually became my children, I reared as my children and have never looked back.  And then, oh, I think, I got over, you know, the initial reservations after the first year of the marriage and since then, I've never had any doubts about, you know, whether that was the wisest decision to make.
Story_ID: 227826
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back on all the things you've done in different fields; arts administration, you're writing polemic pieces, you're doing journalism, teaching and television, all these things.  Is there anything major that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure that there's anything I'd do differently.  I guess one of the biggest regrets I've had is that I haven't been able to get the book published that I wrote about the [Mayor] Harold Washington years.  I began a manuscript in 1995, and I finished it in early 1997, and since then I've shopped it around to various publishers and none of the publishers either in Chicago [Illinois] or elsewhere, you know, would accept it, you know, for publication.  That's one of my biggest regrets.  I still would like to get this book published 'cause I don't think I have read anything to date that is as comprehensive in terms of explaining the whole set of events that led to the election of Harold Washington in 1983 and which explain in some detail his accomplishments and also some of his failures while he was mayor from April 1983 until his death in November 25, 1987.  But in terms of the other things I've done, I don't have any regrets.  I don't think there's anything major or substantive in life that I can think of that I would have done differently, or I wish I could go back and do it all over again, no.
Story_ID: 227827
Speaker 1: In regard to the book, what do you think are [Mayor] Harold Washington's major accomplishments and, I mean and his administration, it wasn't just him, but--
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I think of his major accomplishments I think he genuinely was a reformer who wanted to change directions for Chicago [Illinois] politics.  When he was elected, there were, oh, critics who doubted at all that he was, he was sincere in his effort to reform Chicago, because, you know, Chicago politics has a history of, of, of corruption and also a history of systemic racism, and sexism as well.  And I think Harold Washington did want to make a fundamental change in the way politics was practiced in Chicago.  And I think my book was dedicated to that premise.  I suspect to this day, that one of the reasons why publishers were reluctant to accept this book for publication was because the majority opinion among whites in Chicago was very different.  That the Harold Washington years were pretty much a washout and a waste of time, and that nothing substantive actually got done, and my book takes the opposite point of view.  And I think they felt that had they published my book, the publishing company and the book would have been put on, on the defensive because there were so many other--so many people in Chicago who had a different--different view of the Harold Washington years, but I remain convinced that this was one of the most important periods ever in the political history of the City of Chicago.  And my book, was sort of dedication, you know, to that theme.  Now, I think Harold Washington brought a greater sense of ethics to city government.  I don't mean that his administration was entirely free of any corruption because it was not.  Because some of the people who worked on the Harold Washington eventually were convicted and went to jail.  But I think that on balance, his practice--the way he ran city government was cleaner than it had been before.  And I think that the current mayor of Chicago, [Mayor] Richard [M.] Daley, took up some of the initiatives that Harold Washington began and took them further than even Harold did.  The initiative on minority set asides, for instance.  Richard Daley went further with that, and made it law, but Harold Washington only had it as an executive order.  I think the ethics in government is stronger now today only because of the initiatives that Harold Washington began, you know, when he was mayor.  So while his, I guess, term and five months certainly were not perfect, I think he set a new direction for politics in Chicago and a new tone.  I think that if there was one single achievement that we could credit him with, that was, I think, he finally broke the back and the, and the systemic power of the old Chicago machine.  The machine had been dominant, as you know, in the selection of mayors in Chicago, and all the machine's power had begun to wane in the 1970s.  It was still very formidable in the early 1980s at the time when Harold Washington ran.  But I think he was able to defeat the machine in such a way that its, that its substantive power was broken finally, and that the hold it had on Democratic Party politics in Chicago was finally broken to the point where it was no longer the dominant force that it had been under [Mayor] Jane Byrne and under [Mayor] Michael Bilandic and under [Mayor] Richard J. Daley, you know, the father of the present mayor.  So think if--I think that there are other many accomplishments of Harold Washington, but if there is one that I think is fundamentally most important and far reaching, it's that.  It's breaking the power of the old machine.
Story_ID: 227828
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wanted to go back to something you said about corruption.  And correct me if I'm wrong, and fill in the gaps, but I think there was only--I think there are some alderman convicted of corruption and went to jail (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Yeah, there were some people, you know--
Speaker 1: --that weren't necessarily--
Speaker 2: --the U.S. attorney in Chicago [Illinois] launched a long range investigation of the [Mayor Harold] Washington administration.  They found some aldermen who had been on the take who had accepted bribes.  One of Harold's best friends, a man by the name of Clarence McClain was eventually convicted and sent to prison for accepting some bribes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That may be the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Some people made the--or some of Harold Washington's critics made the argument that Harold Washington couldn't be regarded as a new reformer because he maintained his friendship with an old-style machine politician like Clarence McClain.  But the McClain's friendship, though it was a friendship and Harold continued to talk to McClain, McClain had almost no influence on the administration.  He lasted in the administration only about five months.  He was director of freedom of information, which was like a political job, and he lasted there only five months and then he left the administration thereafter.  So his influence on the administration was minimal at best.  His influence on Harold Washington's direction was minimal at best, and I don't mean to suggest that McClain was guilty of everything that he was accused of.  You know, I'm sure that, that a lot of the advice he offered Harold Washington was very good that Harold found useful.  But McClain's reputation was such that Harold Washington's critics would use the Clarence McClain reputation as a way to tarnish Harold Washington, and I think that was one thing that I--one, one of the lies that I tried to dispel in the book that I wrote.  Only I should say, the manuscript, because the book still to this day has never been published.
Story_ID: 227829
Speaker 1: I know that you do have some critique of [Mayor] Harold Washington, too.  You didn't always think that everything there was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Well, yes, I thought Harold on balance was a good mayor.  I thought the direction he set for the city [Chicago, Illinois] was good, but I didn't think he was a God who should be worshipped, and I thought he was open to criticism from time to time like any other mayor, like any other politician.  And I thought one of the things that he should have been criticized for, or that we should understand about him, was that he had a tendency when--he had a tendency to use people and then kind of discard them and cast them aside, you know, once--when he felt their usefulness was over.  And I think the best example of that was the relationship between him and Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II], my good friend who recently passed away.  Lu Palmer, I think, was singly most responsible for the movement that helped to draft Harold Washington as a candidate for mayor back in early 1982--or back in, I think, it was late 1982.  I think it was the fall or winter when this draft movement sort of took root (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had the (unclear) sites and churches and so forth.
Speaker 2: --and I think when the idea first got implanted in the minds of people, Harold, then, was an Illinois state senator and a good politician.  I think, you know, a reform minded Illinois state senator, but he, at first, was hesitant, you know, to, to accept this draft movement, and I think it was Lu Palmer and his wife, Jorja English [HistoryMaker Jorja Palmer], who helped to persuade him to eventually become a candidate in the Democratic Party primary in February 1983, which he won; which eventually set the stage for the general election in April 1983, which Harold also won.  But after Harold was elected in April 1983, the relationship between him and Lu Palmer, instead of, you know, blossoming out and becoming greater, sort of disintegrated because in my discussions with Lu Palmer, and I had a long conversation with, with Lu about this.  He said that Harold never called him; Harold never thanked him; Harold never expressed any thanks at all.  For--never offered him a job.  Not that Lu actually sought a job.  He never said that he sought a job in the administration, but he said that Harold never thanked him or never showed any appreciation at all for the work that Lu Palmer had done in getting the draft Harold Washington movement off the ground.  And he had some resentment for that, and I think understandably so.  I remember Lu describing to me one conversation that he said he and Harold where--I don't remember the verbatim words, but essentially the conversation came down to, you know, I don't need you now, and Harold--from Harold to Lu.  And Harold saying that he didn't owe Lu Palmer anything, and that he didn't think he had to do anything, he didn't think he had to thank--had to show any thanks or any appreciation at all.  Well, in my opinion, this was indicative of one part of Harold Washington's personality in which, you know, he tended to use people when they were useful and then cast them aside, you know.  And there were other people whom I talked to who knew Harold Washington very well, who tended to agree with this that he thought mostly about himself.  That he was a very self-absorbed person, who was very absorbed, you know, in his own career and that he didn't think that he needed to thank people for what they had, you know, to either get him elected as mayor or for work to help him sustain his role or to sustain himself once he got elected.
Story_ID: 227830
Speaker 1: Also, I think that a major mistake--that [Mayor] Harold [Washington] made a major mistake once he became mayor in April 1983.  I think that instead of solidifying his power and organizing his power base, I think he became more absorbed in what I regard as the celebrity aspect of the job.  You know, going out and--going out to public events and meeting people and hearing all of the adoring praise that people had for him.  I always--I worked in the mayor's press office, and one of the essential functions of the mayor's press office was to prepare what we call briefing notes; that is a summary of things that Harold needed to do or say when he went out and made a public appearance.  And throughout the time that he was mayor, he would make anywhere from five to seven public appearances every day.  Well, I used to wonder how could you spend much time running things at [Chicago] City Hall [Chicago, Illinois] if you are out speaking at a church or this rally or this appearance, and his idea was that to a very large extent, he would leave the running of the day-to-day operations of city government to his chief of staff, and that it would leave him free to go out and do the things that he liked to do best, that is to go out and meet and talk to people and be the celebrity mayor.  And I thought that that was a mistake.  I don't think that he took enough steps to organize his base when he was elected.  I don't think he took enough steps to organize this political office which would sort of carry on the principles of the Washington movement and which would keep the political activism of the Harold Washington movement alive for a second term.  I think that the political office, such as it existed, was allowed to sort of disintegrate, because Harold, I think, he, if not suspicious, he didn't have much confidence in grooming people as a successor, he didn't have much confidence in building a movement that would succeed him.  I think he saw--he saw himself as kind of, of a lifelong figure, and he saw himself as kind of a mayor whose popularity would carry him over into a second term, and perhaps into a third term.  I think that his election in 1987 was based upon the same kind of sentiment that had existed in 1983, but there was not a strong political movement that would carry forth the ideals of the Harold Washington election in place in 1987, which I think could have been had Harold Washington attempted to build it.  I think there was too much of the celebrity aspect of the job.  I think he spent too much time on public appearances, and I'm convinced to this day that many of the public appearances he made were--had nothing to do with advancing his political agenda, had nothing to do with enhancing his popularity.  Oh, he'd go to any little church, any little storefront church, any little any event, you know, where people would gather and, you know, would sort of, you know, gather around and sort of enhance his popularity.  And I thought there was--it was far too many public appearances.  And far too many of them that had nothing to do with advancing the agenda he had as mayor at city hall.
Story_ID: 227831
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on all the things that you've been able to accomplish up to this point, and even as you attempt to publish this book, what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't even know if I have a legacy.  The things that I want to leave in the minds of people as I retire and eventually go on, as all of us eventually will, are the ideals of journalism as public service, the social obligations of black people to their communities, the need for people to get involved in their communities, the need to continue to work to build economic empowerment, political empowerment.  The kinds of ideals that I've tried to practice both as a husband and as a father and as a journalist, I want to see continue and I would like to see them implanted in the minds of other people.  One of the things I like about being a teacher, is that if I am successful in implanting any of these ideas in the minds of people who will eventually become journalists, and I think that I have, I think that's one thing that I'm very proud of.  So it is--I still believe that the principles that [HistoryMaker] Val [Gray Ward] and I espouse as leadership figures in the Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] are valid enacted.  I still believe very much that art for art's sake is a decadent idea that I think that art can both entertain and teach, I still very firmly believe that.  And I think that I would like to find ways for these ideas to live and continue and be sustained in future generations of people; both African American and whites and others.  So to the extent that there is any legacy, and I'm not sure that there is, it's the ideas that I fought for and have tried to implement it--try to implement both as a teacher, as a journalist, as a husband and as a father.  I would like for those ideas to continue.
Story_ID: 227832
Speaker 1: And what advice would you give aspiring black journalists today.  I mean, young people trying to get in the profession (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Be the best journalist you can, be the most committed journalist you can, learn as much as you can about other people, other cultures.  Work as hard as you can to foster the notion of journalism as public service, not journalism as entertainment or not journalism for the benefit of the companies that own.  One of the troubling trends in journalism today is that most of the news organizations; the newspapers, the magazines, the radio and TV stations, the news networks are owned by the big multinational conglomerates that are most--that are more interested in making money than they are in doing public service journalism.  It is because I think of this new trend and ownership that journalism more and more today has become more tabloid than anything else.  We spend more time on Michael Jackson and Kobe Bryant than we do reporting things that ought to be things of value to people.  We spend more time on entertainment journalism, you know, doing worthless feature stories on entertainers who haven't made any, any kind of contribution nor either to the music or to their communities.  Every time some little rap singer puts a CD out, you know, he gets a cover story somewhere and it's celebrated as some major figure when this person is barely out of his teens, you know, and is barely, you know, in adulthood and doesn't even know what it means to accept responsibility for what he does or even to accept responsibility for being a good person, a good parent; let alone, a good entertainer.  So I think there's far too much celebrity journalism on television, there's far too much in the magazines.  And I think this kind of celebrity tabloid trend has infected far too much the legitimate news organizations.  I'm talking about The New York Times, The Washington Post, the network news, CNN.  All of them, I think even they spend too much time on the celebrity tabloid-type journalism trends when they ought to be devoted much more to serious news.  News that elevates people, that educates people, news that is designed to help people be functioning members of a democratic society that helps to build democratic institutions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last--is there anything that we haven't asked that you want to address that we haven't talked about?
Speaker 2: I don't think there's anything that we have not covered, you know, in this interview that I would like to add to it, no.
Story_ID: 227833
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: If I'm remembered at all, I'd like to be remembered as a good journalist who believed in people, as a good husband and as a good father.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: All right.

Speaker 1: Okay.  That picture, I believe, was taken about twenty-five years ago during one brief period in my life when I didn't wear a beard.  It was a picture that was admired a great deal by my mother [Effie Crawford Ward], because she didn't like the idea that I wore a beard, and it's one picture that my wife [HistoryMaker Val Gray Ward] proudly uses to show how I used to look back, you know, in my early days.  I think it was taken around 1978 or 1979.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  That picture was taken during the summer of 1999 when I worked briefly for six weeks with the San Diego Union-Tribune, the daily newspaper, in San Diego, California.  This was--I was one of the of twenty-three journalism professors who were selected in a national program run by the American Society of Newspaper Editors [American Society of News Editors (ASNE)].  The American Society of Newspaper Editors had a program then and still has a program today in which it takes journalism professors and places them in an active newsroom for about six weeks to help enhance their skills, to upgrade their skills and to make sure that they are up to date on things that are currently going on at a newspaper.  This picture was taken on my last day at the Union-Tribune when the fellow employees gave me a little going away cake, and I think I was about to cut the cake when somebody snapped that picture.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, that's a picture of me and my youngest daughter, Rhonda.  Val and I have two daughters, as well as we have three granddaughters.  But this is Rhonda Underwood [ph.], my youngest daughter, and that's a picture that was taken, I believe, at Christmastime in the year, I believe, 1998.  Now, this is a picture of me and my wife, Val, at one of the functions of the Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], and I think this must have been sometime in the mid-1970s.  That's about the closest I can come.  I remember this was a Kuumba Theatre function, I think, perhaps at one of the receptions following one of the plays that we did.  But that's me to the right, and that's Val to my--well, to your left and to my immediate right in the picture.
Speaker 1: I think this is taken in a light moment, I think, you know, on Christmas Day, I think, at the same time in 1998 when we were opening gifts at my daughter's house, and somebody decided that, you know, this was a good time, you know, to snap a candid photo of me.
Speaker 2: You don't do a lot of grinning (laughter).
Speaker 1: And this is one where, where the person snapping the picture, you know, cut off part of the, the top of my head, but I think that's where I had just bought a--one of the sweatshirts that were at the convention of the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ].  I don't remember the year of that.  This may have been--it may have been in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in 1995 or it may have been in Phoenix [Arizona] in the year 2000.  I'm not sure what the year was here, but that's a NABJ sweatshirt that I have on.
