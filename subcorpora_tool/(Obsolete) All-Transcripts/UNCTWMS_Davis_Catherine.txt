Jennifer Donnally: Good afternoon. Today is August 17, 2011. It&#8217;s a lovely Wednesday afternoon in Stone Mountain, Georgia. I&#8217;m Jennifer Donnally, and it&#8217;s a little past 2:30 in the afternoon, and I&#8217;m here today to interview&#8212;why don&#8217;t you introduce yourself?
Catherine Davis: I am Catherine Davis, Catherine with a C, and I live here in Stone Mountain and have been living here for about seven years now.
JD: My first question to you is where did you grow up and what was your childhood like?
CD: I had a phenomenal childhood actually. I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, actually grew up in a housing project, but I didn&#8217;t know I was poor until I was well into college when I met some&#8212;. I mean I knew a lot of super rich people [Laughs] but I didn&#8217;t know specifically that my family was poor until I went to college and then I realized, &#8220; Oh, I guess they&#8217;re talking about me in some of these books.&#8221; [Laughs] But I had a phenomenal childhood. I grew up with two parents. My mom and dad were there all my life until they went home to be with the Lord. I have two sisters, I&#8217;m the middle child, and I have all of the middle child angst. [Laughs] But my childhood was wonderful, had lots of friends that lived in the projects with me, and back then Stamford didn&#8217;t have a lot of black people so the few black people that were there, we were pretty close, pretty connected. It wasn&#8217;t like it is today where you have a significant population of every culture. Back then it was pretty exclusive. It was whites, mostly Jewish, and then blacks, a few of us, and then there were of course white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.
JD: Did you go to public school systems?
CD: I am a product of the public school system, but back then&#8212;. Well the community that I grew up in valued education so I got an education through the public school system that I believe was equivalent to any private school. I believe that when I got out of high school I could stand toe to toe with any graduate of Choate or one of the other exclusive schools in Connecticut and I could hold my own because I was very well taught.
JD: Okay. So then you went on to college. Where did you attend college?
CD: T-u-f-t-s. I was a cheerleader. [Laughs] I went to Tufts in Medford, Massachusetts.
JD: And was there any big shock coming into college from your background?
CD: Not shocks, no. I did not like the culture of the university because it was set in a little town, Medford, and I didn&#8217;t know that there were just as many racists in Massachusetts as ever in Mississippi or Georgia or anywhere, so it was a little disconcerting when some of the white neighborhood kids would ride through and they&#8217;d see us and call us niggers and that kind of stuff. For that reason I graduated in three years instead of four because I absolutely loathed Medford, Massachusetts, but if I had transferred I would have lost too many credits, so I decided rather than lose the credits I would tough it out, but I accelerated my program so that I wouldn&#8217;t have to be there a full four years.
JD: And did you experience any racism when you were in Stamford, Connecticut, or were you pretty sheltered within the community?
CD: Well no, I grew up with lots of white kids. We didn&#8217;t&#8212;. I mean, yes, surface-ly there were some people that were idiots, but for the most part I was very well accepted. I had white friends and black friends. I had Filipino friends, I had Latino friends. It didn&#8217;t matter. What mattered more was what part of town you grew up in. So I grew up on the west side, didn&#8217;t quite get along with too many people from the east side or the south end, that kind of thing, but it wasn&#8217;t so much racial as it was territorial. But I certainly was aware. I mean you can&#8217;t live in America and not be aware of the racial issues that were going on.         My family is from Virginia and our family vacations was to go back to the homestead and see Uncle John and Aunt &#8217;Rene and those guys, and driving from Connecticut to Virginia was an exercise. To this day it is ingrained in me, when we would get to Maryland, to the Maryland House, that was the point of demarcation and that is when my parents would start telling us, okay, you can&#8217;t walk in the front door; you can&#8217;t drink from the soda fountain; you can&#8217;t&#8212;and so the list of can&#8217;ts came up. I didn&#8217;t have segregation or I don&#8217;t remember there being significant levels of segregation in Connecticut. I don&#8217;t remember that I couldn&#8217;t go to a white school&#8212;all the schools I went to were white&#8212;that I couldn&#8217;t drink from the same water fountain or any of that. I didn&#8217;t have that experience until we went on the family vacations. Even when we went to Philadelphia, which is where my mother&#8217;s people were, we didn&#8217;t have those experiences. It was only when we came to Virginia and we entered the segregated South that I really felt what it meant to be black in America.
JD: Then did you watch that change as you got older, because there were a lot of things that happened?
CD: Not so much change, because you can still feel some of that spirit even today. For example, I live in Stone Mountain. If you followed my street to the end you would be at the mountain, it&#8217;s that close, this Sheppard Street that you turned on. But I don&#8217;t go to Stone Mountain because the history there was that that&#8217;s where the Ku Klux Klan met. That&#8217;s where they burned crosses and lynched people and all kinds of things like that. So I still feel that but I do recognize the liberty that came with the signing of the Civil Rights Act of [19]64. There was a new liberty. I&#8217;m not going to call it freedom, because I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re free yet, but there was a new liberty that I had and that others around me had.
JD: So then what did you do? I mean you accelerated three years; that&#8217;s pretty impressive. Did you attend Tufts on an athletic scholarship as a cheerleader?
CD: Oh no, no, no, I got an academic scholarship.
JD: Okay.
CD: And I graduated magna cum laude in three years.
JD: Congratulations.
CD: [Laughs] Thank you.
JD: That&#8217;s hard to do when you&#8217;re also an athlete at the same time.
CD: Cheerleading was just something to do. It wasn&#8217;t like&#8212;. Back then it wasn&#8217;t like today. It wasn&#8217;t this whole, you know, you have to be an athlete to do it. They were begging for people [Laughs] to be on the cheering squad back then, and because we weren&#8217;t an NCAA kind of school&#8212;. [Telephone rings]
JD: I can pause it. Do you want me to pause it? [Break in recording] We&#8217;re back to recording again.
CD: Okay, what was I saying?
JD: You were talking about Tufts cheerleading&#8212;.
CD: Oh, yeah. We weren&#8217;t an NCAA school but we had a phenomenal basketball team, so I wanted to be out there cheering them on. That&#8217;s why I became a cheerleader. Our football team was terrible. I don&#8217;t even think we won a game the whole time. [Laughs] Our basketball team was pretty serious, it was pretty significant; so that&#8217;s why I became a cheerleader. I&#8217;m not an athletic type. I just did it because it was something to do in college, extracurricular activity kind of thing.
JD: So what did you do after you graduated?
CD: [Coughs] Excuse me. My very first job was with the Urban League of southwestern Fairfield County. [Coughs] They had gotten a grant to work with black youth who were not reading at or above grade level, and the object of the grant was to bring them at least up to grade level or above. So we did a significant after school program. We had a rigorous application process and we accepted a number of children, I don&#8217;t remember how many it was now, but we worked with them. We hired ten teenagers who were at the top of their class and we paid them, pretty significant money back then, to work with these youth, and we ordered all of the best educational projects that were out there to help you learn how to read, then we paired them with these tutors that would tutor them to help bring their reading scores to grade level, and we were successful.
JD: So was your undergraduate degree in education then?
CD: Education and psychology. I wanted to be a psychiatrist until I did an internship at Mass General [Massachusetts General Hospital] and there was this guy that really liked me and he would come every day at lunchtime and talk to me. And then one day one of the doctors came back from lunch early and saw him there and kind of smiled and said, &#8220;Hey, John, how are you doing? Time for you to go back to your room,&#8221; and then when they got him out of there I found out that he was an ax murderer that had been in there and he was still very volatile. Now he was really nice to me and I was like, whoa, if my discernment is that off I don&#8217;t need to be a psychiatrist. [Laughs] So that&#8217;s when I switched my major to education.
JD: So you got out and worked for the Urban League. I didn&#8217;t ask you this: Did you grow up in a political home?
CD: No. My mother was a domestic. She actually cleaned George W. Bush&#8217;s mommy and daddy&#8217;s house. [Laughs] Claim to fame. My mother was a domestic; my dad was a carpenter. But he was a carpenter at a time when the unions really didn&#8217;t recognize African Americans so they would let them do the work but they wouldn&#8217;t compensate them.
JD: Or get them the same wages.
CD: Right, at the same wages and protections, that&#8217;s correct. So they were not political at all. My mother was the neighborhood mother, so if you came over to my house and you weren&#8217;t dressed appropriately she was the mother that would tell you, &#8220;Okay, sweetie, let me help you.&#8221; [Laughs] If you hadn&#8217;t washed appropriately or your clothes were too short or you were wearing an inexpensive bra&#8212;. She told all my friends, she lined them up, and I was mortified: &#8220;Ma!&#8221; But she was like, the best two things you can ever invest in, I don&#8217;t care what you do for the rest of your life, I don&#8217;t care how rich you get or how poor you are, there are two things you must invest your money in: Bras, good, strong bras that are going to give you the support that you need, and shoes. [Laughs] And my friends to this day will tell you that my mother told them that, and how much they appreciated her telling them.
JD: Pretty true.
CD: Yeah, yeah, but she was the neighborhood mother. She was the woman that everybody in the neighborhood knew, if you were ever hungry all you had to do was go see Miss Mary. She would feed you. Some of our neighbors would come over to our house&#8212;you know how you go over to the neighbor&#8217;s house to borrow a cup of sugar&#8212;they would come and go grocery-shopping. They&#8217;d get a chicken and a box of rice and the whole nine yards and take it to feed their family. That was my mother. My dad, on the other hand, was very quiet and unless he threw a few back you really didn&#8217;t get the same, to know him like that, the same feel. But my mother was the neighborhood mother so all of the kids hung out at our house.         My dad was a gadget man so we were the first family to get a TV, we were the first family to get a color TV, and we were the first family to get the stereo. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen them but they used to be these huge pieces of furniture. [Laughs] We were the first family to get&#8212;. All of us had ten-speed bikes, I mean because my dad was the equivalent of today&#8217;s, you know, if there&#8217;s a new &#8220;smart phone&#8221; he would have had it [Laughs] because that was his thing and that&#8217;s what he enjoyed in life. One of the reasons why I never knew we were poor is because he was a gadget man, so all of the stuff, he had.
JD: Did you grow up in a churchgoing family?
CD: Yes. Back then, whether your parents went to church or not, you were going to church. If on a given Sunday my parents didn&#8217;t take me my godparents stepped in and they took me and if my godparents and my parents didn&#8217;t take me then one of the neighbors took me, but we were a churched family, as were all of the families in our neighborhood that I grew up with. All of the children, we were all in the classes together.
JD: What was the church?
CD: The church that we went to was Faith Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church. That&#8217;s where we went.
JD: I&#8217;m trying to think. What was I going to ask you next? I had a question with church and it just totally went out of my mind. [Laughs] Oh, I wanted to ask you, so you had a mother who was a domestic. She worked so both members of your family worked quite a bit.
CD: Yes.
JD: What were her days like?
CD: Well when we were little she would&#8212;they called it live-in help, so she would sleep at the home of whosever&#8217;s home it was. She would stay there all night but she would come home in the mornings, get us ready for school, get us out, cook dinner, and then she would go to sleep and then my dad would get home at like 4:00 and she would leave at 4:00 and go back to her domestic job where she cooked them dinner, got their kids all taken care of, and Dad put us to bed and did&#8212;. Well he didn&#8217;t do homework with us, he just told us, do your homework and we wouldn&#8217;t dare disobey. So they had a system worked out. When we got older where we didn&#8217;t need&#8212;.She could pretty much let us go and do, then that&#8217;s when she stopped doing the sleep in jobs and she worked pretty much during the day, generally got home around 4:00 and then took care of the family from there. My dad was a fisherman as well so he and his friends would go fishing and they would catch enough fish to pack my mother&#8217;s standup freezer for at least three months, and so lobster was not a delicacy to me because they put out lobster pots, or crabs was not a big deal because they would go crabbing. Then they would catch all these fish, the croakers and the spots and whatever, and we would eat tons of fish and the neighborhood would eat tons of fish because Daddy would go fishing and he generally would do it as soon as there was enough room to put more fish in the freezer, so...
JD: Ingenuity. [Laughs]
CD: Yes.
JD: Okay. So then you got a job at the Urban League. How long were you with the Urban League?
CD: About four years.
JD: And did you start&#8212;? Because the Urban League can be political at times. Did you start getting involved in any sort of&#8212;?
CD: I did. I actually ran for office. I ran for a school board position, or I tried to run for a school board position. Because I hadn&#8217;t qualified when everybody else qualified I had to collect signatures and unfortunately&#8212;. I collected them all but we didn&#8217;t get there&#8212;. We got to the town hall at like 5:01 and they would not accept them so I was not allowed to get on the ballot. But it was a very different&#8212;. My parents were Republicans and back then most of the parents that I grew up with were Republican, not Democrat, and most of them said they would never vote Democrat. Even though John Kennedy became the President in there somewhere they were diehard Republicans because they remembered Jim Crow America and what Bull Connor and all of those guys did back then. So when I ran, I ran as a Democrat and my parents, I think, felt some kind of way about that because they were Republicans, but the Democrat party back then wasn&#8217;t as liberal as it is now. It was more socially conscious but not necessarily liberal when it came to issues like the family and keeping hearth and home together.         But my job with the Urban League, after I did the education program I became the vice president of programs and pretty much became the grant writer for that particular Urban League, so a lot of the work that I did was for grants to like&#8212;. I remember before we had PCs one of the early machines that came out was the IBM DisplayWrite. It was a word processor and it was this huge machine but Xerox gave us&#8212;it was manufactured by Xerox&#8212;and they gave us tons of them and we actually trained people to become the word processors for these major companies in Stamford. So they were very successful programs.
JD: Was this in the late [19]70s?
CD: Mid to late.
JD: Okay.
CD: Mid to late. Then I left the Urban League and went&#8212;. Well after my education program I did a complete evaluation of the education program and one of the board members saw my evaluation and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread so she got me a position with a mayor in Bridgeport, Connecticut to help administer the old CETA funds, and I don&#8217;t remember what CETA stands for, C-E-T-A.
JD: It&#8217;s on the tip of my tongue, but I know what CETA funds are.
CD: Yeah. So there was a gentleman there who was my manager, my director, and he loved me, so when he left Bridgeport to go work for a mayor in New Haven he asked me to come with him, so I went with him to New Haven to administer their CETA program in New Haven and then I went back to the Urban League. That was until the mid &#8217;80s.
JD: This whole period there&#8217;s a lot going on. Did you have any reflections on the emerging feminism movement? Did you experience any sexual discrimination on the job, any forms of discrimination?
CD: I did not. I was fully aware of the feminism movement and actually remember the day that Roe v. Wade was passed, that the Supreme Court said that abortion was legal. My mother laughed and said, &#8220;There&#8217;s not a black woman in the world that would kill her baby like that after our experience with Jim Crow and slavery.&#8221; So she thought it was white women craziness and that&#8217;s how she treated it. I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve ever been discriminated against as a woman. If I was, it was all rolled into the race thing so I didn&#8217;t see the two as being separate. I have been discriminated against because of my race, but I wasn&#8217;t cognizant of the feminist part of it.
JD: I was going to ask you your reaction to Roe v. Wade. You said your mom&#8217;s reaction. Were you just listening to your mom or did you have one of your own that you can remember?
CD: I&#8217;m post-abortive so&#8212;. It wasn&#8217;t in the forefront of my brain. I&#8217;ve never been a feminist but when I was in my junior year, my junior/senior year of college, I actually had an abortion before Roe v. Wade was passed. New York was the first state that allowed abortions legally and I believe Alan Guttmacher was the doctor that did my abortion in New York. It was in 1972, the year before Roe was passed, and I found myself pregnant and I did not want the responsibility of a child. I never bought into the concept that it wasn&#8217;t a child. I was not one of those women that believed it was a blob of tissue or a product of conception or all that other stuff. I knew it was a child, and in a different interview just recently I had to look myself in the face and say how hardhearted I had been, because I also knew at the same time that had I gone to my mom and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m pregnant,&#8221; she would have taken the baby and sent me back to school to finish school. But I just did not want the responsibility and so I had an abortion. It was very traumatic. It was not the, you know, it&#8217;s no worse than getting your tooth pulled experience that many women want you to believe. In fact I fainted. After the abortion when I got up they gave me some orange juice and a cookie and said, &#8220;You can leave,&#8221; and I took one step and went out. I knew that I had done something horrific, but I had a Scarlet O&#8217;Hara attitude, I&#8217;ll think about it tomorrow, and so I kind of pushed it into the back of my mind. Then I went to law school and while I was in law school I got pregnant and I had a second abortion, and this time again I pushed it in the back of my mind. But the first several days after the second abortion I was absolutely traumatized because I heard the doctor counting my baby&#8217;s body parts, and that just sent me into a tailspin, but because I was in law school, again I didn&#8217;t want the responsibility. I wanted to be able to finish my degree, and think about that tomorrow.
JD: And in both cases&#8212;I don&#8217;t know if you want to tell me this or not&#8212;the potential father was in the picture, out of the picture?
CD: Oh, he was in the picture but I wasn&#8217;t going to tell him. I didn&#8217;t have to tell him, and that&#8217;s one of the terrible side effects of abortion, is that they vested the right in me, so I didn&#8217;t even have to discuss it with him at all. I found out I was pregnant, I made a decision and I took care of it, and neither of them ever knew because I never told them, because I didn&#8217;t have to.
JD: So then when did you begin to start changing your mind?
CD: After I became a Christian, a real Christian. I did grow up in a church, but I had never invited Jesus into my heart. I didn&#8217;t even know any such thing about that because in Faith Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church you weren&#8217;t joining Jesus you were joining a church, so when they would open the doors to the church and you went up to join you weren&#8217;t giving your affiliation to the God of the universe, you know? So I had a supernatural encounter with Jesus Christ. I used to drink alcohol and this particular night I was drunk. I was in law school, and I had drunk probably about a quart of scotch and I was real good and drunk. [Laughs] I was laying on the sofa in my sister&#8217;s basement and literally Jesus came into the basement and tapped me on the shoulder, and I rolled over and I looked. He was standing at the bottom of my sister&#8217;s stairs. I can see it just as clear today as I saw then. He was standing at the bottom of the stairs and he just looked so sad and he said, &#8220;Come follow me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Girl, you got the DTs,&#8221; [Laughs] and I rolled over, because I thought I was hallucinating from the alcohol, and literally he turned me back over, and I looked at him and he said, &#8220;Come follow me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; He told me what church to go to so that next morning I got up and I told my brother-in-law, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m supposed to go to church,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Well I&#8217;ll go with you because there&#8217;s this church that I want to go to,&#8221; so he drove by the church that I felt like the Lord had said go to and took me to this other church that had a female pastor, and that woman screamed. I can&#8217;t tell you to this day one word she said but all I know is I came out of there with the most horrific headache. Then I got home and I started drinking again and I said, &#8220;Well if that&#8217;s what you want me to become a part of I don&#8217;t want any parts of that,&#8221; and that was the first day that I got a migraine headache, right here in my temple. I was sitting there, drinking more scotch, and I said, &#8220;God, if you will remove this pain I will follow you the rest of my life,&#8221; and instantly the headache went away and I&#8217;ve been a born again Christian ever since.
After I gave my life to the Lord I did go to the little church that he told me to and the pastor there was really a Bible teacher and he began to teach me, and I had such a thirst and hunger to learn about Jesus. Somewhere in the midst of this one of my cousins who lived in Richmond, Virginia said you need to come see me. He was playing in a band, they were getting ready to sign a professional contract, and he said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t come see me now, when I get rich and famous don&#8217;t try to act like you know me.&#8221; [Laughs] So I said okay. So school was over and I went down to Virginia, I left my son&#8212;I do have two children&#8212;I left my son, he&#8217;s the oldest, with my sister in Connecticut and I went down for the weekend to hang out and party with Vincent. Well when I got there I felt like I had come home. I mean it really felt like this was where I was supposed to be.
So I went back home and thirty days later packed up hearth and home and moved to Richmond, Virginia, and when I got to Virginia I again went to a Baptist church but there was a woman that worked with me and she said, &#8220;Do you like to go to Bible studies?&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, well sure. I&#8217;ll go to the Bible study. So she said, &#8220;It&#8217;s called Noondays and instead of eating lunch we&#8217;ll go and do the Bible study and then we&#8217;ll come back to work.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, okay, so she took me to this church, Manna Christian Fellowship. It was on the corner of Broad and Belvedere in downtown Richmond, Virginia, and it used to be a car dealership that they had converted into a church. So I go in there and Wellington Boone was the pastor and oh, my father in heaven, he spoke with such fire. I felt like this was refreshing to my soul.         So that&#8217;s how I got introduced to the ministry that I&#8217;m a part of to this day, and it was through this Noonday program. At one of the Noondays&#8212;his name is Bishop Wellington Boone and Bishop Garland Hunt but back then it was Pastor Wellington Boone and Elder Garland Hunt&#8212;did a teaching on abortion and that was the very first time that I had to confront what I had done, and I got totally paralyzed in my guilt. I couldn&#8217;t even move, much less think about going back to work. I was just paralyzed in my guilt. Both men came and they prayed with me and they explained everything to me and told me that the Lord would forgive me if I repented and really got me so that I could go back to work, so they led me into a prayer of repentance. Then Bishop Boone said, &#8220;There is a book that I want you to read.&#8221; I said, okay. He said, &#8220;It&#8217;s by George Grant and it&#8217;s called Grand Illusions: The Legacy of Planned Parenthood.&#8221; I said, okay. So I went that day and bought the book. When I finished reading that book I was sitting in my living room, on the floor, and I was talking to God, and the scripture from Matthew that says Rachel would not be consoled, she was crying; she would not be consoled because her children were not, and I committed to God right then and there that I would be Rachel and I would cry for the babies and I would do everything that I could to help stop abortion in this country. So that was in 1987. I got saved in 1984 but this was in 1987. Not too long after that Pastor Boone formed an organization called Network of Politically Active Christian Women and I became very active in that organization, and George Allen was running for governor of Virginia.
JD: In 1988.
CD: In 1988, and I worked on his campaign. I went all around the state of Virginia and spoke on behalf of Gov. Allen, and Mike Farris was his running mate, and you didn&#8217;t see African American conservative women back then.
JD: And particularly because isn&#8217;t this the race against the first black governor of Virginia?
CD: Yeah.
JD: In the Democratic party. What was his name?
CD: Doug Wilder.
JD: Okay, there it is.
CD: Yeah, Doug Wilder. So we actually campaigned for him and he won, and that&#8217;s how I became politically active on this issue. I went around speaking about family, about abortion, about homosexuality, because back then they were trying to redefine the family in Virginia so that a man could be with a man and a woman with a woman, and God even had me speaking on that. So that&#8217;s how I became politically active.
JD: I wanted to go back and ask a few clarifying questions. Did you have your first son between the abortions?
CD: Yes, between the abortions. Then I had my daughter after the second abortion. By then I was absolutely committed. I was not going to commit anymore sins. I mean, I was sinning having sex outside of marriage but I wasn&#8217;t going to compound the sin by having anymore abortions so when I got pregnant with my daughter there was never a question that I would abort her. And I told the guy from day one, if I get pregnant don&#8217;t ask me to kill this baby because I&#8217;m not going to do it, and I stuck to my guns and I would not, even though he did ask me but I told him no. [Laughs]
JD: So the Network of Politically Active Christian Women, was it a biracial network or was it mostly&#8212;
CD: No.
JD: &#8212;made up of conservative&#8212;?
CD: It was African American conservative women. There were about twenty, thirty of us. We were called the &#8220;ladies in red&#8221; and we traveled the country. Actually we came here to Georgia and we had a chapter in Georgia, we had a chapter in North Carolina, we had a chapter in Florida. We were going state-to-state to organize black women to be a voice in the fight for life and family all around the country. But then we all kind of went different ways because some of the people moved to North Carolina to plant a church under Bishop Boone in North Carolina, some of us came here to Georgia, others stayed in Virginia, so we kind of spread out so the Network of Politically Active Christian Women went dormant for a couple of years. But that organization, under Bishop Boone, has been reactivated. We dropped the &#8220;women&#8221; and now it&#8217;s the Network of Politically Active Christians and it&#8217;s both African American, Caucasian, and whosoever will.
JD: Okay. So can you tell me a little bit more about Bishop Boone, because he seems to be really important to you in your life? What kind of personality does he have?
CD: Oh my gosh. He is a nationally known speaker. Do you remember Promise Keepers, when they were very active? He was one of the major African American speakers for Promise Keepers. He&#8217;s been on CBN and TBN and everybody else&#8217;s N.The foundation of our ministry is consecration, holiness, righteousness. It&#8217;s Jesus Christ first. We are indeed ambassadors for Christ, we are indeed members of the body of Christ, and he promotes Jesus first, which is kind of unusual today in African American circles. You hear the prosperity gospel and all of these other factions; well he&#8217;s never deviated at all from teaching and preaching Jesus, holiness, righteousness and consecration. He actually does a teaching called &#8220;worm training.&#8221; In Psalm 22 Jesus said, &#8220;I am no man; I am a worm,&#8221; and he has this teaching, what happens if you step on a snake? A snake is going to bite you. But what happens if you step on a worm? You&#8217;re going to crush it and the blood will flow, and that&#8217;s what Jesus expects from us is to allow people to walk on us as a bridge to get them to the Lord. So you shouldn&#8217;t strike back like a snake. Somebody step on your toe, you just forgive them. If you do something that you know you shouldn&#8217;t have done, be quick to repent, and so forth, so on.
JD: I want to ask you a little bit more. Faith is very important. In what ways before 1984 when you found Jesus, how were you lost?
CD: Oh, I was very lost. I was a crazy woman. When I was a little girl growing up in the projects my mom used to say girls don&#8217;t fight, and I would come home every day beat up from school because the kids knew I wasn&#8217;t going to fight back because I was going to obey my mom. I&#8217;d come home with my hair pulled out or a bloody nose or my dress torn or something, and so one day she&#8217;d finally had enough and she said, &#8220;Okay, fine, you can fight back,&#8221; and from that day forward I had a fight every single day, into middle school. But by middle school I had a little bit of a reputation so only the really stupid people messed with me, but if I thought you wanted to fight me I would hit you first. I wasn&#8217;t going to give you the chance to sneak up on me and hit me, because you knew as a street fighter that the person that threw the first blow was typically the person that was going to win, because they would hit you hard enough to be able to throw a second blow.         So that was how I grew up, I grew up as a fighter, and even though I was educated, even though I graduated magna cum laude, I was not afraid to fight you and I would fight men, I would fight women, I didn&#8217;t care. Even though I was a professional woman, I mean come on, I was the vice president of programs for the Urban League, but in black culture people knew you don&#8217;t mess with her because she will hurt you because she&#8217;s crazy, and that&#8217;s how I lived my life. I was crazy. I was streetwise. I drank alcohol, did a little coke on the side occasionally, but I was a fighter and that&#8217;s how I lived my life until I got saved. Then once I got saved I&#8217;m still a fighter, I just don&#8217;t hit you. [Laughs] I mean physically hit you. I might hit you in the spirit but I&#8217;m not going to physically slap you or whatever. Then I became even more intelligent because I understood then that the spirit of God lives in me, and so I don&#8217;t need to fight with my fists. I can fight through prayer, I can fight through going before the throne rather than physically jumping on you, or I can do some things to fight you without ever touching you. So I truly became a born-again Christian, truly. I am a living, breathing example of what it means to be born again.        JD: So you&#8212;I&#8217;m also trying to figure, when you came down to Richmond you said you had a job. When you left Connecticut did you leave the Urban League and then what was your&#8212;?        CD: I left the Urban League because they laid me off. This was a part of my journey, I think, with the Lord, looking back on it. At the time I was madder than spit because I was the grant writer. How are you going to lay off the person&#8212;?        JD: And you got a law degree, it sounds like, or you went to law school.        CD: I went to law school. Okay, so this is what happened. They laid me off, I got evicted from my apartment, and I went to live in my sister&#8217;s basement in Milford, Connecticut. It was during the time that I was in my sister&#8217;s basement that the University of Bridgeport had introduced a new law program. They started the program in January and what they had you do was to complete the first year of study in six months from January to June with no break and then they put you on track with the regular semester kind of thing, so I entered that program. So I would go to school during the day and I would come home and read the nine hundred pages that they had assigned and then I&#8217;d drink and go to sleep, and then I&#8217;d get up the next day and do the same thing. All of my classes were in the evening so I had most of the day to recover from [Laughs] my drinking bouts, and I was going to school and drinking, drinking and going to school.         But my last year of university I got a job with an organization called Neighborhood Reinvestment and they would go and work with homeowners, city officials, and banks to give low-interest or no-interest loans to revitalize your neighborhood. It was a great job. So I did that for about a year and then school ended, but I didn&#8217;t physically get my degree in my hand because I owed [tuition] for the last semester of school and they would not release the degree and I never made enough money to keep hearth and home together with my son and then still pay that last semester, so I never physically got my degree in my hand.        JD: But you got all the education.        CD: I got all the education, I completed all the coursework.         JD: So then when you came down to Richmond what did you then do? So Richmond became  the place for you to go after all of that.        CD: Well that was the amazing thing. I just moved to Richmond, I lived with a cousin&#8212;I lived with a wife of a cousin, [Laughs] because they had gotten divorced by the time I went down there, but Shirley is just like a sister anyway. But she let me live with her and I slept on her sofa in her living room until I was able to find an apartment, and I was getting a little bit of unemployment because of the Neighborhood Reinvestment job and then I started applying for jobs with the state of Virginia, which was unheard of for someone to move into Virginia and get a state job. According to the Virginians those were all reserved for them and it took you years and years and years to get one. Well I moved down to Richmond on August the 6th and I started working for the state of Virginia in December, and everybody just thought that that was a miracle because you just did not move into Richmond and get a job that easily and I did. But I worked for the state of Virginia as a personnel specialist, doing human resources with the department of education, and then I got a promotion and went to the department of mental health, mental retardation, and substance abuse services and did their HR. I was the EEO manager and I handled all of their EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] complaints in addition to doing generalist stuff, but primarily they had an average caseload of thirty-six active EEOC cases a month, and I managed to get it down to less than ten a month. So that was my claim to fame, working for the state of Virginia.        JD: So you had the Noonday and then you had this breakthrough when they gave the first lecture on abortion. What did they tell you about abortion? Do you remember that particular moment?        CD: I absolutely remember it. In the Old Testament there is scripture that talks about sacrificing your seed to Molech, and Molech was this big iron kind of idol, and I forget which one of the &#8220;ites&#8221; worshiped him but one of those &#8220;ites,&#8221; the Moabites or the Hittites or somebody, and what they would do was to heat&#8212;. It was like a big oven that looked like a thing, like an animal-man thing, and it would hold its arms out straight in front of it and its stomach was like an oven. They would put the coal and wood&#8212;not coal, but wood and stuff&#8212;and they would heat it up, heat it up, heat it up, and then they would literally take their children and lay their children in the arms of Molech and their children would literally burn to death because it was so hot. They used that scripture and analogized abortion to sacrificing your seed to Molech, and they talked about the most common method of abortion back then was the saline-solution abortion which literally burned the baby to death, and they were saying there was no difference, and even if you didn&#8217;t have the saline solution abortion but you allowed your child to be ripped into pieces coming out of your womb, then you were the modern day version of that idol and you&#8217;re placing your child in the idol&#8217;s arms to be burned alive. The modern day version of that was the saline-solution abortion or the suction curettage. I will never forget that as long as I live.         JD: So you said you&#8217;re post-abortive. How did the healing process then begin, because it sounds like the healing process didn&#8217;t really start for you until they sat down with you after that?        CD: It was through prayer. I&#8217;m not one that&#8212;. I don&#8217;t take a long time to do anything. [Laughs] It&#8217;s just not my nature. So when they prayed with me for forgiveness, I was instantly healed. I didn&#8217;t go through a period of grief or mourning or some of the other testimonies that you get from other women. I was instantly healed. Once I got it into my frontal lobe that Jesus Christ of Nazareth forgave me for that god-awful thing that I had done to my children then I immediately became an activist because I was healed, and that was no longer something that could pull me away or get me to think that in some way I was unforgiven. It was instantaneous once I understood and once they prayed me through it, and they took the time to walk me through it in prayer that very afternoon.         JD: And then you read Grand Illusions. What was your response after you read Grand Illusions?        CD: I was angry. I was angry first at myself for having bought into the notion that we could take the life of our child but I was angry as I had ever been at Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger and wanted to do something. It spurred me on to want to do something. So I began to pray, &#8220;Lord, what can I do? I&#8217;m only one person but if you tell me to do something I will do it. What do you want me to do?&#8221; It was just a few weeks later or maybe a couple of months later that Bishop Boone started talking about&#8212;. Actually it was more like months later, but he started talking about the Network of Politically Active Christian Women, and that was my answer. I also immediately volunteered with Virginia Right to Life.         JD: Okay.        CD: And Beth York was the executive director back then and she was happy to have me come and be a part of&#8212;.        JD: What were some of the things you did with Virginia Right to Life? Did you do education presentations? What were things that you did?        CD: I went and spoke before legislators, community groups, anywhere that they needed a black voice I would go. For example there was an event&#8212;. I&#8217;m trying to remember exactly what the event was. I just remember this very, very, very angry woman who stood in my face, toe to toe, screaming at me that a woman had a right to choose, and I remember me telling her, dear, you&#8217;re wrong, and you&#8217;re not going to move me off of my position by screaming in my face, [Laughs] but you&#8217;re wrong. But I can&#8217;t remember what the event was; I just remember her anger, and she was post-abortive, and that&#8217;s one of the symptoms of a post-abortive woman. We can be very angry, especially if someone is saying that we did something wrong. But I would go to speaking events, primarily. I was one of their chief spokespersons so wherever they needed me to go they would call me up and say can you come to such and such and I&#8217;d be like, yeah, I can come, and I would go speak.         JD: Did you have any feelings&#8212;? I mean you mentioned earlier that when they needed a black voice you were willing to talk. Did you have any feelings about the need of a black voice, or how did that work?        CD: Oh, absolutely, because one of the things that I read in Grand Illusions was about Margaret Sanger&#8217;s &#8220;Negro project&#8221; and how she had the nerve to pay black ministers to promote her birth control, population control agenda from the pulpit, and I&#8217;m like, something&#8217;s wrong with this picture. So from the very beginning I was like well God, if she could be an advocate and a voice for the devil I can be an advocate and voice for you. Black women need to understand that this is a continuation of Jim Crow, this is a continuation of slavery, and they&#8217;ve just disguised it very well in the women&#8217;s rights movement. They went to the two groups in this country that were most starved for rights, African Americans and women, because back in the day women were civilly dead. You couldn&#8217;t own property, you couldn&#8217;t vote, you couldn&#8217;t do anything without the blessing of your husband or your dad or your brother or some male figure had to be in your life in order to give you civil rights so women were civilly dead. Then you had black women who were civilly dead twice because now you&#8217;re black and you&#8217;re a woman, so black women had no rights. So here&#8217;s Margaret Sanger who comes to you and says, &#8221;Whoo, whoo, whoo; I&#8217;m going to give you some rights that you can control your own body,&#8221; all the time understanding that she had a eugenics agenda that she was promoting to control the black birth rate. When I read that letter, and I actually sent to Smith College to get a copy of the letter that she wrote to Dr. C. J. Gamble where she said the minister is the one to straighten it out if it ever occurred to any of our more rebellious members that she wanted to exterminate us. The blood was boiling then. It was like, yeah, okay; I can do something. I can use my voice and I can be an instrument in this fight.         JD: So did you feel empowered for your activism as a black woman?        CD: Oh absolutely, absolutely, and it was interesting because a black conservative, at that time, was such an anomaly that white people loved to ask me to come speak [Laughs] so I had a great time going around and spreading the word on life, on education, on the family. I mean I spoke on a number of different issues depending on what venue I had been asked to speak in.        JD: Did you have any awkward moments, misunderstandings, with majority white audiences? I mean it&#8217;s so strange&#8212;.        CD: All the time.        JD: Can you give me some examples of that?        CD: White people are afraid of black people, I don&#8217;t know another way to say it, and I have a very strong personality and I know that I have a strong personality. I have cried over my personality and said, &#8220;God, change me,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Stop asking me that. I made you this way to do this work.&#8221; But there would be disagreements and conflict all the time because I speak authoritatively. I&#8217;m not trying to speak that way, [Laughs] it&#8217;s just the way I talk. I don&#8217;t know any more than anybody else. I mean I try to learn stuff but I am not a know-it-all and I&#8217;ve been accused of thinking that I&#8217;m a know-it-all and all of this kind of stuff and it really is because I have such a strong personality. So I&#8217;ve had to learn to modulate my tones, to be very careful in what I am saying and how I&#8217;m saying it, to think carefully before I speak, because I&#8217;m not trying to intimidate so much as I am trying to communicate information and wanting people to hear what I&#8217;m saying.         So going around and speaking to white audiences, I mean I&#8217;ve had people say well why do you just care about the black babies, why won&#8217;t you care about the white babies, and things like that, where they would come at me: &#8220;You&#8217;re talking about your people; well what about the rest of the people?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, what are you talking about? It&#8217;s that kind of give and take. Or I&#8217;ve had occasions to interact with white men where they felt intimidated by something that I was saying or something that I did and they would attempt to back me into a corner to get me to do what they wanted me to do as opposed to what I was saying or what I was doing, and I&#8217;m not going to do that.         JD: Do you think that they thought that you represented a challenge to their own authority?        CD: Yes, every time, every single time.        JD: Did you have any interactions like that with white women in conservative circles?        CD: Not so much the women because they wouldn&#8217;t confront me; with the white feminists, the rapidly feminist pro-abortion person, yes, but some of the white pro-life people, no. Females wouldn&#8217;t confront me but the men would.         JD: Why do you think that is?        CD: Probably because they were afraid of me, and they didn&#8217;t know what I would say. Fear will make you do crazy things, you know.        JD: Did you develop any good friendships within the movement?        CD: Oh, I have tons of them.         JD: Are the friendships different with black conservatives than they are with white conservatives&#8212;        CD: Yes.        JD: &#8212;in terms of understanding? How so?        CD: In all honesty whites don&#8217;t understand black culture, and they filter information through the lenses of their life experiences, which are vastly different than life experiences in the black culture. So you will find that black people can adapt more readily and easily in a white environment than white people can in a black environment, and there&#8217;s a fear factor there because the culture has billed African Americans as being these violent people who are just one word short of just jumping on you and bringing chaos and murdering everybody in their sleep. That has always been the picture that has been painted of the black community going all the way back to slavery. If you&#8217;ll remember in the history books when John Brown&#8212;was it John Brown? Was that his name?&#8212;was going around and he killed some white people, oh, my God, the white people were like, &#8220;Oh, my God, we got to lock up all the black people because they&#8217;re going to come and kill us in our sleep.&#8221; That imagery has followed the black community even unto this day, so much so that some black people are even afraid of black people, especially black men walking down the street. We&#8217;ll tend to clutch our purses a little bit tighter or cross to the other side because of this imagery that black people are violent, whether it&#8217;s a man or a woman, and that&#8217;s still true today. So when you have people filtering through those kinds of lenses it becomes a challenge that you have to first fight through the racial stuff and then you can perhaps get your message across, so most white [sic] people have learned how to adapt and when they&#8217;re in white environments they speak white and then when they go home they relax and can be themselves.         JD: Okay. So then what are the friendships like then with white women, if you&#8217;ve developed those?        CD: Well I&#8217;m not a good one to measure it by because I confront stuff like that. I mean if we&#8217;re going to be friends I have to be free to be myself if I&#8217;m going to be with you, and I don&#8217;t want to have to always couch my words for fear that you&#8217;re going to cower in the corner and say, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re being mean.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying?        JD: You&#8217;ve got to be able to call them out.        CD: Yeah, and one of the things a dear friend of mine, Bishop Boone&#8217;s daughter, she always says, rule number one is know your people, so you take the time to get to know the people in your environment and you adjust accordingly. Like if you are not a multi-tasker I&#8217;d be dumber than the doorpost to try to get you to multi-task. Why are we going to go through that when you&#8217;re going to fail, you&#8217;re going to hate me because I&#8217;m making you do something that you really can&#8217;t do, and we&#8217;re just going to go at each other and we&#8217;re not going to be productive in whatever the thing is we&#8217;re working on. So over the years I have learned to identify the strengths and the weaknesses of the people that I associate with and so I just ask them to do what they can, and that resolves the conflict [Laughs] in most cases and I&#8217;m not taking them out of their comfort zone and they&#8217;re not putting me in a box somewhere. So we are able to connect and do things, and it doesn&#8217;t mean that we won&#8217;t fight occasionally because we all have our opinions, especially in the pro-life movement. We can be very opinionated and we think our way is the right way and if you&#8217;re not going to do it my way then you shouldn&#8217;t do it at all.         JD: Especially at the national level. There&#8217;s some strong leadership [Laughs] and strong personalities.        CD: There&#8217;s some strong personalities. I wouldn&#8217;t call it leadership because we&#8217;ve had abortion for thirty-nine years and we haven&#8217;t made an impact, and people get angry with me when I say that but abortion has been 1.2million abortions for the last, I can&#8217;t tell you how many years. Georgia has every piece of incremental legislation, almost, that they were recommending and yet the numbers haven&#8217;t diminished, so I don&#8217;t know that we&#8217;ve had leadership so much as strong personalities speaking out.         JD: I was going to ask you, when you first got involved, how&#8212;? Oh, what&#8217;s the question? Sorry. This is an interview. Usually I have the questions right on the tips and I write them down. So you started becoming involved in 1988. What was it like to be involved in Republican circles at that point in time?         CD: In Virginia it was great. In Georgia it was horrible, but Virginia was more open back then. They were more willing to allow blacks into the circle of leadership, to allow blacks to lead. In Georgia, when I moved here, it was like beating my head against a stone wall. I ran for office here for the state house. I had an incident. Not too long after we first moved here my daughter was at the bus stop and a boy&#8212;. She had on a thick coat but he was shooting at her and the other kids with a BB gun, and so the police came and we filed a police report and when I went to get a copy of the report they blacked his name and address out on the report but he had all of my information. The laws protected him but they didn&#8217;t protect me and my daughter, and so when I realized that I said, okay, we got to move, so I immediately started looking for a new apartment. Then I went to my state representatives to say, &#8220;Y&#8217;all need to do something about this law because he could come and do some harm to me and my daughter. I have no idea where he lives or what his name is or anything else.&#8221; The legislator whose district I was in came alongside me and said, &#8220;If I can help you in any way I will.&#8221; The legislator whose district I was moving into blew me off. So when he blew me off I decided you shouldn&#8217;t be the representative because you don&#8217;t care about your constituents and I&#8217;m going to run against you, so I did. Well, one of my white Republican women&#8217;s groups, one of the members called me up and said, &#8220;Are you a closet Democrat and you know that you can&#8217;t win in this district because you&#8217;re black and this is a Republican district?&#8221; She confronted me. So I answered her questions as best I could, and I&#8217;ve been a member of the group for the last fifteen, sixteen years.         But being a Republican in this area has been hard. Now, when I ran for Congress, which I did run against Cynthia McKinney, back then when I first ran black Republicans were literally spat on by black Democrats. And Sunny Warren, who ran in this district before me, literally had voters take her information and crumble it up right in front of her and throw it in the trash. But it&#8217;s not like that now. I think I could run now and win even though I&#8217;m in a majority black, majority Democrat district.         JD: What is your response to people who kind of call you, I mean it&#8217;s not quite accurate, but the Uncle Tom stereotype?        CD: You know, I&#8217;ve never had one call me one to my face.        JD: Okay.        CD: I&#8217;ve been waiting though. I&#8217;ve been wanting them to, but I&#8217;ve never had one brave enough to come to my face, and I think it&#8217;s because I am not what they would consider your typical Uncle Tom-ish type, like a Clarence Thomas or a Michael Steele type. All of my street fighting is still here. My street sense is like the Spidey sense, it&#8217;s still here, and they can see it and they can feel it. They&#8217;d have a hard time calling me a Tom. Now they may disagree with my politics but I don&#8217;t think they feel&#8212;. Well, she didn&#8217;t call me an Uncle Tom. She did say that white people were pulling my strings, and that was&#8212;        JD: That was&#8212;?        CD: &#8212;Heidi Williamson from an organization called SisterSong, which is here in Atlanta. They are some of the chief spokespersons for the abortion industry. As a matter of fact, a year ago here in Georgia we put up a billboard that said black children are an endangered species&#8212;        JD: I&#8217;m going to get to these questions.        CD: &#8212;and Loretta Ross and Heidi were the group that they pulled out to speak against me and against the billboards, and Heidi was the one that said that white people were pulling my strings.         JD: How did that make you feel?        CD: I laughed at her. I told her the only man pulling my strings is Jesus Christ of Nazareth [Laughs] so she didn&#8217;t ever go there. She never went there again with me. But I do know friends of mine that have been called Toms that are considered out of the mainstream.        JD: I had a question for you, when you first joined the Christian&#8212;sorry.        CD: Network of Politically Active&#8212;.        JD: Activists.        CD: Mm hmm.        JD: Did you have mentors or were there mentors for conservative black women?        CD: No&#8212;.        JD: In other words, did you kind of know what you should be?        CD: No, no. We were it. But Bishop Boone and Bishop Hunt and all of the other leaders were teaching from a biblical worldview and when you understand the mandate to you as a Christian from a biblical worldview you can&#8217;t be anything else except a conservative. So I wouldn&#8217;t have necessarily characterized myself as a conservative but the language that I speak on the issues makes me that. But I&#8217;m a Bible-based, biblical worldview saint, ambassador of Christ.        JD: So then you became pretty involved in Republican politics if you were running for the campaigns.        CD: Oh yes, yes, because I could not run as a Democrat. That would be hypocritical, because I don&#8217;t support anything they say that they believe in, but in the Republican platform there are biblically based principles that the Republicans say they believe, and in Georgia we are a two-party state. You either are Republican or you&#8217;re Democrat. There are people who characterize themselves as independents but there is no registration as an independent, so they measure what your political affiliation is by what ballot you ask for during the primary process, and for a black person to ask for a Republican ballot was pretty remarkable. But I couldn&#8217;t be a Democrat because I don&#8217;t believe in same-sex marriage, I don&#8217;t believe in abortion on demand, I don&#8217;t believe in big government, I don&#8217;t believe the government should be taking care of us. I believe that there are some responsibilities that the church has and that the church has abdicated in favor of the government and I advocate for the church to step into its role according to what the Bible says, so because of that, that puts me in this other category.        JD: How did you navigate, or how do you navigate, because there might be some people who&#8217;ll ask you specific questions such as how does the Republican party better serve the black community over the Democratic party, or are you expected to make arguments as such as a black woman?        CD: Yes, and the answers that I give&#8212;.We can never have political power in this country as long as we are voting one party. We have to begin to vote both parties or join the Tea Party or something, but if we truly want to have political power, if we truly want a political voice, we have to start doing something differently. As I said at the beginning, my parents were Republicans so I grew up with Republican politics as my politics, not Democrat. My parents talked about the party of Lincoln, you know, it was Lincoln that freed the slaves, and so forth, so on, so it was not hard for me to continue in the legacy that my parents left me, which was that of a conservative Republican. So when I talk about it I talk about it in terms of our clout. I talk about it in terms of do we truly have a voice, and we don&#8217;t, because so many of us vote one party. When you strip away all of the fluff and all of the dogma it&#8217;s all about who can you get to vote for you. [Laughs] That&#8217;s what it boils down to. So when we elect a black Republican from a district like what I&#8217;m sitting in right now, it&#8217;s going to flip politics in America on its ear and then the black community will see true political power in action.        JD: When did you get to meet Alveda King? Do you remember your first meeting with her and your response or reaction?        CD: You know I don&#8217;t remember my first meeting; I kind of feel like I&#8217;ve always known her. I know that it was through Georgia Right to Life but I honestly do not recall when I first met her.        JD: When did you move to Atlanta, or Georgia?        CD: Sixteen years ago, [19]94.         JD: A lot was happening in Georgia Right to Life&#8212;.        CD: &#8217;95.        JD: Okay.        CD: August the 6th of &#8217;95, exactly ten years after I moved to Virginia.        JD: Do you want to talk a little bit more about the&#8212;? When did Georgia Right to Life hire you on as the outreach? It was after your congressional race.        CD: 2009.        JD: Were you really excited about that?        CD: Not in the traditional sense. I am a seasoned human-resources professional and I&#8217;ve worked for&#8212;.        JD: So you continued to be a human-resources person when you moved to Georgia?        CD: Yes, and I actually started working for Sprint. I worked for Sprint for ten years and I managed the southeast region, so to go from a Fortune 40 environment into a nonprofit environment, making one-third of the money that I used to make, was not a pleasant experience for me. [Laughs]        JD: [Laughs]        CD: It actually set me back financially pretty significantly, but from a doing-what-God-has-called-me-to-do perspective it was probably one of the most awesome experiences I&#8217;ve had in my life. So I was a little bit schizophrenic while working for Georgia Right to Life because I was not making enough money to keep hearth and home together but I was absolutely knocking the ball out of the park with regard to changing the conversation regarding life in the black community. [Break in recording]        JD: And we&#8217;re back again.         CD: Okay, so from a spiritual perspective it was great and from a financial and natural perspective it was not so great.        JD: So you started work in 2009. So I&#8217;m trying to figure out&#8212;. Daniel Becker at that point had made some pretty significant changes at Georgia Right to Life. Do you remember what those were? Were you aware of those when you were hired on, sort of Daniel Becker&#8217;s vision as president?        CD: No.        JD: Okay. Did you know Dan Becker very well?        CD: Yes. I knew Dan because Bishop Boone was one of their speakers and I would go to the Walk for Life that they had every year, but usually I was there as one of the leaders of the Father&#8217;s House, which is Bishop Boone&#8217;s church here in Georgia. But before I went to work for Georgia Right to Life I got a call from Dean Nelson. Dean at that time was the executive director of the Network of Politically Active Christians that had been reorganized, and Georgia Right to Life was introducing a personhood amendment that defined the baby as a person from conception to death, and Dean called me and asked me would I lobby the black caucus here in Georgia on behalf of personhood and I was more than happy to do it. At that point I had been laid off from Sprint, I had a year&#8217;s severance package so I could pretty much do what I wanted to do, and I was happy to go down to the capitol and lobby the General Assembly but what I found myself ending up doing was lobbying Republicans more than I was black Democrats because there were so many obstacles being thrown up by these Republicans. Even though they had run and proclaimed themselves to be pro-life they weren&#8217;t in reality, so when it came to backing this bill they weren&#8217;t seeing it.         So what ended up happening&#8212;[Laughs] it was really funny&#8212;their lobbyist&#8217;s name is Mike Griffin and Mike&#8212;we called ourselves Ebony and Ivory. We would go and we would shanghai these Republicans in their offices and we&#8217;d tell them, &#8220;What&#8217;s up with you? I thought you were a Republican,&#8221; or whatever. Somewhere in the process we began to hear these rumblings about then Speaker of the House Glenn Richardson, and we were being told that Glenn Richardson was a eugenicist, that he filtered any legislative request through the eyes of, who&#8217;s going to take care of all these little black babies? So when I heard that I said to Alveda, we need to go talk to Glenn. Well at the same time that I was saying to her we need to go talk to Glenn, Glenn&#8217;s chief of staff heard that we knew what he had said, and I actually had a black lobbyist come to me on behalf of Glenn Richardson and basically ask me did I know that I was putting my neck in a noose by actively speaking out against what I was hearing Glenn had said. I told him, I said, &#8220;Sweetie, there&#8217;s some things you die for, and I don&#8217;t understand why you&#8217;re not over here dying with me.&#8221; For the Speaker of the House to say that he doesn&#8217;t want to pass pro-life legislation because it would mean that more black babies would be on the dole, that doesn&#8217;t offend you? What in the world? That this man is saying he&#8217;d rather have black babies get killed in an abortuary than be born&#8212;why aren&#8217;t you over here with me, getting your neck in the noose?         So anyway, the chief of staff called me and asked would Alveda and I come to meet with them and I said sure. So Alveda and I go into this meeting and we said, &#8220;Glenn, did you say this?&#8221; [He said,] &#8220;Well, I might have said something like that but I didn&#8217;t say that.&#8221; [We said,] &#8220;Okay, well what did you say?&#8221; [He said,] &#8220;Well it wasn&#8217;t that. I paid for a bus to go around Georgia and try to&#8212;,&#8221; do something. I can&#8217;t remember what he said the bus was for, sickle cell anemia bus, and [he said] his sister adopted a little black baby into the family and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, and I&#8217;m like, Glenn, all of that&#8217;s wonderful, but did you say this and are you measuring legislative initiatives through those eyes, and he would never come out and say directly, &#8220;Yes, I said it, or I&#8217;m sorry, or even I&#8217;m sorry that you have the perception that I said it.&#8221; He just tried to offer us things to make it go away. So we left that meeting terribly, terribly disappointed, and it was after that that Georgia Right to Life asked me would you come on board and head up the outreach to the black community.         JD: So then how did that make you feel? Did SisterSong get a hold of the story? What was the response?        CD: Oh, they didn&#8217;t care. Well I don&#8217;t know that they knew it because no media would publish the story. We tried to go to the media&#8212;.        JD: Because it was hearsay or they couldn&#8217;t get anyone on record.        CD: They couldn&#8217;t get two people to corroborate it and the legislators that told us very clearly that he had said it, only one of them would go public. Only one of them was courageous enough to stand up and say, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly what he said.&#8221; So not too long after that I started working for Georgia Right to Life and did the outreach, and it was interesting. It was very hard the first year because getting into black churches is not easy. You can&#8217;t just call up and ask for an appointment with the pastor and get into see him. You have to know somebody that knows somebody. So initially&#8212;.        JD: So they had high expectations of you, or you feel like they had high expectations?        CD: No, I just don&#8217;t think that they understood going in what it was going to take. I think they thought things would happen more quickly than what they happened and so they may have been disappointed that we weren&#8217;t knocking the ball out of the park from day one, and I kept trying to get them to understand that you can&#8217;t cold-call a black pastor. You got to know somebody. Eventually we got there. I started doing breakfasts and lunches and I got some of the Congressmen to host the event for me, so when you get a letter from a Congressman as a pastor you&#8217;re typically going to say yes. Then I started praying and asking God, &#8220;Okay, how am I supposed to do this?&#8221; And eventually I started going to the pastors&#8217; wives and getting them engaged, and we had great success. Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t penetrate Atlanta, but all around, Athens, Gainesville, Savannah, Douglasville, you name it. I was going to all these outlying parts of Georgia and having great success. So it was a question of timing.         At the end of the first year Dan began to talk about wanting to offer a piece of legislation for the 2010 cycle and I started talking about, which I had been talking about the entire time, black children are an endangered species. If we don&#8217;t do something we are going to end up not here, we&#8217;re going to be extinct, so can we write a piece of legislation that&#8217;s like the Endangered Species Act, because that&#8217;s really what&#8217;s happening to our babies. At the same time that I began saying that in the spring of 2009 a videographer by the name of Chad Bonham had asked me would I be a part of this video that he was doing, and I&#8217;m like, sure. So I invited him here and he came and we did a video and while he was here he said, &#8220;Do you know Ryan Bomberger?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, never heard of him. Who&#8217;s Ryan Bomberger?&#8221; So he told me a little bit of Ryan&#8217;s story, that Ryan&#8217;s mother had been raped and she chose adoption rather than abortion, even though abortion was legal at the time she had been raped. So Chad kept urging me, call Ryan, call Ryan, call Ryan, and so he bugged me so much I said, &#8220;Okay, Lord, you must be telling me to call Ryan.&#8221; So I did and he and I had a lunch. That was in like April, May of 2009. In October of 2009 I had said to Ryan, &#8220;If our children were animals they&#8217;d be on the endangered species list,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;I say that all the time,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, yeah, because it&#8217;s true.         Well we had a regional meeting of Georgia Right to Life in Macon, Georgia. Ryan lives in Alpharetta. The offices of Georgia Right to Life at the time were in Lawrenceville, but he drove to Macon and he brought his computer and he did this thing on the computer and then he turned the screen around and said, &#8220;Look,&#8221; and on it was the billboard, &#8220;Black children are an endangered species. Toomanyaborted.com,&#8221; and when I saw that I was like, wow. That is what I&#8217;m talking about. So I said let&#8217;s show it to Dan, so we called Dan over and Dan came over and I said, &#8220;Dan, look,&#8221; and he looked at it and he said, &#8220;Ooh, that&#8217;s a billboard.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yeah, it is.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Praise God.&#8221; So that&#8217;s how we came up with the &#8220;black children are an endangered species&#8221; campaign. But at the same time I wanted a companion piece of legislation that will call attention to the discriminatory impact that abortion was having, so I kept talking about look at the Endangered Species Act, or Civil Rights Act, or something, and I even called Alveda and said, &#8220;How did your dad and your uncle come up with the Civil Rights Act? Did they get a lawyer to write it, did they sit in a room and they all talked about it, how did it happen,&#8221; because I felt like there could be a piece of legislation that would have the same impact for babies as the Civil Rights Act had to end Jim Crow in America. We went around and around and around, and Georgia Right to Life hired this former legislator to write a piece of legislation that turned out to be junk.        JD: Was this Senate Bill 529?        CD: Senate Bill 529, but there was one legislator, Ed Setzler, who took it on to write that bill, and that piece of legislation was the best piece of civil rights legislation I&#8217;ve ever seen. It said that if the abortionist knew that the motive for the abortion was race or gender it was a felony if he did it. It gave the woman a private right of action. So Georgia has several pieces of incremental legislation: A woman&#8217;s right to know, twenty-four hour waiting period, parental notification, ultrasound bill, we have all of that. If the abortionist violated any one of those pieces of legislation and did the abortion, she had a right to sue for the life of the baby, which is like six, ten million a pop. Then the third thing that it did was pull in the RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] statute so that we could begin to examine and hold hearings on the locations of the abortion clinics in Georgia. Were they conspiring to control the black birthrate?  It was a great piece of legislation.  So Ed wrote this legislation in like a twenty-four hour period of time. And, oh, my God, I was so excited. So now we have a majority Republican senate, we have a majority Republican house, we have a Republican governor.        JD: This is after the 2010 elections, or in the midst of the 2010. Is that right?        CD: It was 2010 but we had a Republican senate and house and all of that before.        JD: Okay.        CD: So surely this piece of legislation was going to pass and it was going to change the political landscape of abortion in America. It went through every committee that it was supposed to go through. We followed the integrity of the legislative process in Georgia. They pulled the bill&#8212;. It passed the first committee and they pulled it and sent it back saying that &#8220;coercion&#8221; wasn&#8217;t clear enough.        JD: The legal term.        CD: Yes. So we had the lawyers work on it and they rewrote the definition of coercion. We had a young woman who came to testify. She was a young white woman that had had sex with a black man. She got pregnant. Her parents told her you&#8217;re not going to bring that little black so-and-so into our home&#8212;.        JD: Was she underage?        CD: When she got pregnant she was. You&#8217;re not going to bring that little black so-and-so into our home, and so when she got to the abortion clinic she told them, I do not want an abortion, the only reason why they&#8217;re making me have an abortion is because my boyfriend is black, and they took the life of her baby. So that was the example of race. Then that same month that we introduced the legislation, the Economist magazine came out with the article, &#8220;A Hundred Million Missing Girls,&#8221; talking about gender-selection abortion, so we had all of the documentation. At the same time Mark Crutcher had released Maafa 21, which clearly documented the eugenics history of abortion in America. So we had all our ducks in a row and the Speaker of the House, whose name is David Ralston, then pulled the bill again and reassigned it to the committee that had dubbed itself the &#8220;committee from hell,&#8221; meaning they never passed anything. It even made it through the committee from hell, got to the rules committee, and it should have gone to the floor of the House where everybody acknowledged that if that bill got to the floor of the house it was going to pass. The Speaker of the House general counsel was seen rewriting SB 529 with the abortion lobbyists, and when they couldn&#8217;t get us to agree to their gutted bill they would not let it get out of the rules committee to the floor of the House. It was blocked by the Speaker of the House, David Ralston. He said I&#8217;m not letting it out. Now Glenn Richardson was the eugenicist but he never violated the integrity of the legislative process. He told us up front, your personhood bill is not going to make it out of the gate. I don&#8217;t like it, I don&#8217;t want it, it&#8217;s going to die in committee, and it died in the committee from hell. David, on the other hand, let it go through all of the processes. He couldn&#8217;t stop it. The Republicans were voting for it. He pulled the bill and said that the language was weak, so we went through the Senate. The Senate passed the bill, so that put it on a different level because now it had to go through&#8212;        JD: The House.        CD: &#8212;the House and he would not let that bill get to the floor of the House. He wasn&#8217;t man enough to tell us&#8212;like Glenn did&#8212;it&#8217;s not going to happen. He just violated the integrity of the process and would not let the bill get to the floor. So that was 2010. Arizona, however, passed a bill that was modeled after Senate Bill 529 that prohibited an abortion based on race or gender and made it a felony, so Arizona was the first state to pass a civil rights bill for the baby.         JD: Why do you think these issues of race in abortion, why did they come to a boiling point in Georgia in 2009, 2010?         CD: Because we made it come to a boiling point. No one had connected the dots to the racial implications of abortion before Georgia did. Even though Mark Crutcher&#8217;s DVD came out in 2009 Georgia was one of the few states that was brave enough to connect the dots publicly and say there is a racial issue to abortion. Many people were questioning how are you going to prove that, which is why we found the young lady out of Augusta, Georgia that had the firsthand experience. The abortion industry treated her as a woman. They didn&#8217;t need to notify her parents or anything else as long as she was willing to abort on her own, but when she said, &#8220;I want to keep my baby,&#8221; they very quickly terminated the life of her child, so she really didn&#8217;t have a choice. We were the first ones that had the courage to expose it. I think that&#8217;s why.        JD: The billboard campaign made a splash nationally. What was your response to critiques coming around nationally from various corners that this was a racist campaign, or the charges of racism against Georgia Right to Life and toomanyaborted.com?        CD: You know, we had a discussion when we were deciding whether we were going to put the billboard up and whether or not we were going to file the legislation about whether or not Georgia Right to Life should have a prominent role in that process and we had decided no for that reason, because having Georgia Right to Life as a part of it gave the abortion industry wiggle room to deflect the conversation off the topic of is abortion having a detrimental impact on the black community and onto race. That was probably one of the most difficult parts of the campaign because I couldn&#8217;t get people to stay focused and not allow them to deflect off onto these other issues, but to stay focused. We had the numbers on our side, all of the information very clearly shows that there is a racial component to it, and we just needed to articulate that very clearly and stick to it, but it was new and it was too easy for them to pull us off message. So because of that, I think, some of their allegations of racial overtones stuck, especially when it became known that Georgia Right to Life was the funding source for it, and the thing that was interesting is that they never attacked me; they attacked Georgia Right to Life.        JD: They attacked Ryan too.        CD: And they attacked Ryan, yeah, but they never attacked me.        JD: Do you think that&#8217;s because you&#8217;re a black woman?        CD: Because I&#8217;m a black woman with street savvy that could flip it back on them very easily, which is what I did. I did a CNN interview with a gentleman from Al Sharpton&#8217;s network and he was saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re airing our dirty laundry and these white people want to hold our dirty laundry out there for people to see.&#8221; And my bottom line thing was, look: If a black person is not here they don&#8217;t need education. A black dead baby doesn&#8217;t need an education. A black dead baby is not concerned about poverty because they&#8217;re dead. The issue is that we must get our children here, this is the only way we can grow and thrive, and that interview went viral and I&#8217;ve had so many people come back, but it was because of sticking to the point and not deviating off onto, who&#8217;s going to feed these little unwanted children, and all of this other stuff.         JD: Do you think that&#8212;? I can understand that was a difficult decision-making process to take Georgia Right to Life out of the front and who would have to be&#8212;but at the same time with that decision making process that meant that you and Ryan were the primary targets at that point in time. Did you feel like Georgia Right to Life had your back, or, because it&#8217;s still pretty recent but there&#8217;s interesting fallout&#8212;not fallout, that&#8217;s not the right word&#8212;everybody is going their own separate way yet staying together, kind of?        CD: Georgia Right to Life got my back as much as a white organization that doesn&#8217;t understand the black culture can get your back, and so I don&#8217;t fault them. It was new territory. It was blazing a new trail. You didn&#8217;t have a large group of black people that would stand up and say that they were pro-life, so there was no experience from which to draw on this particular issue. But as much as they could, they did the best they could.         JD: How did you feel&#8212;because you got the big national interviews?        CD: Oh yeah, I was in every&#8212;.        JD: And Ryan kind of got&#8212;. He did not get the same national attention. He got a lot of national attention but not an ability to always&#8212;at least he portrayed that in his interview, that he wasn&#8217;t always able to speak up in the same way, or somehow when they did interviews with him the interviews would get cut or something of that sort. I might be reading into his interview, so I hate to do this.         CD: No. Well, let me say this. I was supposed to be the out-front person, not Ryan. Things have evolved since then and Ryan has evolved into a national platform but originally when this campaign first began it did not begin as a platform for Ryan to speak. In fact, we launched it as Operation Outrage, that it was outrageous. We should be outraged at the stuff that we were seeing coming against the black community. So I can&#8217;t gauge that for Ryan because from my understanding back then, when we were going through the planning stages, it was never intended for him to be on the national platform.         JD: I think he acknowledged that. What was your view about SisterSong&#8217;s active response to the campaign?        CD: You know, I was shocked, and I&#8217;m probably&#8212;. Prior to that campaign I would have never called myself politically na&#239;ve, but I really was. I honestly, with every fiber of my being, believed that when I demonstrated very clearly that there was a racial component to abortion that SisterSong, that the black legislators, would rise up and say, &#8220;Whoa, wait a minute.&#8221; I thought we were going to be allies, not adversaries, and I was shocked that SisterSong acknowledged the racial component but still spun information to support this notion that it was rich, white Republican men, or some fictitious person, that was seeking to take away the woman&#8217;s right to choose. I was shocked. I was shocked when Stacey Abrams, who is now the minority leader in the House here in Georgia, avidly fought against Senate Bill 529, just totally ignoring the facts, totally ignoring the data in favor of the abortion industry. I&#8217;m still a little taken aback by it, I really am, because I honestly believed that when we showed that abortion is the last bastion of racism in this nation that all of us would rise up and band together and say, &#8220;Not in my neighborhood.&#8221; And when they fought me as vehemently, and fought Alveda&#8212;. We did a freedom ride. Priest for Life did a freedom ride and I was on that freedom ride and we came from Tennessee to Atlanta&#8212;I&#8217;m sorry, from Alabama to Atlanta&#8212;and we got to the King Center and SisterSong met us and they were chanting, &#8220;Trust black women,&#8221; and the parks service allowed SisterSong to protest us on federal ground but wouldn&#8217;t allow us to stand on federal ground to pray for the lives of the babies that had been taken in abortion. I just was shocked. I&#8217;m still a little dumbfounded about that.        JD: How do you feel about SisterSong&#8217;s &#8220;Trust Black Women&#8221; campaign, which was their response?        CD: I think it&#8217;s spurious. I think Loretta Ross and Heidi and Carlton Veazey and those guys are being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, this is their livelihood, and they will spin it any way they need to spin it to keep getting that money. I don&#8217;t think they care about women, I don&#8217;t think they care about children. They&#8217;re getting paid. They are the modern-day picture of Margaret Sanger&#8217;s Negro project. I believe they&#8217;ve betrayed the black community.        JD: Do you want to talk a little bit about the billboard that just came out on Monday, &#8220;Abortion in the &#8217;hood&#8221;?        CD: Absolutely. Since leaving Georgia Right to Life, I&#8217;ve been&#8212;.        JD: When did you leave? I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t know this fact.        CD: December, 2010.        JD: Okay.        CD: I began to have all of these dreams. It was very bizarre, because I&#8217;m not a dreamer. Usually I fall in the bed and I&#8217;m like a log until the alarm goes off.        JD: Because you&#8217;re a doer. [Laughs]        CD: [Laughs] Yes, I don&#8217;t dream. And I started having these crazy dreams. One of the first dreams I had, I felt like God was saying have a national day of mourning during Black History Month, so one of the first projects that I did after leaving Georgia Right to Life was a national day of mourning, joining forces with national black pro-life leaders like Alveda King, Day Gardner of the National Black Pro-Life Union, Arnold Culbreath of Protecting Black Life, Dean Nelson at that time was with [1:52:04], Stephen Brodan down there at Fair Park Bible [Fellowship] Church in Texas, Johnny Hunter from LEARN. We all came together all around the country and there were fourteen states involved and we asked that each state get at least twenty-five black people to stand and make demands of the government with regard to abortion, and this was all after Kermit Gosnell had been exposed, that abortuary in Pennsylvania that was so heinous. Are you familiar with that?        JD: I remember reading about it but for the sake of the audio recording remind us what that was.        CD: Oh, it was the most god-awful thing, and this is what people don&#8217;t understand. They say that abortion is between a woman and her doctor, but these doctors don&#8217;t even see the women ninety percent of the time until they&#8217;re in between her legs, ripping the baby out. This particular doctor was known to serve black and brown women and he was a late-term abortion specialist. The Drug Enforcement Agency was doing an investigation of him because they had gotten wind that he was selling prescriptions for Oxycontin and Percocet and all these other narcotic drugs, like you paid him fifty bucks and he&#8217;d write you a prescription for however long. So they were investigating him for that and they raided his clinic in Philadelphia and it was the most squalid place that anybody had ever seen. There were cat feces all over the tables that the women were supposed to be on. Apparently when the women were&#8212;. After he induced labor he had them sit in Barcalounger chairs so there was blood all over the chairs, there was blood on the walls. He had babies&#8217; body parts in jars. It was just squalid.         He killed a woman in 2009, so he had called the National Abortion Federation to come in and bless his clinic, to put their stamp of approval on his clinic. The inspector left there saying she had never in all of her years of inspecting abortion clinics seen anything so squalid but she didn&#8217;t warn one woman not to go in there. She didn&#8217;t put a notice out saying, &#8220;Black women, brown women, beware. This place is not a place you want to go to.&#8221; She just packed up her stuff and went home. So the DEA agents that saw the conditions of this place went to the attorney general of Pennsylvania and said you&#8217;ve got to do something, so the attorney general went in there and they shut him down. What they found was he had high school students administering drugs, narcotics, to the women. He would bring them in there, give them [1:55:22 Octocet], which is a drug that induces labor, he would knock them out when they went into labor, they would deliver a live baby and he would cut the baby&#8217;s spinal cord with a pair of scissors. He was a wicked, evil man.         Now the health department in Pennsylvania knew about him because he was so filthy he wasn&#8217;t cleaning the instruments in between visits so he was passing venereal diseases from woman to woman and many doctors began to complain, saying my patient&#8212;many real doctors&#8212;went to this guy and now they have a venereal disease, but the health department wouldn&#8217;t even inspect them. Even though over a fifteen year period they got complaint after complaint after complaint, they turned a blind eye. Many people felt it was because he was serving black and brown women. Pennsylvania had a twenty-four hour waiting period. He broke that law every day of the week because the women would come in there and if they saw how squalid it was and he thought they were going to leave he would tell them, &#8220;No, stay, I&#8217;ll do your abortion today,&#8221; and he would immediately give them the medication and take the lives of their babies. So the woman that he killed, they had chained the door that the ambulance could have easily gotten up. It was chained, they couldn&#8217;t find the key, so they had great difficulty even getting her downstairs to try to render aid to her and she died.         So the national day of mourning, national leaders from around the country convened&#8212;.        JD: Was it a black woman who died, or a woman of color?        CD: A woman of color. She was [1:57:17]. I don&#8217;t know what that name is. Like, I don&#8217;t know&#8212;Indian maybe? So on the national day of mourning Alveda, Day Gardner, [1:57:33] from New Jersey, Stephen Brodan, Arnold Culbreath, they all convened in Pennsylvania in front of that clinic, and then each state had their own site, like I was down at the state capitol here in Georgia, and we were asking the governors of every state to enforce the medical standards laws that are already on the books and make sure that if these clinics are supposed to be licensed ambulatory clinics that they are licensed and they are maintaining medical standards of care, the minimum medical standards of care. We were asking Congress to defund Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the nation, and we were asking the states to, if they didn&#8217;t already have laws that would address the situation that happened in Pennsylvania that they develop laws, and there were fourteen states: Tennessee, Mississippi, New York City, Alabama, California&#8212;.        JD: A lot from the South, it sounds like.        CD: Yes. We had a lot from the South. North Carolina, California, Missouri, Kansas, Indiana, Ohio, all of these states did events in their state, but of course the mainstream media didn&#8217;t cover it but we did it.         So after that I went to get my hair done, and I don&#8217;t know if you know anything about black hair but it is&#8212;.        JD: Just what&#8217;s in the Chris Rock documentary and my friends. [Laughs]        CD: Oh, cool, okay.        JD: It&#8217;s a culture of its own.        CD: Of its own, and when you go into a black hair salon you&#8217;re going to be there for at least two to three hours. Well, my stylist was doing my hair and he was telling me about this thing that he was engaged in with L&#8217;Or&#233;al where he was going out into the streets and talking about HIV/AIDS in the black community and he said, &#8220;You should do something like that for abortion.&#8221; I was like, wow, that&#8217;s a great idea. So I had a dream about it: Go to the hair show and give out information, so it was like, cool.        JD: You&#8217;re talking about the Atlanta&#8212;.        CD: Bronner Brothers&#8217; Hair Show that was in&#8212;        JD: That documentary, yeah.        CD: &#8212;Good Hair. Well that is this weekend.        JD: Oh!        CD: And I have rented a booth and we will be in there encouraging the hairstylists to talk about the numbers. Regardless of your position on abortion, can you at least have this conversation with your clientele? So we are going to give them a copy of the DVD, Maafa 21, we are going to give them a card that I will show you that has the statistics on it, we&#8217;re going to give them a copy of a publication called &#8220;Did You Know&#8221; that has a lot of information about the impact of abortion on the black community, and then I am going to give them a window decal that they can put in the window of their shop that says, &#8220;I participate in Life Talks.&#8221; So we&#8217;re going to be down there, so that&#8217;s going to be fifty thousand-plus barbers and hair dressers descending on Atlanta, Georgia this weekend.         So while I was doing that I also had a dream and I saw this billboard that said, &#8220;Betrayed: abortioninthehood.com,&#8221; and I said well what if we put the billboard up at the same time that the fifty thousand black barbers and hairdressers are coming into town, then they would see it along with all of the other traffic that&#8217;s coming downtown to go to Centennial Olympic Park and the CNN Center and the Phillips Arena or whatever. So, we have purchased a super board, it&#8217;s about twenty by fifty&#8212;it&#8217;s huge&#8212;that has the &#8220;Betrayed: abortioninthehood.com.&#8221; When you come to the website you will see Jesse Jackson, who started out as pro-life, writing for national Right to Life, and then he flip flopped in the 1980s and started saying that he couldn&#8217;t tell a woman that she didn&#8217;t have the right to choose because it was the law of the land. You will see all of the numbers of abortions on black women in the states that report by race and then you will see the statement by Ruth Bader Ginsburg that there was a concern about population when Roe was decided and Roe was the case that was going to enable us to take care of the populations that we have too many of. Then you will see three of Georgia&#8217;s four black Congressmen, and the Congressional Black Caucus says they&#8217;re the conscience of the Congress, that they give voice to the voiceless, and yet on this issue they are giving voice to the abortionist because they have not even looked to see if abortion is having a horrific impact on the black community. They are not asking any questions about why sixty percent of the abortions in the state of Georgia are on black women or why a hundred percent of the abortion clinics in this state are located in urban areas where blacks reside, and we want them to stop it. We want them to investigate, look at it, and explain these numbers, so that&#8217;s the &#8220;Betrayed&#8221; campaign. So this weekend that billboard will be seen by all of the people coming to the Bronner Brothers&#8217; Hair Show as well as anyone else who&#8217;s moseying through downtown Atlanta.        JD: Do you have it up for the week or is it a longer rental?        CD: It will be up for three weeks. It will be up through the first week in September, so hundreds of thousands of people if not a million or more will see that billboard before it comes down.         JD: So you&#8217;re in the middle of excitement right now.        CD: I really am, and I&#8217;m having a ball. And I know I&#8217;m doing something right because every step of the way with the Sampson Project has been a fight. I got a small grant to pay for all of the different pieces, getting the&#8212;        JD: That grant-writing ability has come in handy.        CD: &#8212;come in handy&#8212;getting the DVDs and the cards and all of that, and the bank got the money and they held it for eight days so I couldn&#8217;t pay any bills. I went to a company to get the presentation folders. I originally was going to give out bags but because we ran out of time and I didn&#8217;t have the money to pay for it, because those kind of things you have to pay in advance, we decided to do presentation folders as an alternative and we got the information to them but they wouldn&#8217;t start printing until they had check in hand. Well, because the bank was holding the money I couldn&#8217;t write the check, which meant I was getting closer and closer to my deadline date. They were supposed to ship the folders in time for me to stuff them, they were supposed to ship them yesterday; they may go out tonight, and I had to pay a thousand dollars to have them overnighted so that I could get them in time. While I&#8217;m sitting in the salon I get a phone call from the decal people saying, &#8220;We had printing and production issues so do you really need to have this or can we give it to you Saturday?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, I need it by Thursday because I&#8217;ve got to put the information into packets,&#8221; and so now they&#8217;re having to overnight their things. It has been a fight but I am believing God that this is going to be the breakthrough that we need.        JD: What has been the reaction of&#8212;? I mean you obviously have emails back and forth. What have been some of the reactions from the black community in Atlanta to your billboard campaigns, your activism?        CD: I don&#8217;t know because I think the average person believes what we&#8217;re saying and they support what we&#8217;re saying but SisterSong and those guys so spun the information, I honestly don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t have a good gauge. When I have done screenings of Maafa 21 I have had people look at me with tears streaming down their faces and saying, I did not know. What can I do? So when I am able to get to African American people directly and share the information with them they become a part of the building army to make it stop. But looking at how the mainstream media spins it, they&#8217;re spinning it as if we&#8217;re the problem, not abortion, so I honestly don&#8217;t know. But what I am finding with &#8220;Betrayed&#8221; in the interviews I&#8217;ve done so far, it&#8217;s real hard to argue with these kind of numbers. I haven&#8217;t heard from SisterSong and them yet so I don&#8217;t know what their response is, but it&#8217;s just hard to deal with the numbers, and the only thing we&#8217;re asking is that our elected officials and our so-called leaders look at it. Something is wrong, something is broken, when we have these kind of numbers presenting all over the country, not in every community but only in the black community. Even in states where blacks are only one or two percent of the population they&#8217;re getting four or five, twenty percent of the abortions. How can that be, if there&#8217;s no targeting?         JD: If you had to articulate the link between civil rights and your right to life, pro-life activism, how would you articulate that?        CD: That the civil rights movement did not end with the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It simply put a suit on and went underground in the form of Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. They had to decide what they were going to do to control the black birthrate and it was a conscious decision. Just like it was a conscious decision to sterilize so many blacks through the eugenics boards, in the 1970s and the 1980s that same thing is a conscious decision with the location of the abortion clinics and who they are trying to reach. Who do they market to? You don&#8217;t see advertisements in white urban areas for Planned Parenthood or for the abortion clinic. You can go online and search. You&#8217;re not seeing even a lot of commentary, outside of the Huffington Post  kind of posts]. You see it more coming from black voices than white voices. Well why is that? Why is it that they say that black women have more unintended pregnancies?         Where do black children go to school? Planned Parenthood is in those schools teaching those children how to have sex, not teaching them about safe sex but they&#8217;re telling them how to have oral sex, how to have anal sex, how to have all different kinds of sex. If you go to some of their websites there were two things that I saw that were so offensive to me that I just refused to go back on their sites. One was a penis talking to a vagina, both dressed up like they&#8217;re going to a ball, and the penis is talking to the vagina. The other one was a clip called, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t spew,&#8221; and it&#8217;s this young white guy and he&#8217;s standing there with this really goofy look on his face and this guidance-counselor kind of guy is walking by and he backs up and he says, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t protect it you got to reject it,&#8221; and the guy&#8217;s like, [2:11:54] and a young black man stands up and wipes his mouth. And every time I even think about that one I just&#8212;. [Becomes emotional] They&#8217;re targeting our young people and they are doing it without reservation, unfettered, unchecked, and by golly if it&#8217;s the last thing I do I&#8217;m going to scream about it from the top of my lungs. [Pause] I just&#8212;. [With emotion] That one just always sets me off. I&#8217;m sorry.         But I&#8217;m going to fight it, and even if it means fighting some of my own black people, because some of them have betrayed us. Some of them have made it seem like they&#8217;re helping us when in fact they&#8217;re promoting the very death style that is killing us, and it&#8217;s time that it stop, and that&#8217;s what I want to work for and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been working for. So I started my own organization, the Restoration Project, and I&#8217;m going to proclaim the truth as long as God gives me breath to proclaim it, and if I die, you know, somebody shoots me, then you pull this tape out and you play it and you tell people [With emphasis] that they&#8217;ve got to fight it, because to me this is the last bastion of racism. They are not going into white urban areas. They&#8217;re not going in to Alpharetta, Georgia, which is up the street and around the corner, and saying, &#8220;Kill your babies.&#8221; They&#8217;re not going to Forsyth, Georgia, where blacks have been so unwelcome for so many years and saying, &#8220;Kill your babies.&#8221; They are here in DeKalb where I live. They&#8217;re in south Fulton where the city of Atlanta is. They&#8217;re not even in north Fulton; they&#8217;re in south Fulton. Something has to give. And they&#8217;re bold with it and they&#8217;ve learned the civil rights lingo and so they chant it. SisterSong stood on the MLK grounds and said we were co-opting the civil rights movement. What makes them more black than me? I&#8217;m saying you are the Negro Project 2.0. You&#8217;re the modern-day version of what Margaret Sanger embraced and applauded and is paying you for. SisterSong gets over a million dollars a year to do what they do. Carlton Veazey gets paid a hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars for five hours of work a week to proclaim this message of death in the black community. I don&#8217;t know how much money Jesse Jackson got when he ran for President from the likes of Planned Parenthood and NARAL and the NAF and all the rest of them, but I know that it&#8217;s time that it stops because we won&#8217;t be here if it doesn&#8217;t.        JD: What do you want to say to black women like yourself who have aborted? Have any of them contacted you since the campaign came out and what have you said to them?        CD: Since the &#8220;Betrayed&#8221; campaign or the &#8220;Endangered Species&#8221;?        JD: &#8220;Endangered Species&#8221;.        CD: Every place that I go to speak, it seems that there&#8217;s one or two women in the crowd who are willing to admit that they&#8217;re post-abortive, and they go into a wail and they&#8217;re crying and they&#8217;re like, what did I do? Those women, I pray with them. I point them to resources where they can get help to manage their grief and then I enlist them in the growing army to stand against this practice that has so easily overtaken the black community. I tell them that just like Jesus forgave me, if they ask he&#8217;ll forgive them, and if they&#8217;re willing to ask I will pray with them right there on the spot. Then I point them to resources. Usually everywhere I go, I will have a representative with me from one of the pregnancy care centers. They offer post-abortive counseling, they offer immediate help to women who are abortion minded and/or who are post-abortive so I try to always have some resources right there with me that can talk to the women and pray with them. I frequently go to abortion clinics&#8212;. Well not frequently because just like that video clip trips me out, it trips me out to stand in front of an abortion clinic and see how many black women are just streaming in there. My heart just can&#8217;t take it. But I pray with Bound4LIFE. Those are the people that put the red tape over their mouths that says &#8220;life&#8221; and they do sieges in front of clinics. I pray with them and I siege with them.                        JD: Is there anything you&#8217;d like to add at this point in time?        CD: I think we&#8217;re at a historic moment. I think the tide is turning and I think that if we stay the course and not shrink back from the fight that we will prevail. I do not believe that the Supreme Court is ever going to overturn Roe v. Wade. They don&#8217;t have a history of doing the right thing. They don&#8217;t have a history of deciding cases rightly. When slavery was legal they did the case&#8212;.        JD: Dred Scott?        CD: Dred Scott case that said black people were property, so we had a war [Laughs] and it was like, no, and we got the thirteenth and the fourteenth amendments that guaranteed us due process of law. So then they did Plessy v. Ferguson, which said that we were separate but equal, and it wasn&#8217;t until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that we were able to gain &#8220;equal rights&#8221; and some of the barriers that had been erected were pulled down. Well&#8212;.        JD: You just put equal in quotes. You signaled quotes. [Laughs]        CD: Oh, yes, I did signal quotes, because we&#8217;re still not equal, because after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in short order we got Roe v. Wade and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it. It&#8217;s in the footnotes of the opinion. They were eugenicists and they want to control the black birthrate. So as we continue to expose that and as the blinders come off I think we win, and so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m committed to. I&#8217;m committed to telling the truth, and I will fight this as long as God gives me breath.        JD: Well thank you so much for your time today.        CD: Thank you for asking me.
