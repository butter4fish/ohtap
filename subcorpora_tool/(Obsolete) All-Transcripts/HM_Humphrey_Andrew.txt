Speaker 2: Yes, it's Clifton, CLIFTON and I have a Junior at the end of my name.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is your date of birth and place of birth
Speaker 2: My date of birth, well I like to say I was born on September 22nd, and my place of birth was Silver Spring, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you give us a year?
Speaker 2: The only thing that I'm always hesitant about is just giving the year I was born, I'm just a typical TV [television] person.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That's the only thing I probably won't answer today.
Speaker 1: Well it will be an oral history, it's going to be implied in here somewhere.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, don't worry, I'll give the real dates of when I graduated schools and things like that, so--
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And sir what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Meteorologist and Reporter at WDIV, Local 4, and that's a TV station in Detroit, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is Thursday, October 25th, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Right now we're in the building of WDIV.
Story_ID: 23151
Speaker 1: Okay now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight, and they're lightweight questions we ask as sort of a warm-up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we're keeping track of these, so we have to ask them.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food, wow, almost anything really.  Some of the first things that come to mind are spaghetti, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate ice cream, those are a few.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It's always hard to narrow it down to one.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue and purple.
Speaker 1: Okay a favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: Boy, well-being a meteorologist, any time of year.  I enjoy all the things each season has to offer, especially living here in Michigan and where I was born and raised in Maryland, in the DC [District of Columbia] area.  So virtually any time of year is great for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Let's see, most of the time I'm a homebody, but lately I've been really getting into the National park System of the United States.  I really enjoy the beauty of nature and all it has to offer.  So some of my favorite destinations are just the national parks that are here in the U.S. [United States].
Speaker 1: Okay and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase or saying.  Maybe things I say to people, especially my audience, like have a wonderful day.  This is your day to make a difference.  This is your day to make a great impression and Mother Nature is going to help you out.  Those are some of my favorites.
Story_ID: 23152
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but separately and then bring them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My mother's name is Susanne, S-U-S-A-N-N-E, middle initial M, Humphrey, H-U-M-P-H-R-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And what about her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Kriss, K-R-I-S-S.
Speaker 1: All right and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 1st 1945, place of birth, Shanghai, China.
Speaker 1: Okay now there must be a story behind her being born in Shanghai.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I take it we'll get to that later or do you want me to talk about it now?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.  My mother again was born in Shanghai, China.  Now the reason why that is my grandmother and grandfather, they're of European descent.  My grandmother was born and raised, born and raised in what's--let me start over again, is that all right?  Well it's all raw.
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: With my mother, she was born in Shanghai, China.  The interesting story behind that is she's actually--my grandmother and grandfather are actually of European descent.  My grandmother was born in what's now Romania and grew up basically in Vienna, Austria, and that's where she met my grandfather and eventually married him.  But that was at the time that [Adolf] Hitler was coming to power, so they had to flee because they were Jewish.  And one of the only places in the world that was accepting Jews at the time, it was not the United States, it was actually Shanghai, China.  So that's where they fled and that's why my mother was born in Shanghai.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is your mother Jewish as well?
Speaker 2: My mother's also Jewish.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So they fled to China during World War II [1939-1945].
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: I could probably trace back, although I don't know the names by heart, but I've done some family tree research myself and stored it on my computer.  But I can go back at least to my great-grandmother and great-grandfather on my mother's side.  I may be able to go farther back, further back that is, but I just don't know at this time.  When my grandmother and grandfather fled before they had my mother, my, my mother is a, is an only child.  My grandmother has a sister and she was able to get out also.  Now my great-aunt essentially was not able to flee to Shanghai [China] but she was able to reach safe haven elsewhere in Europe, but with her, she also got married and so I have some relatives based on that.  Because I say that because also I'm an only child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But as it, as it comes to my mind, my mother was, was an only child to her mother and father biologically.  She actually had a stepbrother who was actually--who was not able to get out of Europe, was actually survived one of the concentration camps, but only as a little boy and unfortunately after World War II he survived the camps, but when he was a teenager he became ill.  And unfortunately passed away when he was just a teenager in his mid-teens.
Speaker 1: Was it from complications of the concentration camp when he was younger?
Speaker 2: I don't know the origin of his, the disease that he caught, but unfortunately it was of course bad enough where he was not able to get well.
Speaker 1: It makes you wonder when people are treated that badly, starved and you know if they, if they suffer, you know, later on in life from you know --
Speaker 2: Yeah well you know my mother and I talked about that.  Well my mother revealed that to me a few short years ago and yeah we, we've had some interesting conversations about that.  One of the things that's striking that she and I talk about, and I really think about to this day is just what you mentioned, quality of life.  And I think about that a lot based on my diet now.  I basically stay away from meat, mainly for health purposes.  But now when I think about quality of life issues, I think about it sometimes not only for human beings, but also for other, other living beings because I just can't imagine what it must have been like for my mother's stepbrother to have grown up that way.  First as a toddler and a child having to suffer through World War II and the concentration camps.  And even after victory in World War II and getting his freedom, then coming down with a deadly disease and having to live through that and then die at such a young age.
Speaker 1: Okay now can you give us the names of your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Let's see, on my mother's side, Amalee [ph.] Kriss and Richard Kriss, that's what I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay now is there a, is Kriss an abbreviation of a longer name?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, I don't think so.  I think Kriss is just Kriss.  I really haven't, let me see, nothing comes to mind right now.  I don't know, I don't know if it stands for a longer name or not.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But my, but yeah when my grandmother and my grand--it was my grandmother and my mom who made it eventually here to the United States.  My grandfather was not able to make it, speaking of disease.  So my mother was born in 1945 in Shanghai.  After World War II [1939-1945], my grandmother, grandfather and my mom, they come back through Europe on the way to the United States.  One of the last stops in Europe was Paris, France and that was just before coming to the U.S.  My mother and grandmother were able to come over here to the United States but while they were in Paris [France], my grandfather contracted tuberculosis and for that medical reason he could not come to the United States.  And ultimately he passed away while in Paris.
Speaker 1: Well this is pretty, this is a really horrendous story so far of struggle, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah and my mother's really, my mother's done a, a herculean job of documenting that family history mainly through the reparations process with the country of Austria.  And that's where, that's where she and I, well that's where she mainly discovers a lot of this part of our family history, or my family history that is.  Well it is our, our shared family history.  And that's how we get to talk about it.  It is quite amazing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's amazing more than just horrendous I guess, you know.
Speaker 2: Well I mean it signifies, I mean what the human struggle is all about and just how, just the willingness and, and amazing ability for human beings to survive no matter what the cost.  Not only survive for themselves, but try and take care of their family members and take care, take care of their fellow human beings and try to help them survive too.
Speaker 1: Okay now did your grandmother have relatives in the United States when she came over, or did she come over just-
Speaker 2: My grandmother had a sister named Etta [ph.].  She made it over to the United States also.  She eventually had children, three boys, so they would be my cousins, second cousins if I'm not mistaken.  And then they eventually had children.  But they were able to make it over here to the United States also.
Speaker 1: Okay but no one was already here when she came over.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  First time to the United States on my mother's side of the family was yes, my mother, my grandmother and my great-aunt.
Speaker 1: Okay so what did your grandmother do when she, when she got to--did she settle in--
Speaker 2: She settled, if I'm not--well on the east coast, eventually settling in Baltimore.  I remember visiting her several times when she was alive when I was a child.  And basically raised my mother on her own.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So she settled in--and she originally was from Romania I think you said, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but what's now Romania, and spent a lot of her--but then eventually moved and spent a lot of her childhood or young adulthood in Vienna, Austria.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact when the Nazis came for my grandmother and grandfather, they were living in Nazi, excuse me, they were living in Vienna, Austria at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Again, when my grandmother and grandfather were being harassed by the Nazis, or had to flee from the Nazis, they were living in Vienna, Austria at the time.
Story_ID: 23153
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now, now what did your mother [Susanne Humphrey]--did she have any stories about growing up Baltimore or, or, or how old was she when she made the trip to the U.S., I mean--
Speaker 2: Boy, she must have been, she must have been four or five years old and in fact recently, this again is earlier this year, 2012, she shared with me some pictures and passports on the, the trek they took from Shanghai [China] going back to Europe.  It was very interesting.  She showed me a picture--they made a stopover in Sri Lanka and she had a picture while they were there.  And this must have been only for a day or, or for a few days, and including the passports that they used.  And these were passports and/or papers that not only had Chinese stamps written on them, but also stamps that listed Sri Lanka.  But on the front of those stamps, they were from what at the time was the Nazi Empire.  So they had the Swastika and the German emblem on it and everything.  Still intact also.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, so they were living in China prior to, you know a section of China that wasn't taken over by Mao Tse-tung [also known as Mao Zedong; a communist revolutionary from China] I guess until--
Speaker 2: Right there were a couple of documentaries, my grandparents were not in those documentaries but there were a couple of documentaries about the Jews as they--many of the Jews that actually fled to Shanghai.  One of those documentaries is called 'Shanghai Ghetto'.  And what I remember from that documentary was that there was a zone in, in Shanghai called the International Zone in which it was, you know separated.  When people eventually settled, settled there, I think many of them naturally separated into their own nationalities or their own ethnicities, and one of those was, was the Jewish ethnicity.  So that's what I remember from that movie.  So I think that's where they settled.  My grandmother and grandfather had a medical background, including my grandfather who was an OB/GYN [obstetrician/gynecologist], and my grandmother assisted him.  So that was the type of practice that, that he and they had as adults while they were in Shanghai, China.
Speaker 1: So your grandmother served as sort of a nurse to, I guess sort of an assistant now?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Sort of a nurse, a nurse or an assistant to my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.  So now where did your mother go, go to school in Baltimore, or what part of town?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I don't remember the names of the high schools, but I remember she did eventually go to the University of Maryland and she studied German there.  She got a degree in German and then went on to work.  But oddly enough, she went to work also in the medical field, but she worked at the National Library of Medicine and there she was an Information Scientist.  She's very humble about it, but I really call--I really say that she was one of the, she was part of the team or she was one of the people who were the brains behind the Google of the medical field at the National Institutes of Health.  The National Library of Medicine has a website called Medline, and you still might be able to access it at medline.gov, and that's where you can search for all things dealing with medicine, diseases, conditions, symptoms and she was one of the ones, not one of the programmers, but one of the folks who would devise ways of indexing, helping users understand or get the results they want when they put in different, different search terms.  If they put in heart disease, they might be looking for something very specific but not know it.  So helping, helping that search engine guide the, guide users to find what it is they want to on the Internet in terms of medicine at the, the National Institutes of Health.
Speaker 1: Okay, sounds, yeah she--sounds, sounds like a trained librarian in a lot of ways.  Did she have any library training at all, or--
Speaker 2: Not that I know of, no.  Like I said, it was, like I said she got her degree in German but as far as I know, she really never had to put that to use.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Yeah that, that's a job that you would not think of in the first grade when they say what, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And maybe growing up at that time also when it comes to women and science.  But yeah my mom always had, always had a very analytical side to her and I think that's where a lot of my analytical side comes from, as well as from my father.  But yeah she's always never been afraid to, to follow it.  She's always basically enjoyed doing what she likes.
Story_ID: 23154
Speaker 1: Okay now let's go to your father's side.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's Andrew Clifton Humphrey, Senior, so it's spelled the same way my name is spelled.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is November 23rd, 1927, and his place of birth is Jacksonville, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is Jacksonville near that we might know in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Camp Lejeune.
Speaker 1: Camp Lejeune, okay.
Speaker 2: A very well known Marine base, and that's in the southeast portion of North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now how far back can you trace your father's side?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I've done this recently also.  I, I remember learning in 2008--well growing up my grandmother and grandfather--my grandfather's name was Amos Humphrey.  My grandmother's name is Mandy, and her maiden name was Bunche with an E at the end.  And then beyond that I learned in 2008 my great-grandfather's name was, my great-grandfather's name I learned in 2008 is George Washington Humphrey, but I forget what his wife's name was.  I have it written down and I have that in my computer also.  But I--my--a lot of my relatives on my father's side who are still in North Carolina, they've done a very good job of documenting what my family history is on my, on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, now kind of smiling at George Washington Humphrey cause it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I have to tell you a story about George Washington in the Civil, it was during the Civil War [1861-1865].
Speaker 2: Yeah?
Speaker 1: That name, you know everybody wanted to--
Speaker 2: Is your name connect--I mean is your family--is any of your family history mixed in with the first President [George Washington]?
Speaker 1: No, but I heard this story about how so many former slaves wanted to be called George Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That they, they devised different last names for them because everybody wanted to have George Washington in the, in the name.
Speaker 2: I've heard that also, but mainly--during that time about presidents in general, that many, many African Americans at that time wanted to name their, their children after the names of presidents that they admired.  And of course as you said, George Washington was one of those.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay.  So are there any stories that go back to slavery days on your father's side?
Speaker 2: On my father's side, I just remember my, my father would tell me that my, my granddad was a Baptist preacher and we come from a family of sharecroppers.  I remember that.  As far as more detailed history like what boat they were on and so on, that I do not know at the time.
Speaker 1: Hardly anyone knows that, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I just wondered--
Speaker 2: As far as the slavery--as far as the actual slave experience, I always had the impression that the slave experience may have been relatively short compared to other African American families and other, other descendants of--other folks from the African Diaspora.  I do remember, although I don't remember the names going back in my--going back in my family line deeper than George Washington Humphrey, there were other folks on the side of my family that were already integrated either by, either by force or by love.  There were European Americans who loved and had relationships with African Americans at the time.  Again, it may have been by force, it may have been by love.  But I remember that--I remember hearing about that and seeing that at least documented by name or in, or in the family tales that, that I listened to when I researched it a little bit more.
Speaker 1: Okay so family stories and, and research indicates there's, there's a lot of European ancestry on your father's side.
Speaker 2: Yeah I think, I think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah I think there is some other European ancestry on my father's side.  And I'm still searching and, and learning more about that.
Speaker 1: And what makes you think that they were only in slavery a brief period of time?  Because there were, there a lot of, there were freed black people in the cities of the south, especially in those days.
Speaker 2: I just happen to remember--I just happen to remember in 2008 when I would speak to some of my relatives that--as far back as, okay I've gone back to great-grandfather.  As far back as great, great-grandfather and/or great, great, great-grandfather which would definitely put us in the 1800s, that some of my relatives were very light skinned and could almost pass for white.  It was still a question of whether they were fully Caucasian or European, or had a mixture of Caucasian and/or African American or maybe even Native American, primarily African American, but those questions I don't have the answer to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't, and I'm, and I'm, I am unclear about any relatives of mine who may have--I, I'm unclear about how far back my line goes on my father's side here in the United States.  I don't know if it started in the--I don't know if my African ancestors were brought over in the 1500s, 1600s or 1700s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is it--now, now was your, your father raised on a, on a farm himself, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My, my--the family on my father's side, they grew tobacco.  I remember that and so yeah my father was, was born and raised basically on a farm.  And like I said, they were sharecroppers and growing tobacco.
Story_ID: 23155
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so did dad [Andrew Clifton Humphrey], dad have any stories about race relations in those days or going to school or anything?
Speaker 2: He always told me this story and I think it maybe forms my, my, my take on race and/or racism to this day.  Like I said my grandfather was a Baptist preacher.  And my grandfather was a Baptist preacher and he would preach not only in Jacksonville [North Carolina], but other places in North, in North Carolina and maybe other parts of the south.  But basically would travel a little bit.  And on his travels, he would also preach, he would also happen to preach with white preachers.  And so my dad recounted the story where he was with my, my grandfather--my dad was real small at the time, I think pre-teen.  And he was with my grandfather at the time and this other white preacher.  And my father keenly noticed that blacks had to be in one area and whites could go in another area and they was separation or segregation going on.  And my father being a child was, was fine with simply asking this white preacher why that is, and whether there was something wrong with black folks at the time or something wrong with himself.  And he told me that this white preacher looked at him and said you know what Andrew, that might be the way it is right now, but all people are equal in God's eyes.  And my dad really took that to heart from an early, early child, understanding that really we were all equal and all deserved the same rights and the same sort of respect and responsibilities as any other human being on this plant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So in terms of race and what my father has conveyed to me over his experience with his experience with race or racism at the time, that's one of the stories that stands out in my mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your father, I guess when the time that he was being raised, there was pretty much total segregation in North Carolina in terms of schools and public facilities.  So did he--now did he have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, he, he went to college.  He went to St. Aug [St. Augustine College] which is North Carolina.  Got his degree there and then eventually moved to the north and that's where--
Speaker 1: This is saint; this is Saint Augustine, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, St. Augustine College in, in North Carolina.  Got his degree there and then moved north to the [Washington] D.C. area.  Well he was in the Army at first.  Never had to fight overseas, but it was at the time of the Korean War [1950-1953] and he was actually a barber for the United States Army.  I think he stayed in the Deep South.  I don't remember him telling me stories about him being stationed somewhere else in the country, certainly not overseas.  But he was a barber so all my life as a, as a kid, I, I never had to go to the barbershop.  I didn't have to worry about going to the barbershop till I went to college, really.  But anyway, so Dad, he went to college at St. Aug, moved up to--went into the Army, then moved to DC.
Speaker 1: Now, now what did he major in in college?
Speaker 2: What did he major in?  That's a good question.  I don't know if it was straight out education or not.  He eventually became a teacher, I know that.  He eventually became a, a teacher and school administrator for D.C. public schools, that's Washington, D.C. public schools and Montgomery County public schools.  He was also being part of--also being part of the school system; he also coached basketball and coached baseball for a time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was he, was he good at sports?
Speaker 2: His, his--even though he coached baseball and basketball, his main passion was golf.  And before there was a Tiger Woods, my dad wanted me to be the first African American to win the Masters [the Masters Tournament is one of four professional golf tournaments].  But unfortunately I didn't have the same sort of passion or drive for golf that he did.  Now despite that, we still played golf a lot.  I remember in the summer time nearly every single weekend he'd wake me up at six or seven in the morning and we'd go out and play at least nine holes of golf somewhere where I was growing up
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Before I forget, I think my father also went to graduate school and he got a Master's, I forgot what the Master's was in, but I think that was at American University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did he do barbering as a--on the side, or did he just do it at home?
Speaker 2: No he--I remember growing up he never really did it for money or anything, he just did it for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I get that sense also when he was younger, I don't think he did it for extra money.  He first worked--actually before he started teaching, he first worked as a Medical Technician in the DC and Baltimore area before moving on to teaching.
Story_ID: 23156
Speaker 1: Okay now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  You know what?  It's a simple story.  They [his parents: Susanne Humphrey and Andrew Clifton Humphrey] actually just met at a dance club and hit it off, formed a relationship and eventually got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Was there any particular style of dance?  You know I'm just thinking when you got, like funk going on, you got disco maybe.  I mean disco hadn't really started yet before you were born, but let's see.  You're the only child, go-go hadn't started yet, not till the '80's [1980's], so--
Speaker 2: My dad always said he was a good dancer, but we never really talked about styles of dance or anything.  I don't know if that was passed down to me naturally or not.  I really wasn't really--I really wasn't comfortable with dancing until I got into college.  And even before then I knew I eventually had to get comfortable with it if I wanted to meet girls, so I remember at the end of high school, this was my senior year of high school, probably before going to college.  Some of my friends who were better dancers than I was, I was, I would ask them how do you, how do you dance, how do you do it?  And they just--they just started--they just basically said well you just simply start moving to the music.  And first start with your head, it can start with your hands or your feet, you can almost, you can almost walk in place and then just start adding little moves to it.  So that's what I, that's basically what I did.  I don't know how it looked.  I didn't get any complaints.  But my dad I remember, he fashioned himself as a very good dancer.  He never taught me how to dance, I guess I never got up the nerve to ask him if he could teach me, I relied on my friends.  But I think eventually turned out okay.  He never saw me dance, but I, I think he might be proud.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23157
Speaker 1: All right now, now in--now this is--your parents meet--when would you say that they met?  About what year?
Speaker 2: Late '60's [1960's], early '70's [1970's], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now we still had a segregated America.  And so your mother's [Susanne Humphrey] white, father's [Andrew Clifton Humphrey] black.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I don't, I don't know what color black he was, but it doesn't, sometimes it doesn't matter.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  Yeah it doesn't matter what shade of black you are in the United States.
Speaker 1: But did they have any trouble you know was there any trepidation on, on the part of either one?
Speaker 2: Of course I don't remember that when I was really small, when I was an infant or a toddler.  All I, all I can do is just remember what my dad said.  And my dad really said they--okay, my dad always said that there really wasn't much trouble.  He recalls an incident where we're growing up, I was growing up in Bethesda [Maryland], we were all living in Bethesda in an apartment at the time.  And he recalls some gentleman who happened to be white who were living down the hallways, hallway.  And one night they were making a lot of noise and they were running through and supposedly banging on doors and things of that sort.  And my dad always suspected that they banged on our door more frequently because it was my mom and dad living there and they were a mixed race couple with a, with an interracial child.  So my dad's never been one to really back down from anything.  So he confronted them, not physically but he knew where they lived essentially and knocked back on their door.  They opened it up and he basically asked them or told them to please stop doing that and if they basically had a problem, maybe there would be an opportunity to talk about it later.  But he tells me that after he confronted them, that they didn't do it again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's one of the things that I remember.  And the only other things that I recall that my mom and dad ever, ever said was not really trouble like not being admitted anywhere.  But as I was growing up, people taking second takes when I'd be out with either both of them or primarily with my mom.  In particular when we'd go to the zoo or maybe to the grocery store or something like that, people would ask me if I happened to walk away from my mom or still close by, little boy are you lost?  Not realizing that my mother was actually standing right there.  She might be of a different color, but she was still my mom.  And my mom would politely say no, no he's with me.  And then that's--then we would go on about our ways.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Now when you consider your parents' dispositions or personalities, their mentalities, their hobbies, their looks, their gate, you know.  Who, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Boy when I think about it, I always think that I'm almost the perfect melding of both of them.  My mother's [Susanne Humphrey] more introverted than my father [Andrew Clifton Humphrey], my father is extroverted.  My mother's more quiet, my father's more outspoken.  They're both different dispositions and I think I carry both of them just simply by--not just being borne from them, but also simply observing them and growing up in that environment with both, with both of them there.  I think my--I, I mentioned my father, my father never being shy to speak up.  My father would--if he ever--if he perceived that talking about trouble that would, that would happen, if he perceived for any reason, not necessarily because of racism or something like that.  If he perceived that he wasn't getting serviced properly at a restaurant or at a store or something like that, he would openly talk more loudly and be more demanding of the service person that was supposed to treat him respectfully, same thing at work also.  He would tell me stories sometimes about you know how work place politics goes.  Well if he felt, if he felt he was on the odd side of workplace politics, he wouldn't have any problem confronting folks, whether they were his peers or whether they were his boss.  I don't know if that got him into trouble regularly because he was able to be gainfully employed, consistently employed, at least during the time that I, that I was being raised.  But my mother was a lot different.  My mother would still recognize if there was any sort of disrespect or, or challenge that was going on, but she'd have more the attitude of--and she'd have more the attitude of not letting it pass, but definitely sort of fighting through it, but fighting through it quietly.  If there was a barrier, my father would break through it.  If there was a barrier, my mother would still get to the end point on the other side, but just simply go around it.
Story_ID: 23159
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now do you have now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory, my earliest, when I think about my earliest childhood memory is my fourth birthday.  I just remember it was in the, in the nursery school which is, I was growing--again growing up in Bethesda [Maryland] in an apartment complex in Bethesda.  There was a child care center in one of the buildings and I remember a nice fourth birthday party that was being thrown for me.  I remember the cake with the white icing on it.  I remember the number four with the flame on top.  It was a pink and white four, and I remember everyone being very happy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember also you know normally you reserve, you reserve--my name was on the cake and everything.  And normally you reserve the piece that has your name on it for the birthday boy or birthday girl.  And that's normally a larger piece.  So I remember a friend of mine, Jimmy Fedagadi [ph.], he got a smaller piece and he spent what seems like hours when you're a kid, but it must have been at least several seconds or several minutes, trying to negotiate with me, trying to, try to make me give him the larger piece and he would trade for giving me the smaller piece.  I eventually said no, but I remember that also.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It was still a good time.
Speaker 1: Now so you, you grew up in Bethesda now did you grow up the whole time in, in Bethesda?
Speaker 2: No, Bethesda up until I was in second grade, then in second grade that's when I moved to--that's when we all moved to Wheaton, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay then to Wheaton, okay.  You were born in Silver Spring [Maryland] basically in a hospital in Silver Spring?
Speaker 2: Right, Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So you grew up in Wheaton which is not that far away from Silver Spring, I mean it's in the same--
Speaker 2: Yeah they're right next to each other, yeah.  Are you familiar with the area?
Speaker 1: Yeah we spent a lot of time there one year doing interviews.
Speaker 2: Yeah I bet a lot of your interviewees are there too, yeah.  Working for the government and outside the government.
Speaker 1: So Wheaton, Maryland, so you all had, had a house.  Your family had a home in Wheaton.
Speaker 2: Right we moved from an apartment to a house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23160
Speaker 1: Now okay, well can you describe where you grew up and, and some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Where I grew up and the sights, sounds and smells.  First thing I remember of course is the pool.  We had a pool in the backyard I loved, and I loved that because I loved swimming.  Really took up, really took up swimming at an early age and almost naturally.  Not that my parents threw me in the water, but I had no problem going into the deep end.  But anyway that's one of the things I Remember about the pool when we lived in the apartment and when we moved to a house.  I remember the pool, nice front yard, nice back yard and we lived near a park also, Wheaton Regional Park [Wheaton, Maryland].  And that had of course jungle gyms and all sort of things you could play on.  But right next to Wheaton Regional Park or part of it was also a beautiful lake called Pine Lake.  And we'd go fishing there and just go there to relax or just ride your bike or walk or jog or just be alone with your thoughts.  Those are some of the things I remember.  Also we lived--in Wheaton Regional Park there was an ice rink too.  So in the winter time I remember ice skating.  This goes back to why--I mean any time of year is fine with me, I enjoy all the seasons.  With every season or any time of year growing up especially in the house where I grew up in, in the house or around the house and outside of our property, there was always something to do and being a kid a lot of things related to playing outdoors.  Places to ride your bike, places to run, places to play basketball, football, baseball, places to go fishing.  In the winter time places to go ice skating.  So every time I talk to kids when I--I mean I'm really big on--my mom and dad gave me this piece of advice, and I know we might cover this later how I got into meteorology.  That's one of the questions I immediately get from kids when I talk to them is why did you become a weatherman or why did you become a meteorologist?  And I say well my mom and dad always told me well whatever it is you want to be, we don't care, just make sure you choose something that you love.  And so that always stuck with me and I thought about what I loved.  Well my first love was football and I can see the smile growing on your face.  Obviously I'm not a football player.  The only--the highest place I got was second string linebacker in high school and then that was it.  So when I realized pro football obviously wasn't going to work out, I thought of other things that I loved, and that's when I thought back to my childhood and it always came to a few things dealing with weather.  I loved when it snowed because growing up in Maryland, one inch of snow and they closed the schools down right away.  President [Barack] Obama jokes about that a little bit, but I loved it when it snowed because I loved snow days.  And when I was in school, I loved math and science.  So weather, math and science put together is what meteorology is about.  But those sights and sounds of home I think really fed, fed into my love of weather and love of meteorology.
Story_ID: 23161
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah I remember being in [Washington] DC in '78 [1978] when the schools closed because of a--what I thought was a little dusting.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Having come from Chicago [Illinois], you know, I couldn't believe they shut the schools down.
Speaker 2: Right, that's exactly what the President [Barack Obama] said because he's familiar with Chicago too.
Speaker 1: Right, but, but Mary--that part of Maryland is, is, is a beautiful part of the country.  Being outdoors so did you spend a lot of time like watching the sky and the elements when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: I remember growing up spending a lot of time outdoors and really having--well obviously spending a lot of time outdoors not only in my neighborhood, but I remember--I was born and raised in the public school system from elementary school all the way through high school.  And I remember our public school system was absolutely fantastic.  Not only did I get a good education inside school, but also outside school where they would plan field trips.  Not just around Silver Spring [Maryland] or Wheaton [Maryland], but field trips into Washington, DC and going to the National Zoo, going to the Museum of Natural History, going to other sites and other areas around DC, Maryland and Virginia [referred to, collectively, as the DMV] that really you know, fed into me wow, this is what--I mean this is basically what the environment is like and these are some of the opportunities that one can have.  That's what I realized later as, as I got older and as I started to reflect more.  And of course a lot of that--when I say reflecting more, a lot of that of course is by--is almost by force because eventually get older, you finish up high school and eventually you know you have to be on your own.  One because you want to be, two because your parents want you to be because they want you out of the house eventually.  They still love, but they know that you have to eventually spread your own wings and fly.  Go to college, establish a good career and then build a life of your own.  So when I realized that that part of my life was starting to come to fruition, that's when I started reflecting more.
Story_ID: 23162
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now as--you said you like football.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you grew up I guess in the age when the Redskins won a lot of games.  They were like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know they had one a--
Speaker 1: A Super Bowl and--
Speaker 2: Yeah they won a Super Bowl in 1974 and everything and of course there's always been the Redskins/Dallas Cowboys rivalry.  So I grew up with that a lot.
Speaker 1: Didn't they win some in the--yeah in--
Speaker 2: In '74 [1974] they won and then the '80's [1980's] with Doug Williams.
Speaker 1: Williams, right.
Speaker 2: Doug Williams, they won one against Miami.  For whatever reason I was never an avid Redskins fan.  I was more--I loved the Miami Dolphins, actually.  I think it was for two reasons:  One I had a best friend named Michael McMann, this was in elementary school when we were already moved to the house and I was going to Arcola Elementary.  I befriended a young, a, a, fellow student named Michael McMann, haven't talked to him--ever since elementary school.  But he moved down to Florida shortly after second or third grade.  But I remember him being my best friend and finding out okay, he was moving down to south Florida and where exactly.  And he moved down to Plantation, Florida.  But I just remember that and I just combined it with my love of football and I just said well I love the Miami Dolphins.  A second reason was when I, I used to get these little books.  McDonald's had this promotion back then where they--it was during Super Bowl time, you get a little booklet of all the Super Bowls up to, up to whatever that current year was.  And I remember getting each one of those booklets because I loved football so much.  And I remember looking at the records, my mom and dad--my dad was a math and science teacher so my mom an information scientist so that's why I, I love numbers.  So I was looking at the records of all the teams at the time and I noticed that the Miami Dolphins went 17 and 0, they had the perfect record.  And I thought that was absolutely outstanding.  So that's another reason why I love the Miami Dolphins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23163
Speaker 1: Now what, what else did you like to do?  Now you're a, a, an only child at home.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the household consisted of your parents and you.  So did you have a lot of friends around or did they, did they come, come over to your house or--
Speaker 2: Yeah I get that question also.  You're an only child, weren't you lonely a lot or something like that.  And really I never felt--I really never felt alone and I never felt lonely.  I always had friends around.  Again, we were one of the few houses that had a pool in the backyard, so that's another reason why we were one of the most popular houses on the block probably and why a lot of friends wanted to come over.  So I always had a lot of friends that were around, whether they would come to my house to go swimming or I would go to their house and we'd go out bike riding or something like that, or they'd have a video game console and we'd play video games or something.  But yeah because of all that, I just never really felt alone, never felt lonely.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 23164
Speaker 1: So well tell me about school.  Now where, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Let's see, first went to Fernwood Elementary, then when we moved to Arcola Elementary, and then E. Brook--what?
Speaker 1: Arcola, A-R-C-O-L-A?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Fernwood Elementary [School] first, that was in Bethesda [Maryland], F-E-R-N-W-O-O-D.  And then that school closed down and we moved anyway.  So I went to Arcola Elementary, that's A-R-C-O-L-A.  Went there through sixth grade, then went to middle school for seventh and eighth grade and that was Colonel E. Brook Lee Junior High School.  And then went to John F. Kennedy High School in Silver Spring [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay, and John, JFK High School in Silver Spring, okay all right now, now did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah generally I liked school.  I tell students all the time math and science were my favorite subjects.  But yeah I generally liked school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay did you have any, were there any special teachers in school?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I remember Ms. Harris from first grade, she was really nice.  Ms. Lepine [ph.], when we moved--what time do you have, 10:20? [OFF-CAMERA VOICE]
Speaker 1: 10:16.  I remember--I'll start over again.  Teachers that I liked.  I remember in first grade Ms. Harris, she was really nice.  Then from--in second grade, that's when we moved.  It was not in the middle of the school year, it was during the summer.  So brand new school year, brand new school, there was a bit of an adjustment for me.  I remember crying nearly every single day, every single time I went to school for the first time during, during second grade.  But I remember a Ms. Lepine, L-E-P-I-N-E.  Ms. Lepine of second grade, she was really sweet, really nice.  She was one of the older teachers, but she really knew how to handle me just right and make me feel more comfortable, get me to stop crying, make my parents feel comfortable in leaving me while I was crying, and really took care of me very nicely; so eventually got over that.  Ms. Gantz, she was terrific.  It's interesting, when I--my first job was in Washington, DC and Ms. Gantz was still teaching at the time, G-A-N-T-Z.  Ms. Gantz was my third grade teacher and it's interesting because she would because she was still teaching at the time when I got my first job in Washington, DC and this was on air, Channel Four in DC.  And so I actually went back to the school she was teaching at, at the time, it wasn't Arcola any more, it was a different one.  But spoke to her class.  So it was interesting how all that came full circle.  A little bit later on Ms. Hester, H-E-S-T-R, H-E-S-T-E-R.  She was an African American female teacher.  She was a terrific woman.  Again, Ms. Hester was my fifth grade teacher and she was absolutely terrific.  Let's see in sixth grade Ms. England.  She eventually went on, I remember she went--after she taught me in sixth grade a few years afterward, she, she eventually I think became part of the administration of Montgomery County public schools, maybe becoming Assistant Principal and Principal of a school, of a school in that county and maybe moving on somewhere else in the, in the administration.  But I remember she being a solid teacher.  She was stern, but she was solid.
Story_ID: 23165
Speaker 1: Okay so your, your favorite subjects were math and science?
Speaker 2: Yeah math and science I think were my favorite subjects.  I always gravitated towards those.  I just enjoyed numbers, formulas, calculating and always did well.
Speaker 1: Now did you, did you--now you spent time outdoors, I know you liked sports, but did you spend time like really analyzing television and radio in terms of what goes on there?
Speaker 2: In terms of--I remember with math just I'll get to that answer in a second.  I also remember with math I also loved the challenge of math.  Even when I might have had some difficulties, always the challenge of still trying to get the answer right, that's something that still motivated me too.  Now in terms of television while growing up and whether I paid any special attention, this maybe goes back to snow days.  I do remember paying particular attention to the weather and listening to what the meteorologists were saying, and also what the meteorologists was showing.  And sometimes I wouldn't even hear what they were saying, I would see the temperatures on the map, I would see the satellite and radar pictures that they were showing and saw whether or not things were converging to give us either rain, sleet or snow or hey maybe all three.  And trying to figure out whether or not we would actually have a snow day.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so you--as a problem almost, as math problem, as you liked math problems you liked--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --trying to figure out--
Speaker 2: Right, almost as my own little forecasting challenge in my head at least, yeah.  Almost like a math or science problem, yeah.  Doing my own little prediction or see if, seeing how well I could predict along with the meteorologists that I saw on television.
Speaker 1: Okay so I guess your television station in Washington, DC would--it had a large area they covered first of all, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What's going on in Wheaton [Maryland] may, may not be what's going on in DC proper.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  The sta--the DMA or market size Washington, DC, it includes Washington, DC, much of Maryland including central and northern, central Maryland, part of southern Maryland, part of north central Maryland.  Northern Virginia and the eastern panhandle of West Virginia, so it is quite a wide area and that stretches from the Appalachians [mountains] all the way down to the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River.  So yeah you're covering a wide area there and a wide area of geography.  And all that geography and varying, varying temperatures has a huge impact on what the weather may be.
Story_ID: 23166
Speaker 1: So now in--at JFK High School, did you have--by the time you got to high school, did you have--who were your heroes, who were your--who were the people you looked up to the most in terms of personal people, people that you knew personally and what you knew publicly, publicly, profile.
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I think at the time I was just--I remember of course admiring my mom and dad.  In terms of other folks, I still loved football at the time, still thought I was going to be a pro football player so maybe paid attention to different professional football players.  But that was probably up to the first couple of years of high school.  Then all the other guys got bigger and stronger than I, I was so I realized okay, I got to change course here a little bit.  But let's see.  Other than that, I mean I had some teachers that I liked, like Arthur Besher, Mr. Besher, he was a, he was a good history teacher.  And outside of that in terms of--okay publicly the people that I paid attention to or maybe admired were different football players like Walter Payton, Earl Campbell, even players from the past like Dick Butkus.  And entertainers, in particular Prince, I was a big Prince fan.  I mean I grew up, I grew up listening to all kinds of music from rock and roll to R&B [rhythm and blues], and rap was coming up at the time so getting more into that.  So those are probably the three main forms of music that I listened to.  But I remember early on took a liking to, to Prince the most.  So in terms of national or internationally known figures, that's one of the people that I admired and still to this day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Prince starts making his I guess impact in the late '80's [1980's] I guess or early, yeah late '80's [1980's].
Speaker 2: Yeah I think I first heard him when he had the 1999 album and then of course he had the movie Purple Rain and those were in the early '80's [1980's].  And I think admired him the most be--I think I admired him a lot, not mainly because I wanted to become a musician, but the few interviews that he did at the time I either read them or listened to them.  I basically enjoyed, I, I admired his work ethic and his general disposition and the concept again that goes back to what my mom [Susanne Humphrey] and dad [Andrew Clifton Humphrey] said, you can really tell that Prince actually loves what he's doing.  So really having a passion for, for something that you want to do and really diving into it with both feet, that's something that I admire.  And a sense of integrity.  Once you dive into something trying to be as true as possible to it and trying to help others.  The artists that I admire nowadays whether it's Prince or anybody else who really seem to take a key interest in sharing their stories.  Not only through interviews, but mainly through the art form that they're dealing with.  So you can understand them a little bit better and it gives you also maybe a better understanding of yourself.  It's sort of a, it's sort of--I see it as a form of service or a form of helping, which is something I try to carry with me in what I do.  What I also tell kids when they ask why I wanted to become a meteorologist, not only because I love weather, math and science, but also because I love helping people.  And when I do the weather every single day, whether the weather is good or bad, I'm helping moms, dads, kids, families just simply get ready for the day.  Anything as simple as what to wear before going outside, whether they need a hat or a jacket or short sleeves, or whether it's even appropriate to go outside.  Maybe it's safer to be inside, especially if there's a weather emergency, if there's a thunderstorm or tornado or a blizzard or a hurricane.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23167
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was asking you about some of your heroes growing up and I did--it just occurred to me that when, when you were growing up, it was the first time for like a black presence on network television, Max Robinson on ABC news and others started to, you know follow in the '70's [1970's] or early '80's [1980's].  Did you, did you think--well growing up with that, did you even think, think it was special?
Speaker 2: Well you know what?  In terms--I didn't--growing up as a child, elementary school age, middle school age, maybe even high school age, never paid attention to national news very much.  I did watch local news and I remember Jim Vance, he's one of the local news stars who still anchors to this day at WRC, Channel Four in Washington, DC.  So I remember growing up watching him when, when he was anchoring the news.  I also remember on the other stations there was Maureen Bunyan who is a news anchor at then Channel Nine, WUSA.  And of course seeing African American reporters on those stations as well.  So yes, as I, as I was growing up and certainly when I got older, I, I understood the significance of having the first African Americans on television presenting the news, weather or sports, whether it was locally or nationally.  By the time that I was growing up, let's see, since it was on regularly, I just simply took it as a part of live, you know.
Speaker 1: And Washington, DC, the DC area has so many black personalities on television locally that I guess it may--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You, you could take that for granted.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  In fact I was not the first, but I got my first, I got my first job in Washington, DC at WRC doing the weather regularly.  I was not the first black male to do weather in DC.  I wish I could remember his name.  When I did an interview at Channel 32, which is WHUT, the Howard University [Washington, D.C] Television Station, I mentioned his name.  I remembered it at the time.  I wish I could remember it now, but I can't.  But I, I remember the--sometime in the, in the '70's [1970's], there was another African American man who did weather on TV.  I wish I could remember his name but I can't right now.
Story_ID: 23168
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did--so when you were in high school, did you have a vocation in mind?
Speaker 2: A vocation?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: I mean what did you aspire to be when you finished college, you know.
Speaker 2: My first love was football, so I wanted to be a football--my first love was football, so I wanted to be a pro football player.  And I didn't think about anything else really until, really until the end of high school.  Just before the end of high school when I got beat up on the football field enough times and got hit in the head a lot and got pushed backward instead of pushing the other guy backward.  So that's when I started seriously thinking about other things.  And the thing that got my mind going about that was simply had to do with really it was in preparation for the PSAT [Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test] and the SATs [Scholastic Aptitude Test] because they had the question on there what do you want to major in and there was no, nothing there for pro football, so that's when I really started thinking huh, let me look at this list of majors and simply go down it and check off what interests me and whatever doesn't interest me, just don't check it.  And meteorology was one of those things that I checked.  Now I loved math and science.  I knew that, so also check marked mathematics, some of the science disciplines, especially physics and engineering, some social sciences, not too much in the way of history but some things like psychology and sociology because I had heard of them but didn't know too much about them so I was intrigued at least.  But that's when I started thinking about other things that I could be once I became an adult.  And then it wasn't really until--and that's, that's generally been my mode when it comes to making different life decisions.  Basically thinking broadly and then focusing in on one or at least a few things and then going with that.  Because once you focus in on that one thing you open that door, and that just opens up a whole new world of options for you that you can narrow down once again.  So that's essentially--that's sort of the thinking process or decision making process that I went through when it came to okay, figuring out what it is I wanted to do when I grew up.
Story_ID: 23169
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now you're in high school in the late '80's [1980's] right, you're there from '84 [1984] to '88 [1988] I guess.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Guessing here, but I'm pretty much--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so did you--I know Jesse Jackson ran for president in '84 [1984].  Is that, that something that was discussed at home, or--
Speaker 2: Let's see.  It wasn't discussed regularly at home.  I mean it was--I remember it being, I remember paying attention to it more because it was the first African--well let's see.  The most widely covered African American running for President at the time.  There were other African Americans who ran for PRseident before, but I think Jesse Jackson was probably the most famous at the time, or most widely covered.
Speaker 1: You're right cause we got Shirley Chisholm, may have been some others.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: That, but they, they didn't get the kind of--
Speaker 2: Right.  So I do remember that being important.  And I think I do remember Jesse Jackson being on the cover of 'Time Magazine'.  So those are things that were--they were probably, probably discussed at the time.  I don't remember anything specifically.  But as I mentioned before in our earlier part of the conversation, my father [Andrew Clifton Humphrey] was, my father was never one to be shy at speaking out about something or, or speaking his mind basically.  Not only with coworkers or his bosses, but even to his friends and things like that.  So sometimes when either he'd be together with his friends or I'd hear him on the phone, many times those conversations would turn to politics.  Sometimes he and I would have political discussions, but not as often as I, as the ones I overheard with, with many of his peers.  Yeah so that's, yeah so that's, that's what I remember most.
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to assemble the atmosphere when you were in high school and I think the--towards the end of high school is when the crack epidemic hit [Washington] DC.
Speaker 2: Yeah with Len Bias especially.  Len Bias especially was the most noted figure who passed away from a drug overdose, and that was in the mid '80's [1980's], 1986 if I'm not, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Yeah he was a star at the University of Maryland.
Speaker 2: Yeah University of Maryland.  And so that had a huge impact, not only on the local community, but it had an impact nationwide because that's when a lot of the drug laws were changed.  And that's where you had the disparity between punishment for crack versus powder cocaine.  But yeah all, those, of those serious issues, political issues, issues dealing with crime and race, those were some of the ones that were most noted when I was, when I was growing up at the time.  I think it reinforced--with me I think it, personally I think it reinforced a lot of--some of things that I was already thinking when it came to basically being a, a good person or being a good citizen growing up.  Making sure you're nice to others when it came to, when it came to drugs and alcohol, staying away from drugs certainly.  And either--staying away from alcohol if you were too young and as you got older, being, being careful with it.  And I think a lot of that's--a lot of that stems from how I was raised, not only by my mom and dad.  But I just remember, I remember growing up--the general fairly tales that we all listen to as a child, whether it's 'Snow White' or, or 'Sleeping Beauty', or stories like that.  A lot of those fairy tales had basic moral values attached to them.  And I, being a kid I didn't know any better, but I basically took a lot of that stuff to heart.  Same thing with what I was being taught in school.  Eventually I mean eventually when I--through elementary school, middle school and high school, when it came to American history and social sciences in general, the Civil Rights period [1955-1968] would always be covered, of course.  And Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Civil Rights Movement and everything that that stood, that, that that stood for.  And I took a lot of that to heart also.
Speaker 1: So now the schools that you attended were mostly integrated schools, mostly white schools, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  They were mostly white schools.
Speaker 1: In Montgomery County.
Speaker 2: Right, mostly whites, blacks, African Americans were the minority in school.  But I think both from being raised by my mom and dad and a lot of the lessons that I was taught in school, I remember being conscious of race and/or racism, but really not feeling, not really feeling hampered by race or racism, and not feeling that I was unequal to anyone else or couldn't do anything that anyone else wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was church a factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: Not very much.  My mother of course, my mother again is Jewish, my father comes from a Christian background being raised by a Baptist preacher.  But no, never really had any consistent religious training or religious influences in my life.  Never attended church regularly and never attended temple or synagogue regularly.
Speaker 1: So would you, you say that the moral compass that you have comes from your parents' teachings exclusively?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think my moral compass comes mainly from--it still comes from God because I was still aware that, that there were--that there was Christianity, there was Judaism, and they both believe in one God.  So I was--I understood the concept of God and I believed in God and I still do to this day.  In addition to that from my parents' teaching and from what I was taught in school, I think that shaped a lot of my mentality at the time and still has--is basically the foundation that I have today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your parents or the people you were around have an opinion about Marion Berry?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Well my dad, my dad was a supporter of Marion Berry and felt that he was unfairly targeted because he was black.  He felt that Marion Berry did a lot of good things for the city.  His stint as mayor was, in his opinion was exceptional. I don't think, I don't think my mother differed too much.  I mean they both knew that him doing, him doing drugs, him doing crack was obviously bad and something that was wrong and something that was very unfortunate.  But I think my, my father certainly a lot more than my mother, but still my mother also, they both recognized the good that he did for Washington, DC.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now--
Speaker 2: And good, and basically what he represented simply as an African American politician, especially at that time.
Speaker 1: I know in DC you can get a lot of different takes about Marion Berry so he's a subject that people can talk about endlessly.
Speaker 2: You know what?  Almost any large, almost large city in the United States that had its first black mayor at the time, whether it's Chicago and Harold Washington, whether it's here in Detroit and Coleman Young, or whether it's in DC and Marion Berry, I think you always get a lot of discussion, yeah.
Story_ID: 23170
Speaker 1: And now when you were on the verge of graduating, a big social event, especially for football fans.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And as the Super Bowl win with Doug Williams, black people all over the country paid attention to that.
Speaker 2: Yeah again, I always, I always think of my dad because my dad was more outspoken about it than my mom was.  But my--and they both were aware, my dad more keenly than anyone else, and certainly more outspoken about it than anyone else.  He paid attention to the trials and tribulations that Marion Berry was going through and even the, the trials and tribulations that Doug Williams, being the, I think the first black quarterback of the Washington Redskins, and if I'm not mistaken, the first black quarterback to win a Super Bowl and be MVP [Most Valuable Player] at the time.  And I do remember him, not only being outspoken about politics, but also being outspoken about athletics, and in particular Doug Williams.  I think this stems of course from him being, my father being involved with that--athletics on the coaching side.  But I remember he would write letters to Coach Joe Gibbs at the time when he felt that Doug Williams was not--either not getting the right play calls or not getting his due, or not getting enough play time while he was on, while he was on the field or during his career with the Redskins.  I do remember that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was a dramatic Super Bowl Victory.  This is, this would have been in February, or January--
Speaker 2: 1987 if I'm not, '87 [1987] or '88 [1988] if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Yeah it had just flipped to '88 [1988], it was the '87 [1987] season, but the Super Bowl was played in '88 [1988].
Speaker 2: Okay that's right.  And was it played in Pasadena [California]?  It was either Pasadena or Miami [Florida].  No, it was against Miami and I think it was in Pasadena if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: No, it was against Denver [Colorado], Denver Broncos with John Elway.
Speaker 2: It was Denver, okay that's right, okay.
Speaker 1: John Elway and they went out to a lead, a twenty point lead in the first quarter.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, yeah that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Doug Williams had to limp off the field and then he comes back and throws five touchdown passes or something like that.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Which is, is--you couldn't have anymore drama.  So everybody was, you know now I actually as in [Washington] DC in '88 [1988], just saw the delirium.  You know, people were still selling t-shirts in March about the Super Bowl.
Speaker 2: Yeah I remember my dad and I actually went down to the parade, the celebration and the parade that happened in downtown DC when they came back for their homecoming.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that was a big football deal in DC.
Story_ID: 23171
Speaker 1: But so, so you're on the college prep track, you know you're going to college.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How are your grades now, are you one of the top students or you just doing okay, or--
Speaker 2: They were better than average.  I mean I was getting As and Bs.  I wish I was getting straight As, but I was getting As and Bs at the time.  And yeah, looking forward to going to college and this speeds into my making decisions--thinking, starting off with a broad base and then narrowing a focus.  My mom and dad really didn't put any restrictions on me in terms of what level of college--that is going to, applying to top ten schools versus schools that were rated maybe a little bit lower.  Or geography, applying basically to anywhere in the country.  Or the number of schools cause you know you had to pay a fee for the applications and some folks see that as maybe a barrier.  But I applied to I think maybe fifteen or twenty schools at the time because I wanted a wide variety to basically to choose from cause I was still undecided exactly what I wanted to do.  Again yes I ticked off meteorology as an interest.  But I still had other interests, some with math and science and engineering, some without math, science and engineering.  But that's why I wanted to have a broad array to choose from once the decision time actually came.
Speaker 1: Okay at the time that you checked off meteorologist, did you have a sense of what a meteorologist is?  I mean we hear them on television, they introduce--this is, he's a meteorologist.  And I, you know I sit back, I kind of suspect that this guy [unclear] did they promote him or something, just made him do--I mean does he, did he really go to school and learn something special?  I think a lot of people don't really know what a meteorologist is.
Speaker 2: Well you know growing up in [Washington] DC there was a meteorologist on TV named Bob Ryan.  And he was actually instrumental in me getting my first job.  Bob Ryan worked at--first in, in Boston at the NBC station there, then he was on the 'Today Show' for a little bit.  But when I got to know him in Washington, he was working at Channel Four as the local meteorologist in Washington, DC.  And I noticed his job title cause his job title was Chief Meteorologist.  Being somewhat smart I realized okay, meteorologist is someone that studies meteorology.  So once I actually saw the word meteorology as I got older, I had a good understanding of what it actually meant because I understood seeing Bob on TV being the meteorologist, a meteorologist is someone that studies weather, and that's what meteorology is all about.
Speaker 1: Okay so you did have a sense of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah when I saw meteorology, when I saw the term meteorology as a subject one could major in, that's when I realized okay, yeah that's about studying weather.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right but at that--the time that you're applying to school that's one of a few things that you're thinking about, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah it's one of the few things.  And the other thing again, Bob was a meteorologist and he'd always throw in little science facts, so that's how I got the sense.  Not only by the sound and the sound and spelling of the name either meteorologist or meteorology, that there's math and science involved, but also throwing out those tidbits dealing with science or, or technology or mathematics, yes there is math and science involved in the subject of meteorology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now were you involved in any clubs or were you--did you run for class office or anything like that in high school?
Speaker 2: In high school?  No I didn't do anything like that, it was mainly let's see, football, there was swimming, I still love swimming.  I was on the swim team my last two years.  Anything else?  That was basically it.  I think I joined the Astronomy Club because [John F.] Kennedy High School [Silver Spring, Maryland] had a little planetarium or a telescope on the top of the school.  But that was only like for one year.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But no, I never got into school politics, never ran for office.
Story_ID: 23172
Speaker 1: Now so you wound up choosing the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, and why did you--was it because of a suggestion that somebody had or, or just you just thought--
Speaker 2: It came down to a few things.  Football is still involved because I still had Bo Shembeckler [ph.] as a coach and a great football team, so that was still involved.  Not that I wanted to play football at [University of] Michigan cause I knew I'd never make it on the, on the field as a player.  But I knew I'd have, I'd have a good time in the stands if I eventually went to that school.  But also on the serious side of actually studying and eventually graduating with a degree, I noticed that their meteorology program they actually did have one, and one could get a Bachelor's in meteorology.  What stood out was, what was distinctive was the, the meteorology was in the Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Science Department and that is in the College of Engineering.  The College of Engineering at the University of Michigan is very prestigious.  It's on par with MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology], other centers of engineering at different colleges and universities around the country.  And I knew that was a very difficult place to get into.  I was fortunate and privileged to earn a spot there and realized that meteorology being in the College of Engineering, that's something that does not happen at other colleges and universities.  Most other places, the meteorology program is in the General Science School if you will.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Not on the engineering side of their campus.  So that gave me the opportunity to not just to get a, a BS in meteorology, a Bachelor of Science, but earn a BSE, a Bachelor of Science and Engineering in meteorology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And again when it came to widening options, it also gave me the options once I got accepted, to not only look at meteorology as a possible subject to major in, but any engineering discipline to major in.  So while I was at the college during the first couple of years, I would compare the meteorology program, or meteorology to other forms of engineering that were going on in the college, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, aerospace engineering because you know, jet planes looked cool and all that type of stuff. But I ended up choosing meteorology because it was still my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay so, so what was the, the course load like for meteorology?  I mean you had to take most of the basic engineering courses and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's see, first two years were getting your core courses down.  So that was the first time I took calculus.  I never had calculus in high school.  But anyway calc--all--my calc classes, you know up to Calculus Three then Differential, Differential Equations, your basic sciences down, especially physics and chemistry.  Those were for the first two years.  And then the final two years was when you got into your core subjects in, in meteorology or atmospheric science.  And those were different combinations of basically math--a lot of it was different combinations of math, physics and chemistry, especially when you got to thermodynamics, about how the atmosphere works and, and how to predict what's going to happen later on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a particular mentor, you know in meteorology at the University of Michigan?
Speaker 2: I had an advisor, his name was Dr. Drayson, D-R-A-Y-S-O-N.  He was an Australian in the United States for a long time, he's retired now.  But I remember he was my, he was my advisor during my years at the University of Michigan.  I wouldn't see him--I would see him--his door was always open, which was terrific.  And he, he provided good guidance when it came to okay laying out a game plan course-wise so I could get through my four years in four years.  In addition to that, the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan at, at the time, this was before Prop Two and the anti-affirmative action stuff that was going--that went on later.  They had the Multi-Cultural Engineering Program Office, or MEPO.  And that office was also instrumental.  They were the ones that actually first got me oriented onto campus because they had a program called PTP, which stood for Professionals in Training Program, which was a two week overnight stay during the summer before my freshman year.  And that's where I took some basically primer courses, not that I needed--I didn't need any remedial help, but understanding okay, this is how, this is college, you're going to be on your own.  This is the best way to manage your time.  When you get into your first calc class, these are some of the first equations or first things that you'll be learning.  When you get into your science classes, these are some of the things that you'll be learning.  And there were general what they called success skills that they also taught us.  And those were instrumental when it came to things like time management and understanding the lay of the land at the university to help us succeed.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now University--
Speaker 2: And if I may, Derrick Scott, he was the head of the MEPO Office.  He was the head--Derrick Scott, D-E-R-R-I-C-K, Scott, S-C-O-T-T, Derrick Scott, he was the head of MEPO and he still basically head of Academic Affairs essentially, at the College of Engineering at Michigan today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was a great mentor too, in addition to my advisor in my department.
Speaker 1: Now what does MEPO stand for again?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Multi-Cultural Engineering Program Office.
Speaker 1: MEPO, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, M-E-P-O.
Speaker 1: Okay I got it.
Speaker 2: Multi-cultural Engineering Program Office.  I forget what they call it now; was just up there for Homecoming two weekends ago, I don't remember what it's called now.  But it's got a different name because of Prop Two.
Story_ID: 23173
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Proposition Two, this is the--
Speaker 2: Prop Two is the anti-affirmative action legislation that was voted in for the state of Michigan.  So schools that are--public universities, schools that receive public funding cannot base their decisions or develop programs based on race.
Speaker 1: Yeah that was based on--the catalyst was a lawsuit by Allen Bacci back in the '70's [1970's] I believe.
Speaker 2: Maybe, I don't--the University of Michigan case itself, I don't remember.  I remember all--for some reason when the case went to--cause I remember the case going to the Supreme Court.  What I remember was also mixed in there was someone who did not get into the University of Michigan Law School.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's Allen Bacci.
Speaker 2: Okay that was it, okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah that started, started it up.  Yeah it started in the mid '70's [1970's]--
Speaker 2: Well the Supreme Court didn't hear it until the, wasn't it maybe the late '90's [1990's] or around 2000?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Cause I think I remember Prop Two coming in the early 2000's.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  I know busloads of people from Detroit [Michigan], NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] sponsored buses to go to the--to Ann Arbor [Michigan] to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or to Lansing I think for the decision of the, you know--no they went to [Washington] DC, that's right.  They went to DC to, to--
Speaker 2: They may have gone down to DC because the Supreme Court I think heard the University of Michigan case.
Speaker 1: Right, they went all the way down to DC.  A friend of mine filmed it.
Speaker 2: Really?  Wow.  Is that part of The HistoryMaker's archive too?
Speaker 1: No, no it's not.
Speaker 2: Something separate.
Speaker 1: Something separate, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 23174
Speaker 1: In Detroit.  I remember that, 2003 I guess, 2002 or 2003.  Yeah okay.  So Derrick Scott was the head of the MEPO [Multicultural Engineering Programming Office] Office and so okay.
Speaker 2: And Matt, and off time for this will be 11:45, that's when I need to go downstairs.  Just letting you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So we still have a good chunk of time.
Speaker 1: Okay now so were the--so the MEPO Office was, was that basically the, the galvanizing force for African American engineering students?
Speaker 2: It was one of them.  I mean it was a really good guiding force.  I mean they had tutors if you needed help or just--they had tutors if you needed help with any courses or anything like that.  They also provided space, you know study halls, things of that, things like that in addition to the library.  But they were also I think they were very instrumental as a, as a guiding force because at the time there was the--we had student groups based on engineering.  I mean you have SWE, the Society of Women Engineers, but for African Americans, Hispanics or Latinos and Native Americans, the underrepresented minorities in the field of engineering, you had the Society of Minority Engineering Students, NSBE, which is a national organization, National Society of Black Engineers.  We had a student chapter on campus.  And MEPO sort of had a, an indirect involvement just by letting us--more for informational purposes.  We as students once we're there on campus, not only do we have to be in class but once we're outside of class, not only are we doing, not only are we doing our regular social things, whether it's parties, whether it's sports activities that we go to.  But still things dealing with engineering, still in a social setting.  These are things that they made us as students aware of to help guide us through the College of Engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So now what--so you're a--
Speaker 2: Not only, I'm sorry, not only did they give us a, a good, a good--the great activity of guidance if we needed help as students, but even us as mentors.  If our, some of our fellow students had problems with something in math class or one of our science or other engineering courses, some of us also volunteered as mentors, whether it was being a sophomore, junior or a senior to help out other, other folks who were either in our same grade level, or who were in grade levels before us who were freshman or sophomores or other younger ones, if they needed help also.  So that helped too.
Speaker 1: I would imagine, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you would have been, you know pretty much up to speed when you got to the University of Michigan cause you, you're not coming from an inner city school with education issues and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah I came from--well I had a, in my opinion I had a very solid background at home.  I mean I--two parents of course who loved me and helped guide me through there.  Grew up with a dynamite public education also from elementary school all the way through high school.  Sure a lot of my peers were in advanced math and already had calculus by the end of high school, but in general Calc One is taught to a lot of students in first year at college.  But the upbringing that I had, both in school and outside of school, made me aware of what college would be like for my first year.  And I really have to give credit to my parents, my--the public education that I went through, and the University of Michigan for all their pre-freshman programs that I was introduced to.
Speaker 1: Yeah and your father was in math and science.
Speaker 2: Yeah that too.  I mean again, my mom was an Information Scientist, National Library of Medicine.  My father was a math and science teacher in the public school system, both [Washington] DC and Montgomery County [Maryland].  So all that leaned to some of the--a lot of the advantage--well a lot of the--I'm a humble person so I, well I'm modest let's say.  All that fed into the success that I had when I got to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23175
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so we were just talking about your preparation and you were, you know the coursework wasn't hard, really difficult for you.
Speaker 2: It was still challenging but I got, I got through it and got my degree, and got it in four years.
Speaker 1: Okay now were there any other activities at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] we need to talk about before we move beyond to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Well I mean, let's see, well I think I did--I think I--I had a very--I had fun during college.  I loved my college years.  Other things I got into, besides going to the football games, that was a lot of fun, Black Student Union I got involved with, also the Society of Minority Engineering Students, the student chapter of NSBE, National Society of Black Engineers.  Those are some of the things off the top of my head that I remember getting involved in.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to meet black engineers from around the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where I met, first met Charlie Bolden.  Also at MEPO was a, was a woman named Anne Monterio, Anne with an E at the end, Monterio, M-O-N-T-E-R-I-O.  Anne Monterio, she was also an administrator with, with MEPO and with Academic Affairs at the University of Michigan's College of Engineering.  She worked a lot with the athletes, especially a lot of those athletes who were interested in engineering, and all things dealing with underrepresented minorities, she happened to be African American, as was Derrick Scott who I mentioned earlier.  But she knew a lot of other professional black scientists, engineers, technologists and mathematicians and would bring them to the campus often to speak to us.  And that's where I first met Astronaut Charlie Bolden, Colonel Charlie Bolden who eventually headed up NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] now.
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: During the Obama-President [Barack] Obama's administration.  So I remember that, that was the first time I think I ever met an astronaut from what I recall.  So that's an example of some of the other professionals, that's an example of the professionals that I met, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay now do you remember the Challenger disaster [The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster occurred on January 28, 1986, when Space Shuttle Challenger (mission STS-51-L) broke apart seventy-three seconds into its flight, leading to the deaths of its seven crew members]?  You remember seeing that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I was in school, I was, I was in school at the time, this was before college and I remember being in school when I heard it.  I didn't see it when it went, when it was live.  This was at a time when--it was already at a time when shuttle launches were pretty much on a regular basis, so they wouldn't cancel classes and have everyone, everyone meet in one place.  But I remember first hearing about it and not, not believing it at first because they said the space shuttle, shuttle explode, exploded.  And my first vision was it exploded on the launch pad.  And I'd seen pictures or videos of that happening and I said I can't imagine that happening.  But then I Remember seeing it for the first time a little bit later that day, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think that's what happened to Robert Warren, he was involved in--the first black astronaut was involved in an explosion on the launch pad.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But okay.  So now you graduated from University of Michigan in 19--
Speaker 2: That was in '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992] and you had a, a BS in--
Speaker 2: That was a BSE in meteorology.  Yeah so I graduated in 1992, University of Michigan in meteorology, and that was a BSE, a Bachelor of Science and Engineering in meteorology.
Story_ID: 23176
Speaker 1: Okay so you went right to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], right?
Speaker 2: Right, I immediately went to graduate school, and for that I went to MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: It's a--nobody would wonder why you would go, but how did you get into MIT?  I mean it was--is there a story about how you chose MIT or how they chose you or--
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Well I guess there's a brief one.  Similar to my choosing of where to go for undergrad, my graduate--my decision on where to go to graduate school followed the same path.  I applied to various graduate schools across the country, from the west coast over to the east coast.  And also visited a lot of schools and for undergrad before going to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], I visited there first.  Same thing with Purdue and some other schools out herein the Midwest as well as some schools on the east coast.  So when it came to graduate school, I did the same--I followed the same pattern and I applied to MIT, Columbia, Princeton [University], University of Maryland, they have a good meteorology program also, and Johns Hopkins [University in Baltimore, Maryland].  And basically what I did was I drove up 95 north from [Washington] DC and visited Johns Hopkins, Columbia [University] and then MIT, this was even before I got accepted to any of those schools, to see what they actually looked like first hand and to speak to some of the advisors and professors there.  And I think that was actually instrumental in me being accepted to a lot of those schools.  Cause I got accepted to--cause I remember my choice came down to Columbia University and MIT.  Columbia University is right in the heart of New York City, basically on the island of Manhattan [New York].  And when I visited there, I was awestruck.  That's when I first fell in love with New York City [New York], basically.  And so I was in awe of that.  And then when I visited MIT, well I was in awe again, maybe Boston [Massachusetts] or Cambridge [Massachusetts] is not as big as New York City, but still everyone knows what MIT is and what it means to go to MIT.  And so that's one of the discussions that I remember having with my mom and dad.  My dad in particular, because he just said--I said Dad, I'm really caught up here.  I don't know whether to choose, say yes to Columbia or MIT.  And he just said the names out loud.  He started saying MIT more and more, MIT, MIT, MIT.  And then it eventually became a no brainer for him, of course you go to MIT, it's the number one school when it comes to--it's the number one school period, and it's the number one school when it comes to science, engineering and technology.  So that's, that's basically how I chose MIT.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so MIT, this was in 1992?
Speaker 2: Right, this was in '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: The Fall of '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now was--so what was the course of study like there and--
Speaker 2: That was more specialized.  Of course it was in--I got into graduate school and it was--in their EAPS Department, which is Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Science.  So I was studying for a graduate degree in, in meteorology.  I was still interested in meteorology.  And I just had to get a better idea of okay what kind of meteorology did I want to do.  I mean I'm doing broadcast meteorology now.  MIT its all--I mean it's, it's nerd central and I'm a nerd at heart, so it's all things dealing with math, science and weather.  So anything from synoptic meteorology or weather forecasting basically, climatology, tropical meteorology, and other types of meteorology.  And so I, I, I had one advisor--I had one advisor my first year, but then I switched to, to another one, Kerry Emanuel, that's K-E-R-R-Y, Emanuel, E-M-A-N-U-E-L.  And Kerry, or Dr. Emanuel, he was an expert when it came to studying hurricanes and when it came to weather forecasting.  And he was probably another, he was, he was an additional influence on my academic career and helping me attain, or helping me earn my Master's out of MIT.

Speaker 1: Okay now your thesis from what I have here was called "The Behavior of Total Mass of the Atmosphere".
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And that sounds like a lot.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: Total Mass of Atmosphere.
Speaker 2: It is.  Yeah it was basically going over the data that we had at the time about basically what the total mass of the atmosphere actually is and seeing how that changes over time.  Now mind you this thesis, thesis was written years ago, so I don't remember the results.  I do remember fluctuations.  But I couldn't, I couldn't--it's really hard for me to tell you what the actual conclusion of, of that thesis was; it was written so long ago.  But yeah that's what my thesis was on.
Speaker 1: So total mass of atmosphere.  Can you give us some idea of what you were actually looking at?
Speaker 2: Really the, the words speaks for itself.  It's literally the amount of stuff that makes up the atmosphere.  All the gases, oxygen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, water vapor, all of that, all that put together has a total mass all around the world.  And just seeing whether or not that changes over time.  And I noticed that it did change over time and I--that's what I wrote about.  I remember it, I remember it fluctuated.  I couldn't, I couldn't to this day though, tell you how much or if there's a general trend that it, that it's increasing or decreasing.  But I do remember seeing fluctuations.  Now it was not so specific as to okay the individual constituents of the atmosphere, seeing those--whether or not those increased or decreased over time, or how they varied over time.  It was just the total mass, period.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It also says for an outlet here that you specialized in atmospheric convection and the mechanisms acting to intensify hurricanes.
Speaker 2: And that was a lot--a lot of that was based off of what I learned in--what I learned during my classes and by me watching what Dr. Emanuel did.  Dr. Emanuel was one of the, is to this day one of the foremost authorities on hurricane development.  And so that I something that I had an interest in because I remember as a child seeing some pictures in some of the schoolbooks, general science schoolbooks and the chapters dealing with weather and seeing the devastation caused by hurricanes and tropical storms.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, did you enjoy the Cambridge [Massachusetts] area?
Speaker 2: Yeah I enjoyed the Cambridge area also.  I mean graduate school years were some of the best years of my life too.  But yeah I mean I enjoyed it because similar to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], you know it--let's see as I, I mean as I think about it what comes to my mind is people also ask me do you mind getting recognized when you're out in the general public.  And what I always say is you know what? When I was--when I went to high school we were all basically friendly to each other.  We had a, we had a moderate to large graduating class, maybe 13 or 1,400.  But we all reasonably got along and we knew each other's faces and said high to each other in the hallway, basically.  When I got to the University of Michigan, this is interesting too.  I went to the University of Michigan right after they had some real problems with racism.  In fact PBS did a Frontline story on racism on college campuses, it was called 'Racism 101' and the University of Michigan was one of those featured schools.  And I don't know if it was required or not, but that video was actually shown to us as pre-freshman before going to school.  And University of Michigan was figured prominently because they had incidents of African Americans being threatened and problems regarding the way African Americans were being treated on campus, how they recruited, if they were recruited at all; once they got there whether they were retained and actually graduated.  So there was a greater sense of awareness amongst African Americans and people who weren't African Americans, about racial issues that were on campus.  And I think that really served to galvanize all the African Americans on campus, whether you knew each other or not.  So even though the University of Michigan was a school, even then it was 35 to 40,000 undergraduate students.  Even if you were on the Diag [ph.], which is the main part of the central campus, the core of the central campus, even if you were on the Diag walking along it and there was another African American walking in the opposite direction and you didn't know them, you would still say hey or wave to them or nod your head to them as a, as a gesture of solidarity, respect or a greeting.
Speaker 1: Now MIT--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, but this all feeds back into MIT also.  I mean that's how I felt at MIT too.  Just like I got involved with the BSU [Black Student Union] at MIT or SMES, the Society of Minority Engineering Students, there was also the Black Graduate Student Union at the, at MIT.  I was actually an officer of that during one of my years there, during my second year at MI, at MIT.  But anyway that's how we all got to know, I got to know my fellow students very well.
Speaker 1: The Black Student Union at MIT is an established sort of institution there with an office and you can go--I've been to it.
Speaker 2: That's right and cause a lot of that stems from movement of the '60's [1960's] and '70's [1970's], the band movements, black action movements on the University of Michigan's campus during the Civil Rights period [1955-1968] and immediately afterward during the early and mid '70's [1970's].
Speaker 1: Yeah well [unclear] at the University of Michigan, but MIT's got a Black Student Union.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: There's that black sculpture that blocks the wind, we were just there like a week ago.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Any rate, but okay so, so that's, so--
Speaker 2: In addition to that.  When it come--this is one of the conversa--this one the part about, you know relating to my fellow students or being on campus, things like that.  I talked about involvement in so-called minority groups throughout most of this time.  Keep in mind I also got along very well with all the other students there too.  And just by nature of being in the same class and studying together and trying to get through those classes together, I--and this comes from my upbringing also and understanding that we're all equal.  I had no problem getting along with students who happened to be white, happened to be Hispanic, happened to be Asian or Native American, no matter what their background was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was good too.
Story_ID: 23179
Speaker 1: Now so you graduated from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] in 1995?
Speaker 2: That's right, in 1995, February of 1995.
Speaker 1: And now I don't have the year here, but--now when you graduated, did you, did you know you were going to do TV weather, was that the thing?
Speaker 2: No.  When I graduated, I didn't know exact--okay when I was coming upon graduation, I didn't know exactly what it is I wanted to do yet professionally.  Fortunately during my years of undergrad and graduate school, this was again a culmination of not only my upbringing, but also good guidance from the various professors and mentors that I had.  A good, good guidance and good priming for what the job field was like.  Cause I, I--the only experience that I had with meteorology or meteorologists was what I saw on television but I knew that there were other things.  So through my undergraduate years, that's when I got introduced to that, either by my professors, the folks in academic services, and so on.  So that's why I understood that there were meteorologists who worked with the National Weather Service that do predictions very day on the hour, or every few hours all around the country.  There are meteorologists who work at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], there are meteorologists in the private sector who aren't on television also.  And through that, through that process, I got a better sense of what the job field was actually like.  And that's when I also heard of these things called internships.  So the first internships that I had were during the summers when I would go back home to the [Washington] DC area.  There was an internship that I had at NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center.  There was a second internship that I had with the National Weather Service in Camp Springs, Maryland.  That's at their National Center for Environmental Prediction.  And a third internship that I had was at Channel 4 in Washington, DC, WRC.  And that's where Bob Ryan still was.  And the way that came about was this:  I guess my first two summers I just did regular stuff.  I think I life guarded at a couple of pools during my first two summers.  Well then I realized okay next summer I'm about to graduate with an undergraduate degree but I still don't know what the job field is like.  Now I know what internships are, I got to get me--I have to get an internship somewhere.  Well I'll have to find out what the job field is like somehow when it comes to meteorology.  So I presented this to my--I asked that to my, to my mom and dad and they said well we're not meteorologists, we don't know.  So why don't you go ahead and call some up?  So I said that's a good idea, so that's what I did.  And one of the meteorologists that I called was Bob Ryan at Channel Four in Washington, DC.  And he basically picked up the phone, we chatted for a little bit and he invited me to the TV station to see all the behind the scenes stuff that he works with and talk some more about what it's like to be a meteorologist on television.  So that's what I did.  A couple of days after I talked to him on the phone, I went down to the TV station.  He showed me the weather office, I got to see him actually go on air.  And at the end of our conversation, he said you know we have an internship program here, why don't you apply to it and see if you can work here next summer?  So that's what I did.  I earned that and I did that the following summer.  So that was my first taste of what broadcast meteorology was like.  And once I did that--this was by the end of my--this was right after my sophomore or junior year.  So once I completed that internship, I had my other two internships that I did.  In fact the one that I had at NASA was at the same time that I did my TV internship.  I would intern at NASA during the day and then head over to the TV station at night three or four times a week.  But once that was completed and I went back to school, I still stayed in touch not only with Bob, but all those other mentors or scientists or meteorologists that I worked with at NASA and with the National Weather Service.  So I would keep them updated on how I was doing in undergraduate school and that I was graduating from there and going on to graduate school.  Then by the time I finished graduate school at MIT I realized okay, now I would like to work.  So I let them know hey I'm graduating and they said--each one of them said hey, that's nice, here's some job opportunities.  And one of those happened to be at Channel Four where Bob worked at WRC.  And that internship that I had turned into my first job.
Story_ID: 23180
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now somewhere in the interim you attended the Motion Picture Institute of Michigan, right?
Speaker 2: That was actually afterwards, when I was already--that was when I first got back here to Detroit [Michigan] and southeast Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so we'll freeze that one.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And we'll go--but let me ask you this.  That summer when you interned with Bob Ryan, you got a chance to see for the first time what, what a television meteorologist does.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So what does a television meteorologist do?  We know what we see on television, but what do you--what, what's the preparation and what, what is your day like?
Speaker 2: Okay.  The preparation is--well for me, I can speak for myself.  What I do now being weekday morning and noon meteorologist here at Channel Four in Detroit.  Every single morning I get up between two and 2:30 in the morning, get here at the station between three and 3:30.  When I get here, I'm looking at all the weather information in my viewing area, at least in my viewing area that's happened the previous twenty-four hours before I got there.  So I can see okay, what type of weather is occurring now, what type of weather did occur immediately, and then I look at computer models to get a sense of what may happen in the future.  After looking at these various computer models, I get a sense of okay, this is what my weather forecast is going to be.  So I write down a description of okay, what type of weather is going on now, what type of weather is going to happen in the future, and that gives me a good base of what to actually talk about on television.  At the same time, if there's anything that's going on nationally or internationally like when we get into hurricane season like now, looking if there are any tropical storms or if there are any tropical storms or hurricanes or other, or other sort of tornado activity that might be headed in our direction.  I look at that also and see if that's going to affect us.  Or even if it's not going to affect us directly, our viewing audience no matter where it is, might have friends, relatives or some other interest in the area where that bad weather is happening.
Speaker 1: Okay.  For instance today we've got Hurricane Sandy [2012] I think.
Speaker 2: That's right, today we've got Hurricane Sandy, which has already moved over Jamaica, moving over eastern Cuba and headed over the Atlantic.  But there's a question of where it will go.  It will probably stay along the Carolina coastline, but everyone's concerned about whether it will turn to the west and hit either New York or New England.  And regardless of where it goes, it still has an indirect weather, indirect--regardless of where Sandy goes, it still has an indirect impact on Detroit and southeast Michigan because it causes a virtual log jamb in the skies.  I mean it's going to get colder and it's going to get cloudier over Michigan, over southeast Michigan this weekend.  Well if that hurricane stays off the coast, it might actually jamb things up and keep us cold or chilly for an extended period of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so how much preparation goes into a--in terms of time, goes into a--
Speaker 2: Well when the weather is good, generally good, it can be anywhere from fifteen to forty-five minutes is good.  I get into, I get into work between three and 3:30.  The first time I go on TV is just after 4:00 a.m. during the Early Today Show, and then our local news starts at 4:30.  And even before then at 4:26 I do a little weather update.  So normally I have all my stuff, I have all my ducks lined up by 4:15, 4:20.  So yeah generally a good fifteen to forty-five minutes I can get a good weather cast together.
Speaker 1: Okay and you do how many, how many broadcasts a day?
Speaker 2: Boy, last count when I last counted, this is on television because now we have the Internet, so I do that also.  When I last counted the number of weather hits that I have, it's got to be over twenty.  It's got to be somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty-five or thirty because it's at least two or three times a half hour, and then we have the Today Show and there are at least two times when I break in there, and then there's an update at 10:30, sometimes there can be another update depending on the season, and then we have the noon show and there are at least two or three updates, two or three weather appearances there also.  So all that adds up to at least twenty-five or thirty.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, and therefore the duration of a, of a segment is--
Speaker 2: It can be a short--some of them can be as short as fifteen or twenty seconds, some of them can be as long as two and a half, three minutes.
Story_ID: 23181
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So I guess I, I need to ask you like what, what are some, some of the factors that determine the weather?  Most of us look at--we see between the earth and the space is air [unclear] complicated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because the earth's atmosphere is divided up in layers.  And the layer where weather takes place is called the troposphere.  It's from here to about twelve, thirteen miles up in the atmosphere, and that's where most of our weather takes place.  And weather can vary based on pressure, temperature and all that basically has a factor on, on what happens.  What I tell kids most of the time because I get this question a lot by elementary school kids a lot, is what makes weather happen?  Well two things.  One we have the sun that warms the earth and when we're facing away from it, the earth cools.  And when the atmosphere heats up and cools down, the molecules in the atmosphere change.  They move more physically, they, they move around basically.  And a lot of those molecules include water molecules, and water is big factor in the atmosphere.  The second thing that's a huge factor is the tilt of the earth, and this is how we get our seasons.  When we're tilted toward the sun in the northern hemisphere that's when we get summer.  Tilted away, that's when we get winter.  And in between we have fall and we have spring.  And during, during the entire year as the, as the seasons change and as the days change, depending on, depending on the orientation of the earth and how the sun basically heats up the atmosphere, that drives where hot air and cold air moves.  That also drives where storms may move.
Speaker 1: Okay now there's a controversy today, though a couple of years ago it didn't seem like there was much of a controversy, over global warming.  They had a special on last night on public television about this new controversy over global warming.  We had accept--I think the public had accepted the fact that manmade gas and activities had created a warming of the atmosphere.
Speaker 2: Right.  I think the evidence shows that human beings have an effect on the atmosphere, that global warming or climate change is real, it can be real now, it's real in the future.  What I'd like to say most about it is look bad weather is basically going to happen whether there is climate change or whether there isn't.  And the reason why I say that is, is because so much of climate change or the question of global warming, or the fact of global warming as many would put it, it becomes an economic and political football that people like to bat around.  I like to think of it in more human terms of how we basically treat one another because whether human beings have an impact on the weather or not and whatever degree it happens to be, you're still going to have tornadoes, we'll still have hurricanes, we'll still have blizzards.  So matter what, bad weather is going to strike someplace somewhere, whether human beings have a hand in it or not.  So the main thing is how we treat each other.  How do we prepare before bad weather strikes, when bad weather is striking how do we try to keep people safe.  Once bad weather has moved on, how do we recover and how do, how do we rescue people.
Story_ID: 23182
Speaker 1: In that regard, do you have a critique of the 2004 hurricane that hit Louisiana, Katrina?
Speaker 2: Hurricane Katrina [2005]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean--
Speaker 1: In terms of how people were warned and prepared.
Speaker 2: Well that sort of goes straight to what I'm talking about because it's all still about human beings and the resources that--it's still all about human beings and the resources that we have.  And what can we do, what do we have available, what do we have available and what can we do to the best of our ability to try and keep people safe and alive as bad weather is striking and after bad weather strikes.  Because if you recall, a lot of the death that happened during [Hurricane] Katrina was after the hurricane struck.  You had the levees breaking, you had people who were stranded in the Superdome [The Superdome was used as a "shelter of last resort" for those in New Orleans unable to evacuate from Hurricane Katrina when it struck in late August 2005. During the storm, a large section of the outer covering was peeled off by high winds] and outside the Superdome who were either dying from heat exhaustion or from thirst or from starvation.  And then I mean when, when that happens, you're talking about effects that occur not just the immediate days afterward, but for weeks, months, maybe years on end because you have, you have a whole population that was also displaced.  That's one of the reasons why Detroit went from market size number ten being basically in the top ten, to becoming market size eleven because so many people moved from New Orleans [Louisiana] over to Houston [Texas] after Hurricane Katrina, and the movement was, was so much that it bumped up Houston to market size number ten and bumped Detroit down to market number eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay, so economic--
Speaker 2: In the TV, in the TV business that's sort of the indirect effect it had on the Detroit [Michigan] market, for better or worse, whatever you want to call it.  But nonetheless it was an effect. Okay, okay so you think there was any way--I mean is it--it seems like New Orleans [Louisiana] has hurricanes every year.  So they should--you would think they'd be at the ready for this kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Sure I mean as I--I've been Chief, I've been Chief Meteorologist at the Fox station in Toledo [Ohio], so I understand what it's like to be a manager.  So not only from my experience, but just from what I've observed from other folks who manage, who also manage, other managers or management in general.  Instead of actually blaming individuals or people, it's more about a system and whether a system is ready to handle disaster when it actually strikes, whether it's prepared--especially prepared beforehand.  Whether it's prepared beforehand.  And whether it's Hurricane Katrina, whether it's, whether it's earthquakes, another type of calamity.  Whether it's manmade or natural, in the--it's mainly about having systems in place and making sure those systems are running, running successfully at the time.  And with Hurricane Katrina, from what I, I observed, the system may have been in place but it just wasn't run as efficiently as it could have been.  And unfortunately on the down, on the big down side, that results in the loss of life.  It's very unfortunate because while it's going on and certainly afterward when hindsight is 20/20, you see those as lives that didn't have to be lost or people who got injured who didn't have to be, people who had to move who maybe didn't, didn't have to be.  But at the same time, you try to flip that around and try to take all those negative experiences for the future as something to, to learn from so we make sure we don't make those mistakes ever again.
