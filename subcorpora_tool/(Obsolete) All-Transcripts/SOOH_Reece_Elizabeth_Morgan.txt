 Finchum  Reece  Today is April 26, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library, and I   m here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to  speak with Liz Morgan Reece, regarding Henry Bellmon and her  memories of working with him through the years. This is for the  Spotlighting Oklahoma Project. Thank you for having me today.  Well, you   re very welcome. I   m glad that I had the opportunity.  Let   s start by learning a little bit about you, where you were born and  then we will work into Henry.  Okay. Well, I   m a native Oklahoman and grew up in Oklahoma City,  went to the University of Oklahoma. And actually, right after I  graduated, I took a job in Poteau, Oklahoma. And that   s where I first  met Henry Bellmon, interestingly enough, because Leflore County is not  a big household for Republicans.  What year would that have been?  That was 1962, about June, I guess. It was right after graduation. I had a  degree in journalism and went to work for the Leflore County Sun and  Poteau News. It was a biweekly.  Had politics been discussed at home?  My folks were always very interested, and my dad was a lifelong  Republican. He was born in Indian Territory, so he was kind of a unique  person, being a lifelong Republican in a state like Oklahoma that was so  heavily Democratic most of his life. But he kept up with things, and he  actually ended up in a job that he did a lot of lobbying with the  5  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  legislature. So, yes, I was exposed to it.  What did he do for a living?  He was the executive director of the Oklahoma Lumbermen   s  Association, which was a statewide membership of lumberyards  throughout Oklahoma. So he had a pretty good statewide view, too.  Do you have brothers or sisters?  I do. I have a sister who is also a journalism major from the University  of Oklahoma. And my brother, who passed away at a very young age,  was going to be a playwright and went to Columbia University in New  York City. That was very interesting for him.  A long way from Oklahoma.  Yes. Yes.  And what about your mother?  She came from Kansas, but had lived in Oklahoma most of her life and  went to OU. And I   m thinking she graduated sometime in the 1920s. She  was kind of unique as a college graduate, for a woman of that age.  Encouraged education with the kids.  Yes. Yes.  So you met Henry. How did that come about?  It was very interesting. I was the news editor of the little paper there, on  the main street office, in Poteau, and this little girl came in. She  probably was maybe six years old, maybe a little older, couldn   t even  see over the counter there. And she came in with a stack of newspapers  under her arm, and we kind of looked thinking,    What does she have?     She said,    I   m Ann Bellmon, and my daddy   s running for governor. And  he   s going to come see you, but I want you to have one of our  newspapers.    She handed us a Bellmon Times and just turned around and  walked out the door. My boss, the editor and owner of the paper, was a  big Democrat. He was active in the Democrat Party. So he kind of got to  mumbling about this guy gonna come by and see him.  So, pretty quick, Henry Bellmon walked in, and wanted to speak and  everything so my boss brought him over to me and said,    She   s probably  one of the two Republicans in Leflore County,    and that was the first  6  Finchum  Reece  time I met him. The soon to be governor, Mrs. Bellmon and the girls had  traveled all summer long throughout every county in the state doing  these things that later were called Main Street Meetings. They   d go up  and down the street. The girls would hand out the newspaper, and tell  them that their daddy was coming. He   d come along, he   d take time,  he   d shake their hands and say he was Henry Bellmon, what was their  name, and he was running for governor. And they   d ask him questions,  and he really made a connection in just a few minutes. He knew he had  to keep moving to get this all done. But, of course, he came by all the  newspapers, too, and spoke. So he was getting his name out there.  And then you ended up working for him?  I did. I started working in July of 1962, when I decided that I really was  looking for some different opportunity. I didn   t quite know what I  wanted to do, but I knew one of the staff members on his campaign staff.  I thought,    Well, this is July. The election will be in September   November , and then I will try to go over to Tulsa and get a job on the  Tulsa World,    because I figured there was no way Oklahoma was going  to elect a Republican governor. (Laughs) We had our headquarters there  in Oklahoma City. It was really an exciting time. It just kept building  and building.  They had started their group of women supporters called the Bellmon  Belles. It gave women all across the state an opportunity to get involved  in politics and use their talents in planning activities. Sometimes Henry  would go and speak with them and sometimes they   d just go by  themselves. They   d go to malls handing out literature, they   d have a  rally, they   d have a parade through town with horns honking, just  anything. They wore the dresses that Mrs. Bellmon created, and they had  a big straw hat with red, white, and blue ribbons and a red, white, and  blue striped dress that you couldn   t miss. When you   ve got more than  two or three of them together, they really were noticed.  Not every county, but just about every county in the state had a Bellmon  Belle organization that was kind of attached to the local Republican  group. They had been built up, interestingly enough, when Henry was  the state Republican chairman. He thought it was time that the party got  organized, kind of, beyond the urban areas that they can always count on  and start some real development in the rural areas. And a lot of the  counties that had never had a Republican chairman before had a  Republican chairman and vice-chairman, maybe even a secretary  treasurer. So the Bellmon Belles were kind of part of the group there,  locally, and they certainly weren   t afraid to admit that they were  Republicans. (Laughter)  7  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Did their outfits change over time?  This is something that started then and went through every single  campaign. Shirley always created the costume, or the uniform. And the  second time, in the first Senate election, there was a little spiffier dress  that had a little bell pocket with cute bows over the shoes and  everything. Then by the next time they needed some conservative outfit.  People were doing more of the sailor collars with the bows, and they had  some special material made that said Henry Bellmon on them with red,  white and blue   always red, white and blue. And then I think the last  one was kind of a little jacket with a tie that you could just throw it in  your car. If you had to get someplace and go do something official, you  could pull it out and get it on real quick. They learned a lot about that  over the years, too.  Did she actually make all of them?  She made a lot of them. And then in the later Senate campaigns, in the  last governor campaigns, by that time I think she had a cottage industry  going in Billings that was making some dresses and things that she had  designed. So I think they made a lot of them. The one I remember in the  Senate campaign, the first Senate campaign, Goodwill Industries  actually made them. People paid five dollars, something very nominal,  but they actually paid for their uniform.  One of the things in the campaign that was really kind of a laugh was  that the soon-to-be governor was running against Bill Atkinson, a rather  well-to-do editor of the Oklahoma Journal in Oklahoma City, a much  more urbane person. The Bellmon Belles were really beginning to be  noticed, and he had made some comment at one of their debates about,     Well, if he had the money to pay all those women, they   d probably be  out over the state for him, too.    Henry had to just laugh and say,     They   re all volunteers. And as a matter of fact, they pay for their own  outfits.    (Laughs) So that was, I guess, a unique thing at that time, too.  Was that unusual for women to be involved in politics at that time?  It was. At that time, 1962, a lot of women were at home, loving it and  raising children. Some of them had older children. They were seeking  activities, things to do, ways to be involved that were kind of beyond the  traditional homemaking things. They weren   t, at that point, what you  really consider a women   s libber, but they really had ideas, and they  knew what was going on, they were interested. And to have the  opportunity to get out and go and talk on the issues, and speak about this  guy that was running for governor because his big desire was to be a  public servant. And that was the kind of unique thing at that time.  8  Finchum  Reece  Toward the end of the campaigning, the last campaign, they were fitting  it in between all their jobs and their mothering and everything else that  they were doing. It was another thing on their list, but still, something  very meaningful for them.  Before we got started, you had mentioned he took a group of them to  D.C.?  Oh, that was a very interesting thing. After his election, the   he was  quite popular. One of the things I remember from all the publicity that  came out of Oklahoma, having not only the first Republican governor in  statehood, but the first Republican governor in fifty years in the southern  states. The governor, I   m pretty sure it was in New Jersey, had  traditionally been Republican, they had elected a Democrat. I think it  was like, the New York   I   m not sure what the paper was   had this  cartoon that said,    Strangers in Paradise,    and there was a caricature of  each of these governors, looking at the big chandeliers and everything  and their new offices, because this was such a unique thing.  Governor Bellmon was on a lot of lists to come and talk to people, and  he didn   t have a whole lot of time to do a lot of it. But the Republican  National Women   s Committee asked him to come to Washington D.C.  for their national meeting and tell about his election. So he took several  of the  Bellmon Belles . I think there were about six of us. We had our  dresses and everything. And when they introduced him, we came  walking down the aisle with our Bellmon signs and our Bellmon buttons  and everything. They just thought that was really unique at that time.  There weren   t a whole lot of costume corps of women involved in  politics. But the neat thing was, he created a little brochure to hand out  to all these women from across the country, and its title was,    How the  Women Won for Me.    And he really did feel that the women had made a  big difference in his campaign.  During the campaign, one of the things they did besides their main street  meetings   and this was a very time consuming thing, too   he and  Shirley and sometimes the girls, they held two-party tea parties. It was  kind of a catchy thing to say,    Okay, Oklahoma, two-party state, that   s  not a bad idea.    He would go, and he would talk to five women, he   d  talk to guys, too. He had them morning, noon, and night.  Sometimes   there   d be fifty  people  there, and he   d go around and introduce himself  to everyone. Shirley would introduce herself, and she   d get their names  and addresses and add it to the list to send all the campaign literature to.  A lot of the hostesses at these events were the women that asked their  friends, and he kind of thought that was the way to make the  connections. If you   ve got somebody handing you a brochure on the  street, you might glance at it and throw it away. If your friend from next  9  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  door said,    Come on over and meet this guy. We   re just going to have  some coffee and dessert. You will really enjoy it, and he   ll answer your  questions.    They helped in that way, too. The two-party tea parties were  quite a success.  Would any of those happen on the porch, any porch stories?  They happened all over. (Laughs) And the thing that really tickled me  was the ones that happened in the evenings. The guys could come, too,  and they still called them tea parties. (Laughs) And that   s probably all  they served, too, because that was another interesting thing about the  governor that kind of got a buzz when he was first elected because he  was kind of a stranger. And I   m not sure it was paradise, but he was a  stranger to these Oklahoma political things in a lot of ways, at least at  that level. He and Shirley talked, and they did not drink alcohol at their  home, didn   t serve it. They figured they were who they were and that  was going to be the policy in the mansion   which usually was not the  policy   and any of the things they did to entertain.  The first thing, of course, was the big inaugural ball, and so he made this  statement and the press was just tickled to death. They just thought that  was the strangest thing they ever heard, and they made a big deal out of  it. He said,    Well, it   s not a big deal. Anyone can do with a glass of cold  milk.    Well, they kind of twisted it around to say   the headlines were,     Bellmon takes buttermilk over alcohol and will not serve alcohol  during his administration.    Everywhere he went after that, literally,  every banquet he spoke at, every committee he went into, they had a big  glass of buttermilk for him. And the funny thing was he had not said  buttermilk, and he didn   t like buttermilk, particularly. (Laughs) But he  sure had a lot of it particularly over the first administration.  He  carried  the policy through everything.  Would he drink it just to be polite?  He drank some of it, I think. I think, at first, he did, and then he got to  thinking,    This isn   t going to stop happening,    so he kind of tailed back.  But the other interesting thing about that particular comment, that, again,  was just kind of an off the cuff remark for him, because that   s just who  he was, and that   s who he was going to be as governor. But it made a big  impact with the Women   s Christian Temperance Union, the WCTU.  They had chapters all over the country, at that point, and were definitely  against spirits, hard spirits. They wrote letters to the governor   s office, I  mean hundreds, commending him for his public stance   which he didn   t  even particularly think it was a stance   against serving alcohol. They  just thought that was wonderful. That was one of the first big floods of  letters that came in.  10  Finchum  Reece  Was that some of your job to go through them?  I did. I opened a lot of the mail and sorted things and even helped with  some of the answering or suggesting the writing. He was really good.  And, particularly at first, it gets to be a big, big job to try to respond  personally to everything. But he was very good about doing that, writing  a note at the end of the letter to somebody personal.  The great thing that he had done, and I think he thought this through and  did it purposefully, in creating all these party campaign people, these  party people that were the committees and the Republican committees in  the various counties and really building up these personal contacts  because he really did feel that you had to have a personal connection. He  always loved going back to the farm, because that kind of took him back  to where he could connect with reality. That   s the way people dealt with  their work and their jobs and their responsibilities, not sitting in the big  governor   s office. So he always liked going back there because he  always felt it was a connection with the people. That connection with the  people was always big for him.  At one point, he said he really didn   t want  to campaign only through the  media . As the various campaigns progressed, the media and  particularly, television advertising, and debates and all the opportunities  to be on air, became quite significant. And for a lot of other campaigns,  that was it. They sought out the television cameras, and they used their  money to buy the advertising and everything. What happened at that  point  if elected  they got in the governor   s office, and they didn   t have a  whole lot of connection with the people. They had over 200 committees,  agencies, boards that need appointees. These people were volunteers,  they weren   t paid. You had to really want to come and be on the Public  Accountancy Board or the Pardon and Parole Board or something like  that. Some people would seek them out, but mostly, he  Henry Bellmon   was looking for people that he knew, that he trusted, that he   d met, that  he knew were willing to participate, not just take the job and not show  up. He got a lot of really good appointees because of all that groundwork  he had done going around to all these counties and continued it  throughout every one of his campaigns, even though later, the media did  become a little bit more significant.  One of the fun things he did that I really got tickled with   as a brand  new graduate, you know, I knew so much. I was never quite a country-western  fan, and he knew that if we went around to these rallies in these  various towns, just to hit town and be there just wasn   t going to be  enough. So they got a country-western band that would come, and  they   d come about fifteen minutes before Henry arrived, and they   d start  11  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  playing. I mean, particularly in the rural areas. The folks came out on  Main Street just to see what was going on. They stood around and  everything and pretty soon the band leader would say,    I want you all to  meet my friend Henry Bellmon. He   s here and he   s running for  governor.    And he   d step up, and he   d make some remarks. The band  would be packing up their instruments. They   d slip on off the stage and  go to the next town to set up. And Henry would speak and answer  questions and get back on the bus and head to the next town. That was  another unique thing about his campaigning, was just the way he thought  through to attract people, to come to something that was not a popular  idea, a Republican running.  It sounds like you   d have to be very organized to get all of that just  clicking.  Yes. And, of course, his family supported him. It was such a change for  them. They had talked about it when he first took the job as Republican  state chairman that this was going to be something   these weren   t  money-making things, for sure. The farm was the money-making thing,  but they   d be away from the farm. And they discussed that and what  they would do, and they all pitched in and helped and did a lot of the  campaigning, did a lot of the work at home when he couldn   t be there.  Well, talk a little bit about election night, the first election night.  Oh, it was very exciting because, at that point, they   d had several  debates. I don   t even know if they were televised, but the steam was  building. You could just tell. It was one of those things where you   they  always talk about peaking at the right time. Well, nobody really thought  the peaking was really going to happen, but more and more  encouragement. I remember the small campaign staff that we had, and  we all put in a dollar and a number by how much he was going to win  by. Well, they had said he had to win by twenty thousand votes just to  assure the election, because a recount or something, they could slip  things away. So there were people thinking,    Gosh, we   ve got to win by  twenty thousand. Are we going to win at all?    (Laughs) And I thought I  was going to be so brave and everything, and I, for some reason  remember, I put down we were going to win by 33,000 votes. And I  thought,    I   m sure that I   m going to win this pot.     His brother, George, put down something like 42,000, or something like  that. I thought,    Well, he   s really going out there     and, actually, he was  the one that won the pot. That night was just so very exciting. Of course,  the staff was just thrilled. We were just giddy and everything. Poor  Henry and Shirley were going from Oklahoma City over to thank the  folks in Tulsa. I mean, I think it was an all-nighter for them, for sure.  12  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Then, of course, coming back the next day and the press were after  them   I mean he was probably standing there   he was really good at  going to sleep at various times, because he got up so early in the  morning. (Laughs) And I don   t know how he stood being up all night  and putting that forth, a lot younger at that time.  No time for rest, either.  No, no, it just kept on going, and they made it all. It   d be interesting to  know how many miles they put on   they had a station wagon that they  traveled with the girls in. And then toward the last of the campaign, I  think they did a little bit of flying, but not much.  I wonder if he had a map or if he just knew where   ?  I   m not sure. But I know that they crossed off everything they did, and  they made sure that they got to all the places they needed to.  So they probably had one then. What about swearing in day?  Well, it was cold, cold, cold, I can tell you that for sure. I remember  sitting out on the steps of the capitol. And I have pictures, and everyone  is just bundled up in their coats and hats and gloves and everything  because it was kind of like what they say about it   ll be a cold day when a  Republican is elected governor in Oklahoma, evidently it came true.  (Laughter) The one thing I do remember from   he did have a great pull  together and a bunch of volunteers again to plan an inauguration because  this was something very special. They were going to have it at the  capitol, and I don   t know that they usually had them at the capitol, then.  They usually had them in a hotel or something. But they were going to  actually have it at the capitol. We had committees that set up some  displays of historical things about Oklahoma, and committees that  planned the food, and committees that did all these different things. So  they had a big, big celebration going.  Then, that afternoon before all the celebrating started, they had the  inaugural ceremony. And the one thing I remember from his speech was  his comment that it   s very interesting being involved in politics, and  different people had approached him about different things, and he  wanted to assure people that when he got something that needed his  attention that he would give it his serious and thoughtful attention, but  he wasn   t going to be pressured about anything. He said he wanted them  just to know that he would forgive and remember anybody that tried to  pressure him into anything. (Laughs) He wanted to be quite independent  in that way.  13  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  The one funny way that   I guess it   s the funny way   that he expressed  it was he said he was going to take no gifts. He said no gifts. Different  people would bring in something from their town they were proud of or  something like that. But he said, no, he wouldn   t accept any gifts. And  somebody had not donated, had left it on loan, at the mansion, a grand  piano, so he asked them to come and pick it up. They said,    Oh, you can  have this. This is something that the mansion can enjoy.    And he said,     Well, no,    he didn   t want to be beholding, so they picked it up. I went  with Shirley, because the girls were taking piano lessons. And we went  to downtown Oklahoma City, and we were trying to pick out a piano  that they could afford to put in the mansion for the girls to use.  It was really kind of funny because, at that point, they weren   t  immediately recognizable, I guess he more than Shirley. They couldn   t  figure out, we came in looking at pianos and talking about cost and  everything. Finally, you could kind of hear them whispering over in the  corner, and the manager came up, and he recognized that this was the  next first lady of Oklahoma. (Laughs) And so they were quite helpful in  trying to pick out the piano that they would buy. I think they took it with  them when the administration was over. The other thing I remember,  even at Christmastime when people would bring by a box of candy or  something, he would say,    Make sure that you don   t accept that,    and I  would be in the front office, and so I   d have to hand it back to them.  (Laughs) They were kind of curious, but they got the idea.  Since you were opening the mail, were there any letters from Democrats  who were disappointed that a Republican was elected?  Well, one I particularly remember was from my former boss, who said I  had been an idiot to leave this good employment and everything to go  with a Republican candidate, and he  Henry Bellmon  was going to go  nowhere, and the Republicans in Oklahoma would never be successful.  (Laughs) So I don   t know, I don   t think he was around when we had all  our congressional delegations as Republicans.  Back then  we had Page  Belcher in Washington and then Henry Bellmon came along.  Was your office in the capitol, then, since you were his receptionist?  Yes, yes. Yes, it was. It was much smaller than it is now, much smaller  than it was his second term in office. But the thing that was kind of  funny is the area across the hall where they kept a lot of the letterhead  and envelopes and things like that, were vaults that had originally been  there because the state treasury   s office was next door to us. There were  about three or four big vaults with big heavy doors. I guess they kept the  state   s money or something in them originally, but they were turned into  kind of office space. And now, they   ve been all redone and everything.  14  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  That   s part of the whole governor   s office now. They had the Blue  Room, which was kind of the official greeting room and where he held  his press conferences and everything. It was kind of interesting because  even after his no-gifts policy, the Republican  Women , a group of  ladies that had worked really hard for him, had bought a Steuben glass  elephant. And I   m not even sure he knew what Steuben glass was. It was  a small thing, and it was really pretty. And they were so heartbroken that  he didn   t want to accept it. So, finally, in the Blue Room there was a  bookcase and each governor had left something from their  administration. And he said that he would put that in that cabinet to  leave as a reminder of his administration. It was quite appropriate,  because it was probably the only elephant ever there.  I wonder if it   s still there.  It is. (Laughs) I   m not sure that they still have that exhibit though,  because last time I was there, I looked and I didn   t see. I can   t even  remember some of the other things governors had left. But they were all  kind of unique, something about their administration. So that was kind  of interesting.  Anything else about his first term as governor that just pops out?  Well, one thing that really tickled me that I do remember   because one  of the pieces of legislation that was going through the legislature at that  time was whether to accept daylight savings time or not. It was a  controversial issue back there in the    60s. People would call and write  letters about yea or nay on daylight savings time. I got this call from this  one little lady, and she was so upset. She just did not think that the  governor should sign this,    God made Central Standard Time, and he  didn   t intend for us to change it     (Laughs) I think it was ultimately     and the farmers were kind of concerned because the cows wouldn   t  know what time it was, I guess, and they would get up so early. (Laughs)  Anyway, we had a lot of comments like that, but it finally passed. And  now, I think people kind of can   t wait for daylight savings time to come.  (Laughs)  The other thing that was really interesting at that time, and I don   t think  the governor had anything to do with this, but we had sonic boom testing  going on over Oklahoma City. They would come every  morning  and it  got to the point where they lasted so long that  when they finished  testing  people would be late for work, because they didn   t hear that  sonic boom. That was how they woke up. So we got a lot of calls about  it when it started and then when it stopped again. I   m not even sure what  they were testing for.  15  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Oh, the other thing that I do remember very clearly, because I sat at the  front desk, the governor and teachers and particularly the OEA were not  in that administration. He had a no new tax policy that he   d run on and  was working really hard to keep that as a promise. Teachers    salaries  were not high, and they were really upset. The OEA got very involved in  this and really started saying that they needed the funding for this. And,  at that point in the budget, it wasn   t there. He had to say,    I appreciate  education. My mother was a teacher,    all this stuff,    But we don   t have  the money.    That really upset the OEA so they came to the capitol. And  I   m not sure this ever happened before or maybe since, but they had one  thousand teachers walk through the governor   s office. He said,    You can  come.    They were to come stand out with their placards and everything.  He said,    Come on up to the office if you want to, but I have to do what  I have to do.    And so they did. They thought,    Okay, ha  We   ll take it      So there were one thousand of them that walked through, signed the  registration book, walked in one end and walked out the other. And he  was out of town at the time, which I think they thought was on purpose.  But at any rate, it was a big day there and there was lots of comments in  the paper about the protest going through the governor   s office, actually  in the office.  They just signed and felt like they accomplished a little something.  Yes, they did. Kind of let them have some steam off. I   m pretty sure  some of them wrote a little comment or something. (Laughs) The  interesting thing was at the end of his four-year administration, there had  been a raise for teachers so it wasn   t just that he was ignoring it. He was  doing the best he had with what you have. That   s what the budget is all  about.  Well, did the girls come to visit much while he was in office?  They were quite active. They didn   t come to the office that much, they  were in school. I do remember that one of the things that Ann  particularly wanted was a puppy dog. So we had to see about whether  they were ever going to get the puppy dog. And sure enough, they got a  little dachshund, and they named him Tandem. And Pat was involved  with the band in Billings and had led the Billings band in the inaugural  parade. She was the drum major. They went to public school. They  adjusted quite well. They always seemed to be able to stay in the public  scrutiny without any trouble. That   s, literally, the way they grew up.  While he was in office, did he get to the office at a certain time and stay  until the wee hours of the morning, or what was his schedule?  Well, kind of the opposite of that. (Laughs) He got there in the wee  16  Finchum  Reece  hours of the morning, and I know one of my friends who worked with  him at the Senate   he carried this habit because, as a farmer, he got up  early. He would be over at the office at five a.m. on a regular basis, and  then he would be home early and go to bed early, too. But in  Washington, D.C., he arrived  early  in  the morning as  they were  working on something so his staffer was with him. It was about four  a.m., and the security didn   t recognize him so they had to ask for his  identification. And then they were just mortified when they found out it  was a United States senator they had stopped and carded. (Laughter) He  just thought that was the funniest thing, and my friend said,    Yes, a lot  of guys would   ve probably had somebody lose their job over not being  recognized, but not Henry Bellmon.     So the first term is over. Then what happens?  The other unique thing   I   ll just throw it in here   about Henry  Bellmon, through all these times, you didn   t ever want to work for  anyone else. (Laughs) Of course, everybody has to, sooner or later, go to  work for another boss, but he was, without a doubt, the best boss you  could ever imagine. As a matter of fact, being as young as I was and not  having had a lot of experience, I didn   t realize that all people were not as  good as Henry Bellmon to their staff. He always wrote you personal  notes if he saw something that you   d done that was maybe a little extra,  or just noticed things. He and Shirley always thought of something  creative to give for gifts at Christmas, something from their hearts that  were just really, really thoughtful.  There were various trips that he had to make and usually needed a little  staff help. And so everyone from the receptionist up to the legal aid or  the administrative assistant got to choose one of these things to go with  him on. It was just a real opportunity. We went to some of the national  conventions with him, things like that, when the state wasn   t paying for  it. It was just a really neat opportunity. But, I mean, people are just so  loyal to him, and it was really kind of interesting because this happened  with every staff. I worked with the first staff and some of the staffs in  Washington and then the last staff, too. There were different people  along the way, always, but every one of them had that feeling about him.  And it   s not that he did anything special, he was just who he was.  One of the funny things was when he went to Washington, people could  not get there fast enough to open the door for him. They would get really  confused when he would want to open the door for them. He would just  open the door and stand back and let them go in first. They would just  kind of stop, and they didn   t know if they should go in or what. (Laughs)  But that   s just the kind of person he was with everyone, equally. It was  not just the bigwigs or anything like that, it was everyone that helped  17  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  him. One of the funny things after he was no longer in office   I can   t  remember what the occasion was   but it was some award he was given  or some citation, and it was presented on the floor of the House of  Representatives, there at the state capitol.  We went up, and we were going to watch whatever the proceeding was.  It was a couple of us from the staff, and we came in and sat down and  soon, some other people from other places came in. I   m sitting next to a  friend of mine that worked at the capitol and she said,    How do you  know all these people?    I said,    Well, they   re all his former staff.    She  said,    These people all worked for him?    I said,    Yes, but, I mean, this  is over the years.    She said,    But they still come.    I said,    Yes, and they  always will,    and they always did. So, very, very, very interesting the  way he could relate to people that way.  Did he ever fire anyone?  I think he did. I don   t know if he actually fired them as much as kind of  eased things out.  Encouraged them to     Yes, I think there was some cases where it just didn   t click. But,  basically, if you held up your end of the bargain and were responsible,  he would certainly be there for you.  Once he finished that term, then he started campaigning? He decided to  run for senator?  He debated and a lot of people thought that he would go directly from  the governor   s office into a campaign. He said he wanted to think about  it. So the next campaign was two years. Senator Mike Monroney, he had  been in office for a long time and was a good senator from Oklahoma.  That was who he took on and again ran a campaign remarkably. I mean,  by that point, people kind of knew what to expect. They liked what they  saw of him, and he won the election and went to Washington D.C. Of  course, let   s see. I think he served two terms. It wasn   t three, it was two.  Yes, the two six-year terms, and he really wanted to come home. They  talk about term limits now, and he kind of self-limited his term. He  always said being governor of Oklahoma was much better than being a  United States senator. That   s when he came home and by that time he  could have succeeded himself as governor. That was the first person that  could have, because Oklahoma had a one four-year term limit. They  raised it to two.  So he still had that extra term that he could do, and he came back and  18  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  ran again and had been through lots of issues that were very  controversial. One was the bussing, one was the Panama Canal. He  listened to people, he did his research, and he voted his way. A lot of  people didn   t appreciate all those votes so he didn   t know whether he  was going to be really well accepted as a Republican candidate in  Oklahoma at that point. So his campaign was a little bit different. He  still went around to all the counties and everything, but he kind of left it  as,    They know me now. If they want me, they can vote for me.    And he  got elected again. And, actually, I think he could have done another term  after that because it was something about consecutive terms, but decided  not to run the last time. And that was his last stand in government. But  he was definitely a public servant. He served because he thought people  needed to be a part of the things that were governing them.  How did he transition and how did you, as the staffer, transition from  Oklahoma to D.C.?  Well, that was very interesting because he was very loyal to people, and  he said,    If you want to come, there   ll be a job for you.    And he, of  course, liked the staff that was familiar. As a matter of fact, he was very  determined that his staff be all Oklahomans, and so most of these people  that had worked for him during the governor   s term and everything, his  administrative assistants and things, went with him. He asked,    Do you  want to go?    And I said,    Well, I   ve lived in Oklahoma all my life, and I  don   t know whether I   ll like Washington.    I can remember him very  clearly, sitting in the office with him, and he said,    Will you come?     And I said,    I don   t want to come and leave you in the lurch if I can   t  stay or don   t want to stay. I don   t want you to take time to find a  position for me that       and he said,    I don   t care, you come. And if you  want to stay three months or three years, whatever you would like to do.  Just come and see.    I don   t think I would have gone if he hadn   t said  that, but I   m so glad I did   mainly because that   s where I met my  husband. (Laughter)  Tell us a little about that.  Well, he actually had gone up to work for a congressman from Texas,  and then he had the opportunity to work for the Farmers Home  Administration with Jim Smith, who was from Oklahoma. He was the  director of the Farmers Home Administration, so he did a lot of  Oklahomans. And that   s where we met and got married, and our kids  were born there, and so, yes, as a personal sideline, that was a pretty  good deal for me. (Laughs)  He wasn   t from Oklahoma, then, I take it?  19  Reece  Finchum  Reece  He was from Texas, yes. He was Republican, worked for Republican  campaigns. And actually, when I left the senator   s office, when my little  girl was born, he was already, I think, working for the Senate Committee  on Agriculture, which Senator Bellmon was a part of at that point. So he  maintained a close tie with the Bellmon administration, too. And then  we moved back to Oklahoma, and he did some volunteer work as a  member of the State Board of Education and later, helped with a lot of  the education issues in the second term of governor.  Another kind of interesting thing, and I was thinking about this the other  night, and I thought,    I never took it as the royal we, but Henry Bellmon  would always say,    We are governor, and that means that you are as  much as I am. You are the working part of this. This isn   t going to work  unless we are governor.       So he always said that, and every time he said     we are governor,    he meant the whole staff and everything. I never  connected that with the royal we until I heard other people talking about     we    instead of saying    me.    It   s kind of interesting, but that   s another  way he joined people together. And he loved to be called    The Gov,     because that   s what we always called him.  What did you guys do for fun in D.C.?  It   s really an interesting place to move and particularly, as I said, I   d  grown up in Oklahoma. I was pretty much a home grown. But in  Washington, D.C., everyone is from someplace else. (Laughs) So it   s not  like you   re moving into a town where everybody knows everybody and  everything about them, but you don   t. They had the Oklahoma State  Society. These were people from all the Congressional offices, staff, or  just Oklahomans that worked in the government   or just worked in  Washington, D.C. So that was always fun. They always had parties, and  they   d have the Cherry Blossom festivals, they   d have the Oklahoma  Queens. And I think   I want to say Gail. I   m not sure. I think it was  Gail   was Oklahoma   s Cherry Blossom Princess one year. There was  just always something going on in Washington.  The other fun thing was there are so many things close by, the historical  part of it. You could run up to Gettysburg in an hour, an hour and a half,  or things like that were just fascinating. (Laughs) Go to the beach, which  of course, we in Oklahoma don   t get to do that frequently. But there was  just a whole lot going on in Washington and always something  interesting. The senators could partake in a whole lot of it if they wanted  to. And I think Henry and Shirley both did what was appropriate for  them, but they weren   t the late-night group that was out every night at  somebody   s big fancy party or anything. They pretty well kept their  schedules going.  20  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  I remember once Henry went back to the farm, went back to Oklahoma  and was going to be at the farm, and Shirley asked him to bring   I want  to say some okra back with him. I can   t remember what it was   but he  put it in his bag. And for some reason or another, they opened the bag  and were wondering    What in the hell?    I guess they thought it was  some kind of illegal something or other that this guy was carrying  through the airport, this treat from Oklahoma for his wife. (Laughter)  But, yes, we were up there during   the first thing, really, historical thing  that happened, was President Eisenhower passed away. And I can  remember standing on the steps of the Old Senate Office Building  watching his procession come through the Capitol for the services and  everything, which was just amazing for somebody from Oklahoma. I   m  here, and this was the former president of the United States. We were  there when Nixon resigned, which, of course, was another big-time issue  and all that was going on at that time. We were there during the Vietnam  War, and that was a lot of protesting and new thinking going on that  was   really, just kind of getting to live history. That was really  fascinating.  So you stayed the whole twelve years with him?  We were up there until 1976, which was the bicentennial year. And I  thought that was a really strange time to leave. My husband worked as  an appointee of President Ford and had the opportunity to come back to  Oklahoma and work for the Ozark Regional Commission. So that   s  when we came back. I think that was maybe at least six years, maybe  eight, that he had been in office at that point. Yes, it was eight because  we had come back from Washington to help in that campaign for the  second term in the Senate. And we did bus tours and things with them.  That was really some of the funnest part, was going to do the campaign  part. The work part was hard. (Laughs)  Did he enjoy any particular song, like when the country band played,  did he have a favorite?  I do remember, I think it was the Senate campaign, he told me that he  liked these country western folks because he grew up with Bob Wills.  He said everybody turned out for Bob Wills no matter where he went.  And I was kind of going,    Who is Bob Wills?    I, since, have learned a  lot about who he is and do appreciate his music. But one of the guys that  played for Bob Wills was Leon McAuliffe, and so he went with us on  the first Senate campaign, on the tours. One thing that everybody that  was a Bob Wills fan knew was that at some point during his concert, he  would say,    Take it away, Leon     and Leon would play the steel guitar.  That evening of the election, of the first time for the Senate, Henry got a  telegram from Leon McAuliffe that said,    Take it away, Henry      21  Finchum  Reece  (Laughter) I   m not sure what the favorite songs were, but I know that  was the favorite artist.  He probably sang    Oklahoma?     I   m sure that that must have been a part of it. I don   t know if you   d call  him a patron of the arts, but he really had a sense of the arts in  Oklahoma. And I can remember one of his great campaign supporters  from Muskogee came and brought this young Indian artist with her to  meet the governor. She said she wanted him to see what talent there was.  Well, his young guy sat out in the front office as they waited for their  appointment and was sketching on a piece of notebook paper or  something. And one of my friends there in the office said,    Oh, that was  lovely. Could she have it?    And he said,    Yes,    and she said,    Would  you sign it?    And he signed it Jerome Tiger and gave it to her. (Laughs)  I   ve been a fan of his ever since. I always thought,    Oh, wow     You  could have had a real piece of art here that was very unique, just one of  his sketches that were just fabulous.  One of the other people I will always remember is Willard Stone, and he  was just delightful. He did such beautiful work with wood, and Henry  loved wood. One of the pieces of, kind of, art that he gave us as his staff  members, when they had built their house, they had to take down some  oak trees, and he   d had it preserved and had some boxes carved out of  that for the staff and for other friends, that were actually a part of his  homestead there, up in Billings. That was so meaningful. He also had a  desk made from this that was in the governor   s office with him so he  loved wood, himself. Of course, Willard Stone just did such beautiful  things in wood.  As a matter of fact, he left a carving called    Man of Respect,    I think  that was the name of it. That was about Henry Bellmon. He wrote this  lovely thing, Willard Stone did, this lovely comment about why he  carved it this way, and what it meant to him, and why he thought it was  about Henry Bellmon, why he thought it spoke so well of Henry  Bellmon. But the thing that I always remember about Willard Stone is  that he was just really fun to talk to. He had had, I think it was an  accident where he had cut off three of his fingers. Well, here he was  carving just beautiful things with his left hand and his thumb and a  finger. He always,    Oh, well, he just cut them off because they got in the  way.    (Laughs) I think the governor said he was representing  Oklahoma   at that point, they were called the Handicap Conference. Of  course, he wasn   t handicapped at all, but he did have a situation that he  had to work through. He was marvelous, and he was great friends with  the Bellmons. He did a thing to kind of symbolize Shirley as well, with a  little hat and a feather like the Bellmon Belles.  22  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  When they were living in the mansion, do you have any interesting  stories from that time period?  One of the kind of interesting things   and maybe it   s true with all  administrations   but Shirley did a lot of the cooking. She didn   t have a  big kitchen staff. She had a social secretary who lived in the apartment  over the garage. And so when they had a group to serve or something,  Shirley and her social secretary would do most of the cooking. One of  the favorites was pecan pie, and you could always tell when she was  cooking pecan pies. The other interesting thing was, in those days,  security was maybe a little less than it is required to be now. (Laughs)  But they had a front desk there, as you walked into the mansion that you  would check in with. It was manned by, basically, college students,  basically law students. It was kind of an honor to get to be that. And  these were another part of the group that would always show up  everywhere Henry Bellmon went, any of these guys that had been  guards at the mansion. They really knew the Bellmons and the girls, and  they were there to call if anything went wrong or they needed any help,  but a very informal security system. So that was interesting. Shirley did  a little bit of redecorating. She always would do some things that she  would hand-make. I think she worked on some curtains and things like  that for the mansion.  Did they have a beauty shop in the   ?  They did at the capitol. I don   t remember the mansion, but they did at  the capitol. It was for anyone that worked there. They, basically, could  use it.  They probably don   t anymore, do you think?  Not that I   ve seen the last several years, and I haven   t been there for  quite a while. But when Henry finally went out of office and I had to get  a real job   the other was never work, it was always fun   but I used to  go to the capitol quite a bit, and I never did see it.  We have heard rumors that the girls would be on the top of the capitol     before the dome   and would climb up on the lions?  I   m not sure about that. I think they did ride the banister down the  staircase in the mansion several times. I know there are probably some  really fun things that I have forgotten from those days. It   s been  expanded a lot, and actually, even after his second term of office, but  they kept it pretty much as a home. They did, I think, some of the  planting and things like that. They had flowers and things around all the  23  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  time and tried to use it. They   d have people over for all kinds of events. I  think they did a wild game party for the press. Henry was a great hunter,  and so some of the common things, the quail and things like that that  Shirley would fix, but then they did some other kind of wild game. And  I   m not even sure what it was, but she fixed it all, and it was kind of a  special treat for the press, too. They were always very frank about him,  but they always really admired him, too.  She was a good cook, then?  Oh, she was definitely a good cook, and she did lots of canning and all  the things particularly on the farm, they did.  Did she do some of that while she was still in   ?  I think so. I think so. I know she did lots of the cooking. I think she did  some of the canning, too. Even when we went to Washington, she would  do things. She started in Washington with a line of dresses that were  sold at Julius Garfinckel   s, which was one of the nice stores downtown  there in Washington and the district. They were kind of shirt-waist  dresses that were popular at that time, but they all had a hand-painted  emblem from  Oklahoma . I think she started doing the border states as  well, but like, for Oklahoma, they   d have wheat, or they   d have the  Scissor-tailed Flycatcher. They were just very creative dresses. And  Julius Garfinckel   s picked them up and sold them for a while. And then  she started her little industry in Billings where they did a lot of work.  Then she started with the dolls, and the dolls were very, very popular.  They made a lot of those in Billings, too, so she was always doing  something. She loved to try new things. She   d do stained glass or she  would work on something that she hadn   t tried before. She loved doing  that kind of thing.  Didn   t she come up with a slogan for something to do with litter?  Yes,    Don   t lay that trash on Oklahoma,    was that it?  Or    Our Land is Grand,    or something? One of those.  And she did a commercial that was really just funny. They came up to a  tollgate or something, rolled the window down, and it was the first lady.  She said,    Don   t lay that trash on Oklahoma.    That was one of her   and  the wildflower beautification projects, too. They   re still on some of the  roads around Oklahoma and the turnpikes and everything, there   s some  of the seeds that she was very influential in getting, spreading around,  and getting people to plant wildflower plots.  24  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Do you have some fond memories of visits to the farm?  Well, they were always so nice to have people come to the farm. And  actually, I tried to remember the last time was   I guess at one of his  birthdays when he was in his    80s, I believe. That was after Shirley was  gone. But throughout all the times, they would have either a holiday  party or just a summer party or something and share their home, which  they had built. They   d started out their married life in the old farmhouse  that had been his family   s and finally decided that that was just going to  be too much work to keep up to the standards. So they built this house,  planed their own wood, and did the drawings, had the little pond out  front and everything that was used for fishing   it wasn   t little, it was  pretty big   a beautiful porch, just a real pretty place that they had  worked really, really hard to  complete , and about the time that he was  elected. (Laughs) They got it all finished the way they wanted to and, of  course, they moved back and forth over the years, but the farm was  always their home.  The other thing that I always like to say about the farm and probably  other people remember this as well was the governor had made a  comment that there was a gravel road to his house outside of Billings,  Oklahoma, and that there always would be. And they all said,    The  governor can just point his finger and get a road built,    and so the press  would always go up there, wondering if that gravel  was still there , and  I   m pretty sure, to this very day, it   s still a gravel road. (Laughs) It was  the last time I was up there so they never did pave the road to his house,  which a lot of the governor   s could have requested and had done without  much trouble. (Laughs) And sometimes it gets pretty rough with the  rains and things and the snow.  Were you really surprised when he decided not to do the Senate another  term?  Not surprised so much that he didn   t do the Senate another term, but I  was somewhat   I don   t know if I was surprised as much as I was kind  of disappointed that he didn   t try the governor   s race again. There was  so much going on. He had accomplished so much, all the education  stuff. He had shown himself   perhaps, he had always been this way, but  I don   t think it was ever as apparent as it was during all that debate over  House Bill 1017, and what Oklahoma needed for education, and how we  were going to move forward, and what we   d have to do to be there     how much he was a give-and-take person. He was very stubborn. He  held to his beliefs, but he was never hesitant to listen to somebody else  to try to be convinced, to say,    Okay, I understand what you   re saying.  Do you understand what I   m saying? Can we meet and get this done?     25  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  I think maybe at that point, during the first term, all the Republican Party  was so excited to have a Republican in office. At the end of the second  term, I   m not so sure that they were as excited about Henry Bellmon as  representing and leading the Republican Party in Oklahoma, because he  was just so sensible. He was so sensible, and you couldn   t push him.  You couldn   t make him do anything he didn   t want to do, but you could  talk to him, and he would listen to you. And that   s how things get done.  You just can   t say,    I   m drawing the line in the sand, and don   t step  across it,    because that line will be there and nothing else will happen.  I wonder how he came to be that way.  I   m not sure. I think it   s just his style of leadership, actually. And he  probably didn   t think as much of himself as everybody else thought of  him. (Laughs) He probably didn   t think he was a know-it-all, though he  did. He researched things, he studied things. He didn   t just make snap  judgments. He really followed his beliefs, but he also knew that if you  were going to   I mean, compromise was not a good word at that point,  but it doesn   t get done if you can   t give a little and take a little.  I think, basically, his record speaks for itself. When he left office, it was  definitely on the high with a lot of the   Steve Lewis and Ted Fisher and  a lot of the Democratic   Bob Cullison, all Democrats, that stood up and  helped him get that through. When he originally introduced House Bill  1017, they had to search really hard for somebody to introduce it  because the Democrats weren   t knowing what was going on, and the  Republicans didn   t think it was worth anything. So they found one guy  that would introduce it and barely got it started. And from there, it went  on to grow into a commission that was statewide and lots of support and  that type of thing. Ultimately, they had a referendum on it after it was  passed, and it passed again, so, anyway. And it was signed here in Tulsa,  because Tulsa gave such great support to that effort. I know somebody  else that can talk about this a lot better than I can. (Laughter)  Any other memories you want to share?  I think I   ve about said everything that I can remember.  Anything that is not commonly or widely known about him? Besides the  buttermilk, I mean    (Laughter)  I don   t know. I think the one word that repeatedly comes up when  people are asked to describe him is integrity. I think his record just  speaks for itself. I tell you what, I wish more than anything that there  were more Henry Bellmons, and particularly, in our world right now.  26  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Well, I understand that he had a little, I don   t know if difficulty is the  word, but buying suits and getting tuxes?  Oh, that was another thing. During his first administration, he wasn   t  going to wear a cockeyed   quote,    cockeyed    tux. And he didn   t for the  longest time. I think when they went to Washington, it might have been  the first time, when he had something to do at the White House, that he  actually broke down and wore a tux. If we look back at his first  inauguration pictures, they were all in their long dresses and everything,  and he had a tie, but he wasn   t going to wear a cockeyed tux. The other  funny thing   Doc Jordan, the guy that kind of ran the public relations  part of his campaign and everything, had a real hard time figuring out  how he could get Henry to wear long socks. When he was sitting up on  the stage his pants would come up and there   d be   his short socks and  then some skin and then his pants. (Laughs) They just didn   t think that  was appropriate for the candidate to be sitting up there on the stage. So  he bought him a pair of long socks. And I think the governor ultimately  wore them, but he didn   t like them too well. He only wore them, I think,  when he was going to sit on stage.  The other thing that was kind of funny about Henry Bellmon is because  he did get to work awfully early and worked awfully hard, he wasn   t real  good in the evening. I remember going to some conference, I think Dean  Rusk was the keynote speaker. All I could do during the whole thing   was try to keep him awake . I think it was the Southern Governors     Conference, perhaps. There were sixteen or thirteen of them at the head  table. Fortunately, he was kind of down at the end. Dean Rusk was  talking and you see this (gestures head nodding), and there were lots of  comments about him going to sleep. Well, the next conference like that  that we went to, they kind of had a break as they cleared the dishes, and  he got up, came down, and sat at the staff table. I thought,    Well, that  was nice of him,    because they were going to go to the keynote next  after they had this little break. (Laughs) Well, he didn   t get up and go  back and sit at the head table. (Laughs) I remember he was sitting next  to me, and he started nodding off. I kind of started moving some  silverware around and pretty soon, I just gave up because he was at least  smart enough to get up and get off the platform and come down and nod  off in the audience instead. (Laughs) You knew he was working hard.  Just a power nap.  Yes, yes, exactly. (Laughter) Another funny story at one of those  conferences was because of his stand, he didn   t drink liquor. But when  you went to one of these   particularly the Southern Governors     Conference   I guess it   s southern hospitality, and it was very important  for that state. These were gifts that, I think, he pretty well accepted. I  27  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  think he passed a lot of them on, but the state would have the things that  they made there for all the governors. And it would be rude not to have  accepted some of the things that they wanted to show off their state with.  They would always have their accommodations. They would always  have their liquor cabinets stocked, just really well. The governor got  there   and the press usually came, too. The governor got there one time,  and he looked and the press was there. He said,    You guys, if you want  this, you take it. I don   t need it.    (Laughs) Some of the guys took  some   or I think they probably took it all. The next day, they   d  restocked it all, because they were going to take good care of these  important guests of theirs. Everything that was used got restocked  immediately. I think he stopped giving it away because he knew they  were just going to fill it up again. (Laughter)  Did word get out that he was contributing?  Yes, well, he didn   t have to work very hard to do that. The press was  pretty well used to that type of thing.  One of the other things he did when he was first governor, again, just  kind of a new twist on things   it had been very popular and, I think, still  is quite popular. If you could get a proclamation from the governor   s  office, if it was somebody who   d retired or had done good work for a  special week you were having, just anything, they would want a  proclamation.    It   s such a good thing that they have this flower show.  We are just so pleased.    They want to name this day, the special flower  day for whatever county or whatever city. There were just lots of them,  and they took lots of time and lots of effort to write. He didn   t see much  sense in it so he wrote a column about how he would not be doing  proclamations during his administration, which did kind of upset some  people that really thought that was a good thing to be able to go to the  governor for. But he said he just didn   t see any reason to glorify a  pickle. Well, he got a letter back from the National Pickle Association  about his comments about glorifying a pickle. (Laughs) But he didn   t do  proclamations, for sure.  Anything else like that he changed?  Just kind of the whole demeanor. It was a very open office. I mean, I  don   t know that the other offices had been particularly closed or  anything, but just very easy going. You could pretty well take his word  for it. If he was going to do it, he   d do it, and you could count on him.  What do you see as his legacy for Oklahoma?  28  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Well, I think, basically, that he was in public service for the right  reasons. He had a very strong, strong feeling of responsibility of  citizens. He had a strong feeling about conducting yourself in a manner  that was for the good of the people and for the commonwealth of the  people. He acted with great integrity. Not everybody always liked  exactly what he was doing or anything, but I think to a person,  everybody respected Henry Bellmon. When you say his name, they  just   yes, they kind of wish there were more of him.  He crossed party lines quite a bit. He appointed, like, Hannah Atkins.  Oh, yes. Hannah is a delightful person. He appointed her to Secretary of  State. Integration was on the verge at that point, but it was not wholly  accepted. He had the first black staff member in the governor   s office,  my dear friend Beulah Ponder. And he sought out people of quality of  all characters. I don   t know that he actually pushed that issue as much as  he just made it something that just looked very, very normal. Hannah  was certainly a multitalented person and probably one of the first cabinet  secretaries who was a woman and a black, and that was significant. I  think I talked about the fact that he had the first governor   s Commission  on the Status of Women and appointed women from all over the state  that came and gave him advice and researched issues for him and  brought forth things they were interested in, and he was always willing  to listen. I think maybe the fact that he acted with integrity and that he  was glad to listen to people and that he never put anyone down.  It sounds like he had a little foresight, too.  Yes, yes, he did. Things that irritated him and made him mad, it would  just make him bristle. He could just put behind him immediately  knowing that there was no reason that he needed to spend any time  trying to get back at people, trying to change things that happened. He  could let things go, and he could work with people. He did remember,  but he could forgive and remember. (Laughs)  That may be a good way to end, unless you have anything else you want  to add before we close?  I think I have talked myself   and probably you   out. (Laughter)  I appreciate your time. It   s been great. Good stuff.  Well, it can   t be anything but good because he   s such a remarkable  person.  Did you call him Henry or did you call him governor?  29  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Reece  Finchum  Basically, and even when he was in the Senate, it was very hard to  switch to Senator Bellmon. But, basically, every time I think it was the  governor. In trying to explain things that happened before he was  governor, I still started calling him the governor before he was even  elected, but that was just the way I will always think of him. (Laughs)  And he connected you with your husband, you said. So good things.  Yes, I   ll always think of him that way, too. Yes, and his wonderful  family, just a real blessing. Really great to be a staff member, but to be a  friend, too.  Well, he was a friend to Oklahoma, too.  Certainly was. Certainly was. I think he impressed a lot of people that  didn   t know Oklahoma, particularly when he was in Washington, that  had no idea about what Oklahoma and Oklahomans were like. I think he  left them with a real good feeling about it.  Oklahoma could produce a statesman, a true statesman.  Yes, yes. I think they would speak of him in those terms, too. I think a  lot of the senators that he worked with were really amazed that  somebody so quiet and unassuming and a farmer from Oklahoma could  bring forth such powerful thoughts.  And get the job done.  Yes.  Thank you.  -------  -------
