 Gill, and I   m interviewing Elizabeth Rogers. Today is  August 1, 2008. We   re in the home of Elizabeth Rogers. This interview is  being conducted as part of the O-STATE Stories project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Elizabeth, gosh, you   ve got  a long, long decorated history with Oklahoma State University. Can you  tell us a little bit about your early life before Oklahoma State  University?  I was born in Chickasha, Oklahoma on December 21, 1917. I attended  Chickasha public schools and Oklahoma College for Women (OCW).  When I got ready to start to college, we were in the throes of the  Depression and we didn   t have any money. We never felt like we were  poor, we just didn   t have any money. I always knew that I was going go  to college and I was able to get a job, which paid me  20 a month. Board  and room at OCW cost  25 a month. My parents, who had moved away  by this time, had to dig up  5 a month. Fees were very meager at that  particular time. I remember my fees for the first semester at OCW were   18 and that included a fine arts fee because I was a speech major.  I felt that I got a really fine education at OCW. I graduated there in  1939, and I taught school for a year at Frederick, in junior high, but I  really wanted to teach high school. I had an opportunity then to go to  Perry where I had high school work, so I moved to Perry, and that   s  where I met Murl. The summer before I went to Perry, I went to  graduate school at the University of Michigan and had planned to  receive a master   s degree after several summers, but instead I got  married. I thought I   d better strike while the iron was hot   while I had  him in the notion   and so I never did finish my master   s degree.  Elizabeth, can you tell us a little bit about how you met Murl?  Well, Murl was a teacher at Perry High School. He had attended  5  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Oklahoma A M College and graduated in three years, going summer  and winter. In 1940, Mr. Perkey, who was head of the vocational  program at that time in the state of Oklahoma, assigned him to Perry  High School, so I met Murl while we were both teachers at Perry High  School. We weren   t supposed to date, but that didn   t make any  difference. We went ahead and did it anyway.  We   d sneak off to Stillwater and places like that, you know, and Mr.  Sprayberry, the superintendent, never knew what we were doing. All the  kids knew, of course, but he never did know.  So was this the school policy at that time?  It was the school policy. I remember when we went in to tell him at the  end of the year that we were going to get married. He said,    Well, who  are you going to marry?    and we said we were going to marry each  other. He looked quite shocked and then he looked at me and he said,     You know that you can   t teach school in Perry anymore,    because they  had a policy that married women could not teach in the program. They  saved the jobs for the men and unmarried women, so I became a stay-at-home  wife and mother.  Well, this is probably an understatement, Elizabeth, but I   ll ask you  more questions about that later     Oh, all right. (Laughs)  So your relationship to OSU began, of course, with Murl     With Murl   I said I did not attend OSU. I do not have one hour credit  from OSU, but I married it.  Well, just generally, your relationship through the years with OSU     Murl was so wrapped up in Oklahoma State from the very beginning. He  loved it. He was a very good student. He was state president of the FFA  the year that he was a freshman. He was a college debater and very  active in all kinds of activities on campus. He always loved OSU. Of  course, it was A M College at that particular time when he graduated.  Now the Rogers clan, your family, is there a pretty strong OSU  background there? Can you share a little bit about your family?  Murl was one of six boys. His oldest brother was a farmer and never did  go to college. The other boys all graduated with their bachelors degrees  from Central State, and two of the boys had master   s degrees from OSU,  6  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Charles Rogers, who later lived in Pawhuska, and Melvin Rogers. Well,   Charles  was superintendent of a lot of schools in Osage County but  finally ended up with a tire and supply store in Pawhuska, but he held a  master   s degree from Oklahoma State. Murl   s brother, Melvin, had a  master   s degree in history from Oklahoma State. The older boys weren   t  that carried away with Oklahoma State as much as Murl was, of course.  And what about your family? Your kids?  My children   I have five children, and all five are graduates of  Oklahoma State. Seven of my nine grandchildren are graduates of  Oklahoma State. Paul   s boys came back from California to attend  Oklahoma State. Jessica, Philip   s daughter, is a graduate of the  University of Illinois, and Mark, Ruth Ann   s second son, attended a  university in San Diego and also the University of Colorado, but never  did graduate.  Well, Elizabeth, through your participation in the Alumni Association  through the years, especially class reunions, you met many of the early  graduates of Oklahoma State University. Could you tell us a little bit  about some of your memories?  Yes, I   d like to tell you about that. Murl moved to Stillwater in March of  1955. He had been selected by a board, first by a committee of the board  of directors of what was known then as the Former Students Association  of Oklahoma A M College. And I remember two of the men that were  on that committee were Jay Hesser, who now lives in Stillwater and is  still alive, and Ed Roberts who lived in Cushing. I think there were three  other members of that committee. They made a recommendation to the  board and it was narrowed down to three candidates, Jack Boyd and  John Conner. They were all three very good candidates, and they were  interviewed by the whole board and Murl was selected. He came to  Stillwater in March and lived in Bennett Hall. He did not move the  family here until May because John and Ruth Ann were both in school  and we thought it was better for them to finish the school year. He had  rented a house that John Hamilton, who was head of the print shop, had  lived in down on Duncan Street and we moved in there in May. The first  thing that happened to me was I was plunged into class reunions.  The Half Century Club met every year. The Half Century Club was  made up of all the graduates who had been out of Oklahoma A M  College for 50 years, and they came back every year for the reunion. It  was very important to them. And, I will say this, that I knew somebody  from every graduating class of Oklahoma A M College and OSU. The  first graduating class had six graduates, and Mr. Jarrell, of the first class,  came back that first year in 1955 for that first time that I helped with  7  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  class reunions. And the early classes   I knew Jessie Thatcher Bost, who  was the first woman graduate. She was a lovely woman. I knew the  members of all the classes that came back for class reunions, and  somebody from every one of those early classes came back. And they  came year after year and it was really interesting. It got to the place that  I remember they would want to be the oldest one present. It was very  important. They   d look around when they came, to see who was the  oldest because that was quite a distinction. But they were wonderful  people. Do you want to hear my story about the Class of 1916?  Absolutely, I   d love to.  Well, I remember one year the Class of 1916, of course, was here and  we had a member of that class whose name was Sexhauer. Her last name  was Sexhauer   S-E-X-H-A-U-E-R   that was her maiden name. So  these old graduates often would come several days ahead of time and  they would make a nuisance of themselves coming into the office while  we were trying to get ready. I always had to help, and I was up there  working one day and this old man had come in early. He leaned over the  desk of the head secretary and said,    Do you have a Sexhauer here?    and  the secretary, Betty Hodnett, who was quite a card in her own way, said,     Sex hour   man as busy as we are, we don   t even have time for a coffee  break.    I was there, and it happened. I was very careful not to tell that  story as long as this particular alumna lived, but it made a good story  later on   Yeah, that   s great.  But these were wonderful people and I was happy that I had the  opportunity of knowing all of them.  Elizabeth, these people had strong feelings, didn   t they, for OSU?  Oh, they had very strong feelings. During the    60s when there was so  much terrible unrest, Dr. Winters, who was actually the founder of the  Soil Conservation Service and had served all over the world, was a  wonderful alumnus and had retired in Stillwater, came into Murl   s office  one day and he said that the Half Century Club wanted to pass a  resolution protesting the fact that one of these big protesters was coming  to the campus to make a speech   or had come to the campus to make a  speech. And they wanted to protest the fact that he was allowed to come  to the campus to make a speech. Murl didn   t want to cause any trouble  and he said,    Well, now that   s over and done with, Dr. Winters. Let   s  just let it pass. I don   t think you want to really pass a resolution about  that.    And he finally convinced him. Well, at the big banquet that night  for the Half Century Club, they had about 200 people there. It was a  8  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  large banquet. I think they held it in the Oklahoma Room. But anyway,  Dr. Winters was giving the invocation and he asked the Lord to forgive  the university for allowing this protester to come to the campus to make  a speech. And I thought that Murl and I would absolutely break a split.  We could hardly stand it we got so tickled   but he made his point.  Well, Elizabeth, you have more than half a century of observing alumni  relationships at Oklahoma State University and you alluded to how loyal  those early alumni were. Did you see any change in that over the years?  Well, I think     Do they still feel as strongly about their alma mater as they used to?  For all the time that Murl was here, we were having the reunions. We  gave gold pins to the 50-year people when they came back for their 50-  year anniversary, and we gave silver pins for the 25-years. I   m sure the  classes were smaller in the early days, and it was possible, you know, for  them to know each other. But as the college grew, then it was difficult to  get people together that knew each other and so then it finally was not  continued. But those first years the class reunions were very important     a very important part of the alumni program   very important. And I  don   t know, I think the alumni today are loyal. I think they   re very loyal  to the university   I   m sure they are. But we had so many friends among  the alumni board and they were so dedicated. Murl was so fortunate in  the board members that he had, and I could talk a lot about some of  those early board members who supported him so well during those  early years.  Picking up on your conversations about loyalty and relationships of  alumni at the university, how important do you think the Alumni  Association is and what do you think the role of the Alumni Association  is in connecting the alumni to the university?  Well, I think it   s very important, and we had the cooperation in the  Alumni Association with the presidents of the university. Of course,  when we came here, Dr. Willham was the president. He had succeeded  Dr. Bennett, who was president during Murl   s time as a student. Dr.  Willham had been Murl   s adviser when he enrolled at Oklahoma State,  and Murl had a wonderful relationship with Dr. Willham. He never came  to the Student Union that he didn   t drop by the alumni office; poke his  head in and have something to say. He cooperated in every way.  Murl had a wonderful relationship with the vice presidents and the  deans. In the early years when he went to alumni meetings, he had the  deans as speakers to alumni in various counties, and they would go. He  would take them in his car and they would go to alumni meetings. They  9  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  cooperated. Dr. Kamm went with him often and Gene Swearington went  with him. He had wonderful cooperation from the deans, the vice  presidents and the presidents. When Dr. Kamm became president   I  was president of Lahoma the year that Dr. Kamm became president.  To maybe wrap onto your comments about the presidents, can you give  us sort of personality highlights, how you dealt with Dr. Bennett, on and  on   in particular Willham   your thoughts on different presidents  through the years when you were there and since?  Well, I don   t want to be negative, but Dr. Boger was never in Murl   s  office. All the other presidents he had a wonderful relationship with. I  don   t know whether he just didn   t think the Alumni Association was that  important or what   but anyway, that was true.  Do you have a favorite past president?  No, I was very fond of all of them. They were good friends. When we  first started traveling on our trips, Dr. Willham was very interested and  he gave us a lot of good advice because he   d traveled all over the world.  Told us to take Halazone, some kind of pills to put in our water, you  know, to be sure that we wouldn   t get sick, and gave us very good  advice about it. And I remember we were going around the world and  Mrs. Willham called me and said,    I hope you   re not going to that awful  place,    and I said,    What awful place?    and she said,    Calcutta.     (Laughter) But we didn   t go to Calcutta when we went to India. We had  a wonderful relationship and especially with Dr. Kamm because the year  that I was president of Lahoma, of course, we worked very closely with  Dr. and Mrs. Kamm. We went down to Okmulgee with them and so  forth. Murl always had a wonderful relationship with the presidents and  they seemed to appreciate what the Alumni Association was doing.  I might say this   that the Alumni Association when Murl came was  operating on just a shoestring, and higher education was not well funded  at all. And so he was very interested in trying to get more funding out of  the legislature. Scott Orbison was living in Enid at this particular time,  and he was president of the Alumni Association, and Ralph Ball was  living in Oklahoma City. They were two of the strongest supporters that  Murl had at this particular time. But I remember that Murl decided that  they were going to have to lobby the legislature in order to get more  money for higher education. So Murl would meet Scott. He would drive  west on  Highway- 51 at an intersection over there that went directly  down to Oklahoma City. He would meet Scott and all the way down to  Oklahoma City, Murl would brief Scott on statistics and Scott did the  presentation before the Legislature and then they would come back and  they would do it over and over again. And I do think they had a good  10  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  influence in getting more money.  Then, of course, Murl organized the Higher Education Alumni Council,  and he had great cooperation from the alumni director at OU and also an  alumna from Oklahoma College for Women named Dorothy McGregor.  The three of them actually were the ones that organized the Higher  Education Alumni Council, and it worked to get money for higher  education. That was its purpose   trying to get more money out of the  Legislature for higher education and it was successful. They did increase  the amount of money that was given. Carter Bradley became the  executive director of the Higher Education Alumni Council. He was a  graduate of OU and a really fine man, a news man and had worked in  Washington for UPI. Carter is still living, and if you ever interviewed  Carter, you   d get a lot of information. He lives in Oklahoma City.  Mel Jones was pretty active?  Mel Jones was   oh, yes, Mel was a wonderful help in every way. Mel  and Mary traveled with us on a number of our alumni trips, too. Mary  would be able to tell you a lot now even though Mel probably couldn   t,  but they were very, very active. When Murl retired, Mel called me on  the phone one day and said,    How would you feel if we raised a  President   s Distinguished Scholarship to give Murl upon his  retirement?      give the scholarship in his name. I said,    Oh, Mel. You   ll  never be able to raise  25,000.    He said,    You just watch me. I   m the  best money raiser you ever saw.    I know that he raised over  33,000 for  that scholarship, and they presented it to Murl when he retired.  Mel was always so supportive of the Alumni Association. I could just  mention person after person. I don   t remember that Murl   s board ever  crossed him in anything   in any of his innovative ideas that he came up  with for the Alumni Association. They would take the ball and run with  it. He had wonderful support from his alumni boards all through the 25  years that he served as the alumni director. I can   t say enough about  these men and women, too. I remember women like Virginia Lippert  who was on the board and supported him so well down through the  years. They were wonderful and became some of our very best friends.  Elizabeth, why don   t we pick up on that. Can you highlight some of the  individuals who served as past presidents of the Alumni Association and  some of the things you remember about their personalities and their  contributions to the Association?  Well, yes. As I said, Ralph Ball thought big all the time. Where some of  them worked for very small salaries in their own jobs at this particular  time, Ralph had a lot of money. He was president of HTB   a big  11  Gill  Rogers  architectural firm  HTB Architects, PLLC, 1105-B Spring Street, Silver  Spring, MD 20910 . He thought big and he wanted the alumni  association to think big and he saw to it that Murl got a raise every year.  When we came to OSU, Murl   s salary was  6,000 a year, which we  thought was pretty good since we had made only  4,800 when he was  manager of the Chamber of Commerce in Hugo, but Ralph saw to it that  every year Murl received a raise. He never made over  40,000 a year in  all the 25 years that he served. We lived sort of a hand-to-mouth  existence, but we always made it through.  My problem was getting him to put in for his mileage reports and get his  mileage checks back. Of course they paid him mileage for all the miles  that he drove. I remember when we first came here   well, when he first  came here, even before we moved here   he wanted to meet the alumni,  and so he spent most of his time traveling to different alumni clubs all  over the state. I remember he told me about going to one in west Texas.  He came in March and they had set up this meeting in west Texas, in the  Texas panhandle. I can   t remember what town it was but anyway he  encountered a big snowstorm on the way out there and just barely made  it to the meeting and found out they   d called off the meeting because of  the weather (Laughs) when he got there. But he was very eager to meet  all of the people and that   s what he did during those early days.  You mentioned Ralph Ball     Ralph Ball was one of his main supporters, as I said, and Joe Scott. I  don   t think Joe was ever president of the Alumni Association, but he  was quite wealthy and he was president of a big insurance company in  Oklahoma City; he was one of our most loyal supporters in Oklahoma  City. And then when we started the alumni banquets, first of all for high  school seniors and then they determined that it was better to catch them  while they were juniors, and they started having them for juniors. But  some of our banquets for these honor students were so very important in  getting students to come to Oklahoma State. And Jim Cobb, I remember,  in Oklahoma City was one of our very best workers in the Oklahoma  City club and helped so very much with those banquets. I know my own  daughter-in-law said that she had not even thought of attending  Oklahoma State until she was a guest at one of those banquets. And then  later, after she married Charles, they became big workers in helping set  up those banquets in Oklahoma City. Murl always had good programs.  And I want to tell you one thing that was done in those very early days.  He filmed the Varsity Review, and those films should be on file in the  library. I don   t know whether they are still available or not, but we had  some excellent varsity review programs. I remember one year the Chi  Omegas had a special skit that was very, very good. He filmed these and  12  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  then would take the film out for programs for alumni. Another thing he  did, and these films should be on file in the library, he made films about  the university; he made at least two that I remember. I wrote the script  for the first one and he interviewed various people on the campus and  photographed the homecoming parades and all various activities,  football and sports and all of that, to make people want to come to  Oklahoma State. Those films were very good films and helped with  recruiting students. I think they   re probably still on file, they were for a  long time, in the library.  Elizabeth, you mentioned HEACO (Higher Education Alumni Council  of Oklahoma). Could you mention some other highlights that you  recall   some innovative programs that Murl put in place during his  years?  Well, he started the Foundation, actually. It was called the Alumni  Achievement Fund, and one of the first things they did was to raise  money for scholarships and the Alumni Association had a committee.  The board had a committee appointed to award these scholarships. One  time I happened to be working at the office, which I did. I was part of  the free labor, you know. And I was up there and I was sitting in on this  meeting, although I had no reason to be in there I guess, but they were  reading the letters of application for the scholarships. And I remember  one in particular that came from a girl in Oklahoma City named Toni  Acosta   and Toni Acosta lives in Stillwater now. You should interview  Toni. She had the most wonderful application letter, and she told how  her mother was a widow and took in sewing in order to support her.  Then she told about all the activities that she participated in, in her high  school, and how badly she needed to come to college and so forth. And I  remember one   I believe it was Scott Orbison who said,    I don   t care  who else you give a scholarship to, but that girl is going to get a  scholarship,    and she received one of the early scholarships. You could  interview Toni Acosta Stone. She married a track man named Stone, and  she lives in Stillwater right now. She works as a volunteer at the  hospital. She   s been president of the hospital auxiliary, and she   s a  wonderful young woman.  You said Stone, and I know the name.  Yes, and she received one of those first alumni scholarships.  So, Elizabeth, what we now know as the OSU Foundation today then  really came out of that Alumni Achievement Fund.  It came out of that. It soon grew to the extent that it needed to be a  separate entity. Just as the Alumni Association became too much for Mr.  13  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Martin to handle with the Placement Bureau, the Alumni Achievement  Fund became too much for the Alumni Association director to handle  along with his other duties. And so they decided to make a special entity  of it and call it the Foundation and Robert Irwin became the first director  of the Foundation, and his office was on the other side of the alumni  office there. They shared a receptionist.  So the Alumni Association then started what was known as university  placement and now Career Services, and then also started the OSU  Foundation?  Yes, yes   and then I suppose some of High School and College  Relationship grew out of it, too. There was close cooperation between  the Alumni Association and High School and College Relations. Russell  Conway worked very closely with Murl. I think you worked with  Russell at one time, too. Murl had a wonderful relationship with High  School and College Relations. And then after the Foundation moved  away from the alumni office the Placement Bureau moved into that  office. Murl had a wonderful relationship with the people there, too.  Elizabeth, I know you have some great travel stories. The travel  program was one of the innovative programs he started, wasn   t it?  Yes. Our first trip to Europe was in 1962. And I remember that he came  home one day and I was fixing dinner, and he came in the kitchen and  said,    We   re going to Europe this summer.    I thought he was crazy. I  didn   t even answer him. We were having a hard time making it from one  paycheck to the other, and the idea of going to Europe was just  impossible. And I said,    It   s almost time for supper,    and he said,    No.  I   m serious. We   re going to Europe this summer,    and I said,    Go get  the kids.    I didn   t even answer him. So after supper, we sat down here at  the dining room table and he explained to me that other alumni  associations in the Big Eight were taking their alumni on international  trips. And we were going to do it, too. He was going to organize it, and  we would get our trips paid for by organizing the trip and leading the  trip. So then I became enthusiastic about it, of course.  Philip was only five years old. Ruth Ann was twenty. And we were  going to go to Europe for three weeks. We had a chartered airplane.  Arlie Nixon, who was an OSU graduate, was the pilot, he worked for  TWA, so we chartered an airplane from TWA. We were the last  propeller-driven airplane that crossed the Atlantic for TWA. And, of  course, it took a lot longer in a propeller airplane. We charged  750 for  three weeks in Europe, three meals a day, hotels, all of the arrangements.  And naturally a whole lot of people wanted to go. Some 85 people, I  think, signed up, ten of whom just wanted to ride over to Europe and  14  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  back with us and then they would go their own way. I know Al Darlow  took his whole family, and he was one that didn   t go all the way around  with us but met us back in Paris to come home together. But they were  standing in line to get on that airplane to go, and it was a wonderful trip.  We flew, of course, to England   well we stopped in Ireland, I  remember, for fuel and then (Laughs) went on over into England, and  then we went into Holland and Germany and Italy and France. It was a  wonderful trip.  We went the places that Murl particularly wanted to go. (Laughs) That   s  where we always went. Once in awhile we had people that asked us to  go certain places, and he would incorporate that in the trip. Like the time  we went to the Galapagos Islands because Mary Louise Higgins  particularly wanted to go to the Galapagos Islands, and I   m so glad we  included it in our trip to South America. And we went to Israel the  second time because Bob Allee missed the trip the first time and wanted  to go to Israel, so we went to Israel the second time. But we had many  people that went on all of our alumni trips. We became an alumni family  in a way.  Elizabeth, was the infamous train incident with Murl in Germany? Was  that on that first trip or was that a later trip?  That was the first trip. Well, it happened in this way. We had been in  Italy and the train went on around into France and on that particular trip  between Italy and Nice, France, one of the alums came up to Murl and  said,    There   s no water in the bathroom on the train.    They found that  out as soon as the train started. So he confronted the conductor about  getting water on the train, and that was what the problem was about.  And the French are very volatile people. Anyway, when they got to  France, the argument ensued and I don   t remember just what happened  but it was over water on the train.  We had two German guides that were going with us on all of the trip     Gerhardt and Renata, a man and a woman. Gerhardt was trying to argue  with the man, too, over the water on the train. That was the incident and  they put Murl off the train at Nice and also Gerhardt. Gerhardt and Murl,  they were put off the train. Well, we had a lady on our trip, Mrs.  Afanasiev, Eugenia Afanasiev, whose husband had been a faculty  member here. They were originally from Russia, she and her first  husband had fled from Russia and her husband was killed during the  Russian Revolution and   anyway they were White Russians.  So Murl was put off the train?  So Murl was put off the train. Then the conductor wanted the tickets,  15  Gill  and Eugenia, who spoke very fluent French, went up to him and said,     You put the man off the train that had the tickets. You knew they had  the tickets, and you put them off the train.    So we were on our way to  Paris, and they let us eat in the dining car and they knew we had the  tickets. They knew that we were legitimate but I had no idea what had  happened to Murl or what was going to happen to him because they took  him. They had two gendarmes with automatic weapons behind him. The  last I saw, they were going down the railroad track toward the station  with two gendarmes with machine guns pointing at their backs and we  were on our way to Paris. So I was kind of upset, naturally, about what  the situation was going to be. So all the way to Paris, and it took several  hours on the train, I wondered what on earth was gonna happen.  A funny thing happened. Dorothy Dabney was awfully upset about it.  She was from Vernon, Texas, and she was traveling with her two girls  and her husband didn   t go. She was ready to call her husband in Vernon,  Texas to see if he couldn   t do something about this. She said,    Oh, what  do you think is going to happen to Murl?    And Pug Griffin said,    Oh,  they   ll just probably put him in jail or send him off to the foreign  legion.    (Laughs) He always had a joke for everything, but anyway  when we landed in Paris, the first thing I saw was Murl. And this is the  only time that he had traveled on this trip that he didn   t wear a white  shirt with a necktie. There he stood in a sport shirt with the funniest  looking necktie on I ever saw in my life and I got off the train and I  remember saying,    Where did you get that necktie?    instead of saying,     Oh, what happened to you? How wonderful it is to see you     (Laughs)  I remember Juanita Knoll, who was head of Clothing, Textiles and  Merchandising, who was traveling with us at the time said,    Well, why  didn   t you run up to him and throw your arms around his neck and tell  him how glad you were to see him? (Laughs) You said,    Where did you  get that necktie?       They wouldn   t let him on the airplane to fly to Paris  without a necktie, and that was why he had on that funny looking one.  But he said when they got in to the railroad station, when the gendarmes  took him in to the railroad station he explained the whole situation. They  apologized to him and saw that he got on an airplane and met us in Paris.  So that was what happened. They apologized. They said it was an Italian  train and therefore the French didn   t have anything to do with it, you  know, and so forth. That was the story, and there wasn   t anything bad  that happened.  Well, there   s dozens of Murl Rogers stories and Murl was so  synonymous with the Alumni Association and Oklahoma State University  to thousands and thousands of alumni. If you could, tell us a little bit of  your perspective on Murl   s role in the Alumni Association, what kind of  person Murl was   his personality.  16  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Well, he loved his work. I think he was really made for it   I don   t  know   at least that   s what Ira Armstrong told him when he told him he  should apply for the job. He said,    This job was just made for you. You  need to       Murl loved people to begin with. He liked to work with  people and he had an ability of being able to work with people. And  from the time he started working with the alumni, he loved the alumni.  He looked forward every morning to going to work. He was at his desk  at 8:00 every morning no matter what county he was in the night before.  He always made it back so that he could be at his desk and ready to go  the next day. He looked forward to every day that he worked in the  Alumni Association.  He just really thrived on it, and he was always trying to think of new  ways that he could serve the Alumni Association. He always looked  upon himself not as a leader but more as one that was serving. He tried  to put his presidents forward, always. He had so many fine men,  particularly, that were president. I think during his tenure, they were all  men. I don   t remember any women that served. There were many  women on the board, but I don   t remember any that served as president.  But they were all such fine people and easy to work with and very  supportive of all of his ideas when he would come up with something  (Laughs) that he wanted to see. He established the Hall of Fame, for  instance, that was another thing that was established.  I understand he started the Top Ten Graduating Seniors Award     Yes, we honored the top ten graduating seniors. We honored the top  teachers, then honored the top graduate assistants. Did all of that. That  was very important. All of those things were done. Did we talk about the  train trips that we took?  Let   s just go into that. Your relationships with the Athletic Department,  of course, and the alumni was very close and     Very close.  There were many stories there. Could you share some of those  activities?  Well in the beginning we went to Arkansas every year, to Little Rock.  As far as the University of Arkansas was concerned, they considered a  game played in Little Rock as an away game, if it wasn   t played in  Fayetteville. So every year we had to go to Little Rock for the football  game. I remember the first year we had a black player on our team,  Chester Pittman. Cliff Spiegel was the coach and the hotels in Little  Rock were not going to allow Chester to stay in the hotel with the team.  17  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Cliff bowed his neck and stood his ground, and he said,    Chester is  going to stay with the team or we will not stay in your hotel.    The only  hotel that would allow Chester to stay in with the team was the old  Lafayette Hotel, and so the alumni stayed there, too   and it was a very  good relationship. Then the same company built the Camelot Inn and  then we moved to the Camelot Inn. But the alumni always stayed where  the team stayed.  Clay Potts always had a barbeque for the alumni on the Arkansas State  Fairgrounds which was near War Memorial Stadium. The night before  the game, we had a big barbeque with Clay Potts there, and the alumni  came to that. We always took a group of alumni every year that we went  to Arkansas. We had an alumni group that went to Arkansas. I remember  one really interesting story. When we had moved to the Camelot, the  boy who later became the coach there at the University of Arkansas     what   s his name? That just left     Terry Don Phillips?  No, I mean the coach at Arkansas, the football coach that just left the  University of Arkansas to go to Mississippi.  Houston Nutt started at the  University of Mississippi in November 2007.  His father played  basketball for Mr. Iba. Well Houston Nutt, Sr. was completely deaf, but  he played basketball for Mr. Iba. We were there at the Camelot and  Houston Nutt, Jr. was playing football for the University of Arkansas.  He was on the team as a freshman and Houston, Sr. came up to Murl and  said   he could communicate, he could read lips, and we could  communicate with Houston, Sr. just fine as long as he could see our  faces. He said to Murl,    Come in to the coffee shop. I need to talk to  you.    So Murl and I went into the coffee shop and Houston, Sr. said,     Houston is unhappy at the University of Arkansas and he wants to  transfer to Oklahoma State. Would you speak to the coaches and tell  them that Houston wants to transfer?    So Murl said,    Well, yes. I   d be  real glad to talk to the coaches. I have a really good relationship with the  coaches.    And so he did and we didn   t think anymore about it and the  first thing we knew Houston Nutt, Jr. was at Oklahoma State and  became the quarterback for Oklahoma State. That grew out of that time  that we were there. It probably would have happened anyway, but that   s  a story that happened there.  Elizabeth, we   re talking about Alumni Association activities around  athletic events and you were telling us some stories about Arkansas and  then maybe mention a little bit about some of your other travels.  We always tried to take about two alumni to about two out-of-state  football games. I remember one of the early games that we went to was  18  in Denver when we played the University of Denver. We took all of our  children that particular time, which was very unusual. Then later, we  went to various other colleges. I remember one year we went to the  University of Nebraska, and it was terribly cold. We had to stay in  Omaha because there was no way we could get rooms for our alumni in  Lincoln because of the support that the University of Nebraska has with  Nebraska alumni. So we stayed in Omaha and had to bus to Lincoln. All  the buses had already been signed up for Nebraska friends and  supporters, and we had to ride the    awfulest    old rickety school bus  from Omaha to Lincoln and our seats were not particularly good. They  weren   t in the end zone, but they were almost in the end zone and they  were very low.  We had our band there. Charles was in the band that year, I remember,  and he went with the band. One thing I particularly remember was that  sea of red, of course, in the stadium. We were close to the end zone and  the bleachers were built pretty high and underneath the bleachers was  this hog wire stretched across the underneath the bleachers. People had  paid to stand under there to watch the game, and that made a terrible  impression (Laughs) on me in that cold   it was sleeting and the weather  was just terrible. And of course we got beat. But I remember how nice  the Nebraska fans were to us. We were always well-treated by Nebraska  fans whether they came to Stillwater or whether they were there in  Lincoln. I liked the Nebraska fans. They were good people.  But you wanted to know about some of our other trips. Our football  trains were two very distinctive times. Our first football train was to the  Astrodome in Houston. The Astrodome was new. Everybody wanted to  go to the Astrodome. We had 868 people on the football train and that  year Murl and I did not go to Arkansas. We sent Leo Elwell, who was  Murl   s associate, with the group that went to Arkansas because Murl and  I were making packets at the office to give to each one of those 868  people that were going to be on the train. Each packet contained his  football tickets, his train ticket, his hotel reservation, the number of the  bus that he was going to ride when the buses met us at Houston, and  other information. We had to fix all of that ready to go for the next week  and so we did not get to go to Arkansas.  Well that year, of course, we won big at Arkansas, and I remember that  the alumni who were on the trip bought Murl a hog that was a large hog  on its side   razorback   with a whole bunch of little pigs and on the hog  they had printed the score. I still have that hog and those little pigs that  were brought to us because we won that particular year in Arkansas. But  we didn   t get to see it because we were filling the seats for the football  train. And then we went to Austin another time, and that was when Walt  McGarrison was playing, and I believe that he made the only touchdown  19  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  for us in that game. But Walt was a very good player and we all enjoyed  watching him play.  Sure did.  But we always tried to take alumni on usually regularly-scheduled  airlines, and we would reserve a block of seats. I know we went to  Colorado several times. And sometimes we   d bus from Denver to  Boulder and we   d have box lunches and everything on the buses for  them and so forth. But our trips to Colorado were always a lot of fun and  we went to many other places, too.  Getting back to the earlier part of our conversation, in my years in the  Alumni Association, we had the Murl Rogers Award, and that   s for  someone who really went above and beyond and worked a whole lot of  hours. Murl was always legendary in the way he worked   his work ethic  and hours. Can you share a little bit about how he worked   some of the  nights he   d be in till 2:00 in the morning and be back in the office at  8:00? I mean, just some of the characteristics about Murl.  Well, he was   as you say, he was a hard worker and he expected  everybody that worked for him to be a hard worker. His men that he  hired, with the exception of the first one and who did not last very long,  were good workers. He started out by himself in the office. The office  was in the north end of the original Student Union. Then when the wing  was built on, of course the office moved. But in that first office, the  north end of the office was occupied by the Alumni Association offices  and the south end was occupied by the Placement Bureau with Mr.  Martin, and then there was a work area in the middle. I remember it was  known in those first days, before the name was changed, as the Former  Students Association. They had a tall desk when you first went in the  door where alumni who visited the office could sign their names and it  said,    In books of fame where you   ll write your name, OAMC    and they  would sign their names when they came into the office.  I remember one of the secretaries that he inherited from Mr. Martin was  Nadine Powell, and she was a real fine lady who worked there in that  office. His secretaries were expected to be hard workers, and if they  didn   t work very hard, they didn   t last very long. I remember he fired  one   well actually she quit. (Laughs) One lady that was working for  him, and he came in and found out that she had a whole drawer full of  checks that she hadn   t processed. It had accumulated over a long period  of time and people were beginning to wonder why they were not  receiving their magazine and all the other attributes (Laughs) that they  were supposed to be getting. And so he scolded her for it and said,     You   ve got to stay here until you process these checks,    and she just  20  Gill  Rogers  picked up her purse and walked out. (Laughs) But most of his secretaries  knew that they had to be hard workers and they were.  All of the men, with the exception of the first one, were that kind of  worker, too. He had some wonderful associates. Leo Elwell was his first  one, and he stayed with him until he became head of Central Mailing.  Murl had told them they couldn   t have his mailing if they didn   t hire Leo  to do it because Leo knew more about mailing than anybody because the  Alumni Association sent out more letters than anybody. But anyway,  Leo was excellent and Ray Sharp worked for Murl for 13 years. Bob  Roth was excellent and Steve Moody. All of those men were really good  workers. As far as the alumni banquets are concerned, Murl went to all  of them. He never missed going to the honors banquets for the students.  He went to all of them, and he had two associates at that time, and each  one of those would go to half of them. But he went to all of them.  And he had been at those honors banquets and the chapters meetings     he would many times come back in at midnight or after and he   d be at  work at 8:00  A.M. .  He   d be at his desk at 8:00   and probably it wasn   t very good for his  health but cardiovascular problems ran in his mother   s family. And of  course he had a massive heart attack in 1974 and his brother had died in     73 of a massive heart attack. All of his brothers had heart problems; it  just ran in the family. And all of his cousins did   but he recovered. He  was 23 days in the hospital, fretting all the time because he was not at  his desk at the Alumni Association. He recovered and then during the  three years between the heart attack and open heart surgery, occasionally  he would have chest pains and Sam Earnest would slap him in the  hospital. And I remember one time we were getting ready for class  reunions, and he told Sam he could not go to the hospital because he had  class reunions and Sam said,    You will go to the hospital     And he had  me take to the hospital his pen and ink and some parchment paper so  that he could letter the deceased members of the Half Century Club for  the past year.  And how we happened to have that on display every year is an  interesting story. Dean McElroy   who had been Dean of Veterinary  Medicine and I think several other things for the university and for  which McElroy Avenue is named now. Dean McElroy came to Murl one  day and he said,    We are not going to have any more of these sad times  when we have a little ceremony for the people who have died during the  year.    He said,    I can   t stand it. We   re gonna have to do something  else,    and so Murl devised the idea of having a scroll with all the names  of the Half Century Club who had died during the year. He put it on  display in the Chinese Lounge and put potted plants all around it in a  21  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  very attractive display where they could go to it and look and see who  had died   whose name was on the scroll. But then Dean McElroy was  satisfied that they didn   t have a ceremony (Laughs) about the deceased.  Now legend has it Murl was a stickler for details. In your honors  banquets, you remember the Pistol Petes   the table tents he used to put  up there? Did you help with the set up of many of those honors  banquets?  Oh, yes.  Can you tell us about how particular he was about exactly how the Petes  had to be in a row and those kinds of things?  Oh, they had to be turned the same way toward the center of each table.  He would go around and be sure that the decorations were absolutely the  way they ought to be. Oh, yes, he was very particular about that. And he  was very particular about the programs that he took out and made them  so that the students would really want to come, who were attending, that   they  would really want to come to Oklahoma State. He had really good  speakers and good films that he showed them and everything to make it  very attractive for the students to want to come to Oklahoma State.  Murl was pretty innovative and very creative, the programs that he did  and the honors banquets were one of those. Elizabeth, so people  understand, give us a broad picture. They were doing, how many, fifty-some-  odd or more of those?  Well, they   yes probably. He probably had over 50 during his last  years, in various counties. There were 77 counties and sometimes  counties combined, two counties that were close together. One of the  first counties that had honors banquets was Kay County. Ponca City was  one of the early ones I remember. And then it grew and it grew and each  county   and they worked with the leadership in the counties. And one  thing that he did, he always wanted to be sure that they had a good  public address system, that people would be able to hear. Sometimes  he   d go into counties for meetings where it didn   t want to work, so he  always carried in the back of the car a portable public address system  that ran on batteries that he could hook up so that people could hear.  That was very important. He had this idea that a banquet shouldn   t last  over two hours. He didn   t want people to get too tired and he wanted  them to start on time, have the meal on time, have an hour   s program  and then go home. He was a great stickler about that and the idea of     stand up, speak up and shut up    (Laughs) was part of his belief, really.  Now, the county chapters helping sponsor these locally give  22  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  scholarships, did they not?  Yes, they did. When they first started that, they tried to work it out so  that alumni would pick up the student and take the students to the  banquet to involve the alumni with these students. And I don   t know  whether they continued that all the time, but they did that at the very  first. I went to a lot of those and helped set up a lot of them, particularly  in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, in some of the large ones. I didn   t try to go  to all of them, of course.  Some of those in Oklahoma City and Tulsa were several hundred people.  Yes, we had very large banquets in Oklahoma City and Tulsa because  they involved so many high schools, so I always helped with that. He  would take people out of his office to help set up, you know, in addition  to the local alumni. But the local alumni were always very deeply  involved in all of these banquets, and they were proud of them. They  were really proud and then they were proud when they found these  students were signing up to go to Oklahoma State. I really believe that  all those banquets helped increase our enrollment at Oklahoma State. I  think there   s no question about it because our enrollment really  increased during the time that these banquets were really going strong.  Changing the subject, you must have many special memories of  Oklahoma State University. Could you share some of your highlights  and your personal memories about Oklahoma State?  Well, as I said, I became quite close to the alumni. I always hosted the  wives of board members. Sometimes we took trips. I remember one time  I had arranged for a bus to take us to Woolaroc, to take the wives to  Woolaroc while the men were having the board meetings. And of course  there were some women on the board at that time, too. I remember one  time I arranged for Brian Thompson to take us around and show us the  landscaping on the campus. He encouraged the people, I know, to pick  up acorns from the pin oak trees and he told them they could just stick  that acorn in the ground and that acorn would grow into a pin oak, I  remember. He was the landscape person, and the campus was always  beautiful during the time that we had the alumni meetings in the spring.  It was always beautiful. But I became very close to all of the alumni.  I had open house after all the football games here in my house, and I  never knew how many people were going to come by, and I fed them a  meal. I worked and prepared. I had casseroles. I had chicken tetrazzini. I  had various things. I never knew how many people were going to come  to my house after the game, and often alumni would come after the  game   drop by. And sometimes they   d bring their friends   people that  23  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  I didn   t even know, but Murl and I always had open house and we  welcomed people. I stopped that after Murl retired and just had it here  for family, but I quit cooking. (Laughs) But I spent the day before  getting ready for open house after all the games and they enjoyed  coming to our house. We never served anything alcoholic, even the  drinkers knew that when they came to my house they were gonna get  cokes or lemonade or something like that because Murl was quite a  stickler on being opposed to alcohol. So we never offered them that, but  they didn   t expect it. They respected his feelings on the subject and he  never served alcohol at any of his meetings.  Elizabeth, how do you feel about recent activities or current activities     the things that are going on at the campus     Well I   m not very close to what   s going on at the campus. I rarely go to  the campus except for athletic events anymore, so I really don   t know  too much about what   s going on. Of course I have a student, always,  with our presidential scholarship and that has grown from the  33,000  now to over  100,000   that fund has   with the investments and so  forth. And eventually maybe I   ll be able to support two students, but it  just keeps growing and I always meet with my student sometime. The  Foundation always sees that I meet with my student sometime during the  year and that   s been a very fine thing.  I just don   t make it to the campus. I still buy football, basketball and  baseball tickets. I still go to games even though I don   t see very well  anymore. When I go to basketball and football, I take a radio with  earphones so that I know exactly what   s going on because I can   t see  that well. But it   s wonderful to be with the crowd and be with the group  and I still feel a part of it. As I said, I feel that I married it. I   m proud of  the university, and I feel that it   s doing well and I have a great interest in  it still, certainly, and always will. I was able to attend the Centennial  meeting of my own college this year   their 100th anniversary   and that  was interesting. I was glad to be there for that but I really feel quite a  part, still, of this university and I have a great interest in it, still.  Elizabeth   gosh, let   s see   Murl was the longest-serving alumni  director     Yes, if you   d have stayed two more years, you would have caught up  with him. (Laughs)  Well I almost did and then, of course, the Alumni Director, A. O. Martin,  Archie O. Martin, before Murl was 23 years I think   23-1/2?  I don   t know how long Mr. Martin was, but I will say this for the  24  Gill  Rogers  Martins   they were absolutely wonderful to us when we came to  Stillwater. Mrs. Martin took me under her wing. I never belonged to  Newcomers because Mrs. Martin took me to Lahoma. She took me to  her bridge club. She took me to her book club. She introduced me all  around the town, and I remember one time she introduced me as the wife  of the alumni director and this woman turned to me and she said,    Yes,  but what does your husband do for a living?    (Laughter) And I was so  shocked because he was working at least 18 hours a day. I said,    Well  that   s what he does for a living. That   s a full-time job.     Did they ever ask you,    What does he do in the summer?    (Laughter)  Well, in the summer, of course every two years after 1962, we were  traveling with the alumni. We not only went on international tours, we  were on all the continents except Antarctica. We had extensive trips  around the world. We had a trip to South America. We were on the  South American continent twice. Then we also took cruises   took  groups on cruises   and we went on many cruises. Our first cruise was a  Big Eight cruise where the Big Eight directors were invited to go, and  that was interesting because we were on the ship with all the other Big  Eight directors. Murl had a very good relationship with the other Big  Eight directors.  When we first came here, he had an excellent relationship with the  director at OU and that was why he was able to work with him so well in  the organization of the alumni council. He was a very fine director and  as I said, Mr. Vineyard, too, he was president of one of the colleges, and  he was real active in the organization of that, too. But our international  trips were absolutely wonderful. Murl took bids for them, and he was  able to get really good prices. Our first trip as I told you, the first trip  was  750. That was a chartered airplane. Then we went around the  world, and that first trip was  1,995 for 30 days around the world. And  we stayed in Hilton Hotels every place there was a Hilton   wonderful  hotels   beautiful hotels. And three meals a day and that was really  great. Where there was not a Hilton Hotel, we stayed in the finest hotels  that were available.  He told me one time, he said,    I   ve taken you to some of the finest hotels  in the world,    and I said,    Yes, and to some of the worst ones, too.     (Laughs) I remember one that we stayed at in Cambodia out at Siem  Reap just outside of Angkor Wat that was a terrible, low-class by  American standards, motel. I remember the bathtub didn   t have a  stopper, and all kinds of big insects came up through the drain (Laughs)  but it was worth it to get to go to Angkor Wat. And Cambodia had only  two airplanes at that time and we flew into Cambodia in those airplanes.  They were small airplanes, but then the government confiscated them  25  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  while we were there and we were stranded. We didn   t know how we  were gonna get out. We did not have diplomatic relations with  Cambodia, the United States did not at that particular time. The war at  Vietnam was going on. We could even see the flashes of the guns from  Cambodia. The Cambodian people are wonderful people, nice, gentle,  wonderful people. Fortunately Mrs. Kennedy had been there shortly  before we were there, and they were all talking about Mrs. Kennedy  every place we went.    Mrs. Kennedy, she speak very fine French.   And  they did everything they could, and they got us on Malaysian Airlines  and we got out of Cambodia into Singapore a day early.  We had some interesting experiences along the way   but it all worked  out     it all worked out. I remember one time the company that we were  dealing with on our trip around the world wasn   t gonna let us check into  a hotel because the travel company had not paid the bill for the previous  tour. But anyway, it all worked out and we got in without any trouble.  Murl was a pretty good talker, and he was able to see that it was done  and they honored our vouchers and we were able to check in. And I  remember one time they took some of our bags   our bags went on out  to the Mena House at the Pyramids in Egypt instead of being at our hotel  in Cairo, and some of our people did without their bags that night, but  they came in the next morning. But we never lost any bags and we never  lost any passengers, and everything was fine. We never had any real  difficulties on any of our trips, and people seemed to enjoy them and  have a wonderful time. I wouldn   t take anything for having been a part  of those alumni trips.  Elizabeth, a quarter of century of service to Oklahoma State  University   how would you hope people remember the Murl and  Elizabeth Rogers era at Oklahoma State University?  So many of the ones that we knew and that worked with us are gone. I  want to give you a list of some of the survivors that are still alive that  could tell you about some of those years. Dean Stringer in Oklahoma  City was one, Murl knew him from the time that he was a student. Ken  Mitchell over in Logan County and those are two that I think of. I think  of so many prominent people like Pete Bartlett that worked so much  with the alumni association, and I think his sons are still active     Yeah.     and you   re now seeing the second generations of a lot of these people  that worked with Murl and, of course, Mel and Mary Jones were very  outstanding. Glenn Yahn just recently died. Glen was a wonderful  emcee at any kind of banquet. He was just funny. He was clever, and it  looked like he was just shooting off the hip but he had prepared it very  26  Gill  Rogers  carefully. Scott Orbison was, as I said, important   very important in the  Alumni Association from the time he was in Enid and later when he was  in Tulsa. And Frederick Drummond, you could meet with Frederick  Drummond now. Frederick was always very supportive and such a fine  person, and he was descended from Gentner Drummond, who was on  the Board of Regents when we first came here. We knew so many of the  Regents, too. Murl worked very closely with a lot of the Regents, and  we were in the homes of a lot of the Regents from time to time. He had a  very close association with Regents as well as alumni board members.  So, again, as you always do, you   re casting credit to others   but how  about Elizabeth and Murl Rogers   how do you want them to be  remembered? How do you want to be remembered?  Well, I hope they will remember Murl as one who loved his work. He  loved Oklahoma State University. I said he had three loves   his family,  his church and Oklahoma State University and it would be hard to know  which he put first. (Laughter) Sometimes I felt like he was putting the  university first, but I went along with him   whatever he wanted to do     and I tried to help him in every way and be supportive and our children  understood that. They knew that he was going be gone a lot, and they  accepted it. In fact, he involved our whole family. He   d have all of the  ones that were old enough up at the office stuffing letters at night   how  many times we did that   sometimes he   d bring home great big boxes of  envelopes, and we   d sit in the living room and stuff letters. He involved  the whole family. Actually, we were all a part of the Alumni  Association. It was understood. (Laughs) It was our life. It was just  absolutely our life, and so I think most of the alums who knew us will  remember us fondly because we tried to know the alumni, and we liked  them personally. We really liked them.  Murl did so many things that other people might hire other people to do.  He was a very good artist. He did his own lettering. He made his own  signs, and they looked professional because he was a very good artist.  He had so much ability in so many ways, and he wasn   t afraid to work.  He didn   t seek credit for himself. He always wanted to put his presidents  and his leadership forward. It was his hope to remain in the background.  But I think most of them knew who was really doing most of the work  and they appreciated him. As I said, I don   t remember his ever having  any controversy with any of his board members or any people that he  worked with. He seemed to like them and I think they liked him and as I  said, he had a good relationship with the presidents and with the deans  and the vice presidents always.  I hope that his legacy will stand for many years   and certainly a lot of  what the Alumni Association is doing today is what he established; is  27  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  what he brought into being. And he was not seeking credit for it, but he  was just looking for something that would be good for the university and  for the alumni. And he felt that alumni were important, and he always  felt that the Alumni Association should stand alone and be strong from  now until eternity as far as he was concerned. He believed in it from the  very beginning and loved it every day that he worked for the Alumni  Association and even until the day he died. Until he died in March of  1989, he was still attending all the sporting events, even the ones that he  had to go in his mobile cart, that he rode to football games and to  baseball games. He was still climbing the stairs to go to the upper decks  of the field house the week before he was stricken the last time. He  never gave up     never gave up   always felt a part of OSU and loved it     til the day he died.  Part of the rest of the story is how the Alumni Association felt about  Murl   he was the first ever person designated as a Life Member of the  Board of Directors of the Alumni Association when he retired      Really?     and he attended the meetings regularly and faithfully   every one.  When I came on board in    85, he was there and for those four years  there all the time    I thought that was very fitting they made him a life  member.  Well that was wonderful, and I appreciated the fact that I was given a  life membership to the Alumni Association even though I did not have  one hour of credit from Oklahoma A M or from OSU. But as I said, I  always felt that I married it. It was a part of my life. It still is, and it  always will be. I have loved living in Stillwater. It came to us at a  wonderful time. We knew that we had all these children to send to  college, and certainly they took advantage of the opportunity. They  always knew where they were going to college. I remember he told Ruth  Ann when she graduated from high school that she could go any place  she wanted to, but if she wanted to eat, she   d go to Oklahoma State  University. (Laughs) And that stood for all of them and I remember  when he told Charles that he thought he should go to the University of  Oklahoma for his law degree   that surprised a lot of people. He said,    If  you   re going to practice law in Oklahoma, I think you need to go to  OU,    and he did   but he still has orange blood. It never turned red while  he was down there. (Laughs)  Talk about tradition. You mentioned that Paul was on the board of  directors of the Alumni Association and he was on the executive  committee, one of seven members of the executive committee     28  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Yes.     very, very engaged and involved in the Alumni Association and  Oklahoma State University for many, many years.  Yes, and he would be now if he weren   t in California I guess. It   s just a  long-distance operation but he still holds basketball tickets and football  tickets even though he doesn   t get to come to very many games. All of  our children are very supportive of Oklahoma State and keep up with all  of the activities, even those that don   t live here. They follow the football  and basketball and sporting programs. Everything that goes on here,  they   re very interested and it   s a family tradition. It   s a part of our  family.  Elizabeth, it   s been wonderful. Is there anything we left out or anything  you can think of that you   d like to share with us to   someone may be  viewing this five or ten or twenty years from now   something you want  to say that I forgot to ask or didn   t ask?  Well, I made a list of some of the people that you might want to talk  to     Did Murl know Mr. Iba very well?  Mr. Iba was wonderful. Mr. Iba was a gentleman. He was the nicest  man. Every time he   d meet me, he was so courteous and interested and  nice. I had a lot of respect for Mr. Iba and Murl did, too. And as I said,  we went to basketball, and we went to some out-of-town games,  especially OU. I remember we went down when Eddie and Mel Wright  were playing and Roy Carberry were playing in that old box of a gym  down at OU and we beat them. I think Eddie got 36 points that night.  Even in the time when they didn   t have high scores, it was wonderful. It  was more fun. You can   t imagine. I remember we saw Oscar Robertson   University of Cincinnati player and NBA Hall of Famer  play when he  came to the campus. We were in the Missouri Valley Conference   Cincinnati and OSU were members of the Missouri Valley Conference  at the time.  when we came, and he was the prettiest basketball player I  think I ever saw. He was so graceful on the court, and when he   d go to  hit a free throw, he   d put his hands up over his head and go  gesture  and  it   d go in. But we won and then Wilt Chamberlain  University of Kansas  player and NBA Hall of Famer  came, and Murl gave our tickets to  some alumnus that didn   t have tickets. I was so mad at him, and I didn   t  get to see Wilt   but we won. Mel Wright had the final basket.  He gave away the tickets to that game?  29  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  He gave away our tickets to an alumnus. He set up in the college  auditorium   TVs all over the college auditorium for people that  couldn   t get in the field house. He and I went over there and watched the  basketball game because he   d given our tickets away (Laughter) to some  alumnus. It took me awhile to get over that. He had the film of that and  he took it everywhere for programs, you know, because everybody  wanted to see that basketball game. The California alumni wanted to see  it. We had a club out in the Los Angeles area. He mailed that film to  them so they could have it for their program, and when it came back, the  final basket, Mel Wright   s basket that won the game, had been clipped  from that film. Just absolutely ruined it. I know one day Robert Allen  was talking on his show wondering if a film was available for that game,  and I called him. That   s the only time I ever called Robert Allen on the  show and I said,    I know what happened to one of those films that we  had    and told him about what happened. Some alumnus clipped that out  of the film.  But I remember he had a meeting in Houston one time and he was  showing a film. I don   t remember what film it was. He got on the  airplane and he carried on to the plane his projector and his film, but he  checked his bag. When he got to Houston his bag had gone on to  Panama and he was without a suitcase so he went up to his room. Well  first, he went to the hotel drugstore and he bought deodorant and he  bought toothpaste and a razor and shaving cream and a whole bunch of  stuff. Then he went up to his room and he took off all of his clothes and  he sprayed all of his underwear and everything with the deodorant  (Laughter) and took a shower and put it back on and went to his  meeting. And when he shaved the next morning, he was used to an  electric razor, he cut himself several times with the razor. When he got  off the plane he had cuts on his face and I said,    What in the world  happened to you?    (Laughs) and he told me what happened to him. Well  the bag finally showed up in Stillwater. It came back. He got it back, but  that was funny. It was really funny.  Elizabeth, anything else we missed? It   s been great, I   ve enjoyed it.  Anything else that you can think of before we close?  Well, I told you about all the travels and all the things. He was robbed  one time. The alumni office was robbed when it was in the old office  there before we moved into the office that you were familiar with, when  it was in the original office. They were missing things out of the alumni  office. Leo was working for Murl at the time, and they decided to run  shifts and turn out all the lights in the office and one of them would be in  that office in the dark because it had been broken into several times.  They were missing things out of there and it wasn   t broken into because  whoever got in had a key. So Leo ran the early shift and Murl took the  30  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Rogers  late shift, and it was after midnight and he heard the key in the door and  a janitor came in and Murl accosted him, and he said,    Where   d you get  that key?      because he wasn   t the janitor that was supposed to even  work there at all. He said he found it under an ashtray in the card room  upstairs. But anyway, I think they arrested him and he was the one that  had stolen the money out of the Alumni Association.  Of course then, Abe was running the Student Union and Abe got rid of  him without any trouble. But that was the only time that I think they  were ever robbed. When that happened they decided they   d just catch  him, (Laughs) whoever it was that was doing it. I don   t think they kept  much money in the Alumni Association at that particular time because  most of their money came in checks. But the big things were   of course,  class reunions were very important during that time. And we would have  big crowds in the ballroom for the big alumni banquet. All the different  classes, 10-year intervals, they   d start coming back after 10 years. Then  the big deals were the 25-year and the 50-year. I don   t know whether  you did any of that in your      Yeah, we did; we did almost every 25. We used to have your 5, 10, 15,  20   I think we were doing 25 and 50 and Half-Century Club.  And the Half Century   and then of course a lot of the old ones died off.  We had a Rocky Mountain Club that met in Denver. Dr. Stiles, who was  one of the Class of 1905 or something like that   one of the very early  classes, he had an M.D., a Ph.D. and a Doctorate of Veterinary  Medicine. He was all three. He grew up in Cushing. But anyway, he was  one of the very early graduates, and he organized that Rocky Mountain  Club up in Denver and even when Ruth Ann and Jerry lived in Denver,  they used to go to the meetings. He and Mrs. Stiles ended up in a nursing  home, but he kept that Rocky Mountain Club going for a long time, it  was very important. And we had a club in Washington, D.C. and up in  that area     Still do.     and I remember we had a meeting out at the University of Maryland.  Well we had it in the back yard of an alumnus that was living there, and  had a meeting up there one time and Murl and I went to that. We had a  New York Club   and we went to the World   s Fair in 19   I can   t  remember whether it was    64 or    68. It was right after we got back from  a trip around the world. It must have been    64 because when we were in  Rome   we   d been around the world, and when we were in Rome, the  Pieta was all covered with   they   d boxed it up so they were building the  seats for Pope John XXIII   s ecumenical conference, and we didn   t get to  see the Pieta.  31  Gill  Rogers  Gill  Then we had a meeting in New York while the New York Fair was  going on, and Murl and I went up there to it and they had brought   this  might have been in    68, four years later   and they brought the Pieta to  the United States. And I   ll never forget how it looked. They had it with  velvet behind it and that white marble   it was the most beautiful thing  that I think I ever saw. We got to see the Pieta in New York at the  World   s Fair and they had a moving sidewalk that went around it. We  stayed on that sidewalk and went around it two or three times so that we  could really see it. We had seen a lot of Michelangelo   s work   the  Moses and the Sistine Chapel and all of that   but to get to see the Pieta,  we got to see it   we didn   t miss it. But anyway that was wonderful. We  had a really good club up in New York at that particular time. But Murl  got to the place where it didn   t seem feasible to try to   it was too  expensive to try to keep contact with a lot of these clubs that were far  away. When Murl retired, the Tokyo alumni sent us   I   ll show you what  they sent us   I don   t have it out right now.  Elizabeth, if it   s okay with you we   ll just go ahead and conclude our  interview.  Yes, that concludes the interview.  Elizabeth, thank you very much. This has been wonderful.  -------  -------
