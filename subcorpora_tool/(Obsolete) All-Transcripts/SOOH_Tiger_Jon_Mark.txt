 Little Thunder  Tiger  Today is Friday, February 17, 2012. I   m in Glenpool, Oklahoma,  interviewing Jon Mark Tiger at the Tulsa Indian Arts Festival where you  just won first place in graphics. Jon, you   re a graduate of the Institute of  American Indian Art. Your fine use of line has made you a presence in  Native art for many years. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Thank you for interviewing me and being a part of your program.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Talihina Indian Hospital in Talihina, Oklahoma, June 17,  1954. My mother is Harriet Scott Tiger, and my dad is Yahola Tiger Sr.  I grew up in Eufaula in McIntosh County.  Are you both Creek and Seminole?  We   re full-blood Creek. My mother is full-blood, and my dad is full-blood.  My grandparents raised me when I was three or four years old. I  think I have ten or eleven siblings. We had a big family. My grandfather  retired from the post office in    57. I remember going back out to the  house with them, staying with them ever since I was like three or four  years old.  They   re on your mom   s side?  My mother   s side, yes, maternal side. We grew up in an area called  Artussee, southwest of Eufaula. There was a Baptist church out there, as  it is, but Artussee was an old tribal town name in the Creek Nation.  Was Muscogee your first language?  No, English was my first language, actually, but Muscogee was spoken  5  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  in the home. The thing about that is my grandfather is Quassarte, and my  grandmother was from the Hitchiti line, her language. Sometimes they  spoke two separate languages when describing objects. For instance, for  star she would say kolaswv, and he would say, the Quassarte way was  kocvcumbe, so it was like that.  What is your first memory of doing art?  Probably when I was about four or five, at home. I didn   t even go to  school yet, and my grandparents    house, it was an old clapboard house,  very thin walls. It was cold in the winter time. Of course, we had a log  stove, wood stove, but she would make me stay on the bed most of the  day, especially when there was snow on the ground. She didn   t want me  to go outside because in her day, she saw a lot of sickness. There was no  clinics or doctors too much around to take care of influenza, even in the  day. She was very precautionary about my getting out in the elements as  little as I could because we didn   t have a car to go to a doctor if we  needed to go, and if we did have a car, it would break down. Some  things like that happen.  I   d sit on the bed and draw on the wall, and our wall was covered with  cardboard. It was just broken down boxes of large appliances. You  spread them out, and you nail them on the wall, and that was our  wallpaper, I guess, our decorations. Anyway, my grandmother   s the one  that encouraged me because I would sit on the bed, and I knew airplanes  would come over the house every now and then, so I   d start drawing  pictures of airplanes. We had dogs and chickens and pigs. I tried to draw  animals, just simple things. She encouraged me. Since that day, during  that time, I was encouraged by my grandmother to continue art.  She always said,    Take care of your hands.    I did. I played sports, but  she wouldn   t ever let me box. My brothers were boxers. My older  brother Ben, and Yahola Jr., and George, Mitchell, and Norman, they all  boxed. I lived out in the rural area. I didn   t get to come to town too often  at all, but I did sneak a couple of sparring rounds in the local gym.  Because she was trying to protect your hands? (Laughs)  Yes.  Did you have any other family members who were artistically inclined?  Yes. Let me see. In the home, my grandfather, his penmanship was  really outstanding. We still have ledger books at home with his  handwriting in it. He   d do that real wavy penmanship, real wavy. It   s  really, really nice.  6  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Also my uncle, his son, Chester Scott, he was an award-winning artist  back in the    60s and    70s, especially with the Five Tribes. Of course,  Jerome and Johnny Tiger and Dana Tiger, they   re our cousins on our  mother   s side. My mother is a cousin to Lucinda Tiger, which is  Jerome   s mother. Jerome   s mother is my grandfather   s sister. Jerome   s  daddy was a Seminole Tiger, and my dad   s a Creek Tiger, but we   re  related on our mother   s side, through the Lewis side, actually. Then also,  we have Knokovtee Scott, shell carver, metal worker. His dad, Kenneth,  designed the Haskell logo at Haskell Indian  Nations University  in  Lawrence, Kansas. He   s even given me the original logo of that school.  He was paid one dollar. I think it was 1939 that they adopted that seal.  Did Jerome ever see any of your art, or did you see any of his?  Yes, I   ve seen his work. We all went to church at West Eufaula  Indian  Baptist Church , and we were, of course, running around in the  churchyard. Jerome would be sitting in his car, and he   d be sketching.  I   d kind of sneak up there and look at it, see what he was drawing. He  was sketching away with the door open, just sitting in there, sketching  away. It was a picture of a naked woman, Playboy-type figure and body.  I bet this had to be 1961, and he seen me. He said,    Do you like to  draw?    I said,    Yes. I like to draw,    but I was too shy. He said,    Draw  me something,    so I run off. I didn   t. I was just that way, real shy. Of  course, we were all pretty artistic in our ways. Jonny Hawk, Jonathan  Scott, he   s our relative, too, on my grandfather   s side. We   ve got quite a  few artists in our family.  So you went to Sequoyah. Did you go to public school at all?  I went to Eufaula public school all the way up to the tenth grade.  Did you have any exposure to art in public school?  No, they did not have any art classes at all. In fact, I got in trouble a lot,  drawing in my books in study hall, and sent to the principal   s office. I  played football in high school at Eufaula with the Selmon brothers, Lee  Roy and Dewey Selmon. They were always good friends, and we played  on the same team.  They did not have an art class at all in Eufaula. My brother, George, had  went to Sequoyah, and he said,    They have art class at Sequoyah,    so I  transferred to   well, actually, I went out to Santa Fe when I was sixteen  years old.  Right after graduating high school?  7  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  No, I was actually in the eleventh grade. I was in the eleventh grade, and  my grandfather said,    There   s a school out there in New Mexico that  you should go to and check out. It   s for Indian kids with skills.    So I got  enrolled with the help of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Muskogee.  They got my ticket and gave me eighty bucks to get a coat. That   s what I  bought with my eighty bucks was a coat because I didn   t have a coat and  they said it snows out there, so that   s what I did.  I went out there for a little while, and Otellie Loloma was my high  school painting teacher. I believe she was Hopi. Then I got to know  Allan Houser. He was on campus, and he was teaching the older ones  sculpting with gigantic alabaster stones. I was in his class, pottery class.  I sat down at the table, and he gives me a stone, said,    Here, make  something out of it.     I look at it, and it   s a soapstone. I guess that   s what they start you off on  because it   s the softest stone and it   s easy to work with, so it kind of  helped me to get form going. I looked at it and looked at it, and it   s a  duck. I carved into it, and I said,    I want to make me a duck, a sleeping  duck.    I still have it to this day, the soapstone duck. Then Ms. Loloma,  she came in for the clay class, pottery class, and she helped him along  the way in that class. I did two masks in there.  Sculpted or pottery?  Pottery masks and then one bowl. I   ve still got the bowl. Well, my  mother   s got the bowl in her house, but I   ve still got the two masks and  the sleeping duck.  You get to kind of experiment with a variety of media. How did you  decide you didn   t want to do sculpture?  Well, I liked sculpture, but it wasn   t always the media where I come  from. Pencil and paper was the quickest thing to what I wanted to get  after. Pencil and paper   s the only thing I really knew. Painting classes  out there were always filled up. This is 1971. My grandfather got sick  around Thanksgiving weekend. I came home, and he didn   t have too  long to live.  Was this your first semester?  Yes, first semester. I told the school, I called out there, said,    I think I   m  going to stay,    and enrolled back in Eufaula again for a little while. He  died in May of    72 of prostate cancer at home. My brother George was  going to school in Sequoyah Indian school at Tahlequah. Graduated that  8  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  day that he died. We had to go tell him. My brother-in-law, Yahola Jr.,  and I went to Sequoyah to tell my brother and bring him home with the  family. Anyway, my brother was telling me that they do have art class  there at Sequoyah, and that interested me, right there. I said,    Well, that  sounds really good. I   m kind of interested in that.     Were you thinking of yourself as an artist?  Yes.  How early?  In high school, about that same time. Ninth grade, probably. Eighth or  ninth. Everybody in my class always wanted me to draw them  something, this and that. I even did a Eufaula Ironhead mascot one time.  My football coach   I think it was him   gave me an eight-by-four feet  plywood. I took it home and laid it on my mother   s   it   s like a box. It   s  got a bunch of clothes in it. I laid it on that. They let me go out of school  at one o   clock because I had to catch a bus at three-thirty to go home.  I went back out to my grandmother   s house, and I worked on it down  there. What they was going to do is cut it out and put it in the  homecoming float each year. It was just Ironhead man. It looked like a  Trojan-type. That was my assignment. I left Eufaula and went to enter  the Sequoyah Indian School my junior year. I did my junior year there  and my senior year there. Graduated at Sequoyah in    73.  Who was teaching art there at the time? What did you get from the art  classes?  His name was Riley White. Riley White at Sequoyah. I didn   t really  learn a lot from him, but he showed me how to cut mat, just basic tools,  a sharp X-Acto knife and a steady hand and a ruler if you need to use it.  He showed me a little bit of color combination that way for painting,  appreciate what goes with this color. The least amount of color should  appear in your mat somewhere. Sometimes it works like that. That   s not  right to say that, but yes, I guess I learned patience in his class. I   ll put it  that way.  Did you continue doing art outside of class? When did you sell your first  piece of artwork?  Well, we had a fine arts festival at the school, which was put on by the  Muskogee area BIA  Bureau of Indian Affairs , as I can remember. We  had the fine arts festival at Sequoyah, and all like Carter Seminary,  Jones Academy, (I can   t remember all the school that were involved)  9  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  they all sent their pieces down.  It was a competition?  Yes, and I got the grand award in    72 and    73.  For painting?  Yes, for a painting. It was Lady Pounding Corn is what it was. I  graduated out of Sequoyah in    73, and I knew I was going to go back to  Santa Fe. I went back out there in the fall of    73. Couldn   t get in no  painting classes out there, so I went to the painting room, the studio  room. A lot of Navajos down there painting, and they were really nice,  really outstanding work. A lot of oils and a lot of acrylics, but the styles  were different to me.  Navajos did a lot of the desert-looking and sky, big landscape, whereas a  lot of the other tribes did more real bright color, acrylic on canvas. What  I did is each evening I would go down to the studio and grab a color and  bring it back to my room. I didn   t take the best tube or the best jar, just  one that   s been used, and I   d smuggle my material back into my room  and work in my room. Worked in my room.  Then would you show each other, would you show some of your  classmates what you   d done?  No, it wasn   t like that at all because we were housed in the, it   s actually  old Army barracks from World War II. Each one had the room, some  two to a room. Not everybody was single to a room. I didn   t show much  of my work out there, but I did bring it home with me. I gave it to my  mom when I got back, after school was out.  So you were teaching yourself the basics of painting?  Yes, and I   d ask questions and study people   s work, what they were  doing, how they were approaching this and that. I remember in high  school, Ms. Loloma   when I did my first canvas, it was a man   s face,  and he was wearing a necklace. The background, I started on the  background, and I put it on real thick, and she got angry at me.  Was it oil?  It was oil. She said,    No, no, no, no  That   s too much, too much     She  got a rag and just wiped the whole thing, like that. (Gestures)    Okay.     She said,    You start off slow and go thin. Lay your colors out first, and  then you go into it. That   s how you learn.    That   s how I learned, trial  10  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  and error, and I   m glad. She taught me a lot, really.  You, at some point, got more into acrylics than oils?  Acrylics was introduced to me at Santa Fe because a lot of my friends  were on the big canvases, and the colors seemed to be brighter. It didn   t  take very long to dry. You could paint over it, tape it down. A lot of  symbolism out there, and a lot of abstract artwork at that time.  Were you at all interested in that?  No, it didn   t really touch on me that much. Color was really what I got  out of it, just the different colors I   ve seen of the blues and the reds,  what color can go with what other color. Seeing a lot of other styles of  people from different parts of the country has amazed me a lot. Acrylic  is one of my favorites now because it dries faster. I   ve learned to work  with it pretty good.  Did you consider staying in Santa Fe?  No, not really. In    61, there was nothing to it. You could walk  downtown, you wouldn   t hardly see a car go by. (Laughter) That   s not  what it is now. I could walk all the way down to the Plaza and look  around and walk through the galleries and walk back to school, just to  burn time until suppertime. It   s a whole different   you have to  appreciate the desert. I like rain and grass too much, I guess.  Green trees. (Laughs)  Yes.  Was Philbrook Annual going on at all when you started painting  actively?  Yes, they were, but I wasn   t really invited or notified of those shows. It  seemed like my cousins, Jerome and Johnny and Chester, the older ones  were invited to that one. I was just growing up. I did my first show in  1971 at, I think it was the Southroads Mall. They had a show over there.  I remember Fred Beaver being there, Bert Seabourn, David Williams.  There might   ve been a couple of other people I don   t remember right  now.  David Williams really took to my work. Fred Beaver was a really close  friend of our family because he   s from Eufaula, also. He knew my  grandparents real close. He was an inspiration, too. David Williams, I  got to know him through my brother-in-law who is Kiowa, also. Got to  11  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  know him and look at his work, study, ask questions about why is this  and why is that.  At the mall show, did you have some Muscogee images and some Plains  images? Did you have Plains images?  Mostly they were pencil drawings, what I had.  Just mainly portraits?  Seems like they were just human faces and then a few wildlife, animals.  The thing about that time is I just drew out of my head. What I could  remember is what it looks like. I only had maybe six or seven pieces on  a two-day show. I got fourth place. I was the youngest one there. I was  like seventeen years old, I think. My aunt Ruby Scott, Chester   s wife,  she encouraged me to go to that one. She said,    We   ll take you up there  every day if you want to go show your work,    so we did.  You made a trip back and forth every day?  Yes. I   d sell something, and I   d go buy me a box of model planes or  something in the hobby shop down in the mall, or a car, a model car  assembly.  Did you start doing booth shows as you could at the malls?  No, that was just a one-time deal. I did the high school show at the Five  Tribes Museum, let   s see,    72,    73,    74,    76. I started getting in at the  museum show, and I won Grand Award at the Five Tribes in high  school. Got my picture on the Muskogee Phoenix.  That   s a big award at that age.  That was a big award for me, just to see my mug in the newspaper like  that.  Was it a pencil drawing or a painting?  It was a painting. Actually, there was two paintings I entered, and they  were both watercolor. One of them was called Creek Homestead, and as  far as I know, they still have it in their collection, Creek Homestead. It  depicts an old log cabin in the background, and a lady pounding corn up  front, and a man making ball sticks. He   s weaving under a tree. Then  you have your chickens there, and you have a corn field on the side.  The other one was called Two Worlds. Two Worlds was probably about a  12  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  sixteen-by-eight. It was divided right down the middle. There was a face  in the middle with a line down the middle of it. On this side was the city.  You see the cityscape, airplanes, and on the other side was the natural  world, trees and like that. Tipi, I think, I put in there, too. I think they  still have it at the Five Tribes in the permanent collection. I   d like to see  them again since I haven   t seen them in years.  Did you get with a couple of galleries later on as you got into your mid-twenties?  No, I didn   t do any galleries. My problem was you   ve got to have a  phone, for one thing, and you have to have a car, another thing. I  hitchhiked everywhere. I did. Went to a lot of places on my feet and  never really did get in no galleries. I didn   t start really getting into the art  until I went to the  University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma  in  Chickasha.  Oh, okay. What year was that?  In    76 and    77. Then I transferred to Okmulgee Tech  OSU Institute of  Technology  in Okmulgee and took commercial art there for a little  while. Then I took up odd jobs, started working here and there, but I did  paint on the side, nothing real permanent, just, I like to do that. I felt a  need to do that. I guess just tried to stay busy. A lot of the time, I wasn   t  really out to make a lot of money or make any money at all. It was just  something I liked to do. People were noticing it, though, and they liked  it, and when they started buying my work, it started building up from  there.  Then I started buying equipment. My first table was my bed in junior  high and high school. That   s the one that Five Tribes has now on their  permanent display. I painted on my bed, chair here. (Gestures) My bed  was my table, and that was it. About the Santa Fe deal, after high school,  I went back out to Santa Fe. I   ll tell you, I did not graduate there. Some  things happened out there. (Laughs) I wanted to go back after I got out  the first year, and they told me not to come back.  As far as I can see, it was political. A friend of mine, he   s from Alaska,  very talented man. He is not used to the modern technology. Somebody  had left the TV on in the TV room all night long, and he stayed three  doors down. He was tired of it. He got up in the middle of the night.  There was nobody watching that TV, and it was going on. He was tired  of it, and he went out there and grabbed that TV and yanked it out and  throwed it out that window. He threw that TV out the window, and he  went on back to his room.  13  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Well, somebody claims that they seen him do it. Of course, a few days  went by, and they were questioning who did it. Nobody knew, but  somebody had pointed to him, and he confessed that he did do it. He  said,    All I   m used to is radio where I come from, and I don   t like to  hear this TV. If they   re not going to watch it, turn it off, or I   ll turn it off  for you.    (Laughter)  So during that time, he asked for support from some of his buddies,  staff, whoever would help him because he had to go to a hearing in  Albuquerque at the BIA. We load up in the car, and we go with him  down to his meeting place, but they never did call the other students in  for support. They just talked to him. I guess they asked what happened,  and he told them. He came back out, and he had a plane ticket in his  hand. Nothing was said. We get back in the van and drive back towards  the school, and he said,    Well, they kicked me out,    and he started  giving his things away.  The Ojibwe friends that he had, he gave a painting to one of them. He  gave a basket to another, he made. Some sketches, he   d give to just  different ones. He give me a carved snow owl with the claws coming out  of it like that. (Gestures) It   s pretty heavy. I still have it to this day. He  said,    I can   t carry this on the plane, so you can have it.    He gave it to  me. I think because of that incident, we were all labeled after that.  Blacklisted for standing up for him.  Yes, I think so.  I know that you   ve had to work different jobs over the course, starting in  your twenties and thirties, but continuing to do the art. Did you get any  business advice? What was the best business advice you got from  another artist? That   s the tricky part of it.  Probably about originals. A lot of them say,    Keep your originals or  don   t show a lot of them. If you   re going to make prints, make prints,  and keep your originals if you want to. It   s up to you.    That was one of  them. Another one is to keep up with your inventory and let the people  you trust handle it for you if you can. Don   t let people run off with your  goods. In other words, that belongs to you, and don   t let them print  something in your name without your consent.  When did you pull your first prints?  Probably the first ones I ever did was offset printing press. Did some  sketches.  14  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Was it in Tulsa?  I worked in Checotah at the newspaper office there. That   s where I  learned how to run offset press, too, and a web press, on-the-job  training.  So how old were you when you were working at Checotah?  I worked there from 1981 to    88. I worked with ink on my hands. It was  kind of a journeyman thing.  But nice for an artist to be able to     Yes, I was doing that, and I was doing darkroom work. I was doing pay  stub. I did the mail, tie and bundle and take them to the post office and  load them on the truck, and they   d take them. I did a lot of that. Guy  from Tulsa World said I should   ve come to their place. I could have got  on to, maybe, four of them places.  You didn   t do any cartoons for them, did you, or comics? (Laughs)  No, I didn   t do anything like that, no.  Were you going to galleries at all? I   m wondering how the landscape or  the Indian art scene looked to you in the    80s. What were the things you  remember?  Probably those artists that were established. Those were the main people  that I really watched or noticed or admired. Blackbear Bosin was one of  the people that inspired me. Of course, Jerome, Fred Beaver, Oscar  Howe. Some of the old timers, they inspired me a lot.  I didn   t have a chance to go to a lot of galleries growing up because I  didn   t go to Tulsa very much. When you   re in a rural area, you just don   t  have that opportunity or benefit to go anywhere. You have to make do  with what you had. Where I live at is economically depressed, even to  this day.  You began working for the Creek Nutrition Center down there in  Eufaula in 1990?  I worked there   August will be my twenty-third year, actually, come to  think of it. They needed a driver to take meals to the people in the rural  area, to the elders in the rural area, the shut-ins, and the single widowed  people. I   ve been doing it all this time, and they are also an inspiration to  me.  15  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  I was wondering how they impact your art.  They   re not all Creek people. There are some Cherokee and there are  some Pottawatomie, Choctaw, and they all have their own stories, and  they like to talk. At least, they confide in me. If they need something,  they go through me to get it. I try to listen to them whenever they have  something to say. I look at their house. One man   s a very decorated  veteran, a Choctaw man. He   s ninety-two years old now, I think. I talk  about his growing up. I think he likes to tell somebody something, and I  talk to him.  My only  thing  about that job is you   ll see them, and they   ll go. They   ll  pass away on you. That happens a lot in my line of work. You get to  know them and everything, but really it was the fact that you try to serve  people and make them feel good.  There   s one incident when I first started that job, kind of took me in the  heart because I didn   t know the man had a garden behind his house. I  didn   t know it. He was a new client on the route. I went to take him  food, and he   s always sitting at the kitchen table, looking through the  screen door. He says,    Come on in. If I   m not here, just leave it on this  table.    I said,    Okay, that   s fine,    because sometimes they might be in  the bathroom or doing something else, takes them a little longer to come  to the door. So I did. I would come to his house, and he wasn   t there, but  the door was open, and the meal was on there. So,    Maybe he   s all  right.     I leave. The next day I come there, the meal   s still there, and the door   s  still open. I said,    Uh oh.    I called his name. Nobody answers. His  neighbor, she comes out, and she says,    He   s been laying in his garden  for the past day and a half. We found him out there. He had a heart  attack.    Now, I did not know he had a garden behind that house, and I  felt bad because they had to hurry up and bury him. It   s kind of  wrenching on you sometimes.  He was an inspiration to me, too. He   d always come to my  grandmother   s house when we were kids. My grandmother always had  fruit trees. She had an apple tree, and he liked her apples. He   d always  come out there and get a peck of apples. He   d bring a nail and get a  hammer and knock that nail in that tree. He said,    This tree needs iron.  They like iron,    so he would run a nail in it every year. That thing would  bloom for twenty, twenty-five years. Longer than most apple trees last,  really.  There was a time when (and it   s still true today) artists from the Five  16  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Tribes would often do more Plains images because that   s what people  wanted and expected, and it was sometimes difficult to do Seminoles or  Muscogee people. It seems to me your work has always balanced both of  those. I don   t know if that   s so or not. Did you start out doing a little  more imagery from Plains tribes and then gradually come back around?  My interest, some of it grew out of Anadarko area because my aunt lived  in Anadarko for many years.  Oh, did you all go out that way, then?  She lived there, so when my grandfather and my grandmother would go  visit her, we   d go out there. After school was out, we   d travel. It seemed  like it took us forever to get out there, especially with Grandfather  driving forty miles an hour. (Laughter) We got out there, but Anadarko  in the    60s, to me, you   d see the men with the braids, and they would  talk sign language across the street to each other like that. (Gestures) I  thought that was pretty interesting. Out there, that   s where they have  galleries that I like to walk into. They did have galleries by the local  artists that were painting and selling.  So you went into them, browsing     I would look around in them. I would look in them, and I noticed their  paints were real bright, a lot of red and blues, blankets, scenes, peyote  scenes, and horseback riding. Those things kind of stuck to me there,  and I just started doing some Plains at first because of the features.  I started drawing out of the history books, actually my own art course to  myself, to draw from photographs out of magazines, to get the face,  wrinkles, eyes, the features. I   m pretty hard on myself when it comes to  what I want to see. If it   s not right, I   ll leave it alone, throw it in the  closet, come back to it three or four days later and look at it again. Then  I can see what I did wrong.  You let it rest in between.  Yes, I just don   t ever look at it, and then come back and look at a with a  different eye on a different day. That works for me. The Creek imagery  didn   t come until a little later on because there was a lot of people didn   t  understand it.  Maybe in the 90s?  Actually it started in the mid-   70s, well, actually in the early    70s, like  Creek Homestead, that was my major student art piece. That was  17  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  intentional for people to see the Creek side. I didn   t want just to show  the Plains. There   s more to Oklahoma than just the western plains.  We   re eastern tribes, and we have our own ways and language and  stories.  Your primary medium is still pretty much acrylic?  Pencil.  You never did try your hand at sculpture again?  No. That   s just because I didn   t go out of my way to find it. I did one  piece at my mother   s house on a stone I found. After the grater grated up  these stones, I kept seeing this certain stone on the side of the road, so I  pick it up one day, and I   m going to throw it in the back seat of my  station wagon. It   s shaped like a buffalo. It is, it   s shaped like a buffalo,  but it   s square. It   s broken in that shape. I get me a nail and a chisel and  a hammer, and I start chiseling out this design, and it   s a buffalo. My  mother still has it in her house or around her house to this day, but that   s  about all, just homemade stuff.  Do you do a lot of thumbnail sketches before you paint, or do you sketch  directly on the   do you use mainly board?  Both. I   ll do some preliminary sketches, rough sketches. Some are real  rough, and some are just right to it, and I hit it right on the button. I say,     I   m just going to leave it like that, go with it like that.    Then some  days, there   s nothing there. It   s still in my head. My head to my hand,  I   m still waiting for that to come out.  I   ve got stories right now that I need to bring out. I   m getting back to my  histories, my local history, family stories. Let me tell you about one. I   m  going to do this. Growing up at home, we had a chicken house at the  back of the house. I got up out of bed early one morning, and I see my  grandmother. She had a rag around her hand on this side. (Gestures) I  look at it, and I see my grandpa over there. He   s asleep, but he had a rag  on this side of the hand. (Gestures) (Laughter)  I   m looking. I asked my grandmother, I said,    What did you do to your  hands?    She said,    We had to fight an owl last night. You was already  asleep, but we were laying in bed, and I could hear a clucking of a  chicken out there. I didn   t know whether there was a snake in there or  what it was, possum or something, but we went out there. We took a  lantern out to the chicken house.     The chicken house is only five feet high and maybe six feet deep with  18  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  chicken wire all around it.    When I look up in there,    she said,    there  was an owl sitting right next to one of those hens on that one ledge, and  it would gradually scoot over. When it gradually scoots over, it   ll knock  that hen off, hit the ground. When that hen hits the ground, that owl just  pounces on top of them. That   s the only way they   ll attack them, kill  them, so we were out there. We opened that door, and I think somebody  says,    Grab it     Somebody grabs it     (Laughter)  They put their hand like that, and the owl can see at night in the dark real  good. When they went like that, that owl went claws up in that hand. He  put his hand in there, and he put claws in his hand like that. So that owl  was like this. The claws almost went through their hand, almost. They  backed out like that, and she was holding the lantern. She says,    Twist  his head  Twist his head      My grandpa said he was twisting that owl   s head, but it kept going round  and round and round. So they finally went up there and got an ax, had to  get an ax and just cut that owl   s head off. Next day I went out there   my  job was to gather the eggs. That was my job. I go out there to the  chicken house, and I look in the weeds, and there   s an owl   s head  looking right at me. (Laughs)  Oh, man, that   s a story that needs to be painted, for sure   I   m going to do something like that, if not for anybody, just for my  family. It   s a family story, really.  Do you work from photographs now a little bit more? Do you ever pose  family members and take a photo so you have a particular pose that you  can draw, or is it mostly from your head?  It   s mostly from my head. I have a big family, a lot of nieces and  nephews, and can   t keep up with all of them. Some of that appears in my  art, their face, their image.  But you   re drawing from memory at that point?  Yes. The one painting I have, it   s called Omen. It started out to be a  Trail of Tears picture. It   s actually two stories, but it started out to be  Trail of Tears. The lady in the front, she   s in a pink blanket. She   s  looking out. She   s going forward. She   s in the lead. But she came out  looking just like my grandmother did. It just came out like that, so I just  leave it like that. It came out real well. It looks like her.  I put the owl in the tree, though, next to it because that   s another story  that relates to my grandmother when she passed away and my tribe. In  19  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  the Creek Muscogee tribe, Owl is always a messenger of death or  something in that way, a sickness. We just got through having a prayer  meeting for her, and everybody left. Me and her was the only one at the  house, and she was in the bed. I went to get her a drink of water, and  when I went down the hallway, an owl was right at the door. It hooted  real loud. We heard it. I heard it, and she heard it. I take the glass of  water back to her, and she drank it. She said,    Did you hear that?    I said,     Yes,    and nothing more was said. The whole thing kind of went  together in that. That   s why I call it Omen.  I   m glad you mentioned that category. Did you win the Trail of Tears  category at any point?  I won Trail of Tears category last year, I believe, with a piece called  Broken Spirits. It was a miniature, actually, a pencil miniature. It   s a  small three-by-four, image-size regulation, anyway. I did that and won.  That   s great. You   ve always had this medium-sized format, but it seems  to me you   re doing more miniatures now, which is the reverse of most  artists who might spread out.  I don   t like to waste paper. (Laughter) That   s why I do a lot of  bookmarks, too.  Your eyes are still good. (Laughs)  Yes, with the help of eyeglasses and sometimes a magnifying glass, too.  I don   t like to waste paper. I don   t if I can help it.  Do you keep track of your ideas in a notebook, or do you just carry them  in your head?  No, I just carry it in my head, and sometimes it comes on the art itself.  Getting back to the Plains Indian themes, a lot of that has to do with my  in-laws, too, my family that married into the Cheyenne-Arapahos, and  the Kiowas, Comanches, Winnebagos. We   re just all over.  So when you   re doing an image like that, that   s your research, is  through family members?  It can be, yes. I   ll ask them questions if there   s something related to the  Creek tribe in some way or another. See, I like to do a lot of history, too.  Oh, you like to read history?  I like history. I like stories. I   m still wanting to do one when the Lakotas  20  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  came through Okmulgee one time. Did you know that? They came to  Okmulgee, the Creek Nation. The Siouxs were having a hard time where  they were at, and they offered Spotted Tail, chief, a land base here  around Okmulgee. They wrote, they said,    We   ll give you some land  down here if you all want to come down here.    They were being  persecuted up that way, so his band comes down here, stays a little  while, looks around, and he says,    Your country   s very nice, but we  want to go back home.     I don   t know who has the photographs of that visit, but there are some  available somewhere of Spotted Tail and his group coming to visit. They  went to Dripping Springs, went up to the Springs and looked. They  made a visit all the way around, but they said,    It   s too hot down here,  for one thing. It   s humid.    (Laughter)    We want to go back up north  where it   s cool.    Those are the stories I   d like to show sometime.  Yes, those lesser known, the ones that aren   t as well known. Factoring  in for when you   re not at work, what   s your creative routine? Is it a  weekend thing, or does it depend?  It   s always, all the time. I   m always looking and seeing, feeling.  People   s telling me stories, and I visualize them. I can sit there and just  see it. They   re just always with me, always ready to create, but it   s  sitting down, doing it. My best time is probably in the late afternoon and  evening. I used to paint late at night, but I can hardly stay up anymore.  (Laughter) I do what I can. I need to rest my head every now and then,  take it easy and replenish my thoughts. I   m up pretty early in the  morning. I can do a lot of things before seven sometimes. Another trick  is to fast before you paint or when you   re ready to paint. Don   t even eat  nothing all day long, just paint. Things seem to come clearer for me  when I do that. That   s sometimes part of my practice, to fast.  Have you done any workshops with young people?  I want to start doing that. I thought about it for longer than I should. We  have a lot of talented young kids in the Eufaula area, and they are really  creative painters. There are some kids that would like to write. I   m not  really in touch with what the high school is doing or what the local  school is doing for the kids, but they have been introduced to the  different mediums, I know. I   d like to take it a little bit further for them,  take it out of the classroom and bring that out to the Indian world, you  might say, because I was fortunate enough to grow up with  grandparents, elder. My grandparents were born in 1898. They could tell  me things that happened all the years ago, but you don   t have that  anymore.  21  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Now I   m the grandparent, but I would rather pass it on to the younger  ones, the stories that I know, because they could be doing the same thing  in their young life because they   re going to be facing a lot of things in  their life. To record this through art is one of the better mediums, I think,  without showing it on film. You can do it through art, and the story will  come out of it. That   s what I do with my art right now. I put stories  behind the back of my prints because people don   t understand what I   m  painting sometimes or they don   t understand the Indian side of it, so they  appreciate that.  I   m sure the kids would like to have a workshop or something to work  with. That   s what I want to do with them when the school break comes  up in March. That   s my plan. If I even get about three or four, that   s a  start. If I   m going to leave anything, it   s going to be that for them.  Looking back over your career so far, what is a pivotal moment when  you might have gone down one road but you took another?  Negative stuff?  Or positive.  Well, I went through my negative years and had my wild times. I think  everybody kind of goes through that, but I   m fortunate to be sitting here  talking about it. A lot of my friends are no longer with us. I think in  1985, I didn   t do anything. I don   t think you   ll find a piece of work I  done in    85 because I was so disoriented, I guess you might say. I lost  my way, and I almost lost my gift. It   s a gift from God that was given to  me. I later realized if you don   t use it, you   re going to lose it. I almost  lost it. It took me almost a year to sit down and start sketching  something, and I started getting my feeling back.  I realized to myself, I said,    Not everybody can do this drawing. Nobody  can just sit down and just draw. They wish they could, but they can   t.    I  was in that area where I can just sit and draw something now. But then I  realized,    This is a gift, and I   m surely messing up if I   m not going to  use this, if I don   t straighten up, fly right.    If anything, I could show  somebody else how to do art or how to see things and how to appreciate  creativity in one way or the other. That was probably my down time. It  was a really bad time for me.  What   s been one of the high points of your career?  Probably now, I think, because it seems to get better. People seem to  appreciate Native American art, anyway. You can   t please everybody,  and everybody has their own styles. That   s one thing that I see now in a  22  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  lot of these shows. I   d hate to be a judge. There   s a lot of different  styles. Some pieces don   t get selected, and I think they should have, but  I   m not the judge. Now it   s pretty exciting. It   s pretty good. I like it.  Seeing people create things, it inspires me, also.  Besides sharing technical things with a young person, what would you  tell a young person who wanted to get into Native art, doing Native art  today?  I   d tell them to know their history and who they are. Ask questions. If  you have an elder in your house, in your family, ask questions, why is  this and why is that. If you can   t find somebody that will tell you, we  have elders out there that need to be reached out to. They think they are  useless sometimes, and I don   t want them to feel that way. That   s why I  try to get the young and the old together, if they can just spend a little  time together, because some of these young ones have never been  around an elder person at all, and a lot of them are in nursing homes. I   d  just encourage them to draw and paint whatever they can, if they have it.  Study their history. You get educated that way, also.  Is there anything that we   ve forgotten to talk about that you   d like to  discuss?  Probably think about it tonight, and I   ll let you know tomorrow.  (Laughter)  Well, let   s take a look at some of your artwork, then. Can you tell us  about this piece?  This is titled Grandma   s Kitchen, and it   s depicting three ladies    food  preparation. What we have here is a lady. She   s stirring the pot. It might  be sofke, or corn soup, in it. The lady in the middle is pounding corn in  the wood mortar. We call that kitcho or kitchubi. The lady on the end,  she   s sifting the corn in the sifting basket. Of course, you have your log  cabin in the back and your brush harbor out here.  In the summertime or the warm season, they used to cook outdoors a lot.  That   s where the kitchen was at, actually. Eat outdoors. This is all done  in graphite and graphite pencil. I have two scissortail birds up here, the  state birds. You always hear them around my house in the summertime.  Those clouds are coming up, too.  Yes, the clouds are coming up. That   s a good sign of rain. We need rain  all the time. When it   s been really hot in the summer, you always like to  have a little shade and clouds and a little rain.  23  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  The pot here is kind of tilted because that   s the way my grandmother  used her pot. She wouldn   t lay it flat. She would lean it a little bit. That  way she could put her spoon in there better and stir things at a direct  angle. That   s why it   s tilted-looking a little bit. And, of course, she could  be holding corn grits. Sometimes it   s meat. It could be pork with the  corn. The baskets here, it   s a very rare item these days because you don   t  hardly see any sifting baskets, especially made by the Creek Nation or  Creek tribe. Very few people make it.  Time to revive that.  This one is a Creek stickball stick with ball. It   s a watercolor. I have  these in my house. They were both made by the late Tony Mitchell. He  made both of these. He gave me the ball to show that this is the  traditional ball that the tribal towns used in ballgame. They   ve got the  long buckskin string that   s all wrapped in buckskin, and they   re tied. I  tried to show the tie features on there when they   re made properly.  You   ve really got some nice detail. You can see the different textures so  well, too.  Yes, the wood in mine is supposed to look like wood. That   s the way it  looks. When he made it, he polished it down real fine. He used glass to  cut it, to shave it. He used broken glass, windowpane. That   s what they  use. Of course, it   s wrapped with buckskin, tied off. That ball   s of a  buckskin hide, also.  It   s beautiful.  This is called New Moon Song. The idea comes from the Cahokia  Mounds from Illinois, the ancient Mississippians, where now they have  a museum and several mound sites on the property. The large painting is  a forty-by-thirty-two original on canvas. The story behind this one is this  is the Monks Mound at the Cahokia Mound site. There was a house on  top. If you look real good, there   s the four men standing outside. I have  these men kind of like a silhouette in the dark part.  The new moon has always been a symbol of renewal of each month, and  the moon has always been used to cut hair or plant. I was trying to  educate people that you use your lunar signals to do different things that  you want to do, like cut hair, plant corn, make medicine. It   s always  been a renewal time, and it   s always for the good.  You still have that original?  24  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Yes, I have the original. I still do. This one won first place at Cahokia,  2011. It got second place at Bartlesville Indian Summer and third place  at the Cherokee Art Market, all last year.  That   s wonderful.  I depict the elders, the four of them here. There   s four seasons and the  four directions. People were close to the Creator and its elements. You  live in your environment because we all live there in that same world, so  they watched. You have people that watches the stars and people that  watches the seasons. You   ll have somebody watch the Milky Way and  which way it goes. They made decisions according to these  surroundings, and so I depict these men, the Cahokia people and the  Mississippian, which is what the Muscogee Nation people are since we  come from different tribal towns. We are Mound people. That   s who we  are.  That   s really nice. And then the new one, a brand new print?  Yes, it   s pretty new. This one depicts a man and woman. She   s laying  down the law. She done told him once or twice about that. (Laughter) As  you see, he   s hiding a bottle behind him and holding his arm up against  her forceful appearance, and he ripped his sleeve right there in the  process. He   s got a jug right here. She   s just laying down the law and  saying,    I don   t want this around the house.     What   s the title again?  What Did I Tell You About That Drinking?  In the corner, is that a little     A little turtle right here. A little turtle   s watching it all going on. People  like that. They laugh. It   s just to break the monotony a lot of times of  serious artwork. You throw little scenes in like that, and people can  relate to it sometimes. I think a lot of people go through it more than you  think.  Humor is always good.  I try to humor people about different things. That whole thing is  alcoholism has always been a big issue in the Indian country. It   s not  just Indian people. It   s everybody. It breaks up homes. It hurts people.  It   s a negative drug. It   s too bad a lot of people are dependent on it. I,  myself, broke that cycle, and I don   t want to go back to that lifestyle  anymore. It   s a reminder to myself a lot of times. You know, we have to  25  Little Thunder  Tiger  live with each other every day. We try to get along and encourage one  another to be more positive in your life and hope and pray for the best.  Thank you for sharing that, Jon, and thank you for taking the time to do  this interview.  Thank you for your time, too. I   m glad to do it.  -------  -------
