 Little Thunder  McMurtry  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is January 6, 2011, and  I   m interviewing Robby McMurtry for the Oklahoma Native Artist  Project sponsored by Oklahoma Oral History Program at OSU. We   re  here at Robby   s home in Morris. Robby, you   re a storyteller who creates  colorful characters in painting and print, also an educator. You were  born in Loco, Oklahoma, which is a real place although it sounds like it  comes straight out of a story. What was it like growing up there?  Actually I was born in San Antonio, Texas, but I grew up in Loco,  Oklahoma. That   s the first place I remember. Loco, Oklahoma was a  very rural area   it had a tiny school. The school was so tiny we had to  go to school somewhere else. (Laughter) Loco was where we got our  mail and did our shopping and everything. It is still exists. There   s  maybe two hundred people there, but it was as rural as you can get in  Oklahoma, probably. Mostly ranches   that was the main economy  around there. Ranching and a little farming. Not much farming, because  it was too dry.  Is that what your father did for a living? Was he a rancher?  My father tried to be a farmer or a rancher. He kind of played at it, but  mainly he was a veteran of the Army. He was in the service for a long  time. We, periodically, over about twelve or fourteen years, would move  away from Loco to some Army base in California or Germany or  anywhere, and move back to Loco, and then go somewhere else again.  What about your grandparents? Where they close by, or did they play a  role in your life?  My mother   s parents were close by, and they were hardscrabble farmers.  They tried to farm whatever they could. I loved my grandparents, but  5  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  going to visit them was always work. (Laughs) They always were  growing gardens and fixing fence and stuff. (Laughs) But I liked to go  and listen to them talk at night. They both told stories about how they  came to Oklahoma as children. That was really interesting to me. My  other grandmother lived in Duncan. That   s my father   s mother  on my  Comanche side . She was a very strange, spooky old woman that we  would go to see. She was a little bit scary to me, but really interesting  because when she would talk I would listen, too. Unfortunately, she  passed away when I was, I think, nine, and left me  33 dollars.  That was probably a good sum for her. What kinds of art experiences  did you have in school?  Very little. There was no art at the school, actually, where I went to  school, public school. Which was Velma/Alma. There was no real art  program. Occasionally, I   d see an artist who would do a show in Duncan  or somewhere like that. Really, as far as I knew, when I was a kid, I was  the only artist around. (Laughter)  Did you think of yourself as an artist as a child?  Yeah. That   s all I really thought I could do. That was my thing. I wasn   t  big enough to play football. We lived too far from town to do any  activities, anyway. It was twenty miles. I rode on a school bus an hour  every morning and every afternoon. I did a lot of drawing on the school  bus  (Laughter)  Did you have access to materials?  Yeah, I could always scrounge paper and pencil. That was the main  thing. When I got a little older at school, I discovered typing paper  without lines, and that was great for drawing. I did gravitate to another  guy, a Cherokee guy, who went to our school. He became like my best  friend. He was the only other artist that was around. We would work on  each other   s drawings and go camping together. He was my buddy.  Did cartoons play a role in your interest in art?  They did. I was a comic book aficionado when I was a kid. At the army  bases we had no T.V. most the time, even when we were in Loco. So,  entertainment was the radio or the funny papers or comic books, if I  could get them. I could only get comic books in Duncan, and that was a  forty minute trip from the house. So, comic books to me   I would read  them over and over and just look at the stories. At the same time I was  doing this, I was listening to older people talk about stories, things that  would happen. I would imagine the pictures as they were telling these  6  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  stories. I would imagine the things that they were telling me in a comic  book. It seemed like the same kind of stories. I learned to draw from  comic books more than anything else. Some friends showed me different  things, and I found a couple of books when I was in high school. But  basically, I taught myself just by looking and copying other people.  What was your first exposure to Indian culture?  Indian culture around Loco   it   s the edge of Comanche country, so  there were some Comanches living there. But they were rodeo people,  they really weren   t pow-wow people. There were other tribes, too.  Choctaws, because it   s Choctaw and Chickasaw country also. I knew  there were pow-wows because they had those in Comanche and Duncan,  different places. But I really wasn   t aware that there was an Indian  culture, per se, until I got away from the house, until I got out and saw it.  (Laughs) There were a lot of people around but there wasn   t like a  community of certain groups.  And because your access to art was limited, you probably didn   t see  much Indian art?  No. Occasionally there would be something in Duncan or Comanche.  An artist would have a show at a drugstore or trading post, and I   d go  see that if I could get over there. I remember when I was in high school,  some of the banks had Indian art shows and those seemed really classy.  That was where I first started seeing a lot of different styles of Indian art,  specifically.  Were you interested in that as a subject matter?  Oh yeah, yeah. It seemed like stuff that had happened right there where I  was living. When I would ride the school bus, I remember I would look  out   the other kids would be talking and playing and laughing, but  I   d be watching the country, just imagining what was going on out there  in the field or on that prairie. Over there under that mountain, off in the  distance. There was a mountain called Hat Top Mountain that could be  seen for thirty miles. I guess it can still be seen. (Laughter) Just  imagining people in that landscape doing things, living. Doing cattle  drives, or buffalo hunts     You went to college in Chickasha. What did you major in?  I tried to major in art but I flunked out as an art major. Because,  although  my teacher  was a wonderful artist and he could do really  interesting stuff, I just couldn   t discipline myself to spend a semester  painting a couple of still lifes. The first still life I did turned out to not  7  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  have the proper things in it. It was a package of cigarettes and some  other things. That all sounds real pass     that   s the kind of stuff you see  in still lifes now. I got bad grades in art. I was flunking out as an art  major, getting D   s and F   s. I know a lot of it was my fault, because I  didn   t want to do that stuff.  I loved figure drawing. I got really good grades in figure drawing but  every other class I just bombed. My friend up there was a poet named  Lance Henson. He said,    Man, get your degree in English.    (Laughter)  He was working on his degree at the same time, and I thought,    Well,  okay, we could go to class together.    (Laughter) And as I got into it, I  found,    Well, I could use this to learn how to write stories, these stories  I   ve been wanting to tell. I   ve been wanting to paint them and now I can  write them and tell about them. So it started all coming together. I was  painting, I painted after I graduated. Well, during college, even, I started  painting and selling a few pieces.  Were they Indian paintings?  Mostly, yeah. A lot of western stuff, too. I did that for a number of  years. But I   ve always wanted to do something like comic books. Tell  stories graphically, which my paintings really are if you look at them.  They tell like mini-stories, little tiny episodes. But I wanted a longer  narrative, something more epic, I guess. (Laughter)  Lance is a Cheyenne poet. I think he is part of the reason why a play you  had co-written with Linda Poolaw ended up being produced in Tulsa.  Yes, when I was in college there in Chickasha, that was when I really  first discovered an Indian community. Fortunately or unfortunately, they  were mostly Kiowas. (Laughter) We had an Indian club and we   d put on  pow-wows and stuff. Linda Poolaw was in English class with me and the  assignment was to write a play. It was Playwriting class. He was going  to show us the form, so we decided to collaborate on the idea. She would  come to my house in the evening or I would go to her house and we  would write or not. (Laughter) Basically, the story was called, I can   t  remember what the story was. What was it called?  The name of the play was    Skins.     Skins, right. Yeah. It was about some local Indian guys trying to go to  college. It was performed at the college  in Chickasha , several  performances. Then it traveled to Anadarko and Lawton. A couple years  later, it was made it into another production in Tulsa. Didn   t get very  good reviews. (Laughs)  8  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  It was one of the first Native plays in Tulsa. Were you selling your  artwork when you were in college, too?  A little bit, yeah. Anadarko was right there, close by. And there were  several gift shops and trading posts. They were real trading posts in  those days. I   m not trying to sound like I   m really an old guy. But there  were real trading posts around that had been there for fifty or sixty years.  A lot of pawn shops, too. There used to be a lot of pawn shops. I don   t  know if there still are or not.  What were some of the competitive shows you did early on?  Just local art shows like Duncan. I showed at Indian Fair  in Anadarko   a few times. Later on, when I met some other artists who were older and  more professional, I started going to art shows with them. I went with  Leonard Riddles to a lot of places. Leonard and Doc and I all went  together sometimes to Tulsa and different places around the state. I think  we went down to Texas once or twice.  How did you meet Leonard? He was a pretty important Indian artist.  Leonard is a very distant relative   I   m not sure exactly how   but my  dad told me about him. He lived at Walters, which was a good hour and  a half away from Duncan. Leonard came to church in Duncan, so I met  him over there. He started inviting me down to his house. He lived way  out on the bald, unmarked prairie. It was so easy to get lost out there.  There were no land marks, whatsoever. None.  Did you show him your work?  Yeah.  Do you think he influenced you in anyway?  Oh, a lot. Leonard loved to tell stories. He would sit up all night long,  until two or three a.m., and just tell stories and things that he heard. He  was just a font  of information  because he   d started gathering stuff too,  when he was a kid. Started drawing when he was a teenager. And he   d  talked to the old, old people.  A lot of cultural information.  Right. He knew a lot of   I want to say arc ane  knowledge about  Comanches, things that nobody else knows about, probably. There were  some things he wouldn   t talk about at all, but I knew he knew about  them. He just wouldn   t say. (Laughs)  9  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  How did you end up in the Stillwater area? After Chickasha?  I had a girlfriend up there. I started going up there. Once I got up there, I  found out there were a bunch of people that I knew from Loco and  Chickasha and Anadarko. So, I just started hanging out in Stillwater  some. And I knew Ben Harjo there.  There was a little artists    community?  Yeah, and right after I graduated from college, my friend, Jon West,  said,    Come to Tulsa.    I said,    Okay.    (Laughter) So, when I got up  there to stay with him, he said,    I   m going back to college. Do you want  my job?    He was the janitor at the Tulsa Indian Youth Council and I was  broke. I said,    Okay.    I took his job and  ended up  working down there.  After a while, the people I was working with, they   d seen my drawings  laying around and things, and they started asking me to work in the  youth program, which was arts and culture. So, I was given a job at the  Indian Youth Council.  That was your first art teaching experience, I guess.  Yeah, it really was. Well, in college I had done some volunteer work at  places like Hog Creek and Fort Cobb with a group of kids. Just for one  or two evenings. But up there it became a real job, and I enjoyed it. Of  course, I was also doing other things. Driving a bus. Ben was working  there. He was the cultural director, but he also ended up being the  maintenance man and mechanic and everything. It was a real small staff.  (Laughter)  So did you and Ben get hooked up with the Art Market about the same  time?  Yes, Ben had met  Linda Greever . She called me and told me to come  down. This was after we both lost our jobs  at Tulsa Indian Youth  Council . I had invited Ben to be in a show with me, a two-man show at  a little gallery.  Do you remember the name?  I   m sorry. Then shortly after that, we both lost our jobs for the same  reasons, basically. I won   t go into that. (Laughs)  What year?  1976, I   m thinking. I think it was the same year I got married. And he  10  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  had met people in the Art Market, and he invited me to come down and  meet them. That   s how I met Linda Greever. At the time, her Art Market  was more or less art to put over your couch. Stuff to match your  furniture. It was a lot of Eastern and European things. No local flavor  stuff at all, just a completely generic gallery. It could have been  anywhere in the Western Hemisphere.  Because she   d inherited that body of work.  I didn   t realize that.  So, the Indian artists that she handled really influenced  its direction.   Ben was the first one she handled. I think Ben really kind of turned her  on to that.  How did you meet Lesa,  your wife ?  I was a counselor at Tulsa Indian Youth Council. I was doing classes  and counseling kids, and she came in with Annette Arkeketa, a girl I was  working with, who did a lot of things around the Youth Council. They  went to school together. They came in one day, and I said,    Oh my God,  who   s that?     So, you met your wife in Tulsa. (Laughter)  But strangely, my wife had just moved up here from Duncan. We didn   t  know each other there, but we knew some people there very well. We  knew some of the same people.  A large vein of your work has focused around period representations of  cowboys and Indians from the    50s. Did you settle on the subject pretty  early on in your career? Or did it evolve gradually? My son called  you   the Pepsi Cola guy because you used to do the old fashioned signs.  (Laughter)  I don   t know. I guess that was a little bit of Andy Warhol stuff that came  to me when I was in college. (Laughter) I don   t know. But that   s the  icons that I remember as child from the    50s and    60s.  Doc Tate Nevaquaya, who was another Comanche artist, gave you the  name Aquasuu.  Aqaquasuu. I spelled it wrong.  You signed your painting s  that way for a little awhile. Can you explain  11  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  how that came about?  I was having dinner at Doc   s house one evening. I think it was dinner.  Anyway, we were sitting at the table and he just started calling me that.  It means    Red Shirt.    I had on a red shirt. He knew my name but he just  kept calling me that. Caught his eye or something. (Laughter) I kind of  liked it, so I started putting it on my paintings for a while. Then people  started calling me that, too, the people that knew what it meant. Of  course, to most people, it would be meaningless, it   s just a jawbreaker.  (Laughter) I could say it means anything and who would know except a  Comanche?  Is that why you dropped it eventually?  Yeah, it was kind of  an  identity thing. People didn   t recognize me and  it was hard to sign my checks, Aqaquasuu. (Laughter).  How did Doc influence you as an artist, either in terms of business or  style?  Doc talked about business a lot. He told me on more than one occasion,     Robby, if you   re going to be an artist you   ve got to have a gimmick.     Right away I saw,    Well, he   s a flute player.    And he was an excellent  flute player. May have been a better flute player than he was an artist. I  thought,    Well, that   s pretty neat.    I think that   s really when I started  using the logos, the Coca-Cola.  Something that would make you stand out?  Yes, something that would cut me out from the rest of the herd a little  bit. Plus, I was doing more contemporary stuff and almost nobody was  doing that. It was scenes from 1850 or something like that.  Had you seen T.C. Cannon   s work?  I had not.  Or  Harry Fonseca , the guy who does the coyotes?  Yeah, I know who you   re talking about. I had not. But when I saw T.C.  Cannon   s work I just   I blossomed when I saw that because he had  even more ideas.  When you first started showing along with Ben and other artists in some  of the Indian art galleries, how was your work received? What was the  landscape like?  12  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  At that time there were a lot of local   they called them trade fairs. They  were being done by a lot of local municipalities. That was the art scene  in those days. It was pretty busy. You could go to one every month, even  more in the summer time.  Were they in the  town  square?  Usually. Sometimes they   d be in a shopping center. They were starting  to build some malls, then. That   s when malls starting to be built. And  they were in the new malls. That was one of the big things for the new  malls. You could drive to Oklahoma City and Tulsa and go to big ones.  There were small ones, too, in Duncan and Lawton, Comanche.  Different places.  Were you making enough money to get by?  Yeah, it was a big help. It really was. I was still a student. When the  gallery scene started, the trade fairs just kind of went away, I guess.  Maybe they still do them. There are only a few big ones now, really  huge ones. Red Earth and different things like that.  When did you begin teaching at Morris?  After I left Tulsa Indian Youth Council, I went to work for Cherokee  Nation as an Artist-in-Residence. Actually, it was through the State Arts  Council. They were doing half the funding and sending artists to  different sites. I was sent to the Cherokee Nation. Tribal politics being  what they are, I came back from vacation one summer and my whole  department had been dismembered, or however you want to say it.  How long had you been there?  Two years. So the Arts Council said,    Well, if you want to go to Morris  you can check it out.    So, I came down here and looked at it. It seemed  like a nice community. It   s very small, not a whole lot bigger than Loco.  I was an Artist- in-Residence here and when that ended, I was hired as  the Cultural Coordinator through the Creek Nation to take care of the  cultural aspects.  For  their  Indian education  program .  Which is kind of strange, because I didn   t speak any Creek. I didn   t  particularly know their history, but what I   ve learned. I   ve really studied  it. It   s been a lot of fun. Probably eighty percent of the kids here are  Creek and a smattering of every other tribe, too. My best student this  13  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  year is a Kiowa kid. (Laughter)  How have your experiences teaching informed your art?  Well, I like to tell stories in my art and the kids pick up on that. Younger  people have a hard time with a lot of what we call    fine art    because it  just doesn   t speak to them. A lot of stuff that they see in museums and  art books, it   s as far removed from anything they know, as it can be.     Why do we have to learn this crap? (Laughs) What   s this all about?  What   s so great about the Mona Lesa?    I understand that the Mona Lesa  is great, don   t get me wrong. I   m just saying that I think the education  community is a little bit snobby about stuff like that. Kids can learn  more about that when they go into college, if they   re interested in it. It   s  just pretty much useless at the public school level, I think. There are a  few kids who get it, but most of them don   t. And don   t want to.  Has it helped, bringing your own things into the school room?  Oh yeah. Mainly, I think, because the kids see I know what I   m talking  about. If you   re an art teacher, and the kids don   t even know if you can  draw or throw a pot or anything, why should they listen to you?  (Laughter) You   re just going to give them assignments in books and  show them how to do weavings and things. But I draw. And that   s one  thing that I get a little trouble about from the public school. I   m expected  to do a lot of stuff. I can   t weave, I can   t throw a pot   I can do a little  bit of braiding. Mostly, I draw. That   s all we do. If you can find what a  kid is interested in drawing, that   s what   s going to hook them.  When did you first try your hand at writing and illustrating your own  stories?  Gosh, in first grade. (Laughter) I swear. I remember my teacher, my first  grade teacher, she made a big deal out of it. Because I would turn all my  worksheets over, all my coloring sheets, or whatever, I would turn them  over and I would divide the paper into four pictures. And I would draw  little     Comic book panels?  Right. At the time, I was doing Zorro. (Laughter) She called my mom to  come visit with her about it and everything.  So she saw it? Was she upset?  No, no. She thought it was great. She encouraged me to do more of it.  And then we moved again.  Gesture   14  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry   You  lost a mentor. In 2003, I think, you published    Song of Moon  Pony.    Can you explain what that book is about and how you got the  idea for it?  Song of Moon Pony was a story I got from Leonard Riddles, the basic  story. I edited it somewhat     A traditional Comanche story.  Right. Leonard had written several books already. He had them typed  and everything. Even had mimeographed copies made of them. None of  them were on the computer. I often wondered what had happened to all  that stuff because he had a lot of it that he compiled himself. He was  writing at least one book, I know. But it was never published. He told  me that story   one of many   and years later, I decided that would make  a good children   s book. I thought it was a beautiful story. Even before I  did it as a children   s book, I   d been telling it as a story to my kids and  grandkids, and school kids for years.  There are so many things they can relate to. Like not feeling attractive,  or like they   ll never get the girl, or guy, they   re interested in.  I think so. It   s a real story about real people.  What role has Lesa played in helping you juggle your teaching and  artistic career?  Lesa has been very supportive. She really has. She doesn   t go with me to  art shows anymore because it   s just so exhausting. I don   t even go to art  shows much anymore if I can get out of it. I   d rather stay home and do  my art. Lesa and I eloped and ran away about three days after she  graduated from high school and she   s been with me ever since. Making a  place for me to do what I do. She   s supporting me right now. (Laughter)  You   ve been exhibiting and lecturing abroad for a number of years in  places like Luxemburg, Portugal, Austria. How has that impacted your  work?  Lance Henson, my friend from college called me one time and asked me  if I would be interested in something. It had nothing to do with art. He  asked me if I would be interested in lecturing in Luxemburg and a trip to  Europe, and I said,    Sure.    I had never really lectured before, except  kids. Went and did it. And when I was there, I started seeing the  European art scene, and the European art scene is comic books. It   s  graphic novels. (Laughter) They   ve developed it. When you go into a  15  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  person   s home, where some people in this country have shelves of  books, they have shelves of graphic novels. That adults read. (Laughter)  They   re great stories. Their best writers, their best story tellers and their  best artists work on them. In America, comic books are still for kids.  Looked down on?  I have to hide my comic books. People make fun of me. But that   s where  I first decided I really wanted to get back to that. That   s what I always  wanted to do, I just put it aside. I wanted to do graphic novels and  comics, and tell stories about Oklahoma. About the place I know, where  I grew up. The people or the descendants of the people I know.  You did a sculpture of  a  stickball player     Seven stickball players.  For Chattanooga, Tennessee.  That was a story, also. I got with a group called Gadugi. We formed a  group with some Cherokee artists, and we did a project in Chattanooga,  Tennessee on the river. I designed and built and installed seven stickball  players who were coming down from the Pleiades, which is a Cherokee  story   that they originated in the Pleiades. There were seven stickball  players coming down. The entire thing is, I think, a hundred and eighty  feet long. The stickball players are about twelve, fourteen feet high.  Did you know what Bill  Glass  was doing? Did each of the artists know  what the other artists were contributing and work together at some  point?  A little bit. But the exhibits themselves are separate. You see mine as  you are coming down the river or going off the overpass. You can see it  from a mile away easily. Bill   s is around the corner as the plaza goes up  into the town and past a waterfall. It   s really a beautiful site. It covers  about five acres, I think, right on the Tennessee River. And steamboats  come down and look at it every day. People downtown can walk down  into it if they want to. It   s part of the National Park Service, so it   s well  maintained.  I hope I get to see it at some point.  There   s a young fellow over near Locust Grove named Roy Boney  who   s a good graphic novelist. I   ve met him a couple times. As far as I  know, there is nobody else doing stuff about Oklahoma, per se, or about  the region. There were some books done by a guy named Jack Jackson  16  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  down in Texas a few years ago. They were more or less focused on  Texas history. He did one about Quanah Parker. He did one about the  Alamo, the Texas Rangers, different things. I think that   s kind of where  I   m headed with my books right now, doing some of the stories of  Oklahoma. But I   m trying to find stories   I   m definitely not going to do  one about Will Rogers. (Laughter) Okay? Just get that out of your head.  (Laughter) But I want to find some people, do some books about people.  And I   m trying to research them, trying to make them as accurate as I  can. The problem with Oklahoma  is  being Indian Territory, there were  no newspapers. So, records are sparse. When they exist, they   re usually  federal or tribal. And tribal records are mostly lost. Federal records are  difficult to find. They may be filed somewhere in the Smithsonian. I   m  wanting to do stories about people of Oklahoma  that  people have heard  about but they don   t know what they do.    Who was Jesse Chisholm?        Oh yeah, the Chisholm Trail.    That   s all they know about him. And  Jesse Chisholm never dealt cattle. (Laughter)  He was an Indian guy, too. (Laughter)  Yeah, he was an Indian. Ned Christie, everybody   s heard of him, but  exactly what did he do and what happened? Why was he an outlaw?  I want to pick up on that in a bit. In 1990, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act  was passed and it required that artists provide proof of enrollment or be  certified by their tribe. Do you remember how that impacted galleries  and artists?  It was kind of a strange scene for a while. There was some anger and  resentment and jealousy. A lot of emotions came into play at that time,  and nobody was exempt from it.  In other words, no matter how long you   d been identifying as Indian or  doing Indian art. . .  It didn   t really impact at all until the galleries decided they needed to  make sure they were compliant with the law. Now most of the exhibits  and shows are specifically compliant with the law. They may not  mention it anymore, but they try to be that. At that time, because we  were not enrolled, my dad and I went to the Comanche Business  Committee and got a letter that more or less certified me, I guess. It   s  never been tested in court, but it   s sufficed for when I   ve needed it a  couple of times. People don   t like to talk about it. Nobody likes to talk  about and dwell on it. It makes everybody uncomfortable.  Yet it   s an important part of the conditions for producing Indian art.  17  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Yeah, and as you said, a lot of Indians resent the law because nobody  else has to prove that they   re black or that they   re white or that they are  Irish. What does it mean? It   s supposed to be a protection, but at the  same time, it   s a burden  What   s your primary medium when you paint?  Acrylic. But I   m no longer a painter. I   ve pretty much decided I   m not  painting anymore. I   m doing my graphic novels. That   s what I am doing.  I   ll do a painting or a colored picture for the covers. Something that   s  interesting that might be in the future   graphic novels can be done in  full color. As paintings. I saw a lot of that kind of thing when I was in  Europe. Each panel was a small piece of artwork that was painted. And  that   s a possibility.  When was the last painting that you did?  Actually, I   m working on one for my wife right now. (Laughter) It   s a  belated Christmas present.  Those are the best kind. Thinking in terms of your paintings for a  minute   we   ll come back to your graphic novels   how do you think your  style  has  changed over the years? Your style and your use of colors?  When I first started painting   and all artists do this, I see it all the  time   I was trying to paint exactly like somebody whose work I  admired. And it was different people at different times. I tried to paint  like Leonard Riddles for a while. I tried to paint like Rance Hood for a  long time, but I discovered that nobody but Rance Hood could paint  Rance Hood. (Laughter)  Was that an inspiration for some of your action painting? The galloping  horses?  Yeah. I did a show in New York of some of my big, bright action  pictures at one time. The reviewer in the review kept accusing me of  copying Fredric Remington   s style. (Laughter) No, no  I am trying to  copy someone else. (Laughter)  Do you work from photographs?  I work from photographs, yes. When I   m painting, I do that a lot. I do  some paintings specifically to look like a photograph, a painted  photographic image. I have a very good friend, Sam DeVenney   he   s  not the official tribal historian  for the Comanches , but he   s the one  everyone goes to when they want to know something visually because  18  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  he has recorded and been collecting photographs of Comanches for forty  or fifty years.  So you have access to some of those photographs?  Right. He   s a genealogist, too, so he knows who everybody in every  photograph is, and how they   re related to each other. He   s also a  linguist. Whenever you hear Comanche spoken in a Hollywood  production, you can be pretty sure that Sam coached them.  You   ve always done a lot of pen-and-ink drawings. What do you like  about that medium?  The pen and inks? It seems to serve my purpose as a storytelling  medium. It   s quick. I can do a lot of gestures and movement in it, seems  like. It   s more free than painting. I don   t know. I can sit down with  pencil, rough it out, go back with a pen and refine it somewhat, and  catch what I   m trying to put down without spending a whole lot of time  on it.  What   s your creative process from the inception? How  do  you get  ideas?  Well, I like spending a lot of time outdoors, playing, if you want to  know. I have horses. I like to put a saddle on the horse and go for a ride  and pretend that I   m Pistol Pete or Ned Christie or Jesse Chisholm. Or  somebody a long time ago riding across the reservation, going to see his  girlfriend. Anything to get me out of this technological world that we   re  all so caught up in. Everybody. Me, too. I mean, it   s smothering me,  sometimes. And I know it smothers everybody else, even if they don   t  know it. I hope when I draw a picture of some people sleeping out on the  ground or around a campfire or tending their horses, that it looks like I  know what I am talking about. I didn   t get this from a book. You know  what I   m saying?  Your artist bio, I love that you have in there that you were raised by  coyotes.  That   s not strictly true. (Laughter)  Coyote was, for a period, a dominate motif in your work.  He still is. He shows up in some of my books. You have to look for him  sometimes. He   s hidden in the background a little bit.  What do you find intriguing about them?  19  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Coyotes, I have known them since I was a little kid. I remember, when I  couldn   t even talk yet, coyotes were there. I would see them crossing the  road or out in the pasture. Saw dead coyotes hung on the fence post. I  don   t know, I   ve always thought, coyote is just everybody else. He is  just trying to get by.  A survivor?  Right.  Another aspect of your work is the way it expresses sexuality, in a kind  of an exaggerated DC Comic way. Especially your Indian women  characters. I was wondering if you ever caught any flack about that  initially?  Once or twice, so believe it or not, I toned it down. (Laughter) It was a  lot more in your face. And my women   all the women that I do are  pretty sensual. There was an artist named Frank Frazetta, whose work I  really admired. He was a comic strip artist, but he was a great anatomist.  And his women and his men are not thin, they   re husky and voluptuous.  I was offered a job about three or four years ago with a comic book  company out of California. It wasn   t until I had talked to them more  about it, that it turned out to be a pornographic line of graphic novels  they wanted me to draw for. But I turned it down because I would have  ended up in therapy or something, probably.  I think we kind of touched on this but maybe you can expand a little.  Your paintings have a narrative thread. Are you always conscious of  picking up a particular moment out of a chain of events?  Yeah, it   s just like a snap shot. I imagine what happened before and  what happens after. That   s how my books go, too. When I   m doing a  book, I get an idea or I   ll hear about a character and I just know one  snippet of information about him, so I start to research him as much as I  can. Interview people and go to places where he went. I try to do that. If  I know where something happened, I want to go there and see the place  and walk around on it.  I remember seeing a lot of night scenes in your paintings that I always  thought were striking. Are there any special challenges in those?  I like to do the dramatic moonlight, the highlights and stuff. I really  admire that kind of thing in N.C. Wyeth   s work and some of the older  illustrators. Very dramatic contrasts. I like to go riding at night,  20  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  especially if the moon is full or almost full. It   s just a magical time. I see  things that, later, that I don   t know if I really saw or not, but I saw   (Laughs)  As someone who   s a practicing artist, when you find students that say  they want to become professional artists, how do you guide them? What  do you tell them?  I tell my students over and over, the ones who want to listen,    If you  want to be an artist, just do art. And don   t throw your drawings away  because you don   t like them. Keep everything that you do so you can  look at it and see what you feel like you did wrong. And you   ll improve  if you just keep doing it. Everyone has different natural abilities, but  everybody can develop somewhat.    I don   t think I had any natural  ability at drawing, really, but I think I wanted to do it so much. I knew  people in high school who could draw better than I could. I felt like they  were much better drawers. But they didn   t keep doing it, they didn   t  develop it.  One of your most recent graphic novels is based on Ned Christie. I  wonder if you could explain who Ned Christie is and why you got  interested in his story.  Ned Christie was a Cherokee guy from near Stillwell, a place called  Rabbit Trap, which is a little town that   s still there. He was accused of  killing a deputy marshal in 1887, I think it was. Thereafter, he was a  fugitive for five years, although he really was not on the run. He just  went home and held off United States Marshals and reward seekers who  came to get him. For five years. Built a little castle on a hill over there. I  believe it   s been pretty well established now that he was an innocent  man. He kept telling people he was innocent   he didn   t do it. I think it   s  been pretty well proven now that he didn   t do what he was accused of  doing. But he was one of those guys that went to town, got drunk one  night, bad stuff happened. And he was around.  What kind of reception has the book had so far?  The book was real well received by the family. The family loved it. In  fact, I was invited to the Christie family reunion this past summer. It was  a lot of fun. It was a hog fry. It was right there in the vicinity where the  entire Ned Christie story took place. It was half a mile from where all  the shootouts were. All the shootouts were at Ned Christie   s house  because that   s where all the lawmen went. You can see the place from  where the event was. The book is just now getting out into some of the  Cherokee places of business because everything the Cherokees sell has  to be vetted. Some historian has to go through it and make sure it   s on  21  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  the mark and accurate. And that just happened this past summer.  Sounds like one of the challenges of doing graphic novels has been  marketing, just getting it out there.  It is. It   s totally different from marketing individual pieces of art at an  art show. It   s trying to find retailers and so forth, because the more  books I move, the more money I make.  Do you think it   s harder to get publicity for a graphic novel that has an  Indian hero?  A little bit, yes. I   ve had a couple reviews from online people, though,  that have helped, that have Indian sites or Native American sites. But  I   ve had really good reception in libraries. Whenever I   ve done a library  lecture or signing, that   s when I get the best response. Bookstores, not so  much. People don   t even come to them, really. I   m just looking for new  markets, new ways to get it out. I would love to do one that would be  used in public schools to teach Oklahoma history. Oklahoma history,  right now, is possibly the most boring subject you can take in a public  school in Oklahoma. (Laughter) Tell the stories of our Native people. Or  the federal marshals, or the cowboys. Don   t do the Oklahoma musical.  (Laughter) Although, there   s nothing wrong with that. (Laughter)  That would make history so accessible     Yeah, it would. I remember when I was a kid   this was even when I  was in preschool   there was a book you could get in all the Texaco  stations around the country called Texas History Movies. It was these  very little simple stories. Do you remember them? They were very, very  simple, but they told some Oklahoma, but mostly Texas, history, comic-book  style. And anybody could read them. Told stories of what  happened, made it interesting. Gave dialogue to the characters that were  there. It was racist as it could be, but it was a good storytelling medium.  (Laughter) It was entertaining, informative.  How do you balance your teaching and your artwork or work on your  graphic novels at this point? Do you have like a daily or weekly creative  routine?  I teach in the daytime. Then I come home, unwind and go up to my  studio and try to work. (Laughs)  Do you try to work each night a little bit?  Yeah. I keep getting caught up in   I just finished illustrating a coffee  22  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  table book. I did eighty illustrations for a book about the cattle trails  from Oklahoma   from Texas to Montana. The author had worked on  this thing for about eighteen years. I did all of the illustrations for it.  That can be a good source of income can   t it, illustrations?  Yeah, it can. And I   m doing some other things, too. I   m working on a  Little People diorama in one of the casinos. I   m also illustrating a couple  of children   s books for other clients. But every chance I get, I   m  working on my graphic novels. That   s my aim, that   s what I want to do.  As soon as I can quit teaching I am going to do that a lot more.  Looking back on your career, what is one of the pivotal moments that  might have been sort of a fork-in-the-road moment, do you think?  I haven   t recognized any forks if they   ve happened. (Laughter)  It   s all felt like it was supposed to go that way?  No, it didn   t feel like that, either. (Laughter) It was   if I could see life as  a road or trail, it just kind of meanders. I feel like I   m guiding myself a  little bit, but it   s probably all an illusion. I don   t know what   s happening  to me. (Laughter) You know. A friend calls and says,    Why don   t you  move to this town?    or I meet somebody who gets me off on a different  tangent after that. But I   m on this comic book tangent, this graphic novel  thing for the rest of my life. I   m going to do this. This is the thing that  people are going to remember me for, my Oklahoma stories that I   ve  left. But I don   t plan to leave anytime soon. (Laughter)  Up to this point, what   s been one of the highlights?  My time at the Cherokee Nation, when I moved there from Tulsa. It was  the first time I was ever in a community outside of Loco. I was in one in  college for a while, and I was in Tulsa for a while, but when I moved to  Tahlequah, it was almost like I   d come home in some way.  Does Lesa have family down there, too, in Tahlequah?  No, her family   s in Osage County. The time I spent there, I was able to  do some   there   s a writer over there that I became friends with. His  name was Robert Conley. He actually wrote some comic strips that I did   drawings of  for the Cherokee newspaper while I was working there.  Eventually, though, they got to be too abrasive and far out, so the  newspaper wouldn   t run them anymore. (Laughter)  Censored again.  23  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Yeah. He was doing contemporary stories of Cherokees. Strangely  enough, Indians, generally, I   ve found (make what you want of this)  don   t like to be portrayed in comic books. You know what I   m saying?  Because of the stigma the comic books have. Comic books are still just  for kids      And  Stereotypes?  Stereotypes and all that. I have done a couple of underground Indian  comics. Some Indians like them and some of them burned them,  probably.  You might be able to turn that around. What has been one of the low  points for you?  Low points, geez. I lost my job here in Morris for a while, for about  three years, because of federal funding.  That   s a big chunk of time.  Yeah. Lesa and I had bought a place already at this time. We thought we  were going to lose it and it got very thin. We scrimped and did anything  we could. I drove trucks for hay haulers. Just anything I could do for a  while. We had a little girl at the time. Sadly, she kind of grew up poor.  (Laughter) We   ve recovered since then. And all the other stresses that  come with that. Personal relationships.  Is there anything that we haven   t talked about that you would like to  cover?  I don   t know. Do you want me to tell a story? (Laughter)  I actually do want you to tell stories about a couple of your paintings.  Would you talk about this piece?  What   s the title?   I always put my titles on the back. (Laughs) This one is called    Pepsi-  Cola Cowboy.    It   s one of a series I did using logos, Americana logos.  Putting them in a Southwest regional type of look, because that   s one of  the things I remember as kid. You couldn   t go into any store or gas  station without seeing Coca-Cola and/or Pepsi-Cola and several other  different drinks. They were just part of the landscape. They were painted  on walls everywhere. My father was a sign painter and he did a lot of  that kind of stuff. So, I saw it being created and then I looked at it for  years and years afterward. And it   s still there. That whole landscape is  kind of a small-town look. And it   s slowly fading, it   s falling apart. The  24  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  buildings are being demolished. And we have different logos now. But  these are the ones that stick with me. You can call it commercialism, if  you want to, but it   s just a part of what made America what America is.  And Western Oklahoma what it is.  When I was a kid, it really was not uncommon for people to ride their  horses into town. Kids would ride horses to go see their friends. At  rodeos, especially, you would see people dressed up like this guy. You  still do see people. In those days it was less of a weekend activity and  more of a general part of life, to live that way.  What do you have here?  This is an illustration from a children   s book that I was going to do. It  was never published. It   s a painting. I did a series of paintings for all the  illustrations. This was a story called Brown Boy and Freckles. It  was their cross-country adventure one summer, one summer time, and  the adventures they encountered.  Being chased by a bull?  They went through the wrong pasture. They weren   t supposed to go  through that pasture. There was a bad bull in there. I gave the painting to  my grandson because he really liked it.  Is it still his painting?  It   s still his painting, yes. He   s kind of outgrown it, now. He   s in  college, so    (Laughs)  He   ll be coming back to it. (Laughs) I guess this one has the title on the  bottom.  Yes, this one was a piece I did as an invitation piece for a show called     Cowboy   s Song.    It was put on by a fellow named Austin Realrider in  Pawnee several years ago. Austin had a gallery. He was also organizing  some Wild West shows that were going on at the time. He wanted the  whole show have real cowboy and Indian flavor. All he gave me was the  title and told me to do a picture to go with it.  Wild West shows. You mean performances outdoors?  Right. Austin lived near where Pawnee Bill had a Wild West show for  years, back at the turn of the century. For a few years, Austin was  promoting some of those shows. Newer shows that were kind of  25  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  reproductions of Pawnee Bill, Buffalo Bill, that kind of thing.  But run by Indians this time. (Laughter) Run by Austin, anyway.  Yes. (Laughter)  This is one of your illustrations. Tell us what book it   s from, but also,  maybe, talk to us a bit about the process you use which is a little  different from most graphic illustrators.  This is a work in progress. The working title of this one is    Medicine  Lodge.    And it   s the story of Jesse Chisholm. This is my next graphic  novel. It tells the story about this real person, because I   ve never had any  real training as a graphic novelist. I   m kind of making up the process as I  go along. I draw the drawings approximately three times as large as  they   re going to appear in the book itself. They   re reduced. So far, all I  have done is black and white. That   s the medium I like to work in. I may  go to some color later on, but right now this is what I want to do.  They   re fun to draw. I like the spontaneity of it. I can just more or less  sit down with a pencil and start drawing and sketching things out. As  soon as I get it more or less looking like I want it to, I take a black pen  and start inking it.  I wonder if you can read that to us?    Season in, season out. To track a  critter is to know him, stepping in his very footprints.     Some of my pages are not actually dialogue. I use sort of a hybrid poetry  as a narrative for some of the places where people are not talking. I want  the characters to express themselves in dialogue, but there are certain  events and time periods that can be better expressed with a kind of a  flowing narrative that goes, more or less, with the picture. The picture  and the words should show two sides of the same narrative. That   s what  I am trying to do.  Give two different sets of information     Right. I think a lot of that was influenced by Lance Henson, who is the  poet that I   ve talked about. I really like his poetry. Lance and I are  probably going to collaborate on some things. I   ve done illustrations for  his books of poetry before. Those were black and white things, also. In  fact, my first published work was with Lance. I did some illustrations in  the college publication, back in the Oklahoma College of Liberal Arts in  Chickasha.  Do graphic novels require a lot of research?  26  McMurtry  Little Thunder  McMurtry  Little Thunder  They do. (Laughs)  You   ve said the kind of research you like to do is on-site?  Yes, I need to go to the places where all these things take place, if I  possibly can, if I know where they are. I want to find out, what kind of  clothes did they wear? What kind of house did they live in? So many of  the westerns we grew up with as children were completely, totally  inaccurate and unreal that people have a skewed idea of the way people  lived. And I want to show the harshness of it, the dirtiness of it. You  don   t hear in the movies, or it   s never really referred to, you were lucky  if you got to take a bath once a month, probably. And you know  anywhere there were a lot of horses, there was a lot of horse shit. And I  want to try to convey that in my novels a little. The grittiness of it.   Well thank you for visiting with me today.   -------  -------
