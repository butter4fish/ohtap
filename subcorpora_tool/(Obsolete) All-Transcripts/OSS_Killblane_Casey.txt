 Nykolaiszyn Today is Monday, February 8, 2016. My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn (also  with me is Anna McDougal) with the OSU library. Today we   re in Davis,  Oklahoma, Murray County, interviewing Casey Killblane as part of our  Cowboys in Every County Oral History Project. Thank you for sitting down  with us today. We really appreciate it.  Killblane Thank you.  Nykolaiszyn Casey, let   s begin and learn a little bit more about you. Could you tell us the  year you were born and where you were born?  Killblane I was born in 1962 and born in Sulphur, Oklahoma, which is in Murray  County.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your parents.  Killblane Both parents graduated from Davis Public Schools here. We have been here  for quite some time. My father moved here in 1949 and bought the ranch  that we   re on now, and my mother was born and raised here. They were high  school sweethearts, graduated from Davis, and Dad continued ranching.  They married and started their family. We   ve just been here the entire time.  I was away for about twelve years total, and then we   ve moved back after I  was married in    96 and came back to Murray County.  Nykolaiszyn As you were growing up as a little girl, you lived on the ranch. Tell me  about life on the ranch.  Killblane It was wonderful. My dad and my uncle both owned the ranch together. It  was the Healey Brothers Flying L Ranch, and we raised Herefords,  registered Hereford cattle. I grew up knowing about cattle and showing  some cattle. We never got real into it. We did just county-level stuff, but I  had five cousins who lived across the way from us, still here on the ranch,  and two older brothers. There were only two girls, the oldest child in their  family, and I was the youngest in my family. The girls couched everybody  5  in, but we really thought we were boys the whole time. It was a great way to  grow up. Our school in Davis was small. We got to do a little bit of  everything. You could play basketball, be a cheerleader, be in the band, be  in the math club, be in home ec. You just could do everything. Probably I  was good at most things but not an expert at anything because we didn   t  have to focus. We had a lot of fun. The family worked together. We always  worked in the summers. The boys would haul hay. I said occasionally I  helped by driving the truck as the hay bales would come up. Certainly hay  production has changed since our years. One of the big memories growing  up was a long time ago, back in the    70s, it was legal to have college  football players work. You could hire them for the summer, and this was  before football training went an entire year. You never got a break. Being  supporters of OSU, my dad and uncle in ag and all, and my uncle had gone  to OSU.  My father did not, but they were able to get football players and hire two.  The first year, they were living over at Turner Falls  Park  in these little  cabins. They were horrible. I mean, I don   t even know if they had running  water. Dad was asking them where they were and all of this stuff, and we  had an extra room down in the basement. Tommy  Noles  and Wayne   Hallmark  came and lived in the basement that first summer, and oh my  gosh, I was in second grade. Life was good, these two college boys, and they  were kind to us and fun with us. When we   d get off work, they would play  football with us. At least, that   s what we called it. They would go out and  throw footballs, and of course, we just thought life was great. I was the all-time  center because all the boys got to play everything else, and my  grandmother was a huge football supporter for and loved OSU football.  They called her Granny, everybody did, and we got t-shirts. She made  jerseys for us that said    Tommy   s Tigers    because Tommy Noles was the  center at the time, and this had to be 1972, I think. He was the starting  center. We were Tommy   s Tigers, and all had a matching jersey with  numbers. I was the center. That was my role in life was to do that, but it was  fun. It made going to the games, which we have gone to football games  since I was in second grade. I enjoyed our old stadium. I love the new  stadium, but there were just a lot of memories that revolved around summers  and work. OSU was always intermingled with that.  Nykolaiszyn As a little girl, you were able to travel to Stillwater and visit campus.  Killblane Oh yeah.  Nykolaiszyn What was that like for you?  Killblane Lots of fun, and of course, we would always go, back then, games always  started at one-thirty. I mean, we knew what we were doing. We had to be up  and on our way by nine-thirty, ten o   clock. Younger, I don   t have a lot of  6  these long-term drives that I remember, but as I got into junior high and high  school (if there was a game, we were there, rain, snow, sleet, whatever),  probably at that time or a little before, my uncle actually sat on the Board of  Regents for Oklahoma State. When they first came in and made the box  seating down outside, we were able to get boxes there, and there was eight  and eight, sixteen of us. We were all together and still are in those same  seats to this day. We would all herd in and all herd out, but we would all go  up and sit during the games. The drive up would be long. When we finally  got into high school and my brothers were both playing high school football  and all of this, we would take our RV, and we would drive the RV up.  Everybody would sleep. The boys would sleep because they just played a  high school football game the night before. I didn   t understand the value of  that until we had our own children and we were doing it, but it was a  wonderful thing that we went to Stillwater on Saturdays. They didn   t have  anything to complain about or to be bored with on Saturday night because     Well, I   m in Davis. There   s nothing to do. I   m going to go get in trouble.     This was just what we did. It was our family thing, me growing up, and it  was certainly the boys    family thing that we would go to OSU football  games.  When they wanted to complain, we   d go,    Really? There   s probably some  people who would like to do this.    We were able to bring friends along.  They   ve enjoyed it, but we did that. That was just part of growing up. We   d  go up. We   d eat in the O-Club, and it was a buffet. Sometimes you   re, as a  kid, would have much preferred Eskimo Joe   s. It wasn   t even food-oriented  then. That was so long ago, but we always had to eat in the O-Club, go  through the buffet. Then after the games, we   d go over and wait outside the  locker room to see Tommy and Wayne and Jay  Cruse , and the years that  followed, the different football players, but the boys would get to go in the  locker room. Of course, I never did, but Tommy would come out and see us  all and give us all hugs. Then we   d leave and make the trek back, sometimes  stopping in Oklahoma City for dinner but a lot of times just bee-lining it  home. The drive seemed a lot longer then. I guess maybe an increased speed  limit makes it a little shorter. Driving to school was always, the entire road  all the way up to Highway 51 goes fast, but from 51 into Stillwater, I think,  is the longest drive ever. Still to this day, I   m like,    Okay, we   re almost  there.    You   re going,    When is it going to end? When is it going to end?     Lots of those memories continue, and it   s fun when you finally crest the hill.  You see the dorms on the horizon, and you know you really are getting  close. That brings back a lot of memories, childhood memories when we do  that as we   re going up now.  Nykolaiszyn You mentioned that you were quite involved in Davis High School. You were  able to participate in a lot of activities. Were you drawn to one particular  subject over another?  7  Killblane Probably if extracurricular is a subject. (Laughter) Between basketball,  track, cheerleading, band, loved math, I mean, but I   m not sure it wasn   t  because of the teacher. But there wasn   t a real   probably numbers was  always something that I enjoyed and then later majored in finance with a  minor in accounting. It was more about the social and the extracurricular  activities that we had. My dad had always loved track, so I was his track  star. My middle brother did pole vault. He did quite well, but I was the  runner. Spring would come around, and we really, after basketball season,  got into track. That was a lot of fun.  Nykolaiszyn When you   re younger and you   re growing up, did you have any idea of what  you wanted to be when you got older?  Killblane I didn   t see this. Well, I guess I did in some degree. I thought I wanted to be  a mom, but I can remember playing in my closet, sounds like I was a  mistreated child or something. I had a shelf in my closet, and I can  remember going in there and pretending that I was somebody   s  administrative assistant, secretary. I had a polka-dotted wallpaper. Those  were my intercom buttons for a telephone, and I mean, I can remember  vividly doing this. Maybe it prepared me for when I was with Mrs. Bush and  helped her, but I just always wanted to keep someone on track and keep  someone on schedule. I think probably my children and my husband wish I  didn   t do that as much, but I think as I got older, I enjoyed when our  accountants were around and, again, numbers. I was drawn to that and  started down that path in college and then flopped real quick my senior year  going,    Hmm, I think I   m going to do finance, not accounting,    silly  because I do more accounting today than I do probably finance, but it was  good background and helped me get to some different places.  Nykolaiszyn How did you choose OSU for your undergraduate career?  Killblane It was really a difficult process because both brothers had graduated, and  again, we   d been going to games since second grade, seeing everything  there. We bled orange. At that time in Murray County, probably our two  families were the only ones. I wore an OSU stocking cap to school, and kids  made fun of it and called it stinky. They would throw it around. I mean,  vividly (obviously, it scarred me), I remember this, okay, and it was back  when we were burnt orange, not our wonderful orange. I like this orange so  much better. I just always thought that that   s what I   d do. Both boys went to  OSU, and that was great. I had cousins. Everybody was going. It got time  for me to graduate, and my mom seriously was saying,    Really, Norman   s a  lot closer. We could have lunch,    I mean, because we were very, very close.  Two hours away, you   re not popping up for lunch. Although, as a mother, I  have no problem popping up for lunch if I need to. (Laughter) The distance  has shrunk. We really were talking about it, and finally, Dad stepped in. He  goes,    You need to understand something,    and I go,    Okay.    My father, I  8  mean, any dream I had, he would have made sure I had the resources to do  whatever. He goes,    You can go to any school you want, any school, but I  will only write a check to OSU. You need to check your savings account,  and then we   ll go from there.    I went to Mom. I go,    Going to OSU.     (Laughter)    We will not be having lunch in Norman, okay?    (Laughter) I  guess probably it was nice because there was no decisions to be made. It  made it easy. I was perfectly happy to do it, but he was dead serious. He  would not be writing a check to anywhere but one that said OSU.  Nykolaiszyn There we go. Freshman year, you   re getting ready to start. How do you get  from Davis to Stillwater?  Killblane Oh, that was interesting, and today, I look back on it and go,    Mom, you just  let me go.    Today, we take them to school. We do all of these things, and  I   m like,    Holy mackerel. I loaded my car here, and I drove to Stillwater all  by myself.    I moved into the dorm all by myself. I mean, I truly did, and I   m  going,    Oh wow.    I was all excited about it, but Mom and Dad hadn   t gone  to college. They didn   t know that. I don   t know. I don   t remember seeing a  lot of people. When it was time to enroll, a friend of mine from high school  who was actually a year older than me who had gone to OU  University of  Oklahoma  went with me to OSU to enroll. I mean, there were no, nothing  that I knew of like they do today,    Come in, and let   s do an orientation, your  parents come so they understand.    I mean, that aspect of what   s changed is  wonderful, especially for a parent and especially for parents if they hadn   t  been down that road before. I think it   s very, very helpful to see, but picking  out my major, picking out my classes, I just did it.  There was no thought that there was any long-term effects of what it is,  whereas with the boys today, I   m like,    Oh, no, no, no, no, you have four  years. You need to really look at that degree sheet, and you need to  understand. We   re not messing around here because four years, the  Killblane scholarship ends, okay? That fifth year is on you, okay?     (Laughter) It was interesting, and as I look back, I   m going,    You all had a  lot of faith in me that I don   t know why you did.    I was leaving and going,  but brothers were there. I   m sure that that was somewhat of a comfort. I  remember I would park my car at my brother   s house. He   s four years older.  He should have already graduated, but he was on that five-year plan, maybe  the six-year plan. I can   t remember now. He was around, and I would park  my car there because we had overflow parking and couldn   t park by the  dorm. He was there to help, but truly, a friend just, we drove up. She   s  going,    Okay, now we get in this line because I   m sure it   s like what it is at  OU,    and we   re going through this book, picking out. I mean, they certainly  have made it much, much better in today   s enrolling that we went through  with the boys than how we did it.  Nykolaiszyn You started in 1980?  9  Killblane Started in 1980, yes, yes, graduated in    80, and that fall was my freshman  year.  Nykolaiszyn What were you driving?  Killblane Oh, the best car in the whole wide world, I had a Datsun 280ZX, and I got  that because I had won the hurdles in track. I was a three-time all-state  champion my junior and senior year in the eighty-yard low hurdles, and my  senior year, in the 440. We called them 440-yards and eighty-yards. We  were still in the yards. My dad had always said, and he was announcing this  primarily to the boys being athletes, said,    If you   re a two-time all-stater, I   ll  get you whatever car.    This was his carrot that he threw out there. My senior  year came around. I won, my junior year, first. I came back, repeated in the  hurdles, and then also ran in the 440. I didn   t say anything, but the guys at  the coffee shop reminded Dad that this was what his promise was. I get  started just giving him a hard time, and it had been my dream. It was blue  with the silver, two-tone blue and silver with T-tops. You could take the T-tops  off, and it was five-speed. I could just go. Oh, it was just this hatchback  on the back, and it was just an incredibly wonderful car. I drive up. I   d been  in town and was with some family and their young children.  Actually, I was jumping on a trampoline. How I remember that, I don   t  know. Mom finally, before cellphones, it   s hard to believe, but yes, they  called on a landline to the Moores and said,    Is Casey there?       Yeah.        Would you ask her to get some butter and come on home?    and I   m like,     Okay. I guess I got to quit playing with this young child    that I was  jumping on the trampoline with. I went to the grocery store and drove home,  and for some reason, I   m trying to remember if I actually drove into the  garage. I had a little blue Chevy Chevette, and the house was two-story. I  was getting ready to pull into the garage, and when I opened up the door,  here sat this car. It had a big bow on it and a big sign, and of course, my  parents are coming down through the basement and my brothers there all  looking out the door to see what my response is. I see it. Well, the note on  the car was,    Congratulations, three-time all-state   ,    and then Mom writes,        and making straight-As    because that was her caveat.  I had pulled a four-point my senior year, always had As and Bs, but the little  extra effort and I made all As. That was my car, but Dad, before I got in it,  he said,    Okay, here   s the rule. You will not drive over sixty and you will  wear your seatbelt, or the car   s mine.    I go,    Okay.    Now this is before  seatbelts were mandatory. Nobody wore a seatbelt, and it was a Datsun  280ZX with a five-speed. Here I was.    Okay, I   m going to have to       and  truly, as long as I had that car, I obeyed those rules. I mean, I really did,  which just, I thought, finally, at some point, maybe at age twenty-two, I  might not, and this was when the speed limit was fifty-five. He was at least  10  letting me go sixty. I could at least break the law a little bit. (Laughter) My  brother   s home, and he   s going to ride in the car with me. I   ve had it about a  week, and I get in. We head to town. As you drove out, you know the curvy  road. This is exactly the road that we drove every day, and I could drive all  the way at sixty and never touch my brakes.  I mean, that was my fun. That was my thrill. It was a racecar. We get  started, and I go through those five gears. I went sixty leaving, and Clay  would go,    What are you doing?    because I was going through it all and  then at sixty, slow down and stay at sixty. He goes,    What are you doing?    I  go,    Well, I can   t drive over sixty.    He goes,    You are kidding me.    He gets  home, and he   s telling Mom and Dad,    Okay, now that   s just retarded. I  mean, why would you do that? Okay, she gets to sixty in two seconds, and  then she doesn   t drive   .    He goes,    What are you talking about?    I said,     You did not say how fast I had to get to sixty or how slowly I had to do  that.    That was my big excitement with my car is I could get there fast, and I  could go, without ever touching my break, at sixty all the way home.  Unfortunately, I probably still do that in a Tahoe. That   s probably not a  good thing, doesn   t hug the ground quite as well, but I still can come  through those curves pretty well. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn When you rolled into Stillwater with your car, what was your residence  hall? Where did you live?  Killblane I lived in Wentz Hall.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me about your experience at Wentz.  Killblane Scott-Parker-Wentz, Scott and Parker were the boys    dorms, and Wentz was  the higher rise. It was where I lived. I was on the sixth floor, the room right  off the elevator. I went potluck. I didn   t know who my roommate was. I  knew I was going through rush. I knew that I would live in the dorm one  year and then move into a house, hopefully. I was very naive about rush at  that point, too, which was probably a very great, god, thing that you didn   t  know what you were getting ready to embark on. I mean, I truly did love it,  and there was a lot of history. My great-great-uncle was Lou Wentz, who  the dorm was named after, and I was desperate to live in this dorm, not that I  ever knew him. He passed away long before I was ever a twinkle in  anybody   s eye, but the history and the heritage and the family certainly  holds a lot of fond memories.  Really, he raised my dad and uncle. That was fun to get to be there and see,  roommate was fabulous, Lisa Gore. We actually, for many years, did not  connect and have just reconnected in the last couple of years thanks to  Facebook, I   m sure. That has helped us to reconnect. We   re exchanging  Christmas cards once again. She was not in the Greek system. Our worlds  11  just passed at night, but there were some fun things that we did in the dorm.  The food was tolerable, I mean, probably like cafeteria food, whatever, but  there was a piano down in the basement where we did our laundry. I had  taken piano my entire life. At one point, I think, I had three or four piano  lessons in a week because I couldn   t sight-read, and my father wanted me to  play something other than Beethoven, something that he could enjoy.  Of course, I never quite mastered it. We tried effort, but there was a piano  downstairs. I can remember, probably, looking back, when I was getting  homesick. I would do laundry, and I   d go down there. I had two or three  songs.    Somewhere Over the Rainbow,       Heart and Soul,    and    Brian   s  Song    were my three songs, other than contest pieces, that I was not going  to play any longer. Those were always my go-to. I would get down there,  and I   d play sometimes and then even once in the sorority house. I would go  down, and everybody   d go,    Oh, Casey   s homesick. She   s playing the piano  again.    (Laughs) It was a neat time to be away and yet not   we didn   t have  a lot of responsibility. I mean, how much do you have to do out there? Of  course, we all had to go get phone lines. You had to get telephones. Every  time you moved, you had to go change your phones, and you lined up over  in Kerr-Drummond.  You   d go through the AT T phone line and get,    This is where I   m going  to be living.    I don   t know how they kept track of it all or kept track of us,  but everybody had to go get phones. It was a wild day, but great memories.  Right off that elevator, that   s where I was. Community bathroom was an  interesting concept, but you didn   t have to clean it. That was okay, too. That  made it a little easier, but we didn   t decorate the room like they do today. So  many girls when they   ve gone in, I mean, they   ve planned out their  matching bedspreads, and I   m like,    Oh, no, no, I just moved in.    I had a  stereo, a turntable with big LP records. That was the big thing that you  always took with you. That was our big technology at that moment. It was  fun. You learned the less you take, the less you have to haul up and down  stairs. Through the years, what I took to school kept shrinking. Only the  necessities are what went back and forth.  Nykolaiszyn What were you listening to?  Killblane Let   s see, Dan Fogelberg, Earth, Wind   Fire (Who were the others?),  Kansas, Barry Manilow. I know. I would then go into that Rod Stewart.  There was a whole plethora of it.  Nykolaiszyn Well, tell me about rush.  Killblane A blast, I don   t think I ever had so much fun, but as I said, I had no clue  what was going on on the other side. I mean, it never occurred to me, never  occurred to me that someone would say,    You   re not invited back.    I mean,  12  I was just totally naive to this whole concept. I actually, just that summer,  had volunteered and was a page at the Republican National Convention in  Detroit, and I had tons to talk about. That, of course, was on the resume, and  they had all seen the resume. I had no idea they had looked at the resume for  months before I ever got there. They knew stuff about me, and it never  clicked. I was just,    Great to see everybody,    and we would sit and talk. Of  course, you got your story down because I wasn   t in the same house.  Thirteen houses is what we had, and you walked to all thirteen. We wore  little short skirts with sandals, and then you dressed up a little more. Then  you dressed up a little more, and I had a cousin who was a  Kappa Alpha   Theta. I had a cousin who was a Chi-O mega , both older.  The Theta was actually the cousin that I grew up on the ranch with. She was  ten years older than me, and the Chi-O was only four years older. I had  actually been to the Chi-O house. It ended up coming down to Pi  Beta  Phi  and Chi-O, and my grandmother had been a Pi  Beta  Phi. I truly knew that  it would mean a lot to her to do that, not that she grew up singing songs to  me, I mean, none of that. I just knew that it was, but on the last night, my  cousin actually was at the Chi-O house. We had the last one. You go to the  two-party. We did two-party, not three-party. She was there, and she handed  me my cake. I was like,    Oh, what do I do?    I was so distraught, so  distraught, probably the biggest decision I was having to make. In hindsight,  it wasn   t, but anyway, you think it   s the end of the world. My poor, poor  floor monitor, I mean, she was just so, I go,    Just let me call my brother. Let  him come stand out the window. Let me talk to him.    She goes,    No, you  cannot do that.    I go,    Oh please.    You couldn   t talk. I mean, from when  you went into rush until the end, there was no communication with the  outside.  Nykolaiszyn Really?  Killblane Yeah. Now they all get to have their phones. After you send in your card,  you can talk to anybody or do anything. That was it. Boom, you were  finished, and I just remember thinking,    Oh, I don   t want to hurt Karen   s  feelings. I don   t want to hurt Granny   s feelings.    It didn   t get to where I  thought I would fit the   I mean, I was going to be happy wherever. I knew I  could be. Anyway, I chose Pi  Beta  Phi, and it all worked out. I mean,  literally, as soon as they said,    When you wake up, you can leave. You can  check out,    I woke up at probably five o   clock. I mean, it was so early, and I  packed my bags. I was out of there and at my brother   s house, which was  behind, well, actually, one of those little places they tore down to build the  new practice field. It was over in that condemned area.  Nykolaiszyn Yes.  13  Killblane I think he lived in one of those houses. I snuck over there real early. Well,  my cousin had stayed there with him. I   m like,    Oh God, now I   m going to  have to   .    Of course, at the point, I didn   t know which one I would get. I  had made the preference of Pi  Beta  Phi, but I had to match up on their list.  I didn   t know a legacy gave you a little bit of credit, little did I know, again,  totally naive. I got into his house and snuck in. Everybody was still in bed,  and I woke Colt up. I said,    I got to talk to you.    I   m jumping in bed with  him, talking to him, the shoes still on. We   re sitting here. He goes,    What   d  you do? What   d you do?    and I said,    Well, I preffed Pi  Beta  Phi.    He  goes,    Okay, good, good, good.    I mean, he was happy. Everybody was  happy, but finally, when I woke up, I told Karen. Then I exited out and left,  but it was great. It was the best decision for me, and it was such a pleasure.  My Granny was so excited. Actually, initiation, which was in that January,  she got out of the hospital to come to initiation and pin her pin on me. It was  the right choice. It was definitely the right choice.  Nykolaiszyn Well, since we   re talking about where you were living, you moved into the  house. Tell me about that experience.  Killblane Oh, quite fun when you live with sixty to eighty other women, and of  course, growing up with only boys, I was never one for a lot of, take time. I  got dressed for my proms in thirty minutes because we had a track meet,  okay, and you had to race back. I never did any of this stuff. I think I was an  easy roommate other than being goofy and silly and always doing something  and always wanting music on. It was fun, and it was a great experience  because you really do get to know people when you live together. You  understand that it can   t always be your way, that there   s a give and take  when you have a roommate. It   s a great preparation for when you go get  married because you   ve got to learn that not everybody   s just like you, and  if putting your socks on the floor bugs somebody, you probably shouldn   t do  it. Is it going to really hurt you to think about somebody else? That was a  great thing because I had my room always to myself. I had two older  brothers. I got to have my own room. That was very, very good in that  sense.  The comradery was great. In every house, you find people that you   re  extremely close to and then people that you   re acquainted with, that you  have a bond but they   re not your best running buddies. Following high  school, I was in every athletic game that we had and participated in, from  football, we ran the wishbone when we had Pi  Beta  Phi right, option right  and Pi  Beta  Phi left, option left. We were quite into our intramural football  and really took it very serious, and it came down to always against Thetas.  We   d win. They   d win. We   d win. I mean, it was quite the rival for many,  many years that we were there, but I played volleyball for the first time. I  think they tried to get me to play Ping-Pong once and realized that was not  my strong suit. We were there and then loved the shows. The shows were all  14  fun and got to do that, which was certainly nothing I had the experience in  high school to do. That was a lot of fun and could always sing a harmony  part, didn   t want me for a solo, but I can do a harmony any time. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Did you do Freshman Follies or Spring Sing, both?  Killblane Oh, all of it, yeah, yeah, but Freshman Follies was the first soiree into it. We  were horrible, horrible. I mean, we made the show, but oh my gosh, I mean,  to this day, when we all get together, we go,    Why did they let us do those  dances?    I mean, we were making up our own dances then. We had no clue  what the show was, but we did not have cheesing, thank you.  Nykolaiszyn Explain to me what that is.  Killblane Cheesing is the most retarded thing you   ve ever seen in your life because  they go, and they move this entire time. They have this exasperated grin on  their face, and apparently you   re not allowed to be still the entire time  you   re on stage. When you go from song to song, you do this cheesing  thing, and you have to bend and stand and do, I mean, it   s exhausting. The  first time we went up to see it, as a person watching and not understanding  it, you   re exhausted watching them because it never stops. You go to  intermission, and you just go,    Oh, thank you.    Then when our first got into  it, we had to go because he was in it, although I   m going,    Mom didn   t  come up for Freshman Follies. Why do we think we have to do this?    It was  our excuse to go to Stillwater. I mean, that   s why we have to do it, okay?  (Laughs) We would go. It was a little better the second time you see it. At  least you   re prepared to watch what   s going on, and as soon as he  performed, we bolted. Then Paxton just went through it last year. He   s a  sophomore this year, and again, we were a little more prepared. We actually  took friends with us and my mother, Granny Sue, and let them experience it  for the first time. It was fun to make somebody else go through that.  We had warned them,    Look, just know they never stop,    but the talent has  increased enormously from what we had. It   s a whole new level of what we  are. We were a bunch of high school kids that really, we were horrible in  Freshman Follies. Now we got better. We got better with Spring Sing. That  was always fun, but we stood still in Spring Sing. I mean, it just has really  changed. I haven   t seen VR. I don   t know how it has escalated, but it has to  have, I mean, just the quality of talent. I mean, Freshman Follies, they   re  throwing girls nine miles in the air, and I   m going,    Oh please, please don   t  drop anybody, okay, please?    (Laughter) The most we did was lean on the  guy and stand back up. I mean, that was our big stunt or a hip stand, very,  very nominal thing, maybe a shoulder sit, I mean, only one or two of the  tiniest people. It changed enormously, but it was fun. It was through those  things that you really did meet other people, and you got closer with the  people in your own house and fraternity and sorority because you   re  15  practicing every night. Some of the people that weren   t playing football or  basketball, whatever sporting thing, were in the shows. I got both worlds,  and it was a lot of fun.  Nykolaiszyn Do you remember your house mother?  Killblane Oh, Mom Ernest, yes, she was precious. She was wonderful. She just was  the epitome of a very kind but stern, I mean, she wasn   t going to let us  misbehave. We were always polite. We had formal dinner. When you  walked in with Mom Ernest, you were going to sit at the table. We   d wear  our knee-highs. We were supposed to be in stockings, but skirts were longer.  We could wear knee-highs, and we learned that one very quick and could be  a skirt pulled up over the basketball shorts and put on a sweater real quick.  You were ready for formal dinner. I mean, just because your hair was dirty  and you didn   t look very good, it didn   t matter. We had on dress and hose,  okay? That was the requirement, but it was nice. We sang a lot. We had a  reunion not too long ago, and some of the collegiates were there.  They were going,    Oh my gosh.    I go,    We woke up singing. We went to  chapter singing. We went to dinner singing. We went to bed singing, and  there was harmony the whole time. We made it up. Even if it wasn   t there,  we made up harmony.    It was a lot of fun that we did, I   m sure they have  things that they will look back now that are very special, but we think  they   ve lost it by not singing as much. Mom Ernest was just very special.  She had a very kind heart. Her door was always open. We   d do silly things,  and she was always a part of rush with us. I always thought,    That really  stinks that she doesn   t get to go to chapter with us,    but then really, on her  side, I   m sure she was very glad she didn   t have to go to chapter, that she  got to shut down on Monday nights or do something else. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about Homecoming.  Killblane Oh, wonderful, wonderful memories, great relationships, lots of  engagements. I mean, usually there was a romance that erupted somewhere  because of Homecoming from friends and everybody, and you go,    Oh, you  met at Homecoming?    and everything. I always thought I would, but I never  did. By the time you   re a senior, you   ve pomped enough that you don   t feel  like you really need to do that, and you just go over to socialize. All the  seniors and all the senior girls and guys are just there to observe and watch,  and I think that   s probably one thing that hasn   t changed, watching what my  son did this past year as a senior and hearing,    Well, none of the girls come  as seniors.    I go,    Of course not. Why would you?    I mean, come on. The  underclassmen are the one who have the pomping hours, and of course a  driving force, why you get in Freshman Follies is because then your  pomping is reduced. I don   t recall that quite as much.  16  Nykolaiszyn How do you think your house decks compared in the    80s to today?  Killblane We did not have micropomping. We did not have the facial, the detail, I  mean, how incredible that it is. Of course, I   m biased now. I was biased  then. AGR  Alpha Gamma Rho  always has the incredible engineering, and  they seem to dream up something. Then the next year, everybody   s doing  that thing. The cylinder turning was Trevor   s freshman year, and then the  next year every, it   s fun to watch that happen. We did Homecoming with  AGR our senior year, and we won it all. Of course, we were always quite  excited about that. I think the pomping is probably the biggest change that  I   ve seen, size seems to be the same, I think. Maybe it   s a little different.  The engineering has beefed up a little bit. You can go, on one hand,    Oh, do  we really need to spend that much money on this?    On the other hand, it is  such a great experience. Yeah, yeah, the money needs to be spent, and they  need to do it because there   s so much more to college than just your  education.  If it   s just a diploma you   re looking for, you can get that online these days,  but there   s a whole college experience. That   s important to learn how to  socialize, how to be a part of something, how to be a part of a team, not only  just your individual little group but a team of the entire college, and it builds  pride. I mean, I think there   s a lot to be said for being excited about OSU,  and Homecoming transcends that for many, many. If I were doing it again, I  would probably try to be involved in the college steering committee, the  overall, and I just never did that. We were more into the games that you  played, the signed posters, and I will say we didn   t have the philanthropic  emphasis probably in anything really. I mean, we were just cruising along.  We won all the university football championship for Pi  Beta  Phi. It seems  like there   s a lot more emphasis on the philanthropy side, which is good,  which is good. Hopefully, it   s teaching young people to think beyond their  own squares and how to help and how to contribute.  Nykolaiszyn Well, we talked about a little of the fun you had. Let   s talk about the  academics.  Killblane Academics. College of Business, started out in accounting, I thought it was  going to be a great profession, and we all talked about it, Dad, everybody.  You can always hang your shingle. It would be a wonderful tool to have,  and I love numbers. I really did, probably did not take it serious enough my  freshman year in those basic classes, and as I progressed through, I was like,     Why am I really doing this? Why am I really doing this?    So, junior year,  completed. I literally had three accounting classes to take my senior year,  went to summer school that summer in Stillwater, which was a blast, quite  fun, almost as much fun as summer school in Hawaii after my sophomore  year, but that   s another story. I took a finance class and really thought that  that was what I wanted to change to, and I had to fess up and tell my dad  17  that I thought I wanted to go to finance, which meant I had six finance  classes in one year versus only three and a whole lot of fun classes to take.  My senior year, I took all my finance and graduated with a degree in  finance. Then I guess I went into politics and hotel and restaurant, I mean,  didn   t follow that path at all, but it served well. I mean, it   s one of those  things that has served through a plethora of activity.  Nykolaiszyn Any professors that come to mind that really stick out for you?  Killblane Oh, in accounting, Ulrich, Accounting II, oh my heavens, so hard, but I did  like him, I did like him. Then Professor Jackman, and what was his first  name? I should remember, and he used to actually do a bike ride through the  Arbuckle Mountains here.  McDougal That   s cool.  Killblane Years later, we reconnected. He taught business law, and I loved that class.  That was really a great class to really get an idea, and I think, at that time,  there wasn   t as much closeness in the colleges, whereas they really tried to  envelop people and make the College of Business the College of  Ag riculture . I think ag always did it just because of the virtue of the nature  of what they were doing and all. People were always very close in the  College of Ag, but there was so many people in business that we just went to  class. If you didn   t have something else you were involved in, you might get  involved in the business clubs and things of that nature, and I noticed with  the boys that they emphasize that so much more. Unfortunately, I don   t  think they   ve done it as much as they should have, but it was fun, yeah. I  just remember Mr. Ulrich   s class. It was hard, yeah. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Were you involved in any other clubs on campus?  Killblane I   m trying to remember. No, no, I pretty much was just the sorority, yeah,  yeah, which I would change that if, and I think, again, today, they put a  much greater emphasis on being involved in other things, which is good. I  mean, you need to be a little more dimensional.  Nykolaiszyn Well, you   re approaching graduation with your degree in finance. What are  you hoping your next step will be? Do you have an idea, a plan?  Killblane Well, the immediate plan was that that August was 1984, and the campaign,  the election and all, was back in cycle. It was a presidential year. The  Republican convention was going to be in Dallas, and a very, very close  friend of our family that had been in Oklahoma Republican politics was  going to be chairmen of the convention setup and organizing and doing all  of the things of the convention. I knew my dad had talked to Rick and that I  could go down and intern and volunteer, basically, for that summer. I knew I  18  was going to Dallas in June or end of June, July, somewhere in there, to  work through the convention and be there and just do whatever they needed  me to do. When I went to interview that spring semester, it was rather  difficult to say,    Well, I would be available in late August, maybe  September.    I mean, they really want people to come to work June, May.     Let   s get to work.    I didn   t have a real stellar experience interviewing for  jobs. I tried. One job in particular I interviewed for, I had sat down, had the  interview, had my business suit on, and talked to the gentleman, and really,  it was Koch Industries in Kansas.  My best friend, her boyfriend was working at Koch, and I was actually  dating one of his friends. We thought this would just be really fun to get to  go up to Koch, and it would have been a great opportunity and a job. I  would have loved that. We went in to interview and talk, and Connie, my  friend, got the second interview. I get this letter back addressed to Mr. Casey  Killblane. I   m like,    I was in a dress, okay? How can you not know that I  was   ,    of which her boyfriend and the guy I was dating were very upset  and were just ranting,    How could you have done   .    Anyway, I didn   t get  that. My interview experience was not great, had talked with a bank  examiner, had looked at that and had an interview to look at that. Again,  because I had and I wanted to work at the Republican convention, I was  limiting myself to some degree, but it paid off. It was well worth it, and it  was a lot of fun to go down. I was just a gopher. I mean, I would go for this,  and I   d go for that. I   d keep track of everybody   s stuff. It was a great  opportunity, but it did slow down the job process, as far as finding a job.  Nykolaiszyn Well, I definitely want to get a little bit into your work in politics, but before  we do that, let   s talk about graduation. What was graduation like?  Killblane Oh, graduation was fun, just had this conversation with Trevor, our oldest,  who is doing this in May. It was   neither of my brothers walked. They were  just graduating, and I think that   s maybe more typical male. I don   t know,  but not with these two males. They will be walking. (Laughter) Graduation  comes up, and of course we had all been talking about it. I remember Mom  and Dad came up, and a guy that I was dating was there. We had a bottle of  champagne out on the lawn at this little picnic area after I had walked over,  and I remember just walking across this huge stage and sitting out in the  sun. It was really a neat, neat thing to be one of so many and to make that  accomplishment, to finally know that you had achieved your goal and you  were walking on down the path there. It was a fun day, a fun day, and it was  neat that Mom and Dad had come up for it also.  Nykolaiszyn Okay. You   ve been politically tied even before coming to OSU. Could you  talk a little bit about your involvement with politics and where it stemmed  from?  19  Killblane Yeah, oh, definitely my father and mother who were very, very active,  probably since birth, I probably was going to county conventions when I  was in the womb, more than likely, with Mom and Dad. When Dad moved  here in    49, there were four Republicans in Murray County. We have not  seen the days that we see now where   s there   s a much larger registration  number than previous years. They worked hard. They worked very, very  hard to try to get things changed and to get more people to register and to  say, because Oklahoma   s conservative. I mean, by and large, Oklahoma   s an  extremely conservative state. It   s just we didn   t register that way. That was  always the quest that Dad had in all of his   . We grew up going to the state  convention. We grew up going to county conventions, working in  campaigns, putting up yard signs. Even in our little bitty town of 1,100  people, we campaigned here just like everything, and presidential years were  always much more exciting. Dad and Mom actually went to the national  convention for Goldwater back in    68. I think that   s right,    68, I think. It has  been just a part of our life that we were doing, and as I said, I had  volunteered in 1980 as a page to the Republican convention. That was in  Detroit. That was wonderful. I mean, that was a great experience.  Again, what does a page do? They run and fetch, and at one point, I was in  the back hallways. There were secret service guys. Little did I know what  secret service guys did, but I would go get hot dogs for them. They   d be  standing there going,    I   m getting a hot dog. You want one?    They were my  hot dog buddies, and I got out of a lot of things because I was going to get  hot dogs for the secret service agents. It was fun to see that part of it and  begin to understand that there   s a lot of things that go on behind the scenes  so this thing out in front can always happen. I constantly think what   s  behind is much more important sometimes. That started it all, then  volunteered down in 1984, and that opened up a lot of doors. Probably one  of the biggest lessons was if you   re willing to do the schlep work, if you   re  willing to haul the bags, to get the hot dogs, to carry the paper here or there,  whatever, doors open, and opportunities can arise from it. I worked, at that  point, with the operations for the whole convention and went and fetched,  did all of these things for Andy, who was the officer for that, and then  through that, I met some people that were then helping with the vice  president   s advance team. The advance team goes in prior to the principal,  whomever it is, president, vice president, first lady, second lady, whatever,  and plan the trip with the local host.  You go in advance and met the vice president, several of them on there, and  of course, convention is over, the nomination is held. Now we   re starting the  campaign, and I didn   t have a job. I was certainly available, and they said,     Would you like to start doing advance?    I got connected with the couple of  the teams that were doing it and started traveling. Now they would pay us  thirty dollars a day, and they would give you your flights, wherever you  were going to. They would send teams together to all these different  20  locations. The end of that campaign that year, I started and was in New  Orleans, was in Iowa, was in Des Moines, just hopscotching around and  going to different places and made some wonderful, wonderful friends,  learned a ton about just being resourceful. I mean, they say,    We   re going to  have an event here, and we   ve got to have piping drape. We   ve got to have  this, and this is the only amount of money we have.    Well, you have to go  figure out how you   re going to make these things happen, how are you  going to get to the local press and make sure they understand so there   s local  coverage as well as all the press that   s coming off of the airplanes with the  principal whom, at that point, it was Vice President Bush. It was a great  experience and, I think, probably gave me a wonderful foundation for  understanding how the pieces of things work together, that there   s always a  team, and people have to work together to make something successful, that  very seldom is it just one person ever that can make it happen.  We won that election, and then they still had some advance that was going  on. I didn   t really have a job. That was November. I worked up through  November. Who gets a job at Christmas, okay? I mean, nobody does that.  There was another advance trip down to Austin, Texas, and they called, said,     Would you be available?       Absolutely, I can do that.    I head off to Austin,  and we were staying at a hotel. It was the Hyatt Regency, and at that point, I  had gotten acquainted with people in the hotel, the workers, the convention  staff people, the people who set chair, I mean, all of this stuff that you have  to put together, and ended up meeting the general manager as well. He  almost missed his photo-op with the vice president because he wasn   t where  he needed to be when I told him the schedule was, but we made it happen.  Well, turned out that about a month later they were looking for someone to  head up their convention services department. I had no background in it, but  they called to see if I   d come interview. I interviewed, and I got that job. It  was all because of being down there previously and working and doing  things and just being resourceful.  That started it, but there was always still a pull towards that and wanted to  stay connected and did. It was probably about eight, nine months later my  dad and uncle decided that they would bring one child from each family  back to the ranch to learn what the ranching was, the ranching and the oil  company, and how things operated and whatnot. I was the third choice, the  third child. I mean, the oldest brother was already established. The middle  brother was not coming back to Davis from Oklahoma City, and he called.  He said,    Would you want to do it?    I go,    Absolutely.    I had stacked  enough chairs at the hotel that I knew I didn   t want to manage people, that  this was not my forte. It was great, and I learned a lot, probably, again, one  of those things that you take forward with you. You look back, going,    Oh, I  learned that there,    but I didn   t want to do it the rest of my life. I came home  under the understanding that I could do advance still. I could stay involved  with the Bushes and travel and get to go to lots of places, which I got to go  21  to Brazil for the president of Brazil   s inauguration and got to do just some  really great trips on that side of it, but I got to come home and begin to learn  and create a completely different relationship with my father. I was always  his baby girl, still was, still am. I mean, I always will be his baby girl, but all  of a sudden, we were going into computers. We were trying to change some  things.  I became    Oh, yeah, you can actually have a brain too, huh, yeah, and  actually work,    which was a big step for that generation. Mom didn   t work.  He took care of her, and that was his role. That was a big thing for Dad and  Uncle Burke to be able to embrace and let me come back and step into that  role, which was great. That lasted two years, and I got a call. Actually, I  guess, after that campaign in    84, I worked at the inaugural. I went up that  year, and that was Reagan and Bush   s second inaugural. Oh, it was so cold. I  mean, they had to bring the inauguration inside, but I worked there again. I  got a little bit of money and had a roommate, lived there, though, for about  two, three months, interviewed for a job with Mrs. Bush that year and did  not get it as her personal aide. It got down to three of us, and we went to the  vice president   s house and had an interview, sat on a beautiful couch and see  Fred the dog was right here by her. We chatted, and oh, she was just lovely,  loved her. I really thought I nailed the interview. Apparently, I didn   t. She  said,    I   m sixty-two, and I   m not going to carry my bags anymore,    and she  flew commercially always. She said,    You would have to carry my bags.    I  said,    Oh, Mrs. Bush, that   s not a problem at all. You see, I grew up on a  ranch, and I hauled hay. I can carry your bag.     I mean, I thought that was a good answer. (Laughter) Anyway, we   ve  laughed about it since, and I didn   t get the job. Another lady who was  wonderful, just quite nice and very sweet, got the job, and she was with  them just at two years. After that, I go to Austin, then come here, and I was  here two years. Her chief of staff called June 12 at four o   clock in the  afternoon, but who remembers specifics? (Laughter) She said,    Casey, Mrs.  Elizabeth is leaving, and would you be interested in talking with Mrs. Bush  again about the job?    and I said,    Well, I would be interested, but I   m not  going through the big process. If there   s a hundred people going, I   m not  doing it.    We agreed there wasn   t. I flew out and interviewed, and it was  hard to decide. I mean, I knew I was leaving here, which really was a career,  a life of something. I mean, it wasn   t the most opportune place to be single. I  mean, there   s not a plethora of single men running around Murray County,  not at that time, anyway, but it was the family. It was a heritage. I mean, it  was the family life, and it was a great life. I love it, but I went to DC and  interviewed.  As we were chatting, Mrs. Bush, she and I were talking once again, and  she   s in the middle of the interview, stopped and just said,    I want you to  take the job, but I can   t go through another one of these searches until after  22  the campaign. You have to promise that you won   t leave until       he was  going to be running for president. Then I said,    I can do that,    and of course,  her chief of staff was sitting over in the corner going,    Oh, but we haven   t  talked.    (Laughter) Mrs. Bush said,    Figure it out    and    When can you  start?    I said,    I can be here whenever you need me to be.    I guess I really  knew and I think Dad knew that if it worked out that I was going to take it,  but it was hard. It was hard to decide because I knew if they didn   t win, I  was done, and that was about a year. I was going in in August. The election  would be that next August or next November, a year-and-a-half, but if they  did win, I would stay longer for somewhat. You knew there was an end to it.  It wasn   t something I was going to continue to do forever. I gave that up, of  which my oldest brother was then ready to come here. It worked out well. I  mean, all things do work out quite well for everybody. I went and spent two  years with Mrs. Bush and carried her bags, literally, through many, many  places. They did win the election, which was quite fun, and I stayed nine  months into the White House before I got married. We went to California.  Nykolaiszyn Wow. Any highlights (I   m sure there were plenty) during your time with  Mrs. Bush?  Killblane Probably the time in Kennebunkport  Maine , when we would go to  Kennebunkport, which is where they have the summer home, it would just  be Mrs. Bush and myself and the secret service. She always had three secret  service as vice president   s wife. There were a few more once she became  First Lady, and we had to fly on an Air Force plane once she was First Lady.  She fought it, but when they told her they would pull off every bag and re-sweep  it again every time she got on a plane, she agreed not to  inconvenience anyone. No more could I carry her bag and walk in and sit in  first class. I mean, they weren   t going to let her do that. She acquiesced, but  as Vice President and even still in Kennebunkport as First Lady, there were  very few people there. It would be myself, her, one or two of the stewards,  Paola, the woman who had been with them forever to help with the house,  and then grandkids. At this point in time, Barbara and Jenna Bush, the twins,  they were five-year-olds. We watched Alice in Wonderland I can   t tell you  how many times. George P., who is down in Texas now as one of the  commissioners in Texas, state commissioners, he was thirteen and a  thirteen-year-old. Let   s just put it that way, but I loved him.  Noelle   s sister, she and I became very, very close, and just all of the  grandkids because they would come and spend time there. The whole family  would. I was constantly around, and that was a highlight to see them in an  element that was just very real and wonderful. The stewards tried to teach  me how to cook. I think they gave up on it. (Laughter) They became very  worried once I got engaged and I was going to be married. They really put  into high gear and did try to teach me all of these things, and some things, I  retained, many of them, I did not. The first day I went to work, though, she  23  was in Kennebunkport. I got moved up, found an apartment, was in DC a  week or two, and then I was to fly up to Kennebunkport and meet her there.  I hadn   t seen her since I interviewed back in June, and I arrived in  Kennebunkport. At the time, his personal aide was a very, very dear friend  of mine, and we actually were dating from afar, I   m sure the motivation of  Mrs. Bush thinking if we were in the same town, something great would  happen. It did not. I mean, we dated, but in the end, it did not work.  Anyway, Tim was telling me to go on up to the house. I   m walking up this  paved road on this peninsula, and I   m walking out.  Mrs. Bush is out in her garden, and the president from Zaire is supposed to  be coming for dinner. My goal is to get there, say hello, and get outside. I  mean, I knew    Do not be seen.    I carry the purse. I carry the bag. I have the  schedule, and I know her pantyhose color, okay? Those are my big things in  life. I   m walking up, and she   s in the garden. Fred   s gone, and Millie is now  the new dog. We   re all out there, and I   m walking up. Millie is running  towards her, and about this time, the motorcade passes me. They pull up to  the front door, and this is President Mobutu from Zaire. He gets out with this  leopard skin hat on. I mean, it   s quite enormous. Here comes Millie running  towards Mrs. Bush. I   m walking towards Mrs. Bush. Millie has a dead bird  in her mouth, and here   s the president from Zaire. Mrs. Bush says,    Casey,  I   m so glad you   re here.    She reaches in her pocket, she hands me a  Kleenex, and she goes,    Could you get rid of the dead bird?    (Laughter) I   m  like,    Sure.    I pick up the dead bird, and I   m going,    Okay, where do I go?     I   ve never been to this place before, never, and I   m in there. I   m looking at  the house. It   s gorgeous.  The ocean   s in the background, and I   m looking at the house. There   s a door  over here, which, obviously, is the front door, and that   s where President  Mobutu is. I   m not going there. Here   s another door over here, but I see  nothing. I mean, I   ve got to get rid of this dead bird. Why didn   t I go throw  it in the ocean? I don   t know. I walk in, and I choose the door on the left. I  walk in right into the kitchen where they are cooking dinner for President  Mobutu. I go,    Hi, I   m Casey, the new personal aide. I need to throw away  this bird,    and of course they   re like,    Oh my God.    They shoo me outside,  and they   re,    Here   s the trashcan,    very neatly hidden. My first job,  assignment and duty was to get rid of the dead bird, which really should   ve  told me that life would be full of adventure and, fortunately, nothing that I  wasn   t willing to do. We babysat. We helped clean the house when we  opened it up in March, everything from just helping her learn how to use a  computer, which was a lot of fun, yeah, lots of great memories, places  traveled, wonderful, seventeen different foreign countries, got to see Poland  under communist rule and then got to go back under freedom, democracy,  which was a lot of fun to see the two in contrast to that. It was neat.  Nykolaiszyn How did you meet your husband?  24  Killblane We were college sweethearts, yes, yes.  Nykolaiszyn At OSU?  Killblane We are OSU, yes, yes, yes.  Nykolaiszyn Oh, well, it all comes back around. (Laughter)  Killblane It does. It does many times over. He was from Ponca City  Oklahoma , and  he actually went to OSU. He was three years older. He was there before I  was, and my oldest brother and he were buddies. That   s, of course, how we  met. I would go over and make cookies or cook at my brother   s house, and  they would all converge. I mean, they   d be around and whatnot. We dated  two different times in college. My freshman year, we dated for about six,  eight months and ended up going into the summer, and of course, that was  distance, two hours away in the summer. He was going to room with my  brother that summer, and that really doesn   t work well, to room with your  girlfriend   s brother because they were friends before. They wanted to go out  and go to the bar, whatever, find dates and do all of these things. Well, this  is supposed to be my boyfriend. Anyway, poor Hugh was right in the middle  of it all. We agreed not to date, which irritated me, but that was okay until I  was coming back in the fall for my sophomore year and came back. He just  really wasn   t calling me quick enough. We didn   t date. Anyway, that  happened. Then again, my junior year, we dated again, broke up, always on  the best of terms, though. It was not a good time, my immaturity of him not  spending enough time with me, I mean,    I need to be the center of your  universe,    and he actually had a painting business and owned a liquor store.  He had bought a liquor store at that point. It was a great place to cash a  check. There were just things that evolved, but we stayed in touch always.  He   d actually gone to California with his brother and had started building.  He was in investment banking in the    80s when the world crashed. He ended  up out in California and started building with a gentleman out there, and I  was on a campaign trip. Just God   s grace, I   m sure, is how our paths crossed  again because a card that I   d sent to him came back, and Mom said,    Oh,  this card came back that you sent to Hugh. He   s in California.    I called his  brother, and he didn   t come up the first time when we were going to be in  LA. He was in San Diego. He said,    Call next time you   re around.    I said,     Okay.    Labor Day comes around the next year or whatever, and we   re back  out there. I called, and his brother said,    If he tells you he   s not coming up,  you call me back because he moped around here for three months.    I went,     What, really? Oh, wow.    This is seven years later. Anyway, we started  dating from afar, and again, no cellphones. It was only when we could get  on telephones and talk, and I took a red eye out to California to see him and  started dating officially at that point. Of course, I supposedly was dating the  25  other guy, but it wasn   t going anywhere. We were chatting, and he finally  said,    I   m not doing this again if we don   t think we   re going to talk long-term.     Of course, I didn   t know really what he was saying. I mean, I was  being na  ve,    yeah, yeah, absolutely.    Anyway, we started our big  conversations and our big deal, and we got engaged. It was in    89. We got  married in November of    89, and I moved to California. I gave up my  political life, at that point, to go west.  Nykolaiszyn Wow.  Killblane It was fun, though. It was really neat, had to fess up to Mrs. Bush that Tim  and I were not going to work out. It was after the election. I thought,    Well,  if we lose, I don   t have to confess to anything. I   m going home.    If we lose,  I don   t have a desire to stay. I mean, I   m doing the job I wanted to do. I  didn   t want to be in DC; I wanted to be with Mrs. Bush. That was what my  desire was. We won. I had to confess. I went into her a day or so after the  election, and I said,    I need to talk to you.    She said,    Okay.    I said,    Tim  and I broke up.    She goes,    Oh, I was just telling George the other night,     It   s just not there between those two. It   s just not there.    He said,    Oh, Bar,  it is, too. They   re just perfect for each other. She goes,    men.       (Laughter) I  went,    Yeah, really.    (Laughter) Anyway, I was a little timid, but that  summer, Hugh would send care packages to Kennebunkport. He would have  things in there for Noelle, the granddaughter, scrunchies because we were  playing a lot of tennis together and doing things, and he was just always  quite kind. He won Mrs. Bush   s heart over before he ever met her because  he was so kind to Noelle and would send sweet things. By the time she met  him, she loved him, and they had a going away party for me. She kept trying  to talk to him. We were in the White House, and she   d walk up.    Now I  need to talk to you,    and she would get teary-eyed. He   d go,    Mrs. Bush, it   s  okay.    She goes,    No, you don   t understand.    It was neat, and she was very  excited. It was fun that I got to experience all that with her and go through  that.  Nykolaiszyn How long were you in California?  Killblane We were there from    89 until    96, seven years, eight years, however long  that is, yeah, yeah, in San Diego. He continued to build, and I worked for a  hospital foundation in fundraising and then went to a community  foundation, also in their fundraising, and was there, had both boys in  California. It was nice. Having worked at the hospital, I knew all the  doctors. That was really quite nice and easy, but we really wanted to raise  the boys in Oklahoma. Trevor was two, and Paxton was seven months old.  We said, that summer of    96,    Hell or high water, we   ll be back before the  end of    96 somehow,    and there was a house here on the ranch. We asked  Mom and Dad if we could at least land here and figure out what we were  going to do because we really had no clue, but we just wanted to get back to  26  Oklahoma. We landed here. Hugh went back to California a couple times to  finish a house that he was building in Malibu. I would   ve bet money that we  would   ve eventually moved somewhere, Ardmore, Oklahoma City, Ponca,  somewhere bigger because Hugh grew up in Ponca City, but he fell in love  with it as much, if not more, than I did. I would   ve always been the one  willing to have gone. He would   ve had to have driven. He drove to  Oklahoma City for about six years building, but he   s like,    Nope. This is  where we need to be. This is where the boys need to grow up.    It   s been  amazing.  Nykolaiszyn I bet your parents were pleased to have you back.  Killblane Yes, yes. It was quite fun. We had a blast with them. My father passed away  in 2012, but he got really close with the boys. That   s what I remember when  we were moving back. They had been out to San Diego for, again,  Republican convention in    96, and we   d seen everybody. A friend of ours  that was in the delegation who was a doctor pulled my oldest brother aside.  He goes,    Your dad doesn   t look good. He is a walking time bomb,    and he  smoked five packs of cigarettes a day. I had sent a card to him sometime  after. I didn   t do that often, but I sent him a card. I said,    Dad, we   re excited  to be moving back, and I want you to know that we   re coming back.    We  had two boys. My oldest brother had three girls. My middle brother had two  boys, but they were in Oklahoma City.    These are your boys. I   m excited  that you   re going to teach them things on the ranch, but it   s going to be  really hard for them to ride with you on the tractor if you have an oxygen  bottle. It won   t work, and I   m not asking you to be a babysitter.    I mean, I  knew very well that they were not going to be babysitting grandparents.  They would pay for the babysitter so we could go and do things with them. I  mean, we did lots of that, which was wonderful, and that was just all that I  said in the letter. Literally three weeks before we moved back, he quit  smoking     Nykolaiszyn Wow.  Killblane    yeah, and I mean, just cold turkey. He bored out little cigarettes, the size  of a cigarette, a dowel rod, bore it out and put cinnamon in it, and he had a  whole pocket, a whole carton of these like they were cigarettes. He played  with them and that Nicorette gum, which he chewed until the day he died,  literally, and that was a long time. (Laughter) Ninety-six to 2012, he was  still chewing the Nicorette gum, but anyway, it did and I   m sure is one of  the reasons that he got to live that much longer, that and when he got his  helicopter. He started flying helicopters again. It was great, and the boys  really did, they had fun with him and with Mom. Trevor was really, really  close with Dad, and Paxton and Mom, who we call Granny Sue, they   re  thicker than thieves. If any of them ever get in trouble, they will be calling  Granny Sue before they would call us, especially Paxton, and she would go  27  running immediately because they really, really are close. They   re very good  to her. I mean, they call her. They   re walking across campus today and will  call her and say,    Hey, what are you doing, Granny Sue? Just going to class,  wind   s blowing.    They don   t talk long. We   re very blessed. They   re very  sweet to her, and she enjoys it enormously.  Nykolaiszyn Well, you moved back to Oklahoma, Murray County, where it all began, and  what are you doing now with your career?  Killblane Hugh still has a building company and rental property. I do the books for  those. I have a small little oil and gas company that I run, mainly royalty  investments that were inherited from Uncle Lou Wentz and my own dad and  uncle who were kind enough to help us out, the children, and then I help  Mom and had been helping Dad on the ranch and the oil company that they  have with their books and management and all of that. I have a lot of hats  that I wear, but the big thing is just really taking care of Mom, making sure  things continue to go, hopefully, well, see what our future holds, how we  can keep the ranch together and make it profitable so that it   s a legacy for  our children, for her grandchildren, and, hopefully, generations to come.  Nykolaiszyn Is it primarily cattle?  Killblane All cattle and hay, we do bale some hay and sell it, but it   s primarily still  Herefords. I think probably Dad would come back and haunt us if we ever  did anything other than Herefords. (Laughter) I think everyone   s fairly  brainwashed into that. I think we   re safe for a few generations, anyway. It   s  a great life because you get to be outdoors. Both boys love to hunt. Hugh  loves to hunt. They hunt deer. Hugh   s more of a duck hunter, bird hunter,  than a deer hunter, but both boys love to be outdoors and to fish and hunt  and play.  Nykolaiszyn Are you still involved with TSET?  Killblane Yes, yes, still on the board for TSET. TSET   s the  Oklahoma  Tobacco  Settlement Endowment Trust. I was appointed to that in 2002 finishing a  term from one of the original board members when the state voted to  establish a trust fund for it, and that   s the tobacco money that comes from  the tobacco companies to help offset health issues caused by tobacco use.  TSET now is approaching a billion dollars in endowment, and again, the  fund sits there. Only the earnings can be spent on programs to improve the  health for Oklahomans. Last year, we had about  53 million to grant. This  year, we have about  42 million. It has affected everyone. We   re very  happy, though, that we   re able to continue all that we   ve started and have  expanded into research, but all of our research has to do with those illnesses  that are primarily caused by tobacco use and also the leading causes of death  in Oklahoma. Cardiovascular disease and cancer truly are our biggest killers,  28  and so much of that is caused through tobacco and ill health, obesity, lack of  nutrition, fitness. We   re really excited. We   ve had a grant or two with OSU  and really excited about the whole wellness side that   s happening there. It   s  a lot of fun to see. We obviously have seen a reduction in smoking  prevalence in the state. When I got on the board and when we started, it was  about 28 percent, and we   re down to 21  percent .  We   re still above the national average, which is not acceptable, but we   re  seeing the dominoes click off. We   re seeing it, and of course, there   s always  the big debate on what are the real drivers, how do you get people to quit. I  think it   s a cultural change, and that comes about very slowly, unfortunately.  There are policies that help expedite that. There are also price points that  help determine that as well and, of course, all of the arguments, pro and con,  against that, but there is data to show that as the price of cigarettes go up,  youth smoking, especially, goes down. If we can get youth to stop, I mean,  we want everybody to stop, but we just don   t want people to begin the  habits. Of course, the nuances of electronic cigarettes, what is that, really?  There   s not the data out there. There   s not the research to say whether it  does really help you stop. You talk to one person. It helps. You talk to  another one.    All I did was inhale more nicotine.    They do know that  nicotine is not good for young children, period, in any form, and it   s actually  lethal. We keep making strides, but it   s exciting to see that we   re able to  expand. The focus is still tobacco, get people to quit, but we see that there   s  a whole spectrum. A lot of things need to change in a person   s life to help  them be successful in their quit attempts. It   s been fun. It   s been a challenge.  It   s going to get even more challenging because supposedly we have a pot of  money sitting there, which we don   t. I mean, the billion is in an endowment  fund.  We only have the earnings. When everybody   s investments go down, ours  do, too, but really exciting. We were able to help with the residency program  at OSU-Tulsa. That was really a lot of hard work. We see the involvement  with TSET is really breaking down some of these barriers that have existed  in our state, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, OSU, OU. No one wants to beat OU  more than I do, I mean, and I love it when we do. (Laughter) I love it and  have a hard time on other issues, but we really have seen when we   ve been  able to help promote when it   s better for the state. A gentleman on our board  who works for OU Health Science Center actually helped OSU-Tulsa  develop this whole plan from the expertise he had at OU   s Health Science  Center to ask these questions and point out things about residency. We came  up with a plan that hopefully will be able to go forward and really help our  state. That was exciting, and I think more so than the actual residency slots  was the conversation that   s happened. Now OSU has come and talked to the  Stevenson Cancer Center, which, I actually was a patient. I have to like OU  for something. (Laughs) They   re beginning that whole conversation about     You don   t have to have a cancer center in every single place. We have  29  resources. Use what we have. How can things that are here benefit there?     and vice versa.  It really is exciting to see some of those walls begin to be broken down, and  I think that goes to the leadership of both of the colleges. I think President  Boren and President Hargis really are striving for that, and that   s really  beginning to filter down, to have some really good impact. One of the grants  that we did first on was to the adult stem cell research center, and it ended  up being a conglomeration of OMRF, the Oklahoma Medical Research  Foundation, OSU, and OU. It got bogged down in the talks and all as to who  would have the money, how this would work. We were talking a million  dollars a year, and the second tier people couldn   t get there. Finally, we  bring in the heads of those departments, and the only people who weren   t in  the room was President Hargis and President Boren but those right below  them. We all sat and talked, and they said,    No. This is a done deal. This is  not a problem. OMRF will have the money.    We   re sitting here amazed that  both colleges would agree with that. I mean, having been in fundraising, you  do not give up a million dollars in your bank account. You don   t do that. It  was the first nick in that armor, and it just continues to develop and  probably, I think, one of our best accomplishments. I hope that we continue  to be able to be that facilitator, to really bring things together and collaborate  and move the state forward.  Nykolaiszyn Well, we find ourselves in another election cycle.  Killblane Yes. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Are you involved politically?  Killblane I   m not really, not so much this time. It   s been interesting, of course, biased,  and that   s what everybody tells me,    You can   t even see past your nose.  You couldn   t vote for anybody but a Bush.    Probably that is true to some  point. It   s frustrating. I know what the process is. I know that to govern and  to lead, you get more flies with honey than you do vinegar. The process in  Washington DC is not as simple as standing up and saying,    I don   t want  that to happen.    A president does not legislate. He does not get to sign law. I  mean, he signs them, but he doesn   t get to make the laws. That   s the  Congress and the Senate. It   s just so difficult. It   s not an easy process. You  just see greater success and greater things happen when people are able to  work together, and the minute gauntlets are thrown and    my way or the  highway    is the ultimatum, I don   t think it   s good for our country. I really  don   t. Obviously, I have Republican background. Obviously, that   s where  my tendencies are, but I still hold the office of president with a high regard  and high respect. I want us to have that individual there that actually earns  that, that I can be proud when they   re overseas representing America, that  we   re strong, that we are kind but we are strong and kind through strength,  30  not through pandering or bullying or anything else. Yeah, my favorite would  be Jeb. It   s not looking real good. Of course, they pulled out the big guns in  New Hampshire.  Nykolaiszyn They did. They sure did.  Killblane Mrs. Bush is there. I never saw anything, and I will say back in    88 when we  were going through this, his father was a very distant third coming out of  Iowa. Who knows? I mean, you never know in this day and time, but of  course, we didn   t have social media and all that we have today that makes it  instantaneous. I don   t know if that   s good or bad, but America prevails. I  mean, they will.  Nykolaiszyn Are you going to make a stop at the convention?  Killblane We   re pondering that. We   re going to have to make up decisions pretty  quick because those county conventions and then the state convention will  come up. My dad had been to every convention until 2008. He had been to  all of them before that. That was the first year that we didn   t go. We talk  about it, but two boys in school and whatnot, it changes some perspective.  It   ll be an interesting one for sure, yeah.  Nykolaiszyn Well, looking back through your time at OSU and your career, how did  attending the university impact your life?  Killblane Probably began to develop some independence, and yet, the importance of  being part of a team, that whole concept of    not just me alone,    that there   s  more involved and you get so much more done when you work together and  being part of something bigger than yourself, I think that that parlayed into  being able to work in the hotel, being able to carry bags in a campaign and  schlep things around and all of those things and then even to here now, to  work and think about the family as a whole and not just my little wedge of  the pie. I mean, what do we need to do to think about generations to come?  What are things that we need to look at so that the boys hopefully have an  opportunity to always call this home and for their children as well? I mean,  back in that day, we did not win football games, okay? You had to be this  loyal, loyal fan, okay? I mean, there were a lot of games that we sat through,  and every time,    we   ll get them next week    or    next season is going to be  unbelievable.    I mean, we were the eternal optimists. I think a huge family  experience, being optimistic was always one of them and just to be proud  and know that there   s a lot of good out there and to be able to grab onto that  has transcended a lot of different areas.  Nykolaiszyn How do you show your OSU pride these days?  31  Killblane Oh, got an OSU decal on the front of my car, I love the color orange, often  wear orange. Everybody goes,    What   s your favorite color?    and I go,     Orange, why would you ask?    Friends give orange. We have our OSU  room with a pool table and that bar lamp over it that   s OSU. We still go to  all of our games. Everybody knows on Saturday that we will be in Stillwater  when there   s a game there. If it wasn   t so far away, we   d probably be there  for basketball, but knowing the two hours and late night, those are long  drives. We have gotten a little bit involved. They   ve started an alumni club  here in Murray County. We had a gentleman move back, Bill Jamison, from  Boston. He   s real eager. We went to high school together. He started watch  parties and things of that. We try to promote. We talk to a lot of kids as  they   re getting ready to go to college. We hope to encourage and try to talk  them into coming to OSU but primarily wear that orange and put those  stickers on our car.  Nykolaiszyn Are there more alums in these parts now?  Killblane Yes, yes, actually, I mean, it   s fun, and even since we moved back in    96  until now. That has to do with the success of the football, basketball, all the  programs. I mean, everybody starts jumping on, but we actually have had  quite a few more kids going to college. I believe Trevor   s year, there were  about three or four, Paxton   s year, about the same number. We had a young  man that walked on at OSU for a semester, but there weren   t any  scholarships. He really needed help with scholarships. He came back. I  mean, we   ve had a few more that are beginning to think OSU is always an  option, and I know that they   re doing a nice job trying to get down and  recruit and to be there. Yeah, it   s contagious, yeah, a lot more in Ardmore,  and that filters up this way, too. It   s nice.  Nykolaiszyn You   ve spent most of your life in Murray County and Davis, Oklahoma. How  has it changed through the years?  Killblane There   s a lot of pride, and sometimes that   s good and that   s bad. There   s a  lot of we want it to stay just the same. Fortunately, we   ve had some people  that have moved to town that do want to see some things change and keep  our downtown alive because a lot of small towns, their downtown has died  and moved off. I think we are trying to embrace tourism a little more with  Turner Falls and the lake. I think some of that is happening where we   re  embracing that, and of course, as with the oil and gas industry goes, so does  our area because there   s a lot of work tied to that. We see those ups and  downs. A lot has stayed the same. I mean, it   s still the small town. The  school is still excellent, has always been just wonderful. We like to brag that  we have some of the high-scorers, and people want to come here. We   d like  to say it   s academics. I think it   s actually the football program, but that   s  okay. You have to move here to play here. We get people moving in often.  They have a great coaching staff that actually is worried about the boys and  32  the tradition that is a tradition of winning, and it   s good. I mean, it   s good to  learn how to be a winner and how to not want to not win, not strive to do  your best so that you have the good results, changes, a few, but not a whole  lot. The school is a little bit bigger than when I was here but not a lot bigger.  There   s a couple of new buildings, which is nice. We hope there   s a few  more coming in the future, but still a two-lane road right down through Main  Street, one stoplight. That stays the same, but I think people are beginning to  really look outside and say,    We do have to embrace tourism and other  people and progress.     Nykolaiszyn We talk to a lot of OSU alums, and we find that folks tend to be pretty loyal  to the university. What do you think helps foster some of that loyalty?  Killblane One, I think when you go to OSU, you   re out in the middle of nowhere.  There   s not a lot of people that commute, certainly not in our day. I mean,  there may be more now. Certainly with the online stuff, it   s changed a little  bit, but when you go there, you become a part of the community. We   ve  often laughed about this. When you walk across campus,    How are you  doing? How are you doing? Howdy.    Everybody   s talking. When I have  walked across other campuses, people don   t do that. That   s not just here in  Oklahoma but in other parts of the country. I mean, they   re on a mission.  They   re walking. That   s it, but it   s a very open environment. Again, I think  part of that is the rural aspect. Of course, Stillwater has certainly changed  enormously, and thank God they have a Chick-fil-A now, okay (I mean,  there are certain things in life), and Starbucks. (Laughter) I   m very happy,  but it still is that feeling because Oklahoma City, Norman, Moore, they   ve  all jumbled together. You can very easily go to OU and not ever be on  campus or live on campus. You go park and walk wherever. There   s a lot of  extra commuting that goes on, whereas when you get to Stillwater, you   re  there.  If you choose to be on campus, you   re on campus. I think our Homecoming  is a huge reason. People identify. You get involved with something, and  whether you   re in the Greek system or not, you   re going to be sucked into  Homecoming, if nothing else by you can   t do anything on Walkaround night  other than be involved in it because you   re going to be in the crowd of the  sea of humanity that rains down upon Stillwater. I think that the university  has done a really nice job in trying to embrace that and expand that,  welcoming for the football games, not putting up so many restrictions on the  tailgating.    Okay, tailgate on the grass. Okay, we have to re-sod.    I mean, I  can   t imagine what they have to do to keep all that, and it   s still beautiful.  The university itself takes pride in the campus and how the campus looks.  That makes it easy for alumni to be proud of something. To see things in  good repair, you   re much more proud of. I mean, it   s so much easier to take  people to Boone Pickens Stadium than it was    Rustoleum,    okay? I mean, I  remember walking in and seeing, I mean, it was fun, but it   s    Wow.    Now  33  when you walk in and you really feel like it   s a   . Being able to see the  university, take pride in it, I think, filters down all the way through.  McDougal Well, I guess I have one question as a recent graduate. What advice would  you have for current students or people that are just leaving OSU, having  gone through just the whole college experience yourself?  Killblane Stay connected, stay connected. Definitely stay connected with the friends  that you have now and know that even some of those that weren   t your  closest, your paths can cross at any point in time, and that   s something that I  don   t think you value until it happens to you, that you will see that down the  road. Stay involved with the university. I mean, they   ve got a ton of ways to  do that now, very easy, and I think that you all, as opposed to our  generation, have such a greater uptake on that because the emphasis at  college now is to be involved. Don   t just be involved in your one little  group, but how can you be involved in other things in campus and explore  that? They encourage that, and it appears it   s a much easier and encouraged  aspect now. To put it into your realm, it   s a time in your life that you won   t  ever see again, and it   s not to say it   s the best time. It was pretty darn good.  I hope it   s not your best time because there   s still so much to look forward  to, but it   s one of those that you really do, it   s your first beginning of  independence without just being kicked out the door to cover everything on  your own. You   ve been allowed to gradually get into this and find out what  life is really going to be like, and just to value it, I think, is the biggest thing  because it   s hard, as someone graduating, to really understand more than  your sheet of paper the value that you   ve got with it because there   s so much  more to college than just the diploma. When you have the opportunity and  you   ve been given that opportunity to participate in campus life and to  participate in college, value that and really cherish it because there are a lot  that they don   t get that opportunity, that they are just getting that diploma so  that they can forward themselves and get better jobs. You have to have that.  When you   ve had that opportunity, really relish it and cherish it, and then  give back. How are you going to make a difference for those coming behind  you because you will be blessed way more than they are?  Nykolaiszyn We took a really quick fast-forward through your life. (Laughter) Is there  anything else you   d like to add before we close out today?  Killblane It was truly, as I say, probably some of the greatest years. Having just went  through a cancer bout, which is a boring subject, but anyway, it was all  good. Everything   s great. But you really do find   . That   s that time of life  that I was telling you about that all of a sudden you   re going,    Wow, that  really did matter.    Those days really do matter way beyond everything, to  really value and cherish that and then really to think about what can you  give back because the college has given you so much, not only in your  34  education but just in a variety of making you a well-rounded person. What  are the things you can do to give back? We   re at that point, and once we   re  finished with tuition, we   ll figure that one out. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Well, Casey, we definitely appreciate you taking time out to speak with us  this morning for this project. Thank you so much.  Killblane Thank you. It was fun.  -------  -------
