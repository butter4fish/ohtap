 Finchum Today is July 21, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Watonga,  Oklahoma  to speak with H.G. Tolbert. This is regarding  our Oklahoma 100 Year of Life project, so thank you for having us.  Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  H.G. Tolbert You don   t want to know why?  Finchum That too I guess. (Laughter)  H.G. Tolbert Well, when and where. When was January 22nd of the year of 19   oh  here I go, 1915. Out here in the west edge of Blaine County, on a farm.  A Negro woman was the midwife and she caught me as I left that  beautiful, wonderful home, and cleaned me up, and became my, I guess  you   d say, my godmother. The black people I have always   a lot of  them I   ve felt sorry for. I wish that the world, not Hod Tolbert, but the  world could be more meaningful for them than it has been in the United  States, but then as they came here as slaves, owned like somebody  owned property, that they could kill them if they wanted to. I have to  have a lot of sympathy for them, and my sympathy isn   t always  satisfied and never to my satisfaction, of course, But in their way they  have been good for America.  Finchum Well, did you have brothers or sisters?  H.G. Tolbert I had a sister that died before I was born. Well, my folks lived right here  at Watonga. We didn   t have a hospital and my dad took her to Clinton  and there she developed   well, she had appendicitis and it broke, and  then she died from   oh what do you call it? I forgot the name     H. Tolbert Peritonitis  5  H.G. Tolbert Yeah, peritonitis. Alright, then my folks had a son that was alive and he  became the only child then. Alright, then I came along to replace my  sister, and that   s why I   ve been such a sissy all my life. I came into the  world for the purpose of replacing a sister. Then my brother got killed  by   a horse threw him and killed him. Then that left me as an only  child when I was seven years old. I had to grow up as an only child. I  remember some of my friends going, in school,    Oh, you   ve got it so  wonderful  You don   t have any brothers or sisters to fight with.    I said,     You don   t know what it is to be lonely.    Brothers and sisters, they  have a good time fighting.  Finchum Sometimes.  H.G. Tolbert You got a brother, haven   t you?  Finchum No.  H.G. Tolbert You don   t?  Finchum No.  H.G. Tolbert You don   t understand me, do you?  Finchum I had two sisters, they fought. I stayed out of it.  H.G. Tolbert Yeah that   s   now you   ve had your share of fighting.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  H.G. Tolbert They were farmers at the time my brother was killed. We moved to  town and my dad went into the produce business, buying cream, eggs,  and farmers    produce. That was the name of the business, Farmers     Produce. That was his.  Finchum Had they moved to Oklahoma or were they born here?  H.G. Tolbert Let   s see, Mother was a Missourian. I think they called them Missouri  Pukes. Isn   t that what they called them? Missouri Pukes? Anyway, my  dad came from Indiana.  Finchum Where did you go to school? Like your elementary school days.  H.G. Tolbert Watonga, here   well, I started out in the country. They couldn   t stand  me, and they got rid of me by sending me to town to be with my folks.  6  Finchum Why couldn   t they stand you?  H.G. Tolbert (Laughs) If you were around here very long, you would understand.  You stick around, you   ll find out. (Laughter)  Finchum Are you pulling my leg?  H.G. Tolbert No, no, no, you seem to be doing alright.  Finchum So what year did you graduate from Watonga?  H.G. Tolbert I was the only one that was kicked out of school over here at Christmas  time. I was a sole graduate all by myself. I got along with people  alright, but sometimes I had   I was in a hurry. My son there will tell  you I   m pretty bad about getting in a hurry.  Finchum So 1932?  H.G. Tolbert Let   s see,    33. Let me see, then I went down to OU for a while. Had a  bunch of good guys down there, and I enjoyed some of my professors,  especially my English professor. I mean really and truly. He was the  next one. At that time he was writing a story about one of our western  heroes. He and I got along great, I liked the guy. I   ve written a few  books, but none of them are any good, but I give him the credit for that.  Telling me to   because that lets me open up my heart to the world, the  way I feel about a lot of things. Am I right about my books, Hal? He   s  read them all. He knows not to read them, see? I have a daughter, I have  two daughters in addition to my son, Hal, there. Hal, what   d I do with  your picture that I had of you there? What   d I do with it?  H. Tolbert You showed it to them.  H.G. Tolbert I just wanted to be sure that you   he   s my pride and joy. I have a  daughter that lives right over here on the southwest corner of this block.  She   s also one of my pride and joys. She   s an attorney here, and then I  have another daughter that   she   s my ornery kid. I mean, isn   t that  right? (Laughs) She has her life and I   m thoroughly enjoying it. She   s  bought a house out in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and she   s remodeling it to  suit them, not her, because they control how a house is arranged out  there because of the Mexican and the   well, how they want them to  look. She has made some investments that have made her   I guess I  would say    filthy rich   . But I   ll tell you what, she   s a lot of fun. Isn   t  that right? (Laughs) She   s quite a gal.  Finchum So you graduated from the University of Oklahoma?  7  H.G. Tolbert No.  Finchum No? Take me through your education.  H.G. Tolbert My first year of school was out in the country. My folks moved   well,  my brother got killed, we came to town, and they transferred me in here  and I went to school here in Watonga. They kicked me out at Christmas  about 1934,    35, anyway, and then I went down to OU for a while. Then  I wound up going to law school over in Tennessee. I was elected county  attorney here and I had a guy that was one of the fellow lawyers that I  thought was a crook. He got me to join the FBI  Federal Bureau of  Investigation  and he was appointed county attorney and I wasn   t a bit  happy over that because he was a thorough crook.  Bishop You worked for the FBI, was that before World War II or during World  War II?  H.G. Tolbert That was   well, we had started our war, but I guess it was during the  war, but I didn   t stay with the FBI. J. Edgar Hoover and I didn   t always  see eye to eye. I have been such an ignorant man in my life that I never  had sense enough to follow the men who actually were in charge. I   d  always break out on my own, to hell with them. That   s the way I felt  about   now J. Edgar Hoover as an individual was an awful good man,  but he had some employees that I wasn   t happy with. Then, of course I  had to work for them. I told them to go to hell.  Finchum And you were in the Army?  H.G. Tolbert O h yeah.  Finchum You couldn   t tell them to go to     H.G. Tolbert In effect, I did. I never went to boot camp, I never had to. What they  did, they found out that I   d been in the FBI and they put me to work. I  worked for the provost marshal there in Fort Sill. I had my own office,  had my own secretary. I   ll never forget one girl that was   you know the  Army had certain ways that had to be done. Whenever you took a  statement from somebody that maybe would help put them in the  penitentiary, why you ended up    further deponent sayeth not.    That   s  the end of the statement. I really thought a lot of that one secretary. She  was married and everything, and her husband was in the Army. They  worked there at the provost marshal.  We had a situation that came up over at Durant, from Lawton. You  know where Durant is, concerning the guy that was   well, anyway, we  ran into homosexuality. I   ll never forget this guy that we were  8  questioning. He was a pretty good fellow, actually he wasn   t a bad man  at all. He looked over at her and he said,    I think maybe you and I ought  to just go get a bottle of Chardonnay and        You know, with her. I   ll  never forget how she ended up her part of the statement,    further  deponent would let me heareth not.    (Laughter) Well, there   s a lot more.  We won   t go into all that.  Then I went over to Durant to try to help the school district out there  because he was there. He was a superintendent, this homosexual. I  didn   t like the idea of a homosexual being in charge of our school  system, whether it be Durant or anywhere. See, I was supposed to stay  out of that kind of work. I was an Army man and I should not, but I  thought,    Well that   s too important to me. To hell with them, I   m going  to do as I please here.    The way it was worded, that    further deponent  let me heareth not,    that did it. I went over to talk to the sheriff over  in   and he was the dumbest damn man. He didn   t know how     probably a pretty good sheriff, he might   ve been able to   I don   t know.  He didn   t know how to respect people always. He and I didn   t get along  too good, because he blurted out what was wrong and that   s when he  and I parted company. I mean to her and to her husband. Anyway, that   s  typical of my life.  Finchum How did you choose law as your profession?  H.G. Tolbert (Laughs) How did I choose law? Boy, you really hit me with a dandy  there. I don   t know. I can   t tell you why I chose law. I mean you   ve  asked me something that boy, you   re digging pretty deep. The law  and   whenever you read the bible, the bible has an awful lot of law. It  tells about law and how you should respect   I wish I could tell you  how. I remember that when I was going through high school on the  debating team they said,    You ought to study law and be a lawyer.    I  remember my answer was,    I don   t want to have to sit around and listen  to peoples    troubles.    I guess I didn   t realize   well, I didn   t at that time,  realize what a wonderful position that put you in, to help people with  their problems and their troubles, was to be a lawyer and to be able to  talk to them in a way that you could back it up and that society as a  whole would back up you   me. It   s a hell of an idea to think that the  world   s going to back you up now doesn   t it?  I   ve sent a lot of people to the penitentiary, really. I remember one that  I   ve often wondered whether I did the right thing or not. This Negro  man had this girl that he was having an affair with. She was just a kid,  you know. The old black women came to me and wanted me to do  something about it. Okay, so I did it. I sent him to the penitentiary. He  only stayed about a year or so. He came back and what did he do? He  married the girl, and they got along great, they had a good family. Did I  9  do what was right in sending him to the penitentiary? Would he have  married her had I not sent him to the penitentiary? Did he have to sit  around there by himself and consider whether or not he really loved her  and wanted her as a wife? I don   t know. I   ve always solved my own  thoughts there by saying,    Well, it gave him time to study it and he did  the right thing.     Finchum You were following the law.  H.G. Tolbert Yeah, and I made a lot of the old black women proud.    That Mr.  Tolbert, he   s not such a bad fellow.     Finchum Was that here in Watonga?  H.G. Tolbert Right.  Finchum How did you choose Tennessee for your law degree?  H.G. Tolbert The school there, money wise I guess, and everything, that would be the  whole   and my folks, we were poor people. We didn   t have a lot. Now,  the world has been good to me financially. I   ve got nearly 1,000 acres  of wheat land, and the world   s been good to me when it came to money  and property, but not so to my parents. They had a different life, so I  don   t know.  Finchum How did you meet your first wife?  H.G. Tolbert She was my secretary when I was county attorney here in Blaine  County.  Finchum Well what about your second one?  H.G. Tolbert I suppose my mother   s death had something to do with that, I don   t  know.  Finchum Are you the first to live to 100? Did your parents make it to 100?  H.G. Tolbert No, no, no, no.  Finchum I know your siblings didn   t     H.G. Tolbert As far as I know I was the only one that made that mistake.  Finchum How did you celebrate?  10  H.G. Tolbert My 100th? I don   t know exactly. All in all, I spent around  10,000  celebrating it.  H. Tolbert No you didn   t  (Laughter)  Finchum You must   ve had a big party.  H.G. Tolbert Didn   t we have a big party?  H. Tolbert We did. (Laughs)  H.G. Tolbert We sure did. My son there, we   ve had a lot of fun together.  Bishop Now as a lawyer and an attorney, did you ever kind of contribute or  serve in politics?  H.G. Tolbert Oh, I served two terms in the House of Representatives as a Republican.  There were only about twenty-two of us in about 110 men there. About  twenty-two of us were Republican at that time. Bill Murray, one of the  ex-governors   me being the low dog on that totem pole there, I sat in  the back row of seats right next to one of the doors. Old Bill Murray, an  ex-governor, he   d come through that door and he   d sit down with me,  so he and I got to be pretty good friends. Bill, he was a character, his  son was our governor at that time. Well...nah.  Finchum No, go ahead.  H. Tolbert Go ahead.  Finchum You can tell us more about Alfalfa Bill if you want.  H.G. Tolbert He was a lot better man than most people gave him credit for being, I   ll  put it that way.  Finchum There   s a building on campus named after him, Murray Hall. Some  people think that wasn   t a good idea.  H.G. Tolbert Well, he was a good man. That   s no mistake, but when you get into  politics people become headstrong and they are always right. You never  saw a politician in your life that wasn   t right.  Finchum So you served two terms in the House? Did you not want to go further  or had had enough?  H.G. Tolbert I had enough.  11  Bishop And you said there were more Democrats than Republicans at that time.  H.G. Tolbert (Laughs) A Republican was thought of, more or less, like a cur dog. A  cur dog gets along pretty well as long as he doesn   t try to get too  friendly with the other dogs.  Finchum That was in the 1950s?  H.G. Tolbert Back in the 40s.  Finchum So when did you retire?  H.G. Tolbert I never have. (Laughter)  Finchum Bad question. (Laughs)  H.G. Tolbert (Laughs) To retire from what? From life?  Finchum Practicing law.  H.G. Tolbert To me that would be a retirement from life. The law and I, I love the  law. You   ve asked me some questions that are pretty tough.  Bishop You   ve written a couple books, can you explain what you   ve wrote?  H.G. Tolbert Bring one of them, Hal.  H. Tolbert I   ll grab it.  H.G. Tolbert That guy there is   now I   ll tell you what. He   s a priest in the   thanks  Hal. That there   s one of the books I wrote, about the town herd. Now  you don   t know what a town herd is   Bishop What is it?  H.G. Tolbert That is a   the people that   I have here two types of herds. A herd of  people and a herd of cattle. The town herd in reality was the milk cows  and back before we had mechanical refrigeration, the best place to keep  the milk was in the cow until you needed it. That   s why we had a town  herd and the people here in town, different ones, would have a milk  cow. Maybe they   d have a little left they   d give it away or something,  maybe a quart now and then. That   s     Finchum Did your folks have a cow in town?  H.G. Tolbert No, we couldn   t afford one.  12  Finchum So you didn   t have to milk one? You didn   t have to milk?  H.G. Tolbert Oh, had a man that ran the   that had a herd of milk cows here. I  worked for him, he also had the ice plant and I worked for him and  helped milk those cows. Course we used milkers   and the ice plant. He  was an old bachelor, he never had children of his own, but every poor  person that come up with a baby, they had milk. Tom Messington was  one of the best men I ever known in my life. He knew how to help  people without groveling in front of them and telling them,    Oh I   m  going to be so good to you.    He   s getting ready to read something that   s  none of his business. (Laughter) Go ahead and read it if you want to.  Bishop I want to know   Watonga is kind of a Native American name, were  there Native Americans here when you were growing up?  H.G. Tolbert We always had Indians, a whole bunch of them. I always had good  friends   one of my best friends in high school was an Indian boy. He  was an artist, I mean a natural-born artist. I understand that he went to  New York whenever he got out of school and up there. Anyway, he  wound up and he came back home and he died a drunk. That   s one of  the bad things that seem to be with our Indians. Firewater and the  Indians didn   t get along.  Finchum So where was your office here in town?  H.G. Tolbert The bank building down on Main Street there, it was up over there. That  was where the lawyers   that was their   they could get up there and  fight and no one cared. (Laughs) I remember one time I was   my office  is right at top of the stairway. Here was my office. We had one man that  was a big man, his office was on the west side as you went down to the  front. He was in my office one day, and we just came out of having a  trial. One of the men in my office was the brother of the man that had  died. This lawyer there didn   t have sense enough to keep his mouth shut  and he started belittling this brother of the man that was sitting there.  Oh God, I   ll never forget that. I was sitting back behind my desk. This  fellow that was the brother of the deceased man, he got up and he said,     Are you calling my brother a liar?    Just the way he said it. He looked  over at that lawyer,    Oh no, no, no, no     I could just see my office just  being absolutely nothing but a junk pile, because this brother was   and  they were from Okeene, and he was of German extraction.    So you   re  calling my brother a liar?    Oh brother. Did I ever tell you about that?  H. Tolbert Was that Graalman? One of the Graalmans?  13  H.G. Tolbert No, they were farmers.  Finchum Did you ever lose a case?  H.G. Tolbert Ever lose a case? (Laughter)  Bishop Maybe we should ask, did you ever win a case?  H.G. Tolbert No. (Laughs) You never (laughs) win or lose.  Bishop Do you have any cases that you were proud of?  H.G. Tolbert Well yeah, a lot of them really and truly. Working for poor people, I  always enjoyed that because I had a place in my heart for poor people,  because the world has always been hard on the poor people, I think.  Much more so than they   like I told you about that old Negro man that  said,    Well sir, the big dog do the barking, but the little dog run out and  do the biting.    That   s the way this   a lot of the big dogs, they do the  barking.  Bishop And that man you met in the Army, is that right?  H.G. Tolbert Oh, in the Army I met a lot of guys.  Bishop This man who told you that the big dogs do the barking?  H.G. Tolbert Oh, yeah. He was   that poor man should   ve never been in the Army.  His mentality was such that he   but we use a draft system here  that   you have to understand the draft system to supply the warrior. I  really felt sorry for an awful lot of the Negroes that I had to deal with in  the Army, because it seemed like they were the ones who really  produced a lot of our problems. Down at Fort Sill we had a lot of little  stores all over the post. Every one of them had a little safe, a cheapie.  About all you had to have to get into it was a pair of pliers and a  screwdriver. The Negroes   it just seemed like that hardly a weekend  would go by but what we didn   t have some Negro that went in and got  into the safe. Course it seemed like I always could find them quick and  do something about it. (Sighs)    All the world   s a stage, and all the men  and women merely players.     Finchum Did you ever think you would make it to 100?  H.G. Tolbert (Laughs) When I was in the Army   well I used to have   something  would hit me in the stomach and I   d just double up like I was having a  heart attack. One day I had gone down to, Fort Sill there, I   d gone down  into Lawton. I had about three or four people with me in the car to do  14  what we had to do. Coming home I had another man driving. See I was  just a private, they put me to work because I   d been a special agent with  the FBI before I went into the Army, and I had the training and  everything that they could use without me even going through      Yes,  Sir     I never did go through boot camp.  Coming back I doubled up and it scared them and they took me to the  hospital. Fortunately a doctor that was in the service from Chicago, and  he took me over and he wanted to put me in the hospital. I said,    No, I  don   t want to go to the hospital. You guys will get a hold of me and sit  me there for thirty days, and you   re not going to put me in the hospital.     He said,    Well, let   s take a look at you.    So he gave me something to  drink and I ended up drinking it and it was fiddling down through me.  He called his nurse,    Nurse, look at this      Here   s what he said,    There is the most perfect intestinal system I   ve  ever seen in my life.    He turned to me and he said,    You   re going to  live to be a ripe old age.    The only thing I asked him was,    Well what   s  the difference between ripe and rotten?    That was my experience with  the doctor. He knew, and I told him that it was nothing new to me. I   d  had it for a long time, those just   boy, just like a heart attack. I haven   t  had those for years, but anyway.  Bishop What   s your secret to longevity?  H.G. Tolbert I would say there is no secret to that. The good Lord knows who to keep  around and who to get rid of. I don   t know whether you believe in the  Lord or not, but that   s up to you. The good Lord cries a lot, yeah I   m  sure that he   s shed a lot of tears over humanity. I mean we   re getting  into something that   s none of your business, but I   m sorry.  Finchum Religion has been an important part of your life?  H.G. Tolbert I would say yes. A very   much more deep-seeded than even my son  knows. If anybody would know it, it   d be him.  Finchum Did you attend church as a youngster with your parents?  H.G. Tolbert Yeah.  Finchum So it goes back that far?  H.G. Tolbert Yeah, I remember my son there was about   it was the first time we   d  gone to church after he was born. The minister was the president of the  Oklahoma City University, who was also a Methodist. I took him up  and presented him to this old preacher. Oh that preacher was just, he  15  was just happy as a lark. He says,    Oh, you know here I am president of  Oklahoma City University and I never get an opportunity like this.    He  blessed my son, and I didn   t know that I was giving him to the Lord for  good because see he now is a minister and that   s his   but he didn   t stay  a Methodist, he went the Orthodox. It separated from the Roman  Catholic Church about the eight or nine-hundreds. A group of those that  didn   t like the Pope telling them what to do and what not to do so they  started their   (laughs) I think that   s really   course they got a better  story than that, but that   s my interpretation. (Laughter) You guys, I  mean, nuts. Don   t you think we   ve talked long enough?  Bishop I   ve got just a couple more questions for you. One you didn   t talk about  too much is what did you used to do for fun as a kid? Were you ever in  the Boy Scouts, ever go to dances?  H.G. Tolbert I was a Boy Scout. Hal, do you know which book? You might     H. Tolbert Fire Mountain?  H.G. Tolbert Now Leona has the full set of them back here, of my books that I   ve  written.  H. Tolbert You want Fire Mountain or     H.G. Tolbert No, Fire Mountain   s a different type of story.  H. Tolbert It doesn   t mention your scouting.  Bishop But you were a Boy Scout     H.G. Tolbert And a scoutmaster later. I did a lot of work with the scouts. Go ahead  and get that book. In my estimation Boy Scouting is one of the best  institutions there is for boys. One of the     Bishop Legend of Fire Mountain, is that a real place?  H.G. Tolbert (Laughs)  Finchum 1927.  H.G. Tolbert The picture, yes, the picture is real.  Bishop But this is more fiction?  H.G. Tolbert That picture is right out north of town here. I took that picture on the  front of that book when I was about, a Boy Scout, thirteen or fourteen  16  with an old box camera. It was always such a, to my mind, it was the  book. I don   t know why, it just always stayed with me.  Finchum Says you took the oath when you were twelve in 1927. Then you were an  Eagle Scout, Council board member, Order of the Arrow     Bishop There   s a lot to do for a scout in this part of Oklahoma.  H.G. Tolbert I never have been able to understand   there   s one thing   you know the  National Association   well sports, they foster organizations, Boys and  Girls Clubs, which I think is a   I don   t know that much about Boys and  Girls Clubs. When you go to trying to put boys and girls together in  some kind of thing, I don   t go for that. Until a marriage takes place  between a man and a woman, they can have their associations and all  that, but whenever you go to bring them together into an association  that is so close you got to be careful. You   ve been there. And you  probably had some ideas that weren   t worth a damn at that time, but  you show me right now, you   re telling me right now without voice that  you knew how to handle it. You   ve got a nice dimple. (Laughter)  Bishop I want to know when history is written, what do you want it to say about  you? How do you want to be remembered?  H.G. Tolbert I want them to say,    Hod Tolbert was born out in the west side of  Blaine County, he died in Blaine County, and that   s about all there is to  it. Goodbye.     Finchum Hod? Hod, is that a nickname?  H.G. Tolbert H-O-D, that   s a nickname. That comes from when I was little   Course  I wasn   t too bright, but people would ask me what my name was. Well,  for some reason, I don   t know why, but I was little and I didn   t  understand. I thought they were asking,    How do you greet somebody?        Well, howdy  Howdy, howdy.    The word    howdy    went down to Hod.  They   d ask me what my name was and I   d tell them, I   d say,    Well, hi      But they thought it was my name, see? Now was that dumbness on my  part or dumbness on their part?  Finchum (Laughs) Maybe a little bit of both. I take the middle path here.  H.G. Tolbert Oh, the world   s a wonderful place, isn   t it?  Bishop Yep.  Finchum How do you spend a typical day now? What do you do during a typical  day now? How early do you get up?  17  H.G. Tolbert Oh, typical day. A typical day for a person that   s over 100 years old is  not too enjoyable really and truly. First thing I do, get me some  breakfast, and eat it, got a backroom back there. What they call a  sunroom, which is stupid to have a sunroom on the west side of your  house, but anyway. I go out there and go back to sleep.  Finchum What time do you get up from bed?  H.G. Tolbert Usually it   s around six o   clock.  Finchum What time do you go to bed?  H.G. Tolbert Anywhere from nine to two o   clock in the morning.  Finchum You don   t always get eight hours then.  H.G. Tolbert I try to get eight hours, yes.  Finchum And do you read much during the day?  H.G. Tolbert Yes, if I   ve got something I like. Yes, read, yes. Or right now that I own  some land that an oil company wants to put some   well, use it for a  gathering system I guess you   d call it. I   ve put in here lately, I   ve been  putting in a lot of time on that, too much time really and truly. Now  they   re paying a pretty good price for it, but I personally, for the good  of my land, I think I   d rather it didn   t happen. It   ll be between eight and  ten thousand dollars that they   ll pay me. As far as anybody driving  along, they can   t tell whether it   s used or not. You   re not interested in  that.  Finchum Having to read legal documents then?  H.G. Tolbert Very seldom. I don   t, no.  Finchum Do you have a favorite author or genre?  H.G. Tolbert (Points to self)  Bishop You   re the best author.  H. Tolbert I don   t think that   s what he meant. (Laughter)  Finchum A little PR doesn   t hurt, does it?  H.G. Tolbert It really doesn   t.  18  H. Tolbert Who   s your favorite poet?  H.G. Tolbert My favorite poet? I don   t know, Hal. Probably Tennyson. That   s a hard  question.  H. Tolbert Not Robert Service?  Bishop Do you have a favorite poem?  H.G. Tolbert Oh, let   s don   t get into all that.  Bishop You quoted Shakespeare,    All the world   s a stage.    You must like  Shakespeare, too.  H.G. Tolbert Course no one can take the place of Shakespeare, no one.  Bishop That   s true.  Finchum Have you read the Louis L   Amour books?  H.G. Tolbert The what?  Finchum Louis L   Amour.  H.G. Tolbert No.  Finchum A lot of our centenarians, that   s their favorite.  H. Tolbert Not his style.  H.G. Tolbert Did you read it?  H. Tolbert Oh yeah, but     H.G. Tolbert It didn   t     H. Tolbert    you always told me I was wasting my time reading that kind of  literature. (Laughs)  H.G. Tolbert You   ve wasted a lot of your time.  H. Tolbert I certainly have, and other peoples    too. (Laughter) What about    Flower  in a Crannied Wall   ?  H.G. Tolbert Yeah.  19  H. Tolbert Can you recite that? Do you remember?  H.G. Tolbert Yeah.  Finchum I   ve never heard that.  H. Tolbert    Flower in a Crannied Wall.     H.G. Tolbert That   s the story that has to do with Jesus, doesn   t it?  Bishop    Flower in a Crannied Wall,    I   ve never heard of that.  H. Tolbert Coleridge, right? Didn   t Coleridge write that poem?  Alfred Lord  Tennyson   H.G. Tolbert You know, I don   t know. I don   t know, but I think that   s right. Poetry  has played quite a   it   s played quite a part in my life. I   ve got a lot of  poetry out there in my computer that I   ve written. Did I ever give you a  copy of that?  H. Tolbert Yes.  H.G. Tolbert I thought I did.  Finchum So you actually use a computer?  H.G. Tolbert Yeah.  Finchum I   m impressed.  H.G. Tolbert Actually I think the computer uses me, it   s a two-way street. I would  say so, I don   t know. Boy, that computer is quite a piece of machinery.  Bishop What do you consider the greatest invention, the greatest invention  ever?  Finchum During your lifetime.  Bishop Yeah, in your lifetime.  H.G. Tolbert I suppose the computer has affected humanity more than anything else  that I can think of right off the top. I mean, as a piece of machinery. I   m  so proud of my son   s life, it   s hard for me to   in my estimation, well of  course the Christianity is and its philosophy of love for people, and love  for each other, is the only thing that man should even consider. I mean  20  in my estimation, because without love there is no reason, nothing. Like  I love both of you people, not because you   re here giving me problems,  (laughs) but that   s why I forgive you.  H. Tolbert (Laughs)  Finchum I see where your daughter gets her orneriness. (Laughs)  Bishop It   s not every day you get forgiven and get loved in one day. (Laughter)  Finchum Is there anything else you want to say before we close?  H.G. Tolbert No, what else do you want to know? I think you   ve got a pretty good  idea.  Bishop (Laughs) I think we   ve got a pretty good idea   Finchum Watonga   s changed a lot during your lifetime, hasn   t it?  H.G. Tolbert Oh boy, it sure has.  Finchum You said it had an ice plant at one time.  H.G. Tolbert Oh yes, yeah.  Finchum Did it have theaters?  H.G. Tolbert Yes. The fact is we had a man that had two theaters here. Like high  school, I went through high school here, and every year each year had  to put on a play. I was the lead man in every one of them. I loved to  entertain people in the right way.  Finchum That may be why you chose law.  H.G. Tolbert When I was in high school they told me,    Oh, you should be a lawyer   Blah, blah       I remember my answer was,    I don   t want to spend my  life sitting around listening to peoples    troubles.    But I couldn   t help it.  When I really found out what the law was, and you read the Bible, and  boy did they refer to the law. They always go   the law.  Finchum I mean they say the courtroom is like a stage.  H.G. Tolbert In a lot of ways that   s true, yes.  Finchum You   re just entertaining the truth I guess, trying to.  21  H.G. Tolbert Of course law should be based on the truth, and all decisions should be  based on truth even if it   s not very nice, because there   s nothing but the  honest truth that will save humanity from just complete failure. Right  now we have a fight between Christianity and another worldly religion,  that the United States as a government cannot take sides, because in our  constitution we believe in freedom of religion. That's one thing that can  ruin the United States as a government, in my estimation, because any  religion that isn   t based on love for each other is a hell of a mess. You  believe me, don   t you? I can tell from the looks on his face that he was  thinking I was just stupid as   that   s alright. (Laughter)  Bishop Absolutely not.  Finchum I think we   ll end right there then. Thank you for having us today, it   s  been a pleasure.  Bishop I   m just amazed that at 100 you   re up to date with all the current  events.  -------  -------
