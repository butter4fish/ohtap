Speaker 1: And I'd like to have your profession?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I'm a lawyer by training, an academic lawyer really.  But now, I'm in the broadcasting business, the radio business.
Story_ID: 6216
Speaker 1: We start out with five questions.  They're a little 'People' magazine-ish, if you just bear with me.  I'd like to know what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?  All food (laughs).  I love food, okay.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I'm very flexible.  I enjoy--each season brings a different experience.  And so I love the seasons.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No, not, not particularly.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: I'm eclectic.  I like different places for different, different kinds of experiences.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, not really--not that I'm aware of.  Perhaps, I do, but I'm not aware of it.
Story_ID: 6217
Speaker 1: Okay, I want to start out by asking you about your father.  I know, you know, you have an adopted father, but I'd like to have your, your, you know, your birth father's name?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I really didn't know him, you know.  I was two years of age when he died.  I was fundamentally raised by my adopted father [James Davenport].  Now, there's always a tension between adopted children and--pardon me, between stepchildren and their, and their stepparents.  And I was very, I was never very happy with him, never enamored in that sense.  But I grew, as I got older, to appreciate the talents and the skills that he had, which is why when he contracted cancer and was dying, I decided at my suggestion to, to adopt his name.
Speaker 1: And your mother, can you tell us about her, her background and her name, give her name and what you know about--?
Speaker 2: Her name is Beatrice McClemore Davenport, was born in South Carolina in 1917, came north in 1922 with, with her parents.  My mother's a very smart woman, a very attractive woman and very independent.  She was the very first person in, in our family to finish high school.  She worked for the government for many, many years and was very successful in that regard.
Speaker 1: Did she ever share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really, we, we--well, my mother had seven sisters and one brother.  It was a very close-knit family, most of whom lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] but some lived in New York [New York].  And then we talked somewhat about our, the time when she was very--my, my mother was ill for a number of years with tuberculosis.  So from 1941 until about 1946, she was in a sanatorium.
Speaker 1: And that was during your--you were a young person then, right?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Very much so, I was being raised then by my grandmother, Ethel McClemore.
Speaker 1: And did Ethel McClemore have influence on you?
Speaker 2: She, she was a devoutly religious woman, who was a, a good grandmother and a, a good person, who set very high standards for me and for the rest of the family.
Story_ID: 6218
Speaker 1: And let's--let me ask you about your first, what you recall as your first memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My first memory of growing up, depending upon how one uses that term, was trying to read, read a newspaper, the '[Philadelphia] Daily News' in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I didn't have the vocabulary to speak of, so I would make up the words.
Speaker 1: Do you know how old you were about then?
Speaker 2: Four and a half, about that.
Speaker 1: And where did you live and what street were you--did you live on?
Speaker 2: We lived at 12th [Street] and Master [Street] which is in north Philadelphia.  When I was six years of age and, and my mother [Beatrice McClemore Davenport] was in the sanatorium, my grandmother [Ethel McClemore] moved us to the, the original public housing projects which were called Richard Allen Homes.  And I could remember that it was--when I was six years of age, getting lost because all the apartments looked the same.
Speaker 1: And tell me, you were the only child--?
Speaker 2: The only child.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so can you just sort of describe, sort of family life or home life or even the time, like living with your grandmother and what that period was like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was a warm and loving and nurturing environment.  We had lots of friends, and as I said, my mother's family, my grandmother, was very large.  And so there were people coming by all the time.  And it was very supportive, you know.  I, I was a fairly outgoing child--even though I had a stammer, I was still talkative.  And they encouraged me to really do whatever I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: And so you weren't conscious of your stammer, even as a young--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Oh, very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's like, and, of course, I was conscious of it.  And people were just amazed.  My cousins used to say, "You stammer when you talk, but you don't stammer when you sing" (laughs).  I don't know if there's some, some correlation between the two.  But I was very conscious of it.  But in the--say being an active child, I determined that I was not gonna let my stammering stop me from doing the things that I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 6219
Speaker 1: Now, what things sort of--like, you said you were an outgoing child, and I'm just--were you an introspective child, were you a mischievous child, were you, you know, were you--?
Speaker 2: I was all of the above--as I said, somewhat eclectic.  I could be thoughtful and, and bright and write poetry and draw, or I could be out playing with the kids and being--having to be dragged into the house at night.  I was a mixed bag, frankly.
Speaker 1: I'd like you to take yourself back to those early years, and I'd like you to even just sort of talk about or describe what sights, smells and sounds remind you of your childhood, of, you know, growing up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's kind of hard to say.  It was a, Philadelphia is an unusual environment.  It was, you know, the public housing project [Richard Allen Homes] was substantially segregated and so it was mostly black.  My elementary school [Spring Garden School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was mostly black, like 98 percent.  We--there were--I had a few white friends, young guys who lived in the neighborhood.  And it was a very tough neighborhood.  There were gangs and, and difficulties.  And we had to know, we had to learn how to protect ourselves.  You know, you'd go to the store for your mother and with a dollar.  You'd put the dollar in your shoe so it wouldn't be taken from you, or you wouldn't be beaten up.  And on occasion, we had to--my friends and I, we had to protect our, our white friends from, from the gangs.  So it's--I've always said that where I grew up, being white was no advantage.
Speaker 1: And was it--so where you grew up, was there any mixture to it, or were this--were--?
Speaker 2: It was about 98 percent black.
Speaker 1: It's black, okay.
Speaker 2: The whites there were, you know, they were merchants, the milkman, the insurance man and so forth and so on, but the people who lived there were 98 percent black.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you describe--did you--would you say you lived on a block in Richard Allen or it just a whole series of apartments like most--can you--I'm just--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well, but--.
Speaker 1: Your neighbors is what I'm--?
Speaker 2: No, and there wasn't, and there wasn't a neighbor, neighborhood, but the, the way that Richard Allen was devised was to have everyone looking inward.  In other words, the, I was--we were at 12th [Street] and Parrish [Street] is the street, but rather than having the houses face 12th Street, the backyards faced 12th Street and the house, and the front--houses entered from a courtyard.  So it was like a courtyard.  So, and I was told many, many, many, many years later there was a big battle about that, and that there was, there was an argument about having the houses--not creating such a confined community, inward-looking community, but an outward-looking community.  But the, the people who were making the decisions decided to the contrary, to have it looking inward rather than outwards.
Speaker 1: And, you know, back to, any smells that remind you of your, you know, growing up?  Food or--?
Speaker 2: Nothing, no, I can't, no, I can't think about any, no.  You know, the, the sounds were the sound of the street vendors.  They were on, on push cart, in push carts and in horse and wagons, singing, you know, selling fruit and that of thing.  But no, no smells in that sense.
Story_ID: 6220
Speaker 1: Can you share with us some, just even anecdotes of times, you know, whether they were around, let's say elementary school or, you know, or home life or church or, you know, or special occasions?
Speaker 2: Well, but, I think the first special occasion was that I had an elementary school teacher in the fourth grade, it was 1946.  And he went to see Jackie Robinson [baseball player] play, and he came back--he was a male.  And he came back to tell us what a wonderful thing that was, what a wonderful experience for him.  And I can remember some time around the same time, around that same year for whatever reason, I decided I wanted to go to college.
Speaker 1: And you don't know--?
Speaker 2: I don't know why.  I mean I really don't know why, but I determined at that time, and when I was about ten or eleven, and probably around ten, that I wanted to go to college.
Speaker 1: Did you know anyone in the neighborhood who had gone to college or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And subsequent thereto, I had a cousin who went to college, but no.
Speaker 1: Any other--now, you went to Spring Garden Elementary School.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you--were there any teachers that influenced you there or any--?
Speaker 2: Well, at Spring Garden [School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was the, the black male that I told you about, who was, who had told us about seeing Jackie Robinson play baseball.  Now, that's the most significant event that, that I can recall there.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what was significant about it?  Was it the manner of his voice, or the description of what happened when he went to the game or--?
Speaker 2: I think the emotion that he felt, you know, that he was effective in communicating to us, not in the sense of saying that we should be proud or, you know, this is a great and glorious day, but just the fact that, that Robinson was there.
Speaker 1: And then you went to junior high, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And can you give the name of that junior high?
Speaker 2: Stoddart-Fleisher [Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  It was really the Charles T. Stoddart Junior High, excuse me, and then it was merged with Fleisher and became Stoddart-Fleisher because the schools were crowded.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how close was that to Spring Garden and is--?
Speaker 2: It was about thirteen blocks.  It was a healthy walk from, from my house in, in Richard Allen [Homes housing projects] to Stoddart-Fleisher.  I walked it every day and back.
Story_ID: 6221
Speaker 1: And are you, at this point in time, are there, you know, what else--what is catching your interests?  Are you, you know, you've said that, you know, your first memory that you can think of is trying to read the newspaper.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And I mean are you, you know, reading?  What are you taking in as a young person and what is influencing you?
Speaker 2: There are a lot of mixed messages in, in the neighbor--in north Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at that time.  There were the gangs and the fights, that you tried to avoid like the plague.  So there, there--and coming from a very devoutly religious family, you know, in my family, it was such that you don't stand on corners, because then you were a bum.  And so at that time in my life, I'd say that it was avoiding the difficulties of the, the tough neighborhood we were in.  Academically, it was a mixed bag.  And I think that was more because from elementary school on, I thought of myself as being reasonably smart.  And so therefore, I never had to work very hard.  And I didn't.  So I'd do very well sometimes, and not so well the others.
Speaker 1: And how were made aware that you were sort of smart?  Is it just--?
Speaker 2: Well, you learn--I mean you, because you were quick to come up with the answers, you know.  I was one of those kids in elementary school that had my hand up, you know, with the answer.  And then I realized that I knew the answer faster than, than most people.  And so, you know, and so I gained a sense of academic confidence I think early on.
Speaker 1: Okay, and were there teachers that, let's say even in junior high, that sort of took you under their wing?  Or you think--.
Speaker 2: No, (shaking head no).
Speaker 1: So that's some of the mixed messaging.  It wasn't like anyone was nurturing you?
Speaker 2: No, I, no--I was not the kind of kid that people said, well, he's so wonderful and he's so smart, we want to help him, because I, I'd, my mannerisms--well, not my mannerisms, my dress reflected the neighborhood.  And, and that was a tough neighborhood because you had to look the part or else, you, you had problems.
Speaker 1: And did you yourself get into fights or felt pressure to join a gang, did you--or were you part of a gang, a local gang?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't part of a gang.  I never felt any pressure--I never got into any fights.  I, for the most part, avoided it, you know.  And there were times when it was more difficult than others.  There'd--we--you know, there would be gangs standing on the corners and you wouldn't want to go by them because then you'd have to fight.  But every once and a while, you know, I'd just get tired and I'd just go and, and take my chances.
Story_ID: 6222
Speaker 1: And, and you said church was a major part.  What denomination?
Speaker 2: Baptist.  We had, every Sunday was church and Bible School and church camp, I mean I, I did the whole number.  I was raised in the church.
Speaker 1: And B-Y--is it B--?
Speaker 2: Baptist Youth Fellowship, or BYP [sic, BYPU, Baptist Young Peoples Union].
Speaker 1: Right, and did you--who was, what did church did you go to and who--?
Speaker 2: St. Paul Baptist Church in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  The Pastor was E. Luther Cunningham.  And Reverend Cunningham was a graduate of Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], and a very smart man, very articulate.  And he also had a stammer, which was funny, which he did not have when he preached.
Speaker 1: And so you were there--just so people understand, I mean black Baptist churches, you're there usually all day--.
Speaker 2: All day long (laughs), all day long, that's--absolutely.  The Sunday school, then church and then Baptist Youth Fellowship in the evening and, you know, and so it was a, it was a full day's experience.
Speaker 1: And do you have like any, you know, favorite spirituals or things to this day, if you hear them, they sort of bring you back, 'cause church music has changed a lot now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's different, very different, to put it mildly.  No, not in--I mean, I loved spirituals, you know.  And I loved hearing the chorus.  We, we had an anthem chorus, and we also had a gospel chorus.  We had no--the only musical instrument, of course, was the, was the organ or piano and that was it.  Now, they have guitars and saxophones, but that was not my, my experience.
Speaker 1: But you don't have any, like music that takes you back--?
Speaker 2: I should I love music, so I love all kinds--I'm a--I love classics, I love rhythm & blues, I love country and western, I love polkas.  I, I have a very eclectic taste in music.  So there's no--I can't say that there's one hymn or one spiritual that touches me much more so than others.  I just love music.
Story_ID: 6223
Speaker 1: And were you active in the church--I mean active in the church in any particular thing, organization--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Not in any meaning way, other than going to the Cub Scouts, you know, but not in any meaningful way.  And, you know, as I said I, I was sometimes very much involved in things and other times not.  I, I was very much a child of the neighborhood, very much.  And also, and also we did a lot of sports, you know, basketball, touch, touch football, yeah, baseball, you know.  And it was a whole different kind of a ballgame.  It's--in order to, to be accepted and to survive in a, in a tough neighborhood, you have to be able to present yourself in a certain way.  And, and I did.
Speaker 1: Well, describe that for, you know, so people just understand.  I mean kids have to present them--still themselves today in a certain way, but--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's correct.
Speaker 1: But then, what were the--?
Speaker 2: It's more of a swagger.  See, it's more the, you--standing up and how you looked in terms of people, so that people would know that you could, you could defend yourself, you see.  You could not be a goody, goody two shoes or else you would have many problems.
Speaker 1: And that's what you, you--were you learning about even being a--is that how being sort of a man, or manhood was presenting itself through those?
Speaker 2: I can't say that's how manhood was presenting, I'd say that's how the environment presented itself, you know, that--you know, we, we used to box.  And you had to be able to, to fight.  But, but in our neighborhood, the fights and some quite often took the (unclear)--took the manner of a boxing match--body boxing matches, body punching matches.  And, you know, we would go at it.  And that would establish who was the stronger or the better person--or better fighter anyway.
Story_ID: 6224
Speaker 1: And were there any people that were sort of--adults that were catching your attention in terms of you wanted to be like them or--?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my family was very active in, in the church in leadership roles.  This goes back to, you know, when I was in, you know, the third and fourth grade.  And they would--they were the leaders in the churches--the leaders of their particular clubs.  And so that I sort of expected that, as a, as a family member, that I should also be a leader.
Speaker 1: And so what were you--so, you felt that, one, you had decided you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then, two, you were deciding that you wanted to be a leader?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--.
Speaker 2: And that was because of the influence of my family.  See, my was a very ordinary family.  As I said, my mother [Beatrice McClemore Davenport] was the first one to finish high school and I was the first one to, to go to college.  But they were the leaders in their respective communities.  I'm told that my grandfather, who was uneducated totally, when he walked down the street, you know, the, the people would just sort of bow with respect for him.  But he was uneducated, and the folks would stop the use of, you know, vile language cause he was so highly respected.
Speaker 1: And this was the grandfather of the grandmother that you lived with?
Speaker 2: This was the husband of my grandmother [Ethel McClemore].
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Okay.
Story_ID: 6225
Speaker 1: Now, do you--one thing I want to get, when your mother [Beatrice McClemore Davenport] came out of the sanatorium, were you, do you remember life sort of changing at that point and what--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, completely, because I went to live with my mother and then my stepfather who was James Davenport.  And so it was a whole different experience cause we were just, then just the three of us.
Speaker 1: And then you said, you know, the tension that sort of exists between that--so was he a strict disciplinarian himself?
Speaker 2: No, because he wasn't my father, so he couldn't discipline me, you see.  It was more of the, sort of nascent ambition that was in me in terms of what I thought we should be doing, what my mother should be doing, whatever I thought he should be doing.  And it wasn't happening, and I was very disappointed.
Speaker 1: So what were you thinking that everyone should be doing?
Speaker 2: Better.  Better, you see, and doing--.
Speaker 1: And you're what age at this point?
Speaker 2: Ten, eleven.
Speaker 1: And so what were you--what did you say that everyone needed to do, like your mother?  What should she have been doing?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I couldn't verbalize it, but I just thought that we should be doing better.  And now, I, I was a young child.  I, I always thought--I don't, I don't know why I said this, but I always said that I would very well.  I knew I would do very well, and I would make a lot of money, and that, you know, and that I'd pay everybody back.
Speaker 1: And are you reading things at this point or you're--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I'm reading, I'm reading a lot, but mostly fictions.
Speaker 1: But what fiction, do you remember, just fiction?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, like, actually, mostly, by this time, I'm moving toward mostly sports books, sports heroes and that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you have a favorite sport at the time or a favorite hero?
Speaker 2: No, not really, you know.  Not, at the--not at this time in my life, no.
Speaker 1: Now, you--so you're not sure where this is coming from internally?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No.
Speaker 1: You just know that, you know, this is sort of, you have this driving ambition and you want to, you know, to make things happen.  That's forming.
Speaker 2: I won't, I won't call it a driving ambition, because I wasn't doing very much about it.  I'll call it ambition that was unfocused at that particular time, without knowing exactly what to really do with it, and so there was a latent, I would think, ambition.
Story_ID: 6226
Speaker 1: Now, are you, with courses in school, are you focused on those and you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, not really focused because, you know, I normally did very well.
Speaker 1: It didn't matter, okay.
Speaker 2: So, I mean I was not, I was not considered one of the intellectual elites of the class 'cause I never worked that hard, you know, no.  But I always held my own.  I was always a good B student.
Speaker 1: And so when--in high school, give the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: West Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, now were you, you know, I think I had read that you became class vice president?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And what year were you class vice president?
Speaker 2: My junior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then treasurer of the graduating class.  But high school was, was where the, the latent ambition became focused, see.  I knew I wanted to go to college and finally decided that perhaps I should be a consistently good student, rather than an inconsistent student.  And I had played high school football and so, high school was where the focus began to, to manifest itself.
Speaker 1: And what position did you play?
Speaker 2: I played defensive end.
Speaker 1: And was your team a good team, was it a good team?
Speaker 2: No, it was (laughs)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay, it was just--.
Speaker 2: I was a place kicker, and because of then, but I always, I always brag, I got one football scholarship to, to play for Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  I didn't go, but I, I--that's my badge of honor as an ex-football player.
Speaker 1: Now, and can you describe though for people who don't know Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] what, what West Philadelphia High School was like at that time?
Speaker 2: West Philadelphia High School at that time was 50 percent black, 48 percent Jewish, and 2 percent everybody else.
Speaker 1: But this was the first time you were in a mixed environment so to speak?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No, we, we--.
Speaker 1: Was Stoddart [Fleisher Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] like--?
Speaker 2: Stoddart was probably 20 percent white, 20, 25 percent white.  West Philadelphia was 50-50, basically.
Speaker 1: And this is--we're in probably the early '50s [1950s], right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And are you aware of your sort of, you know, environment more in terms of what is happening beyond your sort of local, you know, you know--your local--you know, teenagers can be sort of self absorbed--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 2: But are you aware what's going on, you know, in the rest of Philadelphia or--.
Speaker 1: Not particularly.  You know, we, by that time I'm focused in trying to be a success in high school, running for the class offices, playing football, working part-time after school so that I, I didn't have to brown bag it to lunch, and so that I could buy the clothes that I wanted and so forth.  So I'm fairly focused on putting myself in the environment, in the circumstances that, that I aspired to.
Speaker 2: And what was an example of your circumstance that you aspired to?  Did you--?
Speaker 1: Well, by that, I said earlier on, I wanted to go to college and, and so I began to date girls whose parents had gone to college, which was a whole different ballgame, whole different ballgame even, that you meet people, that they would say not, if you're going to college, "What college do you plan to go to."  And it was just a whole different social environment, a whole different, different set of expectations.
Speaker 2: And what did you find, how did you find those families different from your family or your or, you know, that's--?
Speaker 1: You know, and the fundamental difference is I think exposure, in the things that they had done and 'cause they were, for the most part, educated families, so they had been exposed to a lot, lot of different things.  They--my family is a family of readers, so they, they read a lot, which was a good thing.  But I think these families read different books than--most of the time than my folks.
Speaker 2: And are you--so you become class vice president.  And what is that, you ran for office?
Speaker 1: I was elected by the student body.
Speaker 2: And do you remember who you ran against?
Speaker 1: Not at all.
Speaker 2: Okay, not all.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Not at all (laughs).
Speaker 2: Okay, do you remember what motivated you to win?  I mean to run, sorry?
Speaker 1: The, I, I wanted to be a leader, as I said.  I, and around the third or fourth grade, I realized that my family was a family of leaders within their environment, and therefore I had the expectations--expectation that I should be a leader as well.  And after I became focused, which is really around the tenth grade, in terms of school and what I was about and what I had to do to, to go to college and to accomplish the things that I wanted to accomplish, then I--a part of that was being a leader.
Speaker 2: And with being focused, were there subjects that you were doing better in than, as opposed to, you know, other subjects?  Were you better in math and science or?
Speaker 1: I was fairly, the only thing I wasn't good in was languages.  But everything else, yeah.  I wasn't much of a science person though, but I did it.  But I, I had no interest in it.
Story_ID: 6227
Speaker 1: And so at what point do you decide what college you're--you know, and what colleges are you looking at, and, you know, at what point do you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was my senior year in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so what colleges do you decide that you're going to look at?
Speaker 2: Well, we--I really only applied to, I think three schools, or maybe two, as I recollect.  That was Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] and Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I had no desire to go to Temple because that was in, in town.  I thought that college was being away, being in a small town somewhere.  So the only school I really wanted to go to was, was Penn State.
Story_ID: 6228
Speaker 1: So you apply--tell me the schools you applied for.  You got the football scholarship from--?
Speaker 2: From Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  And I, Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] was really my only choice because I, got what was an early admission to Penn State.  And so therefore, it was very where I was going.
Speaker 1: And you said that you had read about it, you know, you had been very aware of Penn State from the sports pages?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  I'd not seen the campus so I didn't know very much about its academic reputation.  I just knew that it was a big school.  I wanted to go to a large school and I wanted to be away from home.  And Penn State fit, the bill.
Speaker 1: And why was the focus on a large school?  Why do you think there was that?
Speaker 2: Because I, frankly probably thought a large school was better.
Speaker 1: Now, so do you go--so you apply, you get accepted--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And there's, is there a great sense of anticipation on the part of your family that, you know, that here it is, Ron's going off to, you know, to college?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) To college?  Well, I had been talking about it all my life.  So it was not like this was something new.  And it was like, it was an expectation, you see, and my mother [Beatrice McLemore Davenport] got, and was very ill at the time before I started college.  And I can remember her saying to my aunt, "You know, you got to help Ron go to college because it'll break his heart if he doesn't go to college," and she subsequently recovered.  So she was fine, but, you know, it was just the expectation.  And I won't, I mean if, I was all--my ideas were always different.  I was always saying different things.  I was very aggressive, as I said, I became a high school leader and I worked hard.  So I, was always just a little bit different, but very focused.
Speaker 1: Now, when you, you arrived at Penn State sight unseen?
Speaker 2: Sight unseen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is, my father [James Davenport] drove myself and my roommate, who was Matt Robinson, who was the original Gordon [television character] on 'Sesame Street' [television program].  We were friends in high school and college.  And my father drove us to Penn State and dropped us off and turned around and drove back.  It was the first time either of us had ever been to Penn State.
Story_ID: 6229
Speaker 1: Now, the question I have, that's a different environment than you've grown up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--.
Speaker 2: It was 1954 then, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, I mean but it's also just different.  It's, you know--,
Speaker 2: Oh, hugely, hugely.
Speaker 1: So can you describe that because you're really sort of a city kid.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And Penn--and if you, just for, you know, people who don't know where Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] is located and it's up in the hills--.
Speaker 2: It's in University Park or State College, PA [Pennsylvania].  At that time, it was a large school of eleven thousand students.  Now, that's considered relatively small.  But--because Penn State is now forty-some odd thousand students.  But it was eleven thousand students.  I can remember that my friend Matt Robinson and I, we were driven to campus on a Monday, pardon me, Sunday, dropped off, unpacked our bags.  And on Monday, we went walking around town, State College, PA.  And we saw white men sweeping the streets.  And we turned to each other, and said, "We are a long way from home."  (Laughs)  So it was culture shock, frankly.
Speaker 1: And how many blacks were in the, you know, in your class coming in?  Do you know or the black population?
Speaker 2: I don't--about seven or eight, and I think, but the total population, black population at Penn State was about 120, out of the 11,000 students.
Speaker 1: So this is miniscule and tiny.
Speaker 2: Oh, terrible and it was--you know, and it was culture shock because the--Penn State at that time was a very social school.  They had gorgeous fraternity houses, and the social life, and it, well, girls had hours, of course.  But social life revolved around going to basketball games on a Saturday night and then going to the, fraternity house and parties and so forth and so on.  And that was all new for us, of course.  But the blacks were, such a small group of people, and when I, we first got there, there were no black fraternity houses and integration had not hit Penn State in the sense of blacks joining white fraternities, in the sense of blacks being social guests at white fraternities.  Now, there were, was a--Jesse Arnelle, he was an athlete, who was the president of the university when we got there.  Jesse had like sort of an acceptability in terms of the general populous.  But it was still very much, we--black folks, were very much removed from the mainstream, the social mainstream.  Penn State, though, was very accepting in all other ways.  You know, I, ran for, business student council, as a freshman, a first-semester freshman. And, asked my teachers if I could get up and campaign in the classrooms.  And they, and they did, and they allowed me to make my little campaign speeches.  So I've said to people, Penn State is what you make it.  But socially, it was a very difficult environment for us and for me particularly.
Story_ID: 6230
Speaker 1: And things like, you know, I know that times have changed, but I mean, things like where to get your hair cut and all of that, I mean--.
Speaker 2: There was a black barber in town [State College, Pennsylvania], who looked white (laughs), but we could go there to get haircuts.
Speaker 1: And was there much of a black community there at all, if there was the black barber?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: None.  In Bellefonte [Pennsylvania], which is about ten miles away, there was a very, very small black community, but and we didn't have cars, and that was ten miles away.
Speaker 1: And, so you arrive on this campus [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania], it's really much different than what you've, you know, anticipated.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's much different than what you've experienced to date.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, sorry.
Speaker 2: That's right because, you remember, college was about being in a small town.  In, the '50s [1950s], college was about being in a small town.  And, you know, so therefore, it was everything that I anticipated in that regard.  You wanted to be removed.  See, you were not looking to replicate the city experience.  But the social adjustment was very difficult.
Speaker 1: And did you find yourself, were you able to go back and forth to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], or that was not really--?
Speaker 2: Couldn't, we couldn't afford to.  You went home on, vacations, Thanksgiving, Christmas, midterm break and Easter, and that was it.
Speaker 1: And so did you bond closer with your, you know, friend at that point?
Speaker 2: Matt [Robinson]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Matt.
Speaker 2: Well, no, we bonded with everybody black (laughs), and they were such a rare experience that we spoke to every black person that we would see, whether we knew them or not.  I mean we automatically spoke.
Speaker 1: And was it a cohesive black community because I'm just saying this because sometimes when blacks are in that, you know, large a white environment, sometimes, the bonding, sometimes is difficult, some time.
Speaker 2: That's hard for me to imagine because you remember that the, social life for the most part was--we were removed from the mainstream of the social life.  And so we had no choice but be a cohesive unit.
Story_ID: 6231
Speaker 1: And now what are you deciding that you want to be, you know, major in?
Speaker 2: Now, I was, I was in the [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] college of business administration.  In the '50s [1950s], those of us who went to college, black or white, wanted to just graduate from college and get a college degree and go to work for some large corporation.  And for those of us with ambition, you join a corporation and become a CEO [chief executive officer] at some time in our careers.  So I, registered in the college of business administration and took the courses there.
Speaker 1: And do you remember--but how did you get to economics, is what I'm wondering?
Speaker 2: Because I found the other courses uninteresting (laughs).  I thought, I'd worked as a stock boy in John Wanamaker's [department store] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] between high school and college.  So I thought I would try merchandising and marketing, but it was a boring course.  The economics course was, with an interest and challenging.  So I just started taking more and more of those courses.
Speaker 1: And at what point did you declare a major in economics?
Speaker 2: In my junior year.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was it about economics that sort of appealed to you, you know, was it the theory of it?  Was it, you know, sort of understanding structures and how things sort of work?
Speaker 2: I really can't answer.  I just found it interesting, you know.  It was a, challenge.  It was a theory course, rather than a math course, which it is now.  And I just, I, found it very interesting.  It's--you know, economics is a correlation of seeming unrelated events, and I liked putting those kind of things together.
Story_ID: 6232
Speaker 1: And you had, you got--now, was it at, you know, at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] you were part of some societies and groups though, right?
Speaker 2: Right, I was a campus leader at that time.  I--we have honorary societies for your junior and senior year.  And then, and those societies were, called hat societies because we walked around, would you believe it, in black hats with symbols on them, excuse me.  And I was in Androcles Junior Mens' Society, Skull and Bones Senior Mens' Society, and Lion's Paw.  The Lion's Paw was the elite group on campus, of campus leaders, because I was very active in, campus politics.
Speaker 1: And so was there any resistance to you as a black person doing this?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, none whatsoever.  I mentioned that Jesse Arnelle had been president of the university before.  The year before me, a fellow by the name of Bill Johnson had became a physician, was, ran for president, didn't make it, but he was also in Lion's Paw.  Penn State was the kind of place where you pretty much made, what you will.  In other words, if you wanted to feel left out, you could feel left out.  It--and we were, we being black people, were cohesive.  By the time I was in senior year though, I was very much a part of the mainstream of that campus.
Speaker 1: And what are you learning about leadership at that point too, that you think, you know, has stayed with you the rest of your life?
Speaker 2: That--I, I'll tell you what I learned.  When I was junior, pardon, when I was sophomore, the junior class ahead of me, the ones who were going for the senior offices, which is, you know, when, for when you're a senior.  And by definition, you can have a winner and a loser, for university president or president of the senior class and so forth.  And I thought that when you, when, that happened, I said, I wonder what happens to the people who lose?  And then I, then I was reading a campus newspaper and saw that the people who lose are then given the appointed positions of power because they, have already qualified as leaders, you see, which, of course, was my experience, because I ran for the presidency of the interfraternity council.  Now, keep in mind, you're talking about resistance as a black, Penn State had fifty-five fraternities.  There were three black fraternities on campus.  So there were three votes.  And I ran, and in the, in the '50s [1950s] particularly, the fraternities were thought of as being the most conservative group of people that you could have.  And I was the, serious candidate to be president of the interfraternity council at Penn State in 1957.  I, was supposed to win, I didn't, but I, got, I think eighteen votes.  I was the runner-up.  The other fellow got twenty-five and somebody else like eight or nine, something like that.
Speaker 1: But what you're saying is you learned an important lesson that you--it's not so much winning or losing, but it's that you're competing, you know, and you're there, because--.
Speaker 2: No, not that it's--it is winning and losing, it's very important.  But that, what I learned, and I actually became a Lion's Paw member, when the--made up of the people who won those offices, and the people who ran for them.  Follow me?  And so, and that we would then decide who got other appointed positions.
Speaker 1: Now, Lion's Paw, what was--what did it do though?
Speaker 2: It ran every organization on campus and met with the president of the university.  It was--we had our own room in the administrative offices of the campus, where we would meet on ten o'clock on Friday, on--pardon me, on Sunday nights and go until three and four o'clock in the morning dealing with university-related problems and student life.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the issues that you as students were concerned about?
Speaker 2: Oh, all kinds of issues.  I, you know, that was a long time ago, and, but we were very much involved in things, and it was a good group of people.  And I'm still close to them.
Speaker 1: Now, what year did you meet your wife, Judith [Marylyn Davenport]?
Speaker 2: In 1957, when she was a freshman in college and I was a senior.
Story_ID: 6233
Speaker 1: And I also want to know, was it during your Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] times that you were a visiting fellow or is that afterwards, to [University of] Cambridge [Cambridge, England], was that--?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's, that's much, much later.
Speaker 1: Much later, okay.
Speaker 2: Much, much later.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: The, I think just so we have the academic side together, I, was a faculty assistant at Penn State in the economics department as a senior.  I taught the, lab course.  See, they--because the class--the school was getting larger, they had the fundamental economics course was taught by lecture and, with TV screens in various rooms.  And then on Saturdays we would have the, what was called lab and showing kids how to do economic problems, the math, part.  And I was a faculty assistant in doing that.  So I taught the lab part of classes.
Speaker 1: So how many faculty assistants were there like you?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, but who was the professor that you were working with then at that--do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember.  I can see his face as clearly--it's not Green, but, no, I don't remember his name.  He was an excellent economics professor, yeah, and--but it was a large lecture group.  And then we'd break it down to classes of ten to twelve for us to, teach the kids how to do problems.
Speaker 1: And what, you know, because you said it was, unlike today, more theory based, so what theorists, economic theorists were you most, closely aligned to or found their--?
Speaker 2: Me?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm, I--well, I--none in particular.  I mean I read them all, and it was more--and when I say, it's, now, economics as I'm told, and as I peruse the information, it's more math driven, econometric based.  Then it was more, talking about the theories of [Thomas] Malthus or [John Maynard] Keynes.  Keynes, of course, I mean everybody wanted to become a Keynesian, and I guess I was one like everyone else.
Story_ID: 6234
Speaker 1: And in this whole process, I'm wondering, are there other things influencing you as a person, and, you know, because often I think of college as, you know, a place, sort of acculturation period and I'm just wondering what else you were taking, you know, in. You're clearly, you know, showing leadership--.
Speaker 2: Well, I can't say, you know, it's sort of hard to explain.  It's--I think that, that I enjoyed a rather unique experience at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] in terms of my being active in campus politics and, achieving a certain degree of social and political acceptability.  I was active with the thespians, which is the theater group.  And, again, it's part of my eclectic life.  I, played bridge with the independents, the independent men, who were mostly veterans.  The theater group was different, but I ran for interfraternity council president.  So I, crossed, I spanned a great many different environments.  And I've, I learned that I could do that, you follow me?  But I never doubted that I could do that.  It was, it was what one did.
Speaker 1: You know what I find so, in many ways, the Penn State that you describe is one that was, given the times, allowed for an African American to, have some potential realized.  Maybe that's what I'm trying to say.
Speaker 2: I don't think it's any different now.  I think people think it's different because I think the expectations are different.  I think that Penn State is like life.  It's what you, it's what you make.  I, don't think people tried to help--pardon me, I shouldn't say it, that's not what I mean.  I think that what you'll find is that there are people who will say that you can't do things, you know, because you're black, and they will be black and white.  And at Penn State, it was, there was a fundamental indifference to, that.  It's who you, it's what you bring to the table.  And if, you brought a certain, the requisite skills, social and political, then you were treated as someone with requisite skills, period.  And it's not a question of people reaching out to you, but they certainly would not try to say that you can't do it because you're, black, you know.
Speaker 1: And what--were there other things, any other things that happened during those Penn State years that you think were important, you know, to you in your development?  And I'm wondering also, were you aware of or involved at all with, you know, things like, well, I mean that with, 1954 was the year that 'Brown vs. Board of Education [of Topeka, Kansas,' 1954]--were you aware--?
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very much so, but the thing that we were most aware of was when the Montgomery [Alabama] bus boycotts occurred, because that was in my sophomore year in '56 [1956], and I was very much aware of the kids, of the people walking to school, walking and rather than riding the buses, you know.  And that, that was, had a tremendous emotional impact on me and on everyone else there, I think.  But it, you know, Penn State was not--colleges were not civil rights-oriented at that time.  But we were very, very much aware of it, but it wasn't an insular environment for the most part, and concentrating on those things which were occurring there.
Story_ID: 6235
Speaker 1: And your wife [Judith Marylyn Davenport], she was--so, she's a freshman, you're a--?
Speaker 2: Senior.
Speaker 1: Senior.  And, and you're graduating.  She was in another school in the area, right?
Speaker 2: Sure, yes, that's right.  She really had started off as a pre-med major really.
Speaker 1: Now, what are you thinking you want to do at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, up until that time, no, before I met my wife, in 1957, and I'd been told from high school by the friends of the girls that I was dating, that, "You should be lawyer," you know.  I never wanted to particularly be a lawyer, you know.  I wanted to be a businessperson.  And, but so I was in the college of business administration, and I achieved a certain level of success at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania].  And, in the spring of '57 [1957], I started taking job interviews to talk about the possibility of placement in the spring or fall.  And I, applying for, management trainee programs, as they were called then.  And then I was--I took eleven job interviews without even a follow up.  And I said, I said--by the twelfth one, I asked, "Do you hire Negroes for your management trainee program?"  And they say, "No."  Okay, and one company, an oil company, said that they had a fellow who was in PR [public relations], but basically, nobody in the management.  And so that's when I decided that I had to go to law school, that I needed to be independent.  And so--.
Story_ID: 6236
Speaker 1: Now, how is your decision made about what law school you're gonna, you know, look at or attend or I mean what are you--?
Speaker 2: Although I had been socially very successful, my grades were really mostly indifferent because I wasn't concerned about grades.  I wasn't planning on going to, the grad school.  The people who were planning to go to grad school or med school, they worked hard to get good grades.  The rest of us, we just did, you know, did just as much as we could to, get by, but we were not terribly concerned about distinguishing ourselves academically, if we were not planning on grad school.  And I was not.  So the question was where could, where would I be admitted?  And I was admitted at Temple [University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and Dickinson law school [Pennsylvania State University, The Dickinson School of Law, University Park, Pennsylvania].  Those were the only two I really applied to, Temple and Dickinson because, you know, I felt I could afford it, and, my grades would get me in, which they did.
Speaker 1: And you got in, and what is Temple's, do you--you know, what is its reputation and what is its sort of focus within, because you know, in Philadelphia, I don't know how, but you have the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you have--.
Speaker 2: Villanova [University, Villanova, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Villanova, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, remember, this is 1958 by this time.  And I'm just happy into law school, period.  It wasn't a question of focus.  I didn't know what I would do with the law, except that I thought that it would make me independent.  And so, that's what I did.  So, and I went, I went to Temple.  I got admitted to Temple and Dickinson, and that's where I went.
Speaker 1: And now this, you know, law school's its own experience.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and I'm wondering, you know, what your perception of it was and what it actually ended up being, and yet, you did very well there too.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 6237
Speaker 1: And so, I'd like you just to talk about, you know, the courses, the, you know, the way of sort of thinking, the setting and, you know--?
Speaker 2: Well, let me go back a bit and say that, and I've always, I tell kids, if you don't have a daddy or mommy to explain things to you, everything you want to know is in a book.  I've always been a reader.  I've read a lot of books, even during college [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] and during the summers and when, between each year, junior year, senior year, freshman and sophomore and so forth and so on.  And, you know, I read a book called 'The Philadelphian,' 'The Young Philadelphian' [sic, 'The Young Philadelphians'] was in the late '50s [1950s] or thereabouts, '56 [1956], '57 [1957], which became a film, but invariably talked about this guy who went to the University of Pennsylvania Law School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And he worked very hard and had gotten very good grades.  And he, and it led to a certain kind of career.  And so therefore, even though I was unfocused in the sense of knowing what law school was all about, I knew that I had to work hard.  And I knew that you had to form groups to, to study.  I had a, one of my former classmates, I mean, he was a year ahead of me at Penn State, who was a student at Temple [University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at the time, and he, he told me, he said, "Ron, law school is not only about brains, but, you know, it's about your but time--how much time you put in."  And, you know, so I knew that--I mean I didn't know what law school was all about or what it would require, but I wanted to put my best foot forward.  And so I buckled down and began to work.  I worked harder in my first semester in law school than I'd ever worked in my life, you know, which meant that I really tried to prepare for classes and, for the exams.  And then the grades came out, and then I got really serious.  But by that, I mean, if you basically, like most of us, did not do a whole lot of work in college, who were not going to grad school, when you come out and you go to a graduate school, and you work then eight or ten hours a day--eight hours a days, you think you're working hard.  But after the first semester, I--it was the twelve, fourteen, fifteen hours a day, six days, six and a half days a week, okay.  It was a whole different ballgame, whole different level of concentration and work.
Speaker 1: Now, you were taking, what were your first-year classes, were they constitutional and civil--?
Speaker 2: Property, it's property towards contracts, were the fundamental courses in your first year, yeah.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: And criminal law.
Speaker 1: And criminal law, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did, and civil procedure, you don't--?
Speaker 2: Civil procedure too, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And did you find that there was any course that you took, you know, really took a liking to?  I think property, you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I did all right in the courses.  No, I--and remember, this is all new.  I was just trying to be the best student, you see.  I had no plans at that time of trying to become a law professor.  I was just trying to be a, the best student.  And I studied my butt off for all of them.  Yeah, I did better at some than I did in others, but, I worked hard.
Story_ID: 6238
Speaker 1: Now, because I had, you know, the reason I'm asking these questions is that legal training teaches you how to think in many ways.  It's sort of different from the training you had been getting, you know?
Speaker 2: Now, economics and philosophy, remember, law is also the correlation of seemingly unrelated events.  That's what I said economics was.  And philosophy, we had to take philosophy courses.  I had--I was telling a friend of mine that I took the basic courses in philosophy and I have a logical mind.  So I was lazy.  I'd never mastered how, all the various, logical proofs that you have.  So I'd get B in the course where other people who could not think at all would get an A because they just followed the Venn diagrams or what have you, the various proofs.  So I, already--I had a very much, a logical mind from day one.
Speaker 1: And so you, now, I had read some place, well, first of all, you became editor for the 'Law Quarterly'.
Speaker 2: I was an editor.
Speaker 1: You were an editor, okay.  And then you did very well in your constitutional law class?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.  I--when I graduated, but, frankly, I didn't notice until, until graduation night, I won the constitutional law prize and the prize in real property.  So, but I was surprised.  I frankly didn't know until I read it in the program.
Speaker 1: But you had a sense that you had become serious in many ways.  I mean the difference between Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], where you're social and you're active, and you're, you know, getting all your leadership and--?
Speaker 2: I became educationally--really focused, in terms of trying to, to excel--.
Speaker 1: And are you--.
Speaker 2: --in law school.
Story_ID: 6239
Speaker 1: Are you also, at this point, trying to figure out what you want to do next?
Speaker 2: No.  No, no, no.  No, I was just simply, just being the best student.  And I'd figured I'd be a lawyer, and that I'd make a living.  I'd work in a law firm and that kind of thing.  I clerked in the office with Chris Edley who was head of the United Negro College Fund, who just died a couple of months ago.  And I also clerked for the law firm of Norris, Green, Harrison and Higginbotham.  And so I, you know, I had a very clear feel and a sense of what I could do as a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay, and during those times of clerking, did you learn anything particularly from Chris Edley, you know, that stuck with you, and then I'd also like to talk about the, you know, the Norris, Green--.
Speaker 2: Harris and Higginbotham.
Speaker 1: Harris and Higginbotham firm.
Speaker 2: No, I just learned that these were men of great talent.  I mean Chris Edley had gone to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Chris Edley was very focused in college and a very smart man, very smart, and went to Harvard Law School.  And he--I, spent a lot of time with him and helped him try a case that was a very important case.  And he just--and I tried out a lot of ideas on him.  He had very strong ideas, and we, got along very well.
Story_ID: 6240
Speaker 1: Okay, so I said, you know, I was first talking about Christopher Edley, and I'd like you, at least, you know, I mean obviously, you know, he probably didn't have a lot of black, young black clerks that, you know, presented--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) One.
Speaker 1: To him for clerkship.
Speaker 2: (laughs) One.  Well, see, the firm was more Lightfoot and Edley.  Lewis Tanner Moore, Chris Edley, and Jim Lightfoot, who became my preceptor was also a Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate.  So it was more Lightfoot and Edley.
Speaker 1: And what, what--can you can describe what Christopher Edley was like, sort of as a person?
Speaker 2: Hardworking, hard driving, smart, thorough, just a good person to work with.
Speaker 1: And that was--you interned there--what--during--after what year?
Speaker 2: In 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was--you graduate in '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: That's right, between my second and third year.
Speaker 1: Okay, then when did you intern or--you were an associate, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with the--.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was after graduation.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--are you thinking like, with Morris Lightfoot and--Morris--?
Speaker 2: No, Moore--.
Speaker 1: Moore.
Speaker 2: Lightfoot and Edley.
Speaker 1: Edley, okay.  What types of things were they, you know, what kind of cases or things were you working on?
Speaker 2: Typical stuff, you know, not malpractice--tort cases, criminal law, real estate, you know, very ordinary stuff.
Story_ID: 6241
Speaker 1: But I want you to help me, give me (laughs), instead of me having to pull it out.  I'm just trying, I mean, just so people understand the tenor of the day.  First of all, these are very well-educated people.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Very much so--smart.
Speaker 1: Their classmates have gone on, you know, and our, in our law firms, you know, or whatever, on the bench.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what I'm--I'm just trying to give a context for things.  Okay, that's all, but you have to help me.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll try.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, the context, you know, they are very, these were very ordinary cases with ordinary people, for the most part.  We, you know, when we had, when there was a good case, we'd only see the case after the client had lost their money, had gone to some other lawyers.  There was a resistance of going to, to black lawyers, as such.  They would go to a white lawyer first and then, then get, get to us.  But all--well, so the Moore, Lightfoot and Edley, it was just your really, like what would now be called the, the legal services type of practice, you know.  And that, I mean that's, that's what it was.  It was poverty law before it was called poverty law.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what are you learning about, you know, lawyering at that time because you only think of lawyers in today's term, but, you know, it was a hard way in some respects still to make a living.
Speaker 2: Oh, I never thought of it that way.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I never thought of, you know, for me it was more an opportunity because I could rely on myself, and whatever skills or talents that I had.  No, but in other words, what I'm driving at here is that--I, I'd read a lot of books, and I, I thought I had a pretty fair idea of what it required to succeed in life, you know, both in terms of your presentation of yourself and your ideas, your record, your track record, and the skills that you needed.  And I thought that I had them.  I thought that, with the exception of the fact that I was--excuse me--that I was black, that all of the requisite skills that one needed to be successful and a leader in life, that, that I had those skills.  And I'd had enough success in both, in high school and in college, that, that I was very comfortable with who I was.  And, and remember, for myself, when I finished Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania], I was thinking that when I graduated, I was at the top of the heap.  I was the campus leader.  My wife [Judith Marylyn Davenport] and I, we then were moving socially in the mainstream, so we would, we would go--you know, we'd have good times with--I belonged to a black fraternity.  We had great times at our little shabby fraternity house, but we had fun times there.  But I was also going to the rich, white fraternities as a guest, you see.  My wife and I, we were guests.  So we were moving in the mainstream of, of campus life.  And what I thought, and these were the words that occurred to me, when I graduated, I said, "Now I have to start all over again, and the pond is so much bigger."
Speaker 1: And so--but you still had that same determination to do it--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) The same drive.
Speaker 1: That same drive.
Story_ID: 6242
Speaker 1: So now, when you--you got married the year you graduated from law school [Temple University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.  Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, and now, is your wife [Judith Marylyn Davenport], is she, you know--well, at that point, she's just, she's almost four years--okay.  So she had finished--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) She had work for us.  She finished college in 1961.  We got engaged in 19--in October of 1961.  I graduated in June of 1962.  We were married on August the 4th, 1962.
Speaker 1: You know, and I just want to ask you.  I don't ask this that often, but you've been married a long time, and it appears that you've had a true partnership.  And I'm just wondering what about her did you, you know, were you attracted to?
Speaker 2: Well, to start off, I was attracted to her because she was attractive, and secondly, that she was smart.  And I knew that I would be operating in different environments at--whether--whatever I did in terms of my career.  And, you know, she was an eighteen-year old freshman who could move with these very sophisticated senior men and women, because most of the women were older, much older--had been in college for three years.  And she could move with comfort, you know, and in a black environment and in a white environment, because, you know, half our time was spent with, in, in the social milieu of Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] in terms of a white environment.  But we could still go out and dance and dance back at our, my black fraternity house.  So we, we--even as a freshman, she was--she had the skill and the talent to move in different environments, and amongst, you know, very ambitious people.  My, my colleagues--my, and the student-government type colleagues, you know, who were ninety-nine percent white, who were very smart and very ambitious.
Speaker 1: Now--now who were some of your--would people recognize some of, you know, who the classmates were at that time?
Speaker 2: Not from--not Penn State.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Not from Penn State.
Speaker 2: Or, except that, and some of them have done very well, but they've not become national figures.
Speaker 1: And the other thing, what black fraternity, what fraternity?
Speaker 2: Omega Psi Phi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 6243
Speaker 1: So you graduate.  You--what is your employment possibilities, and who are you looking to?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well, when I was graduating, first of all, I had a mentor by the name of Cornelius Finbar Murphy--no, Earl Finbar Murphy, I'm sorry.  And he looked at me, and he said, you know, you come from very ordinary circumstances.  You've done very, very well here, and you're comfortable with who you are.  And I'd like to send you to, so you'd get the kind of exposure that I think a person like you should have.  And he recommended me for a fellowship to Yale [University Law School, New Haven, Connecticut].  And that was when I was a senior.  And so, but I have applied for job--I have a job offer from the [U.S.] Justice Department's Antitrust Division in the honors program.  And I had this fellowship.  I, I was accepted to, to Yale Law School, when I got the fellowship.  And so my, my wife, rather than look for a job we just got married in August, and I worked for, part-time for the Norris, Green, Harris and Higginbotham law firm.  And then in September, we, we jumped in the car and drove on up to Penn State--I mean to Yale.
Speaker 1: And that's when, and that's where you got your LLM?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, and he was trying really to say that, I'm gonna give you one more sort of topping off, and this is an opportunity.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He felt I had the intellectual capabilities of doing it.  He looked at the, the environment from which I, I came from with a non-privileged environment and said, you know, that, that a Yale imprimatur would be very important for me.  And he was right.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Now, what was your experience there?  How did you enjoy that year there, and I was also curious about the subject of your, you know, the paper you produced too, and why you chose that?
Speaker 2: I love Yale.  To me, Yale was an intellectual homecoming.  I mean I was a very good student at Temple [University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I worked hard.  But it was not as intellectually challenging.  Yale was really challenging.  And people were very smart, and so you really had to be on your Ps and Qs.  And they, they read a lot.  They, they were intellectual.  They were intellectuals who had worked hard and who, and who had mastered a lot of information.  And so that you could not get by with fuzzy thinking or with glibness.  So I loved, I loved it.  It was again, an intellectual homecoming.  And it was a great, great experience for me.
Story_ID: 6244
Speaker 1: So what are you studying during that year?  And--.
Speaker 2: I was taking a lot of different courses, but I took an international law course.  The international law course and, was taught by my, Harold McDougal--Myres McDougal and Harold Laswell, who were, who were like brilliant international law professors.  And it was just fascinating to sit in the class with these very, very smart people.  And it's, for me, I thought that I got to Yale [University Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] at the right time in terms of my academic self confidence.  I knew I could compete.  And so I would, I was not in awe of being there.  I just loved it.  But the people were very smart.  They were very smart, indeed.  And so that you, you start off, you, you have some concern and trepidation about giving your opinion because you figure, if you'd thought of it, and everybody else also must have thought of it, and they must have rejected it.  And then you find out that maybe they hadn't thought of it (laughs), which is a very self-satisfying experience.  It's, it's a confirming experience in terms of your intellectual competitiveness.
Speaker 1: And why did you choose the subject that you chose?  And, you know, you--let's see, what was the--you did it on the--?
Speaker 2: An inquiry into the legality of the U.N. [United Nations] military activities in the Congo.  Yeah, that was my paper.  I, I really can't answer that question.  It just, it was in--I read the newspapers every day, of course, the 'New York Times' [newspaper] and then that was a very hot issue at the time.  And the other courses, you know, the other stuff just didn't interest me.  The international law stuff did.  And so there was an issue about the U.N.'s military activities in, in the Congo.  So I was taking an international law course, and so I decided to--I had to write a paper.  And it was a very, (laughs), that was a tough time writing that paper, but it turned it out to be, you know, a prize paper.  And so, and so I was very pleased with that.
Speaker 1: And at that time, how many students were in the LLM program?
Speaker 2: About twenty, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mostly, I think only five or six of us were Americans, mostly foreigners.
Speaker 1: That is the case with a lot of the LLM's.  I don't think people realize that.  Okay, but most people go get their LLM to--are they looking to teach?
Speaker 2: Mostly, they are.  The people who come from American law schools are looking to--that's a, a law of teaching credential.  I wasn't thinking about law teaching at that time, at least not initially.
Speaker 1: But what were you thinking, just that this was an opportunity, and--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that had presented.  And it wasn't going to hurt.  It was gonna, you know--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) It would help.
Speaker 1: And it opened up a whole new world.
Speaker 2: A world that I, you know, I didn't know what it would open up for me.  I just thought it would be a step in the right direction.
Story_ID: 6245
Speaker 1: Now, do you have children at this point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, no, okay, you're still both single and--
Speaker 2: No, no, married.  I'm married.
Speaker 1: Married, I'm sorry.  Married.  I met newly, I meant newly married [to Judith Marylyn Davenport].  Okay, newly married, okay.  Now, when you--that's right, 'cause your first year--when you--I want to go back a little bit, just in terms of Norris--no, Green, Green--.
Speaker 2: Norris, Green, Harris and Higginbotham.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Norris, Green, Harris and Higginbotham, okay.  And I want to ask just about that whole firm, and, you know, its position.  You know, you were saying earlier that it was the top--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Premier black law firm in America.  We had Father Divine [religious leader] as our client.  We, you know, which is a major client, huge.  And we had the Methodist Church, which I think that was, as a client.  Austin Norris is originally from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  He's Lincoln [University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], Class of '12 [1912] and Yale [University] Law School [New Haven, Connecticut], Class of '17 [1917], who got into a scuffle when he was drafted into the first World War and refused to be a porter.  And they threw him in the brig.  And there were a bunch of Yale officers on, on the base, and they signed a petition to, to get him out, and he wound up being an officer and a national figure.  Austin Norris was at--and who also had a stammer-- it's amazing.  But Austin was just a brilliant man, talented.  He built, you know, this spectacular law firm.  And he, he understood people and power.  And he knew, knew how to get things done, you know.  He was unassuming, most people had never heard of Austin Norris.  But, you know, he was responsible for Leon Higginbotham being on the bench and Clifford Scott Green, who was a senior judge in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] being on the bench, and for Bill Brown, who became [U.S. President Richard] Nixon's chairman, EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] being there.  Austin was very quiet and very effective and very powerful.
Speaker 1: And were you working pretty much--during that time, you worked there just for three months, the summer?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: And so were you, did you have--who within the firm did you have most contact with?
Speaker 2: With everyone really.  I worked with them all.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: But I guess--Austin took a liking to me, for whatever reason.  Leon Higginbotham, I helped him prepare his first application for the federal bench when he was thirty-two years of age.  I worked on that with him.  It was a fascinating--and Clifford Scott Green is really, as I said, he's a senior judge, a senior fellow judge in Philadelphia, very talented man, very talented.  It was a talented law firm.  The Harrises, Doris Harris, who wound up on the, as a federal judge--not federal judge, as a judge--and just some very talented people, and very smart.  And we had a good client base.
Story_ID: 6246
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause you don't even think of, you know, Father Divine [religious leader]--.
Speaker 2: That's a major client.
Speaker 1: It's a major client.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and in the church.
Speaker 1: Right, in the church, but can you tell, just for people who may not know who Father Divine is?
Speaker 2: Oh, Father Divine was, I'm trying to think of someone he'd be like.  He'd be like Bishop T.D. Jakes now, only bigger 'cause he didn't have a TV, but he had the following all over the country and all over the world really, and very popular, and he was very smart.  He, he built churches.  He would feed people for fifteen cents.  You'd come and get a full meal.  He had, he had hotels and the Divine Hotels where you would stay and, for, you know, a dollar a night or something ridiculous like that.  He was an incredibly smart man, Father Divine, and very, very influential.
Speaker 1: Now, he based out of where at that point, was it New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: No, he, he had a place in the suburbs of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 6247
Speaker 1: You know, I have--I would like to have one sort of reflective, you know, and you may not have perspective on this, but Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] has, you know, sort of, it spawned of Boulee [club] and Jack and Jill [of America Foundation, Inc.], and the Links [Inc.], and I don't know what else (laughs).
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But why was that such, you know, and maybe there have been studies on this, but--.
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I just--and Philadelphia is a very social place.  It just is, I don't know why, but, but it is.
Speaker 1: And, okay, so anyway, you're--what did--the firm though, Norris, Green, Harris and Higginbotham, how long was its, you know, its--.
Speaker 2: Heyday?
Speaker 1: Heyday period.
Speaker 2: Probably for about ten years, you know.  And then Leon [Higgenbotham] left to become a federal trade commissioner, but things kept going.  And then he came back, and then he became a federal district judge in Philadelphia.  Bill Brown left to become Chairman of EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission], for [U.S. President Richard] Nixon.  [Austin] Norris was what I call a Dem-Rep.  He was a Republican until the [U.S. President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt administration.  Then he became a Democrat, and he was a Democratic leader.  And he was just a very influential guy.  In fact, it's when Jack [U.S. President John F.] Kennedy was elected President, he had a conference of like, with the top one hundred or two hundred black men in America--leaders, and Austin Norris was one of them.  And the interesting thing when he came back, we sat him down in the office, and he said, "You know, I met this, the President, and he's an interesting guy, but I really like this [U.S. President] Lyndon Johnson fellow."  He said, "He, he's gonna be all right for us."  Austin was a good judge of character.
Speaker 1: That's pretty prophetic, cause most people did not, you know, they really didn't even--.
Speaker 2: That's right--didn't like him because of the Southern accent.  So he said, but I--he said, "I really like this Lyndon Johnson fellow."
Story_ID: 6248
Speaker 1: Now, were there--at that time in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], what other things are sort of happening, and how is the black community forming, you know, and--.
Speaker 2: By the early '60s [1960s] you're talking about?
Speaker 1: The early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Well, by that time, you know, the Freedom Rides have hit and the Civil Rights Movement had hit.  And there was--the president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] is a fellow by the name of Cecil Moore who was not a Philadelphian.  He was from West Virginia, but he had taken over the NAACP, and he thought the blacks Philadelphia were too conservative, and he was pushing them, and they were--it was too clubby.  And he was trying to get the, get street people and ordinary people involved.  Now, by that time, I'm on my way out, so I'm, you know, I was not involved in that.  I, you know, I did walk on the--in demonstrations with them, but I was not very much involved.
Story_ID: 6249
Speaker 1: So you leave Yale [University Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], do you come--do you go immediately to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I went immediately to Pittsburgh to teach.
Speaker 1: So how did that offer come about?  I mean how did the opportunity at Duquesne University [School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] come about.?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said earlier, the LLM is normally a teaching credential.  By that time, I'd, I--since I was with the preeminent--had clerked with the preeminent law firm, black firm, in America [Norris, Green, Harris, and Higginbotham] we took a look at, I took a look at some of the white law firms, but I really wasn't interesting in doing that because I realized that, that there--in, in graduate school, I'm at the Association of American Law Schools meeting, which we called our slave market for everybody--not just blacks, but everybody.  That you had people who had been to--who were graduates of the preeminent law schools, who had been at major law firms, and they were all trying to get jobs on law faculties, 'cause there were only 3,000 law professors in the country.  There are 120 law schools or something like that.  So there're roughly 3,000 law professors in the country, so that it was a highly desired and desirable job and in it.  And so I concluded that, that if I could get a job law teaching, that I'd make as much money, or more, than I could practicing law as a black lawyer, and that I'd have a great deal more flexibility.  And you know, I'd have a lot more prestige, frankly.
Speaker 1: And so you applied through this--through the Association?
Speaker 2: No, what happened--well, you, you show up in the market, and you--they put your name down, and you go around and you have interviews with various law schools from all over the country.  And it's like you show your teeth or something.  And--but Duquesne wasn't there.  The, the dean of the Duquesne law school was Thomas Francis Quinn, an Irishman.  And he came up to Yale and he interviewed me and some other people.  And he went back, and he recommended somebody else for--to, to the faculty, and that person wasn't interested in teaching at Duquesne.  He then recommended me.
Story_ID: 6250
Speaker 1: And so this is sort of exciting in many ways?  You're going--isn't it exciting?  I mean you're going off to Pitts--no?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I could not stand Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  I, you know, and a very good friend of mine had just taken a job working for a law firm in Pittsburgh, and I, I just--and he called me.  And I was in the library, and I called him back when I got, when I got home that night.  And this is at Yale [University Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], and I just started to talk about Pittsburgh, and how much I hated the place and so forth (laughs).  And I tried to be nice, but, you know, the bile just kept bubbling out.  I was anxious to get a job teaching or keeping my--I had opportunities at that time, at the University of South Dakota [Vermillion, South Dakota], at Akron law school [University of Akron School of Law, Akron, Ohio] at the time, and University of Nsukka in Nigeria and the [U.S.] Justice Department and the, and the [U.S.] State Department.  So it wasn't a question of, of excitement.  It's more a question of what makes the most sense, you follow me?  And Duquense [University Law School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] made a--you know, I went there and they were, you know, I met with the faculty.  And they made me the offer, and, and I said, it made the most sense.  And so, therefore, I accepted.  My friend who was joining, who was white and a good friend, who was joining a major law firm in Pittsburgh, he heard I was going to Pittsburgh.  And he called me up.  He said, "I can't believe you're coming to live in Pittsburgh" (laughs).  But I love it now.
Speaker 1: And what made--what didn't you like about, cause Pittsburgh is different from--.
Speaker 2: Well, I was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], you follow me?  And I just never had a good time there.  Yes, that's--I'd only been there twice or three--and, you know, I went there to visit my wife, went there to see Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] play Duquense in basketball, but I just never liked it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this--what--what instruction, like a first-year law professor.  You come on as an associate professor?
Speaker 2: No, assistant.
Speaker 1: Assistant professor, okay, and what--how are you trained, you know, what training is provided?
Speaker 2: There is no training, you just hit the ground.  You know, you--they, they give you your courses.  I started on July the 1st, 1963.  Then I had the summer to prepare my courses.  I was scheduled to teach originally criminal law, but I was switched to constitutional law and personal property and something.  I forget--wills, I think, yeah, wills.  And, you know, so I spent the summer getting prepared for classes, and then we--then you're there.
Speaker 1: And so you're there, you're in front of your first class, and how does that go?  How is that experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I'm a natural ham anyway, so it's no problem for me.  You, it's, I had really no difficulty teaching, you know.  And I was--had a very good friend who was also a first-year professor, and I could establish immediate rapport with the students.  I took as a model, though, Guido Calibresi so was a--then just a Yale professor, whom I'd never had in class.  But he, he would walk into a classroom and take off his jacket.  And then it was just him and the students and, and ideas.  And I loved that, you know.  And so I'd walk in and I'd, you know, I took off my jacket.  I was informal.  I'd sit on the desk, and I'd--we would just go at it.
Story_ID: 6251
Speaker 1: And you had, now was it later that you picked up teaching in the federal courts, federal system?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you, so how large is the law school [Duquense University Law School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] faculty at this point?
Speaker 2: And--.
Speaker 1: About twelve or thirteen, maybe four--yeah, about twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 2: And is this a newer law school that--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) It's new in the sense that--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Than, you know, let's say a Temple [University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or?
Speaker 1: It, it had, it was a night school until 1960.  It was founded in the '20s [sic, 1911].  It was a night school through 1960, had its first day class in 1960.
Speaker 2: And so you're--you're teaching, you're getting, you know, acclimated to life in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Correct.
Speaker 2: You are, well, you are--what else is going on at this--?
Speaker 1: Well, the getting acclimated to life in Pittsburgh.  There's, and I am, was elected to the board of the [National] Urban League to take the president of--particular place of the president of Duquesne who was on the board of the Urban League.  And I'm active in, in what's the nascence of the Civil Rights Movement in Pittsburgh.  There are things happening in civil rights.  And I'm just still feeling my way because I'm the new kid in town.  But, you know, one of the things I remember is that my coming to Pittsburgh was a newsworthy event.  "Negro Appointed to Law Faculty," and I was in the newspapers, you see, because that was a newsworthy occasion, you know.
Speaker 2: And the 'Pittsburgh Courier' [newspaper] was one of our primary--but it was in all the papers--or you say, it was in all the papers.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Yeah. All the papers.
Speaker 2: Besides the, you know, the 'Pittsburgh Courier.'  Now, so you get involved.  So the head, so you're saying the head of Duquesne University was--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) They asked me to take--no, not--they asked me to take his place on the Urban League board.
Speaker 2: Okay, and that gets you integrated into the, into Pittsburgh community more than you would have otherwise been possibly?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) That's correct.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, and so what are you learning about this community at this time, and what--?
Speaker 1: Again, just feeling my way, looking at the problems that black folks were having and, and just meeting various leaders.  And we were invited out a lot because, you know, and my coming was newsworthy.  And so we had prominence from day one.
Story_ID: 6252
Speaker 1: So I want you to just describe, you know, the--because you're trying to feel your way in this community, whether--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And whether you're, you know, and so, what is that community like and what are you--you know, because this is a community you came to be very integrated in?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a, very open community.  It was very open to people, very open to outsiders, okay, or at least open to me even though I was an outsider.  And, you know, I could, you know, it was--I said, I said earlier that Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] is very social and pretty much closed to outsiders if you don't, if you're not sort of blessed.  But Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] is not that way at all.  It was very open and, you know, and I had ideas about, about things, and people would listen and they would evaluate what I had to say.
Story_ID: 6253
Speaker 1: And so what are the issues at the [National] Urban League, the Urban League, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Urban League is dealing with, and what, because the Urban League has changed a lot during that time?
Speaker 2: There's education, it was, you know, job placements.  It was healthcare issues.  Those are the, main things, education and, jobs.
Speaker 1: And so, you are--I want to also understand something though, at UI--I mean at OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Center], when did you get involved with OIC ?  Was that during, was that later?
Speaker 2: I was never really involved with OIC.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Sorry.
Speaker 2: I never really, I never was.
Speaker 1: Wrong factoid [laughing] okay.  Now, so you are, okay, but aren't you--let me just ask this question, were you also on the mayor's Committee on Human Resources, did that happen--?
Speaker 2: I was general counsel--,
Speaker 1: General counsel.
Speaker 2: The poverty program, of the poverty program.
Speaker 1: Okay, is this around this same time?
Speaker 2: A year and a half later.
Speaker 1: Oh, a year and a half, okay.
Speaker 2: Because the poverty program was passed in 1965.
Speaker 1: And so how did that happen that you were picked to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was that myself and a fellow by the name of Matthew Holdren, who was an assistant professor in the political science department at the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  We were successful in organizing the community to take--to make certain that the programs were responsive to the needs of, black people.  And because of the visibility there with the mayor's office, that, at the end thereof, they asked me if I wanted to, and I was, I was a law professor and they asked me if I wanted to serve as counsel because that was a part-time position, it wasn't full.
Story_ID: 6254
Speaker 1: And in that position, because there was a lot of focus on poverty programs at that time, and a great deal of sort of hope--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: With these programs.  And so, what was your role as sort of general counsel there?
Speaker 2: Just to monitor the contracts and make sure we were doing things in the right way.  We, had the best--one of the best poverty programs in the country, in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], good leadership, very, very effective programs.  And poverty programs were effective.  They, were a way of employing people who were underemployed and giving them jobs commensurate with their skills and opening up opportunity for people who were looking for education and training.  They were very successful.  I don't think they, they get the credit that they deserve.
Speaker 1: And do you have any specific examples of things that occurred or, you know, or statistics about things that--?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now, when--.
Speaker 2: Remember, I was only counsel for three years.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I know, but still I'm just saying those programs didn't last all that--I mean their heyday didn't last all that long.
Speaker 2: But they were very effective in many cities, even in the ones that were, heavily political in terms of creating opportunities for black folks.  They were very effective.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have--can you just give context for how that program really developed, and who were sort of the key players then in the development of the poverty program?
Speaker 2: In the country or in Pittsburgh?
Speaker 1: In the country and in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: Well, [U.S. President] Lyndon Johnson was who, was the person, he and, and Sargent Shriver, who was head of, then [U.S.] Office of Economic Opportunity, OEO.  And, and they, were the ones who were trying to lift the level of poverty, not, just for blacks, but for all under privileged and poor people.  And like, you know, they put a lot of money into it in 1965.  And it was, it was very, very effective.  It did a lot of good.
Speaker 1: Now, when--so you, from 1963 to 1965, you're assistant professor.  And then, and then in '65 [1965]--,
Speaker 2: I become associate professor [at Duquesne University School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: You become associate, and how were you an associate professor?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: For two years.
Speaker 2: Right, and then I become a full professor in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay, in '67 [1967].
Story_ID: 6255
Speaker 1: And are you responsibilities changing then in terms of, you know, what you're doing or what courses you teach?
Speaker 2: My courses--I'm teaching courses, and I'm growing, and doing some writing and just was very active in the community. I become president of the [National] Urban League.  I was, in '64 [1964] I spend working for the [NAACP, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Legal Defense Fund, and I'm based in New York.  And that's '64 [1964] during the summer of '64 [1964].  And I headed the Legal Defense Fund's office in Mississippi for two weeks when the kids were missing [civil rights workers James Cheney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner were abducted and murdered].  And I worked on the brief on 'Abernathy v. The State of Alabama,' which was the Freedom Riders case that went to the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  So that was a busy summer.
Speaker 1: Now, can you talk about who you had occasion to get to know there?  Was Marian Wright--?
Speaker 2: No, Marian Wright [Edelman, founder of Children's Defense Fund] and I graduated together from Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut].  And, yeah, so we were very good friends.  And [U.S. Congresswoman] Eleanor Holmes Norton was also a student there at that time.  So, you know, and we're friends, but Marian and I, Marian Wright and I are very good friends.
Speaker 1: Now, but I'm trying to under--so who was involved in, you know, in the NAACP Legal Defense Fund at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, Jack Greenberg was the director counsel, Jim [James] Nabrit was the number two person, Derrick Bell was there, you know, Norman Amaker was there, who taught at Loyola [University] Chicago [Illinois] for a number of years.  I'm trying to remember some of the other names.  Well, it was, it was an outstanding group of lawyers.  And it, and the--oh, the woman who--she was a second-year law student at Harvard [University Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] at that time, who was--Elizabeth Holtzman was also there in that summer of '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: And can you--I, you know, I keep asking you to paint context, but the NAACP is very aggressive but, you know, the Urban League is trying to take care of jobs and sort of as a social, educational--.
Speaker 2: Education, yeah, social welfare.
Speaker 1: Social welfare.  And then the NAACP is, especially the Legal Defense, what is its role?
Speaker 2: Well, it's bringing lawsuits to knock down the walls of segregation, all over the country, and, school desegregation, you know, so they're very aggressive in doing those kind of things.
Speaker 1: And how had you gotten recruited or how had the opportunity come that you worked with them that summer?
Speaker 2: There was a law professor, and the name escapes right now at Columbia University [New York, New York], who recommended me to Jack Greenberg.  And Jack Greenberg offered me the job.
Story_ID: 6256
Speaker 1: So you are in your, you know, you're actually in your early 30s at this point or 30--just about, in your early 30s, and tell me the story about--are there other things between 1963 and 1970 that are sort of important in terms of your development?  And I say 1970 because that's when you became dean [of Duquesne University School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Well, only that I spent the summer of '66 [1966] working in school desegregation for the then, the [U.S.] Health, Education and Welfare Department.  So I'm, I've walked every hill and molehill in Mississippi dealing with, trying to desegregate schools, heading up, heading up a team of blacks and whites, lawyers and educators, dealing with school desegregation.
Speaker 1: And who were the people that you were interacting or working and who were leading those school desegregation efforts?
Speaker 2: These were, I was working with the superintendent of schools in the various Mississippi districts.  It was, a very interesting time, a very tough time.
Speaker 1: And at that time, are there people in the Department of Education that are, you know, helping sort of that process?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, there are lots, but, you know, no one that you would know.  I was fairly well down the pole in terms of, things, but I was, you know, very active.  The, it--I remember I was in Lake County, Tennessee, and the president of the school board said, "Mr. Davenport, if you had been a year earlier, you'd a been killed."  And I said, "I'm glad I wasn't here a year earlier," (laughs) and moved on.
Speaker 1: Did you come across the name of a Rick, Richard Fairley at all?
Speaker 2: Dick--I worked directly with Dick Fairley.  He was the head of that [U.S.] Department [of Education] at that time in 1966.
Speaker 1: Because he has told some stories.  We've interviewed him, and he told, you know, quite a few stories of going in, and, you know, the circumstances.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the head of the department, based in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 6257
Speaker 1: So you are--not only are you dealing with sort of the theoretical issues of training young lawyers, and I want to understand what is the--and at this point Duquesne University [School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] has gone, you know, is not just not just night school, you know, it's a full--,
Speaker 2: It was full time.
Speaker 1: Full-time, full-fledged school.  But how many African Americans are in the school at this point?
Speaker 2: Oh, just a handful, just a handful, very few.
Speaker 1: And you had, resistance at all, no resistance in the rest of the faculty or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, not at all, you're not--okay.
Speaker 2: That's not an issue.
Speaker 1: That's not, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things to keep mind that my, I said, the fellow who hired me was Thomas Francis Quinn, who was an Irishman.  And their, they were accustomed to their struggles with the English.  And the--most of the people on the faculty were first-generation, and they, you know, they're ethnics of varying types.  And they knew discrimination from their own families.  And so, for me, it was just a question of ideas.
Speaker 1: And in many ways, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but Pittsburgh was unique in that way, sort of, in terms of its ethnic makeup, do you think?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, I don't, I can't say.  I can only compare Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and Pittsburgh because those are the cities I spent the most time.  And Pittsburgh is a very ethnic, you know, you have Irish Catholic, Italian Catholic churches and Polish Catholic churches, and Lithuanian Catholic church--it's a whole different ballgame.  And I realized the, competing ideas and experiences in Pittsburgh, but it's a very--and Pittsburgh I say is a very conservative town, but an honest town and, because most of the people there have in, through their own families, experienced discrimination of one sort or the other.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you happen to become Dean of the Law School?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a vacancy (laughs), we'll start with that.  And, I was first put forward to be Dean of Law School in 1968, and my predecessor, Louis L. Mandarino was, he and I, we were both approved by the faculty, with the vote of the faculty.  And there, was a vacancy.  And the president of the university decided to appoint Lou Mandarino, who was a brilliant guy.  He was a Harvard [University] Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] guy and as smart as anybody I've ever met.  But he, after two years, decided to, run for the bench and after a year, he ran for the bench--didn't get elected.  Then he was appointed to the bench, a new court was created in Pennsylvania.  He wound up being on the State Supreme Court in Pennsylvania, which left a vacancy.  And I had been approved in 1968, and so when the vacancy, when Lou left to go to the bench, you know, I was again approved by the faculty, and, appointed by the president.  I was an internal candidate from my colleagues.
Speaker 1: And, you know, being dean comes with a lot of administrative--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Responsibilities, so your colleagues must have felt that you would be fair and you would want--
Speaker 2: Correct. I think the most important thing I can say about that is in terms of, you know, for a black, in, since I was interested in growth, I always thought I could play on a larger stage.  So even though I was very much involved in civil rights activity, you know, in Mississippi and Alabama and other places, I also tried to participate in the mainstream of social activities in the City of Pittsburgh cause I did not want to be restricted to that box called civil rights.  And my colleagues understood that I was, had a broader reach in terms of my friendships than, than just civil rights.  And, and, frankly, the [National] Urban League then, and I was president of the Urban League by that time, was a highly integrated operation with establishment-types, white establishment types who were very actively involved, most of whom were Republican in terms of their politics and moderate, obviously, Republicans.  And so I had a broad range of friendships and, and that--and in--through the poverty program and through the, really through the Urban League, I met the corporate leaders, most of whom were very conservative, but, you know, very talented people, and smart.  And so I had a, really a broad range of, of people whom I knew, and who knew me.
Story_ID: 6258
Speaker 1: And I see, you know, that is not always typical of law school professors, you know, or I mean a lot of times they're, you know, they can be very insular.  So this sort of may have been, you know, a variety of defectors, but I want to understand, because that's--how does the idea of Sheridan Broadcasting [Corporation] fit in here.  I mean this, nothing is media in your background, up to this point.  I mean nothing (laughs).
Speaker 2: Well, it's a question of logic, having been involved in the Civil Rights Movement, having been involved in really in democratic politics and right across the state of Pennsylvania, believing that America is big enough for everybody, but that you have to make America responsive to your interests, I had done enough political organizing throughout the state and in some parts of the country, to realize that, without having a piece of the economic pie, and that you, you're at a substantial disadvantage and so, and so, and I used to tell people that if a bank will loan you ten thousand, they'll loan you a hundred.  If they loan you a hundred thousand, they'll loan you millions, so borrowing millions, you'll be just as bankrupt.  But what I didn't realize that if you borrow fifty thousand dollars from a bank and can't pay them, you've got a problem.  If you borrow a million dollars from the bank, and you can't pay them, you've got a partner, you see.  And, but they said, "Well, you're a law professor, so what do you know about this?" you know.  And I, this is before there were any outreach programs, any set aside programs, any, you know, trying to get business, blacks in business programs, but I knew enough about, about how the game is played.  As I said, it's all a part, going back to my Lion's Paw [campus society, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] experience of being in a room when, when decisions are made.  I know how decisions are made, and I know the criteria that they use for, to make decisions.  And as I said to you earlier, I knew that I had the credentials and the savoir-faire of, for, of someone to, to whom money is loaned.  I said, "If you want to borrow a million dollars, you have to look like someone to whom a million dollars is loaned."  And that's not, just simply in terms of ideas and having a good idea.  It's presentation, it's what you do socially.  It's, how you spend your time, and so I set out to prove--I mean I'd, it was not an accident.  I worked at it for, two years or three years for me to put the whole thing together--and actually for five years.  And to make a long story short, I knew that I could, had the relationships to be able to borrow money.  I knew that I would get one shot.  And I concluded, and since I thought I would retire as a law professor, that I wanted to take a successful business, buy a successful business and make it more successful, rather than buying one candy store and trying to build it into a chain of candy stores.  And so I looked around for those businesses that were successful.  And then I knew that, and that time was 1968, 1969, 1970, in the early '70s [1970s], that it had to be a business that serviced black people because the financial interests would be, would be far more open to, see, to my buying something that serviced black people than in just, in buying a steel mill or an oil company, you follow me?  And so that meant radio and housing, and we wound up buying a radio company and a housing company.  This is about logic.
Story_ID: 6259
Speaker 1: The thing that's missing a little bit, and the only thing I see, but what--because people don't always make the leap from academics to, you know, business, and, or even know how to make the leap.  And even if they are actively involved in the community, you know, or sitting on the, you know, or head of the [National] Urban League, so is this--who is this 'we' that we're talking about that is, you know, this discussion?  Is it you and your wife?  I mean what, who is this 'we' that, we're talking about?
Speaker 2: There were--my wife and myself, but also the black business, black political leaders and social leaders in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], you see, that we've talked about.  I mean I organized them into, an investment-type group, not to put in ten dollars, but talking about, and looking for business opportunities.  We worked at trying to, find these opportunities.  Again, it was not, not an accident.  Now, you say it's unusual, but remember, I come from the '50s [1950s] and we had a business orientation.  My initial goal was to go out and become the successful businessman and to then retire and buy a red MG [automobile] and a baseball cap and teach government at some small college.  I just reversed it.  I did the academic thing first.
Speaker 1: So how, okay, so you're saying even before you became dean of the law school, your mind is sort of thinking along those lines?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and then tell me how, you know, Sheridan Broadcasting [Corporation], how it was sort of formed and hatched and what time period?
Speaker 2: 19--we--I, got--what I did was, I, managed to meet with the head of Mellon Bank, who was John Mayer, good guy.  And I was told, I knew that these radio stations were available.  They wanted 2 million [dollars] for the stations.  I had nothing, you know, I had a good job.  I was dean of the law school, but I had no, money, no real savings to speak of.  And so I said, I asked Johnny Mayer's people, I said, "Could you get somebody to take a look at this and see if it makes any business sense?"  He said fine.  He had it, and he said, yeah, it makes sense.  He said, and we would give you a million, four hundred thousand dollars.  So I'm now eight hundred thousand dollars short.  So I said, where do I get eight hundred thousand dollars?  He said from an insurance company.  So I went to the local representative, and I said, well, who, who?  And he gave me the names of people.  I went to the local representative of Metropolitan Life [Insurance Company] and I said, "I want to borrow eight hundred thousand dollars."  And he said, they came back, and said, "Yes, we'll loan it to you, but you only get thirty percent of the deal."  I said, "That's not acceptable."  I said, "I have to have at least fifty-one percent of the deal" because I wanted to show black folks could run things.  And I wanted to create opportunities for, black people.  And I couldn't do that if I only had thirty percent of the deal, I thought.  So I turned it down.  And I went to Equitable Life Insurance Company because by this time, I'm on the national board of the Urban League and a friend of [Director of the National Urban League] Whitney Young's.  And, then I went to them, and I said, "I want to borrow eight hundred thousand dollars."  And they said--they didn't know what to do because they were investing a hundred million dollars a day in various things.  And they said, "No, we'll loan you three hundred thousand dollars."  So I had, I had a million seven.  So I went back to the bank, I said, a million seven now.  And they said, "Well, go to the, sellers, the Dynamic Broadcasting, you'll give them a million and a half dollars cash on closing day.  You'll take two hundred thousand [dollars] for your operating capital, and they'll take a subordinated note, subordinated to the bank, for five hundred thousand dollars.  And that's how we put the deal together.
Speaker 1: That's pretty impressive.
Story_ID: 6260
Speaker 1: Now, when you did this deal, what other types of media deals with black people were occurring around the country?
Speaker 2: Only one other, that was [founder of Inner City Broadcasting Company] Percy Sutton and the Inner City people in New York and everybody in WLIB [New York, New York radio station] at the time.
Speaker 1: And did their deal consummate before yours or vise--?
Speaker 2: Around the same time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, at the same time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You did this without the help really of sort of a venture capitalist?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And was the minority investment--.
Speaker 1: There was no such thing.
Speaker 2: There was no such thing at that time.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And let me ask you about your due diligence, though, in the industry, because this was, I mean it's not an industry that you really had--,
Speaker 1: I knew nothing about it.
Speaker 2: Particular knowledge about.  So what due diligence did you do in terms of even knowing pricing--,
Speaker 1: None.
Speaker 2: You know, what the going assets were?
Speaker 1: I relied upon the bank to do the financial analysis for me, and that's it.
Speaker 2: (Laughing) I mean it's so--it's not a classic, you know, Harvard Business School [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] case.
Speaker 1: Model, not at all.  It's a whole different ballgame.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, okay.  Now, did you know the market potential?  I mean except your--
Speaker 1: Of course not.  Of course, not.
Speaker 2: (Laughing) Okay, except your speculation that--.
Speaker 1: Not speculation, belief.
Speaker 2: Belief, okay, sorry, belief that the existence exists in the media, and what was the other, media--?
Speaker 1: And housing.  And I was on the board of a rehab company which we wound up buying a year later.
Speaker 2: What was the name of that company?
Speaker 1: Allegheny Housing Rehabilitation Corporation.  It's now run by a very good friend of mine--.
Speaker 2: Washington.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Milton Washington.
Speaker 1: That's how that came about.
Story_ID: 6261
Speaker 1: Tell me how the name came about and--?
Speaker 2: Sheridan [Broadcasting Corporation] was named after the street on which we lived.  We thought about all kinds of combinations and finally I said, you know, we'll just call it Sheridan, that's simple enough.
Speaker 1: And broadcasting immediately, you put that--?
Speaker 2: Well, no, because we, by that time we knew we were going into the radio business.  So it wasn't sort of plucked out of the sky in that sense.
Speaker 1: So talk about your initial, you know, properties.  What came with that--well, it took you--so you formed the company in '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: In '72 [1972], closed in '73 [1973], on February the 28th.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how are you sourcing, I mean these--how did you decide which properties to go after?
Speaker 2: No, what happened was, I relied upon the bank's financial analysis.  I only wanted to buy the Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] stations, but the bank said the--buying the WUFO [radio station] in Buffalo, New York and WILD [radio station] in Boston [Massachusetts] made the most financial sense.
Speaker 1: And they said that because of the market demographics or just the--?
Speaker 2: The numbers.
Speaker 1: The numbers, okay, okay, but talk about just the history of WAMO [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania radio station], do you, you know, the history of the station and when it had gotten started.
Speaker 2: It was, it was started off in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, and it was WHOD.  And it evolved, and it's fifty-five years old.  It's, it was one of the pioneer R&B [rhythm and blues] stations in the country.
Speaker 1: Do you know what WHOD stood for?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but I can tell you want WAMO stands for, and that stands for Allegheny [River] Monongahela [River] and Ohio [River].
Speaker 1: And, but that name change had already happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And who were the, now, who were the previous owners?
Speaker 2: Dynamic Broadcasting was the (unclear).
Speaker 1: And can you talk about who they were, and--.
Speaker 2: They, the leader of them was a guy by the name of Leonard Walk, who was a good guy and smart guy and he was the guy I dealt with.  And there was Bernie Friedman and, and Jim Rich.
Speaker 1: And why were they wanting to sell?
Speaker 2: It was a difficult time, I think, to be, have--to be white and owning all R&B [rhythm and blues] stations.  They, the civil rights pressures were very intense.  The question of servicing the black community was very intense, and so it was a time for, and when, that, and they wanted to sell.
Story_ID: 6262
Speaker 1: And do you know or can you just give a little background on black radio in this country, and--you know, because this is--I know that in Chicago [Illinois], you know, we had we had WVON [Chicago, Illinois radio station]--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That was--.
Speaker 2: That was not owned by black folks though.
Speaker 1: It wasn't owned by black, no, that's what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but I'm just--that's why I was asking a little history lesson.  A lesson about black radio.
Speaker 2: Well, there, you know, there was somebody in Kansas City [Missouri].  There was Dr. Bell, they had WHJB [radio station] in Detroit [Michigan].  Then, after that, it was Percy and, Percy Sutton [founder of Inner City Broadcasting Company], and then me.
Speaker 1: And so here you are, you consummate this deal.  Can you talk about how you feel the day, it was February 28th, right, 1973?
Speaker 2: Emancipation.  And I celebrated it by taking my son to a [Pittsburgh] Penguins hockey game (laughs).  We--the closing took all day, but it was a father and son night at his, at St. Edmund's Academy [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] where he was in school.  We went out, and I went to a hockey game and had two hot dogs and a beer for celebration.  But we had a huge celebration party on that Friday.  It was, I felt like I had cut the umbilical cord of dependence.
Speaker 1: And when you say the umbilical cord of dependence, it's dependence from just having a J-O-B or for, or more representative of what it meant for the black race or not?  (Laughs)
Speaker 2: Not having a--but I was economically independent, that my future was in my own hands.  I mean, I'm going to be very--I was doing these things because I believed in what I was doing.  I wanted to show by example the things that you could do.  I believed that blacks folks were as talented anybody.  But I was doing it--well, as I said, to show as an example.  But I wasn't, I wasn't doing it for black people.  I'm not trying to suggest that I'm that magnanimous.  You know, I was doing it because--but I was doing it to show black people that these kinds of things can be done.
Story_ID: 6263
Speaker 1: So you--this is an exciting day, and you, you know, you feel that you've proven something.  And so that's the first part.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then the real work really begins with the properties [Sheridan Broadcasting Network] that you've inherited.  And why don't you just sort of take us, you know, through that process.
Speaker 2: We--I had to hire a president.  And I was asked by the bank, "What would happen if you got hit by a car?"  I brought a number of other investors, blacks.  All black ones.  And I said--I needed--we needed someone to be able to take my place in case I did get hit by a car, and that person was Regan Henry.  And we went back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] together--he's a very smart guy.  A brilliant guy.  And he came in as a partner, as an investor. And, you know, we hired a president by the name of Paul Yates.  And he did a good job at first, and then a not so good job.  You know, I made every mistake known to man in terms of the--I had ideas about what I wanted to do and what I wanted the company to do.  And what happened was--what I learned over the years is that--and I'm up and down.  We wound up selling WILD [Boston, Massachusetts radio station] and paying off much of the debt with that.  But we also--you know, 'cause remember I was trying to show, I think, black folks what I thought we could do. We wish to do, what we still do are black college All-American football team called the Sherman Black College All-American.  And we've been doing the dinner since 1973 for thirty years.  You know, since '74 [1974], pardon me.  And in 1981 or thereabouts, we were gonna do the dinner in Mississippi.  And they asked us--what I was asked to do a black college all-star game.  And I raised a little money, and put in a lot of money to put on an all-star game in Jackson, Mississippi for all the symbolic reasons.  Bill Winter was the governor of Mississippi and my friends talked to him.  Well it was a disaster.  We lost a ton of--I'm talking about I took an eight count on that.  It almost took me out of here.  And then we did one again in '82 [1982] and then we got an ice storm. So I said, "I've given up on football."  You know.  But--'cause I didn't understand the economics of all-star games.  But I'd committed to again trying to show black folks how this stuff is done, and what was important.  And what I learned was that no one can live your dream but you.  Not--people can mouth the words.  They can appear to understand what you're talking about.  But the execution mode won't be there. You have to do that.  That you will make these decision in terms of the risk and in terms of what's involved.  And so in 1985 I took over the company and began to run it.  And I also realized that, you know, that it's important for people to have a payday.  And I bought out all my partners, you know. So that now the company is 100 percent owned by my family.
Speaker 1: And you made the decision to buy out all of your partners because it would be simpler, or because you wanted people to--who had been patient with you to have the payday that you were talking about?
Speaker 2: A combination.  I thought it  would be--frankly the primary motivation--'cause they're not putting up a lot of money.  They did very well.  But they did not put up a lot of money.  'Cause we--when  we--the investors we had I said--I mentioned the 2.2 million dollars--$200,000. We raised $55,000 all from among the whole group.  So it wasn't a lot of money.  But they got a good payday.  But I thought it was just easier if I was only responsible to myself and my family.  Right.
Speaker 1: Now that you said was in 1970--.
Speaker 2: No no, it was 1985.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) '85 [1985].  Okay.
Speaker 2: I completed the--I took over in '85 [1985] and I bought everybody  out in 1987, '88 [1988] something like that.
Speaker 1: Well during that time the radio landscape was changing too, and how many affiliate relationships did you--you know, the stations I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You  had three stations.
Speaker 2: We had five stations.
Speaker 1: You had five stations.
Speaker 2: Pardon me, we have now.  At that time we had three.  We had sold WILD.
Story_ID: 6264
Speaker 1: So you had those stations.  What are you learning about running--you know, the dynamics of really to running a successful radio operation?
Speaker 2: Well it's sales and sales and sales and sales and service.  Sales and service.  And that's, you know.  You try to put the right people in the right places.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) 'Cause remember, we had the network, and the network was a major operation and we were doing very well with it.  It's a very demanding--it's a highly competitive operation.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the network and how you assembled that network and--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Remember I bought Mutual Black Network.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Just talk about that.
Speaker 2: I bought Mutual Black Network and changed the name to Sheridan Broadcasting Network.  And we had 120 affiliates or thereabouts.  And then I brought in, in '87 [1987] a president who knew how to sell and market and then we just managed to grow it.  Then the first Gulf World War [sic, U.S. Operation Desert Storm in Iraq, 1991] knocked us for a loop, because advertising died.  We had two competing urban or black networks, which was Sheridan Broadcasting Network, and National Black Network.  And I concluded that I could win a one front war but not a two front war.  And so I negotiated a merger of the Sheridan Broadcasting with National Black and created the American Urban Radio Networks.  And it's been, you know, successful.  We have roughly 6.5 to 7 percent of all the network radio audience in the country.
Speaker 1: And talk about your programming. Because urban radio, you know.  Even that term urban radio is--.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Developed--.
Speaker 2: Well see, to me that's--it's still a word.  It's nomenclature, but it's sort of like meaningless.  Because what was the rhythm and blues when I was a child is now called urban 'cause--to give it a more acceptable flair to--for white folks practically (laughs).  That's what it boils down to.  A marketing term.  Because these stations were owned by whites to a large percent, and they didn't wanna say they owned a urban--pardon, rhythm and blues station.  I'm proud to own a rhythm and blues station.  They wanted sorta to call it urban contemporary and the rest of it.  But this is just really general marketing music because everybody listens to it.
Speaker 1: And so what was your--you know, I think it's important for people to understand the niche--I mean, the difference between radio station ownership and this affiliate relationship where you're essentially a programmer.
Speaker 2: The difference is that we provide--it's a service.  We provide a news program for the hour, quarter-hour or the fifty rather.  People buy commentary programs.  We provide weekend entertainment programs, hip-hop, R&B [rhythm and blues], countdowns and so forth.  You know.  Whereas with the radio station, you have a license and we now have five radio stations and we're licensed for that.  And the network is a whole different ballgame. Those--you know, those are just contracts which can in ninety days they can go away.
Story_ID: 6265
Speaker 1: And how were you successful at sort of growing your affiliate relationships?
Speaker 2: Aggressively (laughs).  You know, it's providing service.  Service, service, service, service, ideas, ideas, ideas, ideas.
Speaker 1: And your focus--how did you decide--'cause, you know, where you were gonna set up your sales operation and what--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well the major advertisers--well you follow the advertisers and they're in New York [New York], and Chicago [Illinois], and Detroit [Michigan]. So you go to New York, Chicago and Detroit.
Speaker 1: But there was receptiveness to something that was sort of--you know, 'cause a lot of times in radio it was felt that local, local, local was the best thing. But you--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Networks--not on the network side.  Remember, network--what it is, is the radio is an advertising vehicle. What you can do is that you put together a package of stations. We deliver four hundred stations for an advertiser at a very financially effective rate--way, rather.
Speaker 1: And if people--for people--I mean, I--for people to understand what Sheridan Broadcasting [Network]--when they're listening to it, what programs they're hearing right now today? What would be some of the things that go out?
Speaker 2: Well we have the John Monds countdown program on Saturday, he's based at [W]KYS [radio station] in Washington [D.C.]. We had--I don't have a list of the programs in front of me. But we had the only black White House desk with a White House [Washington, D.C.] correspondent who travels with the President. So, you know, we're just there.
Speaker 1: Okay. And okay. You--do you wanna comment at all with the whole difference between, you know, AM being most predominant and then FM sort of taking over? You don't wanna--no?
Speaker 2: 'Cause I think it's an evolutionary thing. Technology, technology will drive what we do.
Story_ID: 6266
Speaker 1: Now as you sit here today, you know, with Sheridan Broadcasting [Network], what are your hopes sort of for the future?  And what do you want--you know, what things do you want to accomplish that you haven't?
Speaker 2: Well, my goal very simply is for Sheridan Broadcasting to be the preeminent vehicle reaching black people in the English-speaking world. Okay.
Speaker 1: And with the changes in the radio, you know--the whole sort of radio landscape.  You know, with there  being more consolidation and things like that.  Does that give you concern or--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No. Well it neither concerns me or doesn't concern me. I mean I think that it's all a question of the technology and economics. You cannot devise a solution to problems that does not take into consideration the laws of economics and technology. I mean, it's like the computer and the TV set becoming one--which they are. You know. So no, I don't worry about that. I don't worry about something that I cannot influence. And, you know, it's like, you know. You're talking about the consolidation in concentration, which is a legitimate concern. But that's a whole different ballgame, you know. And I worry more about where technology is going and how I can be of some influence where things are not settled.
Speaker 1: And what has allowed you though, to remain so current? You know, in terms of programming? 'Cause programming has--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) 'Cause of younger people.  Not me. I don't know any--I tell my employees and people, "The public tells us what we think." So it's keeping your hand on the pulse of where the public is. Okay.
Story_ID: 6267
Speaker 1: What I'd like to understand when you look at Sheridan Broadcasting [Network], what things do you feel that you did very right?  You know, you said always being current, but what things do you feel you did very right, and what things do you feel that you made mistakes?
Speaker 2: You know, I think the ability of any company to grow is--will be determined by the quality of the people.  And I put some very good people in some very good positions, and I've not done such a good job with some other people. I mean, I think that's key. I'm not a broadcaster in the sense of knowing what people want, but it's identifying the right people and putting them in the right places.
Speaker 1: And besides the one thing, you know, where you where you went after the, you know, the football games, were there other things? You know, 'cause you said, "I almost--We almost took--." But were there other things that, you know, were--and the Gulf War [1991] you mentioned.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: That were sort of scary times or you think, could have been, you know, sort of near calamities?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I had an opportunity--a deal really to buy Earl Graves' [publisher] stations in Dallas, Texas with a lot of money. I had it financed. That is, I had the money to close and I didn't close. And I put up, you know, nearly $300,000 of my own money towards that as good faith measure. And I walked away from it. Because I knew that I could not afford to make a mistake. I thought that that the financial analysis that my people had done was not strong. And I'd rather lose the 300,000 than run the risk of losing everything. Which is what I did.
Speaker 1: So you think that was a correct decision?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) In the sense that--In the sense that with the information that I had at my disposal at that time it was the correct decision. You see the problem was I could not have afforded to make a mistake. And I--you know, I don't put myself in positions where I can't afford to make a mistake. Yeah. I figure I'll make a lot of mistakes, because people make mistakes. And things don't go as quickly as you would like.
Story_ID: 6268
Speaker 1: Now who are you--In your life I'd like just to spend a few minutes, you know, talking sort of philosophically, and we'll be finished. But I'm just wondering, you know, where you are and what things that maybe you--you know you your--is your son [Ronald Davneport, Jr.]--your son's involved right?
Speaker 2: And my daughter [Susan Davenport].
Speaker 1: Okay. In the business.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so you've--the thing that you set out to was to create, you know, an economic base for the family has really happened.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And yet I also saw that they had followed your steps in terms of, you know, your son went to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Harvard Business School--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Harvard [University] Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Harvard Law School, sorry. And your daughter went--.
Speaker 2: Well my young daughter who's in the business went to Harvard College and Stanford [University] Business School [Stanford, California].  And then I have another daughter [Judith Allison Davenport] who's the television producer in Los Angeles [California] who went to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].
Story_ID: 6269
Speaker 1: And so I'm just wondering when you look back, you know, at the point you are right now--what things do you want to accomplish maybe that you haven't with your life? You know? I mean you set out with this goal here.  And you have--you know, you set it out. You've accomplished it. You know. And so I'm just wondering what things do you want? You're in, you know, a time period that may be a little more reflected on--I know you've done philanthropic things too, but--.
Speaker 2: You know I--again it's a question of creating opportunity and setting examples and to inform people of what--how the country works.  In other words, you hear a lot of people with large titles and nice offices, but can't make decisions.  And what's important from my perspective is that black folks understand the country will be big enough when you're making decisions.  The country is big enough for us. But that the goal in life is to be in a decision-making capacity. That's what it's all about.
Story_ID: 6270
Speaker 1: And when you look at--so what things do you think that African Americans have to do, you know, that are sort of critical now to move us more into decision-making capable--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well I think the--it's already in motion. By that, I mean right now there are maybe 150 black law students at Harvard [University] Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]--approximately. If you were to take all the Ivy League schools, sister schools, and put them all together, go from 1960 to '62 [1962] on back to when they were founded, you'd be hard pressed to get 150 black graduates. We have 150 now at Harvard and the rest of these schools. And what will happen is--when I became a law professor at Duquense [University School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] I was the third black on a white law faculty in the history of this country. I was not brought there to be dean of the law school. I learned how the system works. When I became dean of the law school in 1970, I was the first black dean of a white law school in the history of the country. And I think that what will happen is when all these people who are now being cranked out of these institutions right across the country, that some will succeed or fail like everybody succeeds or fails. And some will look for special support systems and they'll find that they're not there. But some will also figure out how the system works and will make it work for them. And I'm very confident, you know, that we'll hold our own. It's just like going back to the Jackie Robinson [baseball player] in baseball times. That we--people kept us out of the game. But once we were allowed to play, some of us excelled and some of us didn't. We're gonna be held to a higher standard. That is if you're black, you don't ride the bench. You play. But if you--once you get a chance to play, then it's just a question of your skills or talents period. In the final analysis, America will essentially govern or evaluate you on the basis of your talent, not your color. But there will be certain expectations initially, because of your color. They'll see your black face, and there will be certain expectations. But if you're in the game, you will be evaluated on the basis of your talent.
Speaker 1: So you really believe that America has the capability of being a color-blind society?
Speaker 2: Oh, I never said that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never said that. Because when it counts--for people who can compete for positions of power, they'll use color, sex, religious background, economic--whatever they can to--to enhance their own capability. So no. I never said that we would be color-blind. I don't think we'll ever become color-blind. But what I'm saying is that even though--what the civil right bill--the civil rights bill in '64 [Civil Rights Act, 1964] and '65 [Voting Rights Act, 1965]--civil rights bills in '64 [1964] and '65 [1965], when they passed which--that is, which prohibited employment discrimination in '64 [1964] and voting in '65 [1965], okay. All prohibitions on black advancement had been removed. There're still barriers.  But when I was coming out of law school and I was looking for a job in the industry there were prohibitions--you didn't get into the game. We're in the game. That's all--that's all we need frankly, is to be in the game.
Story_ID: 6271
Speaker 1: So do you have any concerns about the black community and its future within that context? Because what you're talking about is, you know, once there--you know, that African Americans need to be prepared to be in the game. If you're prepared then, things will be okay.
Speaker 2: I'm saying that we're in the game, you see. And I think that once you're in the game, you have to be open to what the rules of the game are. And, you know, that doesn't mean there are--if you're six feet tall that you don't jump center. You play guard. So you learn how to shoot from the outside, because you can't jump center. You see. You learn how to use the talents that we have. I mean, look--we are the yeast in the American society. That's very important. That's very powerful. You take a look at the hip-hop generation, they've done a better job of empowering black people than any generation that we've ever had. They've done a phenomenal job. And I respect them for it. So no, we're in the game. And I'm very optimistic. As (unclear) you hear that, and people will say, "Well yeah. But that's just a handful of the elite. And they'll do well, but how about ordinary black people?" I think that the elite will discover that their strength is in the strength of black people. And as long as black people are weak, they are weak. And so some of them will take advantage of being there to drive the fancy cars and forget about where they came from. But I think the more thoughtful ones will say, "We have to help the majority of the black community in order for us to be really--have strength that we need to have in the American society."
Story_ID: 6272
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I don't think about legacies in that sense. I'm not as concerned about that. I am concerned about educating people. I'm not concerned about having a monument to myself in that sense. I want--my goal is merely to participate in the education and the enlightenment of black people. And that's sufficient for me.
Speaker 1: Okay. And in the education of black people, do you feel that people who are educating have some moral response--I mean what goes along with that education is what I'm trying to ask? You know? I mean you say--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I believe in self interest. And I think that when people do what's in their self interest is what they will continue to do. I think that people that say they're doing things for altruistic reasons. And that well may be, but that is hard to sustain and it's hard to do on a broad-range basis. And so, you know, I'm not talking--so what I'm driving at, I think is that if people understand their self-interests then they will do what they have to really do. And that's what I mean in terms of educating people.
Story_ID: 6273
Speaker 1: And what do you want to be remembered for?  Not just educating people--what do you want--what do you want people--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's--
Speaker 1: Or what--you don't care about what people say about Ronald Davenport?
Speaker 2: No I--well I care. Of course we all care. But that's not the motivating factor. I'll tell you this much. My--the fellow who hired me as dean, he said, "Ron, what would you like to be?" and I said, "I'd like to be dean of the law school." I never thought I'd be dean of Duquesne [University School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], frankly. He said, 'Well why?" I said, "Well for the power and prestige, of course." I said, "But if nobody on earth knew I was dean but me, I'd still wanna be dean for the opportunity of service."
Speaker 1: (pause) And what were you saying in saying that? I mean the under--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well what--it's the making a contribution to make our society a better place. I want that. If you say that's a legacy, I'm gonna feel within myself. Not to have the public say, "Oh he really made America a better place." I mean, it's nice to have. Who would not want it? But that's not the motivating force. The motivating force is that I think that America can be a better place and that I feel the responsibility to try and make it that. And if nobody knows what I've done but me, that's, that's fine with me.
