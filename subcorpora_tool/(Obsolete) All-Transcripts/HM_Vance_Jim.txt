Speaker 1: So before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 2: Yes.  Actually there's two of them also.  My favorite dest- (makes sound) vacation destination is either Saint Martin in the Caribbean or Durango, Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Pause) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 637223
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [James Vance, Jr.] side, but separately, and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us, first your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Mother's full name was Eleanor--her maiden name?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Eleanor Cheeks--Cheek Littlejohn: E-L-E-A-N-O-R, C-H-E-E-K, L-I-T-T-L-E-J-O-H-N [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance].
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I don't know.  It was in February--
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty [1920] something, you think or was she--
Speaker 2: In the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: In the '20s [1920s]?
Speaker 2: Here's what's interesting about my mother.  One, I don't know all that much about her; two, we had a strange and strained relationship.  Three, my mother was adopted by my grandfather [Joseph Littlejohn], that particular grandfather.  I have her birth certificate on which, as I recall, I don't know that there's a name.  From what I am told by my family, my mother is the product of a liaison, illicit liaison, between a very wealthy white woman somewhere outside of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and a footman, a black footman.  The footman, of course, the guy who rides on the carriage and then gets off to open the door, put the stool, so whoever's riding can step more gently onto ground.  And as soon as she--well, before she was born, my mother's mother was sent away, I am told somewhere in Michigan.  My mother was born and, I mean, five seconds later was put up for adoption.  How and why my grandfather got her, I have no idea, bo- they are obviously both gone.  She's one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in my life, very fair, with straight hair it went all the way down here back, as I recall when she was young.  I never had the sense, ever, even when I was--from when I could first remember that my mother was really happy that I was born.  She did all the right things.  She came to my--played a lot of sports when I was in school, she'd come to the football games, she'd--I did a lot of singing, come to concerts and other things I would do, I did.  And I always had the sense that my mother was doing what she was supposed to do.
Story_ID: 637224
Speaker 1: Do you want me to go on with this or do you want to--?
Speaker 2: No, go ahead (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  A seminal moment was in 1981.  I had an addiction problem for seven years.  In 1981, I went to a place in Summit, New Jersey, treatment center, for the first time.  I went three other times, but that was the first one.  And it was determined by the staff there very early that I had some serious issues with my mother [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance].  So they called her.  I hadn't seen my mother in a couple of years.  And they called her to come up to the center, which she did, and they put us in a room with two chairs and then the counselor was over here.  And we sat facing each other and didn't say much and the counselor said to me, I'll never forget this, "What would you like to say to your mother?"  And my thought was, nothing, and then I said--the words I said were, "Well, I don't ever remember you hugging me, ever."  And my mother sat there, God bless her to her credit, I guess, and said, "Jimmy [HistoryMaker Jim Vance], I'm just not the hugging kind," which I accepted as truth.  And I respected her for speaking the truth.  And we sat there.  It was a hour we were supposed to be together, that was five minutes in.  We sat there for the next fifty-five minutes and never said a word, neither one of us to each other.  And I wasn't uncomfortable in those fifty-five minutes because I didn't have anything to say, and it was clear, and she didn't have anything to say either.  What I didn't know at that time was that, that, it was volcanic, my emotions, my feelings, my loss, sadness, anger, all those things that I had--at that point I was forty, I was thirty-nine.  I had learned quite well how to suppress all those things.  When I finally got clean in '87 [1987], I went to a psychiatric counseling for five years more.  And in the course of that came to terms with my real feelings about my mother.  And it took years, it took fifteen, twenty years before I finally got to the point of acknowledging, not acknowledging, of honestly forgiving her.  I think I know for what.  But, at the time I recall I wasn't sure what am I forgiving her for but I need to do this for me to move on, whatever the reasons are.  And so I did with the conclusion that she probably did the best she could considering, you know, whatever, whatever her issues were.  So, when you asked me when my mother was born, it's difficult to say, I mean, because I never cared much about what her birthday was.  I remember, not remember, she died in '88 [1988].  I don't think I ever missed sending my mother a card or a call or a gift or something in all my adult years, but I was reminded by a significant other or one of my children of when her birthday was ahead of time so I could go and do it, because they knew that otherwise I would--otherwise I would forget it.  But for many of the years of my life, talking about my mother would have been a sore spot and difficult and I probably would have refused.  I don't anymore.  There's a considerable sense of liberation and growth that comes from the forgiveness and the acknowledgement that she probably did the best she could.  And, not the least, who am I to judge her or anybody else.  And if I'm going to ever be tolerant and forgiving of myself or anybody else, probably begins with her, so.
Story_ID: 637225
Speaker 1: Where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: She grew up in the Ardmore area [Ardmore, Pennsylvania], as far as I know, and was quite popular, as I understand.  But you know, I can tell you a whole lot more about every other member of my fam- and they were--my f- grandparents on my father's side [Elizabeth Vance and James Vance, Sr.] had sixteen kids, so there was a bunch of uncles and aunts and cousins and everybody else.  I can tell you more about cousins than I can tell you about my mother [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance], cause I--if I ever knew, I forgot and I'm not sure I ever really knew, because I'm not sure I ever cared in an active kind of way.  I certainly cared internally, but learned successfully how to put that away.
Speaker 1: So, were you raised with your mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was raised--well, that's a whole 'nother, see, yes.  I was born in January of '42 [1942].  My father [James Vance, Jr.] came home from the war [World War II, WWII].  And I lived with my mother and my grandparents at my father's parents' house.  Grandfather [sic.] came home in '45 [1945].  They bought a house right around the corner, and so from '45 [1945] until '51 [1951] when he died, he drank himself to death, but we lived in that house, the three of us.  Interesting memories because I love--I drove by that house yesterday and had a wonderful feeling of a nostalgic warmth, which was tempered immediately by terror because there's a lot of drama in that house, a lot of conflict, and a goodly share of physical violence, not to me, but each other.  They went at it hard.
Speaker 1: So he passed in--when did you say your father passed?
Speaker 2: August of '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951], okay.
Speaker 2: Cirrhosis and DTs [delirium tremens], which I--I'm kind of convinced it's probably one of the worst ways any man could die, in terms of the horror of it.
Story_ID: 637226
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance], did, did she finish high school in, in (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Actually, my mother went to boarding school.  Are you familiar--well, listen to me, (laughter) interviewing you.  There was a boarding school--there were a couple of boarding schools that were notable for black people back in those days, in the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s].  I forget where the men's school was; it was in Tennessee or Louisiana, maybe Alabama, but there was one called Palmer Institute for Women's [Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute, Sedalia, North Carolina]--and that's where my mother met--in fact, met and was a friend for a period of time with Nat King Cole's wife.  I can't remember her name.
Speaker 1: Maria.
Speaker 2: Was it Maria, Maria Cole--
Speaker 1: I think it was Maria Cole.
Speaker 2: I forget what her maiden name was.  But anyway, they knew and befriended each other in school.  So she graduated from Palmer Institute for Women I think it was called, and I don't remember exactly--I think it was in Virginia, if I'm not mistaken or maybe North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've heard it before.  I'm not sure if it's Virginia or North Carolina, it's one of the two.
Speaker 2: Somewhere in the South.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Palmer Institute, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she completed her high school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at Palmer Institute.  And did she go on to college?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She went to work right away.  For most of my life, my mother worked for the federal government, for the CIGNA corp [Insurance Company of North America; CIGNA], as a matter of fact, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So she had was it a clerical position?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: But you know what, let me tell you about that.  I'm not sure why she didn't do more.  My mother was one of the more brilliant people that I've known.  Very erudite, very well read, well spoken, on my case all the time about proper usage of the language, committed to proper presentation of myself: the poise, the way I carried myself, looking somebody in the eye, shaking hands, the kinds of things, you know, we try to get our kids in hell to do with varying degrees of success.  But those things were paramount and daily, in my opinion.  And that was from her.  Also, one of the gifts that I got from my mother, I do appreciate, one was an appreciation for fine tea, and the other was an addiction to crossword puzzles.  My mother never, I don't think I ever saw her in all my life, until she died in '88 [1988] without a crossword puzzle somewhere.  And I'm not talking about those little daily things.  She did The New York Times puzzles, she did the London Times [The Times] puzzle, which I have never in my life finished.  And I give her all props for that because she'd do 'em (snaps fingers) like that, so.  I was--very bright woman who presented herself well, but never sought to go further in her education for some reason.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 637227
Speaker 1: She was a- you said she was adopted by (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Joe Littlejohn [Joseph Littlejohn], um-hm.
Speaker 1: --your maternal grandfather, I guess?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So he would be?  Yeah. So--
Speaker 2: One--
Speaker 1: --that side of the family is not really related to you by blood?
Speaker 2: No.  And you know it's interesting--Larry [Larry Crowe] is it?  I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Not--because only in the last, not more than five years, has it occurred to me, have I questioned whether that part of my history is lost.  Will I--I only began caring about that, about five years ago.  And in doing so, it occurred to me what a dilemma I have here because I have no idea where even to begin.  There are, as far as I can tell, no records of any kind of my mother's family.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  So is it possible, I'm just thinking here is it possible that your mother [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance] is actually related to someone in your grandfather's family that raised her?  I mean, you know, is she actually related to that African American side of the family?
Speaker 1: I would doubt that sincerely.  Well, let me stop.  Well, yes, I would doubt it.  But I have no way of knowing.  I don't know that there's anyone left alive on that side who would know anything.  I have not had contact with anyone on that side of the family for probably thirty or forty years.  One of the better things that my mother ever did for me is every summer in August she would send me to, or take me in the beginning, was sent from the time I was about seven to North Carolina where her father's people were sharecroppers in a town called Bunn, North Carolina, worked mostly tobacco crop.  And I would spend the month of August down there from time I was seven until I guess maybe twelve.  And it is there that I met the--my grandfather's relatives who I adored and loved and who in fact informed my youth and my development as a human being, because they are people of great dignity who had next to nothing in the way of opportunity and or creature goods--creature comforts.  But I remember them as some of the more noble people that I've ever known in my life in terms of their dignity and their character and their, their worldview.  And I mean worldview 'cause they did have a worldview.  As unlettered as they were, they were aware of what was going on everywhere and saw to it that I was too; it was important to them.
Story_ID: 637228
Speaker 1: Whether my [maternal adoptive] grandfather [Joseph Littlejohn] had any relationship with that footman [Vance's biological maternal grandfather], I never knew and never questioned as a matter of fact.  I'm not even sure quite frankly that it was a footman.  That story may be apocryphal, I have no idea.
Speaker 2: Well, it just seems strange that there would even be a footman in the 1920s with--I mean--
Speaker 1: With cars?
Speaker 2: --yeah, with cars, you know, who knows?
Speaker 1: Interesting point and I asked about that.  I did ask my aunts about that at one point.  And they made--oh, wow you brought something out I hadn't thought about in sixty years.  My--and when I brought that up to my [paternal] aunt Vivi [Vivian Vance], who's now 102, she said to me, "Do you remember the junkyard?"  And like what?  She said, "The junkyard on Lancaster Avenue in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]," scrap yard where my grandfather and I and some of my uncles sometimes would take scrap metal to sell.  And in front of the scrap yard, right in the middle of West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], was this big circular, not a cistern, but a tank, not a--a fountain, where horses drank water because most of the scrap dealers--our milk was delivered until 1949 or '50 [1950], maybe '51 [1951], with a guy driving a milk wagon with a horse that pulled milk.  The point I'm trying to make, horses were still in use, not only in--they were in use in the '40s [1940s] in my particular part of town, well, in Philadelphia, and all over Philadelphia there were big tanks in the middle of streets where horses drank.  So, it is not--
Speaker 2: That's a good point, that's a good point--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --because that transition--I remember even--I was born in '49 [1949], but I remember some horses still--
Speaker 1: There you go.
Speaker 2: --where I grew up, some.
Speaker 1: So you know maybe they did it for sport, you know, like we have an old vintage car or something like that now.  They kept a particularly well made Packard carriage and, or particularly fine brand of horse or whatever the case.  So, good point, and I did ask about that but the point I'm trying to make though is I just don't know what's true, what's not true, what--and I am--I have lost--my distance from my mother [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance] sometimes even enmity prevented me from seeking information, important information, when it might have been available to me many years ago from people who might have known.  They are all gone now.  There is no one left who would be able to speak the truth.  And I don't know of any written document of any kind that would give me a clue.
Story_ID: 637229
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense of where her, I guess, sense of propriety came from?  I mean as--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) did that come from your [maternal adoptive] grandfather [Joseph Littlejohn], or?
Speaker 2: No.  Palmer.
Speaker 1: Palmer Institute [Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute, Sedalia, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Remember those schools were very stringent in terms of discipline and carriage and poise and--remember the old charm schools and the cotillions back in the day.  I remember as a child the first time I ever put a tux [tuxedo] on was to go to some cotillion.  There was a time--there was a time, Larry [Larry Crowe], and I'm sure you might remember when some black folks really tried hard not to be black and tried very hard to be as white as they could possibly be by doing all the things that white people did that they thought, you know, made them--separated them from whatever it was they sought to remove themselves from.  So, yes--so my mother [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance]--and I remember her speaking of a charm school that she went to someplace where they--the gloves, the hat, you know, the whole nine yards like that.  Do you recall, I'm talking to you now, Sunday--Saturday was an important--I mean people worked very hard from Monday to Friday.  On Saturday, and many Saturdays every now and again though Saturday come, we would go to Gimbels [Gimbel Brothers] or Strawbridge and Clothier's [Strawbridge and Clothier, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], or, what was the other one?  I forget, to the department store, women in the '40s [1940s] and up to the mid-'50s [1950s] got dressed up to go to the department store.  My mother and everybody else, all the other women, they put gloves on and the hats to go shop.  Don't get on a train, you know, to go wherever you want to go, got dressed up to go on a train.  I remember when airplanes became the most popular mode of travel, very few of us ever traveled but when those who did, I'm talking about in the '50s [1950s], I remember a couple of aunts of mine went to Bermuda, you'd think they were going to a wedding the way they got dressed up and anyway.  So yes, I think her sense of decorum came from both Palmer Institute and from that whole genre, that whole--plus the fact, my mother being fair skinned.  Back in those days fair skinned black people did tend to, if only subconsciously, separate themselves, or seek to.  And this is not a knock on her 'cause it was the way things were back then, but light skinned black people got better jobs, light skinned black people got treated better and so light skinned black people liked that (laughter) so they worked it, you know, as best they could.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's an assumption of higher status even though the person may not--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --barely--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --know anything about it, or sense of it.
Speaker 2: Yes, it could have been the scum of the earth, but if they were light skinned then they were thought better of than a darker skinned person at the time, so.  I assume her decorum came from those places (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 637230
Speaker 1: You mentioned your [maternal adoptive] grandfather [Joseph Littlejohn], but did you have a grandmother--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --on that side too?
Speaker 2: Never met a grandmother on that side.  I read somewhere or heard somewhere that she died earl- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was she alive when your mother [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance] was adopted?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was alive, as far as I know when my mother was adopted and never met, never met her.
Speaker 1: Okay, and were there other children?
Speaker 2: No.  She was an only child.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was thinking that, but I didn't know it.  I just wondered if--
Speaker 2: My mother was an only child, as was I.  Lots of cousins, but I was the only offspring of--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of my mother and my father [James Vance, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that kind of maybe explains the Palmer Institute [Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute, Sedalia, North Carolina] and all that, you know, because you can pour the resources into one person.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What did your grandfather do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a landscaper, and probably the meanest son of a bitch I've ever known in my life.  That was not a happy man.  And I'm trying to remember--a couple of times I remember him smiling or laughing.  My gran- there was a black Boy Scout troop in my area, and it was only one and it drew from, you know, many of the other suburban communities.  And my grandfather was a commissioner in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], but who participated with us when we were, you know, twelve, thirteen years old, on hikes and on camping trips and on those other kinds of things.  And every now and again, or not every now and again, I do have a couple of recollections of him smiling every now and again, but not many.  He was a hardworking man for which I give him all props with a commendable work ethic.  I would work with him from time to time when I was young, but I--not all that often because I really preferred working with my paternal grandfather [James Vance, Sr.] and his sons 'cause it was way more fun.  One, the plumbing work was more--it was work with my hands, but it also required a good deal of mental activity as well.  But anyway, I never got along with him very well.  We never fought--I don't ever remember him being certainly not abusive in any kind of way either psychologically or physically, but once again it was the sense I had and you know, I was a child so who knows from whence that feeling came, or whether it was accurate or not, but it was real, so therefore--.  But anyway I always had a sense that he'd be just as happy if I wasn't around.
Speaker 1: Now he, he was the primary parent of your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Only--I think for most of her life, he was the only parent.  I think her mother died, or his wife died early in my mother's life, like somewhere before ten.  And so he raised her as much as I could tell by himself except with the influence of--he had a brother who lived also in Ardmore [Pennsylvania], couple of blocks away.  And his brother had a wife.  Interestingly, they were very solicitous to me.  And went out of the way whenever I was in their house to see to it that I was comfortable and that I was happy; very kind people, quite the opposite of my grandfather, my mother's father.
Story_ID: 637231
Speaker 1: Now did you- your maternal [adoptive] grandfather [Joseph Littlejohn] w- did he landscape on the Main Line, was that what--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All the estates and homes of the middle class, the upper middle class and the very wealthy white folks.
Speaker 1: Shortly after I first heard about the Main Line, because--and I'm from Ohio, and I didn't--hear about it, but I saw the movie 'The Philadelphia Story' with Katharine Hepburn and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: That was that.
Speaker 1: That was on the Main Line.
Speaker 2: That was it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So I saw it on Turner Classic Movies [TCM].  It was one of the times when The HistoryMakers was down 'cause the stock market crashed in 2008, we didn't have a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Sitting home and I'm watching--I said this is, takes place on the Main Line, so.
Speaker 2: That's it.  Yeah.  I was in all those houses--
Speaker 1: Huge estates.
Speaker 2: --cleaning the toilets, yes, multi acre estates, I'm sorry estates.  All of this have been broken up now, but there's still an unspoken and recognized line of demarcation between the white inhabitants there and the black.  There's something that just now occurred to me, Larry [Larry Crowe].  In high school [Lower Merion High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania], I was okay in high school, kind of popular 'cause I was playing ball, sang a lot.  I never in all of my years from junior high [Ardmore Junior High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania] through high school visited the home of any of my white friends, and I had plenty of them.  Neither did any of them visit my home.  And we were all okay with that.  I didn't feel left out or slighted or any of other kind of thing.  We didn't party together.  We'd play ball together and you know if it's a school sponsored event, we were together.  But after that we all went our separate ways and it was just assumed and accepted that, okay, this is cool and this is the way it is.  But I hadn't thought about that before.
Speaker 1: I've often thought about--you were talking about the wearing of tuxedos at cotillions and all those things, you know, black people imitating--
Speaker 2: White people.
Speaker 1: --high white society on one level, but that means--but they're working in those homes and they're seeing--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I've often thought about that dynamic and how it informs the black community.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'll tell you about how it informed me, because I was in many of those homes when I was a child because I worked--when I wasn't in school or playing ball, I was working with either my [paternal] grandfather [James Vance, Sr.] or one of his sons.  And I would go to those homes, and the first thing, one thing I remember very clearly was that I always wished we could live like that.  Not so much the interior of the homes, but the exterior, the grounds, the landscaping, the green, the trees and all of that, one.  Two, I remember--oh, wow, you're bringing up some good stuff.  I never wanted to be like them.  When I was six or when I was sixteen, or when I was twenty-six, I would still go help my grandfather out, never wanted to be like them, there was nothing that they did that impressed me all that much.  The things that they had really didn't impress me all that much except for the cars, I did--'cause they had the TR3s [Triumph TR3] and they had the Morgans, the old Austin-Healeys, they had the big Packards with the wheel and the fender, you know, I mean.  Their automobiles I wanted, but their lifestyles did not impress me that much, and I have friends I was in school with who felt the same way.  None of us really aspired to be like those folks in whose homes we went to do labor.  And I give so much credit for that to my people and the people around me, the other people in my extended family.  I had the really good fortune of growing up with proud people who never for a minute, I'm trying to think if that's true.  Most of--well, certainly, everybody in my family and most of the people around me never for a minute felt in any way diminished or less than by their blackness.  All of them aspired to a better life, better lifestyle, one that would afford them more luxuries, if you will, but none of them were ashamed of being who they were and what they were and I had no way of ever leaning that way, and there was no reason to ever lean that way.  So I am exceedingly grateful to them for that.

Speaker 1: After my father [James Vance, Jr.] died, when I was, when I was nine, I went to live with my paternal grandparents [Elizabeth Vance and James Vance, Sr.].  And what that meant was I also lived with a number of their siblings who lived all around and who were in the house all the time.  In my childhood from nine to, I don't know, seventeen, when I left, there was hardly ever not at least seven people at the dinner table.  And dinner mattered and people, my people, made it a point to come together over a meal.
Speaker 2: So this is different from your mother's--
Speaker 1: Totally different.
Speaker 2: --because you got your mother [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance] and your [maternal adoptive] grandfather [Joseph Littlejohn]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and then you, that's it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --pretty much.
Speaker 1: And I did not spend much time in that environment even from the time I was born, most of my time was spent with my paternal grandparents.  Who, by the way, one lived here and the other lived right behind him.  I mean they were that close.
Speaker 2: Okay, so they were that close, physically?
Speaker 1: And never spoke.  I don't ever remember my paternal grandparent saying anything other than, "(Nods head) (Makes sound) Morning," or something like that to my maternal grandparent.  For some reason they didn't like each other, or didn't--they didn't bother to befriend each other (laughter), let me put it that way (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Story_ID: 637233
Speaker 1: All right, so now it's time to go to your father's side of the family, and then we'll try to bring them together.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  James Howard Vance, Jr. [James Vance, Jr.].  Same as above, except (laughter) he was number two.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was March 18th ninet- well, he was thirty-eight when he died in '51 [1951], so that would put him--I have to do the math and I can't do the math now, whatever thirty-eight is from 1951 (laughter).  So, if you take forty from 1951, you're at 1911 and two more is 1913?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That makes sense?
Speaker 1: That's right.  Nineteen thirteen [1913].  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Port Deposit, Maryland.  Port Deposit is a little hamlet down on the Susquehanna River which separates Pennsylvania from Maryland, and it was a quarry town.  There was a big quarry there.  There were a lot of the, I think the, not just the quartz, but what's the other--anyway, a lot of the stone that went into building--
Speaker 1: Limestone, or?
Speaker 2: --maybe limestone--granite, I think also granite.  A lot of buildings in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and in Washington [D.C.] and in Baltimore [Maryland] apparently came out of the quarry at Port Deposit.  It was also close by the Conowingo Dam, which was built, I think, in the early 20th century, supplying electric power and a lot of the people that didn't work in the quarry were there and there were farms around.  And when my father was born in 1913, I think it's '13 [1913], anyway, my grandfather [James Vance, Sr.] was a farmer.  He had, god, I don't know how many acres, twenty-six, not that much, but a few acres that they farmed.  He did that and also worked at the dam, if I'm not mistaken.  And the first of--he had sixteen kids, and the first, I think, eight or nine of them were born in Port Deposit.  Story goes that my grandmother [Elizabeth Vance], after the birth of one of my aunts, made it clear to my grandfather that she wasn't going to--did not want to live on a farm anymore or there, and that they had to move, at which point, my grandfather moved to, the whole family, to Ardmore [Pennsylvania], and took a job at the Baldwin Locomotive Works.  It used to be a place in Chester, Pennsylvania, which is about ten miles away.  This was the day of steam engines, I mean I think there were some diesels, but not many, mostly steam engines.  And Baldwin Locomotive made--was one of the manufactures of those steam engines.
Story_ID: 637234
Speaker 1: Could I tell you the story of why my [paternal] grandfather [James Vance, Sr.] is my hero from time eternal and always will be.  People often ask me, kids especially, who my heroes were, and I always begin, and sometimes even end with him, because while he was at the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 19--okay, hold on, Pinky--I was born in '42 [1942], my youngest uncle was born in '31 [1931], no '29 [1929].  Anyway, midway through the Depression [Great Depression], which started in '29 [1929] and works its way through the '30s [1930s], mid-'30s [1930s] at which point he had an infant child of, you know, one or two year old child, my grandfather, incredibly proud man and skilled beyond words, with his hands and ability to think through problems, he came up with something that made the process of whatever his line of work on the motive engine--on the engines was.  He told his supervisor, his supervisor told his boss, the supervisor got a raise and he got a promotion, my grandfather got diddly.  This man who stood, I think, 5'6" quit.  He couldn't bare that humiliation and disrespect.  Nothing was more important in America, as I understand it, I hadn't been born yet, but I read, than a job in 1930 or '31 [1931].  My grandfather had a steady job.  He quit and started his own business, and I often think and have for years of how difficult it is now for any man, particularly a black man, to start his own business in this country.  And this man with sixteen offspring, one of them just a baby and my aunts--he had other children who were five and ten years old, he quit a job to go out on his own as a plumber.  And I remember his first truck was a 1937 Ford panel truck, which I guess came later, but anyway, that's a stand up guy to me.  And he made it work, one.  Two, of those sixteen children, not a single one ever saw the inside of a jail, not a single one ever had a dime that he or she didn't earn.  Of those sixteen, several died, some even before I was born in '42 [1942].  But of the eleven that were around when I was a child, one, two, three, four, five, six went to college, several to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], one to Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and two to Cheyney [Cheyney Training School for Teachers; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania], where I eventually went.  But anyway, they were all the kind of people that any man or woman would welcome as a neighbor: good, hardworking, generous, thoughtful, people of faith.  He did that.  How many people do I know who have had every privilege imaginable or how many people do I know who, you know, like me and most of my people, got an opportunity to go to school and do some things and did it whose offspring are embarrassments to them, with all of our advantages, with Dr. Spock [Benjamin Spock], which my grandfather never had, but all of his kids.  There was one drunk in my family.  I'm sorry, there were two, my father [James Vance, Jr.] was the first and my--I had an uncle who I think was drunk every single day of his life, who lived, I think, to ninety years old and the family always held that the reason he lived so long--I mean he just died from old age by the way, nothing traumatic.  But my family always held that he lived so long because he had so much alcohol in him, there's not a germ on earth that could live in his body.  But anyway, my grandfather, in my view, is just the strongest, proudest, most respectable, noble creature.  And many times when I'm in--I have a dilemma or problem or an issue to deal with, I wonder and--I channel him, how would he handle this.  And everything that I do, I hope I do and I think about it consciously sometimes, I do it and hope it will make him proud.  And I mean I admire him that much. So anyway, he--talk about somebody informing somebody's life, he was a man in that regard.
Story_ID: 637235
Speaker 1: I will tell you among the most cherished moments of my life are at the end of a work day, and we would work hard, and he [Vance's paternal grandfather, James Vance, Sr.] was a severe taskmaster, but at the end of the day, we'd go home, we'd take showers, we'd eat dinner, especially in the summertime, and we'd sit out on the porch, there were rocking chairs out there, them old wicker rocking chairs.  We would sit out on the porch, he would smoke his pipe, and I would sit there with him and we wouldn't say a word to each other.  He was not a voluminous man in terms of conversation.  We wouldn't say a word to each other for two and a half hours, and I never felt more cherished, protected, loved, wanted than I did sitting on a porch with my grandfather on those evenings, never, with anybody else.  And this is with not a word being spoken and the joy of my life would be when he would give me a quarter, "Come here, boy, go around the corner and get me a--get me some of them ginger snaps and take a nickel, get what you want," or something he loved, what do you call it, I hate it, peach vanilla ice cream, "get me one of them cones."  And I'd wait, wait, he'd make me wait, wait, "Get one for yourself, too."  Had the deepest voice.  What's his name Barry, the guy that died?  Barry--what's his name?
Speaker 2: Barry White.
Speaker 1: Barry White.  He would love to have had my grandfather's voice.  Anyway, that was my man.  And anything that I am that's worthwhile, is to his credit and anything that I'm not, ain't his fault (laughter), that's how I regard and revere that man, and.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I have a small question.  It's about a small matter, but it's important.  Is there a story about how he acquired his plumbing skills or certification, or did he have to have it there?
Speaker 1: Interesting question, and thank you for asking.  I have no idea how he acquired his skills except as you probably know, there are people born with a gift, there are people that will make anything grow, there are people that can fix anything, he was the guy that could fix anything.  He just had that natural capacity about him.  He also had a goodly measure of business acumen.  He kind of understood how to make it work, even though he was a black man.  He was the only black man in the entire suburban area of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I think there were one or two in Philly, who had a master plumber's license.  How he did that, I don't know.  And I'll tell you why that's important, if I may.
Story_ID: 637236
Speaker 1: When I was five, it was 1947--damn, all these years. My father [James Vance, Jr.] and I were in the backyard of our house and he had bought a--he had bought a truck.  And we're putting lettering on the truck.  You know those stencil letters, you take a bucket and you put the letter in it and then you put it up on the truck, and he had lined it out, and we're putting it up on the truck: James H. Vance, Jr. and Son plumbing and heating [James H. Vance and Sons] was how it goes, and I was thrilled to do this because I was the and son.  I thought it was so cool that I had a business.  And this dude, he's--large man, tough guy, he started crying, and I never knew why, and I was afraid to ask and I didn't ask.  Years later, I was fourteen, I guess, what I learned was that--maybe twelve--what I learned was that that day, earlier that day, he had gone for the third time to the plumbers union [United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada] to get his master certification, which they wouldn't give him.  And it wasn't because he was not a master and masterful plumber, he had all the gifts that my [paternal] grandfather [James Vance, Sr.] had, rather because they decided they weren't doing that for black folks anymore, they weren't given out anymore plumbing license.  You make good living as a plumber, back then and (laughter) n- better now, and it, it, it broke him.
Story_ID: 637237
Speaker 1: My old man, from the time he came home in '45 [1945] until he died in 1951, what I remember of my father, among other things, that every single night he fought the war [World War II, WWII] again, and every night he'd scream and holler.  My bedroom was right next to theirs and sometimes I'd get up and go watch him.  And I remember he would even--he would dive out of bed and do that (gesture) fetal thing.  And then he'd get up the next day and go to work and then he'd come home that night then he'd get drunk.  And this guy who was okay as fodder for a war machine, was a piece of shit when he came back home.  I didn't take that well, and when I turned eighteen, this was in '60 [1960], no--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1960--
Speaker 1: --nineteen fifty [1950], no, 1960 you had to register for the draft and I wasn't gonna go.  And two of my uncles, there were a couple I knew I couldn't whip, I figured I could beat most of them, but there were two I knew who'd kick my ass, and they knew it too.  And they put me in a car and drove me up to the selective service office and stood there and made me register, and made the effort to explain, "You got to find another way to deal with that, but you got to go do this or they'll you know lock you up."  I was angry and I figured that they--I was convinced that the United States military, United States government killed my father and caused his death.
Speaker 2: Do you have any details about where he served or how he served?
Speaker 1: Yes, Germany and France.  He was a hell of a guy.  I found out thirty years ago that I have a sister who I think, who has since died in Lyon [France].  A letter came to the house I was raised in, which was my father's house addressed to James H. Vance, Jr. [James Vance, Jr.].  This came in 1970, '71 [1971], maybe, and it was from a woman, god, whose name I can't remember now in Lyon, who wrote to say that her mother had just died and that they thought he'd want to know.  A couple of my aunts went over to Lyon and met her and it was--she was the offspring of my father and her mother in France, which I guess, made him not all that different from a whole lot of servicemen.  But anyway to answer your question, yes, he was in Germany, he was in France, he was in the--he was infantry, but I can't--I wish I could remember the unit and all of that, but he saw some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So he was actually in a fighting unit?
Speaker 1: He saw some nasty stuff, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think it was--you know what, I have a lot of pictures, Larry [Larry Crowe], and I noticed in those pictures a lot of trucks, and I think he was one of many black guys that they put in the transportation unit, either delivering arms or armaments or troupes, whatever the case is, but he apparently from one of his buddies, I remember George McKnight [ph.], who died years ago, they were together in much of the war and they didn't have a lot of fun over there, and the diving and things from what I'm told were constant explosion of artillery shells and other things, I don't know what the hell it was, but it messed him up, I know that.  So anyway, to answer your question, yes, Germany and France.  From what I'm told he was to get out of the [U.S.] Army, he had enlisted in like 1938 or something like that and was supposed to get out I think in '42 [1942], but come December 7, 1941, which was one month and three days before I was born, in Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii] then everybody--not only did everybody else have to come in, but everybody was already in; you know, forget about mustering out.  So he served, you know, until '45 [1945].
Story_ID: 637238
Speaker 1: Did your father [James Vance, Jr.] have a chance to--did he finish high school, go to college, or?
Speaker 2: He finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never went to college.
Speaker 1: So he went to high school there in Ardmore [Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Same school I went to.
Speaker 1: Was that the Lower Merion [Lower Merion High School]?
Speaker 2: I think there were fourteen or fifteen of the Vances.  I have to look that up.  I ha- there's a book that came out a few years ago.  I think anywhere from twelve to fifteen of us, all who graduated along there in high school, beginning back in 1930 something (laughter).  So they know us there as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did your father have--what was his, what was his ambitions you know when he was coming out of high school, did he want to go to college or did he have a profession.  Did he want to be a plumber like his father [James Vance, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My understanding is that he expected to follow in his father's footsteps.  And from what I'm told, almost felt an obligation to do so, being junior, and that it was important for him to--.  I think my--the sense that I got and from what I recall, my father also greatly respected his father, my grandfather, in much the same way that I did: as a strong upstanding good man whose lead is a good one to follow.  And from what I am told, he--he was a man of good habits before he went to war [World War II, WWII], went to the [U.S.] Army.  And I'm told he didn't smoke and I'm told that he drank very little.  One of my first recollections of my father in that regard was when he came home, he would always work in warm weather with a pack of Camels turned up in his sleeve, you remember guys used to do that, that's where he kept his cigarettes out of the way.  And then like I said, you know, became a total drunk until it finally killed him.  So, as far as I know, to answer your question, yes, his intention was to be a plumber because it was clear it was a good way to take care of your family and to--for a man to do the things that was necessary for a man to do, buy a house, you know.  Like I said he came home from the Army and bought a house right away and went to work every day.  I never lacked--one of the things I point out to people, never in my seventy-two--well forget seventy-two years, but never in those years coming up until I was seventeen did I ever miss a meal or lack for anything that I needed and even most of what I wanted was available to me.  He would give it to me, but they would point the way: "This is how you get that."  So I, I honor them and my father too for seeing to that.
Story_ID: 637239
Speaker 1: You want to address what we were talking about during the break (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you know, as a result of working in the homes of upper middle class and even wealthy people, it was an interesting dynamic working there because we picked up, I mean my uncles, [paternal] grandfather [James Vance, Sr.] and I, noticed a lot of things that were--that they were about that we could employ in our own lives when we came home.  Now we always went back to where we were comfortable, and where we were most comfortable was in our families and in our black community and, you know we went to the black cleaners and the black barbershop and the black lawyers and black doctors and all of that.  But that didn't mean we didn't pick up how people, for example, managed their resources in some of these other nice places.  But something else that occurs to me, we picked up something from them and they picked up some things from us too.  And one of the things that I, and you, thank you, just helped me to recall.  I learned what a dysfunctional family is, really what the definition of a dysfunctional family in the homes of the people whose plumbing needs we were servicing.  Now that's not to say there wasn't plenty of dysfunction in my neighborhood and at home.  But it--and god, I never thought of it before, lot of this dysfunction in my community was born of a lack of things that a number of other people took for granted.  There were a lot of men in my community, who for twenty-seven years, sixteen years, thirty-two years, went to work every day at a job they couldn't stand, who every single day when they got up hated what they had to go do.  That can't help but affect a man, his psyche and every other kind of thing and the consequences of which are felt on his dog, which he'll kick, his kid, which he'll ignore, his wife, which he'll abuse, his self, which he'll not treat well.  But in those houses that we went to every day where people didn't have to worry about those kinds of things, because all their needs were assured.  There was a level of dysfunction, the likes of which--and I'd forgotten all--we used, it was sport for us at the dinner table, and we would talk about how, "Did you see how crazy that little kid was and how he wanted something and his mom said no, and the kid laid down on the floor and started pounding on tables and chairs and his mother said, 'You're gonna get a time out if you keep that up,'" and everybody's laughing 'cause like you do that in my house, you called the undertaker, 'cause you--somebody's gonna, (makes sound) are you gonna suffer.  Anyway, there were things that we picked up that were useful from the people in whose homes we did work that were useful to us in a very positive way, and there were things that we picked up that we knew, if nothing else, we don't ever want to do that, we don't want to be like that.  We don't aspire to that kind of behavior, neglect, and I'm not kidding.  I remember being in a lot of houses where people never even talked to each other, big houses.  They hardly ever saw each other they were so big, so they didn't feel a need to talk to each other.  I remember being in houses from 7:30 in the morning until 5:00 in the afternoon where the only conversations were with the help.  The maid and the children were connected.  Their gardener and the woman of the house, you know, talked because she wanted this, she wanted--but the people themselves, the principals--the husband, the wife, the brother, the sister, if there were other sib- nobody ever talked to each other.  Anyway, there's a lot to be learned from that, and we were, the Vances, weren't the only ones, obviously, you know, who were picking up that kind of information.  You know it's valuable, man, I've heard long, for a long time, it's important to give respect to every encounter that you have with any other human being because even if you don't learn something that you might want to do, if nothing else, you may learn what it is you don't want to do.  And there's value in every connection that you have in that regard.  And it only occurred to me recently in our conversation here how that applied to our work in the homes of people who in the newspapers of the time were glorified and lionized, if you will, as you know the models for American living.  Frankly, in my uncle's words, "They ain't shit," (laughter) is what he would say.  But anyway--
Speaker 1: It's kind of an equalizer when you (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, without a shadow of a doubt.  Very good word, good word, equalizer, you know what I mean.  It's like you walk out and say, well, you know we ain't that bad after all, we're okay (laughter), we're doing okay.  So that was a--
Story_ID: 637240
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about--I know that they lived close to each other.  Is that how your parents final- met and started going together?
Speaker 2: I guess so.  That was kind of a painful story too, Larry [Larry Crowe].  The word I get from my aunts who had no reason to lie to me was that my mother [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance]--my father [James Vance, Jr.] apparently, as a young man, was very desirable 'cause he had a skill, he had manners and you know, he was a good man.  And there were a number of eligible women in the community who would have loved to have made him their mate, their husband, that there were two in particular, and that my mother made a choice to get pregnant 'cause obviously in those days, a woman got pregnant, you got married; I mean there was just no question about it.  And they maintained with conviction that that is how the two of them got married.  Now, I don't know much about their courtship or you know the other mating rituals that were underway at the time.  I read about how black folks intermingled and carried on which seemed to be not that much different than anybody else did at the time.  Why and how and what created whatever level of enmity there was between my father's side of the family, my grandfather [James Vance, Sr.] in particular; and my mother's side, being her father, my grandfather [Joseph Littlejohn], I have no idea.  I always thought it odd, even as a child, that truly their houses abutted each other.  Our backyard abutted his backyard, and I truly do not remember a single day in all my time there that the two of them ever spoke to each other, other than a hello, which back in the--you know, you did that it was proper manners: you speak to somebody even if you can't stand them.  I don't know what the source of that was, and you know what, I never really even thought much about it.
Story_ID: 637241
Speaker 1: I really loved my childhood.  I loved being Little Jimmy [HistoryMaker Jim Vance], which is what they called me, for all of those years, because except for my mother [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance] and my [maternal] grandfather [Joseph Littlejohn], everybody else seemed to be really happy that I was around and treated me--and for a long--for a good number of years, I was the only male grandchild, and as such I was spoiled as much as you know, a kid in that level of life could be spoiled.  Other side of that is, though, my man, expectations were really high.  And I remember there were goodly periods of time where I was mad at those people.  I adore them now, but I was angry.  The last thing I was--I'll give you an example.  For years (gesture) that, any time of day, all day, where an aunt or an uncle, and they were always around, they would (gesture) somebody would do that to me.  The deal was, "Hold your head up boy.  Do not lower your eyes because you do that you don't see the world."  Number one, I remember their saying, all you see is your feet and the ground, you can't learn anything that way.  Number two, you never give anybody any sense that you're defeated or dejected or whatever the case may be.  Number three, you never, ever show any kind of weakness at all, you know, stand up and keep your head up.  I used to hate 'em (laughter).  I wanted to punch them when they did that to me.  But after a while, you don't do this anymore because it's important you know to--"Okay, whatever you want."  That was important to them that I meet, greet, meet, deal with the world and life with a sense of self in pride and whatever else the case may be, and I give them so much credit for that.  Now it also had a downside.  I was--B's were not good in grades.  But whatever ball I was playing you expected to start.  The job that I would go to you expected to do this job well.  You asked me earlier about a favorite expression or something like that and I really have so many which is why I said, no.  One of them among them, and my grandfather--good enough ain't never.  He meant that, he lived by that good enough ain't never good enough, or is never acceptable as far as he was concerned.  And so those kinds of expectations and demands put a lot of pressure on a kid and 'cause I didn't always feel up to it.  Of course, when I grew up, you know I couldn't thank them more for raising the bar, but the bar was always held very, very high, and I was expected to (cough) meet it.
Story_ID: 637242
Speaker 1: Considering what--I think we already kind of know the answer here, but considering all the influences around you, we generally ask if, you know, who you think you take after the most, your mother or your father, but in this case your father [James Vance, Jr.] died kind of early and your mother [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance] was kind of distant.  And I guess your [paternal] grandfather [James Vance, Sr.] was a major influence, I suppose, but do you think you took anything after your mother and father, your looks, the way you walk, you talk, your sense of humor, anything?
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  And the reason I just smiled is because only this year, a friend of mine said to me, "You have blue eyes," at which I almost choked.  I was eating dinner.  I said, "What in the hell are you talking about?"  And she said, "There's blue in your eyes."  Nobody had ever said that to me before.  And when I went to look, I went to the bathroom right away (laughter).  See I didn't want, I didn't want blue eyes, and I went to the bath- and there is, I don't know if it's every now and again, 'cause I, you know, I did that--well I haven't looked since, maybe I should, but there was this blue in there.  So, in answer to your question, yes, that apparently came from my mother.  I look like, from what I am told by everybody in the family, the perfect combination, the perfect cross, perfect blend of each of them.  My nose is definitely my father, my lips I'm told, I'm told are my mother, you know I don't know.  My--but pretty much everything else about me I give credit to my grandfather, except my height and my size.  My grandfather is like 5'6", if that.  I've been 6'2" since I was sixteen or seventeen, and so I have no idea where that came from.  Again, I'm assuming, you know, maybe there were Vikings (laughter) on my mother's side or something.  Or where did people--the Dutch who were--tend to be large stature, but I have absolutely no idea.  But in terms of character, in terms of the basic ingredients that form a man, most of those I give credit to my grandfather.

Speaker 1: Now you've, you've given a lot of this answer already within the context of what we've been talking about, but we always ask--well, well I'll ask another question first.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?  An earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's wonderful.  And it truly is one of my earliest memories I had--well no, he might have come up--anyway, as a little kid, the memory is--the memory is of walking two blocks from my house to my [paternal] grandparents' [Elizabeth Vance and James Vance, Sr.] house on Christmas morning, cold, but crisp and clear with a drum slung over my shoulders, beating the drum as my father is marching down the street.  I'm providing the cadence and he is--and he marched impressively, in my view.  I don't know if I've ever seen anybody march like him.  But when I changed cadence, he would change, I mean, I was in control, and he let me be in control.  And like I said, I never felt more love than when I would sit on my grandfather on the porch without speaking, I don't know that I ever felt more connected with somebody than I was with my father on that particular day.  And interesting you asked me that because my first memory, my first--well, the first thing I can remember being on this earth that (claps hands) immediately comes to mind and sticks out as it does is that moment.  And I think that ain't bad.  I have a few friends with whom I've talked a lot over the years and theirs is not that.  One of my main boys was Ed Bradley who died a few years back, and it just occurred to me in a conversation that I had with him about that kind of thing, and it wasn't the very first, but what were (unclear), and his wasn't as pleasant, but even then, mine was marching down the street.  They called him Big Jimmy [James Vance, Sr.] and they called me Little Jimmy [HistoryMaker Jim Vance].  But marching down the street, Little Jimmy beating the drum, Big Jimmy marching in step, and I'm happy that that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. So--
Speaker 2: --that's the first one.
Story_ID: 637244
Speaker 1: Your neighborhood--I was--is Ardmore [Pennsylvania] by definition a black community, or?
Speaker 2: No.  By definition it's a white community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There is a pocket where the--where we lived (laughter).  But you know what, let me make this point very quickly, if I can.  When I was a little child up until I was, I don't know, maybe seven years old, so I guess that would take me to '49 [1949]), I lived in what I'd like to call a mini United Nations because it was all tradesmen and blue collar.  You know there was a time when a lot of women were either home or working in other homes not far away (mumbling) anyway.  And among my earlier memories, not the first, but among my earlier memories in elementary school [Ardmore Avenue School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania], we're coming home, cause I walked this, I don't know, ten blocks away, I knew when I was getting near my house because of the aromas that filled the air and the aromas ran the gamut, it was a, not an epicurean (unclear)--whatever.  There were the Zachetis [ph.] across the street, there were the Murphys [ph.]--Zachetis were Italian, they were bricklayers, the Murphys were right over here, they were carpenters, the Jagmozacks [ph.] which were what, Hungarian or whatever, were pipefitters or whatever, anyway there was all these people, there was a Hungarian family and coming home somebody was cooking dinner, starting dinner at three, four o'clock in the afternoon for the men that would be coming home at five or six o'clock, and oh, my god, there was the garlic over here and there was the potatoes cooking here and there was the goulash over here.  It was wonderful.  And in those days, I was (gesture) that big--you were welcomed in everybody's house, and like I said, nobody ever locked the door, so you would just walk in and there's, "Oh, Little Jimmy [HistoryMaker Jim Vance], here take a--taste this, see what you like."  And, or they say, "You liked that?  Sit down, eat," you know?  And like, okay.  But anyway (laughter), I hadn't thought of that in many, many years.  But it was a wonderful experience, but getting back to your question, it was a white community with its service pocket, and my part of Ardmore was the service pocket.  And like I said, my high school [Lower Merion High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania] was mostly white, and like I said, we did not mix and we did not intermingle in terms of visiting each other's homes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So was there a name for the black pocket of Ardmore?
Speaker 2: No, no name.  Like you know a lot of places, what was it in Cleveland [Ohio], my wife [Kathy McCampbell Vance] is from Cleveland, I forget.  She was born, what is it called, it won't come to me now, but--huh?
Speaker 1: Was it Hough [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Hou- well, Hough was one, but there was--
Speaker 1: It was another one?
Speaker 2: Some- but anyway, they eventually moved to Shaker.
Speaker 1: Shaker Heights [Ohio].
Speaker 2: And you know, all of a sudden, they're uptown folks now, you know what I mean.  And you know in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] there's the Bottom [Black Bottom, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and there's this that and the other, but no, it was not--there's no name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Except over there where black folks lived.
Speaker 1: Just kind of like--is there a main street that ran through?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, through my part of town you had a main street was Spring Avenue, it's where--man things (unclear).  I will never not think of Spring Avenue as the street where the guys from North Philly [North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] came down in a 1955 Mercury and out of the back windows, guy put the window down and started firing a shot gun, it's the first drive by that I remember.  I was what, fifteen, sixteen years old.
Speaker 1: Did they shoot somebody?
Speaker 2: They were trying to shoot somebody.  They were mad 'cause you know--right after they left, we jumped in the car and went to North Philly looking for them.  And thank god we didn't find them.  But anyway, yes, Spring Avenue was the main street through town, but that's, that's--(laughter) it's a shame but that's what I think of when I think of Spring Avenue.
Story_ID: 637245
Speaker 1: What was it like, I mean what was the black community like, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up there?
Speaker 2: It was tight, tight community.  Everybody knew everybody else.  It was not unlike, I think, as from what I've learned and read, any black community anywhere in America.  And it was in fact, also, quite self contained to some degree.  Everybody, when you wanted to rent or buy a house, you bought or rented from oh, god, I can't remember his name, a black realtor, there was a black tailor, there was a black cleaners, Mr.--forget his name.  When you wanted any appliance, there weren't that many, but your TV, you remember the TV tubes and all that kind of stuff, you wanted your radio fixed, your television, your, I don't know, your washing machine, you called a guy called Chick [ph.].  Anyway, everything we needed was within three or four blocks.  The doctor was Dr. Jones [ph.] over there, the mortician was Mr. Minus.  It was not unlike what I hear and read about neighborhoods in Chicago [Illinois], certainly neighborhoods I knew about in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Atlanta [Georgia], L.A. [Los Angeles, California], Bo-; everywhere that I've ever talked to people.  I don't remember ever feeling deprived of anything as a child.  I knew that in other parts of for example, Ardmore [Pennsylvania], there were better or more--there were larger dry cleaners, there were more elegant doctors' offices and you know all those kinds of things like that.  But I don't remember ours being inadequate.  I don't remember ever feeling lacking or needing anything.  Now, all of that, of course now is gone.  But when I graduated high school [Lower Merion High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania] in 1959 and left to go to school [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania], it was all still there for the most part.
Speaker 1: Was there an entertainment district there?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: That we did not have.  So funny you asked that because I spoke at a Boys and Girls Club I think the last week, and I was talking about how much I admire the Boys and Girls Club in part because they didn't have one.  Now we had Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], but there was no Boys and Girls Clubs [Boys and Girls Clubs of America], the--we weren't welcomed at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] when they finally built the Y.
Speaker 1: There was no black Y, right?
Speaker 2: No, there was no black Y.  And so, all, all activity for kids happened at the playground.  We did have our own--it wasn't supposed to be, but it became our playground 'cause they built a bigger better one for the white kids, you know, further up the street.  But everything happened there, and all enter- well most entertainment, you went to Philly, which was only four or five miles away.  But there was Charlie Whiting's bar [ph.] on the corner of Simpson Road and Spring Avenue and there was the Cotton Club [Cotton Club of Ardmore, Ardmore, Pennsylvania] right up on Simpson Road, two block up from where my house was.  Have you ever been in a black town anywhere in America where there wasn't a Cotton Club?  Well, we had one too.  And talk about entertainment, part of the entertainment was on Friday and Saturday night sitting up on the stoop outside the supermarket there, well sort of a supermarket, and wat- or looking at the clocks or watches to see when the fight was going to start, and who was going to get cut and who was going to be running from chasing somebody; normal activity of people who don't have much in the way of material things, but are not lacking passion.  And the people in Ardmore, in my part of town, had an abundance of passion.  And also an eagerness to do something to justify, not justify their existence, but to do something to make themselves feel better from whatever the drudgery of their life was.  And often it took harmful forms or, you know, forms that were not good for themselves, or for anybody else, inappropriate, if you will.  And most of them, on Sunday morning, you'd see them in church.
Story_ID: 637246
Speaker 1: What was the church experience when you were growing up, did you (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were three churches, three black churches.  (Laughter) All--isn't that always the case, also: there's always a congregation of churches.  Three black churches, we were A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] and there were two Baptist churches.  A.M.E. was here, one black church here, I mean, the A.M.E.--our church and a black Baptist church was in the same block, and then three blocks over was another Baptist church.   And we didn't like each other.  It's always been a mystery to me why there was no intermingling connection of any kind between Bethel and Mount Calvary [Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Ardmore, Pennsylvania] and Zion [Zion Baptist Church of Ardmore, Ardmore, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: So, Bethel was A.M.E?
Speaker 2: Bethel A.M.E. [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Ardmore, Pennsylvania]
Speaker 1: That's your family church?
Speaker 2: That's my family church, which my great-grandmother--of which my great-grandmother was one of the founders, which my family was always so very proud of.  But, yes, the church was huge in that community and had a big influence over--big influence over what?  We always--everybody acted like it mattered, the church, and being there and being associated with it.  But we didn't always behave like it really mattered, do you know what I mean?  'Cause you'd still--same guy that you'd see putting an excessive amount of money, like two dollars, which was a lot of money, in the plate on Sunday morning, that's the guy who was trying to cut, you know, Jimmy Johnson [ph.] the night before, you know, trying to make up for it.  It was--I don't know, I think of it now just a lot of hypocrisy and a lot of bullshit, but it seemed to work, you know.  For--and who am I, again, who am I to judge it.  Folks got along pretty well with that.
Story_ID: 637247
Speaker 1: Now did, did church have a--you know from what you're saying, it didn't have a big effect on you in terms of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --your--
Speaker 2: Well, may I explain that?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: It might have except for what happened one Sunday when I was, I think, fourteen years old.  Like every other kid in Ardmore [Pennsylvania], my parents [Eleanor Littlejohn Vance and James Vance, Jr.] and family insisted that we go to church from the time I can remember, Sunday school.  And because I could sing, I remember so well, the sunbeam choir, junior choir and then the gospel chorus and then the concert choir, there were like five different--and I was in all of them as I got older.  Bible school every summer, Sunday school every Sunday morning, and on and on and on.  One day when I was fourteen, I went to church [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Ardmore, Pennsylvania] and the minister is a relatively new guy.  God I'll never forget this like it was yesterday.  He stood up in that pulpit and he started reading off a list of names of people who were no longer in good standing with the church because they had not paid dues in at least a year, year or more.  And I know what he was trying to say and everything, but I--and I--god, it's like yesterday.  I sat there thinking, wait a minute this dude is declaring publicly that these people are no longer in good standing with God 'cause they didn't pay him some money.  And I got up and I walked out; I've never been back.  Then when I got home, my [paternal] grandfather [James Vance, Sr.] was home who was as deeply spiritual a man as I have ever known in my life.  But in all of my life, I never saw him set foot in that church.  Everybody else went, my mother, all the kids, his--my uncles and aunts, he'd be alone (unclear).  I went home, he never said a word.  My aunts came home and they were on me something horrible: "Why'd you walk out of church like that, you embarrassed us," and that whole kind of thing.  And this is one of the times I remember my grandfather's power, when he said with a deep voice, "Leave that boy alone," and everybody immediately stopped, 'cause he didn't have to say, but everybody got it.  He got it.  We never talked about it, but I never had any doubt in my mind that my grandfather, when I walked in that house kind of like, I expected you to be here and I expected that to happen, and you don't have to explain anything 'cause I get it.  But anyway, go back to your que- it, the church had a tremendous influence on my life until I was fourteen years old, and I spent a good deal of my free time in church related activities.  At that point, when I stepped away, I stepped far away.  Never lost faith in a higher power, but never ever again felt a need to identify with any particular religion.  Soon after that went to college [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania] about six years later--about four years later.  And one of the first courses I had I remember was comparative religion, at which point I learned all the things that had been done in the name of somebody's god.  Which was just like confirmation of my act at fourteen years old, so.  Forgive me for taking so long, but yes, church, tremendous influence.  And I don't regret that influence up until that point.  I'm grateful for lessons learned and bible verses and the attempt to instill an ethic and a matter of discipline and what's the word I'm looking for, but of observance of some force greater than me.  I'm grateful for all of that, but it stops right there.
Speaker 1: Did the church afford you opportunities, you know leadership opportunities or--you're well spoken, I mean you've made a career out of being a well spoken man, did you have opportunities as a youth to, you know, did they put you out front to do different things?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My only encouragement of any kind was in vocal, in choirs--
Speaker 1: Singing, okay.
Speaker 2: --and that kind of thing.  But other than that, no, we didn't have--a lot of people these days think of the black church and they think of the tremendous political influence that it had and sociological implications as a black church.  Most (unclear) cuch of it in the '60s [1960s] forward as it regards Civil Rights Movement and those other things, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth] and Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy], all those guys.  That wasn't my church, my church was more country church, and they were more biblical than political and there was not--there weren't a lot of program efforts in my--.  You know, it was a very poor church, come to think of it, to put it that way.  It wasn't a lot of resources at all in that church, and people worked so hard just to put food on the table that they really didn't have a lot left to create a youth mentor program, for example.  All the kinds of things that are so common now, as they should be, in black churches today, but none of that existed in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] when I was in church.  But what there was, like I said, I'm grateful for--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) up to that point.
Story_ID: 637248
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?
Speaker 2: The school district in Lower Merion Township [Lower Merion School District], which were, I remember reading several times considered among the finest schools in the entire country, finest public schools.  And I am very grateful for the advantage that I had in that regard.  Let me say when I was in school, it was the old track system: you had general education, what they call distributive education and academic course.  I was in the academic curriculum all the way through high school [Lower Merion High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania], not because I wanted to be, again, it's my family, you know, this is what you'll do.  And as such I was the only black boy.  There was one other--there were two of us in academic, the other was a girl.  I remember my counselor in my senior year almost discouraging me--actively discouraging me from going to college.  Now what she didn't know, I didn't want to go to college anyhow, I wanted to be a plumber.  That's a whole 'nother story.  But, and I didn't even think about it cause I didn't care.  But I tho- thinking about it later, what a despicable person that was, but that's how they rolled back then, white counselors.
Speaker 1: Now this is such a typical story.  We must have a hundred of these or hundreds of these stories, counseling stories.  But what did your counselors tell you specifically, just that you shouldn't--
Speaker 2: That I would be so much better off and would find so much more--it would be so much easier, I don't know if they said on me and for me, but they may have, if I just go ahead and you know work in the family business [James H. Vance and Sons], how wonderful it is to have a business, you know, that you can just step right on up into.  I get even an- a little bit angry now thinking about that.  But even before that, I am so grateful for the quality of education that was available to me.  I am not so grateful for the quality of the social consciousness of many--too many of the teachers that I had who were not--did not embrace me, who were not encouraging.  I am grateful for the fact that I was not consciously angry at them, but I do give them credit for in some way inspiring me to succeed at a certain level in spite of them.  I had a physics teacher, never forget this, who blew a dog whistle one time in class.  I forget what they, what we were studying, but something probably about audio.  Anyway, I could swear I heard this thing, and one of the biggest mistakes I made was saying, "I think I hear that," and I remember him laughing and saying something about lower forms of animals that respond to different stimuli clearly.  I mean he said it, you know, with elegant hatred, is what I'm a call it.
Speaker 1: Well the implication was that you could hear something that they couldn't hear because you're a (unclear), right?
Speaker 2: I'm a lower form.
Speaker 1: A lower form than them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.  That's what he said.  He didn't couch it all that well.  I'm saying you know he didn't get down into the gutter with his language, but you know, it's exactly what he said and it's exactly what he meant, and to this day, that was in 1958, and I can still see his eyes today, and that man despised me.  And at that moment, quite frankly, I despised him.  But anyway, that's what the nature of, except for and I have to--there was a woman named Ms. Fowler, who I know is in heaven.  I think Ms. Fowler was an angel that God put down here just for a few years to help out people like me because she knew what was going on, and she would not allow me to fail.  She was so encouraging and so supportive and so, so eager to help me to see potential that I had no idea was there.  She was my English teacher.
Speaker 1: At what level?
Speaker 2: This was at--from tenth grade--I had Ms. Fowler one way or another from tenth grade through twelfth grade, and she--I will bless her name for all my time on earth because those other guys, and mostly are all men, they could have turned me off to the joy of learning and to the incredible wonderfulness of education.  She refused to allow that to happen, and I am so grateful.  She is the one who caused me to recognize what wonderful things could happen if I were to continue reading.  Now the fact of the matter is I was one of the guys, when I showed up on a basketball court, I almost always had a Mickey Spillane book in my back pocket.  I loved me some Mickey Spillane.
Speaker 1: 'Mike Hammer.'
Speaker 2: And that's, that was my man.  You know what I'm talking about.  And I had--I always carried a book of one kind or another, usually a crime novel.  I knew Dashiell Hammett you know when I was--before I could drive.  But anyway, she encouraged me to you know look beyond the crime genre and into other kinds of things and--anyway, I will bless her for all time, so--
Story_ID: 637249
Speaker 1: Lower Merion was very useful to me--I have to tell you something, Lower Merion was also one of the worst things that happened to me when I got to Cheyney [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania], because when I did finally go to Cheyney, let me say, I didn't want to go to college, I wanted to be a plumber, I loved plumbing work, but my aunt Vivi [Vivian Vance], that 102 year old saint who's still kicking--
Speaker 2: Now she's your--
Speaker 1: My aunt.
Speaker 2: She's--but your--
Speaker 1: On my father's [James Vance, Jr.] side.
Speaker 2: --your grandfather's sister, or your?
Speaker 1: My grandfather's daughter.
Speaker 2: Daughter, right (unclear).
Speaker 1: She's my father's sister.  But Aunt Vivi, talk about heroes at fifty-four, got tired of cleaning people's houses and other things, she also did hair in her back room.  And I still remember the smell of them--curling iron burning that hair.  At fifty-four she decided she didn't want to clean anymore houses, she enrolled at Cheyney, graduated and taught.  Was a celebrated teacher for twenty-five, thirty years after that.  She convinced me that I had to go to school if only to see what else is possible, I remember her saying to me.  When I got to Cheyney, my first year, they kicked me out of school, because I would show up only for the test and turn in the papers, because all the course work I had already had in high school.
Speaker 2: Now, let me back up just a little bit, just for the record, what was the name of your grade school in Lower Merion?
Speaker 1: Great, Ardmore elementary school [Ardmore Avenue School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania], which is (unclear).
Speaker 2: Ardmore, okay.
Speaker 1: And then Ardmore Junior High [Ardmore Junior High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then Lower Merion High School [Ardmore, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So Ardmore--okay.
Speaker 1: Ardmore elementary, Ardmore Junior High and then Lower Merion High School.  But they were--there was wonderful curriculum, especially in the academic 'cause--
Speaker 2: And before we get you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know to Cheyney again, now you were, you played sports at--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Lower Merion?
Speaker 1: Football and track, right.
Speaker 2: Football and track.
Speaker 1: Football and track.
Speaker 2: No basketball?
Speaker 1: Nah.  You want to know why?  I have a condition called ichthyosis  vulgaris, I think it's called.  My skin, you can't see it now so much, but certain parts of my--especially my legs.  The cells on your skin are flaking right now, billions of them, as are everybody else's.  Mine don't flake into the air as they supposed to and kind of dense up and pile up, and as a result, it can look like, kind of like, you know, alligator whatever.  But it needs great deal of lubrication.  I was embarrassed because in the summertime, for whatever reason, it almost disappears, but in the wintertime, it comes back hard and they knew nothing back in those days.  In basketball you gotta wear shorts, man, and I just couldn't do it.  All my basketball was on the playground court.  But I couldn't play organized ball 'cause I couldn't go out in front of them girls with my legs looking like they do.
Speaker 2: In the wintertime, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But you could run track though, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because track was spring.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You were getting into warm weather and sunny whatever and so it wasn't as bad, plus the fact not many people came to track meets.  Everybody goes to basketball game.  And they're all around you, and you know there you are.  On a track meet, you know you got the short distance here, long distance, you know you got all this spread area so people are--you're not so much the focus as you are in a basketball arena.
Speaker 2: At some point somebody made fun of you, or something (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Oh, god, from the time I was a child with short pants 'cause I also had--something was wrong with my feet.  You know today put a board and put a child's shoe and nail them to the board.  I used to sleep with my feet in a board 'cause they had to break them and straighten them or whatever.  So I had, wore what you called orthopedic shoes.  I didn't have my first pair of loafers until I was nineteen years old 'cause I couldn't wear--I had to wear orthopedic shoes.  With orthopedic shoes and short pants, which you know all the kids had to wear, I caught the blues.  I learned how to knock people out because my skin was so bad 'cause I was always in a fight 'cause somebody was always laughing at me.  It was terrible, man you know (laughter).  I mean I laugh at it now.  It was awful back when I was a little child and I learned to cover up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But anyway that was always a problem.  I forgot where we were.  Anyways, that's why I didn't play basketball (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.  Let's talk about--
Story_ID: 637250
Speaker 1: Growing up did you, did you watch the news?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Always interested in what was going on.  Loved me some--Swanson, what was his name?  Remember the 'Camel Caravan' ['Camel News Caravan']?
Speaker 1: Douglas Edwards.
Speaker 2: Douglas Edwards, and then there was this guy named Swanson also.
Speaker 1: The guy that used to do the Timex watches?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: John Cameron Swayze.
Speaker 2: John Cameron Swayze, not Swanson, Swayze, that's it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew who you were--
Speaker 2: I listened even to that fool, "(Makes sounds), Good evening, Mr. and Ms. America--and all the ships at sea."
Speaker 1: Walter Winchell.
Speaker 2: Walter Winchell.  Dang, you a old dude, ain't you?   (Laughter) All of those guys.  I admired them and listened very--Kaltenback, Kaltenheimer--
Speaker 1: I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Kalten-whatever.
Speaker 1: A.P. Kalten-something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was with--
Speaker 1: Kaltenborn [H.V. Kaltenborn], Kaltenborn.
Speaker 2: Kaltenborn, yeah, thank you.
Speaker 1: Kaltenborn, yeah.
Speaker 2: But he was part of that cabal with--with Cronkite [Walter Cronkite], Ed (unclear), what's his name, Murrow [Edward R. Murrow].  Remember the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) Murrow, the--yeah the smoke-
Speaker 2: See it live where he sat up there and smoked a cigarette and do the thing--live interviews, not live, but interviews with people.  Anyway, I'm sorry it just got too nostalgic, didn't it?  Yes, I did.  I cared about the news very much, always read the paper.  Back then we had three daily newspapers: we had the Daily News [Philadelphia Daily News], The Philadelphia Inquirer, which was the morning paper, the Daily News came out about noon and then the evening Bulletin [Philadelphia Bulletin], which came out in the evening.
Speaker 1: So three editions would come to your house?
Speaker 2: Three editions, every day.  That's how--well, you know, hell, in New York [New York], there have what, four or five of them that came out every day.  But yeah, in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] there were three newspapers.  Jet magazines all over the house in every other kind of way, loved Jet.  Ebony was huge.  But also, I was a fan of Time magazine, Look and Life, Look and Life magazine, Saturday Evening Post was huge in my house.  So all those things were--had appeal to me, and I'm not sure--well, I am sure (mumbling).  My people, my aunts and uncles, they hungered for information.
Speaker 1: I remember my [paternal] grandmother [Elizabeth Vance] would bring back like the Mickey Spillane books and all that sort of thing from the white people's homes.
Speaker 2: There you go, yeah.
Speaker 1: All that kind of stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Right.  "Here, boy, read this."  Uh-huh, that and that was in my house too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Reader's Digest, all kind of stuff.
Speaker 2: There you go, Reader's Digest, absolutely.  And you know what? The Reader's Digest came from my aunts who bought them home.  I hadn't--god, I hadn't thought about that in years.  We didn't subscribe to Reader's Digest because they got them from the houses where they did laundry or cleaned the houses or whatever case there may be, and they brought them.  National Geographic, they brought National Geographic home as well.  But anyway, reading had great value in my house.  And there was, oh my god, between the dining room and the living room, both of which were about as wide as this, but there's this little wall and in that wall it was a library with shelves, about that wide (gesture).  And books that one aunt or unc- an uncle or another would make me the--I remember the Egyptian and I can't remember the author's name.  'Ivanhoe' [Walter Scott], I remember that one, Faulk- Faulkner [William Faulkner], one of Faulkner's books and also the guy on the West Coast, who, I can't remember the name.  But anyway, the guy who wrote about Monterey, California and all up in there.
Speaker 1: 'The Grapes of Wrath' and all that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Steinbeck [John Steinbeck]?
Speaker 2: Whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At different times, different uncles or aunts, somebody would finish a book and then say, "Here, read this."  And I didn't want to read this.  This was back when I was twelve--eleven, twelve years old.  "Read this and tell me about it."  And that would be part of my thing.  "Tell me about that book when you're done."  In other words, don't BS me; read the book and be prepared to--I was doing book reports when I was twelve (laughter).  But anyway reading was very, very important and I--god am I so very grateful to them for that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So sixteen aunts and uncles supplying you with reading materials?
Speaker 2: All the time.
Story_ID: 637251
Speaker 1: All the time and (gesture) you know, pride and poise and oh, erudition, elegance.  In my house there was no ain't.  Now I could go out in the street, you know, I get down with the best of them.  In that house, it had to be isn't.  And there had to be the diphthong, the final T and the D and the--it had to, you had to hear the T pop at the end of wouldn't, that kind of thing.  I hated them for that, but I'm so grateful to them now for that kind of thing, so.  That kind of stuff was important.  Interestingly though, you know what just occurred to me, nobody ever checked my homework.  And I had--this is rigorous academic course.  And I could do homework, it wasn't unusual, for hours.  'Cause I had, these are prac- I did run indoor track as well, during the basketball season, so I never got home before six or seven o'clock.  But I would be up at midnight, you know, trying to get homework done.  Nobody--I can n- ever remember anybody checking my homework.  It was assumed that I would do it, and that I would get it done.
Speaker 2: How were your grades?
Speaker 1: Mediocre.  They were okay.  And when I say they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) academic track?
Speaker 1: Right.  And when I say okay, elementary school [Ardmore Avenue School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania], they had to be A's.  Junior high school [Ardmore Junior High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania] they let up a little bit and I could come home with a B.  But high school [Lower Merion High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania], which was '56 [1956] to '59 [1959] everybody had something going on in the family.  Lot--several of them had died, but there was a lot of drama and they lightened up on me in part though 'cause they had never felt--I don't think they every felt that they had to keep the hammer down so hard.  I--by then I got it and it was important to get certain things done in a certain kind of way.  But that was also the time that a bit of rebelliousness, you know, came up.
Story_ID: 637252
Speaker 1: Got locked up you know, once or twice, just stupid stuff, kid stuff.  And by locked up, I mean like for a couple of hours.  I don't mean for any period of time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: For doing--
Speaker 2: For instance, what?
Speaker 1: Went around the corner one day, my boys were all excited, what's up, some kids from--Haverford College [Haverford, Pennsylvania] was right on the edge of my community, an upscale, very liberal arts school.  And the story was that one of, one of our kids, not one of the guys we ran with, but that some of the college kids had beaten him up and we're gonna go get him and anyway, I went and got my uncle's 1947 Plymouth, I remember, with the steer- stick on the steering column.  And we started riding around looking for basically, some white boy to beat up.  They found one.  I didn't get out.  Couple of guys got out, jacked him up, jumped back in the car, decided to go just ride around and play, turned out to be the police chief's son that they jumped out on.  Forty-five minutes later, cops all around, they took us to jail.  I was with five guys.  All five said I had picked them up after the fact; that I had nothing to do with it.  I swear I hadn't thought about this in fifty years.  I don't know why they did that, but they all--all (mumbling) five of them all said he wasn't there, he picked us up after they jacked the guy up.
Speaker 2: They were looking out for you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I mean did they have a sense that you were the only one on the academic track?
Speaker 1: Oh, they knew I was the only one on the academic track.  I don't know if they knew I was the only one who might--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) so they saw the importance of that.
Speaker 1: --who might do something else.  I don't know.  God I--I don't know where any of them are now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It makes you think that they may have--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --a sense of that?
Speaker 1: You know they, they--they knew something.  I don't know what they knew, you know.
Story_ID: 637253
Speaker 1: One of the things I'm most grateful for in my life, is I have been blessed to have people in my life who saw things--who have always seen things that I--that I was late seeing, or felt a worthiness that I was late picking up on.  I have been blessed with people who wouldn't let me fail.  When we ever get to the college thing, I'll tell you about a couple of them that--
Speaker 2: Well, we can go to college--
Speaker 1: --I endure.
Speaker 2: --I just want to--I always ask people, like what were your aspirations at the time of high school graduation?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Time of high school graduation, my aspiration was to be a plumber.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When I graduated high school [Lower Merion High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania], I wanted to work with my [paternal] grandfather [James Vance, Sr.] and my uncles because I loved that work.  I figured out why years later when I was a teacher.  And what I figured out was at the, at the end of a day what a trade craftsman--the gift that a trade craftsman has that lawyers don't necessarily have, doctors may have it, but so many other professions don't have, he walks in to a task in the morning and he sees what's before him.  At the end of the day, a work day, a trade craftsman can turn around, that is my labor today.  That's the fruit of my labor, that's the product of my effort today.  And there is something ennobling about that, that on a daily basis, a trades craftsman can measure his work, or at least as it regards his labor, which is for most of us, much of our lives.  And there's an invalue in that that I never recognized, I'm not sure many others did either.  But that is in part, I think, one of the reasons that drew me to wanting to be a plumber.  It, like I said, didn't happen because my aunt Vivi [Vivian Vance] convinced me.  She had just graduated from Cheyney [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania] at sixty.  "You need to go to college, boy."  And so I did.
Story_ID: 637254
Speaker 1: Cheney State [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania], talked into going by your aunt Vivi [Vivian Vance], and--who has a remarkable story. She got her degree and went on to teach--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know.  So she's sixty years old and been out there about eight years, I guess when she?
Speaker 2: Well, she just graduated.
Speaker 1: She just graduated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, at sixty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm sorry, probably fifty-eight or something, just before sixty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And convinced me that I needed to go to college, and so I did.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Cheyney State, what, you know, first?
Speaker 2: Sometimes, you know, what's that thing about a either a blind dog will find--a blind squirrel will find a nut every now and again.  I am so blessed to have gone to Cheyney.  I think I mentioned my high school [Lower Merion High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania] was mostly white.  I lived in a black community, but a lot of my intermingling, both in terms of athletics and choral things and stuff like that was in a white world.  Cheyney was my first experience in an all-black environment.  There was one white guy at Cheyney when I was there, he came late, very small so therefore intimate.  I think there were seven hundred students at most.  But the biggest asset was probably a product of segregation.  The level and the competence of the faculty at Cheyney, I to this day consider to be excellent without exception.  They were at Cheyney because they would not allow them at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] or you know name any other institution, but it wasn't because of a lack of either credentials and/or skills.  I found at Cheyney direction, I found discipline, I found guidance, I found enlightenment.  I found a light and a reason to be more than hopeful and more than positive and more than objective.  Cheyney was a gift, man.  I mentioned Mrs. Fowler in high school who was terribly instrumental in my educational growth.  There is a man whose name I will honor and revere at least as much as hers, maybe not even more, Dr. James Oliver.  I was an English major.  Dr. Oliver was my professor in a number of, couple of different courses in the course of that.  I never knew--I have never in my life known a gentler, kinder, more brilliant, more committed man than Dr. Oliver.  And I have made this point before, and I will make it 'til the day I die, Dr. Oliver would not let me fail no matter how hard I tried.  I was a knucklehead at Cheyney as, you know, been most of my life.  But Dr. Oliver--Dr. Oliver never talked to the knucklehead; he always talked to the potential scholar, the potential achiever in me.  He talked to a person I didn't even know existed.  But he knew it, and I honor that man in ways that I have trouble finding words to, to explain.
Story_ID: 637255
Speaker 1: Also at Cheyney [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania], that's where I ran into Ed Bradley and Ted Nickens and Kenny Hamilton [ph.] and Wendell Whitlock and Lionel Horton [ph.], you know, names go on and on and on, men most of whom were the first in their families to ever go beyond high school.  Men who developed to be men of character and accomplishment and honor, integrity and achievement; just really significant contributors to the entire American fabric, and they were my boys, and we discovered things together, and we made mistakes together, and we supported each other in ways that I didn't really know that people did for each other.  I discovered--I found my blackness at Cheyney, and I don't mean that as a thing to single me out, but rather a thing to enlarge me and give me a worldview, even, if you will.
Speaker 2: So what does that entail?  I mean that, you should--yeah, just kind of--
Speaker 1: In my pocket of Ardmore [Pennsylvania], which was all black, I discovered as I noted before--not discovered, but I found a lot of people who were prideful, who were honest and who had dignity and who were determined to achieve and overcome as best they possibly could.  There is also a lot of pathology in that community, as I mentioned.  There was cutting and cheating, not so much shooting, but a lot of cutting and a lot of things that were not brotherly at all, and that did not, and would not allow that community to grow, and it didn't grow.  I mean, the best of Ardmore was 1956, maybe, and you know then the slow decline.  At Cheyney, and what I mean by when I discovered my blackness, I discovered all of those positive elements before and others that allowed, not only allowed, but insisted on growth.  And perhaps the best way to put it, I never tried to put this in words, the way the blackness defined itself was in brotherhood and what that really means, and what power that--came from that.
Story_ID: 637256
Speaker 1: We were young and stupid and for the most part ignorant.  I remember our football coach, Coach Stevenson [James Stevenson] was a huge fan of Toussaint Louverture.  None of us had ever heard of Toussaint Louverture when we went to college, because nobody even, in any of the schools, they went to mostly black schools in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I went to that mostly white school [Lower Merion High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania], nobody had ever taught us anything about Toussaint Louverture.  The point of that being the reason that Coach Stevenson found that particular piece of history so important was because he needed it, or he felt it necessary for us to appreciate what people of color can do when they act cohesively and that there are--were and are and will always be people of color who are significant beyond the norm, and who need to be recognized.  You need to know who they are because like Aunt Vivi [Vivian Vance] was saying in a different sense, this is what's possible, you can change a nation.
Speaker 2: Of all the historical figures, why do you think he focused on Toussaint?  What's Toussaint's contribution?
Speaker 1: Toussaint was a slave who refused servitude.  Toussaint was a man from the humblest that we can't even imagine of beginnings who took an empire to its knees.  France almost went broke trying to deal with him in Haiti because they were als- they had the British over here and they  had what--but they had to deal with this problem because of the--and here's the other element of it, find the money, because everything, it gets back to the dollar.  Go to slavery, go to the industrial area, whatever it is you want to talk about, find the value and forget cherchez la femme and all, find the dollar.  And in Haiti, the sugar and the tobacco and the--whatever I was going to say, I can't remember it all we're getting out of there, Toussaint Louverture represented all the things that matter in the--not, I started to say modern, intercourse of business and commerce and finance and politics and every other kind of thing, but not just modern but from going back to all, to the very beginning.  And Toussaint, I don't remember it all, but to answer your question, Toussaint Louverture had character, Toussaint Louverture had integrity.  He never--he never dropped a dime on anybody.  There were more than one, more than a couple of occasions where Napoleon [Napoleon Bonaparte] and a couple of other people as well, were like, dude, you know, here's what we'll do for you and anybody you want to bring with you, but screw this stuff, you know.  And he chose the higher course, the higher road.  All of those kinds of things were reasons why Coach Stevenson thought Toussaint Louverture was a perfect model, and he knew that none of us coming into Cheyney [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania], or very few of us had ever heard of this man and his insistence was in each of us need to know.  And now, he did not denigrate or deny--(gesture) 'Souls of Black Folks' [sic. 'The Souls of Black Folk']?
Speaker 2: Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois]?
Speaker 1: Du Bois.  He did not deny the importance of, you know, name any of them, Banneker [Benjamin Banneker], or the guy in the South with the peanuts [George Washington Carver], you know, or anybody else.  He was respectful and appreciative of Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], but like me, by the way, I tell people this sometimes and they go ooh.  I wasn't no great big fan of Dr. King back in the day, 'cause I wasn't sure that he had the answer.  I wasn't sure that Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] wasn't more on the right track.  I wasn't sure that Malcolm [Malcolm X] didn't have a lot of things to say that resonated with me.
Story_ID: 637257
Speaker 1: What you're saying is not uncommon talk in the northern cities in those days about--
Speaker 2: Gotcha.
Speaker 1: --Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  I mean I grew up, you know I was kid I think during the time and I heard the talk when people would say, you know, "I'm not getting beat upside the head for," you know, "I'm not going to let anybody water hose me."  I mean, of course the northern--people weren't there, weren't part of that, you know, all the time, I mean some were.  But the idea of how you deal with the civil rights problem was not--it wasn't shared universally north and south.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't, and we didn't.  But you're exactly right.  But my point was Coach Stevenson [James Stevenson] didn't deny their importance.  But it was important to him for us not to ignore people before the co- 'cause you remember we had a pretty good crop of models to follow in the mid-'60s [1960s].  I went to school, well, this came later, but I went to school in '60 [1960], fifty- '60 [1960], January of '60 [1960] was when I began, the others began in fifty- September of '59 [1959].  But you know these people were developing and evolving at the time Clayton Powell--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in New York [New York].  Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] was, he was (unclear)--Ralph Bunche was still with us then and there were all of these people and his point 'cause his point was this is all good.  But they're standing on the shoulders of a lot of other people, including the guy, I can't even think of, all these names are leaving my--the guy [Sengbe Pieh; Joseph Cinque] who took over the Amistad [La Amistad], the slave ship.
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear) yeah.
Speaker 2: Anyway, his point is do not forget, do not deny these people.  And it was valued very, very important lessons I got.  The point I'm trying to make with that is there were people at Cheyney [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania] who embraced, who were passionate about so much more than English lit [English literature] and world's, you know the history of world civilization and the introduction to phys- whatever.  They were interested in building--it was a nation kind of thing without the connotation, the negative connotations that came from Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] and the others like that, but they were about--they were about opening minds, and with a level of passion and a commitment, the likes of which I haven't seen matched in anybody whose called themselves a leader before or since.  I admire and respect and have gratitude for those men in ways that, as you know, I find hard to articulate right now, but god they were giants in my term.  And like I said, because we were all, and I mean all of us, Bradley [Ed Bradley] was as big a knucklehead as anybody you've ever known in your life.  And we all were--they would not let us fail.
Story_ID: 637258
Speaker 1: Tell you a real quick story.  I'm a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].  We called Bradley Moon [ph.], and then I'll bring him in then I'll leave him alone and let him rest in peace.  The reason that Bradley is not a brother, Kappa now, is because when we were in school--I pledged in 1961, but we crossed semesters and at Cheyney [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania], in order to stay on line, you had to keep a 3 point--2.0 or 2.5 [grade point average]--you had to have at least a C average.  Bradley had to drop off the line, he was on our line, he had to drop off the line 'cause he didn't have a 2.0 or 2.5, whatever it was.  And not because he wasn't bright, I mean, good lord, 'cause he was a knucklehead.  And so as far as we were concerned we would ride him terrible 'til the day he died, "You still a scroller, dude, what you talking 'bout?"  The point was though that man, Charlie Grant [ph.], I mean how many names can I call went on to achieve wonderful heights and do great things and add, like I said, significantly to the fabric of America because of Coach Stevenson [James Stevenson], James Oliver, Theodore Fortune Flatcher--Fletcher [Theodore T. Fletcher, Sr.]; all of those men who saw in Ed Knucklehead Bradley [Ed Bradley] and Jimmy Knuckhead Vance [HistoryMaker Jim Vance] and all the others, saw things, sparks, that we didn't even know existed in us, and they were minors among other kinds of things.  They went and found mother loads we didn't even know existed.  Those men saved our lives.  Those men gave us lives to live the likes of which our parents and certainly our grandparents couldn't even imagine.  I think from time--I had thought for years of what my--what wonder my [paternal] grandfather [James Vance, Sr.] would behold to see how I live, and this is not in any way having to do with vanity.  But rather, how could he imagine me being sent by people to South Africa, thousands and thousands of miles away to report back to people where I live about all the things that are going on to elect a man who had been in prison for twenty-seven years.  To go cover Mandela [Nelson Mandela], my grandfather couldn't--if you had given him LSD, he couldn't trip out on something like that, you see what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: When did your grandfather pass?
Speaker 1: Sixty--I have it at home, I just looked it--no, 1971.
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971], okay.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 2: I just like--okay.
Speaker 1: He lived to see me in the career that I'm in.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you started around '71 [1971], right?
Speaker 1: Started '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968], okay.
Speaker 1: In Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], for one year and then here since '69 [1969].  I mean not--here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] since 1969.  But anyway, you know, I carry on about Cheyney without apology because you know when they said I got to go to college, I thought, okay, well I'll go to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] or maybe I can get into the, one of the [U.S.] military academies.  Believe it or not, at that point I decided I had something to prove to them sons of bitches, I still hated them, military.  But I was very involved with, oh my god, who was I reading, I can't remember now, some brother who was talking about how much more you can do, how much damage you can do from the inside, that's from the outside, starting to get kind of revolutionary at that point.  But anyway I am so grateful that instead of one of those larger institutions, I went into the womb, is basically what I did when I went to Cheyney.
Speaker 2: So you had a black cultural education.
Speaker 1: Total black cultural education.
Speaker 2: --you know in the-
Speaker 1: Engulfed, embraced, indulged and it was wonderful to say the least.  It was a state teachers college then.  It was the stepchild of the state teachers college system.  We didn't have scholarships.  Everybody that played on any team at Cheyney played because they wanted to play ball.  All of us have the scars and injuries and lifelong impediments from that 'cause we didn't have any medical facilities, training facility, you had nothing, except the desire to play ball and represent.
Story_ID: 637259
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So did you play football for Cheyney [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, played football.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What position did you play?  I never asked you before, but should have asked.
Speaker 2: See how old you really are, I was a split end.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know--
Speaker 2: Remember--what's his name, I can't remember his name at Army [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] who was the first notable split end, call 'em wide receivers now, except we rarely went that far out normally, but it was you know just off the end.  But those were the days of both ways.  So if you started, you played sixty minutes of ball because, oh god, at Cheyney, because we didn't have scholarships or anything else, we had minimal number on the team.  And when I say minimal, I mean we might have twenty-eight, twenty-nine guys, thirty guys.  But if you started--and, oh, you were in the game, third quarter come and so you're here on offense and you don't make the first down, you just turn around and now you're a defensive man (laughter), because that's the way it goes.  Bradley [Ed Bradley] and I used to always tell the story and some of the other guys of how--he was a center on the team and then middle linebacker when we turn it around.  And in the first quarter--I'm sorry, I'm laughing at this 'cause it's just--you had to be there.  First quarter Bradley, he's what, 255 [pounds] then kind of big for that time.  "Army gang," you know the center calls the huddle, you know, and you huddle in, and he's enthusiastic, "Army gang!" And then the second quarter, "Army gang," third quarter comes, Bradley's like, "Over here, guys." And by the fourth quarter, "(Unclear) (makes sounds)," and that's all, you know, he doesn't even call it anymore, and we're all feeling the same way.  And because, on each quarter, with the other teams who are at forty-five, fifty, fifty-five guys, what they put out, we're looking like, just filled with dirt and mud.  Here come these new, brand new fresh uniforms, every quarter, we turn around and it's like, oh, my god, and it's a war for sixty minutes, but there's nobody on those teams that ain't my boy, 'cause when you're playing like that, and you know, they're being paid--not paid, but they're getting at least food, meal tickets.  And when you're out there, just 'cause, you know, you like playing ball, the guys that are also with you like that who stay to the end of the season, 'cause a lot of times a lot of guys would come they'd stay until homecoming so they could get their picture taken and their parents and their girlfriends come see them, then they'd be off the team and they're gone.  We ended most seasons--I remember my first--we ended our season with nineteen guys.  We didn't have two full--eleven guys for us.  You play with guys like that you're with them for all, for life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You don't lose their (unclear).  Another thing for example that Cheyney gave to me.
Story_ID: 637260
Speaker 1: I'm eternally grateful for that school.  Next month will be fifty, my fiftieth reunion and we're all talking about some kind of boat trip or somewhere which I may or may not go to.  I, I enjoy sharing all the upside that there was for me from going to Cheyney [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania] with all of these--the current generation of knuckleheads now, and I want them--I have a couple of places where I do little scholarships thing, and my point with the people at the high schools is I don't want any of this to go to your top students, to your all A's and to your valedictorians or any of them, I want this to go to C students, cause most of us, me--again, I could go a bunch of names, we were not the academic elite, but we went to Cheyney and found a reason to want to be the academic elite.  Now because you're a C student doesn't mean you're a bad guy.
Speaker 2: Now that was my next question, what leadership roles did you engage in at Cheyney?  I would think that you would have--
Speaker 1: Okay, I was never class president or anything else like that, but I insist to this day and I finally got him to agree, that the class president got to be the class president because of me, 'cause I wrote every one of his speeches.  And he's a brilliant guy and I'm not.  But you know how we were talking earlier about some people have a gift with their hands, with, you know greenery, I can write.  And if he came to me in class at one o'clock in the afternoon 'cause he needed his speech at six o'clock, he'd kill 'em at six o'clock with the speech that I wrote between classes going from Burleigh Hall [Cheyney, Pennsylvania] over to Coleman Hall [ph.].  So I was a, not an up front, out front leader.  I was in the process at Cheyney in learning how to represent, as the kids say today.  And I never assumed--I wasn't captain, you know, on any of the teams or anything and never enjoyed any role in that regard, with which I am very, very comfortable because what I did get is all the training and all the seed materials that I needed to be dropped and planted later to be a decent man--that's what I got from Cheyney.  There's unspeakable joy when I got invited back years later to speak at Founders Day, to speak at, you know, this seminar, that forum, whatever, the kinds of things that--oh, the hall of fame, the Cheyney hall of fame a few years ago.  All the things that speak to my having left--had a footprint, you know what I mean.  I'm glad I wasn't just wallpaper.  But I don't think there's any such thing as being wallpaper at an institution like that.  The kind of stuff I'm talking about at Cheyney, they were not all that unusual at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], at Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] back in the day, Delaware State [Delaware State College; Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware] back in the day, go on and on, down, you know, A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina]; any of them.  It's what those institutions did back then; they made men out of us, they made--they gave us purpose and they gave us a reason to (gesture) put your head up (laughter) and to hold it there. Gave me my life, and I'm grateful.
