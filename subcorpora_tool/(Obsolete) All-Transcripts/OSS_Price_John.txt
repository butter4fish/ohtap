 Gill. Today is September 10, 2008. We   re in the  Edmon Low Library on the Oklahoma State University Campus. I   m a  faculty member of the Oklahoma State University Library and this  interview is being conducted as part of the O-STATE Stories Project of  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. And today I   m  interviewing John Price a former Pistol Pete Mascot for Oklahoma State  University. John, first of all, just a little bit of kind of background.  Where did you grow up?  I grew up in Stillwater, believe it or not. My dad was with ROTC   Reserve Officers    Training Corps  and he came back to Stillwater with  my mom, I believe in 1964. He was on staff here with ROTC and went  to Vietnam in 1968 and when he came back from Vietnam, he retired  from the Army. It was a great college town and they had a young to  teenage kids and thought it was a great place to stay and we   ve been  here ever since. I missed all the traveling. My brothers got to do all the  Army traveling. I was at the end of that.  Now your parents are from the Marshall area? Where Angie Debo grew  up?  My grandmother on my mom   s side was from Marshall. My mom was  actually born in Enid because it was the closest big town to Marshall so  they spent all their time there.  John, can you remember your first impression of Pistol Pete, when you  first saw the mascot of Pistol Pete?  Growing up in Stillwater, he was everywhere. You get to where you  love orange and you love Pistol Pete at such an early age. I remember in  my fourth grade class making signs and stickers for Terri Miller. It was  just such a part of the culture. Pistol Pete was always at the  5  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Homecoming parades. It   s funny, because I have such a fond memory  of Walk Around, you know, that was such a big deal. You look forward  to it every year. Now my kids have the same   that   s their favorite night  of the year. So from a very early age. I don   t know that I can  necessarily pinpoint when it started.  Well can you tell us a little bit about how you got to Oklahoma State  University? I mean Stillwater obviously that   s where you started, but  does your parents, your family have a background history of going to  OSU?  Well, actually, my mom went to OSU and my dad went to West Point   United State Military Academy . They met in New York City. A  mutual friend introduced them because they were both living, I think, in  the same apartment building. My dad was going to graduate school at  Columbia and my mom was in New York working and one thing led to  another. When my dad retired from the Army, his family was from  Tulsa. My grandfather was mayor of Tulsa back in the 1930s and so my  dad had grown up in Tulsa and my mom even though with the Marshall  connection had really grown up in Oklahoma City. So Stillwater was  half way in between the grandparents and just a good fit in a lot of  different ways.  Can you tell us a little bit about your OSU experience apart from Pistol  Pete? Some of the things you were involved with, some of the things you  did.  Yes, I started as a freshman in 1986 and was a member of Sigma Chi  fraternity. Had probably a very typical freshman experience   fraternity  experience. Just made a lot of friends, had a great time, was still trying  to figure out who I was and what I wanted to do. I saw an ad, this kind  of leading into how I became Pistol Pete. I saw an ad in the O   Colly that  said Spirit Squad Tryouts and it listed the Pom Squad, the Cheerleaders,  and Pistol Pete. I remember talking to some people in class saying,     You know, I never knew that   s how they did it, that they had try outs.     I said,    I   m going to go try out.    They kind of laughed or whatever.  And I think two weeks later I was one of the two guys who were picked.  Let me kind of pursue this more. Why did you think you wanted to be  Pistol Pete? What appealed to you about it?  I can   t really describe it other than it was like a realization when I   m  sitting there reading the paper. I was like,    You know what, there   s  actually a person in there. It   s a student. I could be Pistol Pete. I could  do that.    Almost on a whim really because I didn   t believe that, you  know. I guess I was still kind of thinking that Pete wasn   t a real person  6  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  under the head. That it was that way all the time. A little bit of curiosity  I guess more than anything.  You talked about the tryout. Can you tell us a little bit about the tryout  process and what you did to prepare for it?  Yes, it   s basically a panel interview. They have some former Pistol Petes  and usually they might have either the sponsor of the Spirit Squad or  maybe the athletic director. Dave Martin, of course, is very involved  with the Pistol Petes and the Spirit Squad as a whole. They basically  talk to you and put some questions to you to see what kind of, what I  would call, what kind of ambassador you would be for the University.  They also do some things in the Pistol Pete outfits to see how you  manage the head because it   s a pretty substantial costume. It   s physically  very limiting because it   s so heavy and so big. Basically, just a panel  interview.  Well, what years did you serve as Pistol Pete, John?  1988 to 1990. I did it two years.  So you did it the Barry Sanders    football year?  Yeah.  Great.  Yeah.  What a great time to be Pete.  Oh, my gosh, it was so much excitement and so much fun. I want to say  that was the year where he ran the opening kickoff back. The first play  of the game he gets the opening kickoff and runs it back and everybody  realized that we were on the verge of something special and that  excitement built the entire season. It just kept getting bigger and bigger  and bigger. And what a time to be involved with OSU athletics. It was  just something else. And such a great guy, he   s such a good fellow.  You talked about trying on the head.  Mm-hmm.  Could you just kind of describe the Pistol Pete outfit and obviously  starting with the head and then some other things?  7  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Well the head    there are two versions of it. They   re basically the same,  and they   re made of fiberglass. They   re built around a frame of a hat that  actually sits on your head. They   re about 45 to 50 pounds depending on  which one you   re wearing and they   re pretty limiting. If you bend over  too far, they will fall over. You just have to get used to it. You carry  most of the weight on your shoulders. You just have to get used to how  to move and keep your back real straight. I want to say, and one of the  fellows might have talked about this, that they were made by a craftsman  who used to work at Disneyland. I don   t know that you could replace  them really. They   re really two of a kind, but one of a kind. We just  happen to have two of them.  What about the rest of the outfit?  Very traditional. You know, white shirt, blue or black jeans, cowboy  boots, chaps, and then I think we   ve also added spurs and a black leather  vest. So, fairly traditional outfit.  Was all that provided for you, John?  Yes, I   m not sure who   s providing that now, but all that was provided  for us. At the time I did it, we went down to a store in Oklahoma City,  Tener   s and they measured us and had us try stuff on and got us all  outfitted.  Now that you passed the tryout and became Pete, did they talk to you  about the expectations, behavioral expectations? Dos and don   ts?  Yes, first of all, they try to get us in touch with the person who   s going  to be our sponsor, whether that   s the Spirit Squad sponsor or   at the  time I did it, we were working really closely with Dave Martin. Dave  really had a hands on involvement at that time and they coach you  through the process. They also give us the names of some former Pete   s  that we can call and say,    Hey, what if this happens       or    I ran into this  the other day what should I         you know those types of things. During  the interview, they really stress good judgment. Make the right decision,  do the right thing, because you are thrown into some situations whether  it   s how to react to a crowd or someone who   s maybe giving you a little  grief or something. You   re constantly put in situations where you have  to make good decisions. And there is a certain amount of trial by fire.  Because I remember the very first thing I did   and there   s a lot of non  OSU things you do too, public appearances and things like that. The  very first thing I did was a karate tournament. They said,    We   re having  a karate tournament at Gallagher-Iba. Could you just come by and walk  in the door and wave at everybody, since it   s in our house. Just come by  8  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  and say hello.    I said,    Okay.    So I walk in the door and sneak under  the bleachers where we had our spot where we can get our stuff on and  be able to come out. Right as I walk out, right as I turn the corner and  walk out the first thing that happens is I feel somebody grab the gun.  And I turn around and here   s a kid in his karate outfit holding the gun. I  mean just right there, right as I got out. I remember reaching down and  taking it away from him, putting it back. There were kids in karate suits  everywhere. I can   t even tell you how many kids must have been at that  place. I just got absolutely mobbed as soon as I came out from  underneath the bleachers, about five or ten kids deep.  You talked about appearances, public appearances. How many  appearances did you make, athletic and public the years you Pete?  Between the two of us, we made over five hundred appearances. And I  want to say my last year, I made over three hundred. And that   s  everything from the Founders    Day Parade in Glencoe to birthday  parties to, of course, all of the OSU events. Any   grand opening of  grocery stores I mean anything that we can fit in time wise, we   ll try to  be at.  John, you don   t get a scholarship for being Pete, but did you get paid for  the public appearances?  You can get paid for public appearances. I don   t know what the current  policy was, but since we did not receive a scholarship anything that was  non-OSU related they did allow us to charge an hourly fee and mileage  on. Basically, just to compensate us for our time and effort to get there  and things like that.  Was your Pistol Pete experience anything like you thought it was going  to be John? I mean, based on your expectations going in?  Oh, from what I thought it might be, to what it actually was, it was  exponentially different. Truly a life changing deal. I thought I bled  orange before, but afterwards it   s just   when you get the chance to meet  Frank Eaton   s family and when you understand that   I think OSU   s  fortunate in that our mascot has real ties to the place. There   s a certain  aspect of history and culture that goes along with it that I think is really  unique to college mascots. Pistol Pete appears on everything. He   s  everywhere. We take it very seriously.  Well, what was the typical week like for you during school when you  were Pete and also trying to keep your grades and what kind of schedule  did you have to keep?  9  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Well, I   d say we had probably five or six appearances a week so you   d  usually have maybe two or three during the week. And then game days  were huge. You   d get up first thing in the morning on game days and  start making appearances. We   d go to maybe a Posse luncheon and then  a reception over at one of the banks or something like that and then  come back to campus for something on the library lawn. Game days  were just kind of like a non-stop schedule of events. One stop after the  other. We   d usually break up the football game into two halves. One of  us would do one half and one of us would do the other.  Did you have trouble kind of balancing the two lives? Your Pete life and  your student life?  Yeah, every once in a while. Every once in a while because you do get  caught up in   you get so busy, you get very busy. But probably like a  lot of people, I found that the more busy I got it just forces you be that  much more organized. You just kind of take care of business and realize  that this is what you do and how to get through it  Well kind of going back a little John, the first time you stepped out on  the field, what were your feelings? What were your emotions when you  first portrayed Pete at an athletic event?  It   s really overwhelming because when you   re down there on the field  and you see all the folks up in the stands and the flags and banners and  the team comes running out. It   s pride. Pride that you   re able to be  down there and represent the school and again, it   s just such a big part of  who we are and where we come from and kind of a culmination of   up  to that point, a lifetime of memories.  Do you remember the first time you stepped out what the event was?  Not the karate, but the OSU athletic event and your feelings?  I want to say that the first time I was at the    89er ballpark at the very end  of the baseball season. We had just been picked and we went to the    89er  stadium. And went to the Big Eight, I think at that time it was the Big  Eight still, Championships. You know, that was great because I want to  say one of my very first events was a Bedlam baseball game. It was a  really good experience as far as seeing how the OU folks reacted and  how the OSU folks reacted. It was a lot of fun.  Did you ever get harassment from, I   ll say, from opposing fans from  whatever school?  Yeah, yeah. Nine times out of ten, it was in good fun. Very friendly,  you know just kind of kidding. Every once in a while it got a little  10  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  heated. (Laughter)  You mentioned earlier, John, about the significance of the historical  Frank Eaton character. How did that, in your mind, make our mascot at  Oklahoma State University different from other schools mascots?  Well, I think just the personal connection and a sense of responsibility to  portray somebody in a positive light. Not just who he was, but also  cowboys and folks in general    you know, hard working, honest, and  the whole kind of cowboy American folklore that goes into that. I think  there   s a responsibility to portray that accurately and to do it justice.  How does Pistol Pete represent the spirit of Oklahoma State University  and the state of Oklahoma?  Well let   s think about that. That   s a good question.  The Wild West motif kind of     Yes, absolutely. Standing up for what you believe in, perseverance. All  those things factor into it. All the things that you hear about from the  Old West and from the settlers, all the things they had to overcome. Just  standing up. When things are good or bad, you   re there. You know, you  keep going   you keep going.  From your conversations with the family, you know a little bit about  Frank Eaton. Are there certain characteristics of Frank that you tried to  portray? When you were Pete?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We try to have a certain walk     Swagger?  A little swagger. And be very animated and always put that hand out  there to shake somebody   s hand or pat a child on the head. One of the  things I take great pride in at OSU is I think this is absolutely one of the  friendliest campuses I   ve ever been to. When you see Pistol Pete and  the first thing he does is put out his hand, I think that speaks volumes in  a way. I really do. Because that   s what we   re all about.  Can you share some particular personal moments you recall that were  special to you as Pete?  Oh yeah, absolutely. Pete   s always very involved in the Special  Olympics. Every summer OSU, for a long time now, has been the host  site for the Special Olympics. We always try to get out there as much as  11  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  we can. That is such a rewarding experience when the kids come up to  you and embrace you and they   re triumphing in their events and they  want to celebrate so they come up and celebrate with you. It   s really  rewarding.  And then, I   ve told the other Petes this time and time again. I had a  particular touching moment when I was Pete. I was scheduled to do a  birthday party and it was up in southern Kansas, or northern Oklahoma.  It was several miles away. It was a good hour, hour and a half drive.  And I got up and it was snowing and it was not good conditions to travel  in. I thought to myself,    Well do I call them or do I?    I thought,    Well  I   ve got about an hour, I think I can make it before it really gets bad.     So, I went ahead and jumped in my little Honda and made the trek up  the road. I got up there and I walked in the door and the little boy, I  found out later that it was his birthday. When I walked in the door he  jumped up like you would not believe. I remember he pointed   I  believe at his grandmother and his mother and he said    I told you, I told  you he   d come.    That made it all worthwhile right there, you know. His  mother came up to me and she goes    I was waiting for the call to  cancel.    And she goes,    I am so      you know I mean he was fired up.  That right there, that was enough for a life time for me.  Let   s flip flop on you, John. Any embarrassing moments you had as a  Pete that you can think of?  Yeah     Other than the kid pulled the gun out on you.  Well, it was actually another gun related incident. We were getting ready  to score at the Kansas State and it was bitter cold up there   really really  cold. And we were just like on the one yard line, or something like that  and of course we fire the shotgun after we score a touchdown. We were  getting ready to score, and I had already cocked it and I was getting  ready to put it in the air and we fumbled the ball. We fumbled the ball  so I had to uncock it and put it back. As I was doing that I shot myself  in the foot. Of course it was blank, so it didn   t do anything but left a  little burn mark on my boot. It was funny because everybody knew why  I had done it, because we were getting ready to score. It was a done deal  and then had to back off of it.  Kind of along the same thing. Just sort of generally you alluded to your  interactions with OSU alumni, OSU fans, particularly kids. Anything  you want to share about how you feel about that?  Just that they   re probably the warmest most gracious folks that you   ll  12  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  ever run into. I can   t tell you the times I   ve been some place as Pete  where somebody offered me a hamburger, or gave me a ride, or you  know,    Hey can I carry that for you.    It   s just those little things that  mean so much. And really, I think, tells you what kind of folks we have  here.  Did you feel a special sense of responsibility to represent Oklahoma  State as Pistol Pete?  Oh absolutely, absolutely, because you are representing so many people,  campus wide, statewide, nationwide, worldwide. It   s the entire OSU  family.  What did being Pistol Pete mean to you at the time? Do you recall what  the significance of it for you at that time?  At that time, I was just struck by the fact that regardless of how many  basketball players there were or football players, or cheerleaders, there  were only two Pistol Petes. And that we had a pretty significant job we  had to do. We tried to focus on just doing the best we could and  realizing the responsibility that we were shouldering and go from there.  Looking back and reflecting on it now several years later, what does it  mean to you now?  Just the things it taught me about how to talk with people, how to deal  with kids, how to speak before a group, how to handle pressure, how to  handle deadlines. I mean it was just an education and indoctrination into  a lot of different things and also gave me the chance to, I feel, give back  to my Alma Mater, even though I gave back at kind of a young age and  different way. I feel that it was some type of service.  Maybe the opposite side of that question, how do you think fans feel  about Pistol Pete?  I think there   s just a unique sense of pride there. Because he   s, I think,  unlike any other college mascot and I   d say probably one of the most  recognizable. I think we have a real unique opportunity in the sense of a  unique identity tied up in that mascot.  Did you ever compete in a mascot competition as Pete?  No, not really. We went to some camps. I did ski in the Pistol Pete head  which was, looking back on it, probably not the best idea (Laughter).  We went to outside of Boulder where ESPN, I think, did some kind of  mascot ski tournament to benefit the March of Dimes or something like  13  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  that. They sent us a stand-by airline ticket and then we all went to, I  think it was, Winter Park and spent the day out there doing publicity and  little ski races and things like that. It   s funny because I   m pretty sure  that the Arizona State Sun Devil was a member of the ski team. I   m just  kind of trying to snow plow and get down the mountain, and that guy  takes off like a rocket. I mean just straight down   so.  Might of had a little bit of experience?  Yeah, I think so. I think so.  Well, think about your legacy as a Pete   how do you want to be  remembered as Pistol Pete? How do you hope people remember you?  I just hope that people remember me as a good representative, and a  friendly guy who tried to go to as many events as possible to spread the  good news about OSU.  You alluded to it briefly earlier, but again, how did being Pistol Pete,  influence your life? Then and since?  I think it   s affected me just in the way I   ve always tried to carry myself.  I think, in one way or another even still I think of myself as a  representative of OSU no matter who I   m dealing with or what context  I   m dealing with somebody. I think I still carry that responsibility to be  a good representative and do the right thing and deal with people in a  certain way.  Have you ever gotten introduced somewhere as a former Pete?  Oh Yeah, yeah.  And does that still kind of impact you?  Yeah. Yeah.  And a certain legacy even though it   s been years ago, and certain  expectations of you since you were a Pete?  Yeah. Yeah.  Must be a gung ho guy, or something like that.  Yeah. Yeah  Do you ever think about that?  14  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Price  Gill  Oh yeah, yeah. And there are still people that when I see them, they call  me Pistol Pete. That   s just kind of the way it is.  What life lessons and disciplines did you learn that you are able to take  with you after being Pete?  I think it   s important to believe in something, to feel good about  something and to do your best to represent that in a positive way.  What would you tell an OSU student now who was thinking about being  Pistol Pete? What would you say to him?  As far as if like somebody wanted to be Pistol Pete? I   d tell them that  it   s the greatest experience they could possibly have at OSU. That the  number of different things that they   d be exposed to. There were things  on campus that I didn   t have any idea that they took place. Whether it  was different clubs that asked us to come. I mean, you just get such a  broad view of the campus that you couldn   t possibly get exposed to in  another type of way, as being a student. You get the whole picture, and  you get to be part of it.  You   d tell them to go for it?  Oh absolutely. Absolutely.  John, again if you could relive that experience and have that  opportunity   .  I   d still be doing it right now. (Laughter) Yeah, I   d still be doing it right  now.  That   s great. Well John, it   s been a great interview. Anything thoughts  you   d like to share with us that haven   t come out in our conversation?  No, just that OSU means so much to me and I hope that at that point in  my life I was able to give back a little bit in some way. I just think that  OSU has so much to offer and has done so much more for me than I can  ever really hope to repay, but I   m trying.  Anything else?  I think that   s got it.  Thanks, Okay.  -------  -------  15
