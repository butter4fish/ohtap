Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone.
Speaker 2: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And they're kind of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: These are little questions.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: The first little question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is it?
Speaker 2: Fried chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you, the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  "If you can keep your head when all about you / Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, / If you can trust yourself without doubting [sic.] / And make allowance for their doubting too."  That is the, those are the first lines of 'If.'
Speaker 1: By Rudyard Kipling, right.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am, okay.
Speaker 2: But those are my favorite lines.
Story_ID: 645516
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And before that, I want to make sure I have a pen that writes.  I think my pen has run out of ink.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family first--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then your father's [Junius Reed] side of the family.  So--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: On your mother's side, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's full name is Christine O'Neal Nicholson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: N-I-C-H-O-L-S-O-N.  Her maiden name was O'Neal; Christine O'Neal.
Speaker 1: O'Neal is spelled O--
Speaker 2: --N-E-A-L.
Speaker 1: --N-E-A-L, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was July 27, 1910.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Hartsville, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how much do you know about your mother's side of the family?  Do you know a lot?  Do you know where they came from?  And have they always been in Hartsville?  Or--?
Speaker 2: No, I really don't.  As far as I know, they all lived in Hartsville.  There was a place called the country. Hartsville was a very, very, small town, but the country was out where they planted cotton and potatoes and all kinds of vegetables and crops.  So my mother came from the country, and that's where her family lived.  But it was still Hartsville, South Carolina.  My grandfather was very fair, as was my mother.  Many people thought that she belonged to the Caucasian race.  Neither of them did, and neither of them ever acted as if they were.  I don't know much about my grandfather.  He died I think before I was born.  His name was Seneca O'Neal, S-E-N-E-C-A, Seneca O'Neal.  And my grandmother's name on my mother's side was Ann O'Neal [Annie Young O'Neal].
Story_ID: 645517
Speaker 1: There were six of the children in, on my mother's [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] side.  Some of them were close and some were not so close.  The sisters were close.  The brothers were not as close.  And one of my uncles lived with his mother until she died.  My other uncle lived in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and raised a family there.  He lived there with his family and had--I'm sorry, he only had three children.  But he lived there until he died.  I only knew well my mother's niece, one of her sister's children, who remained in Hartsville [South Carolina], although she had gone away to New York.  But she came back to Hartsville.  So, Hartsville was the place for all of us, and especially South Carolina.  My cousin, whom Harrison [HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] knew, my husband knew, was named Robbie.  Robbie, Ruffin was the name of her husband.  And she was, she was, oh, the most aggressive one of the whole family, Robbie (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And this is your cousin?
Speaker 1: My cousin, Robbie O'Neal Ruffin.
Speaker 2: How so?  How much do you know about her?
Speaker 1: Even before the Afro came out, Robbie would wear an Afro.  This was back in the '40s [1940s], she would wear an Afro.  She would wear short skirts.  She lived with my grandmother, as did her sister, Frances, who was just the opposite of Robbie.  But when mothers went away during those days, as they often did, most often to New York, they left their children with their mother.  And oftentimes, the real mother never came.  And so the only child, the only mother that the child knew, was the grandmother.  So, that was the case with Robbie and Frances.  Their mother, who was my mother's sister, went away and left them with my grandmother.  And so, she became Robbie O'Neal, the name of my mo-, my grandmother.  And her sister was Frances O'Neal [ph.], because they were raised by my grandmother, Ann O'Neal [Annie Young O'Neal].
Story_ID: 645518
Speaker 1: This is the other side of a story we hear quite often in New York, about people coming from South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But we don't hear about the children left behind in South Carolina and what they had to do, and that--so it's another side of the story.  So, somebody is actually going away to New York and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and was your--were your family members excited to have somebody in New York?  Or was it considered like a--was that a pretty common thing around that part of South Carolina (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, well, they were excited.  Because people would come back from New York and say, "Oh, I'm making thirteen smackers a week" (laughter).  And that was a lot of money, because my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] was working for two dollars a week.  She was working as a domestic worker, and later as a cook.  And I never remembered that she worked--that she did anything else except that, in the home of a lady by the name of Mrs. Twitty, T-W-I-T-T-Y.  And she, my mother acted as if that was her home, as if Miss Twitty's home was her own home.  We lived several miles from Miss Twitty's house, because we lived in the colored part of town [Hartsville, South Carolina].  And so, we had to walk quite a way.  When I say we, I mean my mother and I, had to walk quite a way to get to Miss Twitty's house.  Now, the reason I went with my mother was that there were no buses, no way of my getting to school.  And my school did not begin until 10:30 in the morning.  At that time, I was the only child at home.  I'll tell you about my brother [James O'Neal] later, who is older than I, who was older than I.  But we would have to walk across what they called the trestle, under which there was a lake, running water, a running water lake.  And the spaces between the trestle planks were wide enough for a child to fall through.  And so it was a very dangerous situation, especially in the wintertime when it had rained and the trestle planks had water on them, and turned to ice.  And I remember that one day my mother and I were going across the trestle and the train was coming in the opposite direction.  And it was not stopping, it was not slowing down or whatever.  And we ran across the trestle and landed on the other side in the mud to keep from being killed.  But that was an example of some of the hardships that my mother had to endure, and I along with her, in order to survive.  Miss Twitty was a wonderful person, and saw something in me for whatever reason.  Well, I do know the reason.  But she saw something in me that she thought needed to be preserved.  And so she left me fifty dollars so that I could go to college.
Speaker 1: So, she passed away before you, you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, long (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --long ago.
Story_ID: 645519
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She left you fifty dollars for college?
Speaker 2: She left me fifty dollars for college.  That was not enough, but that was more than I had.  But I said earlier that I knew why Miss Twitty was drawn to me.  My mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] would teach me speeches.  She, herself, could have been a speaker, but she was very shy, very withdrawn, very intimidated by the fact that she was very light skinned. And she was teased about that and ridiculed about that.  But she would teach me speeches, my mother would.
Speaker 1: She was ridiculed by the black community?
Speaker 2: By the black community for being so fair skinned.  And I would say these speeches to Mrs. Twitty.  She stayed in bed most of the time, I don't know why.  But she was not a well person, I'm sure.  And my mother would pick a time just after Miss Twitty had been served breakfast, and she would tell Miss Twitty, "Lucy Mae [HistoryMaker Lucy R. Wilson]," which is my name, she would say, "Lucy Mae has a speech that she wants to say to you," and I would go up.  And my mother had taught me how to curtsy, which I did, and bowed.  And then I would say the speech.  And she said, "Lucy Mae, that was very, very, good.  I want you to go to college.  I want you to be a mathematician."  Well, that frightened me to death, because math was not my favorite subject, nor one in which I did well.  But I thanked her, and let her know that I appreciated anything that she could do for me, because that's what my mother taught me, to be grateful for whatever.  When Miss Twitty died, of course, we were not allowed to go to the funeral, because that was a part of the segregation process.  Blacks and whites simply did not mix in any way, no matter how close they were.  As a matter of fact, when my mother died, and this was in 1974, the nurse who had helped her and treated her, asked if it would be okay for her to attend my mother's funeral.  And I said, "Of course," whatever her name was, "of course."  But I give you that as an example of how very segregated and how separated the races were, even in 1974.  But that's just a glimpse into my mother's life.
Story_ID: 645520
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] talk about what it was like for her growing up?  Did she have a chance to--you said she was, she had a proclivity for speech, but she wasn't able to really--she was shy about it.  Did she go to school in--?
Speaker 2: She went to the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She went to the sixth grade, and I guess at that time she was thirteen or fourteen.  And when she was that age, she was raped by the owner of the farm in Hartsville [South Carolina] on which my grandparents [Annie Young O'Neal and Seneca O'Neal] lived.  And there was a child born of that, of that, union, my brother [James O'Neal]; very, very, fair, of course.  And when my mother married my father, who was very dark, he did not want my brother to live in the house.  And so my brother lived with my grandmother until my father left us, and my mother then took him in.  He was two years younger--I'm sorry, two years older than I.  And later, my mother of course married my father, whose name was Junius Reed.  And I was the result of their union, as was my brother, whose name is Junius Reed.  He's still living, my brother is.  My father passed in my brother's home.  I never cared for my father, because when I was eleven he left home.  He had been cut, he was stabbed, oh, maybe four or five years later.  And--
Speaker 1: He had some sort of altercation with--?
Speaker 2: With somebody down in Hoptown [Hartsville, South Carolina].  Hoptown was the, across the, down in the valley where all of the bad people partied and drank and lived.  And ironically, my high school [Butler High School, Hartsville, South Carolina] was located in that same area.  So the day after my father had been stabbed and I went to school, his blood was all over the school- schoolyard.
Story_ID: 645521
Speaker 1: My father [Junius Reed] was not a gentle man.  He beat my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson].  But I have to give it to her, she fought back.  She fought back.  And she always knew that I was with her, that she was my staff.  And I remember one night we were living in one of these shotgun houses.  Do you know what a shotgun house is?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But tell the people, so that--
Speaker 1: A shotgun house is a house that is built one room behind the other, just a long--a row of rooms, one behind the other.  So if you shot in the front window, it would come out the back door, because there was no, there was no, there was no side to either side of the house.  There was, there was nothing except this family room, or whatever you wanted to make it.  But three rooms, one behind the other.  And we were living in that shotgun house, and Mama and Daddy had had a fight.  And she whispered to me--I was only--oh, gracious, I must have been ten or eleven, maybe younger.  But she said, "Go and crank up the car."  She whispered to me, "Go and crank up the car."  We had a '34 [1934] Chevrolet.  And I was born in '30 [1930], so I was probably--and it was an old car--so I must have been, oh, eleven or twelve, I would say.  "Go and crank up the car," and I did.  So she ran out and got in the other side of the car, in the front seat of the car.  And I was driving down this dirt road, and I saw my father in the mirror, and he was running behind us with these long, white drawers on.  It was the funniest sight I had ever seen in my life (laughter). And then at that time, cars had running boards.  So, he caught up with the car and jumped on the running board, but then there were briar bushes on the side.  So, as I was driving the car and he was leaning over with these white drawers with the back out, those briar bushes were whipping his behind like Mama never could have (laughter).  I thought that was so funny.  And I really thought it was so funny that I had to give up driving at that time.  He, he, really overtook us, so we went back to the house.  But that was one of the examples of the, of the altercations (laughter).
Speaker 2: They had a tem- tempestuous relationship.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yes, they did.  Yes, they did (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 645522
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, let me ask you this before we--let me try to get his side of the family, you know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --covered, too--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) while we're talking about it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's Junius, J-U-N-I-U-S, Reed, R-E-E-D [Junius Reed].
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His place of birth is Hartsville, South Carolina.  And I think he was born, I think he was five years older than my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson].  So, he was probably born in 1905.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there any, I mean what do you know about his side of the family?  Do you know anything about the ancestors on his side, or where they came from?
Speaker 2: They were from Hartsville, of course.  Everybody's from Hartsville.  And his father was very tall and his brothers were very tall.  I remember three brothers, he might have had more.  There was Clarence [Clarence Reed], Lawrence [Lawrence Reed], and Willie [Willie Reed].  My father was very short.  My father's mother, I don't remember at all.  The only woman that I remember was a woman that my father's father had married, and I put that in quotes, because I'm not sure that they were.  And I don't remember her name.  Now, my Uncle Lawrence was quite accomplished financially.  He had moved to New York [New York] and he was, he had a high status in a dry cleaning business.  He did not own the dry cleaning business, but he was a presser, or something more than the average black was able to do.  And he reminded me of a very tall Denzel Washington, a very attractive man, very handsome man, and dressed to kill.  He really dressed himself up.  And when he came home, we were all just so proud of Uncle Lawrence.  When my father left us and went to New York--
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you when your father left?
Speaker 2: He left us, let me see.  I think I was probably fifteen.  And I'm guessing at that age, fifteen.  My brother was born in, when I was eleven.  And I know my father did not live, I mean, did not stay with us very long after that.  But he would insist that my brother come to see him every summer.  And of course, I was the only one who could take my brother there.  So he would accept me, because I was, it was convenient for me to take his son to see him.  But when I really fell out with my father was a year that I was not going to be able--or at least I thought I was not going to be able to take my brother to see him, because I had begun working by then.  And I needed a summer job, because I was thinking about college and so forth.  And he said, "Well, if Junius [Junius Reed] can't come, then I don't want Lucy Mae [HistoryMaker Lucy R. Wilson] to come."  And that let me know how he felt about me.  And, but I would continue to go up every summer and take my brother, and sometimes I would find a little job for myself.  But I also had to take care of him, so it was very, very difficult.  And that went on for, for many years until I went to college.
Story_ID: 645523
Speaker 1: Now, before I get you to college, I want to--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --maybe go back a little bit to growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There's a question we always have to ask, and it's this: what are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights was--the sight that I remember most I think was called the creek, what we used to call across the creek, where we lived.  The creek separated us from, us, the African Americans, from the whites.  And that creek was sort of a mainstay.  But we could swim in it, we could, you know, play in the mud around the creek.  That was our swimming pool.  So, that was one of the sights that I remember probably most.  The other was--the community in which I lived, all of the houses were the same, were built the same, the shotgun houses.  Because they belonged to the paper mill, which still exists to this day.  It was called Sonoco, S-O-N-O-C-O, Sonoco Products Company at that time.  And that's where all the men worked.
Speaker 1: That's not associated with Sunoco oil company [Sun Oil Company; Sunoco] at all, is it?
Speaker 2: Yes [sic.].
Speaker 1: It is?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes, they really expanded and became Sunoco oil company, Sunoco petroleum.  But at first it was just the cotton mill.  It was just the cotton mill, and that's where--it provided employment for just about everybody in Hartsville, South Carolina.
Story_ID: 645524
Speaker 1: Now, oh, I was asking you about sights, sounds and smells, and you were telling me about the Sonoco owned shotgun houses and mill, cotton mill [Sonoco Products Company].
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm, and the lake, or the creek as we called it.  So, those were the things that I remember. Those are the things that I remember seeing around me.  Sounds?  I think I remember most the sound of what we now call an artesian well.  But in Hartsville [South Carolina], right in the back of our house was running water that ran all the time.  And that's where the community got its water from; where the entire community got its water from.  And it was the best water.  It's much better than the water that you pay for today.  But, and we did not call it an artesian well.  We just called it a pump, "Go by the pump."  And many people had to come through our yards to get to the pump.  But I remember that sound of the running water, and knowing that we had fresh water all the time.  But I also remember an unpleasant situation that happened.  And that is that my father [Junius Reed] was having an affair with one of the neighbors who had to use the pump, and who had to come through our yard to get to the pump.  And I remember that my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] and I were sitting on the back step which was closest to the pump shelling beans, butterbeans.  And this lady came through our yard to get water, to get, to go get water.  And my mother said to her as she was coming back, "Don't ever come through my yard again."  It might have been some expletives in there, which I'm not going to say, but she told her in no uncertain terms that she was not to come through her yard again.  And my mother had a knife in the bean pan, so she was not, she was not kidding at all.  She was a wonderful woman, but she knew how to take care of herself.  I hope I'm like that.  I've tried to be like her.  And the woman never did.  But I also remember--and this is, this is a story that I'm sure my husband [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] would not want me to tell.  But I'm going to tell it anyway, because it's a part of, it's part of my life.  Ray Howard belonged to the family who lived right in front of us.  Miss Maybelle Howard [ph.], not (pronunciation) Maybelle, but Maybelle Howard, had fourteen children, and Ray was about my age.  So when Ray went to the pump, I could see how much water he could carry.  So I went to my mother crying, saying, "Ray Howard can carry more water than I can, Mama."  And she said, "Don't you worry, because you can carry more pee than he can" (laughter).  We, we did not have, we did not have a bathroom, of course.  And so we used to use what we called the slop jar, and that's, that's where we, where we went to the bathroom at night.  And of course that had to be cleaned and prepared for the next night, and that was one of my jobs.  So that's why Mama said, "You can carry more pee than Ray can carry" (laughter).  Ask me another question, please (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I need to get away from this (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 645525
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well this is something I've noticed since I've talk- I've been having this conversation with you, that your voice has a quality that reminds me of [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And I was wondering if Eartha Kitt was from the same area of South Carolina.  I know she's from South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, I was just wondering.  There's a very similar quality to your voice.
Speaker 2: Yes.  No, Eartha Kitt is from a place they call North, South Carolina.  And I have to tell you that I have never heard of it, except in relation to Eartha Kitt.  I had never heard of it, although I'd lived in South Carolina all of my life, went to school in South Carolina, and lived in South Carolina after my first marriage.  But I've never heard of North, South Carolina.  So, I don't doubt at all that she was born there; I just never heard of the place, yes.  And I don't think I sound like Eartha Kitt at all. But--
Speaker 1: It's not exactly the same.  There's a certain kind of quality in it, though, that reminds me of--it's just me, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Maybe my impression.  But I just wondered.  It's--her voice was such that you couldn't figure out where she was from, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She didn't, you wouldn't guess South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you didn't, you didn't know where she was from.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: It's more of a tonal thing, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I was surprised really, when I read that about her some years ago.  Because I had never heard of her, I mean, as a South Carolinian.  Nor had I, did I know where North, South Carolina was.  But she was a beautiful lady, and she did well in the--in drama, in singing, and in sounding like the kitten that she was.  She was never one of my favorite people, but I have to give her her dues.
Story_ID: 645526
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you about growing up [in Hartsville, South Carolina].  What, how would you describe yourself growing up?  What were you interested in, and what kind of a little girl were you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was interested in speaking.  I loved to speak.  And my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] would, they would give us these little speeches, you know, from the school or from the church.  And we always had Easter and Children's Day and Mother's Day.  We celebrated those things.  Because church was about all that we had, and that was our entertainment.  And if you did well in the church, well, you did well.  You were regarded as an accomplished person.  And so, speaking was one of the things that I thoroughly enjoyed.  But my mother would write speeches for me, and they were long speeches.  I think the only speech that I gave that she did not write was Weldon Johnson's 'Creation' ['The Creation,' James Weldon Johnson], and you know how long that is.  Well, I learned that to a tee.  Oh, I thought I was, oh, I was really something when I recited 'The Creation' with all of the gestures that go along with it.  But then my mother would write speeches for me and I would say those.  They were always long and involved.
Speaker 1: Did they have a certain theme?  I mean--
Speaker 2: No, they didn't, except they were, they were related to religion.  Like, "You can't buy blues in judgment, nor bear no trials there.  Unless you are converted, you'll live in deep despair.  Christians, hold up your light.  Hold up the light of God.  God will conquer the devil and all his hellish hosts.  Unless you are converted, you will suffer all the most."  Those are the things, the kinds of speeches that my mother taught me.  And she could have been such an educator.  Because she was, with just that sixth grade education.  But life interfered with her, with her judgment, with her progress, with her ability to recognize what she was capable of.  And I sometimes, I sometimes get emotional about that.  But she was a wonderful, a wonderful woman.
Story_ID: 645527
Speaker 1: Now when--you said earlier that when she was a teenager, she was raped and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was that an unusual situation in South Carolina in those days?  Or was that something that, you know, happened pretty much?
Speaker 2: I think it was--I think it was, it was very common.  I think it was unusual for the person to have the child, which my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] did.  But you didn't hear too much of--you didn't see the results of a woman having been raped by a white person.  You didn't see that many fair-skinned people that didn't have fair--other fair-skinned people in their families.  And so while I think rape was common during my mother's day, I think many people aborted or did not have a child.  But my mother did, and he was such a wonderful person.  He was, he was so good that when he was living in the country, as he did with my grandmother [Annie Young O'Neal] until he was in the eighth grade--and that's as far as the country schools went.  Then, by then my father [Junius Reed] had left, my father.  My biological father had left.  And so I said to Mama, "Why can't we have Jay [James O'Neal] to come" because I loved him dearly.  And she did.  He came and lived with us and finished high school in, at Butler High School [Hartsville, South Carolina], the same place that I finished.  But people, people ridiculed him, and he was so soft that he, he would just say, "Let it go, Lucy Mae [HistoryMaker Lucy R. Wilson].  Let it go.  Just let it go.  Don't worry about that."
Speaker 1: So he must have really looked like he was white, I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, he did.  Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Because your mother was already fair-skinned.  And--
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes.  He looked--you could not tell that he was not.
Speaker 1: In fact, biologically, he probably was white.
Speaker 2: He was.  He was.  He had certainly more than one eighth, and, certainly more than one eighth, you know, to be black.  They say if you're one eighth, you're black (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's all really kind of--I say biological.  But it's all kind of crazy in a lot of ways.  They say now it doesn't really--it's hard to--you can't tell where one race leaves off and another begins (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's true, that's true.
Speaker 1: Anyway, but he liked like what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He, he--
Speaker 1: On sight, he looked like what people considered a white man?
Speaker 2: That's right.  He had straight hair, bone straight blond hair.  And he went to Butler, and he was so gentle that I would fight for him.  I didn't mind fighting when I was in school.  Whatever came up, I'd fight about it.  And of course when they teased him, I would fight about that, fight about him.  And he would say, "Come on Lucy, that's all right.  Don't worry about it."  And--
Speaker 1: But it's hard to imagine your--now, we interviewed your husband [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] earlier and he said he loved to fight.  But it was easier to imagine that.  But to--it's hard for me to imagine you as somebody who's ready to fight (unclear).
Speaker 2: I was.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 645528
Speaker 1: The environment you were in was pretty hostile, I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was.  It was.  And you almost had to know how to fight to survive.  You know, because people would tease you about any and everything--being fair-skinned, or even browner than the next person.  And sometimes you didn't know what they were after you about.  I remember I would--we were changing classes at Butler High School [Hartsville, South Carolina], and there were, well, these girls.  I'll never forget their names.  They were my classmates.  One was Aquilla Wright.  Her sister was Naomi Wright.  This was, I'm eighty, so this was a long time ago, but I still remember their names.  And whenever we changed classes, for some reason, Naomi would find a way to get close to me and then elbow me, like that.  And I tried to stay away from her, I really did, because it hurt.  And I did not want to get in a fight, because I knew they were going to send me home if I did.  That was the punishment; you got sent home for whatever number of days.  So, (laughter) finally she did it just before we went into our biology class.  And I said to her, "If you hit me again, I'm going to kick your ass."  And so just before we went into biology class, she did it again.  So I said, "Do you remember what I told you?"  She said, "Yes, I remember what you told me."  So, she went to the blackboard and stooped over.  And I went to the other side of the room, the other end of the room, so I could get a running start.  And I did exactly what I told her I was going to do.  And of course, Professor Butler [Henry H. Butler], that's who we called the principal, Professor Butler--
Speaker 1: So was the high school named for him?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, it was named for him.  And sure enough, he sent me home.  And I told Mama [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] what had happened, and she went down, as she always did.  Because she told me not to ever start anything, but if anything, anybody ever makes you--whenever they hit you or they do something to you, then you have to defend yourself.  That's what Mama always taught me.  And so I told her that I was defending--I told her exactly what happened.  So she went down to talk with Professor Butler, and I can't tell you what she said.  But he understood that she was not going to endure or--that's not a good word--she was not going to allow me to be sent home for protecting myself.  And so he let me back in school.  But that happened several times.  I had a new bicycle that my mother, oh, just went through all kinds of turmoil to get, and paid for it on time, you know, an installment here, an installment there.  I think the bike didn't cost but twenty-six dollars, but that was a lot of money when you're making two--she might have been making four dollars a week by then.  That was a lot of money.  And of course, the people were just so ugly.  They said, "Well, we're going to let you have this bicycle, but if you miss a payment, it's going to come back."  I mean that's the kind of--I remember another occasion when my mother and I were in Florence, when we went to Florence, South Carolina, which was twenty-four miles from Hartsville [South Carolina].  It was like we were going to New York [New York], because we went to Florence.  I mean, that was a really big deal.  So we went to Florence, Mama and I.  We always had a car.  I don't know how we afforded a car, but we were always--as long as I can remember, we had a Chevrolet.  So we drove over to Florence, and Mama being as fair as she was, went over to get a hot dog from a place that they had in the dime store.  And she brought it back and gave me half, and she ate the other half.  And I said, "Mama, that tastes good."  You know, and she said, "Well, go over there and get another one."  And I went over and they said, "Well, we don't serve colored people here."  So, memories?  Those are some of the things that I remember of her.
Story_ID: 645529
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name--what--was Butler High School [Hartsville, South Carolina] the name of the whole school from beginning to--through high school?
Speaker 2: Butler Elementary [Butler Elementary School, Hartsville, South Carolina] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Butler--
Speaker 2: --and Butler High.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you started there--how old were you when you started school?
Speaker 2: I was six years old.
Speaker 1: That's 1936 then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so I take it, I take it for granted you probably were a good student.  Is that, is this true?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm going to tell you about that.  I had the best grades of any student at graduation.  But the preacher's wife [sic.], the black preacher's wife, whose name was Mary Ella Young, I'll never forget it, also had good grades, but not as good as mine.  And so, there was a discussion about who should be valedictorian.  And although I had the better grades, they gave her valedictorian and gave me salutatorian.
Speaker 1: Now, why do you suppose that's true?
Speaker 2: Because she was the preacher's wife.
Speaker 1: So, it was a class distinction?
Speaker 2: She was, it was a class thing.  She was in the upper class, and my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] and father [Junius Reed] had nothing.  But someone--and I think it was my home economics teacher, somehow got it changed on my record.  So when I went to South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], I was, I was called, I was referred to as the valedictorian, I, it was in writing, that I was the valedictorian of Butler High School, of my class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, you like speech, we know that.  But what were your--did you have any other favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: English, I loved English.  I hated math, still hate math, because I never understood it, and barely got through it in college, although, believe it or not, in graduate school [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], my minor was statistics.  But few people realize that there is hardly any, any relationship between math and statistics.  But I minored in test and measurements, I'll put it that way, which required a lot of statistics.  But--
Speaker 1: You're actually doing trigonometry or something in statistics, aren't you?  I mean, it's really--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have to.
Speaker 1: You would have had to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, I would have had to take that.  And I'm not sure I didn't.  But if I did, it was, it was terrible.  I hated math, and I hated even worse history.  Harrison [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] loves history, and he knows everything about who did what and when.  And it's amazing to me that he can talk about these little things.  I said, "Surely, you didn't learn that in college or in a class anywhere."  But he just, you just sort of are drawn to those things that you care about, and I am drawn to English or language.  When I see something on television, the first thing that I listen to is how is the person speaking?  Is he using proper nouns or proper parts of speech, as we used to call them?  And it's unfortunate that we have people on television who murder the English language, language.  And it's so unfortunate, because there are people out there, there are children out there who are listening to them.  And I have called the paper about that, or called the television station about that.  And of course they say, "Yes, we're sorry."  They don't even acknowledge that they've done it.  But--
Speaker 1: But it irritates you to the extent that you actually call them?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, I really did, because I think it's very important.  Because my grandbaby is listening to this, and so are other people's grandbabies.  And that's where, that's where they get much of their, many of their habits from, from television.  Because they look at that more than they do anything else.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean that is the, that is the favorite pastime of most adults and children.
Story_ID: 645530
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you, did you have a mentor or a favorite teacher in school?
Speaker 2: I really didn't.  I wish I had, but I didn't.  There were teachers that I liked better than others, but I never had anyone to tell me about college.  I never had anyone to tell me about how to make it in life, or you should do this and you should do that.  It was all about schoolwork.  I don't remember a single person that I can point to as one who took a very special interest in me; I don't.
Speaker 1: So when it came time for college, I mean when you were finishing Butler High School [Hartsville, South Carolina], what were your prospects?  No one helped--did anybody help you get--?
Speaker 2: I had a girlfriend who lived across the street from me.  Her name was Hallie Q. Jackson, Hallie Q. (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Named after Hallie Q. Brown [Hallie Quinn Brown], right?
Speaker 2: Jackson.  Like Hallie Q. Brown, that's right.	 I didn't know anybody else was named that.  But anyway, Hallie Q.'s brothers and sister, I think she only had one sister.  They were all college oriented.  I don't know how it happened, but it did.  And since Hallie Q. and I were friends, and she went to State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], then I became interested in college.  And I mentioned it to my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] that, "I want to go to college."  By then my mother--my mother has been, has been--I can't remember the word that I'm thinking of.  But by then my father [Junius Reed], my biological father, had left, and my mother was married again [to Isaac Nicholson].  And I remember saying to her, "I want to go to college."  And she said, "Well, honey, you know, we don't have any money; we just don't."  So I said, "Well, I'll work.  I'll do whatever I need to do to go to college."
Story_ID: 645531
Speaker 1: So we're trying to figure out how you're going to go to college, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yes, yes.  And I had saved a little money, because I used to work when I went to New York to take my brother [Junius Reed].  And I'm trying to remember just how I was able to go.  I know I worked, but the process of getting in and getting a job, I honestly do not remember.  I know that my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] drove me over there to South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  It's about, oh, I'd say eighty miles from Hartsville [South Carolina], and placed me in the dormitory.  But I, I'm sorry, I just don't remember the process.  I just don't remember, you know, the intricacies of what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you were able to go?
Speaker 2: I was able to go.
Speaker 1: So, this is in what?  Forty-five [1945] or '46 [1946]?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I went in '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's see.  That means I was seventeen.  And I don't know why I was, I was seventeen, because I started school at six.  We only went to the eleventh grade at that time, not the twelfth.
Story_ID: 645532
Speaker 1: Now, that's always seemed strange to me.  There's so--I hear so many stories about schools in the South, and the so called colored schools, many only going to the eleventh grade.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: When one more--to add one more year, wouldn't seem like it wouldn't be that difficult to do.  But was that some kind of state constriction on those schools, to prevent, you know, numbers of blacks from graduating from high school?  I mean I don't know.
Speaker 2: No, we graduated; we had graduation.  And the twelfth grade was added the year after I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1947 [from Butler High School, Hartsville, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: But to be considered a high school graduate in South Carolina, wouldn't you need twelve years?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.  I had, I had my diploma the same as--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as everybody else who went to the twelfth grade.  They gave me a diploma.  And of course I went to college [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], and I did not have to take, you know, makeup courses or anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because the eleventh grade was fairly common during those days.
Speaker 1: Even with the white school students?
Speaker 2: Now, to be honest with you, I don't know about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just thinking.  I keep wondering that something must be wrong if the black students are only allowed to go to the eleventh grade.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I've never heard of another school, you know, any other kinds of schools doing that, going to the eleventh.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.  Well, I honestly don't know whether the white schools went to the twelfth.  My guess was that they only went to the eleventh also.  That would be my best guess, but I don't know.
Speaker 1: But you got a diploma at graduation?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had the whole--you know, the speeches and people coming to graduation.  And the valedictorian said her speech, and the salutatorian said her speech, and so forth.  So, it was quite a big thing.  And of course then, you know, our principal [Henry H. Butler] handed out the diplomas and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So yes, it was, it was a legitimate graduation.
Speaker 1: All right, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 645533
Speaker 1: What was your impression of South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina]?  Now this is a black school [HBCU], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A state supported black school in South Carolina (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  I loved it.  I think my college days were probably some of the best days of my life.  I loved every minute of it.  And I do remember some of my teachers there.  My drama teacher was William Bennett [ph.].  And had I thought there was a place for blacks in drama, I would have majored in that.  I did major--I did take a minor in it, at the master's [degree] and doctoral levels.   But that was my favorite.  I was, I got the best actress award for four years in a row at South Carolina State.
Speaker 1: What plays were you in, and what roles?
Speaker 2: Oh, gracious.  Let's see, what was my favorite play?  Tennessee Williams.
Speaker 1: 'The Glass Menagerie'?
Speaker 2: 'The Glass Menagerie.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'The Glass Menagerie' was one of them.  But there was another one that was even more famous than that, where--it's on Broadway now, I believe.
Speaker 1: Not 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' [Tennessee Williams]?
Speaker 2: No, not that.
Speaker 1: 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun']?
Speaker 2: 'Raisin in the Sun.'  No, no, that's Lorraine Hansberry.
Speaker 1: Is it another Tennessee Williams play?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's another Tennessee Williams play.
Speaker 1: 'Streetcar Named Desire' ['A Streetcar Named Desire']?
Speaker 2: No, that's not it.
Speaker 1: I think that's all I know.  I'm out of (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) But my drama teacher was especially fond of Tennessee Williams, and so most of the plays that he conducted were Tennessee Williams plays.  And I just cannot think of the other one to save my life.  By the way, my English teacher, I mean my drama teacher, went to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia].  I didn't know about Virginia Union then, being in South Carolina.  But he did go to Virginia Union, and I have seen him since we have lived here.  As a matter of fact, I was speaking at Virginia Union and he was in the audience.  And of course I looked at him, and he was sort of bowing his head.  Because, when I remember speaking, when I was speaking at Norfolk State [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], I would always look at him and he would tell me something that I wasn't doing right.  He would say for example (whispering), "Lower your pitch.  Lower your pitch."  I remember him doing that.  But when I spoke at Union, he said, "You're, you're okay.  You're okay."  But that was my favorite subject, drama.
Story_ID: 645534
Speaker 1: You just didn't think that you could have a career in drama (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no.  And I knew that I had to, I had to make some money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, because I owed money to the school [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  I had to make a living, because at that time I had no other source of income.  So I could not go into a field where the income was suspect.
Speaker 1: Sort of--yeah.
Speaker 2: Or, or, or--
Speaker 1: Not dependable.
Speaker 2: That's right, was undependable.  So I did not go into drama.  But--
Speaker 1: Had you gone in, you would have been in the same generation of people with, you know, all the big stars in New York [New York], you know, the Negro Ensemble Company group [NEC] and, you know, some of the others, you know, [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis and [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee.
Speaker 2: But I didn't even know about those.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't know about those.  I knew about Lena Horne, but, you know, who's going to be a Lena Horne?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So, it's from the movies that you really saw--?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  And there were very, very, very, few black movies.  I think the only one that I saw before I grew up was, what was that first movie that blacks--?
Speaker 1: 'Green Pastures' ['The Green Pastures'], or--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't that.
Speaker 1: 'Cabin in the Sky'?
Speaker 2: 'Cabin in the Sky.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cabin in the Sky.'
Speaker 1: And Lena Horne was in that.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  And that was the only movie I remember having seen featuring a black anything, woman or man.  And so as far as I was concerned, that was just not something I could afford to do.
Story_ID: 645535
Speaker 1: So South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], four years.  Did--were you one of the top students in your class there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated cum laude.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm not surprised.
Speaker 2: Not magna or summa, but just cum laude (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: But I have been invited back to speak there, and I still receive information from South Carolina State.  And I try to support them, you know, financially, but I rarely go there anymore.  But my sister went there for two years, and my brother went to Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] while I was working at Claflin, as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Is this your older brother?
Speaker 2: No, my younger.
Speaker 1: Your younger brother, okay.
Speaker 2: I have a younger brother whose name also is Junius [Junius Reed].  And that's the one that I used to take to New York to see my father [Junius Reed], and who became, or who was my father's favorite child.  And when my father became disabled, my brother had him to come and stay; my father to come and stay with him in Atlanta [Georgia].  And I said, "Well, June, you know how I feel about Daddy.  So, whatever you want to do, that's fine with me.  But don't expect any help from me."  And I meant it.
Story_ID: 645536
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well we were just talking about South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], and you said your favorite teacher was a drama teacher.  Were there any other teachers that really stood out there, that you liked?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My English teacher was Mrs. Rosa Harris [ph.]. That was her name.  And I remember that we were so happy that she went away somewhere and got a master's degree.  Because most of our college teachers only had a B.S. degree, even in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].  And when Mrs. Harris got a master's degree, we thought that was quite an accomplishment.  But she was one of my favorite teachers.  And Mr.--I mean my drama teacher, William--what did I say his last name was?
Speaker 1: Bennett.
Speaker 2: Bennett.  William Bennett [ph.], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, so, what was your major?  What did you major in?
Speaker 2: Business administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Business administration.
Speaker 1: So you were thinking about how you could turn that degree into some cash, right? Or, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes, of course.  But do you know what?  There were no black accountants that I knew.  I was never told about a black accountant.  I wanted to be a secretary, and that's what I wound up being, a secretary, making eighteen hundred dollars a year.  That's what I did.  My first job was at South Carolina State, where I worked for the dean of the school of industrial arts.  I stayed there until someone from Washington came through looking for African American graduates that they could employ in the government.  So I left South Carolina State and went to Washington, D.C. and worked for the Veterans Administration [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] for about two years.
Story_ID: 645537
Speaker 1: So, this is Washington, D.C.  Is this the first time you really had been to a bigger, big city?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Like--yeah.
Speaker 2: Other than Florence, South Carolina (laughter).  Well, of course, I had been to New York.  I take that back.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Because I'd been to New York, you know, during my earlier years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is true.
Speaker 2: Taking my brother, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what a dramatic difference that must have been, to go from the country to New York and back?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  It was frightening.  It was frightening, because my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson]--I mean my father [Junius Reed] was not living in the best of housing.  And you know, people were getting shot; kids were playing in the street.  And I remember being on the second floor, and my father only had this one room, one room in this apart- in this apartment building.  And he and his wife lived in that one room, and June [Junius Reed] and I slept on the floor.  And during the day I heard these cars screeching, and I looked out the window and June was right in the middle of the street.  And these cars came to a screeching halt to keep from hitting him.  He was four or five, and I had left him down there.  I was a child myself.  I'm eleven years older than he, so I was fifteen or sixteen.  And oh, gracious.  Now, I should have listed that among the things that I remember.
Story_ID: 645538
Speaker 1: So you were talking about the incident where your brother [Junius Reed] was--
Speaker 2: Was four (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) was four and was in--
Speaker 2: Was almost run down in New York.  And, oh, my goodness, I don't know what I would have done had those cars not come to a screeching halt.  And I don't remember allowing him to be out there alone ever again.  Now when he was older, there was a time that I went to New York to work during the summer, and I think I was in college [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  Oh yes, I was in college then.  And I went to live with my uncle, Uncle Lawrence [Lawrence Reed], the one that I told you dressed so well (unclear).  But my father [Junius Reed] asked him to take us, or to take me.  And I lived with him in Far Rockaway, New York [Queens, New York] for a summer.  But then I got a job working for a couple who were, who lived not far away.  I don't remember the place they lived in, what it was called.  But that was quite an experience, too.  Because the woman was a stay at home mom, and the guy worked.  They had one child, and I was the, I was there to take care of the child, to do the cooking.  I did everything; the cleaning, the laundry, everything, even though I was only fifteen or sixteen or seventeen.  I don't remember how old, but I was still in college.  And she was a very mean spirited person.  He was just the opposite.  But I remember her telling me that her mother never should have married this black man.  I don't know how we got into that conversation, but I remember that part of it, that her mother never should have married this black man.  And I said--
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  Who are you talking about now?
Speaker 2: I'm talking about the people that I worked for in New York.
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: It was a couple.
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I don't remember their names.  It was only for a brief period.  But I remember her telling me that.  And I don't know what my response was, but it was not, it was not anything that would allow me to make me lose my job, because I knew I had to have a job.  But other than that, the job was uneventful.  I mean, there was nothing unusual to go on, except they had me work.  I would start at seven in the morning.  And if I got to bed by ten [o'clock], I was lucky.  She had me to do everything from turning the mattress over and spray it, to making the beds and scrubbing the floors.  And I think she just saw me as a person who could get her house clean, and I could.  But I remember that she asked me, "Can you iron" when I was applying for the job.  "Can you iron?"  And by the way, I got this job through an employment agency, because I remember having to pay them.  And they sent me out to various places, and I chose this place.  And she said, "Can you iron?"  And I said, "Yes.  As a matter of fact, I ironed the dress that I'm wearing."  And it was a yellow dress, very fitted here, and just, you know, with a very wide, not pleated, but wide flared skirt.  So she said, "Well, that looks very nice.  So I think you can, you can help me."  And I think they gave me seventeen dollars a week.  But that was a lot, because school did not cost that much.  And with my working, I was able to, I was able to make it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that was a little side trip to, back to New York but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 645539
Speaker 1: We had you in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] now working for the VA administration.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: The Veterans Administration [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And was it there that you decided to go back to school?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.
Speaker 1: So it's been--we're about in 1954 now I guess, at the VA.
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so.  Well, when I left there, I had not been married.  I left there and came back thinking that my first husband would marry me.  I met him when he was on the faculty of the law school which was still at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University Orangeburg, South Carolina].  They've integrated it now, so they only have one law school.  But at that time, they had a law school at South Carolina State.  And he was a member of the staff there, and I was a student working in the law school.  And we started going together, and we got married eventually; we got married.  But that was in 1961, I believe it was.  So by then I had gotten, I had gotten a master's, at least.  And yeah, a doctorate also.  Because I received a doctorate, also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, let's go through that then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now you went to, you got your master's degree from Indiana University?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: In Bloomington [Indiana].  Okay, and then--
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: That's '54 [1954], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, that sounds right.
Speaker 1: And then it says from '54 [1954] to '56 [1956], you were the dean of women at Albany State College [Albany State University, Albany, Georgia].
Speaker 2: That's right, in Georgia.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Dean of women there for what?  Two years?  Was it two years?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am, two years.  Yeah, Albany State.  And you were there when the--were you there when the Albany movement--you know--?
Speaker 2: No, I was not there then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had been part of the movement though at some time when I was in South Carolina.  I think I was working--oh, I know.  I was working at Claflin College [sic. Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Right.  Now that's '56 [1956] to '62 [1962], okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  I worked there before and after I went to Indiana for a doctorate.  As a matter of fact, the way I was able to go back to Indiana for a doctorate was that the Danforth Foundation [St. Louis, Missouri] was looking for African Americans who were eligible to go to graduate school and get a doctorate.  And they came through, came to Claflin; and I applied and I, I was accepted.
Story_ID: 645540
Speaker 1: Now, you, you served as dean of women at Albany [Albany State College; Albany State University, Albany, Georgia], and then dean of students at Claflin College [sic. Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What were the--did anything eventful happen at those two?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  Let's see.  Dean of women at Albany State, I was there for I think a year or two.  And I was married at the time that I was there.  But my husband was not really concerned that I was, whether I was at home or not.  And I wasn't too concerned about whether I was at home or not either (laughter.)  We had a very unusual relationship, a very unusual marriage.  He was a very smart person, highly intelligent.  But he had no ambition whatsoever.  And so, although he graduated from Southern University [Southern University Law School; Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] with a law degree, he never practiced.  If he did, it must have been in much later years.
Speaker 1: But he taught at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: He taught at South Carolina State law school. That's where we met.  And he was there when we got married.  And then we moved into an apartment and--oh, I became, I became embarrassed when he and his lawyer friends would talk about things that I had no knowledge of.  And I think that he did it intentionally, I really do.  Because there were some things that I could do that he couldn't do.  So when he and his friends got together, he just sort of paid me back for speaking, or whatever else I was doing.  I was a secretary.  I was secretary for the assistant superintendent for African Americans--for colored--in Orangeburg, South Carolina.  And as I said, I wasn't making any money.  So, I decided that I can really do better than this.  And so I went back to, I went back to college and got a master's [from Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana].  And that seemed easy enough.  I stayed there the whole while.  I did not go in spurts.  I went there and stayed for a whole year to get a master's [degree].  And then I came back and worked at Claflin.  Then when Claflin--when Danforth came through, they paid my way to graduate school, the Danforth Foundation [St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Plus, they gave me two hundred dollars a month in cash.  So, I was then able--not only were they paying my way, but I was able then to help my brother and my sister, who were also in college at the time.  I was able to send them--one went to South Carolina State, the other went to Claflin.  So, I was able to help him through.
Story_ID: 645541
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your dissertation at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].  What did you--?
Speaker 2: Yes, let's see.  What was the title of my dissertation?  I'm sure it was more formal than this.  But I compared the achievements of students who remained in college and the persons who left college before graduating.  In other words, I compared the achievements of academicians I probably called it, and non--no, of leavers--the achievements of leavers and non-leavers of baccalaureate college, of undergraduate college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what I wanted to do was to find out whether those persons who left did better financially than those who stayed on.  Because most people who left college, left because they were going to get a job.  There was a good job waiting for them, and so they just left to take that job.  And so, I compared their--of course the questionnaire was much longer than this.  But the major thing that I wanted to find out was whether they were better off financially, the people who left, than the people who finally graduated.  And do you know what I found?  That there was no difference; that there was no--
Speaker 1: Now, that's surprising, yeah.
Speaker 2: --difference in the achievements of students, not African Americans, but students, black and white, who left college to get a job and those who finished college to get a job.  I didn't want to report that, but that's what the data showed.
Speaker 1: Do you think that's still true?
Speaker 2: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  What did you just ask her?  I couldn't hear that.
Speaker 1: Do I think it's still true that those who leave college are--
Speaker 2: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  Before they finish?
Speaker 1: Before they finish, do they achieve as much as those who stay on to graduate?
Speaker 2: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  Seems to me they had to wait a good bit of time.
Speaker 1: Wait--
Speaker 2: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're really not allowed to have a third conversation (laughter).
Speaker 2: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  Huh?
Speaker 1: We're really not allowed to have a third conversation going on.
Speaker 2: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Sometimes the interviewee will ask the person who's observing for, you know, some fact.  But that's about it, you know.
Speaker 2: All right.  No, I believe that, I believe that it is better to finish.  Because then you have more choices.  You can go into graduate school, whereas you couldn't do that if you didn't finish college.  Or, you can get a better job.  I think that college graduates generally earn more than non-college graduates.  I believe that's true (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think that--yeah, I think that's really statistically true now.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But things have really changed a lot since the '60s [1960s], I guess.
Speaker 2: That's right.  It was in '60 [1960] that I did this, and I found no difference.  But I think that there is a difference now, because high school has even become more important.  You know, if you haven't finished high school--and people look at your, at your background a lot more than they did then, for whatever reason.  But high school graduates, I mean non-high school graduates are having a problem, having problems getting jobs now.  And it's even more so for non-college graduates, as compared to their peers who do have a degree.
Story_ID: 645542
Speaker 1: Yeah, were there, were there any outstanding memories of Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], either, either teachers, students or something that happened there that might be, you know?
Speaker 2: There was not a lot going on with Indiana University.  I didn't, I didn't look for any enjoyment, and I didn't find any.  I enjoyed my classes, I enjoyed the few people that I palled around with.  But I don't remember anything special that went on at Indiana University.  The one thing that happened to me was that during the time I was seeking a graduate school, I wrote to many colleges and universities that I thought I might be able to get into, including Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], da da da da da, you name, I applied.  And some accepted me, and some didn't.  Well, the one thing that attracted me to Indiana University is that the president answered my letter, or at least he signed it.  He probably had people, you know, who wrote the letter and da da da, and just--you know, he did it on a-- but he signed the letter, my acceptance letter.  And I said that's something very special, because nobody else had done that.  Now, I never met him after I got there, but--
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  He was the same president, wasn't he?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah, Herman Bell [sic. Herman B Wells], he was the same president.  And, but I, and I never met him after I got there.  But he signed my acceptance letter; and that's what attracted me to Indiana.
Story_ID: 645543
Speaker 1: After Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] you went, you got a job at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went back to Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Oh, you went back to Cl- --
Speaker 2: I went back to Claflin.
Speaker 1: --Claflin, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Because that was one of the requirements of the Danforth Foundation [St. Louis, Missouri], that you had to return to the school from which they selected you for at least two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you serve in the same post?
Speaker 2: No.  That's when they made me, I think, dean of students, dean of student services.
Story_ID: 645544
Speaker 1: Was the Civil Rights Movement boiling up in South Carolina at--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  And because I was at a private school [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], then I could participate in the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Now explain the dynamic of that, so that people understand it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  People who worked at the state could and would be fired if they participated in the Civil Rights Movement.  But since I was working at a private school, I could participate without fear.  One of the things that I did, we decided, we, meaning those of us who either were not working or did not fear being fired--being hurt or fired, I should say, by the, by our employers--decided that we were going to integrate the federal health service center, which was located in downtown Orangeburg [South Carolina].  Now, here is a federally funded program that had one side for whites and another room for African Americans, or colored.  So, my group and I decided that we were going to integrate that place.  And I was chosen as the one to go in and ask for service.  So I went in, and I asked for something that I knew they did not offer, like a flu shot or something.  And they said, "Well, we don't offer that here."  So, I said, "All right, well, I'll just wait, because my ride is to pick me up in about an hour."  So (laughter) then I went and sat in the white sitting room.  And the lady said, "Oh, you're to sit over here in the colored waiting room."  And I said, "Oh, I'm very comfortable here," and I sat.  And so I could hear them whispering among themselves, the nurses, whispering among themselves.  And then a doctor came in, and very nicely said, "Would you mind sitting over here?  This is the place that we have especially for you."  And I said, "No, I'm comfortable here.  But thank you very much."  And then the police came in.  I'm sure I'm going to get arrested, because that's what I'm there for, so that we would have a case.  Well, the police came in, policeman came, just one.  He came in and talked with the nurses and the doctor, and looked at me.  And I'm waiting for him to come and arrest me.  He just went out.  So, I'm sitting there wondering, well, what is going to happen?  Because I thought maybe he thought that he needed another person, you know.  He never came back.  I sat for an hour or more.  And when nothing happened and they went on back to work, you know, doing whatever they were doing, I just got up and, you know, hailed my ride to come on, and we went back.  The next month, we read in the paper that the federal health department was now integrated.  So, they didn't do anything to me, but they did integrate.
Story_ID: 645545
Speaker 1: Do you imagine that they were just trying to go along with local custom as long as they dared to, or?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think exactly that, yes.  That they had to deal with other people who were coming there, but then as a federal agency, they were not going to lose money because the white people didn't come.  So, you know, why not integrate?  I think my presence just gave them the idea.  But I was, I was so disappointed, because I was ready to go to jail (laughter).  I wanted to go to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was your group?  Was this an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] group, a CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] group, or--?
Speaker 2: It was, it was primarily the NAACP, primarily.  But then there were at least two other people who were not affiliated with the NAACP, or at least they were not strong members of the--nor was I; I was not a strong member. I paid my dues, but I didn't go down, you know, to their meetings or whatever.  But when they asked if there was somebody who would be willing to do this, I said, "Well, I'll do it," because I knew that I was at Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], and nothing would happen.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But yes, it was primarily the NAACP.
Story_ID: 645546
Speaker 1: What happened that you, that brought you to Pri- to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], what--?
Speaker 2: Well, it really was a dare.  I used to take Psychology--the American psychology journal [The American Journal of Psychology].  And in the back they had a list of employment opportunities.  And Princeton, the Educational Testing Service, had Princeton listed.  And at the bottom it said, "We are an equal opportunity employer."  I picked up the phone and called and said, "My name is Lucy Reed Cutliff [HistoryMaker Lucy R. Wilson]," as it was then, "I have a doctorate from Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] in guidance and counseling, and I would like to apply for the job.  Tell me to whom I am to write."  And they told me, and I wrote.  The next thing I knew, they were calling me to come in for an interview, which I did; hat, gloves, and all.  Because that's what I had been taught during my college days, that that's how you are to dress to go for an interview.  Everybody else was in slacks and, you know, very casual clothes.  And here I am in a hat, gloves, suit, and--
Speaker 1: You looked like Jackie Kennedy [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis] almost (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter).
Speaker 1: In that area, the gloves and the--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, well, I know I looked different, that's for sure.  And I knew how to, I'd learned how to stoop from the knees instead of bending over to pick up whatever.  And I made sure that I dropped something on the floor, so that I would have to stoop down and show them that I knew how to stoop.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Rather than bending over.
Story_ID: 645547
Speaker 1: This raises a question now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You're, you know, not to take South Carolina lightly.  But you went to a country school in the country.  But have a very, you know, polished demeanor.  How did, how was that--how did you get that manner?  Who taught you that?
Speaker 2: I was taught that by my English teacher, Miss Rosa Harris [ph.], my English teacher, as well as, we call him Mr. Bill [ph.], Mr. Bill.  And it was just something that--we didn't have a class in how to act or how to present yourself, or how to dress or how to speak, or anything like that.  We did not have a class in the culture.  But it was just something that you learned in a black school.  I probably never would have learned that had I gone to a white school.  But there, they knew that we were from the country, and that we needed to know things like that.  Because we came there stooping over, you know, to pick up paper.  We came there saying, "I ain't," and, "I is."  And so it was those little things that they, that they emphasized to us.  "Be sure to wear your hat and your gloves when you're going for an interview."  I can tell you that eventually that made me a laughing stock, not at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], but later I went to Lincoln High School in Sumter, South Carolina, and every day I would wear a hat and gloves to my secretarial position. And people thought that that was the funniest thing they've ever seen, which it was.  You know, you're in Sumter, South Carolina, it's hot, and you're going to work with a hat on, and gloves, like you were going to church.  So, you know, they laughed.  And it was funny, I'm sure.  I probably would have done the same thing, until I learned better.  And you know, then I learned, "When in Rome, do as Rome."
Speaker 1: There are pictures, there are newsreels of the Civil Rights Movement where students are being arrested at lunch counters.  And the women, the black women from the colleges, Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and other places, are dressed in a hat and gloves.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And they, they're getting in a paddy wagon dressed with their gloves on.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  Well, we were taught that.  We were taught that on special occasions, or whenever you are in, you know, you're going to work, if you're in a setting such as ETS [Educational Testing Service], you, of course, you wear your hat and your gloves.  And that's what I did.
Story_ID: 645548
Speaker 1: How was it at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]?  Was it, was it--?
Speaker 2: At Princeton, it was like going to a book party.  By that, I mean their casual conversation was about, "What's the latest book that you read?  What do you think about the new president, I mean the president's new policy?"  We never talked about casual things.  We never talked about who's going to the beach, or what are you going to do for the weekend?  Any of those things.  We just never talked about casual things.  It was all professional, all the way.  And I thought I would go out of my mind.  The only thing that saved me was that there was a girl, Alice Irby, I'll never forget her name, a white girl from North Carolina who was there at the same time I was.  She had the same feelings about ETS [Educational Testing Service] as I did.  And so we would get together and talk about how crazy these people were, these educated people were.  And she would come to my house, I would go to her house.  She'd been married before, she had a little girl.  And, oh, I'll never forget, she gave me a birthday party.  And she told me to come at a certain time, which I did.  And the woman who was helping her said, "I'm glad you didn't come early, because Alice had a fit."  And I said, "About what?"  She said, "Because the bakery had sent them chocolate muffins."  She was serving muffins, you know, to the guests.  And I said, "Well, what's wrong with chocolate muffins?"  She said, "She thought it would insult you."  I said, "That's my favorite dish," (laughter) you know, "if I'm going to be eating chocolate.  A chocolate muffin is fine."  But that, that was Alice.  And we kept in touch for a long time after I left.  Let's see, where did I go?  I'm still--
Speaker 1: You went to--
Speaker 2: To Lincoln [Lincoln High School, Sumter, South Carolina]?
Speaker 1: No, you went to Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], I believe.
Speaker 2: To Southern?  No.
Speaker 1: I believe this is '64 [1964].  Are we at '64 [1964]? Let's see.  Maybe, maybe you were there--it says you were an assistant program director of guidance services--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at Princeton from '62 [1962] to '67 [1967].  Well, something's got to be off 'cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they've got you here at Southern--
Speaker 2: No, not--
Speaker 1: --too.  I don't understand--
Speaker 2: I was at Southern for two, at least two years.  So, and I was not at Princeton for five years.  I was at Princeton for two years.  So there's something wrong there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: Is that my typing?  I mean is that the vitae I gave you?
Speaker 1: No, this is something prepared in the office from that, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, '62 [1962], if you were at Princeton in '62 [1962], I guess you left in '64 [1964]? Is that it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: And then I went to Southern.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That makes sense.
Speaker 2: And I, I stayed at Southern until '67 [1967], and that's when Harrison [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] and I got married.
Story_ID: 645549
Speaker 1: Now what, how did you meet Harrison [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson]?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a mutual friend whose name was Kirk, I mean, his last name was Kirk.
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  Bob.
Speaker 2: Bob Kirk.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Bob Kirk, who also was at Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] when both Harrison and I were there.  I did not know Harrison at Indiana, except my girlfriend, who went to church every Sunday--I did not.  But she went to church every Sunday, and she came back one day and she was, I mean almost in a sweat, telling me about this good looking guy that she saw at church.  "Honey, he has this grey spot in the back of his head.  And he is a fine thang."  That's how we used to talk.  So I said, "Well, I want to go and see him."  So, I went to church with her the next Sunday, and there was this fine thang.  I said, "Well, he is handsome, Ruth."  Her name was Ruth Taylor [ph.].  She was working on a doctorate also, my best friend, my oldest child's godmother, as a matter of fact; she was before she died.  And I said, "He is fine, all right."  So I went back and talked about this guy that I had seen at church.  I don't know if I remembered his name or not.  But whoever I told about him said, "Well, I tell you.  There's no need of Ruth getting interested in him, or you either, because he is a family man.  He is a family man."  I remember those words to this day.  And I didn't, I was not really interested in him, but my girlfriend was.  Oh, she thought he was just divine.  And I don't remember seeing him again until I was at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And Kirk was working at Southern also, Bob Kirk, who was Harrison's best friend when they were at IU.
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  We were all classmates, as a matter of fact.  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to say anything.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Well, anyway, by 1967, I had divorced my first husband.  I had a little girl [Jennifer Wilson].  We had a little girl together, my first husband and I.  And I had gone to Idaho to get a divorce, because I did not want to wait for the year that I would be required to wait in South Carolina to get a divorce.  So I sold my car, I took my child, and I went to Idaho.  I communicated with a--he was not a lawyer, but he was a psychologist there.  His name had been listed in the psychology journal [The American Journal of Psychology].  And I called him and told him my credentials.  I told him that I was thinking of moving to Idaho, and did he have--could I be considered for the job that he had advertised in the psychology journal?  And he said, "Well, you sound just like the person I've been looking for."  And I said, "Well, I think I am."  So he said, "Sure."  He said, "When are you coming?"  I said, "I will be there," oh, I believe it was in August of '61 [1961], '62 [1962] sometime.
Speaker 1: It was '64 [1964], I think.
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Story_ID: 645550
Speaker 1: So, here we are at Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] in Scotlandville, Louisiana, right?
Speaker 2: No, Baton Rouge [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's--
Speaker 2: Baton Rouge (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) outside of Baton Rouge, in Scotlandville, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  Right, right.  And no, we're still in Idaho.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, you're still--you haven't decided.
Speaker 2: We're still in Idaho because I'm there to get a divorce.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And I had my baby [Jennifer Wilson] with me.  Well, I went into this psychologist's office on the day of the day, the appointed day that I was to begin.  And he said, "Well, the job has been taken."  I said, "That can't be."  I said, "I have come all the way out here for this job.  It's the only source of, possible source of income that I have."  He said, "Well, I'm sorry, but the job has been taken."  So at that point, I don't know what I'm going to do.  I may have two hundred dollars left.  I'm in a motel, I have a child.  I have left my husband; I'm out there for a divorce.  I've contacted the divorce lawyer.
Speaker 1: So is this Boise, Idaho?
Speaker 2: No, this was--I can't remember.
Speaker 1: That's all right.
Story_ID: 645551
Speaker 1: I can't remember the name of the place, never been there before or since.  But anyway, he didn't hire me.  And when I got home I said, "Well, I'm just going to ask him."  And I called him and I said, "Dr.," whatever his name was, "I'm not going to even think about suing you, because I don't have the money to do it.  But I need, just for my own satisfaction, I need to know whether or not you refused to hire me because I am black, or because there was something wrong with the way I looked, or what?"  And he said, "Well, I'll be very honest with you, Dr. Cutliff [HistoryMaker Lucy R. Wilson]," was my name, "it's because you are half an American."  He said, "If I were to hire you, I would lose half of my clientele within a week."  And I said, "Well, I understand that, I understand that."  And I began looking for a job in the dime store; I was going to be a clerk.  And suddenly the phone rang out of nowhere, and it was Ed Johnson [Edward E. Johnson] who was head of the psychology department at Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And he said, "We got your number from your husband."  He didn't know I was out there to get a divorce.  I said, "Yes?"  And he said, "We have an opening at Southern University for a professor," not--either a professor or an associate professor of psychology.  I've forgotten which.  And he said, "Would you be interested?"  Well, I didn't want him to know how hard up I was for a job.  So I told him that there was another firm that wanted to interview--that I was interviewing with.  And I said, "They want me to consider working for them within the next month.  So if Southern wants me, then I will have to come right away.  Otherwise, I'll be obligated to this other guy."  Well, that was not true.  I simply wanted them to move the date back when they would hire me, because I was out of money; I was running out of money.  So he said, "Well, I'll check with the dean and I'll call you back."  And he did, within the hour.  And the dean, he said that the dean told him that it was fine for me to come right away, and I did.  And that's how I got to Southern.  And of course, I had nowhere to live, so I lived with Ed and his family.  Jennifer [Wilson's daughter, Jennifer Wilson] and I took a room with Ed and his family for about three weeks until I could earn a check.  Well, no, they paid me upfront, they paid me upfront.  And so, I stayed there until '67 [1967].

Speaker 1: Bob Kirk, who was Harrison's [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] best friend, also worked at Southern [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  He was working there before I went.  And his wife and I became very good friends, Aravella [Aravella Whitlow Kirk].  In the meantime, Harrison's wife of many years [Anna Wilson] died and left him with four children, four boys.  And Kirk told me that Harrison's wife had passed.  I had never met her.  And so I wrote him a letter and expressed my sympathy.  I offered my condolences and asked him if he would bring the four boys over, I would have dinner for them.  So he said, "Yes," that he would.  And oh, I went to my girlfriend's house, Gladys Hildrick [ph.], oh, and we just cooked up a storm.  We just cooked everything we could think of for this man and these four boys.  He didn't show up.  He did not show up.  And of course Gladys is saying, "I told you, I told you not to be expecting him."  Because, you know, his wife has only been dead for, oh, several months or so.  So I said, "I was only doing it because I wanted to be, I wanted to show him that there was someone who was thinking about him and these children."  So, anyway I wrote a letter to him.  He didn't write a letter to me to apologize.  I wrote a letter to him and said, "I understand why you did not come.  I'm sure it's very difficult for you during these times, and I hope you will think of another time that you and the boys can come over."  And he called and said that they could come over at a certain time within the next week or two.  And sure enough, they did.  It just so happened that my first husband's family was living in a town--in New Orleans [Louisiana], which was not far from Baton Rouge [Louisiana], as you know.  And they had called to say that they would like to see me, and could they come over?  And I said, "Of course, when would you like to come?"  Well, they chose the same day that Harrison had said he was coming.  So, I said, "Well, come over for breakfast, and we'll have breakfast."  And I told Harrison to come over for dinner or lunch.  So, as they were going out, Harrison and his four boys were coming in.  So, that was the beginning of our relationship.
Story_ID: 645553
Speaker 1: Anyway, he came the second time with the four boys in tow.  And it was so strange (laughter) that he had them to come in one at a time; one at a time.  First the little one, then the second, then the third, then finally Benji [Benjamin F. Wilson].  And I'm wondering if the guy thinks that I can't count.  You know, I know how to count to four.  I know there's four boys.  Besides, I'd heard that before.  But I had invited him in spite of, or because of, or whatever, of that.  And so we saw each other that time, and maybe three or four times later.  Now, his proposal to me was never, "I love you and I want to marry you."  His proposal was, "I need somebody to help me raise these boys."  And I said, "Well, I'll do it.  I think I'll do it.  But I need to talk with my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson]."  So I sent a picture of him along with his boys' baseball gloves to my mother, and encircled him, "This is Harrison [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson]."  Her response to me was, "Now Lucy [HistoryMaker Lucy R. Wilson], Harrison is a good looking man.  So, you fix yourself up."  Well, I thought I was doing quite well before then.  But the other thing she said was, "I'm going to pray about it."  And I said, "Well, Mom," I said, "try to get an answer from the Lord by Thursday, because that's when he's coming by."  So she said, "Well, I'll do the best I can.  I can't put a timeframe on the Lord, but I'll do the best I can."  So sure enough, Wednesday, or sometime before Thursday, she called and she said, "You know what?  I believe that the Lord sent you here to be a mother to those four little motherless children."  And the rest is history.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  Forty-three years.
Speaker 2: Forty-three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, all right.  We'll get the alternative version later (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But that's good, that's a good, good story.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 645554
Speaker 1: So, you stayed in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] another year or so?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And how did you all--?
Speaker 2: No.  As a matter of fact, I had, I had written a proposal to be, to be implemented that summer, the summer of 1967.  And I knew that if I was going to marry Harrison [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson], that I needed that time, you know, to get packed, to arrange--we had not announced that we were married.  So we were going to live separately, in separate apartments in Tennessee where he was moving, and I was moving with him.  So I had to make all kinds of arrangements to take care of those things I was responsible for that summer; responsible for as related to my job.  And so that, that took up my entire summer.  We were married in August of 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we went to Tennessee, and we did not announce it.  We went to Tennessee, lived in separate apartments; and we did not announce it until October of 1967.
Story_ID: 645555
Speaker 1: So you went there as director of adult services at the Tennessee mental health department [Tennessee Department of Mental Health; Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services] in Nashville [Tennessee].  Is that correct (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: I went there as a professor at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This part is wrong then.
Speaker 2: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  That's another story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So she was--he was assistant to the president at Tennessee State.
Speaker 2: Right, at Tennessee State University.  And I was a professor of psychology at Tennessee State.  But then I was also teaching a class at the Tennessee, I mean at the Nashville, at the Nashville school of the University of Tennessee, the Nashville branch of the University of Tennessee [University of Tennessee at Nashville; Avon Williams Campus, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And that's when they asked me to be, to assume the role of vice president of the Nashville branch.  But I never did, because I left the job to marry and come to, come to Norfolk [Virginia] with Harrison [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's--okay, but you--so, most of the time you spent in Nashville you taught psychology at Tennessee State?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, let's see, half of the time.  I think we were in Tennessee for eight years.  And half of the time, or for at least two years of that time, I was professor of psychology at Tennessee State University and at the University of Tennessee.  My time was divided between those two.  But then I, I was appointed director of adult services for the State of Tennessee, where I worked for several years.
Speaker 1: So when was that?  When were you appointed director?
Speaker 2: Of adult services?  Let's see, I got married in '67 [1967].  That was probably '69 [1969] or '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wait, wait just a minute.  I'm getting Tennessee mixed up with Norfolk.  We came to Norfolk in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I was working as director of adult services when I left.  So I was, I was working for the state department of Tennessee as director of adult services until '67 [1967].  No, that's not right.
Speaker 1: Until, I guess--
Speaker 2: Until I went to Southern [sic.].
Speaker 1: Yeah, in '75 [1975], yeah.
Speaker 2: Because Southern was the next place I went to.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Well--
Speaker 2: Tell me if I'm wrong.  Because what--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the chronology I have is that you left Southern in '67 [1967]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for Tennessee State.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And then you were there until 1975.  But while there, you were director of adult services starting in 1969.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Through '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's it.
Speaker 1: That it--is that it?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, yes.
Story_ID: 645556
Speaker 1: So you all were doing pretty well in Tennessee.  Did you want to leave Tennessee and go to Virginia then?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know, someone asked me that.  "Are you leaving this good job in Tennessee to go to Norfolk [Virginia]?"  I said, "My husband [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] is going to Norfolk as president of Norfolk State [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia].  I'm not going to stay here without him and my children."  I mean the question was an, almost an insult.  You know, why would I do that?  Why wouldn't you go with your husband wherever he's going, if he is the, if he is the, if he is considered the head of the household?  Of course, some women nowadays are considered head of the household, and they expect the husbands to follow them.  But it wasn't that way then.  He was considered head of the household, and we have, in '67 [1967] we have, we have, we have five children.  Our child together was not born until 1969, but we've got five children.  So, I'm not about to leave him with five children.  So the question was asinine at best.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So no question you were going to go?  So--
Speaker 2: Oh, no question.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's a nice way of putting it.
Story_ID: 645557
Speaker 1: Now, had, had you already lined up a job at Old Dominion [Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia] when you arrived or did you have to work on that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no.  Because when they came over to interview Harrison [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson], the chairman of the board and the vice chairman of the board of Norfolk State [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], they invited me to join Harrison as a professor of psychology at Norfolk State, which I did.  That's probably not on my vitae because I only stayed there for a month at the, at the longest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I'm working at Norfolk State.  My husband is the president, and I'm director of guidance and counseling at Norfolk State.  But the people in the guidance and counseling department did not like me at all.  I mean some of the things they said to me were, "Well, don't you know that?  You're supposed to have a doctorate."  And so, I quit.  I quit Norfolk State and said, "Well, I will just go without a job."  Because I was not going to do anything that I thought would--
Speaker 1: Jeopardize his position?
Speaker 2: --jeopardize his position.  So I resigned formally from Norfolk State a month, at most, after I got there.  And I was just--and they had no home for the president.  So we were, we were renting a house in out Vir- out in Virginia Beach [Virginia] and paying rent.  It was terrible.
Story_ID: 645558
Speaker 1: Now I--from some of what I've read, and from previous discussion with your husband [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] earlier today, I realize that there was some resistance, or resentment, of a new administration at Norfolk State [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] when you arrived.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely, there was.
Speaker 1: Resentment of you would be part of that, I imagine?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was, and is, a very bright young man who graduated from Norfolk State.  And he is now head of the chemical something in, I believe it is Chicago [Illinois].  But--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  No.  Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Cleveland, Ohio, okay.  But in any case, he was the choice of the outgoing president who had been at Norfolk State for at least thirty-six years, and who was revered by the entire community, both the university community and the surrounding community.  So, we came here under very difficult circumstances, both Harrison and I.  And people thought nothing of insulting us in whatever way they felt comfortable doing that.  And so they insulted me in the position that I held, and I'm sure they insulted Harrison.  Because I remember many times that the alumni met after he had become president, and would point to their leader, speaking of Dr. Brooks [Lyman Beecher Brooks], who had preceded Harrison.  So it was very, very difficult for several years.  But within a week after I resigned--and of course it was in the editor's--not only on the editor's page, but in the editor's message of the Journal--not the Journal and Guide [Norfolk Journal and Guide; New Journal and Guide], but the Virginia Ledger Star it was then.  But it was--they editorialized the entire situation.  And so of course, Old Dominion [Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia] knew about it, as did everyone else.  And within, oh, two weeks, they asked me join their staff.  And that's how I got to Old Dominion; and they gave me a full professorship.
Story_ID: 645559
Speaker 1: Were you one of the first blacks hired at Old Dominion [Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The first black.
Speaker 1: The very first.
Speaker 2: The first black, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew there couldn't have been too many more--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --ahead of (unclear).
Speaker 2: They had one woman, Bazemore, who was on their adjunct faculty.  She would teach a course here and there.  Willa Bazemore [Willa Spruill Bazemore] was her name.  And at that time she was, I think the vice mayor of Chesapeake [Virginia].  But I was the first full time African American that Old Dominion hired.  And they were very kind to me, very kind to me.  I enjoyed every moment that I spent at Old Dominion, except for the last three years.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened the last three years?
Speaker 2: Well, they got a new president who now is doing an institutional study for Norfolk State [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], believe it or not.  But they got a new president, and he thought, as I'm sure many others did, that it was a conflict of interest for me to be working at Old Dominion while my husband [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] was president of Norfolk State.  And one person even took me to the president, I mean took me to the dean of the School of Graduate Studies, because I had by then become the director of graduate studies, as it were.  But he, someone took me to the dean of graduate studies and said that I was carrying information from Old Dominion to Norfolk State, which was absolutely untrue, absolutely untrue.  And the dean said that; because he had known me for years.
Story_ID: 645560
Speaker 1: Now, is Old Dominion [Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia] a state supported school as well (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's the white counterpart of Norfolk State [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia].
Speaker 1: I see.  So, there's a rivalry for state dollars and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  And so the first president that was there, and all of his administrators, were very kind to me, and I enjoyed being at Old Dominion immensely.  But then there were two presidents since him, and for the life of me I can't remember the one who immediately followed him.  But then that second president was followed by James Koch, K-O-C-H, and he was not at all kind to me.  And I will say this publicly, because he knows it, and I have said it to him.  His question to me was, "How much longer do you have?"  I said, "Well, I've been here for twenty-two years."  And I had planned to retire at the age of sixty-five, which would have been the end of the summer.  But because of his attitude, I retired at the end of the semester in June of--what?  Twelve years ago.
Speaker 1: That would be 1998.
Speaker 2: Okay, that sounds right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That sounds right.  Yes, nineteen nine- 19--no, no, I'm sorry.  I retired in 1995.
Story_ID: 645561
Speaker 1: Tell me, what were some of your accomplishments at Old Dominion [Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well, I began the Ph.D. in urban services program.  That's probably my greatest accomplishment.  Before that, Old Dominion did not have a doctoral program at all.  And it began under my leadership, and exists to this day.  And it has grown tremendously since I left.  But as the director of the (unclear) and urban services--we call it the Ph.D. in urban services--I was responsible for administering the program in every way; from deciding who--from interviewing every single person who applied to the program and deciding whether or not they would be admitted, to reporting to the State Council of Higher Education, which was the office that guided both universities, all state universities in Virginia.  They call it SCHEV for short, S-C-H-E-V, State Council of Higher Education.  It's--
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: It's the State Council for Higher Education in Virginia [sic. State Council of Higher Education for Virginia].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, so we're talking about the State Council for Higher Education in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, well, that, as I said, is the official office for administering all the educational programs for state institutions throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this is the first program with urban services, the Ph.D. program.  It was the first Ph.D. program in the history of Old Dominion?
Speaker 1: In the history of Old Dominion.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So that was probably my, one of my greatest accomplishments, at least on paper.  I think that my greatest accomplishment though, was to serve as the mentor of African American youngsters who went to Old Dominion.  There were very few of us on faculty, and so whether they were--of course, I was not teaching for a long while, as I was the associate vice president for student services.  So I was available to them for whatever their problems were; whether they were not making the right grades, whether they were being harassed by a teacher, or they thought they were being harassed by a teacher.  But I also did it for white students as well.  They came with similar problems.  The major, one of the major functions of that position was to decide who would be considered in state and out of state.  Because there is an immense difference in the, in the tuition of in state students and out of state students.  And I developed a criteria for determining who was in state and who was out of state, and applied that--saw that that criteria was applied to every student about whom there was a question.  So those were my two, were my three (gesture) major functions as, as associate vice president.
Story_ID: 645562
Speaker 1: Now, you also sit on the--you, I mean outside of your duties at Old Dominion [Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia], you sit on the board of directors, or did, of The Planning Council of Tidewater [The Planning Council, Norfolk, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.  That, that was, that was, that was a very--how shall I say it?  It was a community organization, the major purpose of which was to plan activities that would be held in Tidewater [Virginia].  For example, we would plan whether or not the circus could come here, or whether the AFRAM convention could be held here; those kinds of things that really are decided before they get to you.  You know, you're just sort of a rubber stamp.  I called it a rubber stamp institution.  What was more important to me was serving on the school board of Norfolk [Virginia] and serving as--which I did for twelve years altogether.
Speaker 1: Starting when?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Oh, dear.  Let's see, twelve from '95 [1995] is what? (Unclear).  Starting in '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was chairman only for four years, from '91 [1991] to '95 [1995], when I retired.  That was, that was a very interesting job at that time, because busing was a problem. It--and there were people who were for bussing, primarily blacks, and people who were not, primarily whites.  And--
Speaker 1: Is this in the, no, not, in the '90s [1990s]?  In the 1990s, or in the--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Let's see.  I've forgotten--let's see.  I served on the school board from--no, I'm sorry, I take that back.  It was not a problem in the '90s [1990s].  It was a problem in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A major problem in the '80s [1980s].  But we had resolved the problem long before I got off the school board.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was thinking that's--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the school board in Norfolk was at that time, and I'm not sure it is now, was an appointed position.  You did not, it was not an elected position.  And so I was appointed by the city council [Norfolk City Council] to serve on the school board, which I did, as I said, for twelve years, four of which I served as chairman.  I think I said that before.
Story_ID: 645563
Speaker 1: So, how was busing resolved back in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, we decided, I among them, decided that we were going to return to neighborhood schools.  I fought busing for two or three years.  As a matter of fact, when I went on the board, they did not know what my position was on busing.  As a matter of fact, I didn't know.  I hadn't thought that much about it.  And, but I think that the people who appointed me to the school board thought that I would be against busing, though I had not said that.  It was a major issue when I got on the board, or became a major issue after I got on the board.  And the question was--well, of course some years before, the city had moved--they had not moved, but they had bussing to go to black neighborhoods to pick up children to carry them across town to white schools.  That's what integration was all about.  Because obviously it's true in Virginia--it certainly was then--as it is in most cities--that whites live in different neighborhoods from blacks.  So you have a school in the black community for the black kids, Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Norfolk, Virginia], and you have a school in the community for white kids.  And bussing, of course, allowed them to be integrated.  That's why they called it busing for integration.  And so, I went on the school board protesting busing.  And the great majority of the members of the school board, I think there were seven, five of them were for continued--well, for integration.  And two, myself and a minister, were for continued bussing.  I held that position for at least three years, speaking out, arguing in sessions, school board sessions and so forth.  And then I decided--well, Oklahoma had the same problem at the same time.  And Oklahoma eventually returned to neighborhood schools.  I knew that was, it was inevitable that Norfolk [Virginia] was going to return to neighborhood schools.  I knew that.
Story_ID: 645564
Speaker 1: So, I decided that it would be better for me to use my energies for something that I believed we could get.  I visited every school, every integrated high school in the city, I mean the area of Tidewater [Virginia]; every one in Norfolk [Virginia], I should say, and I saw what was going on.  The children were integrated officially, but the black kids were sitting together, eating together, and the white kids were doing the same.  So they were integrating--I mean they were segregating themselves.  I said, "Well, you know, integration really isn't working; it isn't working.  The only thing is that these kids are going to the same school, but they are still integrated, I mean segregated."  So, I decided to change my position on the question of busing.  I decided to go against busing, and go back for integration.  But I needed to know that the so called black schools were going to be funded higher than the white schools; that their funding from the state or from the city was going to be higher, because they needed more.  And so, those were the conditions under which I changed my position.
Speaker 2: So how did it--did you get what you wanted?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I did, I did.  I kept up with it.  I stayed on the board long enough to know that there were more books in the library; that the better trained teachers were spread around instead of going, sending them to the white schools; that teachers were placed on the basis of their abilities, their training.  Not their color, but their ability and their training and their specialties.  And that's, that was the price I charged for changing my position, and that was the price they paid.  And so of course, you know, the papers came out with, you know, I was Judas, and I was this and I was that.
Story_ID: 645565
Speaker 1: How did the local black officials, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in particular I guess, how did they react to?
Speaker 2: They were angry, they were angry.  They had to be, you know, for the public.  They had to be angry that a black had joined the whites.  They had to be angry, even if they weren't.  I had, you know, I received calls saying, "Well, I'm not really angry with you, you know, but we have to do this."  But on the other hand, I received calls from people, from black people, when I was placed on the school board, saying, "What are you doing on the school board?"  Because they had chosen their person to be on the school board.  He was a black lawyer who unfortunately has since passed.  But they had him picked out as the person they were going to support for the school board.  And when I was chosen, oh, I got some of the nastiest calls you can imagine from black educated lawyers who were members of the NAACP.  "How could you?  Why would you?  And your husband [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] is president of Norfolk State [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia]," and da da da da da.  So I said, "It's what I believe is the best thing to do.  And here are my reasons, and I want you to help me with this.  I have visited every school in the City of Norfolk [Virginia], every state supported school in the City of Norfolk.  And I know that those schools that are in the black communities have far less than those schools in the white, so called white communities.  Now, what I want us to do is to see that the black schools have the same materials, the same library books, the same teachers, as the white schools.  That's what I want."  I don't care if my kid sits next to a black kid.  All my children, you know, went to--and of course, they criticized me because our children went to schools in New England, high schools in New England.
Speaker 1: Prep schools, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, they criticized that.  "Well, she doesn't have to worry about it, because her children are all in New England, in New England prep school," and da da da da da.  I didn't care about any of that.  I did not care about any of that, because our children had, before they went to prep school, gone to public schools.  They didn't go to prep school in first grade; they went to prep school when they were in the ninth grade.

Speaker 1: So the, what's the upshot of all of it?  Has it worked out?  Has the, has the, you know, have the schools re- received the proper amount of funding and--
Speaker 2: I think they have.
Speaker 1: --distribution [in Norfolk, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: They certainly were when I, when left the school board.  I don't know what has happened since then, because I don't keep up with it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it's the kind of--
Speaker 2: And I'm in another city anyway.
Speaker 1: It's the kind of solution that probably requires a lot of oversight.  And--
Speaker 2: I'm sure it did.
Speaker 1: Well, there's no easy solution to any of this.  So, you know--
Speaker 2: That's right.  But I knew when I left that those salaries had been raised.  The funding had been raised for the libraries.  There were more books.  There were more materials.  There were more--whatever you use for science projects and so forth--aquariums and so forth.  They had those.
Speaker 1: Well, that has been a problem with every school district in the country, in the disparity of resources being spent.  And--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --that's, that was the cry in the first place, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely, absolutely.

Speaker 1: Tell me this, of all the civic things that you do--I read that you were chairman of March of Dimes [March of Dimes Foundation] once.  And you've probably done a million things in town.  Do you have a favorite, favorite project?
Speaker 2: I think my favorite project was one that was sponsored by The Links, Incorporated.  We had a project called Links to Success.  And at the time--I've forgotten the name of the president.  But at the time there were twelve cities--twelve--yeah, cities, that were awarded a Links to Success program.
Speaker 1: What time is this?  About what time period?
Speaker 2: This was, let's see.  This was about '88 [1988], I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the president, and I'm so sorry I cannot remember her name.  Barbara Simpkins [Barbara Dixon Simpkins], Barbara Simpkins was the president at that time.  And she came here for a program, and just fell in love with my husband.
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  Don't believe it.
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  Well, she acted that way.  I don't mean in love romantically, I don't mean that.  But she loved Harrison [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson].  She just thought he was such a great guy.  And she put him on the national board of The Links.  And I said, "Well, Harrison, when you all meet," I said, "I want one of those Link to Success programs."  And so, he got it for me.  He, he got the program for me as a member of Barbara Simpkins' board of directors.
Story_ID: 645568
Speaker 1: Now that's my favorite program, and I'll tell you why.  It lets you select a school that you know as a citizen of Norfolk [Virginia].  We were in Virginia Beach [Virginia] at the time--but as a citizen of this area--that these children are in need of more education than any other children in the Norfolk area.  These are the indigent children.  And when I mean, when I say indigent, I mean with a capital I.  Most of them do not have fathers.  Some of them are living with their grandparents and don't know where their mother is.  But all of them are children who are capable of learning.  And so, I chose Seatack Elementary School [Virginia Beach, Virginia] as the school in which I would develop the Links to Success program.  And there were twelve students, only twelve students who were chosen for the program.  And each week, I would meet with those students and their parents.  Well, at first it was just the students.  But the students were not coming, because it was meaning stay after school.  So, and children don't want to do that.  So I, the first thing I did was to begin feeding them, having dinner after school.  And I had a--of course it was a funded program.  But I had, I had cooks to prepare the most delectable meals that you can imagine.  Then I had the parents to come.  Every Thursday the parents would come, and we would all have they and their children, and the members and I at first.  Some of the other members eventually came.  But we would all have dinner at the school on Thursdays, catered by an outside--not cafeteria food--but catered by an outside person, a caterer.  And that program is still going on to this day.  It is still going on to this day.  As a matter of fact, they now have not only the Thursday program, but they have a Christmas program, and they have programs for other special occasions.  Harrison [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] spoke at one of our graduations.  And we had a special graduation.  I would have a special graduation for them where I would rent their robes and, you know, cap and gowns and so forth.  So that was my most enjoyable program, and it is still going on to this day.
Speaker 2: It sounds like a wonderful program.
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: The aspect of eating together and getting the parents involved; bringing them together around the food and--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --fellowship.  That's really incredible.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.  That was better than all of the others put together, it really was.  And I just hated to leave.
Story_ID: 645569
Speaker 1: I know you've already expressed some, with education and such, but what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I hope that African Americans will concentrate on being the best that they can be.  Now being the best that you can be, involves a lot of things.  It also involves being able to relate to other people, whether they are white, black, whatever.  I think that we as African Americans have been hurt for so long that the pain of segregation, the pain of slavery, is still within our hearts.  I know it is within mine.  And I believe that there're few African Americans who don't feel it.  I hope that we can get over that.  And I hope that we will help the white people to get over that.  And believe me, it's a lot of getting over for both of us, for both sides.  And I tell you why.  When Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] became president, and obviously black people alone did not put him in office.  There're not enough of us to put him in office.  White people voted for him, many white people.  But you would not believe it just walking down the street of this neighborhood.  I was the only person on this street that had an Obama sign, and that sign was taken up as often as I would put it out.  Everybody else had a sign for McCain [John McCain].
Speaker 1: Oh, McCain, yeah.
Speaker 2: McCain.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And so, I know from that that we are not at all together.  We are not at all together.  Of course some of my neighbors, you know, don't speak like they used to because I had my big sign out there.  And our older daughter [Jennifer Wilson] is a graphic designer.  So when they picked up my sign from outside, she just drew--fixed me a sign so I could put it on the window, on the house, so nobody could touch it.  And it stayed out there for months after Obama was made president (laughter).  And so, I don't even walk this way anymore.  I used to walk from here to the end of the street.  I don't walk that way anymore, because I'm afraid that somebody's going to run into me, as they have tried to do.
Speaker 1: That is a serious resentment.
Speaker 2: That's a very, very, serious resentment.  I walk in the opposite direction.  Most of our neighbors in this area down here are black.
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't ask you this before.  But I guess around 1968 or early '70s [1970s], the Association of Black Psychologists was formed.  Have you been associated with the Association of Black Psychologists at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, I haven't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  I've been associated with the association of psychologists [American Psychological Association].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not black psychologists.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Let's see.  The fact that I'm thinking about it means that it's hard for me to think of something that I would have done differently.  And I really cannot think of anything, because I think that I have learned so much from all of the experiences, negative though they may be.  I've had a lot of negative experiences, as you have, you know, as I have talked about.  You know, the trestle with the ice on it.  The writing, you know, that I was a Judas.  I've had some difficult times in my life; my father [Junius Reed] leaving us.  But I think that I would be a different person than I am now had I not experienced those things.  I don't even hate that I married before I married Harrison [HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson], although, I, it was a terrible, it was a terrible marriage.  And what I got out of it was, some of it was terrible, but I think I learned from that.  (Laughter) I learned what not to do, for one thing.  So, I really can't think of anything that I would do differently.  And that may sound, you know, arrogant.  But I just can't think of anything.  I'm sure there are, but I just can't think of them.
Story_ID: 645571
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I don't know what my legacy will be.  But I would like my legacy to be that she was a good person; that she was a loving person; that she knew how to treat people from the highest to the lowest.  That's what I would like my legacy to be.
Story_ID: 645572
Speaker 1: Now, I know you talked about the family somewhat.  But I've only got three more questions.  And one of them is just kind of give us a kind of recap of where the family is right now.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know.
Speaker 2: Of course both my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson], my biological father [Junius Reed], and my stepfather [Isaac Nicholson] are all dead.  My brother [James O'Neal], who was my mother's first child and looked white, is also dead, but I maintain a relationship with his children.  They came to our daughter's wedding and to our son's funeral; we lost one son [Richard Wilson].  I'm sorry, I forgot the question now.
Speaker 1: Oh, I was just asking you about the family, where it stands today.
Speaker 2: Okay, where the family stands.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Harrison [Wilson's second husband, HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson] mentioned the sons have careers and they're--
Speaker 2: Yes, they do, they do.  Our oldest son is a lawyer [Benjamin F. Wilson].  Our second oldest son is also a lawyer [Harrison Wilson III], but he is very ill, very, very ill.  Our third son [John Wilson] is out of a job at the moment, to be honest.  But he is very well qualified.  All of our children went to Ivy League schools.  All the boys went to Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire], and one of the girls went to Mount Holyoke [Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Massachusetts] for her master's [degree].  And--
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  That's the school I couldn't think of, Mount Holyoke.
Speaker 2: Mount Holyoke.  And our youngest daughter went to UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia].  So, all of them are very well educated, and I'm happy about that.  And they of course have had instilled in them, instilled in them the importance of education.  And so they are following our lead in educating their own children, and I'm very happy about that.  Okay, what's the status of our family?  I have a sister, a half-sister, although I don't regard her as such, who is living.  I have a brother who is living.  My full brother, named for my father, still lives in Atlanta [Georgia].  And his son is the mayor of Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Kasim Reed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Kasim Reed is the mayor of Atlanta.  That's my nephew.  He is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  (Simultaneous) (Unclear) a tremendous man, young man, forty years old.  Okay.  I get excited sometimes about things.
Story_ID: 645573
Speaker 1: Well, that's my nephew [Kasim Reed], my full grown, I mean my full blooded nephew.  Let's see.  I don't have any contact with anyone else in my family, because I don't think there is anybody to be contacted.  I think they're all dead.  I think that all my parents' siblings are dead.  And so, that brings me to our colored family, because I had no other family.  I had two families.  My father [Junius Reed] and then my stepfather [Isaac Nicholson] was very good to me, and by whom my mother [Christine O'Neal Nicholson] had her last two children.  So, they are my stepbrother [Ernest Nicholson] and sister [Ivie Nicholson Fulton], but I don't think of them as such.  Just as I don't think of my own children as my stepchildren.  It was never my stepchild.  This is my, these are my kids.  They are doing well, some better than others.  Benji [Benjamin F. Wilson], as I said, is a very good lawyer, and he is sort of the chief of his firm.  He works for Beveridge and Diamond [Beveridge and Diamond, P.C.] in Washington [D.C.], and he is the chief honcho.  His wife [Merinda Wilson] is also a lawyer, retired from, oh, I've forgotten the law firm, but it's a very, a very popular law firm.  Our second son [Harrison Wilson III] is very ill, as I said before.  His wife [Tammy Wilson] is not one of my favorite people, and she has kept him away from us.  We really have to literally look for him when we go to Richmond [Virginia].  We have to look for him to see what hospital he's in.  Our third son, John [John Wilson], is currently without a job, although he's highly qualified.  His wife [Tressa Wilson] has an excellent job with IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  He was with IBM before he was let go.  Our older daughter [Jennifer Wilson] is with CBS.  She is a graphics designer, a senior designer they call her, a senior designer for CBS.  So the billboards that you see that were put out by CBS, or Viacom [Viacom Inc.], which CBS bought, that's a part of her work.  And April [April Wilson Woodard], our youngest daughter, is now working for BET [Black Entertainment Television], although--and she comes on nationwide on Monday nights at 6:40 and 6:20 and 7:40 Sometimes she comes on on Tuesday as well.  But she worked for 'Inside Edition' for ten or twelve years, and so you saw her every night.  This job is not as, does not pay as much as the first job that she had, but she was let go when things were, when people were letting go folks all over the place.  So she and John were both let go, but John has not found anything.  April has.
Speaker 2: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  She was making $200,000.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  They hired three people for her money, three qualified people for her pay.
Speaker 1: Right.  And of course BET is not paying two hundred thousand any more.  And so, her salary has been reduced considerably.  But her husband [Adrian Woodard] is working, and they have two children.  They seem to be doing well.  I'm going up to take care of the children while they go to Los Angeles [California] on Thursday, and I'll come back on Sunday.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So they're all, they're doing well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They're doing well.
Story_ID: 645574
Speaker 1: Is there anything that I have not asked you that you think we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: (HISTORYMAKER HARRISON B. WILSON):  What's the question?  I'd like to hear.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that he has not asked that I would like to talk about?  I would just like to talk about my current marriage, my present marriage to Harrison [HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson].  We've been married for, it will be forty-three years in August, and he has brought a lot of joy to my life.  Being the parents of six children has brought a lot of joy to my life.  We lost a son [Richard Wilson] four years ago, and that was probably one of the saddest times of my life.  And it will also be sad if we lose our son who is so very ill.  But Harrison and I have similar goals.  We want the best for our children.  We want to have a nice home.  We want to remember our parents, which he does more than I do, honestly.  Because until recently he used to go Amsterdam, New York every, every Memorial Day to place flower- flowers on his parents' graves.  I never did that, although I love my parents.  But, but life with Harrison has been a major change for me, considering the life that I had before him.  And to be honest with you, before Harrison came along, I had vowed to the Lord and all other responsible people that I would never get married again.  I had vowed that I would raise my daughter [Jennifer Wilson], and I knew that I could take care of both of us.  And I vowed that I would never get married again.  He changed that, and I'm glad he did.
Story_ID: 645575
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know how I can answer that differently.  But I would like to be remembered as a good person, as a person who looked out for the underdog, who never flaunted whatever she had accomplished, who couldn't care less about a doctorate degree.  I used to say to people, "The only person I want to know about that is the finance man.  I want him to know."  But I, I'm not concerned about being called doctor, nor being thought about as doctor.  Because that has gotten me into trouble too.  "Oh, she thinks she's this and that."  I hope people will not say that about me when I'm gone.  I hope my legacy is that of one who cared, who took time to love, to care for, and to put hands on.  Not one who just talked, but was willing to do.
