 Finchum  Today is September 18, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University. We   re doing a  project  called  Oklahoma 100 Year Life, with people who have lived to  be 100 or older. Today we   re in Skiatook, Oklahoma to speak with  George Creider. Thank you very much for having us. Let   s start with  having you tell us when and where you were born.  I was born August 17, 1912 in Red Cloud, Nebraska.  What did your parents do for a living?  Well, Dad, I guess you would say, was a tailor. He made suits and also  ran a dry cleaning shop.  And did you grow up on a farm or live in town?  In town.  Did your mother work?  She did Dad   s books for the shop, yes.  How had he learned to be a tailor? Where did he learn to be a tailor?  Where did he learn? That, I don   t know. I know he was a tailor in Red  Cloud and ran a cleaning shop. After he and Mother were married, I  don   t know how many years, but he was an instructor in a suit making  shop. You know, where they made men   s suits.  Okay.  5  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  And then, I guess, he traveled around quite a bit. Well, during World  War I, he was a rural mail carrier. That had to be about 1915, along in  there. After I was a little tot, my grandparents lived midway on his route  so he   d take me up there at times. I   d stay overnight and he   d take me  back home the next day.  And take you how? By horse?  By horse, yes. Horse and buggy. He had, I think, three horses. If it was  real bad, muddy weather, he   d use a team on his mail cart. You know,  those carts they used to have. In good days, it was a single horse. It was  a faster horse, and bigger. He made his routes every day. I believe his  was twenty-six miles.  How long did he do that?  I think until the end of the war.  Did you ever go with him?  No, only to     Just to your grandmother   s?  Yes, I   d go with him. Go to my grandparents and then back home.  How did he come to have that job?  That, I don   t know.  Where did you go to school?  Well, I went to first grade in Aspen, and then we moved to Colorado  Springs. I guess I went to school there until 1923, I believe it was   we  moved to Chandler, Oklahoma. So I went to school   I guess I was about  twelve years old when we moved to Chandler. I graduated from  Chandler High School.  What year?   Nineteen  thirty-two.  What brought you to Chandler?  That, I don   t know. (Laughs) Daddy had a job, I believe. How he got it, I  have no idea. He worked for a large clothing store as   he done repair,  6  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  alterations and such as that on suits for them. Then he had a   I don   t  know the word. He had a job offer in Chandler, Arizona and one in  Chandler, Oklahoma. The Arizona one was supposed to let him know by  a certain date, and they didn   t. So that   s the way we ended in Oklahoma.  Have you been here  in Oklahoma  ever since?   Yes.  We moved to Broken Arrow in    33. Then we moved to Tulsa in     36. Then we moved up here  Skiatook  in    68.  So in    36, that was around the Depression. Do you have anything to tell  us about that?  Well, in    33, we moved to Broken Arrow and he ran an old Kentucky  Colonel Hotel there  on South Main Street . In    35, we farmed for a  fellow that was sick. Then we moved to Tulsa in    36 and here in    68.  Let   s back up and say who    we    are. How many brothers and sisters did  you have?  I have one sister and two brothers.  And where do you fall?  I   m the oldest. My sister is next.  After high school, what did you do?  Well, I worked for Dad until I moved to Tulsa. Whatever he was in, I  helped and worked with him. So you can   t say I didn   t. (Laughs)  Were you in World War II?  No. I was working for a steel company at the time and we were doing a  lot of government work. So I was, I guess you could say, excused.  (Laughter) I was what they called a checker. The people would lay out  steel and such and I checked it before it was processed.  Kind of like quality control?  Yes.  How long did you do that?  Maybe a few years. At the end of the War, he was a truck driver for the  shop, he was hired as assistant superintendent of the shop   schedules,  7  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Bishop  Creider  you know. My foreman thought he should have got it and he quit so I  got be a foreman. I don   t remember how long. I was that until I quit in     68, retired.  You retired in    68? Yeah. Your father was a jack-of-all-trades, then.  He was. How he could learn   he could step into anything. He ended up  as a furrier. He bought and made and remodeled fur coats for ladies. He  was a man that could just step into anything and make a go of it.  And were you kind of like that, too?  I can   t say so. (Laughter) I just, like I say, worked for the shop. I did my  jobs the best I could do. I went to work there as a laborer the last day of  August. And it was hot. (Laughter) I put my billfold up here (gestures to  shirt pocket) and it would be sweated through.  Very hot. Well, tell us about how you met your wife.  Well, a friend of mine one day   well, he wasn   t a friend of mine. I knew  him. I was leaving the service station and he said,    I   m going to go pick  Mazie up.    I didn   t know her. He said,    Why don   t you just park  downtown and we   ll come by and change cars because you   ve got a  better one.    And before we parted, I had a date with her.  Moved kind of fast, there.  And from there it went.  What would you do on a date?  Oh, just ride around mostly. Well, one of our biggest deals,    I wonder  where this road goes.    And we   d follow it out.  What did you ride around in?  Ford. Most cars I   ve had have been Fords. I did have one or two Chevys.  I don   t remember. One of the first cars I had was a 1928 Dodge Fast  Four, they called them. I gave a whole fifty dollars for it. (Laughter) I  drove it, my brother drove it and he sold it to the other brother. We  ended up having it a long time. Just an old beat up Dodge touring car.  No, it wasn   t a touring car. It was enclosed.  In the shop, when I was about fourteen, I started delivering clothes. You  couldn   t do it today, but I delivered clothes up to midnight. We had one  customer that would get us on the phone and tell me to go get a pair of  8  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  pants out of the closet. I   d just go into the house and get it. We were  trusted, then.  You couldn   t do that, today.  Couldn   t do that today. I   ve got an old cowboy hat in there that I gave a  whole two dollars for when I was in school. Do you think you could  leave that hat hanging in the hallway now-a-days? Could then and  nobody bothered it.  How would you get to school?  We walked. We lived in town.  And high school, too?  Yes.  And that was in Chandler.  That was in Chandler.  What was Chandler like back in those days? Did it have a movie  theater?  Oh, yes. H S. (Laughs) Yeah, they ran nights and Saturdays and  Sundays.  And that   s where you would take your date?  Well, yeah.  Did you go to dances?  I never learned to dance. I never did learn. I guess that is odd     No. Well, was religion important?  You might say yes. There was a Methodist church there in Chandler.  Went on Sundays?  Oh, yes. That was a must. At least one service on Sunday. Of course,  you had your little meetings with the youth group. I   m trying to think of  the name   Epworth League, I think was its name.  9  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  What would you do for fun?  Mostly just ride around. Back then, you couldn   t do it today, strip down  and take a Ford car and all you had was the steering wheel and you sit  on the gas tank. Didn   t have a body. (Laughter) It was a wonder we  hadn   t gotten killed with what we done with those things. (Laughter)  On dirt roads?  Yes. Oh, yes, and five miles an hour in town. If you were doing fifteen  on the highway or twenty   say twenty-five, you were speeding.  (Laughter) There were three pedals down on the floor. No gear shift.  You had your cruise control, which was two little levers under your  steering wheel. This was gas and this was the spark. Pull it down, was as  fast as it would go. You had your turn signals, which were going to turn  left   that   s left (gestures arm bent up). That was stop (gestures arm bent  down). This was right (gestures arm straight out).  You had a heater, that is, if you bought a deal that sat over the manifold  and came down and drilled a hole in the floorboard. If you didn   t want  the heat, you had to put something over the hole. (Laughs) You had a  thermometer   that is, if you bought a gadget that went on the hood, the  radiator. Something else    Oh, and the windshield wiper was this  (gestures your shirt sleeve). (Laughter) Oh, yeah, if you had a long hill  to go, you better turn around at the bottom and back up because you had  to keep that gas tank higher than your carburetor.  Go in reverse, huh.  And that was the middle pedal down here on the floor. You had three  pedals on the floor. You let your brake off and put this one in neutral  (gestures). That   s low (gestures). That was high (gestures). If you   re  going in reverse, put this one in neutral and this is here (gestures), your  reverse pedal. And this was your brake (gestures).  No clutch.  No clutch. No shift. It was all done right there. You had a brake on the  rear wheels, but it was controlled with this lever. You never    just like a  parking brake, you might say. They were fun to drive.  Did you ever wreck one?  No, not in there. I have had a wreck. When was it? I don   t know. Oh,  yeah, we were driving down the road and we were just about even with  each other. This fellow decided to turn, but no one was hurt. No damage  10  Finchum  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  caused   they were both junk cars. (Laughter)  Back in those days, Chandler was on Route 66?  Yes. Route 66 came through there. And 18,  Highway  18 North and  South. I don   t know. That   s been a long time ago.  Can you tell us a little bit about your work? You said you worked at a  steel company.  Yes.  And what type of   ?  We built oil drilling rigs. We built platforms. I think my nearest call  was, one time we had a frame that was about twenty-foot high. We were  assembling it and we had what we called spreaders. We had the chain  wrapped around it. As he raised it, it rolled in the chain. We were up  there and this spreader wouldn   t go into the structure because it was like  that. It wasn   t like this (gestures). I took a hold of that chain as he went  up and out that way. One of the fellows said I swung with that chain  three times. I finally ended with my arm over one side of it and I was  standing on the metal beam. I was so happy that the fellow up there with  me didn   t grab for me because he would have fallen off. He asked me to  get down and I said,    I can   t.    (Laughter) I was hung, pinched. He said,     Well, how do you want to do it?    I said,    Let the crane driver ease off,     and it did. It just rolled off. My arm didn   t hurt none at all and got me  down on the ground.  Sounds like a pretty risky job.  It was. I   ve seen some, well, guys get their knees taken off, fingers     well, there   s a little one (gestures to hand).  You lost a finger, huh? Is that a work related injury?  I was holding a pin, a piece of shaft. It was about that long and about  that big around. I was holding it for the guy to drive it in. He hit it and it  bounced off and I hit the edge of the beam   cut it off. Then my back,  I   ve had for years   I think I got it back there when I was a laborer.  What company did you work for?  It was Lee C. Moore.  And where were they located?  11  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Finchum  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bradley  Finchum  They were located on Peoria and Lattimer Street, I believe it was.  In Tulsa?  In Tulsa. After the boy   s father passed away, he moved out to the water,  the  port  there by Catoosa. He moved out there. Whether it was still  going, it evidently is because I   m still getting a little bonus check.  (Laughter) Still getting paid.  I   m still getting paid.  And how many years, again, did you work for them?  Forty.  Forty years.  That   s a long time for one place.  And then, they had a plant back in Pittsburg. After I retired, I made three  trips back there to   I guess you could say instruct people on how to do  things. How to straighten beams and channels. The mill had a tolerance,  but it might be a little bowed and they   ve got to have it straight and I   d  show them how to straighten that stuff.  You probably taught them quite a bit.  Yeah.  How many children do you have?  One. Right in there.  And is she a little spoiled?  I think she was. (Laughter) I   m sure happy she decided to look after me.  What is one of the fondest memories you have as a parent?  I can   t say. (Laughs)  The day he walked me down the aisle and got rid of me. (Laughter)  She says the day she got married.  12  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Bradley  Creider  Well, that was one.  Got rid of her. (Laughter)  Got her out of the house. I don   t know. I can   t say. (Laughter)  Well, would you take vacations?  Yes. I got a whole two weeks a year.  What was a typical vacation like for you?  Oh, we   d just have somewhere to drive, someplace to go see something.  A park or something like that, you know. I guess that is about it. May go  visit some of our relations, probably.  Did you have a special place you particularly enjoyed?  Maryville.  Where would you like to go?  I   d liked to have made a trip to California sometime, but we never did.  Something came up that kept us from going.  Do you remember seeing your first airplane?  No. I don   t remember. That would be way back during the two-wing  ones.  A biplane? (Laughter) What about your first television?  Our first television   what was it Beverly? Just a little thing.  It was smaller than that (gestures).  We all got right in front of it. (Laughter) It came on about six o   clock, I  think, wasn   t it? Something like that, with that snow. Finally have our  program. I don   t know if we had trouble with it or not. I don   t remember  if it would go off every once in a while. I don   t remember.  But there has been, you know, cell phones   that   s something we never  thought of. I can remember Grandma   s, two shorts and one long.  (Laughter) Everybody in the country is on the party line and listened in.  13  Finchum  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Finchum  Creider  No secrets.  No secrets. Horses   we had a little Shetland pony when I was, I guess,  thirteen, fourteen, fifteen   along in there. And a buggy. We had a burro.  That was the most gentle thing you ever saw. You could pile kids on her  from her neck to her backside, tailbone. She was alright. I could walk  under her or crawl under her. Anything   it didn   t make a difference.  She never hurt anybody.  What was her name?  That I don   t remember. We lived on a little acreage for a while outside  of Chandler. I could ride a horse into town, turn it loose and it would go  home, and I   d have to ride home with Dad. (Laughter)  Sounds like you maybe walked a few times, too. (Laughter)  She was a good one. This Shetland pony, though, some kids had her that  were more or less cowboys. You could ride her as long as you didn   t  touch her flank. Boy, if you touched her flank, you were on the ground.  Otherwise, you never touched her flank, you were alright. I guess they  were trying to make her buck, you know. She could do it. (Laughter)  What is a typical day for you at 100? At your age now, what is a typical  day for you?  Right now?  Yeah.  Eat and sleep. (Laughs)  What time do you get up?  I get up about five thirty and I go out and feed the cats. Then I come in  and get my thyroid pill, take it and I get the book (Bible) out and read it.  Used to be, we had a different mail carrier, you could go out at six  o   clock and get the paper, but now I wait until seven. I   ve made as high  as four trips out there after that paper. Now, I just wait until seven  o   clock before I get the paper.  Then what?  Then I come in here and Roy  son-in-law  makes some coffee and we  look at the paper. He reads it. I   m getting now to where all I read is the  headlines. After everybody gets out, I try to get this old thing  14  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Bradley  Creider   magnifying glass  out. (Laughs) It   s getting to where I can   t read small  print anymore.  What types of books do you read?  I   ve got about one hundred Louis L   Amour books in there. I   ve read  them twice. My brother has read them, my friend has read them and I   m  on my third time. (Laughter)  Third time   s a charm. So you like westerns.  Yeah, these are all old westerns, Louis L   Amour.  I   ll be darn. This one is Fallen. Fallen is the name of this. So you   re a  Louis L   Amour fan.  Yes.  And you used to collect trains?  My brother-in-law, he was making HO model trains. He got me  interested. I had a pretty good sized layout out there. I was just   both of  us just lost interest in it for some reason. I have no idea. I just quit, and I  don   t know what started me getting these scroll saws, but I started that.  I   ve made a lot of them. I just give them away. I guess I   ve sold a few.  Twenty or thirty.  How did you learn how to do that?  They have a pattern and you draw it out on a one-eighth plywood and  saw. I   ve lost interest in that. Of course, when I got to where I couldn   t  follow the line, I quit. There wasn   t any use in wasting plywood.  When you decided to retire, did you have plans?  No. Just work on this place. This was a vacant lot. My brother and I put  up a fence. I built that barn by   well, I started to say by myself, but one  evening, here come all the neighbor guys over. I built the rafters and had  them down there. It was a pole barn is what it was intended to be. I had  the holes open and they put that up. That   s all the help I had. I built the  rest of it. They just set them up there for me, and I built the rest of it.  There   s a metal one, now.  The big one.  The ones in there, they brought in one for the rabbits and Roy   s key  15  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Bradley  Bishop  Creider  Bishop  shop. And I planted trees. A friend across the street   s brother worked  down in    I wanted to say Wright City   in that area, that big lumber  company and their lumber mill down there. They have these little shoots,  plants that he   d bring up and I planted them. Boy, they   re hard to plant. I  have an old axel   not an axel   drive shaft? Punch a hole, put it in, drop  it and that   s it. It   s planted. (Laughter)  But does it grow?  It   s those trees down there.  What is your secret to longevity?  I don   t think there is a secret. I think mostly it   s just have something to  do. Keep busy with something.  Do you have a motto you live by or a philosophy of life?  I don   t know. I   ve never even thought of it.  Did you ever think you   d live to be a hundred?  Heavens no. Heavens no. I didn   t even intend to. (Laughter)  Well, when you turned ninety-nine, you said,    One more year?     Well, I guess so. They had my birthday on my ninetieth and I don   t  know what I said. She said,    We   ll have your birthday ten years from  now, too.    I said,    No, they won   t.    (Laughter) She made a liar out of  me. Another ten. (Laughs)  Just not being able to do anything. Of course, like I say, I go get the  paper in the morning. She won   t let me go get the mail. If I catch her  gone, I sneak out there for a minute.  And you take the trash out. That   s one of your chores.  You still have chores, today?  Yeah. I take out their trash bags and they drink a lot of pop so I have  cans to smash. And the paper, I take it out, bag it or take it to recycling.  On a morning like today, I didn   t have any trash. There was only two or  three cans. That   s not worth taking out.  (Laughter) It was an easy day today.  16  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Bishop  Creider  Bradley  Bishop  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Easy day. Yes it was.  How late do you stay up?  I usually go in around a quarter to ten or something like that and go to  bed.  And get up at five thirty.  Yes. This morning, I got up   I have no clock so I was ten minutes early  this morning. (Laughter) Then I went back to bed. I just slept on  through. That   s another thing that aggravates me. After I get the paper     I call it passing out   just go to sleep. And Roy lets me. I tell him,     Wake me up.    He lets me sleep, maybe thirty or forty minutes. A lot of  times, it is maybe thirty minutes, mostly.  A little catnap.  Yeah. I go out in the daytime. I usually go out because they   re trying to  freeze me in here. (Laughter)  When history is written, what do you want it to say about you? What do  you want to be remembered for?  I have no idea. What would people want to   Beverly?  Don   t ask me. You tell me.  What would you hope people like your family   what do you want to be  remembered for?  I have no idea, whatever they want.  A good provider.  Well, I was. We never had any handout or anything like that. We   ve  always been able to purchase what we needed. You might say I   ve been  a good provider   that   s about as good as you can get.  If someone asked you for advice on how to live to be 100, what would  you tell them?  Well, one thing   leave cigarettes alone and the bottle alone and behave  yourself. (Laughter) I smoked for a couple of years. One year, shoot, I  was smoking three to four packs a day. One day, one of the other  foremen came by and took my cigarettes out of my pocket. He said,    I   ll  17  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Bradley  Finchum  Creider  quit if you will.    I said,    Put them back, and I   ll quit with you.    So I  carried them for a couple, three weeks   I might have got one to my  mouth   I don   t remember and it went back in the pack. As far as  whiskey, daiquiris and such as that, is the only way I got hung over or  drunk a drop of straight whiskey. As far as chasing around, after my  wife passed away  in 1983  I never saw anyone I   d want to marry. I  guess I turned out to be a hermit. (Laughter)  So that just leaves, what would you eat? Did you have a special diet?  No, I guess not. Now they fix my meals. Every once in a while I   ll get a  sandwich at noon and on it, I   ll just have Miracle Whip, and a slice of  cheese and a slice of bologna and then a bag of chips doused with a little  honey.  Honey?  Yep. I   ve almost got that one done. (Laughter) She got me that one  (gestures to plastic bottle of honey) so I can try to squeeze it.  Well, when you were growing up, what was your favorite meal your  mother fixed?  Lord, I don   t know.  Fried Chicken?  That was one of the good ones. That   s a good one   fried chicken. Did  you or Debbie make the pancakes the other day? They were just about  that big (gestures small circle). Mom made them the size of a plate. Eggs  now-a-days are not like the old days. Chickens ran free out there and  picked up the bugs and seeds and such as that. The lady next door, she  was going with a guy and she said he wouldn   t eat these eggs, because  she bought country eggs. That yolk had a color to it instead of a pale  yellow. He thought something was wrong with them. They were good     had flavor. (Laughter) Eggs now, they   re good, yes, but not like the old  ones.  You definitely don   t get a double yolked one anymore.  Double yolks are hard to come by.  Yeah, we used to get a lot of double yolks. If you went to hatch them,  you better candle them. If you get a double yolk in there you have two  chicks in one    (Laughs)  18  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Bradley  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  If you had to do something over again, is there something?  If I knew what I knew now, just go to work for the shop, is one probably  or marry Mazie would be another. I think marry Mazie would be the  one. I don   t know. They treated me real good, I thought. Because the  owner of the place, one day, came up to me and tapped me on the  shoulder and said,    When are you going to grow up?    That was when I  hadn   t been there but for two or three years. (Laughs) I don   t know, I  guess I had just had a way with my guys, my crew. I gave them a job  and I wouldn   t tell them how to do it. I figured their way will be quicker  and cheaper than my way, telling them what to do. If they wanted to ask  questions, I   d give them my view, but they   d been there, too. They knew  what their job was. We always met our dates when we were supposed to  have it done. Like I say, I   m still getting a     Little bit of money. (Laughter)  And he still talks to some of the guys he worked with. They still call him  every once in a while.  You still have your workers calling you?  Well, there   s one who calls every once in a while. Of course, I can   t hear  on the phone. Roy talked to one here a while back. What did he tell  Roy? Best boss he ever worked for? I think that   s what he said. He was  one of my good men, too. Of course, he   s the only one who calls me.  There were others that I got Christmas cards from, three or four. Not  many of us left. (Laughs)  Well, besides going to California, what else would you want to do?  Oh, I have no idea.  You   ve done it all, huh?  I know I haven   t done it all, but I   ve done my share. Like I say, I never  ran around     Had a pretty good life?  Well, I think so. I   ve never, well, up until about two months ago I   d only  been in a hospital for my knee, my tonsils and it seemed to me like there  was something else.  And your finger?  19  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  Finchum  Creider  No, didn   t go to a hospital. Just went to the doctor   s office.  (Laughter) That   s a pretty good track record. Besides your thyroid  medicine, do you take any other?  I take a little baby aspirin.  Vitamins. Calcium     Yeah.  That   s pretty good, too.  Thyroid is the only prescription. These are all just straight off the shelf.  I hope I   m that lucky.  (Laughter) I really feel lucky on that because outside of my back, I have  no hurts.  Anything you want to add before we close out?  I guess not.  Well, we thank you very much for sharing.  Okay, you   re welcome.  -------  -------
