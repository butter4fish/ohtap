Speaker 2: Like her birth place, Lakeland, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Again, I'd have to get her date of birth from my--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Files.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let's start with Janie Belle Williams Murray and how far back can you trace her parents and grandparents and so forth?
Speaker 2: To her father, and her father's father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what was her father's name?
Speaker 2: Her father's name was Sam Williams.
Speaker 1: Sam Williams, okay.  And, do you, and if you don't, that's fine, but, do you happen to know, Sam Williams' place of birth and date of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in South Carolina.  That's, that's all I know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you don't know the date of birth?
Speaker 2: I have it on the records.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I should've gotten all that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Sam Williams' father, which would be your mother's fathers' father, do you know, happen to know his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Hemingway [Dr. W C. Hemingway], after whom the City of Hemingway, South Carolina was named.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: He was white--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --landholder.  And, he gave to his son Samuel an extensive piece of land to farm--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, that became the family heritage.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, let me get this.  Hemingway was Samuel's, let's see--
Speaker 2: Father.
Speaker 1: Father.  Okay, I got it.  We don't know Hemingway's first name, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Good enough.  And, do you know how many acres that was that Samuel received?
Speaker 2: No.  But, it was an extensive acreage.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.   And, have you--
Speaker 2: And, I apologize for these statistics.
Speaker 1: Not a problem.
Speaker 2: What I'll do is--the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, when I went up to spend a few days with them in Salt Lake City [Utah], they did a family trace on, as they do for all.  They couldn't go any further back than four generations.  But, they did get this information.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I'll get that to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That, that sounds wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That sounds wonderful.  Is there any other information you had on the father or on Samuel?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 309117
Speaker 1: Samuel [Samuel Williams], grandfather, used the family to do the work on the plantation where they grew cotton, tobacco, potatoes.  I encountered them when his daughter, Janie [Janie Williams Murray], my natural mother, died.  I was three years of age.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, my father [Edward Murray, Sr.] brought us from Lakeland, Florida, where I was born, to his in-laws, to my mother, deceased mother's family, in Hemingway, South Carolina.

Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And, let's, let's go back.  How much--well, first of all, let me ask you this, how much to you know about Janie Belle, her growing up there in Hemingway?  How--do you know any of that history of her growing up?
Speaker 1: No.
Story_ID: 309118
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father.  So I don't wanna lose, lose this.  How far back can--what--how much knowledge do you know about your father's father and grandfather?

Speaker 2: It's Lanes, L-A-N-E-S, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: L-A-N--
Speaker 2: A-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: A-N-E-S, South Carolina.  Okay.  All right.  And, the--do you have any information on your father, how your father and your mother [Janie Williams Murray] met?  When they met?

Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, any background information on your father growing up in Lanes, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: No.  I think it was pretty standard except his emphasis on education.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 2: In Hemingway, South Carolina.
Story_ID: 309119
Speaker 1: You said you did not know anything about how they [Murray's parents, Janie Williams Murray and Edward Murray, Sr.], they met.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Since, since there was a time when your mother did live in Lakeland, Florida.
Speaker 2: Yes.  After they married--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: They moved to Lakeland, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, that's where he was a principal--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There?  Your mother, your mother was a housewife?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, how about, how about your chi- siblings, Reverend Murray [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray]?
Speaker 2: I have a brother, Edward W. Murray, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's a retired lieutenant colonel, United States Air Force.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Living in San Antonio [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, it was just the three children?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, at some time Janie Belle Williams Murray--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Edward W. Murray.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, married to your father?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did she pass, or?
Speaker 2: She died when I was three years of age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that mean she died in 1933.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, I see--
Speaker 2: And, I think they were married in 1927.
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-seven [1927].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, let me just get this, because I wrote--left out a very important thing.  Your date of birth (laughter) and--
Speaker 2: September 26, 1929.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, that was in Hemingway [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Lakeland, Florida.
Speaker 1: Oh, you, oh, in Lakeland.
Speaker 2: Lakeland, Florida.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, after my mother died then we were taken to Hemingway.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Then sometime during that period, Minnie L. Saunders [Minnie Saunders Murray] married--came into your life?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, married your father?
Speaker 2: Precisely.
Speaker 1: That was down in Lakeland?
Speaker 2: Lakeland.
Speaker 1: And, okay.  I just wanted to get all of this straight.  And, okay.  Now, your father was the principal there in Lakeland, West Palm Beach [Florida], and Mulberry [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I was trying to read my own, own writing.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: And, you, you are born on--of--is Edwin--Edward, Jr. the oldest?
Speaker 2: He's the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, Louise is?
Speaker 2: Is the youngest.
Speaker 1: So, that you're right in the middle (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm the middle.  Yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 309120
Speaker 1: You were born in 1929--
Speaker 2: Twenty-nine [1929].
Speaker 1: And, how much do you remember in those early years prior to school?  What like was like there with your father [Edward Murray, Sr.] and your stepmother [Minnie Saunders Murray]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, your two siblings [Edward Murray, Jr. and Louise Murray Bowman], or?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was born during the Depression [Great Depression].  And, I remember in both the place of my birth, Lakeland, Florida, and some years later, four years later in West Palm Beach [Florida] where I spent the majority of my youth, there were camps set up by the government to feed people who did not have food.  I remember the lines of people in--waiting for those camps to open so that they could get a supply of groceries.  I remember no electricity in two of the areas, but oil lamps for lights.  And, you would buy ice about three cents to five cents a block and put it in a refrigerator because you did not have an electrical refrigerator let alone a freezer.  You had a pump in the backyard in both Lakeland, Florida, and in Hemingway, South Carolina.  We had plumbing in West Palm Beach, but otherwise there was a pump and a well.  I could remember it was a very simple time where the black family was a unit, biological unit; the father, the mother and they probably would average about three children.  Your significant people were not only your biological family, but your extended family.  The neighbors up and down the streets who would help in rearing you.  Teachers and preachers who were significant as those who help you formulate your life.  The Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America] movement was extremely important and the scoutmaster played a great part.  I remember there was certain micro-entrepreneurs, since the woman worked in the house, an apron mama, and the male perhaps outside of the home, a blue collar dad.  So, you had the grocery man, the fish man, the dry cleaning man, the car repair man, the filling station man, once in a while a doctor, a dentist, and the small business, which remains today as the heart of America--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was what was prevalent and predominate so that a work ethic was there not only in the parents but in the children.  I remember going to work after school in third grade for the Afro-American Life Insurance Company in West Palm Beach, Florida.  And, then the next job being at a white beauty salon, Valerie's Beauty Salon [ph.] on Clematis Street in West Palm Beach, Florida, where you cleaned up and mixed shampoos and other things.  Then, from there in high school across the lake in Palm Beach, Florida working for the Arty Huntington [ph.] estate.  The Huntingtons were the majority stockholders in Douglas Aircraft Company.  And, are working as sort of a gardener with two others; the adult, Mr. Eddie Dorsey; his son, Eddie, Jr. [Eddie Dorsey, Jr.]; and myself.  And, then with each summer my sister and I in tenth, eleventh, twelfth grade would get on the bus in West Palm Beach, Florida and ride to Ocean City, New Jersey, where we worked in a hotel there.  Then, returned to school for schooling during the day and after schooling job, or at least myself because she would work in the house at home.
Story_ID: 309121
Speaker 1: We're gonna put chronological year--chronological years to this as best you can remember.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: When your father [Edward Murray, Sr.] became principal there in Lakeland [Florida], what year was that, or approximate what year?
Speaker 2: That must have been in about 19--, let's see my oldest brother [Edward Murray, Jr.], let's see, 192--, about 1926.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, then what year did he become principal there in West Palm Beach [Florida], or approximately?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That must have been about 1936.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, this time you were six or seven years old?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, then he became principal in Mulberry [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Approximately what time?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-six [1946].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, you were born in '29 [1929]?
Speaker 2: Twenty-nine [1929].
Speaker 1: I'm wondering if you have any memories of neighbors or events in 1932, '33 [1933]?  The Depression [Great Depression] was in full rage.
Speaker 2: Yes.  In South Carolina, you knew your family because they lived in the general area and the farms were a distant--distance apart.  So, you did not get to know people other than through school, and through church, and through your family--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because there was no other way for the distance between those farms to be closed in as in urbanization.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, my mother's [Janie Williams Murray] folk, I got to know growing up with them.  My father's folk were further north in South Carolina, so I did not get to know them growing up.  And, a few schoolmates, we sat two to a seat in that broiling heat.  And, it is compulsory that you at least go to seventh grade and then after that, you could go on and work in the fields and so forth.  And, your family could take you there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was that compulsory for black kids as well as white?
Speaker 2: Black kid-  I don't know about white kids.  I doubt if, if it was.  But, for black kids, seventh grade--
Speaker 1: Was--?
Speaker 2: And, you could make it 'til then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  That's interesting.  The, just to illustrate, your--when your mother died, the family was, was living in Lakeland or had they moved back to--?
Speaker 2: In Lakeland.
Speaker 1: In Lakeland.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Living in Lakeland, Florida where my father was principal.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So, they must have married in South Carolina and he brought her to Lakeland.
Story_ID: 309122
Speaker 1: Are there any special memories of church, school, your brothers, and your sister--your brother [Edward Murray, Jr.] and your sister [Louise Murray Bowman], your father's [Edward Murray, Sr.] relationship that you can remember back in the, you know, 1934, '35 [1935]?
Speaker 2: It's amazing that some things stick in your mind.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: One, is a work ethic.  For instance, at the dinner table, the oldest child helped to serve the table.  The children ate last, of course.  The adults ate first.  The youngest child, fanned the flies.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: The middle child would assist one or the other as they got a little weary and bring water from the well, pour it into the large bucket there on the porch from which they fed from that bucket.  I remember not being large enough to help plow.  My brother who was two years older would ride the wagon and as they threw things into the wagon, he helped stack them.  I was too small, or young for that, so I sat in what they call crow, crow seat of the plow.  My Uncle Tom [Thomas Murray] would plow.  And, the plow had a V-shape to it, going down to the medal and a cross bar at the top.  I would sit on top of the cross bar to weight the plow down into the ground.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, that my uncle would not have to worry about digging it deep.  I was the weight that pushed the plow and then he would go.  A second job of sitting in that cradle was to make certain you plowed a straight row.  So, I would pick out a tree way on the other side of the field and it was my job to make sure that he plowed straight for that tree.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, there you could get a straight rows.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Other jobs were, of course, to bring water from the well and thus you would prime the pump.  There was a receptacle for the water and a receptacle with water in it to prime the pump.  You would pour the water in the prime and keep pumping the handle.  And, pretty soon you would get the flow going, and the water would come out, and you would take it into the house.  Schooling, I have very few remembrances except walking to school, it seemed to have been about five miles or four miles.  And, you walked around a swamp to get there, and the mosquitoes and the flies would follow you--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --but, you would have a group of you going.
Story_ID: 311757
Speaker 1: Wanted to just delve a little bit into that period when your father [Edward Murray, Sr.] and your two siblings [Edward Murray, Jr. and Louise Murray Bowman] have--now back in South Carolina and you're helping with the plowing--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Providing weight to the plowing, I should say.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, walking about five miles to--
Speaker 2: To school.
Speaker 1: To school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It may be a little too early for me to ask you to recollect what racial relations were like during that period.
Speaker 2: I--during the South Carolina, three years as a child, you seldom if ever encountered white people.  It was a total, totally separate society.  You may hear the elders talking.  But, at that time, children did not participate in grown-ups discussion.  So, you couldn't hear about it.  But, in the very atmosphere was clarity that there was racial separation.  For instance, the train track ran behind our house.  And, I remember the terror of the train squealing, putting on brakes, coming to a stop.  The conductor, a white man, came walking down to us kids, we were bring the cows home, and asked who left that piece of metal on the tracks.  Because the train had almost hit it and could've been derailed.  And, we all said we didn't know anything about it, and he threw a tirade.  And, from that point on about 5:00 P.M., 6:00 P.M. each day when we heard that train coming, we would all run away from the tracks and go to the front of the house or go out into the wilderness.  My brother and sister and I joke about it even today whenever there's a train of some kind.  So, the racial differentiation was there but, the racial contact was minimal because in the farm society you really had very little contact with the city or with white urbanization.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, on that farm, you raised all of your food?  You did not have a need to go into the general store for anything and so--?
Speaker 2: Precisely.  I don't remember ever, in those years, going with the family by buggy or horse and wagon to shop.  The clothes were homemade and everything.  I'm sure that maybe my mother [Janie Williams Murray] or grandmother did, but I don't remember the village.
Story_ID: 311758
Speaker 1: And, going to school, you were about to tell us about going to school and you had to walk five miles.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was that schoolhouse like?
Speaker 2: As you can well imagine--I just returned from Tanzania in Africa about a month ago.  And, it was if I had been transplanted.  The villages, the schools, the poverty, and I said, "Then that would mean that they are about a generation and a half behind where black America is now."  Because it seemed as if I had been transplanted back to my youth.  And, as we visited the schools there, and the mandatory age is seventh grade.  You must attend 'til seventh grade.  Then it was no longer mandatory.  And, the kids, to a large extent, went to work on the farms of their parents and everything like that.  And, the teachers, extraordinarily dedicated and the materials too few, and the respect was just utterly wonderful.  The respect that they had for the teachers and the principals, that essentially is what I recall of school in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, the walking the five miles, as you know, that would be difficult for kids today.
Speaker 2: Indeed it would.  But, we almost have to force ourselves to remember that we didn't get buses until the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, as we move from Hemingway, South Carolina back to Lakeland [Florida] and then to West Palm Beach, Florida, we walked to school each way there.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I remember in West Palm Beach, we would go from about 5th Street to about 11th Street, just about six blocks on Division Avenue.  So, it was not a long walk but there were some kids who came from 1st Street to 12th Street.  And, others who lived out in the northern part of Pleasant City [West Palm Beach, Florida], who would come from roughly 25th Street to 11th Street.  And, then when they wanted to go to the movie with only one theatre there, the Grand Theatre [West Palm Beach, Florida], they might walk twenty-five to thirty minutes to get to see the Saturday movie.  But, walking was pretty much something we all got used to.  When I had a job over in Palm Beach [Florida] from West Palm Beach, if I missed the truck that took us to work, then you walked there.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And, that's a good hour's walk.
Story_ID: 311759
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, are there any teachers that you can remember that particularly left a strong impression on you?  Either from first grade, second grade, on up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I would say beginning in third grade in West Palm Beach, Florida.  My father [Edward Murray, Sr.], mother [Janie Williams Murray], family, we moved to West Palm Beach, Florida.  Miss Ollie McCoy took us as her children.  She was not married.  She had no children.  She was a teacher.  She took us as her children.  She would stop by on the way from school and she would check with us on our homework.  Then, my brother [Edward Murray, Jr.] and I after she left, went on to our after school job.  And, my sister Louise [Louise Murray Bowman] would sort of keep the notes that she'd written.  Then, on that Saturday, that weekend, Miss McCoy would come by to see if we had completed all the work, our homework, and our assignments.  I remember Mrs. Clayton [ph.], who was our third grade English teacher; Mrs. Matthews [ph.] who taught math; Mr. Hector [ph.] who taught biology.  Miss Dyson [ph.], who among other things taught discipline because when you misbehaved in her class, she had a ruler.  And, you had to stand with your hands out.  And, she would go up on her toes coming down with that ruler.  So, you learned in Miss Dyson's class, and Miss Bead's [ph.] class too, pretty well behaved.  Mrs. Gill--Gillum [ph.] was music director and that was like heaven when you have those fifty to seventy-five voices.  And, your males either learn to sing tenor or to sing baritone or base, and the female, soprano or alto.  And, we would go to the different functions, black as well as white, and we would perform.  And, that would give us a chance to get a different environment and different exposure.  I remember Coach Neely [ph.], Coach Brooks [ph.], who coached the football team and the sports--the basketball team.  They were extremely fair and even when like I, you were a poor athlete, sat on the end of the bench, they would somehow see that you got a minute in the game.  Just enough so that you could get a little comfort in yourself.  I remember Miss Bertha Parrish who taught us later English.  Miss Savage who of all things taught us Latin.  And, she was determined that we, who hardly spoke English too well, would speak English well.  My father was the principal of the school.
Story_ID: 311760
Speaker 1: I remember Mr. Bernard Kinsey [sic. Ulysses Bradshaw Kinsey] who taught us political science and he was an advocate of civil rights and insisted that we learn as much of our history as could be available to us.
Speaker 2: Now, I can remember that Bernard Kinsey [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey]-
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Here, who's also a HistoryMaker.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: His family is from West Palm Beach [Florida]--
Speaker 1: You bet.
Speaker 2: And, is this--
Speaker 1: His father [Ulysses Bradshaw Kinsey]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Later became principal of the high school [Industrial High School; U.B. Kinsey/Palmview Elementary School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, the high school was later made an elementary school.  And, it has expanded tenfold.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, they have named it U.B. Kinsey Elementary School.  It covers several blocks.  Two weeks ago I was in West Palm Beach, Florida addressing my home church, Payne Chapel AME Church [West Palm Beach, Florida].  And, when I saw how that school that we grew up in, had not only particularized to an elementary school but it has expanded geographically and it has schools, art and everything else going for it.  I was amazed.  Mr. Kinsey, of course, died over the last twelve months.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And, his son, Bernard worked with IBM [sic. Xerox Corporation], and he is no longer with them but he is independently well to do, has his own company, and is a tribute to that generation that followed ours.
Story_ID: 311761
Speaker 1: Those were subjects that I keep hearing over and over again that many black kids in many rural counties in the South, simply were not privy to.  But, obviously, you and members of your family were fortunate enough to be privy to this.  Where--did you have any particularly favorite subjects or subjects that you were better in than others?
Speaker 2: In school, and high school [Industrial High School; U.B. Kinsey/Palmview Elementary School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida], in West Palm Beach, Florida, I think I have always been a history buff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, it is only when I became older that I realized we were denied our history.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: We used hand-me-down books from the white schools.  We sat two to a seat.  And, the main thing, almost the only thing we had going for us was that teacher.  And, the teachers of that generation, the senior generation were determined that we were going to learn.  The teachers of the Baby Boomer Generation, those forty-five and above, had a different challenge.  The Generation X teachers, those twenty-five and above, had almost rebellious children.  And, the generation next group, twenty-five and under, dear me, 50 percent of them will not even finish high school, and has a 40 percent dropout rate in tenth grade.  But, I enjoyed immensely, history and political science.  The exact sciences were arithmetic and all and all, and managed to get by there if you worked hard.  But, other than catching the fire of the teacher or having a natural bent, you would have to find what you liked--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, supplement it with your dreams.
Story_ID: 311762
Speaker 1: Would I be wrong in saying that because your father [Edward Murray, Sr.] was a principal that your family, relatively speaking, would be considered a middle class family there?  In other words, you had privileges to some of the things, they say, sharecropper families may not have access to.
Speaker 2: I think you would be right in saying that.  Of course, middle class now means middle income.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Middle class at that time would mean opportunities and exposure.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because here education is a generation old.  My dad was the first college graduate.  And, so, education was just an assumption in our house.  With black youth at that time, it was kind of an assumption generally, 'cause college for my class was just thirteenth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a good 80 percent of our kids go on to college and to complete.  Many of them to Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] many of them to Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] --
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Many of them to the schools in Atlanta [Georgia].  North Carolina had five state schools for blacks.  It was unusual.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, you had to have a job after school and you had to go on to college.  Then, too, the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] was in effect as the war [World War II, WWII] ended in 1945.  So, we had two years in school where veterans were coming back.  And, if they went on and finished high school and went to college, they could do so under the G.I. Bill.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, those factors were coming in.  But, I would say the fact that my daddy was educated and an educator was an advantage to those with whom he came in contact.
Speaker 1: Right.  Let me ask you about your older brother, Edward [Edward Murray, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did he go on to finish high school and finish college?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When we came to Florida, my dad--to West Palm Beach [Florida] rather, leaving Lakeland, Florida to West Palm Beach, my dad started both my brother and me in third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My brother should have been a year ahead.  But, the schooling wasn't quite adequate to get him ready so, he just said, "Okay, both of you will start in third grade."  So, we graduated together from twelfth grade.  He went to school at Morris Brown [Morris Brown College] in Atlanta, Georgia.  I, to Florida A and M.  And, a year later, he transferred to Florida A and M.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we graduated there together and each of us went into the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, both of you went into--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He made it a career (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Of course.  And--
Speaker 2: Yes, he made it a career.
Speaker 1: And, what about your sister, Louise [Louise Murray Bowman].  She finished high school and college?
Speaker 2: She finished school, went on to Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach [Florida].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Then, came back to West Palm Beach and taught for a period of time on the Everglades.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the home of the Seminole Indians [Native American] and so forth and so on; the Glades, the Swampland.  Then, she later taught in Lake Park, Florida, and then later in West Palm Beach, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What made me think of that, of course, I know the Kinseys, you know, when they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she taught under him [Ulysses Bradshaw Kinsey].
Story_ID: 311763
Speaker 1: We've talked about memorable teachers.  How about some of the memorable students who were in school with you, either in elementary or junior high or high school?
Speaker 2: You know, I really think that our class was a one of a kind class.  When I was back home two weeks ago, and got to see our classmates, and to talk with many who were either ahead of us or behind us, there was some consensus that the class of '47 [1947], the high school class, and the class of '51 [1951] the college class, from West Palm Beach [Florida] were totally unusual.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: I think it was a watershed and a turning point between the agrarian farm society mentality and the urbanized city mentality.  Between the work ethic and the sense of entitlement ethic.  I think that I could call names of those who went on and excelled in their fields.  Then look at the classes immediately following us and you could pick out one or two or three.  But, if you generalize, you could not say about them what you could say about that 1947 class.  These are hardworking ethical people whose ethic is an achievement and who are going on to make us proud to take nothing and to make something out of it.  They were a great class.
Speaker 1: Could you give us the name of that high school?
Speaker 2: Industrial, I-N-D-U-S-T-R-I-A-L, Industrial High School, West Palm Beach, Florida.  It is now the U.B. Kinsey Elementary School [U.B. Kinsey/Palmview Elementary School of the Arts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, the high school is in several other locations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where you a student who enjoyed class?  I know you enjoyed history.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But, how about some of those other subjects?
Speaker 2: You know when you look at options in school, did you enjoy school?  That's like asking a fish, what is water?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You're just caught up in the environment and until you ask the question it would not have occurred to me.  School was life.  Do you enjoy breathing?  Yes.  Did you enjoy studying?  Well, yes.  Did you enjoy work after school?  Yes.  Did you enjoy when the guys from the neighborhood gathered on one front porch?  Maybe our front porch one day, and another front--and sang or talked--told jokes and so forth?  Yes.  Did you enjoy the Boy Scouts?  Yes.  Did you enjoy junior church and maybe being the junior pastor?  Yes.  These were things that were breath itself.  There wasn't time to look at the negative because the negative really never came before you.  We did not have the challenges that generation next, and Generation X particularly have.
Story_ID: 311764
Speaker 1: Let's talk about what the, your church life growing up, was, was, was like.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Teachers and preachers were set asides.  The only place that black people congregate by and large en masse today, is the church.  And, then it was then even more so of a place you gather, you muster, you plan, you find your sanity.  That preacher typically was of help to his people and, and 98 percent of the preachers were male, at that time.  And, he was literate.  He could write.  Preacher, you could always tell the preacher because he had pencils in the pocket--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --of his coat.  He didn't have pens, pencils and they were sharpened to a fine point.  And, the led pointed upwards.  If he had three pencils, he was a big preacher, four pencils a bigger preacher, five pencils a big--he was literate.  So, people who were illiterate could come to him.  He would assist them in legal papers, or he would assist them in writing letters or assist them in filling out their draft papers and so forth on.  The preacher was quite a leader.  Now, they did not have seminary training because even when I was in seminary [Southern California School of Theology; Claremont School of Theology, Claremont, California] in the '60s [1960s], 1961 to 1964, 85 percent of black preachers did not have seminary training.  So, they were gifted story tellers.  They were gifted and respected servants.  There came a generation of preacher that began to disillusion me a bit because I'd always wanted to be a preacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, then they emerged that preacher, that black preacher, who I thought should be out helping his people.  And, he became somewhat obsessed with owning a Cadillac, and being the best paid person in town, biggest house, biggest ego.  And, that kind of pushed me away.  That was before Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK)] era, of course.  And, I should've seen that there were quite a few MLKs in churches doing great things.  But, I was judgmental and stayed away from ministry, going on to college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], four years, thinking of perhaps law.  Then, with the draft upon graduation, having to go into one branch of service, being given about thirty days to decide or else they send you to the [U.S.] Army.  I chose the [U.S.] Air Force, and sort of ran away from God's calling for about ten years.  And, finally, said yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The--you just called attention to a point where I've been remised, and that is, I know you were a member of your local A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal] out--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There in West Palm Beach [Florida].  I should've gotten the name of that.
Speaker 2: Payne Chapel, P-A-Y-N-E, Chapel AME Church [Payne Chapel AME Church], West Palm Beach, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you said you had always wanted to be a minister.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What--can you give us the earliest time when you said, "Gee whiz, well maybe I'd like to be a minister?"
Speaker 2: You know, I think our callings are born to us and within us.  I can't remember a time in my life when I didn't aspire to ministry.  I remember when we moved to West Palm Beach, Florida and I was in third grade, the kerosene stove in the kitchen caught on fire.  And, my brother [Edward Murray, Jr.] and my sister [Louise Murray Bowman] were out in the backyard putting sand in a container to bring it in and throw the sand on the fire to put it out.  And, I remember my brother coming through and yelling at me, he was carrying the sand, "This is no time for praying.  It's time to be carrying sand."  I was on my knees asking God to put out the fire.  And, oh, how right he was.  And, it is kept in my memory by way of a service industry for ministry.  It's a time for putting out fires, and then there's a time for praying, then there's a time for singing.  For everything there is a time.  But, talking to God and being with God has been with me the seventy-six years of my existence.
Story_ID: 309123
Speaker 1: Now, you were telling us that you had felt motivated toward being a minister most of your life.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us, can you remember when you first felt this urge and said to yourself, I want to be a minister?
Speaker 2: I think the question would have to be, when did you not want to be a minister?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because, I never remember any aspiration, grabbing me and holding me like that.  I came to a point of decision while in the [U.S.] Air Force following an experience in which George Burbish [ph.], white young adult male from South Carolina, of all places, and I, pilot radar observant, backseat in F-89 [Northrop F-89 Scorpion] jet interceptor, stationed Oxnard Air Force Base, California [Oxnard Air Force Base, Camarillo, California], rolling down the runway to take off, did not negotiate the takeoff, the nose wheel collapsed and the nose tank erupted into fire.  The plane was on fire.  The canopy overhead was jammed.  Normally, you pull the lever and the canopy blows off, then you can pull the lever and bail out if you're in the sky.  On the ground, the canopy malfunctioned.  He was able to get out of the plane because the front cockpit was open.
Story_ID: 309124
Speaker 1: And, the rear cockpit, I was trapped with only a small opening between the canopy and the frame of the cockpit.  I remember as clearly as this moment is, the voice that spoke to me, "Be calm, take off your helmet, take off your parachute, take off your lifejacket, you may rest.  Now, stick your head through that whole going out backwards, push, push," until I was free.  I ran down the wing of the aircraft to escape the fire to jump off when I heard, George Burbish [ph.], my friend, yelling, "Chip, Chip [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray]."  I looked and he was like a barn fire on fire.  I ran to him, tackled him and rolled him over as we had learned in the Boy Scouts until the flames were out.  By that time help had arrived.  They took him to the hospital; later shipped him to San Antonio [Texas] to the burn specialty center [at Brooke Army Medical Center] there.  He wrote back to Oxnard [Oxnard Air Force Base, Camarillo, California] and requested that they please fly me out to visit with him in the hospital.  They did.  I stood by the side of his bed.  He said, "I just wanted to take your hand and thank you."  A few days later, he died because he had third degree burns to about 80 percent of his body.  They, of course, sited me with the Soldier's Medal for saving him.  But, that was a turning point in the decision making.  Three years later, my wife [Bernardine Cousin Murray] and I deliberated and she said, "Yes, let's go."  Because I had to decide then 'cause--whether or not I make it a career or not.  And, we put in--I put in my resignation because I, I was blessed with being a regular commission officer.  Not a reserved position but regular which most of the guys really wanted it.  And, we got out of the [U.S.] Air Force.  I went to school at Claremont [Southern California School of Theology; Claremont School of Theology, Claremont, California] and got my doctorate there and started ministry.  But, that incident triggered the response, the yearning that had been there all the while.  I don't think I would've ever been fulfilled doing anything else.  I would have done my best but it would not have been the utter fulfillment that ministry has brought.
Story_ID: 309125
Speaker 1: I wanted to hear about your youth years as a Boy Scout--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It seemed that you enjoyed many of those things--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: As a young man.  And, we did not hear enough about that period.  And, then we'll go back up to your going off to college.  But, as a Boys Scout, what made--motivated you?
Speaker 2: When you look at the institutions that offered themselves to youth, males particularly, an endangered species.  You have the nuclear family, the extended family, the church, the school, and the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America].  Josh Bakin [ph.] was our scout master, a man of modest learning, blue collar worker, but a heart as big as the universe.  The scouting executive was Nathaniel Adams who was in charge of the scouting movement in all the city for black troops.  Our sponsor was Payne Chapel AME Church [West Palm Beach, Florida], Troop Twenty.  With that one adult, we who were there were responsible for each other and to each other.  Thus, the sixteen year olds were the seniors.  Fourteen, thirteen year olds the middlers.  Twelve year olds coming on board.  We would take bicycles and ride twenty miles up to Jupiter, Florida and camp out for the weekend.  And, there was no worry about our safety or our wellbeing.  We would go out to the Glades [Everglades] riding bicycles.  Or, we would meet at the church, or go out into the backyard a pitch tents.  We would collect scrap metals during the war years, patriotism.  You could sell them and that money could be used to help the troops.  We worked to get our uniforms, and we became a brotherhood.   The Scouts, the Boy Scout Troop Twenty were the classmates, and the under classmates, and the above classmates.  And, those you went to college with are those who scattered abroad, and those you met later in the [U.S.] military.  But, I know the scouting movement has changed a lot and it's rather difficult to recruit black youth to the scouting movement.  But, then it was a lifesaver and a value for a mentor and many a scout master has changed many a life.
Story_ID: 309126
Speaker 1: You went to Industrial High School [U.B. Kinsey/Palmview Elementary School of the Arts] in Palm Breach--Beach, West Palm Beach [Florida].  And, as you've indicated many of your classmates were overachievers in that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: --class.  How did you decide that you wanted to go the Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Because we got a scholarship.  They call it the Lewis scholarship, L-E-W-I-S.  You--they would send you to school for four years at Florida A&M and upon completion of school, you would have to teach--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --four years.  And, that would automatically repay the scholarship.  Now, can you believe how much the amount of the scholarship was?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Four hundred dollars a year.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That was a sixteen hundred dollar scholarship for four years.  And, that won't get you a semester in modern--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) True.
Speaker 2: --colleges.
Speaker 1: It obviously did not include meals (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.  So, what happened, I took the exam, passed the Lewis scholarship test and was given this scholarship.  When we graduated, I would've had to go into teaching except the draft law required that you serve in the [U.S.] military.  Two years later, they changed it a little.  I think to four years or something like that.  And, I selected the [U.S.] Air Force.  And, while in the Air Force, I decided I did not wish to teach.  So, with the blessings of my wife [Bernardine Cousin Murray], we agreed the repay the Lewis scholarship in cash.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we saved up and repaid the sixteen hundred dollars and they gave me a release form that I had paid my obligations and was free to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, the--you all--all--still always been a teacher.  Almost all of your life (laughter).
Speaker 2: Bless you.
Story_ID: 309127
Speaker 1: What was life like at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Florida A&M was in transition.  Because as A&M implies, agriculture and mechanical.  The colleges would prepare you for those two careers.  I remember a plot of land adjacent to the campus where they grew corn and other crops.  And, yet I don't think I remember anybody majoring in agriculture and mechanics.  The fields were well kept and so forth.  But, everybody was in the liberal arts segment of the school.  A&M had an orientation session which makes me to this day, thank God for them, because they realized most of those kids come into college really were underprepared.  So, that orientation session would be a catch-up session, where those who had come from underserved schools or with marginal grades would be tutored, mentored, and brought up the standards and then entered the freshman class.  And, that was a part of the freshman orientation.  I was blessed, I came out of school [Industrial High School; U.B. Kinsey/Palmview Elementary School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida] with fairly good grades.  So, I did not have to take that orientation session.  But, I know quite a few of my buddies were benefited by it.  So, we went there and we found the same value system on the part of the teachers there.  I am still in touch with Dr. Emmett Bashful, who taught us history and political science.  And is now in his late nineties.  We stay in touch.  I'll give you an example of the type of spirit, he put us in his car, four of us, and drove us to Louisiana so we could encounter the schools in Louisiana; Grambling [Grambling College; Grambling State University, Grambling Louisiana], and Louisiana State [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], and so forth and so on.  And, see they were about.  Took us on several other tours and helped us to find housing while we were there.  And, really got us interested.  So, that in civil rights we were constantly there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A&M was at a time when you had the daily chapel.  So, we, all the students would muster in the auditorium and we would have chapel each day.  Just as in high schools, there was chapel where you'd sing songs and the glee club would sing.  I joined the male glee club and that exposed me to some degree of travel.  I was not an athlete and I, I admired them so much.  I was in the student government, became president of the student council in my senior year and was on it for the other three years; joined the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity because the four Greek fraternities and the four Greek sororities were sort of the prominent groups--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Of that time.  And, thank God, Dr. William Gray [William Gray, Jr.] whose son [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III] is now head of the--
Speaker 1: United Negro College (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) United Negro College Fund was president of Florida A&M at that time.  And, he was followed by Dr. William Gore [George W. Gore, Jr.], and so forth and so on.  But, Florida A&M was an experience that was life altering for all of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The other schools, Florida State U [Florida State College for Women; Florida State University], which is in Tallahassee [Florida] was white female, now its co-ed, University of Florida in Gainesville [Florida] and all.  But, the Florida Rattlers and Grambling became the two prominent football teams.  And, basketball we could--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Hold our own.  But there was nothing like the football team--
Speaker 1: Jake Gaither.
Speaker 2: And the Marching 100.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Mr. Foster [HistoryMaker William Foster] directing that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They were prominent.
Story_ID: 309128
Speaker 1: So we don't skip over it, when did you met your wife and how did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: In ninth grade in high school [Industrial High School; U.B. Kinsey/Palmview Elementary School of the Arts] in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Reverend S.A. Cousin [Sylvester A. Cousin] came from Tampa [Florida] to West Palm Beach as the pastor of Payne Chapel AME Church [West Palm Beach, Florida].  It was there that met Bernardine [Bernardine Cousin Murray].  The junior/senior prom, I took Bernardine to the senior prom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At that time, you managed to rent a tuxedo and, of course, you had to show up a good thirty minutes early to pick up your date because the father would give you the third degree.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Absolutely.
Speaker 2: What time you coming?  What time is, so forth so and so, that went along with any type of date that you might have.  And, none of my generation knew what a date was.  You have the junior/senior prom and maybe a dance at the school.  You would dance if one of the ladies would say yes.  If you could dance.  The veterans coming back from World War II [WWII], kind of made us even more into the shade because they was so sophisticated and had extra money and knew how to talk to girls and all.  But, that was Bernardine and I--
Speaker 1: I don't want you to go too far on that because I wanna know how you met.  In other words, some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the church.
Speaker 1: --at some point in time, you saw her and bells and whistles went off and so forth.  I wanna know about that time (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, Bernardine, her brother [Philip R. Cousin, Sr.] and I were good friends.  He is presently a Bishop within the A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal].  He was younger than I by four years or five years, and I was the pastor of the church, he was the assistant pastor
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we were as big brother, little brother.  With Bernardine I would tend to say I was such a square, I would not have known how to approach her even with puppy love.  I wasn't even a puppy.  My brother [Edward Murray, Jr.] tried to teach me some degree of sophistication.  My sister [Louise Murray Bowman] laughed at me.  But, I was as square as a city block.  It was as the years went by, that I said, "Lord, have mercy.  That's the one."
Speaker 1: The bells started going off.
Speaker 2: The bells and whistles--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --were slow but they were there.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right.  Now, when did you two, when did you two decide to get married?  What year was that?
Speaker 2: June 25, 1958.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was stationed in California, drove to Miami, Florida where her, her father and mother lived.  She was a teacher in West Palm Beach, and we were married in Miami, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then she came to California with me and we've been together since that time.
Story_ID: 309129
Speaker 1: Now, there was a time, of course, when you were in the [U.S.] Air Force and you had a decision to make, whether to make the Air Force (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --a career, or to move on.
Speaker 2: Yes, 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, in 1961 you prayed over it, you two talked it over.
Speaker 2: Yes.  After that aircraft accident, we pretty well knew.  But, I had some special assignments that kept delaying the process.  But, we certainly knew that our ministry would be in ministry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, the incident took place in '58 [1958], and the discharge took place in '61 [1961], 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, that's when you turned your life over to pastoring?  You wanted to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --pastor to people who needed your help.  When--how did that start, now?  You were starting out as a young minister, where did that start?
Speaker 2: It started with school.  When I got out of the Air Force--
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 2: Yes.  I went to the School of Theology at Claremont [Southern California School of Theology; Claremont School of Theology, Claremont, California] C-L-A-R-E-M-O-N-T, Claremont, California.  I was its first full-time black student there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Housing was a real challenge.  In the Air Force we stayed on base because normally we could not find housing in the city.  The racial barriers there.  And, when we went to seminary, one of the white student, whom I shall never forget, had on campus housing but he gave up his apartment, Apartment D17 and allowed my wife [Bernardine Cousin Murray] and me to move in and he went and found a place in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, we stayed on campus.  I found a side job.  I had the G.I. Bill [Serviceman's Readjustment Act of 1944] plus and side job and we were able to meet the expenses and to go.  I did full load each season, twenty-one units so that in those three years I was able to put the equivalent of four years and went from there.  I am grateful for Dr. E.C. Caldwell who was the president of the School of Theology, E.C. Caldwell.  I'm grateful for Dr. K. Morgan Edwards, these were white professors and professionals.  Dr. K. Morgan Edwards opened up doors for me to address white congregations, to address seminars.  He took me under his wing as his own.  Dr. John Cobb, C-O-B-B, who was a theologian and one of the three people, along with Dr. K. Morgan Edwards, who had to sign off on my dissertation.  Some of these professors are still living in there and we are in touch but that was a very supportive system.
Speaker 1: You was, so the only black in the school of religion there, theology?
Speaker 2: I was the first full-time black and I think in my second year there came an African and two American blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 309130
Speaker 1: And, you made it out in three years.
Speaker 2: Yes, '64 [1964] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, your first four years course--
Speaker 2: My first assignment--
Speaker 1: Yeah, your first assignment?
Speaker 2: Was Pomona, California.  We started out with a handful.  I thought it was eight, but one of the older members said it was about twelve people--
Speaker 1: Twelve people.
Speaker 2: And, we grew to 150.  They found housing for me because we did not have a parsonage at that time.  And, it's strange how things change.  My wife [Bernardine Cousin Murray] and I laugh about it today because we're on the sidewalk in front of the church and that was our first visit and one of the officers of the church said, 'cause they were discussing salary, "Ain't nothing cheap about me."  He said, "I'm willing to pay him fifteen dollars a week."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: We said, "Fine," you know.  "I'll do whatever we--."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I am so grateful with my family; my wife, my son [Drew Murray], that money has never been an essential other than being an essential for requirements.  But, it has never been as a God.  Because if you give God your best, the Lord will (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He will take care of--
Speaker 2: --provide the rest.  So, I was three years there in Pomona.  We grew.  We left with the parsonage two and a third acres of ground so that a new church could be built, and so forth and so on.  Then went five years to Kansas City [Kansas] pastoring at Trinity AME Church [Trinity African Methodist Episcopal] in Kansas City, Kansas.  These of course were the civil rights days--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The dawning of the civil rights days.  And, while in Pomona I was chairman of Pomona CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, we picketed Bank of America for about two years.  Their hiring practices.  Kansas City (cough) excuse me, we worked with the civil rights issues there and so forth and so on.  Keeping the church at the center meanwhile growing in property and in civic concerns.  But, then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me, let me go and ask you, we're talking about 1964.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, you're graduating from Claremont College [Southern California School of Theology; Claremont School of Theology, Claremont, California]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The civil rights, the Brown v. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]--
Speaker 2: Yes, '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: At '54 [1954].  Now, it's ten years later and we see the Civil Rights Movement growing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were things like there in Pomona during that period?  I mean, what were the feelings among not only--maybe I should start by asking you, what was the racial makeup of your congregation?
Speaker 2: Our congregation, we were blessed in that white members through the School of Theology of Claremont came in support.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: Three of the professors came, worked with the church, and their families and others came.  It was 90-95 percent black, of course.  And, the whites came.  The Latinos were beginning to surge into the city but were not as predominate in Pomona as they might be as of this tick of the watch.  They were well trained, middle income, shall we say middle class blacks who were in the church.  It was a very modest church.  We took burlap bags, our crocus sacks, our generations called them, and used them for drapes over the windows.  My sister [Louise Murray Bowman] gave us her dresser and we used that as a pulpit.  We found an old piano and that, that was used there.  We drilled ourselves in having a choir and there were wooden benches.  So, we, we were there and ready to go.
Story_ID: 309131
Speaker 1: You've given us the outline of the small church there in Pomona [California].  And, you had started off with twelve people and you began to build that church.  Tell us about what you did.
Speaker 2: We got a loud speaker and drove through the neighborhoods.  J.D. Simmons, one of the members that I inherited, praise God, and J.D. Simmons and Vivian Simmons to this very day, Ferdinand [Ferdinand Bugg] and Mae Bugg, Ferdinand has slipped on.  But, we drove through the neighborhood telling people about the church.  And, we got leaflets and put them on the front porches of churches and told them about it.  And, we began to grow and to build and to go out into the city to serve.  As we served, we began to get some degree of name identity.  And, the Pomona newspaper began to carry some of the features.  So, that helped us to recruit people into the church.  We had coalitions with the Baptists there so that we could do civil right things together.  And, with several white churches that we began to do things together to form a coalition.  It was a very inspiring day in a time of growth and learning for me.  Because a good part of the civil rights revolution took place while I was in the [U.S.] Air Force.  Now, I went in, in 1951 and the Air Force integrated in 1948, the [U.S.] military integrated in 1948.  So, even though discrimination was not legal in the military, it still takes time to get out of that windmill.  And, we encountered some degree of discrimination.  Some would even say blacks were not intelligent enough to fly.  Or, black were not intelligent enough to do this, or didn't want you on the submarines--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: On the [U.S.] Navy unless you were a cook, or so forth and so on.  The civil rights struggle was a time so Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death, the Kennedys' [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy] their death, the legislation through Harry Truman [President Harry S. Truman], these were things that you, you really could praise God for and enjoy.
Speaker 1: But, you were, your church was earning a reputation as adamant--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In the civil rights struggle.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, you joined forces with whites in Pomona and so forth to do this?
Speaker 2: And, the Claremont [Southern California School of Theology; Claremont School of Theology, Claremont, California] community was extremely supportive because we had lines of communication with them.  And, they were, they tended to be a very liberal orientated mentality.  The seminary was a part of USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] and then it broke away and became an independent school of theology.  But, the professors were very, very open to desegregation--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, integration.
Story_ID: 309132
Speaker 1: There came a time when you were ready to move on to Kansas City [Kansas] in Trinity College [sic. Trinity African Methodist Episcopal Church, Kansas City, Kansas] there.  What prompted that and what was it like moving to--?
Speaker 2: In the African Methodist Episcopal church, the bishop assigns you, one year at a time, at the annual conference.  And, I had served three years there when Bishop Howard Thomas Primm said, "I want you to move on to a church I have in the Midwest."  And, it was Trinity AME Church.  It was some five hundred members and I naturally said, "Yes."  And, we transitioned to Kansas City, Kansas.  And, that was in 1966 and we were there until 1971.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what was it like there in Kansas City?  Did you continue your advocacy on civil rights matters?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: What was the congregation like?
Speaker 2: Because to do--we had to continue the struggle.  The Midwest was an experience in simplicity.  The Far West was like an open book, even today the book is still being written.  The Midwest, the book was fairly written.  The church was on a brick street, for instance, and that would indicate to you the reasonably settled mentality.  The people in the church were very kind to us.  The parsonage was right next door to the church.  So, that indicates old school right there.  Because parsonages were located next to church and pastors stayed in parsonage not in independent homes.  And we lived in the parsonage.  We worked with the Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] dream.  We were blessed to purchase the two houses adjacent to the church.  Not only to expand parking but to have youth recreation, basketball, and things like that so we could attract a younger crowd to the church.  Because at that time the black church generally was made up of us seniors.  And, there, I came about 35 years of age, 34 years of age, and we had to find a way to recruit the young people.  Particularly with the revolution that was going on in black communities and in non-black communities.  So, we got involved with the King movement in the schools, meeting with the board of education frequently, going to schools, a group of ministers, making certain demands, mustarding black in the park, voter registration and getting people out to votes, this type of thing.  And, we were able to make a contribution.
Story_ID: 309133
Speaker 1: Now, how long did you stay in Kansas City [Kansas] at Trinity AME [Trinity African Methodist Episcopal Church]?
Speaker 2: Five years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we're now in 1971.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, where did you go next?
Speaker 2: Seattle, Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Seattle, Washington was frontier country.  Seattle, Washington was undergoing an economic challenge because the home base of Boeing [The Boeing Company].  That was 1971 and the economy was in a bit of danger.  There was not excessive numbers of blacks there and those that were there were reasonably skilled to highly skilled.  The church I think had about a thousand to twelve hundred active members.  It had had a distinguished line of pastors.  And, when I came on board when the civil right struggle was in its zenith and heyday.  We started out with a mission to build housing for the poor and for the economically challenged.  We first built senior housing, the Texada Apartments [Seattle, Washington], and then we built larger housing.  Because HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] was discovering the black communities and HUD was discovering--Housing and Urban Development Community Redevelopment Agency was just cranking up in concept.  And, so, if churches were willing to form and 501(c)(3) corporation and to apply for funding, you could pretty well be assured that you would get it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we then needed to go to the banking community, and form coalitions with them.  And, since we had the backing of the government for the money, all we needed was creditability and to do the paperwork for the banking community.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: And, so, we began to do civic things to purchase the property north of the church, a filling station was there.  To purchase the property south of the church and to put up a youth center there.  And, we were just carrying the dream to its zenith or its higher point.  The people were very reasonable, caring, and civic oriented.  A good 85 percent were on the poll for register voters.  And, the isolation allowed you to do creative things because your next church was in Portland [Oregon].  Then, you had to go all the way down to San Francisco [California] out to Cor- well, out to Tacoma [Washington], Portland, and then San Francisco.  So, being isolated there, you were free to experiment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, those six years there--
Speaker 1: What was--?
Speaker 2: Gave us an opportunity to go to the next height in civil rights and in spiritual growth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the name of that church in Seattle, Washington?
Speaker 2: First African Methodist Episcopal Church [Seattle, Washington], First A.M.E. Church, Seattle.  It was the oldest black church in the Pacific Northwest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of the first pioneering black church in the Pacific Northwest.
Speaker 1: And, you stayed there until?
Speaker 2: Six years, 1977 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy-seven [1977].  Okay.
Story_ID: 309134
Speaker 1: In 1977 they asked you to come to Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was assigned by Bishop H.H. Brookins [Hamel Hartford Brookins].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I remember him.
Speaker 2: I had been assigned to Seattle [Washington] by Bishop Harrison J. Bryant [Harrison James Bryant].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then when his terms was up, Bishop H.H. Brookins assigned me to First AME Church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME)], Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had pastored there for thirteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then he became a bishop in the church, and several pastors followed him there.  And, then I came in 1977.  First AME Church, Los Angeles is the oldest black church in Los Angeles, founded by a former slave woman named Biddy Mason, B-I-D-D-Y, Biddy Mason [Bridget "Biddy" Mason] who were brought out with some two thousand slaves from Mississippi to the San Fernando Valley [California].  She chose to ask to get permission to walk because symbolically she did not want to ride into slavery.  She was that type of militant spirit.  So, they allowed her to serve as a sheepherder.  So, she walked with the sheep for thousands of miles to the San Fernando Valley.  When the proc- Emancipation Proclamation was signed in 1861 [sic. 1863] and the slaves were freed, the master decided to take the slaves back to Mississippi, which remained slave territory in their thinking.  And, Biddy Mason was able to escape in the Valley here and was given protective custody in the Los Angeles County jail, of all things.  They--she was a slave who was free.  But, the master wanted to take them back, so they gave her protective custody.  And, then when the caravan left, she was released.  She was a midwife and earned her income by accepting property for payment for a midwife, midwifery service to whites.  She ultimately became the first wealthy black woman in the territory of California.  And, one of the first wealth black people, period, in what was then the territory of California before it became a state.  Then as Los Angeles moved south from it prior location, the land that she had been given for midwifery, became very, very valuable.  And, and, so, she became quite well to do.  Downtown on 5th [Street], 6th [Street] and Spring Street, is a tribute to Biddy Mason.  The Biddy Mason Memorial Wall next to a multi-million dollar business development that was dedicated perhaps some fifteen, twenty years ago.  Biddy Mason started the African Methodist Episcopal Church in her home in 1872.  They met in her home.  As they grew, she moved to another location.  The third location was at 8th [Street] and Towne [Street] which is downtown, now.  And, it became an historical monument.  It later burned down.  But, its fourth location is its present location at 2270 South Harvard Boulevard.  Biddy Mason had been attending the United Methodist Church downtown but she knew of the African Methodist Episcopal church.  The African Methodist Episcopal church is the oldest black denomination in North American also started by a slave (cough) excuse me, Richard Allen who along with Absalom Jones led a walk out of the white Methodist Church in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church in 1787 [sic. 1793].  They bought an old blacksmith's shop, moved it to 8th and Op- moved it to a street in Philadelphia and that was the beginning of the African Methodist Episcopal church denomination.  It became incorporated in 1816.  Biddy Mason in 1872 said, "I want to be closer to my people and work and worship."  So, she started the A.M.E. church in her home--
Story_ID: 309135
Speaker 1: The former pastor, Dr. Fred Stevens [ph.] had procured a parsonage--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --down in South Citrus Avenue about fifteen minutes at most from the church, so we had housing.  At the time, there was still living room furniture to be placed there.  But, we had a comfortable roof and we could concentrate upon the church rather than having to worry about housing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just as there was housing in Seattle [Washington] and Kansas City [Kansas].  The challenge with First AME Church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), Los Angeles, California] was the challenge that black churches, mainline churches were meeting in the '70s [1970s] and that was to transition from a white-oriented environment to a black-oriented environment.  From a white liturgical format to a black celebratory format.  I wondered if we could not aim for the head, the heart, and the feet.  If we had to differentiate, head church metaphysical, a heart totally emotional, or feet shouting from (unclear), why couldn't we in the body, embody, intellect, emotions and outward display of enthusiasm.  So, we try to outline a program of blacking up Methodism because the Methodist church that we came out of was reinventing itself; the United Methodist church rather than the Methodist Episcopal church.  And, we were the African Methodist Episcopal church having come out of them, out of the Methodist Episcopal church.  So, we had to do something about the imaging.  Above the choirs head at First AME Church as a beautiful Italian painting of Joseph the father, Mary the mother, and Jesus the infant.  But, they were European.  And, we have every to believe that if you're going to assign an ethnicity to Jesus, it would have to be black or at least Afro-Asiatic.  Revelation talks about the Savior as having brazen feet, brass feet, and kinky hair or wooly hair.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The narrative of the birth tells that after the baby Jesus is born, his parents are hiding Him from the wrath of Herod who is killing all of the babies because he'd heard that a Savior was being born.  So, his parents don't take him to London [England] or Paris [France], white territory.  They take him to Egypt.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, we know that the father of history, Herodotus in 500 B.C. tells us that the Egyptians were black.  And, Josephus the Jewish historian around the century that Jesus was born, tells us that the Egyptians were black.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, the Sphinx at Giza [Great Sphinx of Giza] has the features of blacks.  We have every reason to believe that they'd take this black child to a black country because you can hide chocolate with chocolate.  But, you can't hid vanilla with chocolate.  Then this Jesus and the Jews of a certain era were black.  His ancestors traced down through Solomon, who was the child--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Of David and Bathsheba, the Hittite and the Hittites were North Africans.  We have every reason to believe that she was black.  And, as you come down through a thousand years tracing Jesus there's every reason to believe Jesus was and is black.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It matters a lot to those who were worshiping white symbols caught up as under figures in a white culture regarded by the founding fathers of our [U.S.] Constitution and of our nation as chattel, as property, as inferior.  The first five presidents of our nation owned slaves.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] had to struggle with setting slaves free to save the Union, or to keeping them in slavery to slave the Union.  And, he finally did the moral thing, even saying that blacks were the balance of power in winning the Civil War.  If it had not been for the black troops--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the North would have lost the Civil War.
Story_ID: 309136
Speaker 1: So, there is this Italian art piece that had been given to the church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), Los Angeles, California] and we would start with that.  One of the ministerial students was artistic, an artist.  And, one night, very late, about 10:00 P.M., we put her up on a trellis.  And, she climbed up and she darkened the skin of Joseph and Mary and Jesus, and kinked their hair, and we came on down.  The next day at worship, I was expecting really to catch a lot flak.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I, to this day, have never received a negative comment.
Speaker 2: I'm surprised of that.
Speaker 1: And, either the people didn't notice it because they was so used to the picture being there, or they were pleased with it, or they were kind enough not to make a point of it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Then in the stain glass windows, the builder of the church, now Bishop H.H. Brookins [Hamel Hartford Brookins], built it in 1968, had placed significate figures in the stain glass windows.  There was the founder of the church, Richard Allen.  There was Booker T. Washington, and there were others.  The one exception was that Jesus in the lead window down front was white.  So, was the years went by, and we were able to accumulate the money, we were able to get stained glass experts to go and make him African.  Someone who is not black would ask, what's so important about it?  Four centuries of deprivation, four centuries of being told that you have no history that is worthy was taking its toll on blacks.  So, that, even though we were caught up in the mist of the post dawning of the civil rights era, blacks were becoming consumers rather than producers.  Blacks were being to afflict each other, now having the freedom to indulge self-hatred that they had not had under strict apartheid or separation.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There was enough freedom to do good or to do bad.  Most did good, but for that core that wanted to do badly, they were free to hurt each other.  And, unless we began to see the glory in ourselves, we would be hurt.  So, the church with negative imaging tried to change the ethos of the times.
Story_ID: 309137
Speaker 1: Then we went into housing.  As of this day, we have some fourteen villages that were built over that quarter of a century.  Housing for seniors, housing for the physically handicapped, general public housing, housing for impoverished families and so for, with some two thousand tenants in them.  We next had to build up the males in the church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), Los Angeles, California] because males were imperiled.  Three percent of the American population, adult black males, three percent of the American population and 50 percent of the prison population, 80 percent going there because of substance abuse crimes.  So, we clearly needed treatment rather than imprisonment.  Plus, the Federal Judicial Council and the Sentencing Project, both out of Washington, D.C. said that for a white male to get the same sentence as a black male for the same crime of drugs, the white man had to use a hundred times as much power cocaine as the black man use crack cocaine.  And, the two are essentially the same.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Those two councils also said that for crimes, generally, black men got a 49 percent longer, higher sentencing than white men.
Story_ID: 308683
Speaker 1: Reverend Murray [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray] throughout your life you're known as a teacher, not only just a minister, but a very important teacher, especially in this community.  And, of course, during the riots, not the first riots but the first following--
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 1: King's death [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]; the assassination.  Tell us how you came to that position and why you wanted to make your church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), Los Angeles, California] such an important element.  We saw you every night on 'Nightline.'   And, for the first time some of the truth got out of what was really going on.  We saw the president of the United States--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --come over and so forth.  Tell us, how you came to that philosophy that you wanted the people, you wanted to educated, sensitize the people of Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2: I think when the civil unrest of 1992 broke out, we were in place to do whatever good was done.  Because we'd had fifteen years of steadily building, the machinery was there.  A Skid Row ministry, a men's ministry, a business development ministry, a housing ministry, a youth ministry, an AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] ministry because AIDS was decimating our people at the time.  We sent out kits to all of the black churches and some of them were utterly offended that those kits condamed--contained condoms.  And, we were saying, "Whatever happens abstinence is number one.  But, if you can't abstain it at least protect by using this condom."  Some of them sent them back.  One gentleman came from a prominent church and in the midst of our worship he stood up and said, he's a prophet and we're all going to hell for sending those--he call them condos, to the churches.  And, soon he, he went on out and we went on with, with church.  But, the ministries needed to be there.  Substance abuse ministry because in the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s] drugs infused our community.  At first it was the white community with powder cocaine but it was so expensive, we couldn't afford it.  And, then when it was watered down and made sellable, the white marketers sent it into the black communities and the drugs began killing our people and we began killing each other.  Then, in the '80s [1980s] and the '90s [1990s] weapons came into our community.  And, then in 2000s negative imaging; the DVDs and CDs where we were painting a poor picture of black people.  So, the black industry had to be there in the church.  We had to do something about the negative imaging.  We had to do something about the poverty of pocket so that we formulated FAME Renaissance, an economic development component.  That ultimately would let us go and hire 180 people in the church totality.  And, to have an inventory of about $60 million in properties and evaluations and a budget of about $13, $14, $15 million a year.
Story_ID: 308684
Speaker 1: So we were in place [in Los Angeles, California]. We had been meeting with the mayor [Tom Bradley] for about a week to two weeks before the blowup came.  We had been getting ready in the event the jury comes in with a negative verdict.  We would send twenty men to twenty different locales.  Your jobs is to keep the peace there.  You job is to keep the people under control.  Otherwise, this might be explosive.  The night we were in First AME [First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), Los Angeles, California] as a community meeting, the night of the verdict is the night we were ready to go out to the sites we had allotted.  We were all different denominations and all.  When we got the word that the city was on fire, and, walking out of the church quickly, you would look on the horizon and see it was like Dante's Inferno, fires were everywhere.  And, crowds were everywhere.  So, it was too late to implement that situation that we planned.  And, now we had to go into damage control.  I remember the men of the church coming together, it was some two hundred that were willing to go with us.  We went down to Adams Boulevard where there were about 150 young street fellows and they were intimidating the firemen who were there to put out the fires.  Included was the African American life insurance company right there on Adams--
Speaker 2: Golden State [Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company].
Speaker 1: And Western, Golden State.  And, their wall was burning.  And, we promised the firemen, if you would continue, we will protect you.  So, they formed a double line, those two hundred brothers and they bounced back and forth between the gangs, them, a line of police were behind us.  And, they, they really wanted to attack the crowds.  But, we said that would only inflate it, if we could.  So, we tried to keep them and the firemen working.  We went from 10:00 P.M. that night 'til about 2:00 P.M.--a--2:00 A.M. the next morning, and the fires were out, the gangs had dispersed and we were able to go.  Then it was a matter of going to those families that were burned out, bring them in to the plaza level of the church, feeding, clothing when necessary, housing temporarily until the Red Cross [American Red Cross] units came in.  And, they just about took everybody.  A couple of weeks later all were gone.  And, we were able then to go into emergency feeding, working with families in the communities for a couple of years.
Story_ID: 308685
Speaker 1: Did the federal government, the White House, and the local city government reach out to you and your congregation [at First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: They reached out, and we were able to receive help.  It was the private enterprise that was really the starling group to do it.  For instance, Michael Eisner who was president of Disney [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California] said to us, "Come, talk to our employees.  See if they will donate toward the rehabilitation work and the work of helping the evacuees.  Then whatever they give, we will double it," he said.  They gave five hundred thousand dollars.  Disney brought it up to a million dollars and that was the beginning of the business loan program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were able at first to do loans of two thousand dollars, fifty thousand dollars.  We realized as other companies fed in and we became a micro loan company.  It wasn't enough just to give a loan, you had to give business training.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, we developed a nine week course of business training.  Then you needed business mentoring.  Once you've done the training, give them the loan, then you need to hand hold them with people who are skilled in the business so they don't fail.  Or, else the failure rate would be so big, you would end up with none of the principal or the capital left.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, so, went on until we were ultimately able to make a loan for a million dollars, and loans for five hundred, four hundred thousand dollars and so forth and so on.  So, the private sector really rose to the occasion.  Ron Burkle who was with Food 4 Less [Compton, California], Boyd's Market and so forth and so on, who set up a feeding place for families that were displaced and without any means.  It was quite a bit east of the mainline, or the main center of L.A. [Los Angeles, California] but people were able to get out there.  Ron Burkle giving us food and supplies, and helping us, they were utterly amazing.  The stories that you could tell of people who came and stayed for a week are two works--weeks.  None black, whites were coming up from San Diego [California], from the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], groups coming in from New York [New York].  They came as they are doing with the case of Hurricane Katrina.  And, they really were a blessing and were able to enable us.  Government officials came, of course, with bureaucracy you would need six months to a year and so forth and so on--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to put in for long lasting programs.  And, the emergency procedure was not as impressive as it might be a little later, with FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] and so forth and so on.  But, those were years when you saw the best in people.  And, when the men of the church, the females, women of the church, the people of the community would come.  They would man the phone lines or they would help to feed or they would sweep the areas, they would help to keep the areas clean, they were stories of heroes and heroines.

Speaker 1: Well, you know, you have certainly been a national voice.  Not only here in Los Angeles [California] but of course a national voice all over the country for the past nine--well, most of your life but for the past twenty-seven years at FAME [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Los Angeles, California], you've been that voice.  And, you have since now retired from FAME and you've move over to USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about your duties over there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, what an experience.
Speaker 1: And, how you're continuing.
Speaker 2: And, to say USC is to say President Steve Sample [Steven Sample], who represents the presidents that come before him and the faculty and staff before him.  But, what a glorious man Steve Sample is.  USC surrounded by blacks and browns.  USC, something of a privileged center in an underprivileged environment.  Option to pick up and move.  Option to become insulated and build a fence around yourself.  Option to go out to the community and become a part of that community, and that community become a part of you.  They chose that one.  Presently some thirty-two thousand students, thousands of faculty, three thousand, six thousand part-time, full-time, 117 different nations.  It's like going into a new world.  I have known President Sample for the entirety of his presidency.  He has had me address his special class on leadership.  These are the gifted young men and woman who come and will be our leaders, our presidents and all for tomorrow.  They had presented me with an honorary doctorate degree.  Twenty o'two [2002] they had me to address their commencement ceremonies.  So, our church and the school, the community and the school, the community, the nation and USC have all been dialoguing with each other.  So, when I retired and was offered the opportunity to come on board as the Tansey Chair Christian Ethics [John R. Tansey Chair of Christian Ethics] senior fellow, senior research fellow at the Center for Religion [Center for Religion and Civic Culture], I was overwhelmed, and I'm so even 'til this very moment.  And, they are reaching out to the world, reinventing themselves, rediscovering ways of research, seeking to become in the top 1, 4, 5 percent of research universities in the world and achieving that goal.
Story_ID: 308687
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?  You've done a lot of work and obviously you're not finished.  But how would you, at this time, how would you like to be remembered?  By the many lives, people that you've touched and known over all these years?
Speaker 2: What a question.  You know even if we were moving at warped speed, it's too slow.  I think the best is yet to come.  I would like to be remembered as one who did his best, as one who was willing to reach to those who come in the next generation and pull, but certainly to stay out of their way, to enhance them by cooperating with them, following their leadership and seeing if we can go to the next level of achievement because the veteran generation did fairly, fairly well.  From segregation to desegregation, from poverty to the ninth richest economy in the world, black American but rich as consumers, now we must become rich as producers.  We must began to own the pond not just fish in it, or be given a fish.  Now, our children must be excited about education.  So, the legacy of my generation generally is to make certain that the open door doesn't get closed even by us or those who follow us.  And, a personal legacy is to make certain that I don't look at myself but look at the mission which God has given to us all.
Story_ID: 308688
Speaker 1: Now, I think I've covered everything.  But, can you think of anything I may have skipped over, or that I should be asking?  You've had a very rich life and I know it could be easy for me to miss something.
Speaker 2: Oh, in my life, shucks, you you're the first time, I've ever rehearsed the history of it.  I thank you so, so, so much St. Paul.
Speaker 1: We thank you very, very, very much.
Speaker 2: Shucks man--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: For you all to take this time.  The best is yet to come.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: If you're forty years and under now, like out gifted cameraman--
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: If you're forty years and under in thirty years, you'll live to be 120 years of age.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Because they've logged the human genes, hundreds of thousands and they're fix the things that kill us.  Our generation, well, seventy-seven is a pretty good medium.  At the turn of the century in 1900, they--the average age was forty-seven.  And, now 120, if we can get our young people to invest maybe twenty-five of those years for the other ninety-five.  And, if we can keep our people from becoming cynical.  If we can pull over to ourselves those non-blacks who would work with us if we are people of conscious and consciousness, American can be a great empire.  Otherwise, in 2030, 30 percent of Americans are blacks and browns.  In 2050, 50 percent of American are blacks and browns.  The white minority will be the white--the white majority now, will be the white minority then.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: So, if we can cohere and get out the best of each other, then my living has not been in vain.
Story_ID: 308689
Speaker 1: This is a continuation of the interview with the Reverend Cecil "Chip" Murray [HistoryMaker Reverend Cecil L. "Chip" Murray].  Reverend Murray, we did a lot in the interview last time, and there is one more question that I would like to get in.  And, this may be a multiple question, you may have more than one person.  But, my questions is, who are the theologians or ministers who most influenced you and the things that you've done through illustrious career?
Speaker 2: I think for my generation, we are all indebted to Howard Thurman, as a starter.  He was a preacher who was physical and metaphysical.  He was theological and practical.  He took us to the interspace and thus he was universalistic.  The white majority embraced him.  The black minority embraced him.  He wrote well.  He preached well.  He was an icon of excellence and coupled with the civil rights renaissance of the '60s [1960s], he gave respectability and responsibility to the black pulpit.  When we get to the era that was wrapped around his era, I think James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone] and those who were his peers helped to make the word become flesh.  He was an activist who yet was of an acute mind, who was theologically respectable and responsible.  That was the stage and age of Paul Tillich and Rudolf Bultmann and others who were prominent and he thought blacks would rate in their category.  And, could be even more so because his theology was relevant to the civil right renaissance and struggle in America.  And, the whole world was looking.  Therefore, the whole world was listening.  Later Malcolm X and others followed in that trail, and they had much to say.  But, for door openers, I think Howard Thurman and James Cone would be my generation's door openers.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you just to extend that question just a wee bit, can you remember to first time that you heard Howard Thurman speak?
Speaker 2: The first time I heard Howard Thurman speak was in Claremont [Southern California School of Theology; Claremont School of Theology, Claremont, California].  I was in my first year in seminary, 1961.  I'd just been released with ten years with the [U.S.] Air Force and I encountered his books.  I encountered those who mentioned him from the faculty being the first full-time black student at the School of Theology at Claremont, it was an overwhelming joy to see the esteem in which he was held and to examine his works.  And, to see that they weren't conciliatory, they were as they should have been standing up for truth, standing up for justice.  Perhaps during the internal examination rather than the civil rights struggle was doing, the external examination, he went inside and asked, "Can you live with this?"  And, then to procure his records and tapes gave me a better understanding of all.  So, it was in 1961 when I encountered him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, how about James Cone?
Speaker 2: James Cone was a hero to many and should be to most or to all.  He was a militant theologian who was militant for truth.  He was not militant for hatred not for anger.  But, he took the work of God and saw how life must adopt to the Word, rather than the Word adapt to life.  He said, "We must go to the Word and if we genuinely go to the Word, we will see that under the skin, all people are kin."  And, then he could justify his pro civility toward blacks by scriptures that would open up in a whole new way.  So, with his writings, a whole new trend started and black writers, writers of genius began to emerge for many quarters, particularly from the university campuses.  Our black professors began to explore, to research to write their books, because there was great denial of blacks to having access to our history.  And, these forerunners helped us to access where we were coming from so that we could see where we are and where we are going.
Story_ID: 308690
Speaker 1: And, if you would, Malcolm X--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A little bit different than most of the people that you've named here--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where--when was the first time you heard him or met him?
Speaker 2: The mid-'60s [1960s].  Malcolm was sent because he was in a period of transition to universal Islam as compared to Nation of Islam.  The Nation of Islam did meritorious work, a spin off from Islam, the Sunni Muslims and Shiites and so forth and so on.  And, when Malcolm takes the trip to the seat of Islam and returns with a rejuvenated agenda, with a rejuvenated mind then there were tensions between the old understanding of Martin--Malcolm and the new understanding.  The Nation was offended by the new Malcolm X, the Nation of Islam.  And, the American nation began to caress him as an option to the more fiery at least oratorical Nation of Islam.  He was militant but acceptable.  The Nation of Islam was militant.  And, at that phase and stage was non-acceptable.  Today, the mentality of the nation, both nations is different.  And, there is very little talk of hostility and anger and tension.  But, then there was talk of militancy as violence.  If it was reciprocal violence, there was talk of pulling aside a forming a separate black state in America.  There was not talk of merger but of separation, anger, hatred.  Then here comes the engineer who grew up with that philosophy but then says, "No, that is not the genuine approach of Islam which is a religion of peace, shalom and faith."  And, he began to seek ways other than the sore--sword.  So, I suspect Malcolm made the difference between sword force and soul force.  He paid, of course, with his life.  And, yet he will be enshrined beyond himself as one who took a path that ultimately led to other paths.  He was a way finder.
Story_ID: 308691
Speaker 1: Would it be fair to say that Howard Thurman and James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone], Paul Tillich and Malcolm X shaped your thinking for all of the forward looking things that you did in your church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), Los Angeles, California] there of--when you had the riots to combat there in your town?  The way you have stood up in your church like no other, in those years, in standing up for truth and some of say militancy, others would say just truth is enough, leading your congregation, would you say all of these are for, set your tone and your path?
Speaker 2: I would say, "Thank you for contributing to me.  Helping me to focus and helping me to structure a theology of truth as you have said, militant truth, truth worth living for, truth as with Jesus worth dying for, a Muhammad, a Moses, a Buda."  These gave validity to what I sensed on the inside.  There was another teacher, of course, of mine and that was my father, Edward W. Murray [Edward Murray, Sr.] of South Carolina, as was my natural mother [Janie Williams Murray], my stepmother [Minnie Saunders Murray] of Florida, but all of us from the Deep South and at a time of utter segregation to take a stand against the wrongness of segregation and discrimination.  And, to pass that to my brother [Edward Murray, Jr.], my sister [Louise Murray Bowman], and to me.  And, to let us see that we had an obligation beyond ourselves.  And, then to encounter his in print, and to see our history in print, and to see the gospel of our Lord in print, spelled out as inclusive of those who were denied doors and access to liberty.  All of this gave me a focus that said, I determine to give my life for my people, for my God, and that any church I pastor would be at the forefront of concern for liberty, equality, justice, spirituality.  So, these, my father, my teachers, our extended family and necessity helped me to pastor wherever I went.
Story_ID: 308692
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you, is there anything else that you wanted to include in this archival oral history?
Speaker 2: If I could look at yesterday and today with a view towards tomorrow, and if I could address America as a whole, I would be asking, since 1776, "Dear nation, aren't we getting a little old for this?"  And, the answer to people of conscious and consciousness would be, "Yes.  We are a nation of immigrants."  Someone has estimated that one out of five Americans presently is an immigrant.  And, we are struggling to see, in the words of Rodney King, "Can't we all just get along?"  Then, if I were to address a specific group, black Americans, I would say, "We've had two generations now since the civil rights revolution and in some ways we are worse off now than we were prior to the civil rights revolution."  Our youth are at risk.  Our families are at risk.  Our work ethic is at risk.  Our addiction to learning is at risk.  Because a Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] study says, 50 percent of blacks and browns will not finish high school.  And, without education our children have no foundation.  Our family structure, only 39 percent of blacks have a mother and a father in the home.  Our economics, though the nine riches economy in the world, we are consumers.  You and I discussed this before--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, we need to move to being producers rather than consumers.  In our religion, we have gotten skeptical and cynical.  In our leadership, it is difficult to define because many of us have gone materialistic looking out only for ourselves.  So, I would say to black America, we must awaken.  We must scrutinize where we are.  We have not arrived.  And, if we want to endure endlessly than we must transform our behavior and look inside, outside, around, and ahead.  And, then we'll be worthy of the trust.
