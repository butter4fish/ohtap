Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 1: Yes, I'd be most happy to.  First off, I'd like to welcome you to Long Beach and to thank you for being a part of your project.  My name is Richard Love, L-O-V-E... here in Long Beach, California.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Can you give us the date of your birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: Date of birth is June 24, 1938 in the city... county... country... a place of Hahira, Georgia.  That's spelled H-A-H-I-R-A.  It's about eighteen miles north of Valdosta, Georgia near the Florida/Georgia line.
Speaker 2: Can you spell Valdosta for us?
Speaker 1: V-A-L-D-O-S-T-A.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Georgia, yes.
Speaker 2: Alright.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 1: Presently, I am publisher of The Long Beach Times newspaper.
Speaker 2: And what is today's date?
Speaker 1: Today is the 19th of November, in the great year 2002.
Speaker 2: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 1: We're now sitting in the conference room of The Long Beach Times newspaper at 121 Linden Avenue, Long Beach, California.
Story_ID: 74402
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we get into depth, there are five People Magazinish-type questions that I'm compelled to ask you.
Speaker 2: Terrific.
Speaker 1: The first one--and they just require a short answer.  And the first question is, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, believe it or not, is fish--boiled, baked or fried.  And it would be red snapper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Color would be brown and black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year is every day that I'm up breathing, and able to hopefully reach an objective for that day.
Speaker 1: That makes sense.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation destination would be St. Petersburg, Florida.  Why?  Because that's where the home state is.  My mother [Ophelia Love] lives there, and most of my relatives are within a two or three hour drive from St. Petersburg, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Sir, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite phrase from a black perspective--from an entrepreneurial point of view is "We can't do it without you."
Story_ID: 74403
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let's talk about your family history.  Do you have any knowledge of what your family was doing in the distant past, or any knowledge about the origin of your family?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  I'm the product of Roosevelt and Ophelia Love.  My mother--
Speaker 1: Can you spell their names?
Speaker 2: O-P-H-E-L-I-A, Ophelia.  And of course Roosevelt is like the President of the country, R-O-O-S-E-V-E-L-T, Roosevelt Love.  Both are from also the area of Hahira, Georgia.  By that I mean I'm from the old school.  And we were from a country setting--not that a lot of people are aware of what I'm speaking of--but the closest store was eighteen miles away from the farmland where we grew up at.
Story_ID: 74404
Speaker 1: Other than that, my grandmother, Lela Hall, bless her soul, died about the year 1961 in Hahira, Georgia.  And she was the daughter of a slave, coming from a family in that area who she worked for.  Other than that, I've never known any of my grandfathers. However, through research I've been aware that my father's father started a church in Savannah, Georgia that the family has researched.  And there has only been about three or four pastors since his starting that church.  And they also, my grandfather, used to hide slaves in the church basement in Savannah, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, what denomination is the church?  Do you know the denomination?
Speaker 1: I believe it's a Methodist church.  I don't know the full naming of the church, but I do know that it was, it's the oldest church in Savannah, Georgia.
Speaker 2: So, your, would this be your great-grandfather?
Speaker 1: My grandfather, my father's father.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you said that they would hide slaves in there?
Speaker 1: Yes.  That goes back--because even though he started the church, he had begun--and this was a very old gentleman, which meant what we're talking about is when fathers still sired children at a very late age in their life.  And I think my father was born when his father was about sixty-eight or seventy years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought it.  Because I thought that maybe...   Yeah, at the time, yeah.  He would have to be very old to--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to remember slavery.
Speaker 1: And of course, black men had to have kids to work the farms.  And that's why as I was speaking to you before--my father's [Roosevelt Love] one of 49 brothers and sisters in that area, because they needed the kids to work the farms.  This was from one man and three women.  And the closest other wife was about maybe twelve or fourteen miles in the country area that this happened in.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, wait.  You're saying that your--is this is the grandfather that was a minister?
Speaker 1: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: He had three--
Speaker 1: Three different women who he had children from.
Speaker 2: And the total is forty-nine?
Speaker 1: Fort-nine, that's correct.
Speaker 2: That's remarkable.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Anybody whose name is Love, Register, Roundtree, Walker, or Reed who come from the Valdosta or either the Savannah area, chances are they're in the Love family.
Speaker 2: Okay, a big family to keep track of.
Speaker 1: It quite is.
Speaker 2: Very.
Speaker 1: Of course, our family reunions now started about ten years ago, and the average attendance is like 450 people.  So, we're growing, and we're finding our relatives near and far.
Speaker 2: So this, this, your grandfather then was--he was free?  He wasn't a slave during slave days?
Speaker 1: He was right after the--he was a freed child, I'll put it that way.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Of a slave.
Speaker 2: Alright.  And so he, he was able to assist people in escaping from slavery?
Speaker 1: That's correct.
Speaker 2: In the church?
Speaker 1: That's correct, the basement.  Because I understand that the basement had tunnels that went from the church's basement to near the ocean there in Savannah, so that they could escape.
Story_ID: 74405
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story.  Any stories from your mother's [Ophelia Love] side of the family?
Speaker 2: My mother's side was more what we would call the house Negro or house nigger category.  They were waitresses, and waited on the family of the white man's home.  My grandmother was very... an excellent person.  And I think of some the stories--not only stories--but things I've seen her do before her passing.  And there is a statue of Lela Hall to this day at the city block there in Hahira, Georgia proclaiming--
Speaker 1: Of your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, of my grandmother proclaiming her to be the first educator of Hahira, Georgia.
Story_ID: 74406
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, is Hahira [Georgia] like a black town?
Speaker 2: No, it's not, but it's the town that you don't see depicted in movies or anything of that nature.  Hahira is a town where everybody helped everybody.  There was no backdoor mentality, because the white man knew that we needed--that they needed blacks in order to help them go from year to year, from harvest to harvest, as well as whites came over to the black farms to help harvest their field as well.  So, it was not something that America is quite aware of--that there was, you know, the backdoor mentality.  For example, my mother [Ophelia Love], to this day, who is eighty-eight, still goes back to Hahira, Georgia to receive dental services from the nephew of the person who my grandmother serviced in their home.  She knows that she doesn't have to, but that's just the tradition.  She knows that she has a loyalty to that family.  And call that a mindset if you will, but as long as she's happy and comfortable with receiving that kind of dental treatment, I'm happy for her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So relationships, lasting relationships came out of that experience?
Speaker 2: The need for both and white to help each other to maintain and survive.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  What was the name of that family, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, that skips my mind.  I just know that as a child growing up, three or four years old, they provided the great ice cream and the candy pops for black kids.
Story_ID: 74407
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, tell us about your father.  His name was Roosevelt Love.
Speaker 2: Roosevelt Love, Roosevelt Alexander Love.
Speaker 1: And what did he do for a living?  And what kind of a person was he?
Speaker 2: My father was a very great person.  To me, he was my number one role model.  He was a big, burly, strappling 250 pounds or so individual, and he was focused on the things he did.  For example, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps.  And as I remember him going to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, because of his articulation and his focus in being the best that he could be, he became the, what you call NCOIC.  Now, I think that stands for Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge.  But during that period of time, it was known as the HNIC, which was the "head nigger in charge."  And he was in charge of the all black residences.  He was in charge of all the PX's [post exchanges].  And of course it was separate, supposedly equal facilities.  So, he was the big stick so far as being the black--big black person in charge of Camp Lejeune Marine Corps base.
Speaker 1: Now, he joined the service during World War II?
Speaker 2: Just, just, just after World... no, just before World War II, even though he didn't see action.  Because of his skills and expertise, he remained state-side, as he was an administrative person in charge of other blacks at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you say he was born?
Speaker 2: I don't know when my father was born, the specific date.  But he was born in the year 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so was my mother [Ophelia Love].
Story_ID: 74408
Speaker 1: Now what... was it a... was it a normal thing for a black person to be in the Marine Corps in those days?
Speaker 2: Being such a young child, you know, you just accept things.  We weren't aware of any, you know, great social issues at the time.  I just knew that my father [Roosevelt Love] was the person in charge.  Black and white asked him about, you know, what to do, how to do it... to make things happen.
Speaker 1: He stayed in the service a long time?
Speaker 2: No, he was only in for four years.  And when he was discharged, my father moved the family to St. Petersburg, Florida.
Speaker 1: Now, was the war still going on when he was discharged?  I mean--
Speaker 2: No, no, this was after--
Speaker 1: You said he joined before the war then (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That's correct.  He joined while the war was going on.  And after--
Speaker 1: He joined while the war--
Speaker 2: While the war was going on.  And he spent four years there as a state-side enlisted person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And after he was discharged, he moved to--his family to St. Petersburg, Florida.  And coming into St. Petersburg, Florida he then became the first black letter carrier, a U.S. postman, in St. Petersburg, Florida.  And I don't remember the exact designation.  But one, he could have been just a letter carrier or either a postman delivering to black residents only.  Or, he could have been a federal employee where he delivered to everyone.  My father chose to be a federal employee, thereby delivering the U.S. mail to anybody.  And of course, we were not aware of some of the things that happened to him until his death--that whites and blacks came to let us know that on his first day of his work as a postman, the KKK [Ku Klux Klan] blocked his route because they did not want a black man delivering their mail.  Of course, at that time, they didn't want a "nigger" delivering their mail.  There were animal feces and all kinds of things in the mailboxes when he stuck his hand in to retrieve the mail once the red flag was up.  But he never complained, he just did his job.  And because of that, he was recognized as the person in the community who was making, I guess, strides, because he was standing on someone else's shoulders.  And as a result of that, he held positions as president of the Amvets.  He held positions as chairman of the quote "bi-racial committee" at that time to help with integration and black and white issues.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was involved in the Civil Rights Movement in--
Speaker 2: In St. Petersburg, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 74409
Speaker 1: Now, what about your mother [Ophelia Love]?  She was born in 1915 as well.
Speaker 2: Right, she was born in April of 1915.  She attended, what is it?  Valley State?  No, what is it--Savannah State College [Savannah, Georgia] for about two years, because her sister had also attended college.  And her sister was a principal in Hahira, Georgia, the first black principal for a school that black and white kids attended.  And my mother also taught school for a short period of time while my father was in the Marine Corps, and then moved to St. Petersburg, Florida.
Speaker 1: Now, you said that her mother was Lela Hall?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's mother was Lela.
Speaker 1: She was the first black educator in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Now, the first black educator--by that, it is not quote "what you call today"--someone has a PhD or that kind of thing.  But she educated all children, black and white, about social graces--how to read and how to write.  Because if you can relate, most of the kids were either in the field all day.  And during the lunch hour or whenever we were able to rest, my grandmother would teach all kids--whether they were black or white kids--their alphabets, social graces... "Yes ma'am," "No ma'am," how to curtsy, and how to read and write and do arithmetic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, your mother is following in the footsteps of her mother?
Speaker 2: Yes, initially.  And of course, once we moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, my mother did not work until my brother and I were out of high school.  And when she did work, she became the supervisor of the school lunch program in St. Petersburg, Florida until she retired.
Story_ID: 74410
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, do your mother [Ophelia Love] and father [Roosevelt Love] have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: No, I've never, I never heard that.  You know, I've never heard it.  But I can imagine just looking back on history in the area where they were, they either met at church, they met in the fields, or they met one Saturday maybe going to a nickel movie.  But I will ask my mother that.  That's a good question, I would like to know also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, do you know about what time they married, I mean what stage of life they got married?
Speaker 1: My mother was about maybe twenty-one, because they were both the same age.  I think my mother was about six months older than my father.  So, I don't know specifically if that was the age.  But I think back through my age and my brother's age and their age.  So, it was round about twenty-one when they got married.
Story_ID: 74411
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, you were born in--
Speaker 2: Hahira, Georgia.
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: June 24, 1938.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you grew up in Hahira and in St. Petersburg [Florida], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, mostly in St. Petersburg.  And what happened is each summer my parents would--and the parents of other relatives--would bring their kids back to Hahira, back to help the old folks do their summer harvesting--picking cotton, cropping tobacco, loading watermelons, and whatever needed to be done; the curing of tobacco, staying up all night at the tobacco barn; having lovable but friendly fights with cousins from Detroit [Michigan] or St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 1: They would all come back?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they would all come back.  And you know, you just came back, and there were fifteen or twenty, you know, cousins all at your, you know, grandmother's house.  And there was never any... any concern about, you know, eating or sleeping; we were just there.  We were happy to be there, because everybody worked and everybody had a chore to do.
Story_ID: 74412
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you just think back and give us some kind of an idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In Hahira?  Yes.  As maybe as unpleasant as some of them may sound--but the sounds and smells of my youth were the rolling of the wagon wheels on the clay road.  Whether the clay road was a hot summer hard-cracked road or whether it was a slippery wet clay road, the hoof sounds of the Clinestein (ph.)--is that the name of the horse?  The horses that pull the Budweiser beer.
Speaker 1: Clydesdale.
Speaker 2: Clydesdale, there you go--horses plugging along.  The security of having these horses pull you in a sled or wagon without having to have a driver, because the horse knew exactly where to go.  The pots and pans sounds that your grandmother were preparing a breakfast, you know, early morning before you went to the field.  The sounds of a syrup bucket that you carried to school with a big rock biscuit in it, and the syrup did not get in the way of the biscuit until lunchtime.  The sound of Maltese and big Mack trucks, you know, going down the highway twenty miles away--that you could tell either the time of the day, because the Greyhound Bus traveled along U.S. 41 at a certain time.  You could tell who was going to see who late at night on a Saturday or Sunday night, because of either the horse hoofs or how the wagon squeaked, even if there were... who had the John Deere tractor.  And we knew that whoever had the John Deere tractor, which was white-owned at that time, was the white boy going to see whoever, because of the sound of the motor.  We could tell whose truck was being started up late at night, and the sound just vibrated throughout the fields.  Is that it was John Boy going to see Mary Ellen, and that kind of thing.  So, these are the sounds that I remember as a child growing up in the country of Hahira, Georgia, and the smells of, you know, hog killing days and tobacco selling at the warehouses, which...no more.
Story_ID: 74413
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, what kind of a little boy were you?  What were you thinking about when you were being raised in Hahira [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  I was really thinking about following my brother [Jim Love].  He was the more--even though he's only fourteen months older than I am, he sought of had a sense and an air about what to do and when to do, and how not to be caught.  And I still admire my brother today.  He's a very successful businessperson in Denver, Colorado.  And I still seek his advice on matters that pertain to my business, and also some personal matters that I may have questions on; I value his wisdom and his knowledge.  Other than that, he was just the--when I was coming up, I just had to be with my brother.  Wherever he went, I was there.
Story_ID: 74414
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what did you like to do?  I mean what things did he [Jim Love] do that you followed him around to do?  And what things did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, there... you know, when you're coming up--six, seven, eight, years old, you're living in the city of St. Petersburg [Florida] and you're going to the country in the summertime... you would like to just climb the fig trees.  You like to go out in the field when the day was over and to just punch a watermelon with your fist, and you'd grab the heart of the watermelon out... you would throw it at each other.  You would play marbles.  And you would wait for that Saturday when you could get away from the fields and dress up.  And using maybe the... there were no bathtubs per se, but we all went down to the creek, and that was the cooling water coming from out of the mountain, where we bathed.  Women bathed first and men bathed second.  Getting on your sneakers and jeans--and at that time they were just overalls--and going into a movie into town.  Riding on the back of a truck or on the back of a wagon, and waving at everybody as they pass you by.  Going to see a Johnny Mack Brown movie or a Roy Rogers movie, and that kind of thing.  So, these are the happy moments of a, you know, six, seven, eight year old kid growing up in the country with everybody else.  And at that time if you did something that was not appropriate, you didn't have to wait for an adult to correct you--a cousin who was maybe five or six years older, could easily make you do right.  And if an adult was needed, it didn't matter whether it was your mother or your father, it was just an adult that you had respect for.  And you just, you know, straightened up real quick.
Story_ID: 74415
Speaker 1: Alright.  Well, tell me about school.  What school did you go to, and when did you start school?  And--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Did you like it?
Speaker 2: Yes, I loved school.  I enjoyed the interactions that, you know, took place straight through from elementary right up to high school.  I was very active in running, you know, the movie projectors.  When we needed that, I would volunteer in the library.  As a matter of fact when I graduated from high school, I was offered a scholarship to become a librarian.  But now, you got to realize that's back in the fifties [1950s].  I graduated in 1957.  And at that time, librarians in the quote "black culture" was not a manly position.  However, librarians today, (Laughter) you know, the money speaks for itself.  But at that time--and not having the kind of counseling and the kind of things that we have today, I just couldn't see myself going to a school to become quote "a librarian."  That was more of a sissy kind of a job.
Story_ID: 74416
Speaker 1: So, but getting back to school--it was enjoyable.  I played sports: football and basketball.  As a matter of fact when--I was so good at baseball that I was playing varsity ball from ninth grade.  And when the Dodgers farm team came to St. Petersburg [Florida], as they did each year to select one person, there was a fellow named Nathaniel Oliver and myself.  We were just great baseball players, and they could only take one.  And there were my parents--my mother [Ophelia Love], really.  And my father [Roosevelt Love] was elsewhere... and his parents.  And this representative from the Dodgers farm team was saying, "We can only take one.  So, how are we going to decide?  And someone said, "Let's flip a coin."  A coin was flipped, and guess who won the flip?  Yours truly.  But my mother said, "Oh, let the Oliver kid go, because he comes from a sports family."  And that was one of the most traumatic experiences in my young life.  And he went to the Dodgers farm team, and eventually became a great baseball player.  And, but, the toss of a coin and following my mother's suggestion was a real downer for me.  But--
Speaker 2: How old were you then?
Speaker 1: That was... what, seventeen and a half, eighteen when I finished high school.
Story_ID: 74417
Speaker 1: But then, you know, that was one of the things.  And then in ninth grade I was going to school, and at that time you could take a test where if you pass, you could go straight to college.  And of course, I was one of the top scorers on the test.  And my mother [Ophelia Love] decided that she did not want me to go straight from ninth grade to college.  She wanted me to grow up in a more balanced way.  She didn't want me to lose any of my tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade living that I had to do, you know, as a student.  All the other students went straight to college.  And I can see now, my mother had great wisdom.  Even though we are still friends, a lot of those students who went directly from ninth grade to college has had some adverse psychological problems--not being able to really socialize.  They were good as long as they stayed in their area of concentration.  But there's one friend of mine, she's a great attorney today.  She represents some of the great clients of this country, like Bill Cosby, Wesley Snipes and others.  But she still is not what you call... can go out sociably and enjoy herself.
Story_ID: 74418
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, your mother [Ophelia Love] kept you out of the Dodgers because she felt that you--once again, what was the reason for that?
Speaker 2: Because Nathaniel Oliver had grown up in a--
Speaker 1: Sports family?
Speaker 2: Sports family.  And I was the only person to play sports.  My brother was not a sportsman, he was more of a bandsman--jazz man, academia person who really is a veterinarian by training and accomplishments, but is a successful businessperson in Denver, Colorado.  And of course, the other reason that my mother gave is that--by not going to college from ninth grade--was that she wanted to me make a balanced individual by having me just take the normal acclimations of going from grade to grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which I haven't regretted it at all.
Story_ID: 74756
Speaker 1: I just want to--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about high school--well grade school--go back to grade school--and then high school, and ask you about what teachers or other adults in the community served as a role model for you maybe and/or took an interest in your growth and development.
Speaker 2: Well, starting back at second grade, there was a Mrs. Whittier, Whittier.  Mrs. Whittier was a... about a 300-pound lady.  And I was in second grade, and at that time teachers taught everything, you know, and you didn't go, you know, from one class to the other.  She said, "Love, if you don't know how much eight and five is tomorrow, I'm going to send you back to first grade."  And of course, you know, I didn't know what was eight and five.  And she, the next day when I went to school, she asked me.  I gave an incorrect answer, and she told me to come forward and bring my books. And she wrote a note in my book and said, "Take this to Mrs. Jones," which was the first grade teacher.  And I took it to Mrs. Jones.  And I got ready to leave, and Mrs. Jones said, "Richard, find a seat."  And that was the time where teachers were almost next to God.  And as a result, I stayed in first grade (Laughter) two years.  But to this day up until--she's passed now--she was a very reverent person in my life.  Because as I progressed to second... back to second, third, fourth, and fifth and sixth, I could always go back to Miss Whittier and ask her questions or anything that I may have wanted to challenge from her.  Then getting into junior high school, there was a teacher by the name of Mr. Campbell; he came from a great family.  His brothers, they went to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], they all graduated from Fisk University.  He was our coach, and among math students and that kind of thing.  But he was one who took an interest not just from a grade point of view, but how to be a gentleman, how to be a young man, how to do things that normally, you know, no one would have an interest in.  He would take us aside and counsel us if he saw something that was amiss.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Campbell was our 45th high school class reunion keynote speaker this past June in St. Petersburg, Florida.  So, these are some of the key teachers and people in my life coming through school who really had a great impact on me today.
Story_ID: 74757
Speaker 1: So, in high school, did you have an idea of what you wanted to be when you grew up, occupationally?
Speaker 2: In high school, all I wanted to do was get out of high school and go to New York City [New York].  (Laughter).  I had no aspirations at that time, you know, talking about going to college or that kind of thing.  I figured my brother was in college, and that was enough for one family.  And I remember when my brother came home for summer.  And as he was getting ready to go back, I wasn't, you know, had any interest in going.  My father [Roosevelt Love] and my brother had packed some clothing and put it in the trunk of my brother's car, which I was unaware of.  And my brother asked me if I wanted to ride with him up to the block, which means--you know, in that time, everybody... every city has a block.  And I said sure.  And we had washed his car, and I was riding with my big brother.  And instead of him stopping at the block, he hit the highway.  And when I found out what was going on, I pleaded with him to stop the car and let me out.  And he said, "Quite frankly, if you want to get out, just open the door and get out."  But he never slowed down, he was going 55 or 60 miles an hour.  And that was fast at that time.  So, by the time I fussed and cried and kicked and whatever, we were 50, 60 miles away.  And I calmed down, and the next thing I know, in the next day and a half--because it took the drive from St. Petersburg, Florida to Frankfurt, Kentucky... I was enrolling at Kentucky State College [Frankfort, Kentucky].
Speaker 1: So, they just sprung it on you?
Speaker 2: They sprung it on me, they sprung it on me.
Speaker 1: They had no discussion about it at all?
Speaker 2: No discussion.  (Laughter).  They knew I was not, you know, wanting to go to college.  And this is how I got into Kentucky; I never applied to Kentucky State College.  My brother was an upperclassman, classmate, and when I arrived they put me in an upperclassman dorm and I just went on from there.  And of course, that was '57 [1957], '58 [1958].
Story_ID: 74758
Speaker 1: And the reason I left Kentucky State [College, Frankfort, Kentucky] was that this our school, it was a black school.  See, they started letting white students in.  And a group of us decided we weren't going to take this.  So, we burned the damn gym down.  And--
Speaker 2: Now this was, what year was this?
Speaker 1: Fifty-Seven [1957], '58 [1958].  And we burned the gym down.  And the next thing, I was in the service.  And, but no--
Speaker 2: Did you, did they--
Speaker 1: Nobody came after us.  Black teachers and professors and black college presidents at that time understood how to--they had a vision.  They knew what was coming down, and that kind of thing.  And I don't know how many of it was--you know, you get caught up in the wrath.  And I joined the military for three years, and had a wonderful military career.  And very seldom do we even ever think of it, but that was I guess the most radical time in my life, in doing that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's go back to that for a second.  But, you know, how did...  Now, you're at Kentucky State?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And how did things start off for you?  Did they start off alright?
Speaker 1: Oh, great, great.
Speaker 2: Did you like your classes?
Speaker 1: Oh, loved the classes.  Like I said, I was in an upperclassman dormitory.  And I didn't know it.  My brother was a big Kappa [member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] man on campus, and I didn't understand, you know, what was going on.  Maybe there was some perks that I was receiving that other freshmen were not.  I could eat in certain parts of the cafeteria where other freshman, you know, would not, could not eat.  And I didn't have to go--you know, what they do with freshmen at that time--you know, kind of do some de-humanizing things to thing.  But I was the, the little brother of Jim Love.  And he left my first year.  He finished and went to veterinarian school at Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama].  So, I had sort of a clear path, you know, mapped out for me.
Story_ID: 74759
Speaker 1: But then when he left, they started letting white students into the college [Kentucky State College, Frankfort, Kentucky].  And--
Speaker 2: How did that come up as an issue?  Did they announce they were going to do that?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Was this your second year they did that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Or your third year?
Speaker 1: It was the end of my first year, end of my first year.  And I remember it was either Carl Rowan or Whitney Young--somebody had come to the campus and was making a speech about something.  But it was about unity and being able to use our own resources, and we could do what we wanted to do, you know, in reference to education and moving forward.  And it was the time of, you know, "I'm black and I'm proud."  It was a time of, when Adam Clayton Powell was, you know, into you know... high profile.  And it was the time--
Speaker 2: Now, you're talking about 1958?
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958].  Fifty-four [1954]; it was just after the Roe--
Speaker 2: Right after the (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, we were like getting into supposedly the thick of things.  We were wanting to grab hold of the same things that white America had.  We were under the illusion that the field was a level playing field, and a whole lot of things that we were quite illusionary about.  And, but we wanted to keep our school black.  We wanted to keep our football team black, and that kind of thing.  And of course, there were some of us--and maybe I was one of them--who felt that, you know, the white student was maybe just a symbol that we were looking at of oppression in other areas, and that when they came, "Hey, you're already got a school, you know, why come to ours?"  And I don't know if it was a basketball player who had come.  For whatever reason, we decided to disrupt it by burning the gym down.
Speaker 2: Did you have an organization that you all formed?
Speaker 1: No, it was just like, like I say, it was--you know, how students just get together and one thing leads to the other.  There was no organization or anything like that.  It's just that--college students... the same college students today.  You sit around and some could afford beer, and that kind of thing.  And we were just college students, and we did those things.
Speaker 2: Did you have a plan?  Or did you--
Speaker 1: No, there was no plan.
Speaker 2: --consult the university?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, there was no plan.
Speaker 2: "If you do this, we'll burn the gym."
Speaker 1: Oh, no.
Speaker 2: Or, "Something else will come down next if you..."
Speaker 1: No, it was just--
Speaker 2: No dialog.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just some undisciplined college students, black males, sitting around--maybe females, too--rapping.  And as a freshman I'm listening to these upperclassmen and that kind of thing.  And you're wanting to be a part of it, and you're going to follow this group and you're just there, you're on the tail-end.  And it wasn't that... you know, I wasn't one to strike a match, it was just that I was there.  I maybe took a board and threw on it or something.  But, you know, that was... that was one of the reasons why I went and joined the [U.S.] Army.
Story_ID: 74760
Speaker 1: So, you just, you dropped out of school?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Before you went into the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and went to the military for--
Speaker 1: This is about 1950--
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958], September of '58 [1958].  Yeah, because I joined the service in September of '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: That's before the Vietnam War?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Even though I was in for three years, I missed the Vietnam and of course the Korean War.  However, when I was rotating back to the States from Germany is was when they were putting up the Berlin Wall, and that was in September of '61 [1961].  And there were, oh, about ten thousand troops on this ship.  And I would imagine about half of them got off the ship when the announcement came, if they wanted to stay in Germany to deal with the Berlin Wall crises.  And of course, me, I had served my time.  I would have wanted to stay in Germany had I been able to be discharged in Germany.  But then, there again, being black, you know, was not the thing for the American government to say, "We're going to discharge this black..." but they were letting white troops, you know, be discharged in Germany.  And it's always... like America's always been an unequal, you know, un-level playing field for people of color.
Story_ID: 74761
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, now what occupations did you, I mean what things did you pursue in the service?  And what job did you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, in the service, I really enjoyed the service.  You got to remember during that time, we were quite conscious of a certain thing that society was doing, and certain things that the American government was doing.  So, therefore when I signed up for the military, I never put down that I was black.  And you had to take tests to see where your, where you would score.  And because my score was very good in a lot of areas, I was selected to go the Army Security Agency training facility in Fort Devens, Massachusetts.  And I remember leaving Boston with about maybe twenty-five other white soldiers.  And when we arrived at Fort Devens, I think about the picture of Cuba Gooding who played in the movie about the deep sea diver.  When we all fell off the bus, the white sergeant came up and called everybody's name.  And when he got to my name, he said, "Private Love, stand over here."  And it took about--I stood there for about seven hours after they loaded the bus and went into the camp.  And I remember Colonel Lumea, I never will forget his name.  He came, going into the base, and he stopped his Jeep and came over.  And I saluted him of course; he wanted to know what I was doing standing there.  And I told him my orders said that I was supposed to come to Fort Devens ASA [Army Security Agency], and that the white troops had already been taken into the camp about four to five hours ago, and the sergeant just, you know, told me to stand here and I'm just following orders.  And he commanded me to get in his Jeep, and that's how I got on the post and got admitted to the school at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.  So, a lot of these things you see in movies, there are still some of us who have lived those exact incidents.
Story_ID: 74762
Speaker 1: And of course when I went to the school at the Army Security Agency, out of about three or four hundred students, I was the number one student graduating, and had the option of deciding, you know, where I wanted to serve--you know, Tokyo, Germany, wherever.  And I chose Germany, the Bavarian Alps, which is southern Germany, to do my enlistment in the military.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  And what were the Alps like?
Speaker 1: Oh, beautiful, beautiful.  Green most of the year-round.  I participated in some of the civic activities there. There was a German National there named Oohly (ph.) Shell and his wife Marianne, who I met just on the street one day.  And not really understanding a lot of the things about the German culture--which they taught me--Oohly's father was the Burgermeister, which was like the mayor of the town.  And I was just on my regular southern, you know, courtesies, and I was invited into their home.  And I never ate another meal on the post since I met Marianne and Oohly Shell.  And I became a member of the... the name of the city was Schwabisch Gmund, and I became a member of their fencing team.  And I went to their small fencing Olympics, and I won second place as the fencing championship of the city of Schwabisch.
Speaker 2: Where did you learn to fence?
Speaker 1: I learned to fence from Oohly and Marianne.  They were, had a fencing team.  And like most things, you know, we, at least I am, sort of a natural athlete.  And I enjoyed it; I still do it sometimes now to keep my weight down.  Besides swimming, fencing is one of the great sports to really keep a balanced physique.  So, that's how I learned fencing, from Oohly and Marianne Shell.
Story_ID: 74763
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, are there any other--did you do any writing in the--
Speaker 2: No, not writing in the sense that... you mean like, you know, what we do now.  I was the battalion photographer attached to a houser outfit in Germany, which meant that wherever the colonel went--who was the commanding officer--I was there to take pictures and to profile him in the best of light when he met, you know, dignitaries coming to the post or when he met people from the States--senators and that kind of thing.  I was to record, you know, the events, which I enjoyed very much because I didn't have to fall out for Reveille.  I had a, you know, a dark room in the basement of the command headquarters and I could come and go at will.  So I enjoyed it.  But after, you know, three years of doing that, you know, I came back to the States.
Story_ID: 74764
Speaker 1: And insofar as newspaper is concerned, the only other maybe experience that I've had was doing a community newsletter in Dade County, Florida for a local home ownership area.  But how I really got into the newspaper... I'm not a quote "journalist" by training.  I was coming here in '85' [1985] working for the government.  And I was, my office was in Westwood, and I lived in Long Beach [California].  And each evening, I would come back.  And especially weekends I would go around Long Beach and I would, say, look for something black in journalism from a black perspective.  And there was not a black newspaper.  I saw a Hispanic newspaper, La Opinion.  I saw the white newspaper, The Press Telegram, and I'd see a Filipino newspaper.  So we did a sort of windshield survey, a feasibility study if you will, to see whether or not there was support for a black newspaper in Long Beach--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: And of course, they--
Speaker 2: I don't want to get too far ahead.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Now, we generally reserve this to '85 [1985]--
Speaker 1: (Laughter), Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I don't want to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's good to get the details on all the papers--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, let me stay with your rhythm, okay.
Story_ID: 74765
Speaker 1: But, you know, yeah, let's go back and see what happened when you got out of the service.
Speaker 2: Oh, when I got out of the service?  I got out of the service in September of '61 [1961].  Came back to St. Petersburg, Florida.  As a matter of fact, I got married in '58 [1958], yeah, around Christmastime in '58 [1958] and then went back into the service.  But when I got out of the service, came back to St. Petersburg, I was able to get my old job back.  I was an orderly at Mercy Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida where you... you know, you take care of the floors, sweep the floors, mop them, wax them.  You help the doctors and the nurses turn patients, you know, bathe them.  And whatever needed was what I was doing.  And then I know my father [Roosevelt Love] asked me, "How would you like to work for the government?"  So I got back in September, maybe October or November.  After I was working back at Mercy Hospital, my father asked me that question.  I said, "Sure."  And he said, "Well, the VA is going to be hiring next week," or whenever.  And my father always a plan, but I, you know, like any maybe twenty-on-year-old person at that time, I really wasn't in tune with the social issues.  And my father being chairman of the bi-racial committee and some other things, knew that they were going to hire some blacks at the VA Hospital, because they had been picketing there because no blacks were hired at the VA [Veterans Affairs] Hospital.  And so, I went to take the test.  And when I took the test, at that time, you had about a thousand people in this room at Don CeSar Hospital there.  And they told us to wait.  And then someone came out and said, "The following names, please remain."  And all the names called was George Brogan, Richard Love, somebody named Johnson, a couple of other people... were all black.  And when we think about it now, we didn't know what was going on then.  But when we think about it now, it was a set-up.  They had already identified who they were going to hire.  They were going to hire sons and daughters of good blacks who held some kind of positions in the community.  I didn't care, I just wanted a job.  And if I remember, at that time we started as an orderly, it was something like, oh, maybe thirty-eight hundred dollars a year, which was a hell of a lot of money at that time.  But everything is relative.  Then from there, being black and being proud and being the son of somebody, there were other agencies who looked around and said, "Hey, maybe we can steal him."  And not only me, but the other blacks were stolen for different federal agencies to make that agency look good.
Story_ID: 74766
Speaker 1: And the, one of the agencies that I worked for was the Department of the Interior.  And they stole me from the VA and then I went to another agency. Then before the Secret Service became the way it is today... when the vice-president, Hubert Humphrey came to Florida, I was designated or commanded--or whatever you want to call it--by the U.S. Department of Defense to be part of his protective crew.  And there again, was it a ploy to just have a black to say that, you know, I was on the staff for whatever?  So, I gave him service every time he came into Florida while I was working for the Department of the Interior.  After that... that was in Miami, Florida.  I began to--
Speaker 2: --Well what was he like?
Speaker 1: Oh, he was a very, he was a politician.  The only contact I really had was maybe saying, "Hello," "How are you?"  And when there was cameras rolling or something, he would make some gesture to say something to me to get, you know, what you call a byte or something, to show that he had communication with one of his black agents.  At that time, I was just--hey, I was just carrying... packing a .38 or a .45, and had the earplug in the ear.  And I was, as I look back, I was the spook that sat by the door, (Laughter) so to speak.  But it was part of an era where you're still focusing and getting your thoughts about you.  And I was glad to be of service to Vice-President Humphrey at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is about 19--
Speaker 1: That was from '62 [1962], '63 [1963] and maybe '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964], okay.  Because he stayed Vice President I think until '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: I really wouldn't know.  At that time, it didn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was Vice President until sixty...?  Yeah, he was Vice President for Lyndon Johnson, I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 74767
Speaker 1: And you know, when we talk... and sometimes I'm interviewing people... I know the area which you mean. But when it comes to dates, we were just not as tuned to be, "Hey, that was..."  We didn't keep records, it was just a matter of doing something.  It was sometimes being bullish; it was sometimes having an ego, just being there.  I think I worked for... I've had about twenty-six different jobs in my life.  And as I speak to groups during especially Black History Month, I say, "I had twenty-six jobs, half of those I was fired from.  But all of them I left the back door open."  And that's just the way it was.  We were in an era where you were rising, like the tide is rising.  We were told that, you know, that we had these rights.  We were told that we were equal.  And when in fact, the system was just playing our minds to a certain degree.  And there were some of us who really did get some of the advantage.  For example, between maybe '68 [1968] and the late eighties, most of the affirmative action compliance officers that I met in corporate America were high yellow blacks married to non-black women.  Is that by design?  I think so.  So, now...
Speaker 2: When you see a pattern like that--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --you can't help but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But that was reality.  And I remember a lot of them.  There was a gentleman by the name of Van, who was the affirmative action officer for Frontier Airlines where I worked for about seven years, a great gentleman.  And he was just part of the package, and it enhanced his quality of life, and so be it.  I don't fault him, that's just the way... there were some of them who knew how to play the system, and that's good for them.
Story_ID: 74768
Speaker 1: So, getting back to, I guess it was about the newspaper...  Is that where you want to go now?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Now, what did you do after this career as a bodyguard?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Like I said, I worked--
Speaker 2: That takes us to '68 [1968].  And I think the newspaper doesn't start until '85 [1985]?
Speaker 1: Eighty-five [1985]...  '87 [1987], '87, yeah, '87.  I worked as a real estate appraiser for World Savings [Bank] in Denver, Colorado.  There again, my brother, as I said, was living in Denver and I was getting out of a marriage, and I decided the town where the divorce took place wasn't big enough for me and my ex-wife.  (Laughter).  So, I moved to Denver.  And one of his clients needed to have a black real estate appraiser.  And so, I became that black real estate appraiser.  And as I think about it, there were--even though it was good times for me, and I opened some doors for others, World Savings at that time had to take me on because they were under some kind of government status to do so.  But I was not the right color black that they wanted.  And I'll just be, you know, upfront and real with you.  But I was glad I was able to open the door for the high yellow blacks who came after me who were maybe less qualified, and that kind of thing.  So as I look at, you know, life and the way the system is, some of us have to give and take, so that others may stay.  So, I was a real estate appraiser for World Savings Federal Savings in Denver.  I worked for, as a housing consultant and housing program coordinator not only for the Urban League in Miami, but also for the Northeast Denver Housing Center in Denver, Colorado which is still in existence today.  I've also been a GTR, which is a Government Technical Representative for the VA Regional Office here in Westwood, which is L.A. [Los Angeles], California.  And I've implemented a program for all the sub-plus housing that now you can buy more than one.  You can buy up to four properties.  Because we, the government had so many properties out there, and the government did not want to be a landlord.  So, I was able to get that program implemented.  I've been a housing coordinator for the 11th Coast Guard District for the officers and the enlisted men who need housing, you know, land-based housing for administrative staff and that kind of thing.  So, housing has been my main forte until, you know, I became a publisher.
Story_ID: 74769
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did that come to be?
Speaker 2: Actually, publishing came about because I moved to Long Beach [California].  And I had even started a newspaper in Denver, Colorado called The Denver Times, because what I saw there was not representative of a positive, aggressive, forceful black newspaper.  And even though it was short-lived because I moved to California, when I came here in the 36th largest city in America--the number one most diversified city in America--I found no black media.  So, when the job gave out in VA [Veterans Affairs], because it was just for a year, I just told everyone including the unemployment folks, "I'm not going out looking for no job.  I'm going to start a newspaper, and I'm going to do something to hire blacks and others, okay."
Story_ID: 74433
Speaker 1: Well, alright.  Let's continue the story of how you got started with the paper.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll be happy to.  So, when I arrived in 1985 in Long Beach [California], I noticed there was not a media from a black perspective.  I did a windshield feasibility study.  They said, sure we would support it.  And there again, not knowing anything about journalism, but I knew that you need to tell people who, what, where, why, when and how, and that kind of thing.  And you get that in eighth or ninth grade, you know, in English doing essays.  So, we went out and--meaning 'we,' I always talk in the plural; but nobody but me.  And I got the IBM justifiable typewriter and got some legal sized stacks of paper, which is eight and a half by fourteen [8.5 x 14], and I named it The Long Beach Times.  And I went out and I started telling people where jobs were, who was having babies, what kind of opportunities in certain areas, what was going on in the churches, and other information I felt they needed--how to contact their city councilperson, their county representatives, state, local and federal.  And as I proceeded to do that, in a very short time, maybe two or three months, somebody said, "Hey, is that a newspaper?"  I said, "Yeah."  And people began to come and say, "How much would you charge me to put my real estate card in?"  I'm saying, "Oh, maybe I can keep this thing going."  And I'd charge them some ridiculous low fee.  Then about a year later, a gentleman walked into my office and said, "You need a computer."  And his name is Mr. Robinson.  He was working at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] as a custodial engineer, if you want to call it.  And we decided after about an hour's conversation that a computer would cost about seventy-eight hundred dollars with, you know--
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight hundred dollars?
Speaker 2: Yeah, seventy-eight- seven thousand eight hundred dollars.  And this was '87 [1987], '88 [1988].  And of course, that's what computers cost then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we said, "Yeah."  And he said, "You need about eight thousand dollars."  I said, "Oh, boy, that would be a blessing."  And he looked at me and said, "Mr. Love, I'm going to get you that."  And I said, "Okay."  And every week Mr. Robinson would stop by and stick his head in the door and say, "Its coming."  And in the newspaper business, there's a lot of flies on the wall, you might say.  And, but I always respected people and never, you know, put them down or anything; I just tolerated it.  And the third week went by; he'd stick his head in and say, "Its coming."  It took about five or six weeks he did that.  And I just said, "Yes, Sir, Mr. Robinson."  About the eighth week, the mailman brought an eight thousand dollar check in, in the mail.  And I thought it was one of these, you know, Ed McMahon--
Speaker 1: McMahon (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, thin checks.  You know, I'd never seen one.
Speaker 1: Publishing Clearing House.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, Publishing Clearing House.  And it was very thin; I never saw a check like that.  And I just put it on my desk.  And it laid there for about three or four days, until a friend of mine named Willie Glover came in.  And he looked at it, and he said, "Mr. Love, why do you leave your valuables there?"  I said, "Willie, that's not a check, feel it."  He says, "Oh yes, it is."  And he said, "You go and deposit it."  And I looked at it, and I said "Okay."  And I went to the bank and I deposited it. And I was waiting for the bells to ring and the doors to lock and the guards to pull their guns out, and nothing happened.  And the teller said, "Is there something else I can help you with?"  I said, "No, Ma'am."  And I'm saying--I slowly walked out of the bank, and nothing happened.
Story_ID: 74434
Speaker 1: Then I went back the next day to withdraw some of the money.  Well, my checking account at that time had eight thousand one hundred and fifty dollars.  I knew the one hundred and fifty dollars was mine.  (Laughter).  So, I asked the clerk, I said, "Well, I need three hundred dollars."  She said, "Well, Mr. Love, we're supposed to have a hold on this check."  But for whatever reason, she gave it to me.  And I'm saying, this is another trick.  To make a long story short, it was a valid check.  Mr. Robinson came back to see me a couple of days later.  He apologized for taking so long to get me the check, because he had to cash in and redeem some of his CD's [certificate of deposits].  And he took a loss on his CD's, a penalty for cashing them in.  And he told me, "Here's the money for a computer.  You won't see me for a good thirty-five or forty-five days."  Because he was going to take his first train ride across America.  He was retiring as a janitor from UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles].  And that's what he did.  It took me another two to three weeks to buy a computer.  Because after all, it was not my money, and I wanted to use the money in a very prudent way and get the best deal I could possibly get.  And when he came back, he didn't want me to publicize the fact that he had given me the money.  Of course, now we do it.  He just felt that coming from--I think he was coming from Alabama--that the black media was always something to be respected in the black community.  And that's how The Long Beach Times got its first computer, and we got into the real game of doing a newspaper.  And since then it's been an uphill, you know, climb, but I've, you know, taught myself how to operate computers and the different programs.  Others have come in and given me expertise.  And we now, I feel, have a product that's very credible.  We're very well-accepted in the market that we serve.  We have about thirty thousand readers each week who read The Long Beach Times newspaper.  We have a mailing list estimated at about three thousand each week from not only Long Beach [California]--from Biloxi, Mississippi to Chicago [Illinois] to San Diego [California] to New York [New York]; to many of the prisons around the country; to federal, state and local officials that have taken subscriptions to The Long Beach Times.
Speaker 2: Well, this is a remarkable story.  Now, is your benefactor still alive?
Speaker 1: Yes, he is.  Yes, he is.  He's had a bout with cancer, and praise God that he was able to overcome that.  And he's now living a very healthy and productive life.
Story_ID: 74435
Speaker 1: Okay.  That is remarkable.  So, what, what is the mission of your paper, basically?
Speaker 2: The Long Beach Times, we have a three-pronged mission--that being family reunification, you know, building and keeping family structure together; excellence in education by means of getting the information to help you do things--to have a better quality of life.  And of course, the end result is business development, wanting to encourage those who want to be entrepreneurs to be entrepreneurs.
Story_ID: 74436
Speaker 1: In addition to The Long Beach Times, we, I founded and started the Long Beach Black Chamber of Commerce here in Long Beach [California], which is a twelve or thirteen year old organization here.  And we're moving and we're now doing, through the Long Beach Black Chambers, some economic and entrepreneurial skills and seminar training to help blacks in business prosper.  And it's amazing though as we go out, white Chamber members ask us, "Why do you have a black chamber?"  And I say, "For the same reason that the strongest chamber in America is the Korean chamber."  It's that Koreans have different issues than white folks have.  And black folks have a different issue than other chambers.  We have no great grandfathers or no uncles who's going to die and leave us thirty, forty, fifty, sixty thousand dollars.  We have no connections to the financial, you know, world that we can walk in and say, you know, "I need a thirty or forty or a hundred thousand dollar loan."  And the rules of the game, regardless of how they may be printed, is that the average black person in America--I'll give you a good example.  Mr. John Johnson, who owns Ebony and Jet, after he'd been in business almost ten or twelve years and had a gross income of maybe three or four million dollars, still could not walk into a bank and get a hundred thousand dollar loan.  So, these are the issues that are different, as why we start black groups. However, I do believe that all groups should collaborate with each other for the totality of each area's own economic growth and welfare.  I don't believe in separatism, I don't believe that we should--you know, this is my area and this is your area.  I do believe we should be sensitive enough to realize that there are some certain things in the Cambodian culture and community that are Cambodian, and should be relevant and that kind of thing.  But at the same point and view, when we had, for example, this reception for--that's not the one--reception for Mr. Langston, who is the Deputy Director for U.S. Business Bureau out of Washington, D.C.   We had a reception for him, and we had all segments of the community--black, white, Hispanic, Cambodian, Korean, to come into this reception to acknowledge Mr. Langston.  And as long as we can bring together, you know, people of all ethnic groups for the benefit of the whole, that's what we're about.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's- similar reasons a lot of black organizations get started, and people do often ask why they get started.  But, you know, there are specific interests that black people have that others may not have.  And as long as I guess we're a group, we should organize ourselves--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and be considered as a group.
Story_ID: 74437
Speaker 1: So, so what are some of the issues that black people have in Long Beach [California]?  Are there any particular ones that are different from--?
Speaker 2: Well, from where I, you know, sit and feel at this particular moment and date and time, some of the issues as dealing from a black perspective, is changing the mindset of the old guard people, so to speak.  For example, the local NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] here recently held its re-election.  And there was such a showing of, in my opinion, nastiness and pettiness.  Because it's not the organization in my opinion; it's the people in it.  And I think the mission of the NAACP is good.  And every black person--and especially a woman or female in America who may view this program--should attest to the fact that because of where they are today, chances are the NAACP played a great role in getting them there--whether you're a Paula Madison [HM] who is a terrific corporate person with--she's the President and General Manager of KNBC here in L.A. [Los Angeles].  She's the top in her area, and I'm quite sure she would attest that in years gone by, she's standing on the shoulders of someone who fought an issue through the NAACP to get her where she is today, and I think she pays homage to that.  But locally speaking, as I was saying about the NAACP, we get involved in personalities, and get involved in why a person wants to hold a position.  Is it from a personal agenda, which we all have?  But is the personal agenda really subordinate to that of the group?  And sometimes we let our personal agendas, for egos and personal goals and objectives, overcome the real reason why we're holding office.  And it was just a very pathetic shame that, in my opinion, that the election this week of the NAACP officers was done in such a vile and unprofessional and childish manner.  The nominating committee, to be quite frank, the nominating committee returned its slate and did not include the current president to be re-elected.  And there were reasons for that.  And I'm not one wanting to toot, but as a publisher I take the position that there are things that were not brought out.  That is why the nominating committee did not recommend the president, the present president, to continue.  And that was a very vile campaign.  Anyway, she did through hook and nook retain her presidency by doing a lot of things I think, and others have seen, that were not ethical, were not correctly done, and in violation of some of the NAACP rules and regulations.  If that answers that question.
Story_ID: 74438
Speaker 1: That's one issue.
Speaker 2: One issue, yeah.  Now, what was your question again?
Speaker 1: It was, I just wanted to know what some of the issues in the black community were, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I guess the leadership of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] is--
Speaker 2: Is one, yeah--
Speaker 1: --being contested.
Speaker 2: And leadership, period, across the country I think in towns and cities.  Because, you know, we do not have neighborhoods now as we had thirty-five years ago when neighborhoods were distinct, whether they were black or white or Jewish, or whatever.  And we took a survey back in the seventies through the Urban League.  We were funded I believe by the Ford Foundation.  And it clearly stated that if all the amenities for police protection, good recreation facilities, good public service facilities, grocery stores, and retail outlets were in black areas, blacks would stay there.  If it was in white areas, they would still be separated, and that kind of thing.  But because of the economics, and coming down to the dollar amount, dollar figure, people are looking at how do we move from the traditional neighborhoods to the mega malls?  And that has, in my opinion, necessitated as to how urban America is designed today for the so-called middle class.  And thank God, I hope middle class comes back.  But for, you know, middle class and upper middle class and that kind of thing, to have access to their environment and people who are not as upper class, will have access to them.  I don't believe that we will continue to have an existence in America without some turmoil, with the poor over here and the haves over here.  As I mentioned before, during the late sixties and early seventies, we had urban renewal.  To those of us like myself who was a planner at that time for the Dade County Model Cities Program, what it really meant was "nigger removal."  It's that there were programs in place of relocation--sure, we will relocate you, Miss Black Lady, and give you money and give you first opportunity to move back in your neighborhood.  But by the time we had rehabilitated that unit or built whatever we were doing there, the black mothers and families could not afford to move back into their own neighborhood.  So, blacks and housing was pushed further and further back.  It kind of reminds of the facts of what's taking place in America today.  I'm glad that Oprah Winfrey's making the money that they have.  I'm glad the Bill Cosbys are there.  But when you look at the real facts of the matter, Bill Gates--and I can't think of the other individual--still owns the same proportionate--the income that blacks had twenty-five or thirty years ago.  Let me say it another way.  There's been no real difference in income acquisition by blacks in America over the last twenty years than what's happening right now.  We're still the poorest when it comes down to housing.  We're still the worse in getting health care services.  And I think Sammy Davis, Jr, and there was another individual.  It wasn't Rick James, but he was having a heart attack.  And because he was black, the doctors in Denver [Colorado] said, "Oh, you're just having indigestion."  But he was having a heart attack.  So, even if you are well-known and have money, you still cannot receive the adequate medical services in America.  That's a mindset.  But we still contribute to the $294 billion worth of income that we have.  And it's a black/white issue, you know.  And I tell people all the time, "This is their country.  They brought us here, we're just being allowed to live here."
Story_ID: 74439
Speaker 1: Out of all the money Oprah has, but she has no power in my opinion.  Out of all the money and resources that Magic Johnson has, he has no power.  Magic Johnson owns a Starbucks here in Long Beach.  One--that black man cannot, say, advertise in a black newspaper.  And I'll let that sit in for a moment.  These are mindsets.  So, even though we have all this--you know, like I tell people.  If they can pay Michael Jordan whatever amount, forty million, whatever, for a two-year contract or eighty million what do you think the white boy is getting, the owners?  I'm not going to pay you more than I'm going to get; you are a product to me.  And it's like in the media.  And let me know if you need me to stop.  But the media, you look at the media and you see advertisements that Coors and other beers, and that kind of thing.  You do not find malt liquor in the white neighborhoods.  You don't have the Colt .45s in the white neighborhoods.  And it used to disgust me, that every year for--I don't know, twenty years or so--Lou Rawls would do his Parade of Stars thing to raise money for the United Negro College Fund, and his sponsor was Budweiser who put all the beer out in black neighborhoods.  So, it's, you know, I'm saying wow.  Now, he doesn't do it.  Somebody finally got conscious of it.  You cannot go on national TV and play up a company that is poisoning the minds and bodies of our people.  So you look at Pepsi and Coke, who gets a--just recently got a federal--whatever, penalty, three or four hundred million dollars.  That's a drop in the bucket to them.  They don't admit any wrongdoing for black management and treating black management, you know, unfairly.  And black folk don't realize the reason they don't care is that they can say, "Fine, we'll pay the three hundred million."  They get that back in one week's sporting event.  You know how much a Coke costs at a Lakers game?  Or, a Pepsi costs at a Clippers game?  Or at a Grambling College game?  We're still drinking Coke and Pepsi.  So, they get their three hundred million back in one weekend, and "Let's go on to the next issue."  So until we as people of color understand the turnover of the dollar, we will forever, in my opinion, be the wannabe's in our community-we want to look good and dress nice and ride the so-called good-looking cars, but we're problems; we only come in Long Beach [California].
Story_ID: 74440
Speaker 1: We had a sell-out NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] banquet, Freedom Fund, in October.  Five or six hundred people show up.  You will never see no more than ten percent, less than ten percent of those people, come to yearly meetings.  But what they do, they pay their dues.  And they pay their dues through Boeing, who says "Let me give them a five thousand dollar donation."  But nobody white from Boeing attends the NAACP Long Beach Freedom Fund Banquet.  They give it to their black employees who think, "Oh, I got a ticket from Boeing.  I'm going to represent my company."  So, you go and eat some chicken and some cold beans and you look good.  But what, you know, what is really taking place?  Until we can get companies like Boeing--and I'm just using Boeing as an excuse, I mean as an example.  Like the rest of the corporate America, Starbucks, who refuses to advertise in the black media or on black radio.  There is a list of companies in America that we call NUD's, "Not for Urban Distribution."  And these are companies that make their profits off of black dollars.  And as a result, until black folks stop wearing these, you know, designer clothes--and we're the only group of ethnic people in America--grown black men--running around in the streets with a jersey on saying, "2" or "32."  Because the white boy understands that's our mentality.  Until we stop doing this, and putting money back into our own neighborhoods and making sure it goes around three, four, or five times, will we really call ourselves some kind of equal to anybody else in America.  That's just my opinion.  But at 64 years of age, I've been out there, and I'll be John Brown if I will not, you know, speak what I think is some of the reasons why we are the way we are.  As a matter of fact, since this is free-flowing, I look at national organizations--the Greek organizations, the National Urban League, National NAACP, National Council of Negro Women, Farrakhan's group--they're all out there like that, which means that the system loves you when you're like that.  We do not have the consciousness to slowly but surely come together and use all of our resources for the benefit of the whole.  Housing is supposed to be maybe an Urban League thing, I don't know.  Employment is supposed to be an NAACP thing, I don't know.  But I do know the NAACP has been giving marks to hotels because of their non-compliance with employment.  So, that's his thing.  Until we can get the Farrakhans, the Jesse Jacksons [HM], the Mfumbes (ph), the Dorothy Heights [HM], and other people in a room together to collaborate for the good of black America, we will always be in a separate entity within ourselves.  Hopefully, that answers some of your questions about, you know, issues and how I feel about certain things, whether you're in Long Beach [California] or Detroit [Michigan] or Denver [Colorado] or wherever.
Speaker 2: A lot of those issues are alike--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --across the nation.  You know, the one--
Story_ID: 74441
Speaker 1: --Profound one I think that you mentioned early on is the fact that we have big salaries, but no ownership.
Speaker 2: There you go, there you go.
Speaker 1: So, there's no real wealth, you know.  Even with a bigger black middle class, you have a bigger black underclass, too.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, right.
Speaker 1: And so, no wealth to support--
Speaker 2: The gap is widening.  The gap is widening.  I'd like to see blacks become recognized to achieve accomplishments in whatever venue there is.  But then as I talk to them, especially here in Long Beach [California], I ask them "Do you remember the NAACP?"  "No."  People will ask about, "Oh, I've heard about The Long Beach Times, now I see it."  I'm saying, "But you know, it's not your fault," especially to teenagers, even people under thirty-five.  I say, "It's not your fault."  And I really get their attention when I say "It's your mama's fault."  Then they- "Don't talk about my mama."  "But look, your mama has not taught you to look for your own."  My parents told us when we went away to college, to do two things.  When you get there, make sure you join the church and let them know where your home church is.  And two, at least identify somebody in the community--a doctor or lawyer that you can collaborate with.  You know, go and introduce yourself.  Because as a black child, my parents knew years ago that I'm going to need an attorney, someplace down the road.  And why should I, you know, fool myself, thinking that hey, I don't even--so, whatever city we've moved to--and I have to say Mary Lee Jones is a very competent attorney here in Long Beach.  I went and knocked on her door, and we became associates; then we became friends.  She's my attorney.  So, I pay her a certain amount of money each month, not that I need her now, but I'm going to need her.  Because when I need her, I may not have the four or five or six thousand dollars to come up with.  Thank God, I haven't needed her in that respect.  But we need to be taught as to how to do things and how to make do.
Story_ID: 74442
Speaker 1: My father [Roosevelt Love] says, "Why insure against a broken leg? Insure against cancer."  You know, tuberculosis at that time was the thing.  So, when my kids were coming up--hey you get a broken leg, take them to the hospital and pay for it.  But if he gets cancer or TB [tuberculosis], that's the thing that we wanted to be insured against.  And that's the thought pattern that my parents brought us up under.  And like my kids--all of them know once they had a job they were expected to have--after eighteen months of working, to have six months' saving.  Not you know, will be--they were expected to do that.  And they all have done that, and they're all homeowners except one.  And it's just putting priorities where we think they should be.  So, maybe I'm from the old school.  But that's why I say my kids are very pleasing to me, very honorable children, even though they're adults.  But they're doing, I think, what they're supposed to be doing.  And at the same time, they're also sharing and giving back and mentoring and doing things in the community to make it better where they live.
Story_ID: 74443
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell me sir, what are the demographics in Long Beach [California]?  How many black people are here, and where do they live?  Do they live together?
Speaker 2: Blacks in Long Beach is estimated at about 90,000.  The total population in Long Beach is estimated anywhere from 485,000 to a half million depending on who you talk to.  We have about 120,000 Cambodians.  We have the largest population of Cambodians inside Long Beach that's outside the country of Cambodia.  Hispanics run a good, maybe about the same number.  You asked the question, are we all situated in the same place?  No, we live all over Long Beach.  Our most diversified area in Long Beach is in the area called the, the Whittier area, between Long Beach Boulevard and Wardlow, over on that side of town.  You may find the most integrated families, couples, marriages, and that kind of thing.  But it's a very, I'd say maybe middle class area.  You have teachers and blue collar workers and that kind of thing, but you don't have any real serious problems.  We do have race there hating going on, like the rest of the country.  We just had our second black chief of police appointed about fifteen days ago.  And we just had the capture of about a seven or eight year serial rapist that was caught on his watch.  And I talked with him, and he used just good old fashioned police work.  He saw somebody who he thought may be suspect--maybe it was five or six people.  And you just put the old dragnet out, a stakeout.  Just--and sure enough, he looked at them long enough, and boom, and that was the way that he was captured.  But getting back to the demographics here in Long Beach--you- and whites make up the difference.  I don't know, maybe 200,000 or more whites.  But we have a great draw in Long Beach for our tourist attractions--The Queen Mary, our downtown Long Beach Pine Avenue shopping strip.  We just got a new City Place Mall that's one of the best in the country that's just opening.  We have the housing hangar where the Spruce Goose used to be, and it's coming to that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 75149
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I was just wondering, in a town where the black population is so peppered around the city, you know, is it hard to get people to feel like they should be a part of a community or can be part of a community based on their own self-interests, you know, as black people?  Is it, is that... and I think what I'm getting also is that is it a crucial role your paper has to play in pulling these people's interests together, focusing it, you know?
Speaker 1: The way I can respond to that question--because there's a lot of emotions and facts that's running through my mind now.  To answer your question this way:  We do not have the black community the way we had it thirty years ago--from this street to that street.  Even though when we hear old blacks talk about, you know, how they had to invade or integrate Long Beach [California]--how they couldn't live beyond a certain street, and that kind of thing.  That has kind of gone out the window.  Money talks and bullshit walks now, so to speak.  If you've got the money, corporate America sells housing... don't care, you know, what color you are, they want to sell a house.  However, money does dictate as to who lives in certain areas here, and whether it's Long Beach or wherever.  I do know that in Long Beach, we have a wealth of blacks who are accomplished in many mediums and many avocations.  We have a high incident of government, high paying government workers living in the Signal Hill area.  By that I mean Secret Service people, high tech people.  They differentiate by living there, because for some reason the word had gotten out that Signal Hill was where they did the last killing, or the last hanging in southern California, to my knowledge.  Some high school football player, maybe back in...  I think Sellers was his name... just before I came to Long Beach.  I came to Long Beach in '85' [1985], so it maybe happened '82' [1982] or '83' [1983]--was hung in the Signal Hill jail.  So, that sort of put a stigma on quote "the average black person" wanting to live in Signal Hill.  But then there's some premium properties in Signal Hill.  As a matter of fact, I was on the ballot for City Council for Signal Hill, I guess '85' [1985] or '86' [1986].  And one of the supporters who owned a condominium complex said that quite frankly if you do such and such, I could be the owner of one of these condos that had a swimming pool in each complex, and that kind of thing.  But now, blacks have moved to Signal Hill in great numbers.  And the average cost home in Signal Hill is a quarter of a million dollars.  And when you really stop and think, that's not chump change.  On the other side here--and Signal Hill is right in the midst, right in the center of the City of Long Beach.  There are other blacks who have chose to live in other areas, because their excuse have been, or they reasoning have been "I want to get away from the brothers in the hood who are selling dope, who're playing the loud music, who're dressing funky and like thugs," which is good, valid reasons why you want to have a better quality of life for your child. But also on the flip side of that coin is this.  You take the Xerox executive who came here several years ago.  And because he had a half a million dollar salary or whatever, bought a home in a cul-de-sac in an all-white area, and then does not understand why his only daughter gets bombarded everyday with crayons and dirt and, you know, messing up her clothing.  And he doesn't seem to understand.  But he invites no blacks to his home, and no whites invite him to their home in that area, when we really found out about it.  So, the bottom line is that blacks live all over Long Beach.  And for whatever dysfunctional ability we have as a group, we do not seem to realize that you may live wherever you want to live, but you'd better come together, because from years gone by, when they start shooting niggers and realize that you live out in the cul-de-sac and see you mowing your lawn--you may have a PhD written on your sleeve, but so far as the sniper or whoever person is shooting, you're just another dumb-ass nigger in the wrong place, bam.  And until we get that mentality that we're not special blacks, we're not unique blacks because we can work for a certain company or have a certain title or live in a certain neighborhood... we're black America.
Story_ID: 75150
Speaker 1: And there are those of us who have realized...  I'm going to give you a good example, a thing that we did when we was in high school.  We took a class project--and this is before integration.  Went down to the white theater; I had a turban on, and my mama's fake... some kind of costume pin in my forehead on the turban.  And I had my girlfriend dressed up... however... as an Indian, whatever.  And went to the ticket... and said, "Two tickets please."  [with accent]  We were not only not charged to go into the movie, we were escorted to the best seats in the theater, down on the main floor.  But we could not speak English.  But our other classmates were up in the balcony.  That's a mindset.  You can be black, but if you're... you know, if you're, if you're... if you're different and black...  If you're from Trinidad or if you're from what other...  But as long as you're a black American, hey, black get back, white alright.  And this mentality, I think...  And I know I could...  I am rambling because I'm in information overload to a certain degree.
Story_ID: 75151
Speaker 1: But there's a lot of things... I'll give you another example.  We have just had the number one Superintendent of Education retire, Dr. Carl Cowen.  He could have been Secretary under Clinton [President William Jefferson Clinton], of Education, but he was too smart for that.  He's the only superintendent in America who has had the tenure of being the superintendent for as long as he was, over ten or twelve years.  And he was just great, a great communicator is what we called him.  And now he retired.  But I think it's something that Dr. Cowen shared with me some time ago.  He says, "Love, I have never been asked to come to a black organization and talk about education from a black perspective," as long as he was superintendent of education.  Oh, blacks would come to him when there were problems.  "When my kid was expelled, when my kid got..."  But never about...  And so when he would have to go to other ethnic groups, he had to speak on education from a Hispanic point of view, or from a white point of view, or from a Cambodian point of view, which is just more so right.  And when we think about these things--we have all this expertise in our community, but we don't use it.  We don't collaborate and pull it together.  However, we are working in that direction.  Because the BBPA, which is the Black Business and Professional Association of Long Beach, which is having their 6th Annual Economic Summit Workshop on the 23rd of this month--they have a strong leader in the form of a lady named Emily Fields, who is president.  And she has seen fit to bring about a mindset.  She refuses to just have the BPA sit as a committee to decide what's going to take place at their organization summit.  She is demanding, and has demanded, and has good support that she is identifying other blacks and other organizations to come to the table and say, "How should we put on our BBPA 6th Annual Summit?  What would you like to collaborate with?  What would you like to see us do?  What would... part do you want to play?"  And until others take this same, I feel, kind of approach--is that we all need to be involved with whatever is taking place whether it's the black community or the white community. However, I do feel that someplace down the road we've got to stop talking separatism in the way that it is now.  We've got to talk inclusion versus exclusion.
Story_ID: 75152
Speaker 1: I think Emily Fields, who is bringing this summit here, is not just looking at black key players, she's looking at Hispanic key players; she's looking at white key players.  And I'll be very specific.  The Long Beach area Chamber of Commerce has always been here.  And people are wondering now why we call it the white chamber.  Well, it was the only chamber, and it was white.  So, you didn't need to call it white.  Now, you've got several other chambers, which is the Hispanic Chamber and the Latino Chamber, or the Korean Chamber and the Cambodian Chamber and the Black Chamber.  So when people, especially when I talk, I differentiate between what chamber I'm speaking to.  You know, you cannot just say "The Long Beach area chamber" and not designate that that's a white chamber.  And I tell them all the time that there was no need for me to join the white chamber, when several years ago, maybe eight or nine years ago, they not only grandfathered me but they gave me a courtesy membership.  Why?  Because they needed to have someone that looked like me on a governmental committee so that they could get some federal funds.  But I still tell them all the time, it doesn't make sense for you as a Cambodian businessperson to do business with me just because I'm black.  You should do business in a survival mode at all times.  If there's a mother, father, sister, cousin, uncle, nephew, who can provide you services or products at a reasonable cost, you should use them.  However, if there is, from a black perspective--and we're the only people who do this--we do not seek out our own to enhance our economic growth.
Story_ID: 75153
Speaker 1: We will forever take our--I just get so many thoughts.  Twenty years ago there were black cleaners all over America, you know.  I mean we were... there were great restaurants.  My mother [Ophelia Love] would tell you right now, when they started integration, she says, "Oh, I thought it was nice.  But where are all of our black teachers?  Where are all of our black fine restaurants?"  And this is what integration has done.  Integration in my opinion has said to the un-thinking black person, "Oh, I can go to..." what is it, Nessen Marcuson (ph.), or whatever?
Speaker 2: Neiman Marcus.
Speaker 1: Nekan Marcuson (ph.), or to what...  And I can try on they shoes and try on their bathing suits now.  But why don't you go to the Village Treasures which is a black owned boutique and have the finest fashions, and it's black owned?  You see, or why don't you go to the black owned Chevrolet dealer when you want to buy a Chevrolet?  You have my Asian friends... and I applaud them for doing it.  But they drive all the way over to Al Hamburg, thirty miles away, to buy from their nephew who owns the dealership.  That's economic survival.  And I tell people sort of a scenario all the time.  If my father owned Southwest Airlines, he would have all black pilots, all black staff until white folks start flying.  And once white folks start flying, I could just see my father saying, "Ophelia, I see white folks are flying, and it's about three percent.  Maybe we need to hire some white folks to load the airplanes.  So, when them white folks who's flying the plane look out, they say, 'See, Mr. Love's airline practices fair...  Look, he got that white person down there, you know, loading my things.'"  Then as more and more white people would fly my father's black airline, I would eventually hear my father saying to my mother, "Ophelia, I've got to hire me some white flight attendants.  Because now thirteen percent of our plane loads is white folks."  That's good, sound, business sense.  But someplace down the line, this thirteen percent need to be respected.  And the way I think, across America, if we're going to give you... going after my two or three billion dollar... three hundred billion dollar surplus expendable income... you need to take some of our institutions just like you do whites--newspapers, black radio.  And for the life of me I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired of hearing black folks say, "You know, but we don't own our own hotels."  Well, damn it, as long as you have leaders, national known leaders, who are not there for the good of the people--the NAACP, National Council of Negro Women, Alphas, Omegas, you name it.  Until they come to the table in a collaborative effort and say, "Wait a minute.  We're spending forty, fifty million dollars a year.  Let's go buy one."  So, for all intents and purposes now, we have one owned black resort top quality black owned hotel resort in America.  And that's the Royal Palm Plaza in Miami, Florida; that general manager is a very good friend of mine, Jesse Stewart.  But how many black folks know that?  Because we're in business--not to push it as a black hotel--we're in business to provide services and products for anybody who wants to come and need a hotel and need banquet facilities or need anything else that the Hiltons and the Hyatts have done over the years.  And until we deal with that direction, I think we will always be what I consider to be a beggar race of people in America.

Speaker 1: When you look back over your career with this paper, what do you think at this point--I know you have some more things to do.  What do you consider the legacy of this paper so far?  Or, your legacy?
Speaker 2: As...  And I've been in the... what do you call it?  I'm not the first black to start a newspaper here, but I've been told, and through our research, the first one that has lasted this long.  So, I'm standing on someone else's shoulders in reference to, you know, the black newspaper here in Long Beach.  I think that we as blacks still play the game of personality fusion.  By that, I mean we don't know who owns, let's say the white newspaper.  But we buy it, we loyally buy it.  They see me as the black publisher, who walks the streets, attend churches, attend meetings; go to their funerals.  But for some reason, we have this what I call this Democratic slave mentality.  I'm a Republican, by the way.  We have this Democratic slave mentality that, "Oh, if it's black, it ought to be free.  Or, if you're black, you ought to do it for free.  If you're black, why don't you pay back by not charging?"  Like last night we heard an associate of mine, Les Brown [HM], here in Long Beach [California].  It was billed as a, you know, no charge, free admission.  But at the same time, they had to take up an offering.  And they were asking for a hundred dollars, you know, as the least amount.  And that kind of turned people off.  They would have, I think, received more in the offering had they just let it flow and say, "Hey, we got Les Brown.  Let's show him our appreciation."  And that's...  I know I flipped pages on you.
Story_ID: 75155
Speaker 1: By that I mean, it turns us off.  And I know I want to share some things that maybe you haven't come up with, as to what might be one of the main reasons why blacks are as dysfunctional in America as we are.  And for that, I put the black church at the top.  Without the black church being the way it is we would be much further on the way to full employment, I believe, full economic infusion, full... a lot of things.  And I think the black church has taken the role, has taken the spirituality out of its church and put business.  And people used to come to churches, or leave churches because quote, "They have a--they were called."  Now, I think people go into becoming pastors because it's a great avocation to make money in.  I think we--
Speaker 2: Now, wait a minute now.  So some would say, they would say "Well, the black church is the reason why we're free today."
Speaker 1: True.
Speaker 2: And the reason we're, the reason why we have any cohesion at all.
Speaker 1: True.
Speaker 2: To talk about the church, you know, is...  You know, that's how people talk about the church.
Speaker 1: Yeah, true, and I agree with it.  The black church then, before the turn of, let's say the fifties, the fifties [1950s] and the sixties [1960s].  The black church then--I remember the Reverend Heath where I was brought up.  They were about spiritual guidance and teaching.  Not mistaking that anything has to have money to survive.  You've got to have money for lights and air-conditioning and that kind of thing.  But to the point now, just in my opinion, it's whether or not, you know, the mega churches... a) It ain't about spirituality.  In my opinion, it's about "Can I have a church bigger than Fred Price?  If I have a church bigger than Fred Price, then I can get a house like Fred Price and have elevators in it."  You know--
Speaker 2: Elevators?
Speaker 1: Yeah, elevators.  Yeah, you know, he got elevators in his house.  We had a church to buy the Western Forum which was a great business deal, you know, here.
Speaker 2: A church bought the Western Forum?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Where the Lakers used to play?
Speaker 1: Right.  So the church now is, in some opinions, party to corruption, drug abuse, and a whole lot of other things.  Because that's what happens at these concerts, I understand when they're there.  They don't care whether it's owned by a church.  So, entertainment is entertainment, regardless of who owns it.
Speaker 2: The church rents the space out for concerts?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah.  Yeah, concerts... whatever needs...
Speaker 2: Secular concerts?
Speaker 1: There you go, there you go... there you go.  I mean, you know, Grateful Dead, whoever... you know what happens at those places. What I'm saying is they have a right to do that.  And they may challenge their thing by saying, "Look, we're into economic development."  But at the same time, is it taking money from one bad environment to pay on your church--which is supposed to be a Christian thing--because the congregation is not doing it?  I don't have the answer, but it doesn't feel too comfortable with me.  I've never heard it explained as to why, but it was a business deal.  I keep saying prosperity is one thing.  And I keep hearing these preachers say... you know, the Cadillacs and the Benz.  But at the same time...  I don't know, I'm from the old school.  I don't think Jesus needed a limousine to get from point A to point B.
Speaker 2: And Jesus wasn't rich, was He?
Speaker 1: Well, rich in, you know, supposedly... you know, we own everything.  God, His Father owns everything.  So--
Speaker 2: He didn't have like the finer... Did he have the finer... did he have the finest clothes or the finest--?
Speaker 1: I don't, I don't think so.  I don't think so, or whether that was his mission.  So, anyway, that's, that's an argument that, you know, is a win-loss thing.  Because everybody's right when it comes down to religious preference and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 75156
Speaker 1: But getting back to your question about blacks and some of the issues that we really face, not just here in Long Beach [California], but living... and demographics and whether or not we smile.  We are intimidated by each other.  We're intimidated by the brother who may come down the street in a five hundred dollar Batley suit versus the brother who has on an eighteen dollar pair of overalls.  And we put things in perspective as how we perceive.  And the person in the overalls could be his best blessing that he's ever going to have.  But we are programmed to perceive things as being a wannabe or the "real be" so to speak.  So, I'm like most people; I smile a lot, I speak to people regardless of who they are.  I just do my thing in trying to bring about a person's better day for that day.  And I just go from day to day on that thing--
Story_ID: 75157
Speaker 1: Now, you asked me about The Long Beach Times and how, what kind of legacy--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we're going to leave.  We try to stay focused on family, education, and business development.  We are not a--I believe starting, that everyone is imperfect.  So, being black, we've always heard the fact that you've got to be a hundred and fifty percent better in America to really be recognized.  We have printed a newspaper going on sixteen years, seventeen... just like the white newspaper.  But we only get called by black folks because we've made a typo or an error.  They don't pay us the $45 a year subscription, but they pay $178 a year subscription to the white newspaper, who has hundreds of typos in it.  But they never call the white boy on the carpet.  They always call the black publisher.  And I understand that.  So, what we did was to create a couple of times a perfect newspaper, and didn't get one phone call.  So, we played a game; we purposely make typos in the newspaper.  And when people call, we realize for every one call that's about maybe two or three hundred people that's reading it.  And we apologized for the mistake.  But we say when we hang up the phone, "We got him."  We challenged him, did he mis-interpret the article?  "No, I understood the article.  You read it."  That's what we do after we hang up the phone.  So as long as we're communicating and trying to "KISS" it, "Keep it Simple, Stupid," we think that we're doing something good.  Now, about what legacy we're going to be leaving?  I would like to leave the legacy that The Long Beach Times business plan is going to be fulfilled, meaning that the business plan calls for this newspaper to be printed three times a week.  It can happen.  We're still collaborating with the resources to do that.  But there is, there are forces that don't want this to happen.  When I say that, the average person says, "Oh, three times a week."  But when certain people hear that, that means that you're talking about a change of power, a shift of power.  And this is what happened when we went to Cal State Long Beach.  The president, Robert Maxim, we were on several boards and committees together.  And he very politely provided some graduate students for this non-profit group to come up with a marketing plan.  But when I went to visit him to ask him to identify two graduate students in communications and business to help with the Long Beach Times, he said, "Oh, I can do that."  And he said, "But what's your objective?  Where do you see The Long Beach Times going?"  I said, "Dr. Maxim, if you provide these two students for me, within eighteen months The Long Beach Times can be printed three times a week."  This president turned as red as you want to see a white boy turn, because he's quick and he's sharp, realizing that if I help this black newspaper print three times a week... what I'm doing, I'm challenging the doctrine of shift of power.  Can you realize how many minds that we can change, and how many mindsets and how many other things we can do by printing three times a week?  I don't know if you have really read The Long Beach Times.  We don't deal in news that you find day to day.  We don't deal in sensationalistic stuff, we don't deal in plane crashes.  You know, it's just a different plane crash, a different city, a different pilot, different airline.  You can only do so...  What we deal with is trying to deal with mind-changing philosophies, mind-changing information that you just don't get in the major media.  And that, I believe will be part of the legacy we'll be leaving as the newspaper who helped change the mindset of the some of the people in Long Beach [California].

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, for yourself personally, did your parents get a chance to see you become, start this paper?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yes, both of my parents did.
Speaker 1: Your mother [Ophelia Love] is still... is still--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, my mother is still alive, bless her heart.  So, she's 88.  And I missed calling her today and I missed calling her yesterday.  But she's been out of place, so I figure she's running the street someplace, since we were able to get her to stop driving.  So, she commandeered somebody's car who comes to visit her to take her wherever she goes.  But we normally call her every two to three days.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, she was able--and she gets it every week.  And she'll call and tell me what she likes about it, or what she doesn't like about it, and that kind of thing.  And my father [Roosevelt Love] was able to see it for the first couple of years, because... before he passed.
Story_ID: 75159
Speaker 1: So, I know you still got a lot to do.  But how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Wow.  Boy.  You know, knowing me, I'm a very--and I say this.  I'm not the most cordial person when it comes to socialization.  You asked me a question, and I've been very, very moderate in our conversation here today.  I'm, I'm, I'm... some would consider me abrasive, direct.  For example, I have no problem with the word nigger.  White folks have got four or five hundred years' start on calling us niggers and that kind of thing.  So, if somebody's uncomfortable with that, that's their lack of history and that's their mindset as how America has programmed this word of nigger.  And I used to be probably a good nigger, you know, to white folks when I was coming up.  You asked me about Hahira, Georgia.  Hahira, Georgia, I remember one time when I went there.  I was about twelve or thirteen, and I took a friend with me.  And we were walking down the main street, which is only about two or three blocks.  And one of the old white fellows was sitting there, and he said something like, "Are you one of them Love nigger boys?" or something like that, he said.  Well, if it had been back in St. Petersburg [Florida], that would have been maybe a fighting thing.  But that was part of the colloquial situation there in Hahira.  He didn't mean any harm by that.  That was... and this man was like 92 years old.  And what I looked at is that he remembered who I was.  He remembered my grandmother.  And how many of... from how he came up...  It was the accepted thing at that time.  It was the order of the time-set.  So, we had no problem with that.  But now, when we go back now it's not...  You know, they have either died out or there's a new marshal in town.  So, you asked me how I would like to be remembered.  As someone who really, who cared about life; cared and shared.  And that's about it, cared and shared.  That is, that is... that is... no other...  You know, I could go on about my kids and that kind of thing.  They know I care about them, and they know I share with them.  So, even to the people here in Long Beach [California], I share and I care, period.
