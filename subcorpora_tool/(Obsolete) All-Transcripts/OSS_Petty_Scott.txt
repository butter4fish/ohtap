 Gill. I   m interviewing Scott Petty. Today is August 19,  2008 and we   re in the Edmon Low Library in the Angie Debo room. I   m  a faculty member at the Oklahoma State University Library and this  interview is being conducted as part of the O-STATE Stories Project of  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Well Scott, let   s start off  a little bit in asking a kind of a basic question as a Pistol Pete. Can you  remember the first time you saw Pistol Pete?  You know, I don   t remember the exact first time I saw Pete. I know the  first time I came to Oklahoma State as a young man was with my  parents for a football game in    77 and so I have a feeling that is the first  time I saw Pistol Pete. And from that moment on though   actually  before that moment, I was a Cowboy because my parents and  grandparents had all attended Oklahoma State. We had a long tradition  here.  What was your first impression of Pistol Pete?  I think my first impression of Pistol Pete was   it was an awesome  character. It was very stoic, you know, there   s not a lot of animation in  the face like some other mascots at some other schools. But it   s a very  imposing mascot because the hat is so broad and so tall and you put that  on a six foot tall guy   s head and it   s pretty imposing. And that   s scary to  little kids. It can be very intimidating to children and even to some  adults. I found that especially international students would have  difficulty  with him . I   m jumping ahead, but   they didn   t like the idea  that there   s this big guy in a head. There   s no facial expression or  movement.  Scott you alluded it to, when you first uprooted your family. Could we  just back up a little? Tell us a little bit about your growing up, your kind  of history and how you found your way to Oklahoma State University.  5  Petty  Gill  Petty  Sure. Sure. I grew up in Guymon, I was born in McAlester, Oklahoma  but all my school days were in Guymon. My folks moved out there in  1970 and so first grade through high school was spent in Guymon. My  parents both attended Oklahoma State. My older sister attended  Oklahoma State, my grandparents   so we have a long history here. But  growing up in Guymon, I was in speech and debate and choir and wasn   t  the most athletic guy, but I always enjoyed athletics. I loved sports.  When I came to Oklahoma State and joined a fraternity, it was probably  the first time I was really exposed to Pistol Pete and the mascot and all  those athletics events first hand. I don   t know if that   s a good  characterization. I think that was kind of the start of realizing my stage  was more in being animated in a character. I was class clown my senior  year which sometimes is not a great thing to be proud of in high school.  But I think that kind of set me on a track to have Pistol Pete very much  appeal to my senses.  Scott Petty is just a guy, not as Pistol Pete. Can I ask you about your  OSU experience apart from Pete. Some of the things you mentioned  being in a fraternity. Can you share some highlights from just your  student experience at Oklahoma State?  Growing up in Guymon five hours away, you   re not really exposed to  Greek life and a lot of those things. And I had a couple of guys from  different fraternities drive out to recruit me or rush me. But I moved into  Kerr Hall. Lived in 423 Kerr my first year, my first semester actually.  My roommate was a buddy from high school   still a good friend today.  But I realized he had a girlfriend and I didn   t. So, they were spending a  lot of time together and I thought,    Man, there   s got to be more to this  than what dorm life was offering Scott.    So I kind of went through the  fall rush and joined Delta Tau Delta and man that was the greatest  decision I ever made. I moved in a week later than all the other pledges,  so by the time I got there, grace week was kind of over and it was pretty  serious. We were learning history about the fraternity and I realized I  had school work to do but I really enjoyed that experience.  It really magnified my OSU experience because I did become involved  in VR, Varsity Review and Spring Sing. I was the emcee one year each  for Varsity Review and Spring Sing. That was a fantastic experience.  We had a lot of fun with that. I was involved in J-Board one year. I was  rush chairmen for our fraternity. And as you know, continued that rush  experience after college whenever I worked in high school and college  relations just like you did. I was thinking this morning as I was coming  up here those kids that I recruited came to Oklahoma State 19 years ago.  That   s hard for me to accept, Jerry. I know it   s real hard for you to  accept.  6  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Their kids will be coming to school. (Laughter)  Yeah, exactly  Exactly. But that kind of led me into being exposed to  Pete, as I mentioned. The fraternity life kind of thrusts you into those  experiences and really they encourage involvement in college. Not that  the dorm life didn   t. It just wasn   t as evident that this was a great  opportunity. The fraternity really did a lot to mold and shape my OSU  experience, which I   m very thankful for. I have tremendous friendships  coast to coast and I still talk to a lot of those guys regularly. And that   s  neat.  Well you kind of told me about your background but when did you really  first think about wanting to be a Pete? Can you remember kind of your  thoughts?  Oh, I remember it vividly. A guy in our house was Pistol Pete, Rick  Wilson. And as I mentioned to you, he was our first All-American at  Oklahoma State. He was this awesome character, had a very vibrant  personality, very outgoing, very   just charisma. I got to know him and I  realized,    Hey, anybody can try out for this.    It   s not, you know   it was  evident that   and he was very encouraging. He was the alternate the  year that I started paying attention more to Pistol Pete at events where  you would see Pete. I asked Rick about what   s all involved and how the  interview process goes. He gave me some open access in trying the Pete  head on to see if I really thought that would be something   what I  thought it was going be. And it   s always so much more than you think.  But anyway, that experience and getting to know Rick was a fabulous  door opener.  Consequently, I was Pete the following year and then Lance Millis,   Pistol Pete in 1987-1988  who was also in our fraternity, was Pete the  next year. I found a letter for Lance in my stuff and he had written me a  very thoughtful letter. I   m sure he doesn   t remember it. I had kind of  forgotten it. But I found it in my archives up in the attic and I just  thought you know those are the kinds of experiences in college you look  back fondly on and appreciate so much.  Scott, could you describe the tryout process a bit for us. I   m sure Rick  kind of helped prompt you a little bit.  He did.  What did he do?  Yeah well in fact Jerry, the last   well I guess for 17, 16 years now I   ve  been very involved in the selection process of Petes. That   s a  7  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  tremendous honor and really a fun experience but gladly will tell you  how that goes. Anyone can apply. In fact we   ve had female applicants  that have done very good. But I think once they get in there and realize  the head   s heavy and it gets to be kind of long in parades and birthday  parties and indoor events where you got to watch chandeliers and those  kinds of things. But it   s an interview process where Pete comes in.  There   s a panel of at least four, maybe five judges. Tracey Wittwer has  sat in on them as the Spirit Group advisor here for the last probably eight  or so years   six or eight years. Although, she doesn   t have a lot of  input, she   ll ask questions and if we come down to a tie or something  she   ll chime in and give her two cents, which is very valuable.  And that panel includes you said some former Pistol Petes     Former Petes.     athletic department people?  No primarily former Petes. They   re pretty much the decision makers,  which is neat, because I think who knows best the qualities and the  expectations of Pete than those former Petes. But a couple times we have  Tracey as I mentioned. She is an athletic department employee so she   s  in there. But we interview them. We grill them about their GPA, their  activities   the other activities and responsibilities they have during  college and if they have a job. Because it   s a full time job doing 300 to  400 appearances and I think that now they maybe exceed 400  appearances a year with all the birthday parties and alumni events and  all the activities that is required. So it   s a big time commitment and we  need them to understand that.  I remember very clearly the sophomore year before I tried out for Pete,  my grades were not that great. Had Rick Wilson not mentored me and  tutored me along on how to be Pete and how to do well in the interview  process, I probably wouldn   t have been Pete on my grades. My grades  the next semester were better, the next semester were better. It helped  me manage my time better amazingly enough. Reflecting on it I don   t  know how I did it. I don   t know how athletes today are able to make the  grades they do and compete.  But that process   the try out process, we put the head on them and we  put them in situations and say,    How do you react if       And walk them  through a difficult scenario where an obnoxious fan from the other team  is in your face and try to see   are they humble? Do they project the  image that Oklahoma State expects? And can they do that in character?  And are they in character  snaps  from the moment they put the head on?  That   s key. And you have to look good under the head. You want it to be  8  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  proportionately right as well. So those are some things we look for and  that whole interview. We   ll have anywhere from about twelve to fifteen  guys a year try out. As I mentioned we have had females try out, but  typically we   ve had twelve to fifteen people try out and that interview  process lasts 15 to 20 minutes depending on the candidate.  Scott, you talked about Rick Wilson being an alternate and used to have  a Pete in alternate. Are there now two Petes? Is that right?  That   s correct.  Do you select two?  There are two Petes.  When you did it was there still the one and the alternate?  That   s a great question. My second year  1986-1987  was the first year  we made two Petes. Because of the number of activities Pete began to do  in the mid-   80s, it just was increasing and it was evident we needed two  Petes. In fact Jerry, we   ve talked about having three Petes. And we do in  fact select an unnamed third candidate these days so if somebody does  fall down on their grades or they have to leave school for some reason,  have a tragedy or whatever, then we   ve got a third Pete ready to go that  we know can do it. We   ll have guys try out two, three, four times to be  Pete and get it their third or fourth time. So the guys   and we tell them,  we have great guys every year. Sometimes the decision is so difficult  and I remember the feeling of being alternate. Thinking, wow   Rick  deserves it. He was the alternative the year before and now he   s Pete. I  remember thinking what a great guy to learn under. And then later that  year he became the All-American mascot and since then we   ve had  several guys who have been All-Americans, which is just fantastic  So your Pete now, looking at his outfit, can you tell me a little bit about  the uniform and the head?  Sure, Tener   s outfitted us. They gave us these cool western shirts that  said Tener   s on the cuff and maybe it said it back here on the collar.  They gave us like four of those shirts and three pairs of jeans, a pair of  boots. We got a new pair of boots each year   wore them out. I mean  with all the walking and stumbling around that Pete does you wear out  the sides of them cause your walking bow legged. But at first I thought,     Wow  That   s kind of going over the top. The university gave me a pair  of boots.    I was wearing my own boots to try out and then I realized it   s  part of the gig. We had the chaps which have kind of changed and  modified a bit over the years. It   s pretty much the same style that I wore  9  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  from    85 to    87. And then we had a black vest, the gun belt, and then I  had my own belt which you know I bought this belt buckle in about    77,     78 when I was coming up here for my first OSU games. In pictures I  can identify that   s me partially because I   m skinny as a bean pole, and  partially because I   ve got this belt buckle that   s pretty identifiable. Then  we had the head, of course, and that weighs a lot.  Where was the head made? Is it Disney?  Walt Disney created the head and the designer   in fact they found the  mold several years ago. I want to say it was probably about 20 years ago  about the time I was Pete and they made another head from that as the  backup. Because there were two heads. One was kind of   it wasn   t  paper machete but it was a much lighter material and it weighed about  14 pounds. That was the one I wore most of the time when I was  alternate. Then the other one that was made, like I said probably 22  years ago   around that time frame, that was a heavier plexi-fiber glass.  It weighs almost 40 pounds.  The great thing about it is it   s setting on your shoulders and its got a  hard hat welded kind of inside so you   ve got great control. It   s not as  awkward as the 14 pounder. I would rather wear the 40 pounder on any  day of the week, just because it   s a little more comfortable. That  fourteen pound one had a little point that would hit you right in the chest  and I kept thinking,    Man, I feel like I   m   maybe I   m having a heart  attack, I got a bruise here.    Well, it was the bottom point of the hat  would hit me every time I would look down for a child, or look down for  anything. It would just hit me in the chest and I wouldn   t realize I got  this bruise. Finally I realized   I built up, I kind of bulked up like you  Jerry. (Laughter)  Scott you mentioned all the activities. Most people see Pete at athletic  events but you did a lot more appearances   public appearances than  just athletic events. Can you kind of talk about the mix or the kind of  appearances you made? You said somewhere in the neighborhood of  400 or so?  I know I didn   t do 400 when I was Pete. It was probably more around  the neighborhood of 150-200. Between Rick and I, we may have done  about 400. I think now each Pete may do close to 400. It   s amazing the  kinds of things we do. I mean parades, birthday parties, weddings. Lance   Millis  came to my wedding as Pistol Pete. You go to nursing homes.  You go to hospitals. You go to all these different alumni events. That  was one of the places I first got an exposure to the alumni and the  Foundation. I did a Foundation Board of Governors    deal. It was around  Halloween and Dr. Boger and I, we took that head and put a sheet  10  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  around it so it looked like a ghost   cut out eye holes. I got a picture of  Dr. Boger and I stirring the cauldron together. And so those kinds of  events people don   t, unless you   re real involved in alumni activities, you  don   t see those kinds of things. But then all women   s athletics, all men   s  athletics. I think I said parades and birthday parties.  Let   s see, I did several events at schools. One of them was a Read  Across America type deal where we talked about the importance of  reading. Another one was over in Enid that I recall and the Boomer  Schooner was there and so we had our picture made. I   ve got that in my  collection of things that I   m most proud of. A lot of neat events like that  that you don   t think are necessarily going to be impactful when you   re  trying out. You   re thinking about all the glorious things where people  see Pete in public but sometimes the most memorable and most  impactful things are those smaller activities like that reading event that I  did at Mid-Del Schools. I remember those things very well. I think they  make a big impact. Certainly made a big impact to those classes that you  are with. Not that you don   t make a big impact in front of 50,000 people  at a football game.  We talked a bit earlier about the hat. Are there some rules, Pistol Pete  rules? Dos and don   ts that you had?  Well, there certainly are and probably the biggest is that you always  want to think that there is always a pair of eyes on you. And whether  they   re eight years old or 80 years old, you   ve got to remember that you  are representing your alma mater and your university. As a college  student that   s a lot to shoulder. It   s really important to remember that.  As far as written dos and don   ts, I pulled out a minute ago, you know,  some rules by the     Read some of them for us     Well, let   s see. All right, I don   t know if you knew that Cowgirl Golf  used to have their own calendar? Yeah. (Laughs) I mean, now do we  have a calendar for every sport these days?  One of the perks of being Pete.  Yeah, exactly one of the perks of being Pete. Let   s see, I   ve got it here.  Here are the    Oklahoma State University Spirit Group Regulations.     And I mean, there   s fifteen. There   s attendance policies, there   s travel  policies, there   s replacement procedures, leadership, very detailed  expectations were laid out for us and this was   attending camp  activities. We would host camps for cheerleaders and then there would  be this mascot division where we would help mascots. So I judged  11  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  mascot tryouts at Cushing and different schools like that. That was very  cool, very neat experience.  Scott, what is it about the head and public appearance, there   s a rule  you   re supposed to   what is that?  Never speaking, you mean? Not talking?  Never speaking and not taking your hat off.  Yeah, you never want to expose the fact that there is a human  underneath there. And there is an unwritten rule that mascots just don   t  talk. They   ll talk to each other if they   re trying to set up a situation. Or if  Pete   s in trouble or needs to convey, usually we would call a cheer  leader and say,    Hey can you get that mother to bring that child over and  I   ll take a picture with them. It   s fine.    So you might communicate that  way. But if people ask you any questions, for one thing if you   re in a  large group you can get inundated with questions. They can   t hear you  very well but it is kind of an unwritten rule. Mickey Mouse is never  going to talk to you; Pistol Pete is not going to talk to you. And then you  just   yeah the head you   re only going to take that off kind of behind the  scenes. People are going to see you remove it at a basketball game  behind the stands but we try to do it in an area where people don   t see  who is being uncovered as the mascot.  Scott, can you remember the very first time you stepped out on a football  field or the basketball arena   your feelings, your emotions? Can you  capture that moment for us?  Well that   s hard to do. I will tell you the chill factor is huge. I mean, it   s  like having someone pay you a compliment or hearing that song that just  it really touches a tone with you. But the hair stands up on the back of  your neck and you think you   re just so prideful about that moment and  how meaningful it is to you and maybe your family that   s there as well. I  remember thinking I can   t believe I   m able to represent my university in  this way, and what a meaningful expression and probably the biggest  thing I could have done for our university outside of representing later  OSU in the Alumni Association and the Foundation. That to me was the  pinnacle of my college career.  Is there a particular sporting event you enjoy more than the others? Or  did you like the experience at the football game versus the basketball  game?  Well, first of all I loved basketball. We still love basketball. Gerri and I  love to go to basketball games. And our kids love them, at least our son  12  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  does. Our daughter could sit there and read a book for the entire game.  But you know basketball was always thrilling. Even under Coach  Hansen when we weren   t necessary selling out the crowds, the stadium  or the arena. Those were still a blast for me. Wrestling, the first time I  ever went to a wrestling match. And my dad was a Beta  Theta Pi  with  Myron. Myron was out of school but he came back I think and wrestled  all the Betas or taught them to wrestle or I don   t know. But anyway     wrestling was big. And I never really understood it because we didn   t  have wrestling in Guymon. But Dad always talked about how exciting  the wrestling matches were and I had never gone to a wrestling match  until I had to be a Pete at one.  So I went to the first one and watched Rick and it was something I  thought,    I don   t really think I can get into that.    I went to that first  wrestling match and John Smith and Kenny Monday and Mike Sheets  and all these guys that were just amazing athletes. It gave me a true  appreciation of what they do and of course you know the history now of  Oklahoma State or forever has been tremendous. But I do remember  wrestling was and still is as exciting as can be to go watch. You don   t  have a lot of room to move around at wrestling, but with basketball  you   ve got the time outs and you can do a lot more with props and things  in basketball that people can see. If you   re in a football stadium and  people are 50 yards away from you it   s really kind of hard for them to  get what you   re doing down there other than firing people up. But at  basketball games you can tie up a bear and drag it across the court when  you   re playing Baylor and you know you can punch an old dog like it   s  the top dog at OU. The fans enjoy that kind of stuff.  The character Pistol Pete, of course after the historical person Frank  Eaton     Frank Eaton.     Frank    Pistol Pete    Eaton. So an important two part question, Scott.  One is what do you remember historically about Pete, you know Frank  Eaton? And what characteristics did you try to portray when you were  in public appearances that you recall about Pistol Pete?  Frank Eaton was a very colorful character. His past is, you know, very  colorful I guess is the nicest way to say it. And Lance Millis, by the way,  is probably of all Pistol Petes, he is probably the most knowledgeable  about Frank Eaton history. I admire the fact that he has done so much  research on Frank. But getting to know his daughter, Elizabeth Wise,  and you know some of those things were really meaningful. But Frank  was a crusty guy. I mean he was an old cow hand and he was a federal  marshal and the best shooter. I mean that   s how he got his name  13  Gill  obviously you think of him as being a tremendous marksman that  outshot everybody at Fort Gibson. All of those things come to mind but  then also there was this edgy side of Pete. And you know, Pete would  kind of sometimes push the envelope a little bit at some events with  certain other teams when you were playing them. So Pete kind of maybe  represented a little bit about what Frank Eaton was all about.  I recall a game in particular, we were playing OU. It   s memorable for  many reasons. One Brian Bosworth hit me in the head at that game and  there   s a story with that too, Jerry. They were having a moment of  silence for an alum who had passed away and I   m kneeled down. I   ve  got the head off and I   m like out of the view of everyone almost at the  edge of the ramp, coming onto the field. Everybody in the stadium at  OU has got their head bowed. It   s my first Bedlam game to ever do in     86. I   ve got my head down. I   m kneeled down on one knee and I can  see coming behind me a shadow out of the corner of my eye. And all of  a sudden I feel a whack in the back of my head and I look up and I  thought,    What in the world?    And I hear this official going,    Hey guys,  guys, guys.    And it was Bryan Bosworth and Tony Casillas and two  other team captains that were getting ready to go out on the field. They  were walking down the sidelines to the middle of the field. Well, what I  had done had ticked him off, and I   m very prideful about it now. But the  week before, Bosworth had worn   had athletic tape on his shoes and  had written    Mike Gundy    and it was the week before they played OSU.  As if,    Hey I   m looking forward to the OSU game. I   m not even  thinking about the game this week.    So I had taken some athletic tape  and had written across my boots    Bryan Bosworth    and of course, I   m  kneeled down. And I guess I don   t know if he saw it or he was just being  Bosworth. But he   they hit me in the back of the head and this official  stops them. And I   m kind of just in shock. It didn   t really hurt that much,  just kind of surprised me.  But then later in the game, I kind of got them back. I had taken some  athletic tape and I had made this this   out of an old table cloth, I had  made this big OU flag. So I   m waving it in front of our fans and of  course the OSU fans are going,    Boo       The OU fans are starting to  kind of cheer. So I pull out the shotgun and I drape it over the end of the  Shotgun. And I go  shooting sounds  and I shoot two holes in it  (Laughs). Of course that Sunday morning, as I mentioned earlier, that  Sunday morning on the front page of the Daily Oklahoman there   s Pete  and it says,    Pete and his weeping towel.    But actually I was offended  by a bad call, and I guess they caught that. That was one of those  memorable series of events. Some things just kind of stick out in your  mind.  What, you know you described to me and part of the   you told me  14  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  earlier about the boots wearing out cause you acted bowlegged like the  Pete. What Frank Eaton   s bow legged, the swagger factor? Or some of  those things?  Yeah there   s a little walk. I think every Pete kind of trademarks a little  bit of a different drawl or walk. Yeah, you try to do that everywhere you  go, because you   re in character.  Scott, one thing that I   ve heard mention is that Pistol Pete as a mascot is  really different than a lot of the other mascots at other school. What   s  different about Pete that the Baylor Bear doesn   t have?  Well you can   t jump around. You can   t do flips. Although some of us  have tried to do creative things in the past   over the past 50 years, I  think you   re limited. You know when you have 40 pounds of plexi-fiber  glass on your head your kind of limited, so you can   t run very easily.  You can run, but you can   t run very easily. You   ve got the gun, and it   s  strapped down with a snap. It   s a real 357 luger gun, you know, pistol.  And we   re one of the only mascots that carry a real gun with live blanks  that shoot fire out of the end of the gun. We have gun safety. Going  through some of my stuff, I found some gun safety that I had to go  through with the OSU Police Department.  Scott, just to interject for a minute. Now, at home events, we always had  the   sometimes being at visiting venues or NCAA playoffs, there   s some  restrictions on being able to have     Oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. In fact, it typically is in the NCAA  tournaments. Usually at bowl games you can still use the guns. A lot of  the away locations will not allow you to. But you   re right some of the  mascots can do some things that Pete can   t. You can   t dive and roll.  Some of the mascots will run across the basketball court and dive and  slide and Pete can   t do that.  But I remember one time I got into a tiff with the San Diego Chicken at  Kansas. They had, I guess, I don   t know if the Royals had played the  San Diego Padres. But they had brought in the San Diego Chicken to the  KU football game. And he   s out there and he   s with the KU Jayhawk  and we meet before the game and we   re kind of talking. And this guy,  that   s the professional mascot for the San Diego Padres, he   s asking me  for my gun. You know, mascots talking to each other. We   re out on the  field nobody else can hear us. And he goes,    Hey give me your gun.     And I   m like,    I   m not going to give you my gun.    That   s one of those  rules. Pete does not give up his gun to anyone except a law enforcement  officer or someone that has the authority to request it. So we   re talking  and he   s like,    Hey give me   just give me your gun.     15  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Well, the fans over on the OSU side had started seeing this kind of play  and they start chanting    Shoot the bird    Shoot the bird       I mean, I  don   t know if   I don   t think the cheerleaders started it. I don   t know  where it came from. We don   t point the gun at any other mascot. We  might point it at the general direction if they   re way far away, but  you   ve got to be aware. Because, like I said, it will shoot and fire out of  the barrel that far. So we kind of start pacing off. He realizes I   m not  going to give it and after a little bit of his cursing at me for not giving  him the gun. You know, it kind of irritated me. And I thought,    Okay,  I   m going to shoot the bird.    So he gets about 25, 30 yards away from  me, And I    bang, bang, bang    you know and of course the crowd loved  that. But those little experiences like that are just very memorable.  Now also, is there any other mascot that you can think of that   s actually  based on an historic person. I mean, you know a person who   s been     I   m sure there is, and of course then there   s some schools who can   t be  creative enough to get their own so they come and take Pistol Pete  (Laughs). But you know, I don   t know. I haven   t done enough mascot  research. I   m sure there is. Like the Rebel   I   m sure he represents  someone whether it   s from the Running Rebels from Nevada, UNLV or  the Ole Miss mascot. So I   m sure that there are. I don   t know of any that  have quite the history and the tradition or else I think we would have  heard more about them.  Follow up question, how does Pistol Pete being the mascot symbolize  Oklahoma State University and our fans? What are the connections?  How does he represent Oklahoma State and the state of Oklahoma in his  character?  How does he represent the state of Oklahoma and our fans? Well you  know, I think knowing a little more about our history and how we got  our colors from Princeton and then how that kind of translates into Pistol  Pete and the Oklahoma State colors as we know them today.  Well I just understood the fact that as a western state, you know one of  the last ones. You know the Hanging Judge Isaac Parker   that Pete shot  dead what? Eleven guys? Several of them had shot his dad and just the  wild west motif. Do you feel that in that sense, the state of Oklahoma,  and Oklahoma State as a land grant institution that kind of    Find some  of those    And maybe you   ve never thought about that.  Well, I have. I have thought about the guys that Frank shot to avenge his  father   s death and probably not everybody knows that story. But  absolutely I think that as a land grant institution I think you just  characterized it very well for us. I think without question that the history  16  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  that Frank Eaton and the mascot can portray for the future. It should  forever tie us back to our roots and it does. It has a flare of the Ole    Wild  West.  It is a little unique in that sense.  Absolutely.  Well, you talked about shooting the chicken (Laughter). I loved that  story but know I   ve got to ask the flip side. Turn the prism. What   s your  most embarrassing moment as Pete? Can you remember one that you  would share?  I do remember one. And I don   t know that it   s my embarrassing     actually I have a couple. (Laughs)  Share them with us.  Well, I remember one time it was really hot. I don   t even remember  what game it was but it was a home game. It was a home football game  and I remember it was right after a big play and I probably   I never had  heat stroke but you had to consume a lot of water during the game to  keep hydrated because you sweat a ton. And, I mean it   s hot in that head  you know and the long sleeves and it   s hotter on the field. But I  remember something big happened and I cocked the gun and then I spun  it and when I spun it, it shot. It went off. It didn   t hit me, it hit me kind  of in the chaps. But I remember thinking,    Oh my gosh that was stupid. I  hope nobody saw that.    (Laughs) And I really don   t think many people  did. I mean there   s always some eyes on Pete somewhere but that was  embarrassing.  Another time I was in a parade and I was in this cool convertible in  Ardmore and toward the end of the parade I had to sit back down  because we were going. It was the end we had gone off the parade route  and I sat back down in the seat and the hammer of my gun caught the  interior of this guy   s leather and just ripped it and I felt so bad. And I  told him about it and I said,    We   ll pay for it.    I apologized. I felt  horrible about that. And he was so proud to have Pistol Pete in his car in  this parade in Ardmore. I   ll never forget that night. I wish I knew who  the guy was and I would still apologize today.  But not just embarrassing ones, any other special memorable moments  that you would recall that were special to you?  You know, I   ve given you a few. I think some of those like this   the  reading program that I did where I actually took the head off and I read a  17  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  story about Pistol Pete to the kids and they asked some great questions. I  got a little note from them and I think I   ve got it here and it said   it   s  kind of funny because it was right around Christmas.   Reads from letter     December 3, 1985. Dear Scott, thank you for  coming to our school and being Pistol Pete. The OSU fans in our class  really liked you. (Laughs) We all thank you for coming.     I guess that was his way of saying I   m not an OSU fan, but the fans that  were there really liked you. But anyway, they put this on a little stocking  and they all signed it. It   s things like this that you know now that I have  my own children I realize how impactful having a speaker like that is.  Because they   ve had Olympic champions and people come and speak at  their school and as insignificant Pistol Pete may be on that stage, it   s  significant to those kids.  Pistol Pete as a person but a symbol is a different thing.  Absolutely.  Like the guy who   s Mickey Mouse.  Yeah. But it   s very rewarding to represent Oklahoma State in that  fashion and to be able to touch kids    lives in a small way like that  Any other stories   you keep alluding, Scott, to children and any of us  that observes Pete knows there   s two routes. One, kids might be scared  of this guy but for a lot of them it   s like a magnet. Can you recall some  of your experiences with kids?  There are so many times when and usually, I   d say 95 percent of the  time, people love seeing Pete. A lot of the times parents will be a ways  away and the kid is like,    I want to see Pete, I want to go see Pete.    And  then they get up close and it   s like    Whoa  I don   t want to see Pete.    But  those experiences with children, a lot of the times you   d stumble into  them because you just don   t see them very well. With the big head your  vision is limited from here down and they can be standing right in front  of you and you just don   t see them so you got really experienced in  going    Okay, I   m clear, clear.    (Laughter) Kind of like having a back up  camera in a car these days so you can see what   s behind you. There were  times when I would stumble over children or trip over a camera man at a  football game cause he comes and sits down beside me and I don   t know  it. When I turn to walk off and we both fall down but those kinds of  things are memorable and fun. But you bet, I think when you have your  own children you start realizing just how impactful those things are to  kids. And I think it   s impactful that Pete, you just don   t realize it at the  18  Gill  Petty  time.  I   ll tell you a final story. In 1986, my first away game was against the  University of Southwestern Louisiana, which is now the University of  Louisiana, Lafayette. Joe DeForest, who   s a friend and a coach here  now, played in that game and they were beating us  DeForest played for  Lafayette . We came back and won that game. And I   m not going to say  that that final play was against Joe but I think the very end we caught a  touchdown pass, Meachum or somebody. But anyway we ended up  winning that game. At that game, I didn   t know this until literally 19, 18  years later this kid is in a Pistol Pete interview. His name   s Jared Wiley  and he says,    Well, I remember meeting Pistol Pete for the first time  when I was three years old. I was at the football game in Louisiana in  Lafayette.    And I look down at his birth date and I thought,       83,    86?  That was me  I was Pete at that game.    And he became Pistol Pete and  he was by far one of the best in that crowd that day that was trying out  for Pete. But you don   t think you have an impact on kids. And that was  so rewarding for me. And he has a picture of us which I   ve seen, and I  need to get a copy of it because that   s just so cool that he then went  forward and I think a lot of Petes probably met Pete at an early age and  they thought wow that   s cool, that   s awesome. And, of course, their  parents or grandparents inspire them. But that was a neat deal for Jared  to be Pistol Pete in 2003 and 2004 and I think he went on to be All-  American too.  Did you feel a special sense of responsibility when you put on that  uniform and that hat and went out in public?  Oh, absolutely. I absolutely did. Dave Martin did a great job and still  does today of connecting with all those guys, with the Petes, with the  cheerleaders and the poms. And the way he and Toni live their lives, I  think really motivate and give those Petes and those cheerleaders  something to shoot for and the bar is raised. You know,    Hey I   m  representing Oklahoma State and there   s an awesome responsibility  there.    It comes down from there.  Althea Wright was our Spirit Group sponsor and I remember going to  the cheerleading camp at SMU for the first time and she went with us. I  thought wow here   s this retired women that is so prideful about  Oklahoma State and she was a cheerleader in the    50s I believe. And I  saw her the other night at the Spirit Group reunion about a month ago.  Dave still puts on these Spirit Group reunions and pulls everybody  together. We have a golf tournament and casino night. And you know  it   s obvious he   s passionate about what he does. I think you   ll find that  anybody who is Pistol Pete is passionate about being Pete. But that  comes from the top down and I think our administration does a great job  19  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  of expecting that and inspiring that in our Spirit Group.  You   ve kind of told me a little bit about what being Pistol Pete meant to  you then. What does it mean to you now? Looking back how many  years? About 20     Yeah, 23   very rewarding. You know it   s like another life. It   s  probably like you feel about playing football at Oklahoma State. It  seems like it was another life. And it was in a sense. But it   s an awesome  feeling. It   s cool for people to    And now that I don   t work for  Oklahoma State and I did for 15 years as you know, I   m not introduced  as often as a former Pistol Pete. But you know, old friends that introduce  me to somebody they   ll introduce me that way. And that   s very cool. It   s  kind of like being a former governor, I guess. It   s just, you   re proud.  You   re proud of being able to represent your school that way. I don   t  know, I guess today I look back on it and I think my kids think it   s very  cool. I hope they come to Oklahoma State. But living here in Stillwater I  know that the chances that they want to go somewhere else may be  pretty strong. I know I look on it very fondly. I   m proud of the fact that I  was able to represent Oklahoma State. It   s been a very neat thing to raise  a family here and be able to expose them to OSU culture and athletic  events.  What do your friends or say people who don   t know you quite as well,  what   s there reaction typically when they find out you   re a former Pete?  You know sometimes they say,    I can see that, I can see that.    Or they  say,    Really? Wow  That   s amazing. I never knew that.    You kind of get  the reaction of either they thought,    You don   t know me that well then.     (Laughs) But you get kind of the whole gambit. You get the whole  spectrum.  Scott, are there sort of lessons, maybe disciplines, that you learned from  your Pete experience that you   ve carried over in the rest of your life?  You talked about time management earlier in the conversation, but other  things that shaped your life?  I think without a question the time management piece is big. Doing  things right and trying to always be better and improve. You know I had  a lunch with somebody the other day that said,    What are you doing to  sharpen your blade? What are you doing to be better in your job?    We  just had brought in a speaker to speak to my group in my company and  it   s refreshing and revitalizing to hear certain aspects that you need to  have those things as time goes on in your career. You need to have those  motivators, but you also have to be passionate about what you do. And I  think that   s one of the things that Pete taught me about is being  20  Gill  Petty  Gill  Petty  Gill  passionate and, hey, if I   m not passionate about it, I   m not going to be  able to do it. I have to believe in what I   m doing and what I   m  representing. Life   s too short to not be passionate. And I think Pete  taught me passion, without question.  Scott, what would you tell an OSU student or a younger person who is  thinking about being Pete?  I would tell them that you   ve got to make sure you want to do it. We   ve  had guys that have done it and then they   ve come back for the second  tryout to do it the next year and they   ve said things like,    Yeah, well I  got kind of tired, but I really want to do it again.    Hey, you   re going to  get tired when you   re Pete. But you better not state in the interview that  you may not want to do it again. You know that there have been times  when you thought,    Ah I don   t know if I really want to do it again.    If  that   s in the back of your mind, you better not verbalize it. Because we  want somebody that   s committed; that   s driven; that   s passionate; that   s  optimistic and outgoing; that has the attitude,    I   m here representing  Oklahoma State.     I think if somebody   s going to tryout for Pete, we have a little clinic the  week or so before so they can put the head on   that   s kind of like what  Rick had done for me. And we had it back then too. You put the head  on, you see yourself in front of the mirror over at the Colvin Center. You  kind of get the sense of what you look like and what other guys look like  get ideas on the walk and different things. But yeah, you know you   ve  got to want to do it. And it   s hard work. I mean you   re sweating and  there   s early morning drives to schools and late night return trips home  and you know what   it   s all worth. I mean it if you love it and your  passionate about it. I think sometimes you just don   t know, but you  better read up and study up and make sure that you really want to do it.  That   s what I   d tell someone if they were trying out.  Scott, you   ve probably already answered this question but would you do  it over again?  (Laughs) In a heartbeat. Yeah, in a heartbeat. And I would bet  especially   in fact, I think that after I was married I talked to Gerri  about going back and getting an advanced degree and,    I could try out  for Pete again and I probably know what they   re looking for.    She said,     You don   t have the energy, you couldn   t do it.    No, but I would do it  again in a heartbeat and I think most Petes would say that because it is  so rewarding to represent the school this way.  Scott, passion is a word you   ve used several times, and I believe that.  But is there anything that additionally we didn   t talk about that you  21  Petty  Gill  didn   t get the chance to share with us. Any comments that you   d like to  make that we haven   t ask a question about that is important we ought to  cover.  You know Pete sometimes is kind of forgotten because there   s a Spirit  Squad. I   ll never forget the Gator Bowl which is a great example of that.  Rick and I went to the Gator Bowl   the second one in    85 when we  played Florida State. You know it   s my first bowl game. It was his  second because he had gone when we had played the Gamecocks the  year before, South Carolina. I realized it and of course you know I   m  only 6, 8 months into being Pistol Pete when we went to this Gator Bowl  and I realized when Pete was signing autographs I mean the games over,  people are leaving, stadiums almost empty and Rick and I are packing  up taking his chaps off, put them away, because I am pretty much his  keeper when we   re on the road at some games. Pete doesn   t always have  that, usually its cheerleaders. But in this situation he and I were packing  up and we start heading out and we head out of the stadium and we get  to where the vans are, and there not there. And there   s a long line of  cars. This is before cell phones Jerry, and there   s a long line of cars and  there   s three vans and the cheerleaders, the poms, and the advisors are  gone. There going away from us. (Laughs) And Rick and I   he   s got the  head and I   ve got the bag   I mean we were, we go trucking across the  parking lot. They still haven   t even missed us yet. So, Pete sometimes is  the forgotten representative of Oklahoma State and you know, there is  only one of us in an appearance type of setting with a Spirit Group, but I  guess they just thought,    You know, he   s in there somewhere.    (Laughs)  Great story.  -------  -------
