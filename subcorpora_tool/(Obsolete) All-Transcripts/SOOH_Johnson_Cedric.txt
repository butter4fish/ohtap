 Finchum and I   m a librarian at Oklahoma State  University Library. Today is September 3, 2009. We   re at the Muskogee  Public Library in Muskogee, Oklahoma interviewing Cedric Johnson.  This interview is being conducted as part of the Muskogee African  American Heritage Oral History Project which is part of the  Spotlighting Oklahoma series. Thank you for joining us today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little bit about your hometown, where  you were born.  My hometown, which is virtually a ghost town at this point, was  Clarksville, Oklahoma, and that is in Wagoner County, perhaps in the  southwest corner of Wagoner County, right off Highway 51B, about  eight miles south of Porter, but it no longer exists. My grandparents, my  mother   s parents, settled there before statehood. They were allottees  from the Creek Nation, so they had quite a bit of land holdings in what  we referred to sometimes as the Arkansas Valley. It was all a big family  conglomerate that included the school. My mother   s aunt, which would  be my Great-Aunt, Mary, said that was no place for us black kids     negroes as we were called at that time   to go to school. So she made an  arrangement with Wagoner County to form a school board and to  construct a school on about two acres in one corner of her allotment. The  Board hired the teachers and what have you. My first teacher happened  to live with us, so I got lessons at school and I got lessons at home. Most  of the people going to that school were family members or  sharecroppers    kids or what have you, connected with the family. That  was back in the old days.  How many children were attending this school?  5  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  I   m going to say that you probably could have gotten about 100 kids in  the school at that time because there was no other place for a black kid  to go to school in about maybe 15 or 20 miles of that. There was finally  a school established in Clarksville, but we lived closer to the Arkansas  Valley School, that   s what we called it. My first teacher was named  Ruby Donnelly. I got to visit with her, she was aging, in Minneapolis  about 20 years ago. She found me. Kept looking until she found me.  (Laughs)  So let   s back up just a little bit. Do you mind telling us what year you  were born?  1932. May 13, 1932.  So you would have been going to first grade towards the tail end of the  Depression?  Yes. Say, maybe    38, somewhere in there      37, 38.  What did your family farm? What was their product?  Cotton. And corn was the big thing at that time because you could use  the corn to feed the livestock as well as the humans, so you had a dual  thing here. Then my daddy grew a good acreage of cotton. You know,  you   ve got to plow this cotton, you   ve got to plant this cotton, by mule  team. So he   s up at dawn, if not before, going to the fields because he  was perhaps farming in excess of 80 acres, maybe right around 100  acres. And he would hire people to pick cotton. We had people to walk  from Muskogee to his farm and that had to be a 14-mile round trip and  they were walking out there to pick his cotton because he had good  cotton. When I say    good cotton,    you hear of corn being high as an  elephant   s eye by the Fourth of July. His cotton got up there, too, and  some of those folks would pick a bale of cotton a day. That   s worth 500  pounds.  He could leave there taking a shortcut through what we call the bottoms  and around Jack Anderson Mountain with a mule team pulling the  wagon of a load of cotton. He would come to Muskogee and bring some  oats or corn or grain for his mules because he   s coming in at about 4  o   clock in the evening and he   s going to stay overnight and sleep on the  cotton on the way in order to be in line in time, early, to get his cotton  unloaded and registered and then come back. And sometimes by the  time he got back to the farm site, there would be another wagon load on  the ground. They didn   t have no other place to put it, so you just emptied  your 12 foot sack on the ground. I despise picking cotton. Won   t do it  today or ever again. Didn   t do much of it at that time because basically I  6  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  was too young. I left there in about the second or third grade and came  to Muskogee.  How long did he continue to do it?  He didn   t. That was the time that he left. He was farming my aunt   s  allotment and see this aunt at one time, she and her son were probably  worth about at least a half a million dollars, if not more, because they  had several farms and ranches and oil. So, he farmed that and then I  guess around    38 or    39 he couldn   t buy anything so they decided to  move to Tulsa. My brother and sister stayed on the farm with my  mother   s mother, my grandmother, our grandmother. I came to  Muskogee and lived with my father   s parents, Grandpa and Grandma,  and started school at Jerusalem.  What did that set of grandparents do for their living?  He did farm labor but they also had a regular government income. I  think my grandmother had perhaps lost her brother in WWI and he had  her listed as his beneficiary, so she was getting a tiny, small, little check  from him. They bought two acres on Shawnee Bypass and basically  that   s where I grew up. I went from Jerusalem to Wheatley School and  then from Wheatley to Manual, seventh through twelfth grades at  Manual Training High School   historically   Manual Training High  School.  They probably didn   t have busses. Did you walk?  You walked and walking was fun because you had a crowd and we  walked. Now on rainy days like today, you could catch a bus for a  nickel, if you had a nickel, and you got off the bus right at the school  site, but that seldom happened unless the weather was real bad. It is  more fun walking in a group.  About how far would that be for your walk?  Say from 24th street to 4th street   20 blocks. If you take a mile as being  12, it was a nice little walk. We didn   t mind.  Thirty minutes or so?  Yeah. We didn   t mind because there was a group of us. We just took our  time and strolled on to school, strolled back from school and it was the  thing to do with your friends.  Where had that set of grandparents come from?  7  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  From Ladonia, Texas. Black young men outside of Oklahoma were  raring to get to Oklahoma and maybe they could find a Freedmen  woman with land and with money. So they were encouraged to come to  Oklahoma. I think my dad came to Oklahoma maybe around   it was  early nineteen-something, maybe right after statehood which was 1907.  1911, maybe somewhere around there because my mother was born in  1911 and my dad was probably six or seven years older than her. She did  not receive an allotment directly because she was too young. She was  born after the cutoff date. Now she did inherit some property from  relatives that was passed down and is still being passed down. Now  some of my relatives are on their original allotment.  They still have it?  Yeah. My cousins are still there. Matter of fact, I was born on the site  where one of my relatives now lives and farms and is doing quite well.  But I was born right there on that site, before he was born. (Laughs)  That   s great that it   s still in the family.  It   s still in the family and it   s still being used.  As a farm?  Now my philosophy is if you just got land or property and it   s not  generating any income, well what good is it? To say,    That   s still mine.  Well, it doesn   t produce anything.    You need to let somebody else have  it who will produce something. And of course, so much of your farm  land now is being covered with cement, building big old mansions  nobody really needs, but they want. That   s about it.  So you had two siblings? A brother and a sister?  A brother and a sister. My sister is deceased. My brother still lives in  Muskogee.  Did they go to Manual with you?  Yes. They were at Manual Training High School. I   m four years older  than my brother and six years older than my sister, so by the time they  got out of high school, I was out and gone.  You graduated in    50        51 and started Lincoln Junior College in Kansas City, Missouri in  September 1951.  8  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  What took you there?  Relatives.  Not a subject in particular?  No, just relatives because I had never heard of it. And my mother   s  sisters and   by this time, you have black people abandoning the farm. I  guess everybody was abandoning farms because the war had been over  about five years and many of those folks had gone to work in some  defense capacity or the other. They never came back to Oklahoma and  they worked in packing houses in Kansas City and all of those areas. So  I went there and one of my relatives got me a job where he was working  at a bakery. I could work there and attend classes during the day, but I  also couldn   t stay off 18th and Vine and that created a problem. (Laughs)  And what was that?  That was the swinging jazz district. The most famous district   perhaps,  one of the most famous in the nation. 18th and Vine in Kansas City,  Missouri and it   s a Jazz Museum, Negro Baseball Hall of Fame is there  at this point. So it is still quite historical. It was the place to be and the  place to be seen. So I   m young and the bright lights can go to your head  in a hurry (laughs) and get you in trouble. So, I had to leave there in     53   didn   t have to, but you had to keep a certain grade point average. I  didn   t keep the grade point average; got drafted. Which wasn   t bad.  And went where?  Went to Great Britain for about a year and a half, in which I seriously  thought about staying, taking a British citizenship because for the first  time, as a black person, you got some freedom. You   re totally free.  Historically, the British didn   t judge you by color. Now they might  judge you by economic status, whether you were royalty and that kind of  stuff. They had kind of a caste system which they will deny, but they  have a caste system and that was fun. Absolutely fun. Say in a pub,  visiting with a British person and historically, they knew what they were  talking about. This one gentleman, I remember this statement, he says,     What you chaps in the colonies don   t understand,      the colony, he was  still saying America is a colony and I thought that was quite funny. But I  guess he knew what he was talking about.  So you stayed in the service four years?  No, two. Then back to Muskogee and back to Northeastern State  University. The grade point average didn   t drop this time. Then to TU,  9  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Tulsa University, and here I am.  Well let   s go back to Muskogee in the early days. Can you describe your  neighborhood a little bit?  Well, actually we lived just on the edge of the city limits on two acres  and somebody else over here will have two or three or whatever. So now  you   ve got to come into the inner city   we called it the inner city   to go  to school. And of course, Muskogee had a black district of businessmen.  Muskogee was kind of different perhaps from any other place in  America as far as black people were concerned because they were  economically sufficient. You probably had more millionaires per  thousand in Muskogee than you had anywhere else in the United States  and that was due to the connection with the tribes and oil. I knew several  of them who were quite wealthy from oil. Then there were with others  who were quite wealthy from other things.  I knew, personally knew, about five doctors in Muskogee of African  descent. I knew about five attorneys of African descent and a large  number of teachers. These folks were well educated and so that made  Muskogee a bit of a different place. You had businesses that were totally  operated by black people. You had tailor shops, you had a department  store, T.J. Elliot   s and as I said, you had the other professions. You had  grocery stores, a number of grocery stores   not just one, a number of  grocery stores. There was a hotel and a restaurant that was African  American owned and was a popular spot to have dinner or lunch and that  kind of stuff. And there were several restaurants all on 2nd Street and, of  course, there were recreational parlors as we call them, pool halls.  (Laughs)  A movie theater?  Yeah, a movie theater and various other things. But your life, more or  less, revolved around the school. The church happened to be the  gathering place for black people and you   d be surprised how people  could divide themselves according to education and according to  income, economic division within the races. It didn   t create any  problems, but there were some churches where the elite attended and  then there were some where the rest of us went. (Laughs) But this was  quite a place to grow up in at that time.  So your closest neighbor would have been two miles away?  It probably would have been an acre between us, as far as a neighbor on  each side. Could have very well been about an acre difference, but we  set right in the middle of two acres. And then there were others down  10  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  and away from east and west of us.  What did you do for fun in your youth? Like 14 or 15, around that age.  Now we still had connections with those relatives in the country. So I   m  living with my grandparents and when my parents came down, we  would go visit those relatives in the country   maybe on a Friday night.  We   d spend a weekend there. Now you   ve got horses and you   ve got  fishing and you   ve got swimming in the creek, you know, going skinny  dipping in the creek. And why we weren   t bitten or eaten up by  Cottonmouth Water Moccasins, somebody up there likes us. (Laughter)  So we did that for awhile and you know, when you get in high school  you start developing other things, ballgames, socials we   d call them,  dances, that kind of stuff.  And then there were house parties. In those days you could give a house  party   the parents could or somebody could give a party for the youth  and there wouldn   t be any violence as there is today. So we did that, we  played cards, we played Whist and just socialized. We had a hang out on  Second Street called the Bright Spot that was the teenage hang out.  There was sodas   I called it   sodas and ice cream and hamburgers and  that type of stuff. We would go to a movie and after the movie we would  hang out there. The bus is going to leave town at 11 o   clock; that   s the  last bus, so you best be on that bus unless you had a girlfriend that you  wanted to walk home, take the slow route home and you   d do that.  Voice of experience here?  (Laughs) No comment.  So your family kind of split up at that point. Any particular reason why?  Well, my dad was working in, I think that was, Adams and Leonard  Apartment. They had an apartment on site, but it was too small for kids.  So we would visit there and maybe stay a few days and then come back.  Now, as my grandfather passed   well after the war, after December 7,  the war was declared. Then my daddy came back to Muskogee and of  course, the family was back together. He came back to Muskogee and I  think his first defense job was in Pryor at an ammo plant in Pryor then at  Camp Gruber when Camp Gruber was in its heyday. And after Camp  Gruber closed, the war was over and we moved to California for a year  seeking employment. So I did a year at Carver Junior High School in  Los Angeles which I just visited there this summer again.  Had it changed much?  11  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Not much, no. The population has changed. When I was there you had a  little United Nations as I called it. You had black kids, Japanese kids  were returning, parents were returning from the concentration camps  that they were put in during World War II. They were returning to Los  Angeles. You had Jewish people. You had a mixture of races. Well, now  the school is predominantly Hispanic and black and low income and  that   s the way Los Angeles has changed. Some Asians also. That   s the  way it has changed.  How has Muskogee changed from those days?  Basically Muskogee had lost population and a lot of cultural things have  been lost. Adam Clayton Powell, Hazel Scott, Etta Moten were all  frequent visitors to Muskogee in some capacity. I can remember the first  time I met Adam Clayton Powell. He gave a speech at what we call the  City Hall. That was before we got the Civic Center. He was an amazing  person. He was smart and he could hold your attention with a speech,  basically telling us where we are and where we were going. Those were  the days of strict racism. He was from New York and his wife also put  on a concert here, her name was Hazel Scott. She was a noted pianist so  she had to do Muskogee. Actually, if you didn   t do Muskogee back in  those days then you didn   t do it. Count Basie, B.B. King, you name  them, they were here in Muskogee. Aaron Bell. Of course, Aaron Bale  was a native Muskogeean. He taught jazz, just before he passed a couple  years ago, in New York. He taught jazz at, I believe, NYU after being  the Manual Training High School band director. He went back on the  road with the Aaron Bell Trio. And so you had a number of folks   Bill  Dogget comes to Muskogee.  They have the Jazz Festival here, too, don   t they?  They have the Music Hall of Fame here. So you don   t have that high  economic thing in Muskogee anymore. You don   t have the black  businesses anymore.  Are there any left?  Yeah, there are some left. Ragsdale Mortuary was historically one of the  oldest in this part of the country and Ted, Jr. is still operating that one.  You had Ragsdale Mortuary. You had Holmes and you had People   s and  Granger   s. Ragsdale and Granger   s, they are still operating. People   s is  no longer operating, however, the facility is being used. It   s not  People   s, it   s Keith Biglow now. So those are still in business.  What type of business was People   s?  12  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  A mortuary, and it   s still there. And of course you had Brice Grocery.  Basically we had very few heirs to pass it on. For some reason or  another, black business people and teachers in those days, they didn   t  have big families and those that did wouldn   t care to go into that  business. Ted Ragsdale did, his grandfather started that. He is still doing  it. He went into the business after his father passed, he took over and he  is running the show, but now your grocery stores   chain stores began to  move in like Safeway. That kind of knocked the mom and pop stores  out. However, if you   d had the foresight where all your grocery owners  would have formed a corporation, then they probably could have run a  business just as well as Safeway or just as well as we have now in  Muskogee, Homeland. They could have easily done that, but again you  have got to have that foresight. They had the ability. Their problem  would have been funding because you have to have access to funding.  Most businesses operate on somebody else   s funds. (Laughs) Would the  bank have loaned them the money? I doubt it. So that would have been a  problem.  Were there any black owned banks?  Way back there was a black owned bank in Muskogee and then after  that, like I said, funding would have been a problem   a big problem.  But they just didn   t go far enough down the road. They did see to it that  their kids become educated   not necessarily following them, but they  did stress education. In Muskogee in the black neighborhood, the  teachers knew what the parents expected. The students knew what the  parents expected.    You   re going to get an education.    The emphasis was  on education. Muskogee Manual has produced at least four college  presidents. Dr. Adam Herbert most recently, the University of Indiana  was president there. And then a young lady named Norma Kimble was  president of a junior college in Oakland, California. And John Williams  was President of Maryland State. Those three   I don   t remember the  fourth person but there was a fourth person. And of course, any number  of doctors and lawyers that are practicing today are Manual Training  graduates.  We didn   t know what a good thing we had until it was gone and we  began to go to other places. Hey, we had a better deal over here. Now,  you   re talking about an education and the Supreme Court    54 decision,  saying that    separate, but not equal anymore.    Well basically they were  right because we were operating on less money than our counterpart  across town, but we had astute and dedicated teachers. Now, these  teachers were better educated than perhaps any other teachers in the  state, your black teachers were. Now that came about because of racism.  Black people, up until    54, could only go to Langston University and get  a bachelor   s degree. You can   t go to OSU or OU to get a master   s  13  Finchum  Johnson  degree. Now the state is going to pay your out-of-state fees if you go to  USC because they don   t want you in class. So our teachers went to USC  and got their master   s degrees. Or they   d go back to New York,  Columbia University, and get their master   s degrees, PhDs. They would  go to Wichita State, KU or some of those schools and these were the top  of the black brain pool because you can   t do anything else.  You   re either going to be a teacher and if you have the funds to go to  med school, or you   re going to be a preacher. So, all of this was at the  top of the brain pool and we didn   t think about that at that time. All we  knew was these people were smart and they knew. We had one teacher, I  guess she spoke about four different languages, but she was teaching  Spanish and Latin. I took Latin and then those are the kind of teachers  that we had. They were no Tom Foolery. They would be your best  friend, but they had sole responsibility of teaching you subject matter  and decorum and anything else they wanted to teach you and you didn   t  want to get on their bad side.  Now those teachers were very cultural, so they tried to give us this  cultural stuff. I remember my English teacher, actually she was not my  English teacher, but I knew her and she gave a TV party. The first TV I  actually saw was at her house and the TV station was not on 24 hours  like they are now. Channel 8 was in Muskogee and it was on mostly in  the afternoon and it didn   t broadcast very long. So she had us at her  house for what she called a Coke TV party. That   s the first time I saw a  TV. Those were the kind of teachers that we had. We thought everybody  had teachers like that but that wasn   t the case. These were just  outstanding people.  And most of them had been graduates of Manual, too?  Yeah, a large part of them were graduates of Manual. But they had left  Muskogee. Their life didn   t end in Muskogee city limits. They went  outside and chose to come back. Well now, there   s no reason for a  youngster to come back. My two kids won   t necessarily come back to  stay. My daughter is a graduate of OU and my son OSU and he is a  senior artist and production for Wal-Mart company at the headquarters  and my daughter is in the medical field. But if they came back here,  what would they do? Not many opportunities. I have a niece who is an  attorney in Memphis, Tennessee. She is not a Manual grad. None of my  nieces or nephews graduated from Manual. They graduated from  Muskogee High.  You can get a good education in Muskogee now if you want it, but the  neighborhood is so much different. Muskogee is just, right now we  could classify it as economically depressed. Especially when you can  14  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  say 75 percent of our kids are on free or reduced lunch. So that means  you   re economically depressed. I don   t know what the future is going to  hold there. But back in the old days, we were not economically  depressed and when I say old days I mean when I left Muskogee in    51.  I was gone basically four years before I came back and had not intended  to stay except the Superintendent of Schools offered me a teaching spot  and I took it because I didn   t have   maybe I had bus fare to L.A. and  my relatives were inviting me to come back to L.A. At that time I   m  single and I can go. Then I decided to stay and get a master   s degree and  in between that time I was married and had a kid and still went to L.A.  for that summer with the intention of possibly staying, exploring the job  market, which looked good. When I was due at an interview, I was back  in Albuquerque coming back to Muskogee and I have no regrets of  staying in Muskogee and making a career. I stayed in the school system  38 years.  And taught what subjects?  I taught remedial math and I taught all of the social studies, including  economics. And it   s ironic now. We had the last course of economics at  Manual Training High School, as an elective. I taught that. The kids got  an idea about the monetary system and how we worked economically.  Now the state is mandating that kids get something of that sort. We  already had it at Manual. I enjoyed teaching it. I enjoyed the kids. It was  not like teacher relationships. We were not actually buddy buddy, but we  could sit down and figure things out and my class was full. (Laughs)  So were you teaching there when they integrated?  Yes.  And did you move over to     Right, in 1970 I went to Muskogee High. I was chairman of the history  department at Manual and I was also chairman of the Eastern District  Social Studies Council of all the eastern district of Oklahoma. I went on  over to Muskogee High in September of 1970 teaching history. I stayed  there one semester and went into administration and became an assistant  principal the second semester of the    70-   71 school year and stayed in  that office from there on. Most of my time was spent in a principal   s  office and I always wanted to go back to the classroom because that   s  where the action is. You   re sitting there being a principal doing what?  My daughter said,    All you do is go out in the hall and direct traffic.     (Laughter) Of course there was more to it than that. I actually applied to  get back into the school system this semester and they turned me down,  which is alright.  15  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  They don   t know what they missed.  No, they don   t, but it   s alright. They really don   t.  Are there any particular memories from that change over time that you  want to talk about?  The change over time, we had some rough spots and we had some  potentially rough spots. There were racist people in Muskogee on both  sides of the fence who didn   t want this to happen. We could easily have  kept Manual open had the school board planned for that, but the school  board did not plan down the road. For example, Hilldale to the south of  us, they were a dependent district at that time. Their ninth graders came  to Muskogee. Now a fellow offered the Muskogee schools about 40  acres of land south of town if they would build a school out there, which  they refused to do. They left it up to the voters, so the voters could  choose that site or choose the site where it is now.  Well the most horrible site where it is now is the one that they chose.  When I say horrible, from access and what have you. Now had you built  down there, you could have drawn your lines. Hilldale probably would  not have done a high school so you could draw your lines and everybody  on that side of the line could go there. But that didn   t happen so you end  up basically with the one school and it had worked in spite of the  opposition. As I said earlier, you can get an education here. The big  thing that I   m holding Muskogee accountable for now, the school  system, is a lack of minority teachers. They don   t seem to really be  interested enough to go out and compete for minority teachers. Now  minority teachers are scarce, but Tulsa can find them. So I said,    Why  can   t Muskogee find them?     But by and large, this has been an interesting place to grow up. I  remember when all of the cafeterias and all of the restaurants were  segregated. The irony of those segregated days, Muskogee had a number  of people in the Tuskegee program, a number of flyers from Muskogee  and the Tuskegee because most of those guys were educated, those  pilots, so they were easily trained. Well one of the trainers was from  Muskogee named Nathan Sams. After the war, Nathan came back and  became manager of the Muskogee City Airport, Hatbox Field. Now he  and I were fraternity brothers, both Kappa Alpha Psi boys, and he taught  flying as well as management. So I would say virtually any white guy  who has a pilot   s license, especially at my age, you learned from the  black guy. Now, one of his students ran a restaurant. It   s ironic that he  could take flying lessons from Sam and learn to fly, but Sam couldn   t sit  at his lunch counter and have a sandwich.  16  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  So those were the days that we had, but we were so economically  independent in the black community that we didn   t really push for that  until later on into the    50s and    60s. All the utility companies     employees were all white, so Jake Simmons, who was heavy in the State  NAACP continued to push it and got those integrated. So now you have  black employees at the gas company, telephone company, electric  company and as a matter of fact, I think the OG E president is black.  So that   s how times have changed and we did so quietly in Muskogee.  Now, Oklahoma City had demonstrations, marches   Clara Luper did  organize that. We fed off of that. In other words, we could do this in  Muskogee if you guys don   t want to cooperate. So reluctantly, they did  and we didn   t have to go the demonstration route. That   s basically where  we are now, an economically depressed Muskogee with a lot of  potential, but very little action.  Are there very many farms still around or has the economic basis  changed?  Well there are still some fellows that are farming, but not nearly as many  as there once were. I mentioned this farm land. Now they   re building  McMansions, building big homes. People want to move out. And I can  see, in many cases when you have people leaving the inner city of a city,  Muskogee included, we call it    white flight.    Hilldale basically became  a neighborhood for    white flight.    And the school became a school  populated by    white flight.    And they say,    Well, we   re going to move  out here and get away from the crime, get away from the blacks.    I   m  right behind you and crime is right behind you also. So you can   t run. As  Joe Lewis says,    You can run, but you can   t hide.     There were various attempts to keep these areas all white. For example,  if you wanted to buy a home out there even if you had the money you  had a problem getting a mortgage or even selling them, too. I had a  friend wanting to buy a place or interested in buying a place in the  Hilldale district. So he calls a realtor. The realtor didn   t recognize him as  being black except when he got down there the place was suddenly sold.  So he asked one of his white acquaintances, I won   t say friend,  acquaintances to go check it out. So he went down as a potential buyer  and it was not sold. It was still on the market.  How far back was that?  That was perhaps somewhere in the    60s or maybe    70s because this  person hadn   t been back here much longer than I had. And so that was  not a long time ago in the stretch of time. Of course, that was before the  Fair Housing Acts were passed and so they could get away with that and  they wanted to sell the black people houses that white people had  17  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  abandoned in the inner city because a black person will pay a higher  price because this is probably better than what I have. And they could go  out here to some of the housing developments and they could get their  asking price from a white person out there because this person has got to  leave.  I was turned down for a loan assumption the day that I was to sign the  closing papers. The mortgage company didn   t know who I was because  the real estate person was handling this. So when I get there, they say,     Huh-uh. You can   t do this.    Now, everything was set up until I got  there to close, to sign the papers. So I called the realtor and said,    Hey,  they said they   re not going to do this.    And he said,    I   ll be there in five  minutes.    This is a white man and he got there in five minutes and he  said,    Give us the papers.    And I got the place. But without his  intervention, it wasn   t going to happen. So when I went to buy my  second one, the interest rates were suddenly jacked up so I had to go to  Tahlequah to get a decent interest rate. I got seven percent at Tahlequah  whereas the other ones wanted nine and ten. I don   t know whether that  was an attempt to gouge me or whether that was an attempt to  discourage me from buying property, but I got it. Still in it. Those are  some of the things black people had to go through in Muskogee. And  that wasn   t any different from anywhere else, either. But those are the  things that we did.  Back to the Manual Training High School and back to the black schools,  those teachers saw to it that you were going to read and you were going  to write and do what you   re supposed to do and you were going to  behave yourself. That was guaranteed.  They don   t tend to do that much today, do they?  No. When we integrated the schools, I found that the white teachers  basically had a different philosophy. They are teaching to a group of  people who are probably already motivated and the philosophy was     Here it is if you want it.    Whereas in a black school it was    Here it is.  You   re going to take it.    You don   t have any choice. They would come  to your house. They would talk to your parents. In other words, failure  was not an option. So that was a difference in philosophy and a  difference in teaching styles. And it worked out fine. These were well  educated people, well educated. Dr. Adams, PhD, Ohio State and others  might as well have been PhDs or master   s degrees from Wichita State  and K-State and KU and all those places.  Then you in turn had your master   s and did similar things with your  students?  18  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Yes. I tried to do them a little better, a little better.  Did you have a mentor? Someone you considered your mentor?  Probably several people were pushing me. The first principal I worked  under, E.H. Jennings, I was going to leave at the end of that year. He  said,    No, you can   t do this. I have some vouchers from NSU. I   ve got  three. Take these and that ought to pay your expenses through the  summer.    And it did. So now he   s pushing me to go into administration.  The first administrative job I applied for I didn   t get it. My cousin got it.  (Laughs) And that was alright, too. But he was one of those who were  pushing me, George Washington was pushing me. W.W. Cox, the  football coach, was pushing me. Everybody was shoving,    Why you  guys bugging me?    I had NSU professors and TU professors  encouraging me to go into a doctoral program. One of the Northeastern  professors said,    You go get a PhD and go south.    I   m saying,    For  what?    This is in the    60s. I      m going,    I   m not.    He was right. He was  positively right.  A TU professor was trying to get me an assistantship because he thought  I was already in the program, but actually I was just doing the  certification work. He thought I was already a PhD candidate and he  thought I was graduating in May. (Laughs) So I regret that I didn   t do  that because what I   m seeing now, I could do as well if not better than  some of the superintendents that I have worked under here in Muskogee.  Now the present one excluded, but the ones before him much better than  them. I can   t say hardly anything good about those guys. They made  poor decisions. They didn   t have anything to offer but a warm body, I  called them, occupied the chair. But they didn   t do anything to move the  district forward   nothing. And I could have done better than nothing.  It   s just a matter of preparing yourself to do that. And actually I really  wouldn   t need a PhD, but you know if you got a PhD people listen to  you whether you know much or not.  Sometimes.  They   re going to listen to you. (Laughs) That impresses people. But I  really couldn   t say enough about Manual Training High School and  about the black culture of Muskogee in the    30s and in the    40s and I  guess in the    20s, too. I wasn   t here in the    20s, I grew up basically in  the    40s. I guess I realized what was going on in the    40s, say from  1940, I remember the day the war broke out. We turned on the radio,  Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. Now where in the dickens is Pearl  Harbor? Never heard of Pearl Harbor, never heard of that. Well, we went  back to school   that was on a Sunday and we went back to school that  Monday. The teachers told us where Pearl Harbor was. So we all  19  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  pretended that we were in the military. I think I called myself Lieutenant  Cedric Johnson. (Laughter) And the rest of you guys are sergeants, my  friends, or privates, all that stuff. (Laughs) I remember the war all the  way from the beginning to the end. Of course, the teachers kept us  apprized to that. We had relatives and acquaintances, like I said, people  who had gone from Muskogee to Tuskegee as flyers. And we knew  those guys.  Did you meet your wife at Manual?  Yes. We were in school together and we did not pay one iota of attention  to each other and we happened to come back   see she was a real quiet  little girl. I don   t got time for no quiet little girl. (Laughs) We got back  to Muskogee at about the same time. She went to work at Washington  D.C. and we came back to Muskogee at about the same time and I asked  her for  for a date and she said  nope. Eventually she was the secretary  to the principal in the building where I first started teaching and it went  from there. She   s hospitalized now at all times.  You   ve been married how long now?  It was 49 years in August. It will be 50 years next August.  And you raised your family here?  Yes. They came through Muskogee High. My daughter was student  body president her senior year. Actually, she was co-president because  she and another young man tied. Just so happened they go to the same  church. They decided to share it, become co. So it worked out fine, too.  Because my son is just a slap-happy guy,  he  didn   t want to be  president. All he wanted to do was be in the band and beat his drums.  Nothing else mattered. (Laughs) Had a music scholarship. Only went to  music classes. Wasn   t interested in going to a chemistry class or an  English class.  So between the school, the church, music   things revolved around those  very strong parts.  Yes. So they got a sound education to prepare them to go to the next  level. Then again, we had to push them.  Do you want to talk about the political aspect?  Well Muskogee had a rousing political climate. Before Oklahoma  became a state, Muskogee was considered as a possibility for the capital  and, of course, Haskell became the first governor and he had strong  20  Muskogee connections and, I guess, that gave impetuous to all the  others. The Edmondsons from Muskogee, Representative Ed Edmonson,  whose office is now being held by Boren. Of course the other  Edmondson, the attorney general, is also from Muskogee. Then we had  Jay Howard Edmonson from Muskogee  who  was governor once upon  a time and now his brother is running to be governor next year, I believe  it is.  We had quite a rousing atmosphere here in Muskogee, whereas black  people were not elected to many of these offices, they were participants  in the voting and in the campaigning. E.S. Jennings campaigned around  the country, for example, for JFK and so did Jake Simmons. As a result  of one of those guys, I received in the mail a large invitation VIP to the  inauguration of JFK and Lyndon Baines Johnson and I didn   t go. I didn   t  have the money. I probably could have borrowed the money. If I had to  do it again, I would borrow the money and go. That was a historic  occasion, him being the first Catholic. I met Lyndon Johnson at the  dedication of the Eufaula Dam. I   m taking pictures, I was quite a  paparazzi at that time. I   m taking this picture and I   m advancing my film  and I sense somebody walking up to me and I looked up, I mean  generally looked up, and it was Lyndon Johnson. (Laughs) So we shook  hands and introduced ourselves, Johnson to Johnson, and we had quite a  little, maybe five minute, conversation because I had a bus load of kids  to go down to meet the president and see the president. That was quite  interesting. I could have met him earlier at the inaugural ball. Maybe I  could have danced with Lady Bird. (Laughter)  We   ve had some rousing district attorney races in Muskogee. I mean  they could get nasty and then the City Council. We now have a number  of blacks on the City Council. The way that Muskogee city politics  would go, a mayor, which is more or less an honorary thing, unpaid     you receive no salary. We began to campaign to get black people on the  City Council. So we finally get a mayor that says,    Okay, we can do  this.    You would get on that ticket. The black person would get on that  ticket. Now if that mayor carries that ticket and he can tell the white  voters,    This is a black person I want,    then that ticket sweeps in. When  I ran for a City Council spot, the head of the ticket couldn   t carry the  ticket. Now you   re running out of a certain ward. I did very well in my  ward but I didn   t do well across the city over into your predominant  white wards; didn   t do well there. So there was some thought in maybe  suing the city because maybe you   re in violation of some voting right  here by electing City Council across the district rather than just out of  the district.  We had looked out at Joplin or Springfield, they had that same problem.  They sued on the racial issue and they won it. And then Tulsa says,    We  21  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  better change ours.    So blacks on the Tulsa City Council are elected  from the wards only. Whichever ward you represented, that   s the vote  we count for you, but not across the district. Then it was decided,    Well  that   s not going to apply to Muskogee because Muskogee does have  black people on the City Council.    Doesn   t matter how you got there,  but you   re there. We   re still looking at changing the form of government  in Muskogee. So politics, I would say, are everywhere. Some people are  quite political and some don   t even bother to vote. For example,  Muskogee turn out in the last election was pitiful when you count the  number of people who voted and the number of people who were  registered to vote and you see the difference and what could have been  done. But politically, it has been interesting.  They didn   t come out to vote for Obama?  No. Obama did not carry a single county in Oklahoma. Oklahoma was  totally red. Now that is going to hurt the democrats. I wouldn   t be  surprised if we did not have a democrat elected in the next round of  elections   none, because the way the thing is going now with this health  issue. They   re going to equate every democrat, they   re going to hook  them up with Obama, and they   re going to vote against him. I do not  look for a democrat to win anything in Oklahoma in the next round of  elections. That   s going to be interesting. We   ll take a good look at that.  That   s going to be interesting.  That   s another thing that Manual did. They prepared you for a leadership  spot and it looked as if they would pick out somebody. They   d say,    I  want to prepare you for that,    or    I want to do you for this.    And it  worked. You look at the number of guys that we had who were officers  in the military   it was that leadership. Our last 2008 reunion, I think we  had about four or five people, black men from Manual Training High  School, who were either in the military or they had retired from the  military with a high rank like Lieutenant, Major, several Lieutenant  Colonels, Sergeant First Class, Master Sergeants and all that. I attribute  that to the leadership training that they got from Manual Training High  School. And of course, we had an image to go by, you know. You look  at Harry Hodges, retired captain in the military, and all the men who  were on that faculty. They were in a leadership position and  unconsciously you would want to imitate them. I remember distinctly  when I went into administration, I   m going to use a voice like Harry  Hodges did, and it works. You speak it with authority and it works.  Do you want to demonstrate?  Well I remember we were having an assembly at Alice Robertson   I  went to Alice Robertson as assistant principal. The principal was in the  22  Finchum  Johnson  reserves, in the National Guard. He went on active duty and that left me  there   no experience in anything. Now we   re in an assembly and we  have some kids in the balcony who are not paying attention. They   re  about to get disruptive. So I just step into the mic and I said,    Teachers  would you get someone up there to the balcony and see what       you  know, I spoke something of that sort and they went up there and they  stopped. That   s Harry Hodges again. And when Harry Hodges spoke  that authoritative voice, even the teachers paid attention. (Laughs) And  all that was for a man to copy after. Also, he dressed real well and I did  that, too. I had that image or had that idol.  Did you always want to be a high school teacher or did it just kind of  happen?  Well I had several things that I was looking at. One, I knew I didn   t want  to do construction work. I didn   t want to do labor work and then I had an  ego. I   ll be a janitor for a little while, but I don   t want to be a janitor. I  don   t want my kids saying,    My dad is a janitor.    And there   s nothing  wrong with being a janitor but again, it   s that stupid ego because we  have got to have them. Matter of fact, they kind of run the school, too.  So, I   m looking at these thinking,    I really don   t want to go to work. So  I   ll go to school.    I even toyed with the idea of maybe a medical career.  I took chemistry and biology and all that kind of stuff, but I always  would gravitate back towards history. I   m not going to work as hard as I  should in physics and that kind of stuff. I just got a C in chemistry, I got  nine hours of C in chemistry, so I   d better get into something else. So, it  turned out to be history and sociology and those things, which is really  interesting. I just didn   t go deep enough, like I said, that PhD in history  would have been interesting.  By teaching, you learn a lot. For example, I had some kids when you  were teaching certain things, like the Constitution, those kids questioned  what did that Constitution mean and who was it referring to? They  didn   t think it was referring to them. Like I said, these are sharp kids. So  that caused me to think, too. Are we teaching history or are we teaching  propaganda? Well, basically we were teaching propaganda. We talked  about the Trail of Tears in history class, but we didn   t go deep into what  caused the Trail of Tears. Morally, was this right? Morally, was the  federal government   s policy of extermination toward Native Americans  right? We didn   t go into that. We talked about that we brought them all  to Oklahoma and gave them land. You didn   t give them what you took.  It wasn   t equal to what you took.  So those kids were beginning to question that. I didn   t question that until  they questioned it and then,    Hey, wait a minute here. These kids are on  to something.    So we would have those lively discussions in the  23  Finchum  Johnson  classroom. They just questioned. They would question you. Very good.  Like I said, these were sharp kids and when I say they were sharp, you  can measure how sharp they were by what they are doing today. You  know, you   ve got a dermatologist over here, a doctor. You   ve got a  lawyer over here. You have an electrical engineer over here. They have  just gone on to do things, which doesn   t particularly surprise you.  They were respectful when they asked?  Very respectful. Very, very respectful. Enough to know that we could  get a discussion going here. We   ll say,    So Columbus discovered  America in 1492. Did he really? How did he discover something when  people were already here?    You could say he was maybe the first  European, but that   s come under some question, also. And then in  Europe, what caused him to stumble upon America is what he actually  did because he was trying to find a shorter route to India for trade  purposes. But we classify him as the hero because he discovered  America. (Laughs) We didn   t go into those details. Your history books  were not really written to cover everything. They were written as a  propaganda deal.  Now, it didn   t have much about the contributions of the slaves, and after  slavery, in those history books. If you put too much in there, districts  won   t buy it, states won   t buy the book. For example, if you were to put  anything in the history book favorable to an ex-slave or whatever  contribution black people made to America, Texas schools wouldn   t buy  those books. The state of Texas wouldn   t buy that book. So you   ve got  to watch that kind of stuff.  They didn   t explain in the history books how we happened to acquire the  territory to build the Panama Canal, which shenanigans the American  government pulled to do that. We didn   t go through the shenanigans on  the Spanish American War. Spain blew up   I can   t think of the name of  the ship   it was never evident that Spain did that or had anything to do  with that. So we had to declare war on Spain because we wanted that  territory. We want Spain out of this territory, so we   ll do it that way.  And it   s the same way in politics. We didn   t really teach political  science. We taught, and are probably still teaching, political propaganda.  Those are some of the things that need to be corrected.  They   re not going to be put anything up of any value in any history book  about the contribution of Dr. George Washington Carver, and who knew  about the Tuskegee Flyers basically until the movie came out except  those of us over in the black community? We knew who they were and  what they did. But all of America didn   t know that. We have air shows  around the country now of the Tuskegee chapter of flyers in Kansas  24  City, Missouri. But they   re seldom invited to any of the air shows. And  some of those guys can still fly. The younger fellows are perhaps still  flying some of the planes. But they were never really recognized and  then you go off to war and you have really become a warrior and you  come home and you get lynched.  When we came home from the Korean War, we couldn   t even get a job  in Muskogee. That was one of the reasons why I went back to school,  too, because the only jobs I could get were below minimum wage  probably. So I could go to school and draw my G.I. Bill and I don   t have  any dependents, so why not do that? Another motive to do that. I didn   t  know anything about it. I think it was a fight in    69. I didn   t know  anything about the black division that actually saved America   s behind  at the Battle of the Bulge. I happened to be reading a letter to the editor  of the Tulsa World and this lady, I think, from Sapulpa had written a  letter to the editor. She had gone out and gone over some of the letters  her husband wrote her at the Battle of the Bulge and he was telling her  how this black outfit fought and so you get to checking into that.  At about that same thing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the basketball star, his  daddy was in that. But his daddy never talked about it until for some  reason or another, they did get into a conversation over it. And he was so  taken with it that he wrote a book about that one outfit  Brothers in  Arms: The Epic Story of the 761st Tank Battalion, WWII's Forgotten  Heroes  and there was one black soldier from Chickasaw, Oklahoma  who was nominated for the congressional medal of honor. The Army  claims they lost the records, but his company commander was still living  when Clinton became president, so he went after Clinton to go ahead  and do this and Clinton awarded it to his heirs because he died on the  battlefield. And that   s how they finally got it, years after the war was  over. They didn   t lose those records. They didn   t lose them.  I was among the first integrated bunch of military guys, especially in this  area. But when Truman signed the papers to integrate the military, many  of the generals didn   t want that. Eisenhower didn   t want this black  outfit. This was Patton   s baby over there at the Battle of the Bulge   I  think it was Patton. He calls for this black outfit to come in. Eisenhower  and the other generals didn   t want him. They said,    They can   t do this,  they can   t do that.    Well the same way in the pilot program.    Those  guys don   t have the aptitude to learn to fly airplanes and become fighter  pilots.    We had to overcome all of that and we did it. Now we   ve got a  black president. (Laughs) Don   t know for how long  Maybe one term, if  he can get through this one term. See, this health care will probably be a  problem for him, but Muskogee has made quite a contribution to  America, especially black people. They   ve made quite a contribution to  America.  25  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Is the airport still run by a black man?  No, the airport complex now is a sports complex. They closed it. And  now we have Davis Field which is basically military stuff.  So Hatbox is no longer in   .  No, Hatbox is no longer in existence.  How did it get that name? Do you have any idea?  I sure don   t. It may have been because it was so small. It was like a little  hat box. (Laughter) It was that small. You had a few British pilots  trained out there during World War II. I guess most of those guys may  have been up around Miami, Oklahoma in training. But there were a few  here in Muskogee.  Well, with Camp Gruber, did that bring more blacks in?  Yes. There were a good number of black soldiers who came through  here that were stationed out here. Also, German POW   s were stationed  there and they came into various parts of the town and around to work.  You didn   t particularly have to worry about them, they were glad the  war was over. And you   re out here at Camp Gruber. You are the enemy,  but you   re going to get better treatment than this black guy out here who  was fighting for the country. They could go to the PX and all that kind  of stuff. We couldn   t do that. But you were wearing the uniform. I don   t  know how or why, I still question,    Why did those guys fly like that for  a country that doesn   t honor them?    But they   re up there shooting down  German planes and fighting and giving up their lives for America. They  did not lose a bomber. When they escorted a bomber plane on a  bombing mission, they didn   t lose any planes. They did not lose one  bomber that they were escorting   none. They were just fearless. I kind  of think they must have been smoking marijuana before they got in that  plane. (Laughter) Because, man, some of the things they did, I heard  about that this stuff. I didn   t believe it at first.  There was a man from Muskogee named McGuiness. Now McGuiness  crashed a couple of days before graduation and died. In the meantime,  Faith was told to jump   the parachute. Well he wouldn   t do it. Going to  save his plane. No. Those planes, once the engine quit, you couldn   t  hardly do anything with them. They have something now where you can  probably glide them in, but not that one. These guys were doing these  types of things who couldn   t sit at a lunch counter in Muskogee, but they  fought for the country, gave their lives for the country. You can   t have  anything but respect. But like I said, Harry Hodges, who became  26  principal and counselor and chemistry teacher at Manual Training High  School, was a retired captain and I think I had a wood work teacher  named Crawford Lidell who was also an officer in World War II. But  again, these guys were the cream of the crop. But things are changing  drastically now. Those wars took quite a toll on black America by  upsetting the sex ratio   World War I and World War II. Because you  took the best and they did not come back the best if they came back at  all. They just upset that sex ratio issue. That is one good reason why  you   ll find more women. Women live longer than men anyways, so they  say, so that may be a natural thing. And then you put these other things  in on top of that, like wars, and it really has a negative effect on the sex  ration, especially wars like Vietnam. That was during the days of the  draft.  Now I happened to be on the board as co-chairmen of the board of  Muskogee when we quit drafting and shut it down. But you were more  likely to be drafted during that era. And you were more likely to go to  Vietnam than the white guy was. If you could stay in school then you  had an exemption and if you went off to Canada and there were various  other ways you stayed out to avoid the draft. If you take a look at the  clips of Vietnam, look at the number of black African Americans that  you will see in Vietnam as opposed to what you see now. But at one  time the Army was about 23 percent black but we were only ten to  eleven percent of the population. So we were over represented in the  military just as well as we were over represented in the prisons. And  we   re underrepresented in colleges and universities. Now you   ll hear  some folks say that there are perhaps more black men in prison than  there are in the universities, I don   t think that   s true. But still, we   re  overrepresented in the prison system. And some of that does have to do  with your race. Not all of it, but some of it does. But we struggle on. We  don   t have any choice.  I remember a white fellow told me,    If you don   t like this country, why  don   t you go on back to Africa?    I said,    Well I would be welcome in  Africa. Would you be welcome in Europe if you knew where you came  from?    (Laughs) He didn   t know I had insulted him. I was telling him,          I  don   t even think you know where you came from.    Of course, you know  we had a number of slaves who went back to Africa, Liberia, in that  area. I know an African guy who wrote his master   s thesis on that and  what he discovered was that those freed slaves who went back to Africa  adopted the same rules and the same psyche that they were under as  slaves. Now the place that they moved them into was already occupied,  but those folks who were already there became subjected to them. They  pushed them aside and if you were not a member of that group that came  back from slavery, you couldn   t hold office there. In other words, you  were discriminated against. You were there before they got there but you  27  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  were discriminated against, according to his master   s thesis. I wish I had  made copies of that. I just read it and gave it back to him. But it was  interesting. He had his facts down pretty good.  In the early days of Muskogee, you also had the Native Americans mixed  in.  Yes. At one time, I would say they were the biggest population because  this was Creek Territory. It was probably African American and Native  American. And of course, the Native Americans at that time, more than  likely, were slaves of the Indians because that   s how my mother   s folks  got here, over the Trail of Tears. She was Creek.  From where?  From Alabama or Georgia, one of the two. Don   t know exactly where  they came from. But my grandmother   my mother   s mother   s folks  were Native American and she was probably born shortly after they got  to Oklahoma. I tried to figure out the time that they were married, she  and my grandpa, my mother   s dad   and I   ve forgotten what calculations  I put on that trying to figure out the time frame and what have you. The  Dawes Commission and meeting in Muskogee, when they registered her,  they put some of her family on the blood role and they put some on the  Freedmen Role. She   s on the Freedmen Role rather than the Blood Role.  Well what that did was affect some of your benefits. I never really went  after the benefits, anyway. I have some cousins who do carry cards and  they get the benefits but I figured, especially at this stage of the game, I  can do just as well without it. But that was a sad story and did it have a  happy ending? I don   t think it has ended. It hasn   t ended yet. But those  are some of the interesting facts of Muskogee.  So actually in Muskogee you had an economic life. You had the  economy, the social thing, and the political thing. And that   s basically  what affects the most folks    lives. Under your social thing, you   re going  to talk about your religion and that sort of stuff and your families and  your friends and so forth. But Muskogee has not been a bad place to be  if you can make a living, if you can make a decent living that can  provide for a family. You don   t need to be rich to be happy in the first  place and this would be the place to be. You   re going to have problems,  I don   t care where you live, there   s going to be a problem of some sort.  We had people say,    I   m going up north to get away from this.    You   re  going up north, but you can   t get away from it completely.  Psychologically you might have, but not completely.  The neighborhood that you currently live in, is it integrated somewhat?  28  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Somewhat. Not as much as it was when I first moved into it because it  was aging. I got to know the people before they died. Matter of fact, the  lady across the street, she had my son to cut her yard and now my  daughter owns the place because when she died, the heiress didn   t want  it. They weren   t going to live there and the real estate people took  advantage of them.    We can sell this to black people higher than we can  white people. So we   ll only show this property to black people.    And  that   s what they did. So the neighborhood now is predominantly black.  Now I have a Hispanic family within a block, there   s another older lady  widow, and right at an angle across from me is an older couple and they  told me today,    We   re going to want to sell and downsize.    They   re in a  big old two story house, just the two of them, so I can see that. And right  across there is another couple that was close to my age. So that  neighborhood is aging.  Now I understood that they took a good portion of the Second Street  district for the mall? Were you around then?  They did, uh-huh. I had some relatives in California who owned  property in that area and I was renting property just to keep it up and  keep taxes on it and put some change in my pocket, too. Well when the  mall came through and they sold out to the mall, they got a good price  for that property. I wouldn   t have given them what the mall gave them.  There was one black family and one black business that I think got hurt  by the mall coming in and that was Mack   s Bar and Grill. It had some  fancy hamburgers. Good hamburgers.  We   ve heard about those.  Good hamburgers. Mack   s Bar and Grill. Well I don   t think that that  family negotiated hard enough because Ragsdale Mortuary was also in  that area. Well, you ought to see where they are now out on Military  Drive. They got a bigger, fancier place. And I don   t know how Ted   I  know he did some heavy negotiating. So you probably could have said,     Hey, I want you to build me this and give me a million dollars and you  can have it.    I   ve got a sneaking suspicion that   s what they did. And so  he goes to the bank with that. But you had to negotiate it. If he hadn   t  negotiated, I can   t think of anybody except her who lost anything in the  mall area. But it was there. It was their survival. It was not only black  business in there, it was also Funston Nut Company, but the housing was  predominantly black. And I think they got a fair market price. The only  thing is, you get a market price here, that   s a fair price. But you still got  to go over there and buy. Your fair market price is not going to totally  pay for where you have got to go if you upgrade that much. A nice down  payment here should be alright. But you had to negotiate or have  somebody negotiate for you. We don   t have as much communications  29  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  among each other as we should and as we used to. If you don   t know,  ask somebody. Don   t be ashamed to ask somebody. (Laughs)  Is that because the church isn   t as strong as it once was? What was the  communication line back then?  Well the churches were there also but then you had other businessmen  that you could go to.  Was there a newspaper?  Yes, we had a black newspaper. Matter of fact, I have three Cimeters  that go all the way back to 1935, I believe. And I have a negro directory,  I think it was    41 and    42. But you ask people if you don   t know. My  church is more or less an integrated Episcopal church. There is a fellow  there who is in the business of land, so I   m going to sign a gas and oil  lease on some property and they are offering anything. So I   ll take that  chance. I said,    Hey, is this a legitimate offer?    He said,    Yeah, that   s  about what this is going for, but let   s negotiate this up just a little bit and  see what happens.    So we did and we got a higher offer than what they  offered for it. I know they were looking after themselves, and I got to  look out for me. I don   t know anything about this, go ask somebody who  does and that   s what I did.  I have some other property out on Shawnee Bypass out where Wal-Mart  is, out at that area now. It was just a little parcel because it started out as  an acre and then the highway kept clipping off of it. So the company  wants to buy it and they made an offer and I asked him again,    You  think this is a good offer?    and he said,    Yeah, it   s good.    And so I sold  it at that price. (Laughs) I didn   t know anything about land, about  signing a lease agreement. I   d never done that before. My relatives way  back there before I was born, I don   t know whether they knew what they  were doing either. There was 120 acres on my mother   s side that came  up missing. Well we find this document where her dad supposedly sold  that for  250. But some of the older people said,    He didn   t know what  he was doing. He thought he was signing an oil and gas lease and they  took advantage of him and sold it for that amount of money,  250.    So  you   ve got to ask. If you don   t know, you better find out before you do  anything.  Do you have a favorite memory of Muskogee?  Actually I have a number of them. I really don   t have any bad memories  of Muskogee. The things that we enjoyed doing   we didn   t mention the  fair. We would have a fair here every fall and we   d go to school maybe a  half a day and get out to go to the fair and have children   s day. So a  30  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  Finchum  Johnson  group of us would go to the fair and we would ride and we would eat the  popcorn and that sort of stuff and the ice cream cones and that salt ice  cream, custard they called it, and it was just a fun thing to do at the fair.  And of course as we got older, we could go with our girlfriends and just  have a good time at the fair. But like I said, Muskogee was another city  within a city at that time. The black city of Muskogee was viable and  that   s basically all we knew and the society was there. We had dances,  we had cultural people come in like Hazel Scott, the pianist. We thought  were living (laughs) and we were. We didn   t have any bank presidents,  any of that sort of stuff, but we had our entrepreneurs that we looked up  to and we had our educators.  What do you think was the major change?  You   ve got to have a line of succession. The younger people won   t stay  here now. They can   t afford to. Now you can get your education here.  You can go out and do well and then come back and retire and do well,  but there   s no reason now for the younger people to stay here. So,  there   s no line of succession. And it   s just dwindling. The black  population has fallen tremendously. I often tell people that we basically  have two groups of black people in Muskogee: those of us who were  lucky enough to be able to make a sustainable living and then you have  those who can   t get out. They don   t have the economic means, they  don   t have the education, they don   t have anything. They are stuck here  and that   s basically what we have in Muskogee.  I   ve gone through my questions. Is there anything else you want to  cover?  No, I think that   s it.  Well thank you for sharing your time today.  I hope I made a contribution.  -------  -------
