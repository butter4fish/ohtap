Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask and they only require a short answer.  They're kind of a warm up.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Do I have a favorite food?  Probably--Jesus Christ, pork chops.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Bonita Springs, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's B-E--
Speaker 2: B-O-N-I-T-A (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) B-O- okay.  Bonita Springs.
Speaker 2: Bonita Springs, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, Florida.  Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I--you know, I use lots of phrases from time to time, but I don't I think I have a favorite phrase.  Some people use, you know, all the time.  I don't do that.  I try to stay away from that one.  Maybe it's, ahhh (laughter).
Story_ID: 623996
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and your father's [Frederick Douglas, Sr.] side--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and we're gonna start with your mother first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name was Inez Theresa Highland [Inez Highland Douglas].  That was her name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: H-I- H-I-G-H-L-A-N-D is Highland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Theresa T-H--or?
Speaker 2: T-H-E-R-E-S-A.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  And when was your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born June 1, 1900 in Chesterfield County, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, based on some information I got off of the Internet, her grandfather was a Scottish man, John Highland, who married a mulatto, Negro, and they had a son, John Highland, and then my mother's father [sic.] was Thomas Highland.  He married a lady, Elizabeth.  I don't know that I recall her family name.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this would be your--
Speaker 2: It could've been Thomas, Elizabeth Thomas [ph.].
Speaker 1: This is your grandfather now we're talking about, maybe--?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was John--my grandfather was Lawrence Faulkner Highland [Lawrence Highland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lawrence Faulkner Highland.  And he married an Elizabeth Thomas [Draddie Thomas Highland].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Are there any--now, you say you found out the information about this Scottish ancestor on the Internet?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So are there any stories about him, you know--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --that are passed down otherwise?
Speaker 1: No, unh-uh.  My mother was not one to talk much about her ancestors, which was tradition--typical of people born in her generation.  They just did not--I don't know whether they were not proud of the information or didn't think it was important, but they never shared a lot about their families.
Speaker 2: You're right.  That's a very typical situation in terms of--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --not sharing the information.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, are there, were there any stories on her side of the family about, about slavery or Reconstruction or--?
Speaker 1: Well, I do remember her grandmother, Mary Douglass [ph.], believe it or not was her name, two S's, but that would've been her second marriage.  She would've been a Thomas before that I suspect.  I remember visiting her.  She lived in a little town called Laurinburg, North Carolina, and--L-A-U-R-I-N-B-U-R-G, Laurinburg, North Carolina.  And she was born a slave and remembers having to go through or run through the legs of the slave master as he hit her when she was a small child.  I remember her telling me that.  This would've been in the '40s [1940s].  I would've been maybe thirteen, fourteen years of age and we visited her down in Laurinburg and she talked about that.  That was one of her memories of slavery.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, overall impression of it wasn't a lot of pleasant memories (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, around slavery.
Speaker 1: That's correct.
Speaker 2: It wasn't--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --a pleasant recollection.
Story_ID: 623997
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Inez Highland Douglas] say about growing up?
Speaker 2: Not very much.  She was the oldest of as many as perhaps eleven children.  Her mother [Ethel Previtt Highland] died in 1914 [sic.] when she was fourteen years of age, so she assisted her father [Lawrence Highland] in raising her siblings.  Then--
Speaker 1: Were they--excuse me.  Were they raised in town or out on a farm?
Speaker 2: They were in a--they were in a rural--a little town (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: They moved from Chesterfield County [South Carolina] to McColl, South Carolina, M-A-C-O-L-L [sic.], South Carolina.  And her father was a--I thought he, I think he taught school from time to time.  So after her mother passed away, she helped him raise up the kids.  And then she went away to college, went away to high school.  They didn't have a local high school.  She went away to Browning Home academy [Browning Industrial Home and Mather Academy; Mather Academy], which was located in Camden, South Carolina, some seventy or so miles from her home.
Speaker 1: Browning Home academy.
Speaker 2: Browning, B-R-O-W-I-N-G [sic.].
Speaker 1: Now do you know much about the Browning Home academy, who it was started by?
Speaker 2: It was started by some committed Caucasians.  Many of her teachers, I believe, were Caucasians as I can remember.  It may be still in existence.  I know that [HistoryMaker] James Clyburn, the current speaker of the house attended Browning Home academy.  I found that out once I was sitting with him at a dinner in Washington, D.C.  So I know until some times in the last twenty or so years, it was still in existence.  I don't know whether it still is now.  I haven't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I haven't checked that out.  But the interesting thing that I found about, I found in some artifacts, family artifacts, a printed program of her graduation.  She graduated in June of 1924 from high school.  She was twenty-four years old.
Speaker 1: And those were times where it was--you were lucky to be able to finish school, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's true because they didn't--the local schools only went to maybe eighth grade and so with her mother passing away, she became the matriarch in the family and helped her father raise up her siblings.  And even, interestingly after she and my father [Frederick Douglas, Sr.] married, they continued to raise their siblings before starting their own family.
Speaker 1: So Browning Home academy, that was like a boarding school situation where she--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --would go and stay?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the white people that started it, they weren't the American Missionary Association or--
Speaker 2: It--probably something like that.
Speaker 1: --could've been or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But we're not sure what
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who they were then?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I probably should research that myself, but--um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, well--now did she get married after she graduated or?
Speaker 2: Yes, she met my father shortly after graduating.  They were married February 1, 1925.  My father asked her father permission to marry her and he said, "No," so they sneaked away and were married secretly and did not live together until after my mother's father passed away some, some time within the same year that they got married in 1925.  They were married February 1st.
Story_ID: 623998
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side and then we'll put them together.  Can you give us your father's full name and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Frederick Weldon Douglas [Frederick Douglas, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: F--F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K, Weldon Douglas, one S.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was there any attempt to--you know, so he was a Frederick Douglas, but was there any intent on the part of his family to name him after Frederick Douglass?
Speaker 2: Well, what I found out, I was trying to, on familysearch.org, find some of our relatives.  My grandfather's name, his father was Scipio, S-I-P-P-I-O [sic. Scipio Douglas], and I couldn't find that.  So I put Frederick Douglas in and lo and behold, there was the name of a Fredrick Douglas married to a Victoria, who had a Scipio for a son.  He was born in--around 1850.  And the 1980 [sic. 1880] census showed he and his wife, Victoria [Victoria Douglas] as farmer and housekeeper.  So they were farmers during the eighty--19--1880 census, and they had seven, eight children.  And my grandfather, Scipio, was the second oldest of his children.  So the name had come from his grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  His grandfather was--you say was--
Speaker 2: Fredrick.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you found him in the nine--1880 census?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well--you know, perhaps he was named after Frederick Douglass himself (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That would be my assumption.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would--
Speaker 2: That he would've been named after Frederick Douglass, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: You would think, but--
Speaker 2: Either he was named or he took that name--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --because he would've--he would've been born during slavery--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and you don't know what happened.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know they're--I've been--I heard stories of the Union soldiers lining up the freedmen and either assigning them a name or asking them what they think their name ought to be.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And there would be, you know, a lot of George Washingtons as a result (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --and that.  But, you know--yeah, that's interesting.  So he could have but there's no family story about it--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --that we know of.
Speaker 2: Again, people didn't talk much about that.
Speaker 1: And Frederick Douglass, the, the 19th century abolitionist's last name was two S's.
Speaker 2: Two S's, that's correct.
Speaker 1: And like your ancestor on your mother's [Inez Highland Douglas] side.
Story_ID: 623999
Speaker 1: So were there any, any stories passed down in your family about life in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well, my father's father owned a very large farm, approaching a thousand acres.  That would've been in the nineteen teens [1910s], 1912 to '15 [1915] or so like that.  And my father [Frederick Douglas, Sr.], again, wanted education beyond what was offered in the local school system and asked his father permission to go away to high school.  His father denied him that permission, so it seems, and so one day my father took his younger brother, Edward [Edward Douglas], and a, and a loaded wagon of cotton, went to the gin, sold the cotton, got the money, and went away to High Point High [High Point High School; High Point Central High School], High Point, North Carolina, to high school, and sent his brother home with the empty wagon.
Speaker 1: Now did he get in trouble for that?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  His intent was, is he always--and I do remember him saying this.  He wanted to go back home and help his father save the farm because he sensed that it was in trouble, but his father died of a massive heart attack in 1919 before he was fifty years of age, having lost the farm.  Whether he had paid for it and it was snookered away from him or whatever, I don't know the exact details.  All I know is that outside of my hometown of Hamlet, North Carolina, was a large colonial white house that faced the highway and that's where my father used to live about the time he went away to high school.  But they lost that house and it was my father's desire when we were growing up to purchase it, to reclaim it so to speak.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And it had fallen somewhat in disrepair by then, but, but still, people lived in it.  But my mother [Inez Highland Douglas] never wanted to live in the country, so she says, "You're not gonna take me out there and live in that house," so the--he never followed through to repurchase the house.
Speaker 1: Now, that--there's a big story that may not have been passed down in your family and I'm not suggesting that you ought to know it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but it's a big story for somebody to find out about how he got a thousand acres of land--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how your grandfather got that land.  That's a lot of land--
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: --to get out of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --coming out of slavery.
Speaker 2: I did--'cause his name was Scipio [Scipio Douglas]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and I researched that name, and Scipio is a name of a, of a great Roman general, and why someone would name him Scipio probably suggested something special about him.  And it could've been because someone liked him or it could've been because of his father [Fredrick Douglas] that someone took a shine to him, so to speak, and allowed him to either farm on a promise to--that he would eventually own the land or snookered him, I don't know which.  You know, you just, you can't reinvent history.  But my suspicions are that he was looked upon with some favor and that was probably how he got the name Scipio.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Are there any white ancestors on his side that you remember?
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father's family were all very dark skinned people with I don't think any, any Caucasian blood at all.  My mother, like I said, her grandfather was John Highland--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --from Scotland, a rug maker, a rug salesman, and she was fair as are my two siblings [Frederick Douglas, Jr. and Shirley Douglas Townsend].  I'm like my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was probably darker than I am.
Story_ID: 624000
Speaker 1: That is a heck of a story though, a thousand acres of land and then to--so the family lost the land (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but your father like he, he--you said he--did he finish High Point [High Point High School; High Point Central High School, High Point, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: He finished High Point.  He came back home and, again, raised--assisted in the raising of--he being one of the older kids.  He had two older brothers, Ernest [Ernest Douglas] the oldest and Arch [Archie Douglas], he was third.  His father, Scipio [Scipio Douglas], had three wives and three sets of children.  My father was in the older set, which included Ernest, Arch, Frederick [Frederick Douglas, Sr.], Odessa [Odessa Douglas], and Ethel [Ethel Douglas Ellerbee], three boys and two girls.  And then he married a McCollum [Martha McCollum Douglas], Scipio married a McCollum, and they had Edward [Edward Douglas] and Samuel [Samuel Douglas] and Arnold [Arnold Douglas] and several other children.  And, of course, she died and then he married his third wife who outlived him.  And then all I remember is the youngest was James [James Douglas].  James Weldon would--would've been the youngest child.  And the Weldon name, interesting in the fact that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --both my father and James had Weldon in their name, which suggests another family tree of history, and I don't know what that would've been.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, we're reminded of James Weldon Johnson--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the famous poet.
Speaker 2: But that was 19--that was afterwards.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But he had that name also.
Speaker 1: I think he was--I don't know exactly where he was born but he ended up in--I know he was in Florida in the early days--
Speaker 2: Jacksonville, Florida.
Speaker 1: Jacksonville, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 624001
Speaker 1: So what did your father [Frederick Douglas, Sr.]--did he--he graduated in 1919 you said?
Speaker 2: Well, he, he graduated sometime around 1919 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --from high school [High Point High School; High Point Central High School, High Point, North Carolina].  He began teaching school, eventually met my mother [Inez Highland Douglas], and they were married on February 1, 1925, moved to Hamlet, North Carolina, and continued to raise their respective siblings.  And then in 1930, my brother, Frederick, Jr., Frederick Douglas--Frederick Weldon Douglas, Jr. [Frederick Douglas, Jr.], was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was born on July 10, 1930.  And my mother's--and my father's family began to disperse.  My father's family went mostly to Newport News, Virginia, to work in the shipyards, and my mother's siblings went to Newark, New Jersey, where her youngest sibling, my Aunt Mary [Mary Highland], is still alive.  She celebrated her hundredth birthday in 2009.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have any other siblings besides your older brother?
Speaker 2: I have a--I have my older brother and I have a sister, Shirley [Shirley Douglas Townsend]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who was born January 3, 1935.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about--that your parents told about how they met?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't recall there being a story other than my father--there were always some pictures that were in the family and no one ever told you who they were, but there was another young guy who allegedly was courting my mother and somehow my father beat him out.  I do remember that much of it, but they wouldn't talk too much about that.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear of why your mother's father [Lawrence Highland] didn't like your father?
Speaker 2: He--I--he--it wasn't he didn't like him.  I think he just didn't want his daughter to leave home.  My guess is he sensed that he was not well and probably wanted to make sure that she would continue to carry some responsibility for raising the kids who were still there, and she did along with my father who, who brought in some of his siblings as well.
Story_ID: 624002
Speaker 1: So your father [Frederick Douglas, Sr.] continued to teach school--
Speaker 2: Well, he started teaching school then and he, he, he eventually became a principal.  My mother [Inez Highland Douglas], after they were married and their siblings left, she had the three of us.  And the two of them then agreed that she would go away to college, and she went to Fayetteville State College [Fayetteville State Teachers College; Fayetteville State University] in Fayetteville, North Carolina.  And my father taught school and at the, in the school, was a principal and took care of us with the assistance of his sister, Odessa [Odessa Douglas].  So my mother was away.  I can remember those years shortly after my sister [Shirley Douglas Townsend] was born with my mother being away and coming home on weekends.  It was, it was one of the things I'm amazed that they were able to do that, that he raised us and allowed her to go away to college, but that was because of his strong belief in education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is during the Depression [Great Depression], too.  You're talking about--
Speaker 2: This was the late--
Speaker 1: --the heart of the Depression (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) late '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: And once she completed her training, I don't know whether she had a college degree at the time or she had several years of college because back at that time, you could teach without having a full degree, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.  You'd have like a two year normal degree.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Normal school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But she did eventually complete her undergraduate work and both of them had master's degrees before their teaching careers ended.  She taught with him at the East Hamlet elementary school [Hamlet Avenue School, Hamlet, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Is that the school he was principal of?
Speaker 2: Yes, East Hamlet elementary school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: And she taught with him for her entire career.
Story_ID: 624003
Speaker 1: Now when you consider your parents' personalities and their talents and their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I, I have some characteristics from both.  My intellect, my father [Frederick Douglas, Sr.] was an educator and he believed in education, and he was a magnanimous individual.  He gave.  So I acquired those talents from him.  I'm a giver more than a taker and that's what he was.  My mother [Inez Highland Douglas] was a kind of an intellectual.  She loved to read.  She loved geography.  She loved worldly views of things and I, I got those characteristics from her.  So I have some of both.
Story_ID: 624004
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory was--is probably me inside of a, a screened baby bed.  You know, you know how they have the sides that go up and down, well back then, I guess because of the flies, they were screened.  It was like you'd open the door and put the kid inside.  I remember look--peering out from inside and my mother [Inez Highland Douglas] was talking to a neighbor.  And I, as I can best remember, it would've probably been Julia Breeden [Julia Jackson Breeden], who would've been a young adult person--younger than my mother but, but still an adult who lived right down the street.
Story_ID: 624005
Speaker 1: So you, you, you grew up in Ham-, in Hamlet [North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --itself.
Speaker 2: In Hamlet.  It--small town.  At that time, the census around 1940 would've had it at about five thousand people.  That would--I'm not so sure how the census counted it whether the--that was inside of the corporate limits.  We lived inside the corporate limits, but then there was an area called the north yard [Hamlet Yard, Hamlet, North Carolina].  Hamlet is a railroad town and it's built right along the route of the railroad, north south railroad line, and then there was a spur that went east and west from Wilmington [North Carolina] on the east to Birmingham, Alabama, on the west.  But the town grew up around the railroad.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you had a like a north south line and a east west line--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --kind of meet.
Speaker 2: North yard was, the north yard area was where the northbound tracks were and they had a round house and an area where they linked trains together.  You know, they transferred cars and all of that kind of stuff.  It was a big deal when I grew up in Hamlet 'cause railroads were king back then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you know which railroad ran through there?
Speaker 2: Seaboard Air Line Railroad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Seaboard, okay.  Now was there a black side of town in Hamlet--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and a white side.
Speaker 2: Where we lived would've, would've been--it would've been the area closest to the white community.  We lived two blocks from white families.  And then the further you went north, there was more concentration of blacks.  But then there were a few whites that lived even along Highway 177 [North Carolina Highway 177], which ran north and south up to the north yard.  I remember there was a section just a little east of us across the highway where Nolan, Miss Nolan [ph.] had a store, and that was an all-white area, it would've been two blocks, and then Greene's store was right down the hill from us behind.  So in small towns in the South, there was a distinct white area like the heights where no blacks lived at all.  But then in some of the other areas, there was close interface between white settlements of people, small, and black settlements of people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there were all-black areas.  But being a small town, you only got five thousand people, it wouldn't be like a huge metropolitan community with real defined black white areas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, I just wondered--now, I--two--I think there are only two states in the Union that have had like higher black populations than white.  South Carolina was still one of them.  I don't know if it still is, but Mississippi and South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: I know Mississippi still is, but--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --what about--did you have a sense of that growing up, that there were more black folks there than--
Speaker 2: Well, North Carolina was always considered the--a border state where racial attitudes were not perceived to be as harsh as they were in the Deep South (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the--
Speaker 2: --states like--
Speaker 1: Okay.  You, you grew up in North Carolina, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Not South Carolina, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  But the population is--I'm sure it's majority white and North Carolina is--it's kind of an interesting state is that it's one of the few states that has no real big cities.  I mean, Charlotte [North Carolina] is now kind of a metropolitan, a huge area, but when I was growing up, Charlotte had just one hundred thousand people and Raleigh [North Carolina] had like fifty thousand and Fayetteville [North Carolina] had twenty-five or thirty and Greensboro [North Carolina] was about eighty thousand.  But there were no huge cities in North Carolina, and it's just, just--it was a great place to grow up now that I look back at it.  I didn't realize it then.
Story_ID: 624006
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the smells are, the sounds were the railroads.  I--you could lay on your bed and set your watch by the trains that came all times of the day.  They always blew when they were leaving or coming.  And there were, there were twenty-five passenger trains during the war years that came through my hometown, so everybody was tuned into the railroads.  That was one of the greats, the great sounds in our community.  And when the diesel engines came, it was kind of exciting.  People would come down to the station sometimes just to stand around and watch the train traffic.  Because it being, it being such a huge terminal, there were a lot of transfers of people coming in and out of town.  One of the stories that--and this is an accurate story that was told, Booker T. Washington back in the early 1900s on his way to Washington [D.C.] to receive an award from--in Washington, the Seaboard Railroad was alerted that he was going to be coming from Tuskegee [Alabama] and he was going to change trains in Hamlet [North Carolina] and would have to eat.  So the Seaboard Air Line Railroad says, "You guys have to make some accommodations for Mr. Washington."  When he got there, the Terminal Hotel [Hamlet, North Carolina] which was a hotel owned by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad devised a scheme where they hung a bed sheet down the middle of the, of the dining room to allow Mr. Washington and his party to eat on one side while the regular hotel guests ate on the other side.  And I'm--I understand that that did not meet with favor from some of the patrons as you might imagine in, in the early 1900s, but, but nonetheless, it, it happened.
Story_ID: 624007
Speaker 1: I wanted to go back and ask you about the Booker T. Washington dinner again.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, they have a--here's a big celebrity coming to town.  You know, they want to honor him, but yet he's black, so they don't know what to do, so they put a sheet up in the big hotel or the biggest one there.
Speaker 2: Right, the only hotel there.
Speaker 1: The only hotel.
Speaker 2: The Terminal Hotel [Hamlet, North Carolina] was, which was, it was a block from the railroad lines.  I mean, the trains came right by the Terminal Hotel.  And they knew he had to eat, so they made an accommodation for him and let him eat at the hotel with his party.  So they ate, got back on the train and went to Washington [D.C.].  Now, I don't know what happened on the return trip, probably the same thing.
Speaker 1: I imagine the hotel staff, the staff that cooked for him was black.  I imagine--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.
Speaker 1: But they had to have a sheet up.  And you said also during the break that Roland Hayes came through.  And tell--
Speaker 2: Ro- Roland Hayes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Roland Hayes--our next door neighbor, Mrs. Florence Smith, whose husband was a dining cart porter or waiter I should say, not porter, dining cart waiter, she was a songstress, an al- contralto and loved to sing.  So she arranged for Roland Hayes to come to town.  And, of course, this was a big deal.  But then, the whites wanted to hear him sing as well.  And so the devised prescription was that there would be a rope that ran right down the center of the auditorium with whites sitting on--and as a matter of fact, they sat on the right side and blacks sat on the left side of the rope in the auditorium.  And I recall that he gave just a phenomenal concert.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, these are the--this is what you have to do if you're gonna maintain segregation and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --you know, world, in the world of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then I also remember Franklin Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt].  I don't remember it, but my parents [Inez Highland Douglas and Frederick Douglas, Sr.] told me about him coming to town.  He used to go to Augusta [Georgia] or someplace in Georgia, Warm Springs, Georgia, not Augusta.  And, of course, a direct route would've been the Seaboard Air Line Railroad.  And his train came through with his, with his car, probably the last one on the train, and I recall that the train stopped and many people went down and saw Franklin Roosevelt as he came through town.  Now that may have happened more than once because he went down there a lot, but I do remember people talking about it.
Story_ID: 624008
Speaker 1: What were some of the other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there was cotton was the chief farm crop in, in our area but with some tobacco as well.  So there was--I grew up during an era where--and my father [Frederick Douglas, Sr.] had a small farm that he purchased just to keep my brother [Frederick Douglas, Jr.] and I off the streets, to give us something to do.  But it was part of his genes, too.  He had been a farmer growing up.  And I remember us tending the farm, which was not very far from our home, about two miles from our home on the other side of town outside of south Hamlet [North Carolina].  And I can remember the era when Saturdays, people would drive their horse and buggies to town to do their weekly commerce and I remember downtown, there would be a few vacant lots with some trees there and people would tie their horses and wagons there while they did their, their day's work, their shopping or visiting or whatever they did on Saturdays.  So I, and I can remember horse hoofs, wagons, people selling watermelons on the street.  There would be trucks and there would be wagons with horses.  So, you saw both.  I grew up in an era when it was just as common to see someone on the highway with a wagon and they would generally ride on the, on the edge of the highway with one wheel off the highway and one wheel on, not creating a dangerous situation for cars, but they both occupied the highways.  I remember those visuals from the area that I grew up in.  We had other incidents that happened in my home town.  The high school was a Rosenwald school, which was a school that--the Rosenwalds, they built schools all over the South during that period.  And in the early '40s [1940s], just before school was to open, our school burned down.  Nobody knows how or why, probably just an electrical fire or some situation, but the fire hydrants in our hometown, the closest one was probably, oh, over a half a mile away.  And the fire department did not have enough hose to reach the school, so we just kind of watched it burn down.  That obviously created a great emergency for our community.  The Masonic hall and churches became the venues where kids then went to school and then we went in double shifts.  The Pine Street elementary school [Pine Street School, Hamlet, North Carolina] was the school I attended and the East Hamlet elementary school [Hamlet Avenue School, Hamlet, North Carolina] was the one that my father taught at, so those schools went to double shifts.  And then the upper grades--my brother I think would've been in probably the seventh grade or something like that--was in the Presbyterian church.  So we used the churches and we used the Masonic hall and all those kind--until they built--rebuilt the school.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it was rebuilt?
Speaker 2: It was rebuilt, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 624009
Speaker 1: What were you interested in growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, I was mostly a daydreamer.  I, I--I've always dreamt a lot about things and issues and all of that kind of thing.  So, that's how I spent a lot of my time.  But at the same time, I loved baseball.  Everybody played baseball back in those days, and as I got a little older, I played a little basketball, but I was not that good at basketball, but I loved baseball.  So like most kids during that era, we played baseball, softball too, but primarily hard ball was what we played, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Did the Negro League teams come through and play?
Speaker 2: There were some local Negro League teams and my father [Frederick Douglas, Sr.] used to sell tickets.  He was the ticket taker on Sunday for Reverend Rush [ph.] who owned and sponsored this local team.  And so I'd go to all the baseball games downtown and watch the drama of what went on.  And I remember at one point, I always wanted a glove and I didn't have one and, and I finally got one.  But then one day while I was there just hanging over the dugout, Reverend Rush rolled me a brand new baseball and I still remember that.  That was my first baseball that--and he just gave it to me, you know, because he knew who I was and that my father was taking tickets for him and accounting for the money.  But teams from all over, from Laurinburg [North Carolina], from Tatum [South Carolina] and from Bennettsville [South Carolina].  There was a game every Sunday.  And these guys could play baseball.  And it was, it was what everybody did.  And then the gentleman who worked at the radi- railroad station while they were servicing trains or between trains, that's all they talked about was baseball.  And if you just stood around, you could just hear them talk--and this was during the early '40s [1940s] or the mid-'40s [1940s] after Jackie Robinson started playing.  I mean, it was just--that was it.  Everybody was into baseball.  And, of course, there was no television but there were rad- there was radio, and everybody listened to the baseball games.  I used to listen to the baseball games on the radio myself.  I still do occasionally, but--when I'm in my car.  But I'd stay up until twelve or one o'clock while my wife [Retha Hughes Douglas] is sleeping listening to--I'm sorry, I--listening to baseball games on the radio (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the games on the radio, did they ever broadcast any of the black games on the radio?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I didn't think so.
Speaker 2: No.  This was just--
Speaker 1: Major League games?
Speaker 2: Major League games.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you would've been about thirteen I guess when Jackie Robinson came into--
Speaker 2: Thirty-three [1933], yep.  Yeah, about thirteen, twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 1: I imagine that had a big impact on you and all your contemporaries I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The newspapers, the Norfolk Journal and Guide [New Journal and Guide] and the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] were the local black newspapers that were sold.  In fact, I used to help one of our neighbors, Mrs.--Mr. Hillian [ph.] delivered the paper, the Norfolk Journal and Guide was the big one in our community back then.  And there would always be these pictures of Jackie Robinson but also pictures of Louis Jordan and other celebrities, people like Ella Fitzgerald.  Dinah Washington may have come along later, but I do remember there--Nat King Cole.  And, you know, you look at these pictures and they would always be of far off places like Detroit [Michigan] or Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and Baltimore [Maryland] or New York, Harlem [New York, New York], always favorite cities.  I don't remember much about the West Coast back in those days.  But, but that's, that's where these papers tended to feature the happenings of the day.
Story_ID: 624010
Speaker 1: All the big cities were the--I guess, the most romantic kind of places that people--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they, they thought about going to.  What was your first trip to a big city?  Did, did you get a chance to go to a big city when you were young?
Speaker 2: Well, my first trip out of Hamlet, outside--other than to Pinehurst [North Carolina] where my mother's [Inez Highland Douglas] brother lived or Laurinburg [North Carolina] which was sixteen miles in the other direction was Newport News, Virginia, and my father [Frederick Douglas, Sr.] took my sister [Shirley Douglas Townsend] and I--my father's sister [Odessa Douglas] took us up to spend a couple weeks with her in 19--it would've been 1938.  And I know that because that's the--I started school.  I started school at five years of age.  My father decided that rather than me sitting home and my mother was away in college [Fayetteville State Teachers College; Fayetteville State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina] that--put me in school.  So then he came and got us.  So I remember while I was in Newport News that summer for the period that I was there, going to Buckroe Beach [Hampton, Virginia], but I was afraid of the water.  I remember that, too, because it was the huge waves that I saw coming in.  But, nonetheless, I remember going to, to Newport News, Virginia.  That was my first trip away from Hamlet.  My next trip north other than back to Newport News in the '40s [1940s] with my brother, Freddie [Frederick Douglas, Jr.], would've been actually when I got into college and--just before I went to college [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].  I went to Washington, D.C., and spent the summer with a friend of mine and his parents and worked out in College Park [Maryland].  They lived out in that area, a little place called Lakeland [College Park, Maryland], and I cut grass and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --did landscaping work that summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then, as a junior, I went to New York City [New York, New York] for the first time, the most scary thing I think I'd ever done (laughter).  And not only did I go, but I was going up for--to work at a, at a camp up in Pennsylvania, but the, but the chef who was hiring all us black kids, we had to all go--come to his house and he lived out on Long Island [New York].  So not only did I have to ride a train from Hamlet, North Carolina, to New York City, I had to get off and I had to catch a subway out on Long Island and transfer and catch a bus.  I did it (laughter) and I'm still fascinated that I didn't get lost, so--and if you get lost, what would you do (laughter)?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that sounds like quite the adventure.
Story_ID: 624011
Speaker 1: Let me take you back to grade school.  Now, now you started at Pine Street elementary school [Pine Street School, Hamlet, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No, I started over at ele- at East Hamlet--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --elementary school [Hamlet Avenue School, Hamlet, North Carolina].  My father [Frederick Douglas, Sr.] took me to school with him as I was, I had just turned five.  My birthday is in August, August 22nd, and that September, I started first grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how did you like school?
Speaker 2: I was indifferent to school.  I was, I could comprehend what was going on.  I was a fairly good student, but I was, I was not a shining star when I started.  I don't remember anything that made me stand out from anybody else in my class when I started.  I always liked math.  It became rather natural to me.  I've always thought now that I'm older and looking back, I may have been a little bit dyslexic then, but I learned to read and I got along.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Did I have a favorite teacher?  Probably Miss Mask, Mrs. Mask, M-A-S-K.  She and her husband who was when I was growing up, the principal of the high school then, and he resigned in favor of his son when his son graduated from Saint Aug [Saint Augustine's College; Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina] and he made him the principal.  But, his wife, Mrs. Mask, continued to teach seventh grade.  So when I was in seventh grade--and I had known her because she would always have me do favors across the street for her and sometimes spend the night with her when her husband was away to keep from being alone, so I got to know her.  And she loved geography like my mother [Inez Highland Douglas].  And I would say she was probably my favorite teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In high, in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's see, so you, you were at East Hamlet until--
Speaker 2: East Hamlet for two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the--when--in the third, third grade, that would've been the year that the high school burned down.  And, of course, the restrictions got to be you gotta go where you gotta go, and then that's--and I was old enough to walk to school.  And so my sister [Shirley Douglas Townsend] and I went to the Pine Street elementary school, which was about five blocks from our house.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was closer than--
Speaker 2: It was close.
Speaker 1: --than the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, East Hamlet--
Speaker 1: --school--okay.
Speaker 2: --would've been two miles away.  But I rode with my father over there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in the third grade, my sister would've started school and so the two of us then walked together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was it, was it, was it very, was it, did it make a big difference to you going to Pine Street rather than--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --East Hamlet?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it was just what you do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--now did you know John Coltrane when he was growing up?
Speaker 2: No.  I knew nothing about him until later I learned that he grew up in Hamlet [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause he would've been, would he, he would've been older than you were.
Speaker 2: He would've been older than me.
Speaker 1: Much older, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now that I think about it.  I don't know what year he was born.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But I'm guessing--
Speaker 2: Probably early '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: Probably 1925, something like that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-four [1924], '25 [1925].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He'd be in his eighties now, I guess, if he was still alive.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 624012
Speaker 1: Now, you went to Pine Street [Pine Street School, Hamlet, North Carolina] through--
Speaker 2: Through sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Through sixth grade, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And then I went to the high school, the school--it was a, it was a K to 12 school--now, not K to 12 [kindergarten to twelfth grade].  We didn't have kindergarten in Hamlet [North Carolina] when I was growing up, first grade through twelfth grade.  And it was--the name of the school was the Capital Highway High School [Hamlet, North Carolina] because it was right on Highway 77 [North Carolina Highway 77] and everybody used to refer to it, you know that school was named after the highway (laughter).  They called it the Capital Highway High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So this is, this is a segregated black school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --just like all of them were--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in those days.  And what--it was different from the one that--now--
Speaker 2: The early one had been a Rosenwald school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This--
Speaker 1: The Rosenwald school, did they call that--did they have the same name or?
Speaker 2: You know, I can't answer that question.  I really don't know.  I suspect it could've been.  But this new school had a gym, an indoor gym, so we played basketball inside whereas I remember the Rosenwald school did not have a gym, so when we played basketball or when the teams played basketball, they played outside, as was the case of a lot of schools in the area.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have heard that.  Now you--it's hard for people to imagine now and people playing, you know, out--in fact, some--I've heard of some without even a paved court.
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't paved.  It was, it was--they used cinders, so if you fell, you got a strawberry like you wouldn't believe (laughter).  You know, I mean, you know, cinders from--in a, in a railroad town, you had a lot of cinders for coal ashes, but they put that down and tamp it down and that became the hard surface that you played on, cinders.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is like on a track.
Story_ID: 624013
Speaker 1: Now when you were in high school [Capital Highway High School, Hamlet, North Carolina], did you, did your interests change or anything or did you, were you more, more interested in other subjects other than math or--?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I was a wannabe.  I wanted to play basketball because the basketball players were always very popular and the girls liked them, but I didn't have the skills, so I was kind of a nerdy kid growing up, shy, introverted in many respects.  But because my parents [Inez Highland Douglas and Frederick Douglas, Sr.] were prominent educators, a lot was expected of me.  And so I was always faced with the challenge of being pushed forward for things that I didn't really want to do.  I remember in high school going to Greensboro, North Carolina.  There was an annual competition for shop class and stuff like that, but then there were oratorical contests, and there was kind of a organization with statewide offices.  And so, we were there and it came time to nominate people to serve as officers and somebody from Hamlet [North Carolina] put my name up.  I was scared to death.  I wasn't elected, but thank God I wasn't 'cause I wouldn't have, I would've frozen.  I had, I had no speaking skills to speak of at the time.  We didn't have voice or public speaking in high school.  I would, I could've truly benefited from that had that happened.  But, yeah, I was popular.  I got--started driving when I was fifteen years of age, I--'cause I put my age up.  My father helped me lie to the, to the driving guy down--the first time I went down, he says, "Boy, you're not old enough."  So, I came back in like two weeks and he said, "Okay."  And he let me take the road test, which I passed.  I knew how to drive.
Speaker 1: So they didn't ask you for--now, today, they'd ask you to see a document or something.
Speaker 2: They didn't.
Speaker 1: They didn't have any.
Speaker 2: No, no, he just took my word for it.  And I gave him my age, which I was born in 1932 and it was, it was after I got to--it may have been when I got to, after I moved to Detroit [Michigan] that I actually changed my age to reflect my true age on my, on my driver's license.  Up until that time, it was always, what a year older than I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, you know, they didn't--it seems amazing now that you could walk up someplace and just tell them.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right (laughter), yeah.  But everybody in my hometown knew everybody.  He knew who I was.  He knew my father and, you know, and I never had any accidents to speak of.  I've always been a great driver, you know.  I consider myself a really good driver and that's the end of the story.  I drove a school bus while I was in high school 'cause kids drove the school buses back in those days.  I don't know if they still do that now or not, but--
Speaker 1: The kids drove the, drove--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I drove the school bus loaded with kids and I was sixteen years of age.
Speaker 1: That seems amazing now that they would--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --let--a sixteen year old would have--but, you--there wasn't as much traffic I would guess and just--
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't.  But you had responsibility that you, you went away to school, they taught you certain things about driving and you had to show--and you didn't have automatic transmissions.  You had to shift with a clutch.  And you'd go down these country roads.  There were black buses for the black kids and then the white buses.  And the white kids had the newer buses.  And so I remember this guy would all--they had governors on them.  You couldn't drive them more than about thirty-five miles an hour, but he had passed me.  And once I remember on a muddy--these roads were not paved, and he had put the bus in the ditch, and I drove by him and I--but that made me even more determined that I was never gonna have an accident.  I was never gonna put a bus in the ditch.  So, but, you know, how white kids are.  They kind of horse around and race and do all those kinds of things, and I never did any of that.
Speaker 1: We really couldn't afford to do that, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I mean, I didn't want to bring any disrespect on myself or my family or whatever, so I never had any, any problems in driving a school bus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, that--I heard another story about someone who was telling me about driving the school bus (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I earned, I earned a dollar a day, twenty dollars a month.  That was a big deal, though in 1949 and '50 [1950] when I was driving the school bus.  I went out for the football team and I was pretty fast at running back and I would've made the team except that Dorrie--Dorrie Medley [ph.] was a better football player than I and it was between he and I to drive the school buses, so (laughter) I drove the bus and he played football.
Speaker 1: So you got, you got paid and he didn't.
Story_ID: 624014
Speaker 1: Now did your father [Frederick Douglas, Sr.]--as a principal of a small, of a school [Hamlet Avenue School] in a small town like that [Hamlet, North Carolina], did he have to do a lot of public speaking and--?
Speaker 2: I don't recall my father ever doing any public speaking.  Mr. Mask, the high school principal, probably did a lot more of that.  My father was not, he was kind of an introvert like I am.  He loved to sing.  He sang solos and he sang in the choir at our church.  And he liked to help people.  He used to take people to Florence, South Carolina, which is about sixty miles away because of the dental clinic down there.  And people could down in the morning and have their teeth taken out and come home with a plate in the evening (laughter), you know.  I don't know how people did that in those days, but that's what they used--and he'd take them down there.  Sometimes he'd--I remember there's a cousin of mine, Geri [ph.], she--her sister would be my father's first cousin and she wasn't a very good mother, turned out to be an alcoholic.  But my father took a shine to this young girl and had her teeth fixed when she was a--when--was like a teenager at his own expense.  That's--those are the kinds of things he did.  He, and he loved to go to funerals.  In a small town, that's about the biggest thing that happened on Sun- and it's--funerals were saved to Sunday afternoon.  That's when they had the funeral and he was always there.  He liked to go to funerals.  But, that was the event of the week, I guess, you know.
Speaker 1: Now was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: It was.  We were Methodist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: United Methodist is what it's called now, but back then, the whole North Carolina area where I grew up is--was principally settled by the Scottish and so that was the Methodist heritage.  And my mother's [Inez Highland Douglas] family were Methodist and my father's family were all Methodist.  He--his church, his home church was Aaron's Temple, A-R- A-A-R-O-N, Aaron's Temple [Aaron Temple United Methodist Church, Bennettsville, South Carolina] and hers was Clio Methodist Church [Clio United Methodist Church, Clio, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: How do you spell that one?
Speaker 2: C-L-I-O.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Clio is a little town outside of McColl, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, but the--they, they considered these their home churches?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But, did--well, neither one of these are in--
Speaker 2: No, in Hamlet [North Carolina]--
Speaker 1: --Hamlet.
Speaker 2: --it was St. Peter's Methodist Church [St. Peter's United Methodist Church, Hamlet, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: St. Peter's, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, St. Peter's.
Speaker 1: It's interesting that people had a loyalty to the church they grew up in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and would consider their home church.
Speaker 2: I'm still a Methodist.  My wife [Retha Hughes Douglas] is an A.M.E. Methodist [African Methodist Episcopal], but she joined my church, you know, so we continue to be Methodist.
Speaker 1: And which, which one do you go to now?
Speaker 2: Here in Detroit [Michigan] when we go, we go to Central Methodist Church [Central United Methodist Church] downtown, which is a left wing liberal church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The first Protestant church in Michigan is what it is or was.  But we joined when we first came to Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Did you have any special role in the church in growing up?  Now which one did you--you went to St. Peter's most--
Speaker 2: St. Peter's.
Speaker 1: --of the time, right?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you have any special roles there as a youth when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, just went to Sunday school, was a--one of the kings at Christmastime in the Christmas pageant, but that's it.  And, you know, they'd have oratorical contests for Easter where you'd get up and say those speeches.  I participated in all of that.  There may have been some youth groups, bible study during the summertime.  We'd eventually--from time--occasionally, we'd go to the beach, Myrtle Beach down in South Carolina.  There was a black beach down there called Atlanta--Atlantic Beach [South Carolina].  It's now fully encased now by Myrtle Beach, but it used to stand out as a black beach.  And there was a fence that literally ran right through the beach down into the ocean, and on one side was Myrtle Beach for whites and on the other side was Atlantic Beach for blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I wonder how they kept the water flowing (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) That's right.
Story_ID: 624015
Speaker 1: So, now what were your aspirations in high school [Capital Highway High School, Detroit, Michigan]?  What did you want to be when you--
Speaker 2: You know, I, I was never quite sure.  I knew that I was going to college from a young age because my parents [Inez Highland Douglas and Frederick Douglas, Sr.] just told me that, "You all are going to college, we are going to prepare for it and you're gonna go."  And I remember once--one day my father was talking to a farm hand.  As I mentioned, we had this farm and they called my father Fess, F-E-S-S.  "Fess, what's Walter [HistoryMaker Walter Douglas] gonna do when he grows up?"  And he says, "Oh, I don't know, he's probably going to go into business."  And that just kind of stuck with me.  I said, "Well, you know, that makes some sense."  Interesting as a child, I always envisioned myself doing something and then I, if I would envision myself in a situation--I saw myself sitting behind the desk rather than in front of it.  So it kind of made--yeah, that makes sense.  That's something I'd like to do.  So when I got to North Carolina Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], I majored in what was then called commerce.  It was a curriculum that had some accounting courses, typing and shorthand and business law, and business principles, principles of business.  But no one was targeted to go into the private sector back then.  With those skills, if you could type and take shorthand, you could likely go to Washington, D.C. and become some kind of a government clerk.  And, and that's what most people are doing in the era that I grew up.

Speaker 1: Now, when did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in 1950.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty [1950].  And that's from?
Speaker 2: Capital Highway.
Speaker 1: Capital Highway High School [Hamlet, North Carolina].  Okay.  Now, now how did you choose North Carolina Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] as a school?
Speaker 2: Well, my br- my older brother [Frederick Douglas, Jr.] was already there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Somehow he had chosen North Carolina Central.  I remember our St. Peter's [St. Peter's United Methodist Church, Hamlet, North Carolina]  pastor suggesting to my parents [Inez Highland Douglas and Frederick Douglas, Sr.] that I might want to consider Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University] in Atlanta [Georgia].  I hadn't, I didn't, I didn't initiate very much about this.  And my mother said, "Well, I don't know," and, and I said, "Well, I think I'd like to go to North Carolina Central where my brother is" because he'd come home and he'd talk about all the fascinating things that he was doing there and, and I chose North Carolina Central.
Story_ID: 624017
Speaker 1: Now I didn't ask you about this earlier, but, but your brother [Frederick Douglas, Jr.] is just slightly older than you.
Speaker 2: He's three years older.
Speaker 1: Three--yeah, three years older.  And were, were you all very close coming up and--
Speaker 2: We were.  We shared work chores.  He was a lot more aggressive than I, but we had a cow.  We had hogs to feed and all that kind of stuff.  But I never learned to milk the cow.  He did and that became his responsibility.  I just--it was something I just wasn't going to do.  I was, I was kind of stubborn.  There were things that I wouldn't do and my parents [Inez Highland Douglas and Frederick Douglas, Sr.] couldn't get me to do them, and I never learned how to milk the cow, so--but he did that.  But, yeah, as he, as we got older, we did lots of things together, in fact did a little bit of dating.  He was older than I, but I'd tag along with him, you know, when he, when he would go out places, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  'Cause you were describing earlier some of the pressure on you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --being the son of a--
Speaker 2: He was--
Speaker 1: --principal.
Speaker 2: He was--he had a lot of innate skills, but he had some inhibitions.  He graduated valedictorian with his class in high school [Capital Highway High School, Hamlet, North Carolina].  He was going to go away to become a doctor, majored in chemistry in undergraduate school never missed a day of school in his life in high school.  He had a perfect attendance record every year and all of us had a lot of them because my father insisted upon it.  But he never missed a day in school in twelve years of school, which I think is a phenomenal record for any kid.  But he went away to college, majored in chemistry, did well, never had any problem with his grades, but he just had a, he had an innate inability to finish things.  You know, there are some people who are like that and he was just one of those, so--
Speaker 1: So he didn't really--
Speaker 2: He went to--he--in college, we were both at Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] for the same, at the same time, I a freshman, he was a senior.  He graduated and then during my sophomore year, he came back to graduate school because that was another stipulation my father had.  He says, "I want you to finish graduate--get your master's degree before you ever leave."  Well, that was during the Korean War and my brother was drafted during his first year of graduate school.  And then he went to Korea for two years.  By the time he came back, I had graduated and I, too, was in graduate school.  So the both of us were in graduate school at the same time even though he had started earlier before going to Korea and coming back.  I completed my graduate work, he didn't.  Okay, so he--but after that, after studying for a year, he just never wrote his thesis.  I think he did everything else.  We both left and he began to teach college.  He taught at Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina, which is an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] school, and I at the same time taught at Edward Waters junior college [Edward Waters College] in Jacksonville, Florida, which is an A.M.E. school.  But we shared a lot of time at North Carolina Central together.  He didn't manage his money nearly as well as I.  I used to work in the dining hall and had some money.  My father gave me a typewriter for graduating from high school and my brother pawned my typewriter and would always continue to lie about where it was and whatever.  I never got it back.  But that was just a little bit of his character.  You know, he was just kind of--when he got out of the [U.S.] Army, he bought a car.  My father cosigned for him.  And he was getting his VA money [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] and everything else, but he never paid the bills.  So the guy was always calling my father threatening to come pick the car up, but my father would pay for it, you know, and he continued to have the car.  But that was just, that was just a part of his personality.  I never knew growing up because I looked up to him as my older brother, smarter, a male version of my mother which was a light skin handsome guy and the girls all loved him, and here I was, this little runty guy who lived in his shadow.  But as I got older, I began to observe characteristics about his personality that eventually led to--he became an alcoholic after years.  He retired from the, from the federal government at a, as a pretty high grade.  He was smart, but, but died as an alcoholic at fifty-nine years of age.

Speaker 1: Describe North Carolina Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] for us.  What was--
Speaker 2: North, North Carolina Central was, was really kind of considered the flagship liberal arts college during the '50s [1950s], but because it was state supported, it was the first state supported black institution in the United States, and that's part of the legacy of what North Carolina has always been.  The State of North Carolina has always been a hotbed for educational institutions.  There are more black colleges [HBCus] in North Carolina than any other state in the union.  And North Carolina Central was the flagship.  It was called North Carolina College back in those days.  But it had a phenomenal teaching staff, most of whom were black, but it did have a few Caucasian instructors.  It was an inclusive sort of an environment.  There was still the fringes of color discrimination like in all black institutions during that time and perhaps some now.  You've heard of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], that if you weren't (unclear), you couldn't get into the colleges or if you got in, you weren't, you weren't favored.  You didn't see a lot of that at North Carolina Central.  And we had a lot of pride as an institution because our president, Alfonso Elder at the time who had taken over from Dr. James E. Shepard in 1947 when he passed away--James E. Shepard was the founder--kind of encouraged us to think well of ourselves and as I said, we had some firebrand professors, Dr. Helen Edmonds [Helen G. Edmonds], was one of them.  She was a history professor and she had given us--she subsequent to my being there gave a second in speech to Eisenhower's [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] re-nomination as president in 1956, so you could watch--look on TV and see one of your professors doing something like--former professors.  We had great athletes.  John McLendon was our basketball coach.  He--of Naismith fame.  He had learned basketball from the founder, Naismith [James Naismith], back in the early 1900s.  He eventually coached the Cleveland Ca- some team in Cleveland [Cleveland Pipers] before his--he died later on, a professional basket- NBA [National Basketball Association] team.  We were perennial champions in the N-C- CIAA [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association].  Our football team was great and we had people who went on to the NFL [National Football League].  Ernie Warlick was probably one of the first, played for the Buffalo Bills.  Sam Jones was a basketball player.  He was in the class right behind me.
Speaker 1: He had the best shot in the NBA.
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he grew up in Laurinburg, North Carolina, so I've known him even from high school [Capital Highway High School, Hamlet, North Carolina].  We used to play against him and they used to kill us (laughter) and it was Sam all by himself.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Tex Ha- Tex Harris [Charles Tex Harrison] from, from Houston, Texas, was my classmate and he played with the Harlem Globetrotters.  Lee Calhoun, I think he won three or four gold medals in 1960, six gold medals--
Speaker 1: In the Olympic Games, right?
Speaker 2: In the Olympics Game--
Speaker 1: In Rome, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then he, then he taught and was the athletic director at Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut].  LeRoy Walker [LeRoy T. Walker] was our track coach and he coached Lee Calhoun.  He eventually became president of the United States Olympic commission [United States Olympic Committee] and was a dear friend of mine.  But he was there during that time.  So North Carolina Central was a premier institution that was, that was just good across the board.  There were good academics. We had good professors, sports, and national recognition in many, many regards.  And this was in a period when few blacks got much recognition or felt a part of anything.  And, but being at North Carolina Central, I began to feel a part of something bigger than myself.  And when I, by the time I left, I had really matured quite a bit.  I majored in accounting.  Then my graduate degree was in business administration.  And I felt somewhat ready to participate in the world of commerce, in the world of, in the business arena, so to speak.  But then I went, I went from there to Edward Waters junior college in Florida [Edward Waters College, Jacksonville, Florida].
Story_ID: 624019
Speaker 1: Now just to go back a little bit to college [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].  Now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did, did you join any fraternities or--
Speaker 2: I, I became an Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because my brother [Frederick Douglas, Jr.] was an Omega (laughter) and there's a paddle over there on the floor that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, so you were an Omega and did you run for any class offices?
Speaker 2: I was the vice president of my junior class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, well, you were there from--
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950]--
Speaker 1: Fifty [1950] to fifty--
Speaker 2: --to 1955.
Speaker 1: --fifty-five [1955], okay.
Speaker 2: Five school terms.
Speaker 1: Now was there much discussion on--now this is a time of a lot of transition in American life of black people.  I mean, things are starting to change a little bit.  The '54 [1954] Supreme Court decision, Brown versus the Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That--
Speaker 1: --implemented, but it was--
Speaker 2: That happened just before I graduated undergraduate school.  And there used to be a talk radio show and I remember that May, that evening listening to the radio.  It was just hotbed, you know, whites calling in, a few blacks would call in.  But we would tune into the station to just kind of hear what was going on.
Speaker 1: You want to know what white people were talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  It was, it was this is the worst thing that could ever possibly have happened to this country, you know.  I--we don't know what's gonna happen now and that kind of thing.  Then, that same year, my friend, Calvin [ph.], who had gone to high school [Capital Highway High School, Hamlet, North Carolina] with me but also was in college and whose home I had lived at way back when when I first went to Washington, D.C., and Lakeland, Maryland [College Park, Maryland].  He and I went to Atlantic City [New Jersey] to work that summer.  And so I rode the bus probably up to D.C. and then met him.  And I remember going into the bus terminal downtown Washington, D.C., and sitting at the counter, and just pushing the envelope a little bit, but the lady finally came over and waited on us.  We had bought a drink.  We had a drink and then rode the bus to, to Atlantic City.  But things were changing.  You could just sense that things were changing.
Story_ID: 624020
Speaker 1: Did you teach accounting at Edward Waters [Edward Waters College, Jacksonville, Florida]?
Speaker 2: I taught, I taught accounting, I taught shorthand, I taught typing, and I taught business law and principles of business.  One of my students there was Hank Aaron's sister, Gloria Edmonds--Gloria Aar- Gloria Aaron.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Edward Waters, I think according to the note I have here is it achieved accreditation as a junior college in '55 [1955].  Were you there for that transition or had it happened--
Speaker 2: I think it had just happened when I got there.  I got there in September of 1955.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so Edward Waters.  So you were there--it's the oldest historically black college [HBCU] in Florida.  Well, it says 1866, founded--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in 1866.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, but you were drafted not long after you started--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --teaching.
Speaker 2: --I taught that full school year.  Then, my college professor, the only CPA [certified public accountant] I'd ever met--black CPA I'd ever met in my life, Dr. Lincoln Harrison, recommended me for a position at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  Their business department really only had one individual and he taught all the business courses, and he had been terminated for some reason and I was recruited to replace him on the, on the strength of Dr. Harrison's recommendation.  So at the end of the school year in 1956, I resigned from Edward Waters and began teaching at Tuskegee Institute during the summer, I taught the summer curriculum that year, typing, principles of business and accounting.  But, while I was at Tuskegee, I got my (unclear) from the United States Army.  And so, Dr. Fuller [Joseph E. Fuller], who was the, the dean of the, of the general studies department was outraged because here he was, the school year was about to start, and he didn't have anybody to teach.  So, but I left.  But before, but while I was there, I remember going over to the library and noting that there were almost no books in the library at Tuskegee Institute on business courses.  And so the librarian and I sat down and ordered any number of books.  She said, "I'm so glad to see you.  You can help me do something that I've wanted to do," and we--you know, we subscribe to several magazines like Fortune and Businessweek and some basic stuff that the kids could then read in the library because there was not any of that.
Speaker 1: Now, that--that's really seems strange, you know, with a--the practical approach that Booker T. Washington took to, you know, education, you know, when he started the Tuskegee Institute years and years ago, you know--I mean, before you got there that he would have no business stuff, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The--I mean, they had the, they had the curriculum, which was typing and shorthand, accounting, principles of business, and business law.  Those are the basic courses I think most of the black colleges and--but to back it up with a subscription to The Wall Street Journal, for example, to back it up with a subscription to Fortune magazine back at that point in time, that--
Speaker 1: So, did you think that their--I mean, the view of black business at Tuskegee was kind of a parochial, kind of a small vision?
Speaker 2: I think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't think people just--there was not much of a belief that there were any opportunities for young black students to achieve in business.  I remember meeting a gentleman at North Carolina Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] who majored in economics.  I said, "Why in the world would you major in economics?"  You know, "How do you get a job in economics?"  I mean, but, there was just--the linkages just weren't there and there was no one to encourage us or to teach us to draw the lines.  And that's one of the things I had to, I had to figure out myself, is how to draw the lines between--even accounting and an opportunity in business or business law and an opportunity to use that in some real way.  The linkages weren't, just weren't there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting.  That's a, that's--okay.  Even at Tuskegee.  And I have to think why--Booker T. founded the, the National Negro Business League or something when he was--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --at the turn of the century--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but still didn't have a fix on--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 624021
Speaker 1: So, so you were drafted then, and--
Speaker 2: I was drafted to the United States Army that summer, also gave my wife [Retha Hughes Douglas] an engagement ring.  I had saved all year for that and went to--she graduated from North Carolina Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] that spring, and she went to New York and I went to Fort Jackson, South Carolina [Fort Jackson, Columbia, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1957?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty--
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958]?
Speaker 2: --six [1956].
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956].  Okay, so you ended up at Fort Jackson.
Speaker 2: On Tank Hill (laughter).  That's where they train, they train all the recruits.  Interesting thing, my brother [Frederick Douglas, Jr.] who was now married and living in Columbia, South Carolina, with his wife, Estelle [ph.], used to come out and see me while I was at basic training there 'cause he lived right there, but I couldn't go off base, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how were you deployed?
Speaker 2: Well, the second day, or the first day, we were on--standing in formation and the captain stood up and says, "We need somebody who can type.  Is there anybody out there who can type?"  And while I didn't--being the introvert that I am, I said to the guy next to me, I said, "I can type, I can type 100 words a minute."  So, he says, "Sir, there's a guy over here who can type."  And I became the company clerk.  The company clerk who they had was some guy named--I can't remember, some white kid, and he always got the morning reports all screwed up.  But when I got there, I figured out how to do the morning report and do it neat and account for all the personnel accurately, and so battalion got off the captain's back.  And so then he tried to get me to stay there.  He says, "Son, why don't you just stay right here and be my company clerk?"  But, you know, I wanted to see the world.  I--my brother had been in the Army.  He had been to Korea and he'd talk about all these beautiful Japanese girls that they would see on R and R [rest and relaxation] and I said, "That's what I want to do.  I want to go to Japan."  Well, I finished basic training in eight weeks and because I had a graduate degree, they put me into this special program called scientific and professional.  And they said, "Well, now we don't have a class A assignment for you," and I don't think the Army was racist, but I didn't get a class A assignment, I got a class B assignment.  And my class B assignment sent me to Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  Well, when I got there, I also continued to be the company clerk, the personnel officer, so to speak, for my outfit, which is a Redstone missile outfit.  We made liquid oxygen for the Redstone missile, which was the prominent missile that Wernher von Braun had devised for us and was going to be deployed in Europe.  So I was there at Fort Belvoir from October of '56 [1956] until the next July.  Then, I got a class A assignment.  They transferred me from Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to Walter Reed Army Medical Center [Walter Reed National Military Medical Center], which is in downtown Detroit [Michigan]--downtown Washington, D.C., actually Northwest Washington, D.C.  And so, with this class A assignment, I moved from Fort Belvoir, got--rode the bus, put--took my duffle bag and got on the bus and rode over to Walter Reed.
Story_ID: 624022
Speaker 1: There, I met some of the most prominent individuals in the U.S. Army that you could imagine.  I was thrust right into mostly white gentleman, but there were some blacks as well, all S and P people, scientific and professional.  One was Dick Spangler [Clemmie Spangler, Jr.].  He had gone to Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], gone--graduated from the University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  After graduate, after getting out of the Army went back to North Carolina and created banking, created the banking center in North Carolina in Charlotte [North Carolina], where his father [Clemmie Spangler, Sr.] had been a construction--owned a construction company.  But Dick Spangler then went on to become president of the University of North Carolina higher education system.  He was a very prominent--probably one of the most prominent citizens in Charlotte.  He was, he and I were in the Army at Walter Reed together.  There was another guy, Joe Berger [Joseph Berger], who had grown up in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and went to University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] graduate school.  And another guy, Ken Ackerman, who had grown up in Lima, Ohio, and his father, his family owned a big trucking company.  He was also a Harvard graduate.  And another gentleman, Donald Gray, who had gone to Valparaiso Law School [Valparaiso University School of Law, Valparaiso, Indiana] and hadn't completed it, but had gotten drafted.  So they and some other--Carlton Hodges [ph.] whose father--black guy who--from Harlem [New York, New York], his father had been a doctor who was deceased, but he was going to go to medical school.  And a guy named James Sparks [ph.] from Texas, he eventually went to Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.]--Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  But all these folks were in this same--the S and P program because we had advanced degrees.  And we used to have lunch together in the cafeteria and I would sit and watch these guys talk about the business world and all the rest of it.  Well, you know, I had learned a lot because when I was in college, I used to read Fortune magazine and Businessweek and that kind of stuff because it kind of interested me, but yet I just hadn't developed the linkage to what it would be like to be in the business world.  But I listened to these guys and the words and the company names and all the rest of it that I would hear them talk about, it was all just fascinating to me.  Well, we roll along and it's about time to get out of the Army, and they all knew exactly what they wanted to do.  Dick Spangler says, "Walter [HistoryMaker Walter Douglas], you ought to come back to North Carolina and get into banking.  You know, there's not a colored banker in Charlotte."  Well, I didn't know how to draw the line, say, "What would I do first if I wanted to get into banking?"  You know, I just didn't--but, he did.  He went back to North Carolina and got into banking.  The other guy says, "Well, you know, I'm just gonna walk down Wall Street and knock on doors and, and I'm sure they'll recruit me."  So, I'd say, "Well, I'm gonna start--I'm gonna write some letters to some of these companies."  I, I wanted to be a CPA [certified public accountant].  I had majored in accounting.  I wrote to various accounting firms and various businesses.  I got not a single response, not--in one instance, a company sent me my letter back with a note written on it, not interested.  So, that's kind of how--they got out of the Army and they had some place to go.  I started selling vacuum cleaners when I got out of the Army.
Story_ID: 624023
Speaker 1: Now did you consider going back to teaching?  Was that an option?
Speaker 2: Well, I could've gone back to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  I even wrote Dr. Fuller [Joseph E. Fuller] and he says, "Yes, you can come back at the same salary," $3800 a year, which is what they paid me, but--which--that was a step up from Edward Waters [Edward Waters College, Jacksonville, Florida] where I was making $2900 a year.  But I was now married and living in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and my wife [Retha Hughes Douglas] was working for the Bureau of Standards [National Bureau of Standards; National Institute of Standards and Technology], and I said, "I'm not gonna go back to Tuskegee."
Speaker 1: So now this is like--okay.  This is about 19--
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958] is when I got out.
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958], okay.
Speaker 2: There was a little recession.  Even the government wasn't hiring very much.  But I got out and started selling vacuum cleaners, did that for about ninety days or so.
Speaker 1: Were those the Kirby vacuum cleaners?
Speaker 2: Kirby, Kirby vacuum cleaners.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right, door to door, that's exactly right.  And that helped me, quite frankly, because it helped me generate some salesman's, a salesman's pitch.  I began to, you know, articulate how to sell these vacuum cleaners.  I finally got an opportunity to go to work for the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] as a grade three clerk.  At my, at my--we lived with this doctor, Dr. Carr [ph.].  He was blinded.  He had been blinded by glaucoma.  But he knew of my interest in business, and so one day, he took me over to visit a gentleman and I--who went to my same church.  And I can't remember his name but, anyway, he was a caterer and had an interface with some judges at the IRS, judges that heard tax cases.  And he, and he took me over to meet him one Sunday and says, "I want you to give him your resume to see if he can get you into the IRS" because that's the way you did it then.  You got somebody who worked for white folks and they'd take your resume through the kitchen to give it to these people and they would give you consideration.  I never heard from any of these judges in the IRS, so I went down there eventually myself and got a job as a grade three clerk.
Speaker 1: Now, let me--let me go back a little bit and--now, did you sell vacuum cleaners from '58 [1958] up until six--now, you started--
Speaker 2: No, I--
Speaker 1: --with the IRS--
Speaker 2: --I sold--
Speaker 1: --in '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: I--no, I started with the IRS in 1959.
Speaker 1: Fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Well, they've got--all right, they've got it--
Speaker 2: Okay.  As a--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: As a clerk, GS-3 clerk.  So, for about ninety to 120 days, I sold vacuum cleaners after I got out of the [U.S.] Army.  I got out of the Army in August of 1958 and from then until January, that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause they--when they're doing the research, there was a gap here, but the gap is really not a gap because now we know you were working with the IRS.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I started to work for the IRS in the International Operations Division.  And that gave me access to looking at tax returns of movie stars and other Americans that lived overseas.  And at that time, if you stayed outside of the country 518 days, you didn't have to pay any federal taxes to the United States.  And you would look at some of these movies stars and I would see these huge salaries that they were making and amounts of money, three, four hundred thousand dollars, I said, "Boy, I can't believe all that."  And I even looked up Dick Spangler's [Clemmie Spangler, Jr.] tax return, his father's company, and the construction company in North Carolina, and they had lost money that year, but the--I didn't have sense enough to know that if a business loses money, they don't necessarily lose money (laughter).  But, still, I was learning.  That spring, I decided to take the Federal Service Entrance Examination.  That was an examination that if you took it and passed, your name then got on a register that made you eligible for all kinds of professional positions.
Story_ID: 624024
Speaker 1: So you had a chance to look through everybody's tax returns that were--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You--
Speaker 2: --the--
Speaker 1: --you applied to--I'm sorry, we, we had you applying to another--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--oh, yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --position.  All right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: I took the Federal Service Entrance Examination and passed it, which then put my name on a roster of eligible professional college graduates who could seek any number of entry level professional positions within the federal government.  And one day while as a clerk in the IRS [Internal Revenue Service], I went down and looked on the bulletin board in front of the personnel office, and they had a job described as digital computer programmer, GS-5/7.  And I read the requirements and so I said, "I think I'm eligible for that."  So I went in and there was this great big buxom blonde English woman sitting there, and I had my resume with me and I asked her, I said, "I think I'm eligible for this position."  And she says, "Well, let me see."  And she looked at it and she says, "No, I don't think you are."  So, I concluded that she was just being racist.  So I waited until she went to lunch.  Then I went back and asked another personnel clerk and she says, "I think you are," and I got an interview that very same afternoon.
Speaker 1: Now this story says something about you knowing the, how the government works from being there long enough to know that one clerk might tell you one thing but somebody else--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --is going to tell you something else.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And you--
Speaker 2: I went back and I got an interview that same afternoon with George Campbell [ph.] and a guy by the name of McInerney [ph.], and he always smoked cigars, and I was hired and--out of that clerk's position and into a GS-5 digital computer programmer starting position probably within three weeks.
Speaker 1: Now, this is--what year is this?  This is--
Speaker 2: This would've been 19--probably 1959, that same year that I--
Speaker 1: Okay, the same year you started with the IRS.
Speaker 2: Right, but later in the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I immediately went in, went to the Statistics of Income Division.  This was the division within the IRS that published statistics on income and they needed to compile and collate tax return data to publish these statistics.  And at that time, the IRS didn't own a computer, did not own a single digital computer.  They owned some IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] processor machines, but they were renting computer time from the bureau of the census [U.S. Census Bureau], and the bureau of the census had UNIVAC 1 and UNIVAC 13 computer systems that they had purchased to do the decennial census in 1950.
Story_ID: 624025
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe for the sake of history 'cause a lot of young people are not going to be able to relate to what a UNIVAC [universal automatic computer] is.
Speaker 2: A UNIVAC is a, is a vacuum tube computer that would fill up a room, a room that is twenty by twenty [feet] with huge tape handling machines and a central processor and a large console with lots of lights and things, and the console itself was probably about six feet long and three feet high, and a guy sat there and worked the various lights in order to make the system work.  The computer itself had a thousand words of memory.  Now a word of a memory is, characters of memory.  It had twelve, it had ten--twelve digit words.  In other words, you could have twelve characters in a word and then you had a thousand of those, so you had twelve thousand characters of information that this computer could process at one point in time.  So you had to use some of it for your program that would direct the system what to do, and the rest of it would be your data that you would do--you would manipulate.  You had these ten tape reels, these ten tape machines that could--and the reels themselves were about twelve inches in diameter and they were all metallic.  This was not plastic, but metallic at the time.  We eventually began to use--
Speaker 1: Metallic tape?
Speaker 2: We began to use met- plastic tape, but then we were using metallic tape.  And you could actually pour something like mercury on them and you could see the digits of the information on them, on the, on the tape itself, so you could read it right off the tape.  But that's what it was like.  It was slow, cumbersome, but yet at the same time, in 1950, it was quite sophisticated.
Speaker 1: It was faster than--
Speaker 2: Faster than anything a human being had ever known.  You could look in the manuals and see that you could do, this machine could do like an addition in a certain number of milliseconds.  A millisecond is a thousandths of a second.  Well, that was--I mean, by today's standards--I read something the other day about the fastest computer in the world or the second fast that China has now developed and the technology is something I haven't even kept track of how many more manipulations you can do, addition, subtractions, divisions.  And when you, if you had a program that was dividing a number--the way the computer actually divided was it took, say you've got four--you want to divide two into four, you div- you kept subtracting two from four and counting the number of times it took you.  That's how you divided with a computer.  So it was like things would just stop in space when you had to do a division because it subtracted.  Two from four, one time, two from four again, two times, is there anything left?  No, it's zero, so two goes into four two times.  That's the way the computer actually did calculations.  The Census Bureau got another computer later, which was 1105 [UNIVAC 1105], which was faster, a year later or so.  They had, they had it when they--well, we weren't using it at that time.  As they prepared for the 1960 decennial census, they got more computers.  We were still renting time from them and I was singled out by my boss to go out and to learn how to use this newer computer because I was the best that he had.  I--turned out that I got to be phenomenal in, in data processing.  I was the best he had.  I went out and brought the knowledge back and wrote the most complex programs to get us started in 1961 or so.  And that's, that's the beginning of my career in data processing.
Story_ID: 624026
Speaker 1: The IRS in 1962 or so decided after--under John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] as president, that they were gonna revamp the, the Internal Revenue Service, so they wanted to build nine service centers.  There's current service centers that we have now.  We have one in Cincinnati [Ohio], and you have one in Kansas City [Missouri], and you have one in Atlanta [Georgia], and you have one in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  They wanted to build those, so they went to--before the Senate appropriations committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations] and asked McNamara [Patrick V. McNamara] to approve the money for the IRS to build these service centers around the United States, so this is what--you know, you're not gonna put one in Michigan?  So they hadn't thought about putting one in Michigan, so he says, "Well, I'll tell you what.  You come back before my appropriation committee when you give me some of those new jobs."
Speaker 2: Now, who was--was Romney [George W. Romney] associated with the--or any of the Michigan politicians associated with--
Speaker 1: Senator McNamara.
Speaker 2: McNamara.
Speaker 1: McNamara was the senator from the United--
Speaker 2: Oh, from the--
Speaker 1: --from Michigan.
Speaker 2: Okay, McNamara.
Speaker 1: But he was head of the appropriations committee.  So he--
Speaker 2: Oh, is this the same--this is Robert McNamara?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: This isn't--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: This isn't Robert.  This is--
Speaker 1: Unh-uh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause he'd be, he was with Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.] and then--
Speaker 1: Right.  He became secretary of defense.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But this is--
Speaker 2: This is another--when you said it--
Speaker 1: This is Senator Mc--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay, Senator McNamara.
Speaker 1: McNamara.  Then the IRS put their heads together and says, "Well, maybe what we could do is we could create a data center and locate it in downtown Detroit [Michigan]."  And so they went back to Senator McNamara and proposed in it that we still want to deploy these service centers, but we were going to give you a data center in Detroit.  And that data center transferred the functions that I was involved with in Washington, D.C., to Detroit, and so that's how I got to Detroit.  I came out here as the team leader for the corporate and partnership tax processing for statistics of income.
Speaker 2: This--is this--this is '62 [1962], then.
Speaker 1: This would've been '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965], okay
Speaker 1: But between '62 [1962] and six--the whole process started with the IRS starting to talk to McNamara in '62 [1962].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: By the time this whole thing evolved and they rolled out all the service centers that were built, being built, it took several years.  And so I wound up transferring to Detroit and we set up office in a downtown warehouse building on John R Street to--and opened the IRS data center.
Story_ID: 624027
Speaker 1: Now you were married by then, right?
Speaker 2: I married and had two children by the time we moved here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a daughter born in 1960.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And a son born in 1963.
Speaker 1: Now, you say you, you and your wife [Retha Hughes Douglas] met in graduate--at North Carolina--
Speaker 2: While I was in--
Speaker 1: --Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: --graduate school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --she was a junior.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So your whole family comes here.  And where did you live in the city when you moved?
Speaker 2: We moved here and we lived in a community called Green Acres, which was a mostly white area within the City of Detroit [Michigan] near the northern boundary of the city along Woodward Avenue.  When we moved into the area, there were fewer than fifteen black families in the area between Seven [Seven Mile Road] and Eight Mile Roads west of Woodward Avenue, between Woodward Avenue and Livernois Avenue.  There were two--three communities there.  There was Palmer Woods [Detroit, Michigan], there's Sherwood Forest [Detroit, Michigan], and Green Acres, and we lived in Green Acres, a nice colonial house that was about less than ten years old.  We loved it.  When we first moved in, we got some hate letters from our neighbors.  "What do you mean by moving into our neighborhood in the middle of the night," that kind--they said in the middle of the night and I don't, I don't ever know where that came from because a North American Van Line [North American Van Lines] truck showed up in front of our house at eight o'clock in the morning and unloaded furniture all day in daytime, so there was no sneaking in in the middle of the night.  But that was--
Speaker 1: But that was--
Speaker 2: --that was--
Speaker 1: That was the rumor then.
Speaker 2: That--and that's what the letter said.  That's--I wish I had kept that letter and I don't know--I guess it was one of those things that you just want to get rid of probably like my, my parents [Inez Highland Douglas and Frederick Douglas, Sr.] when they ran into their bad situations way back when, those were things you wanted to forget rather than, than embrace and save.
Story_ID: 624028
Speaker 1: How did you like Detroit [Michigan]?  And what was Detroit like for you in '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Well, I found it to be racist.  I found it to be exclusive.  I--we joined Central Methodist Church [Central United Methodist Church, Detroit, Michigan], but even some of the blacks there who were professionals were not open and friendly.  I mean, it was just, it was, it was a community of class and status, and not unlike D.C.  I mean, Washington, D.C. was the same kind of thing.  You would meet somebody in D.C. and they would say, "Well, hi, I'm Walt Douglas [HistoryMaker Walter Douglas], I'm a grade thirteen, what are you?"  And there was (laughter)--there was always this measuring of--I even had one of my neighbors--I was a GS-13 and she says, "Well, you know, my boss is a fifteen."  She was identifying with her boss rather than what, than what she was (laughter), you know.  So you found some of that in Detroit as well.  But we just hunkered down.  I protected my family.  I--we went to church every Sunday, did not know anybody except a few people who had moved out here with the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] data center.  So we all kind of hung together and--but over time, I started to gain some interest in other matters.  In my church, I took a more prominent role.  I became a trustee.  There were cults in the church.  I got involved in one of the cults, one called the Ecumenical Institute, which was kind of a--the '60s [1960s] was an era when people--sensitivity training was a big deal and you were supposed to be real and come out and express yourself, and this Ecumenical Institute was one of those things that says, "You gotta be real, you gotta affect the world around you by your realism," so I kind of liked that.  That kind of turned me on.  And so we started, we got involved in it.  And for a couple of years, that kind of captured my interest.  But then the riots came the next year.  We had been here almost a year to the date, a little over a year when the riots happened.
Speaker 1: Now I don't want to get past that be real training and stuff.  As--so the ecumenical groups, what do they mean by being real?  What--
Speaker 2: Being honest with your feelings, being totally transparent.  I'll give you an example of what--and there is some bad language in it, is that all right?
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: You--we would go to these ecumenical sessions.  They were religious based sessions, but they asked this guy to pray one night, a white gentleman.  This was, this was an interracial group.  And I'm sitting there with my friend, Tom Diggs, who had also moved out here with me and he says, "Lord, you've asked me to be real and you've asked me to be honest, and that's what I want to be.  And I still remember, remember the night my wife walked in on me when I was there with my male friend with my dick in my hand."  That's what people meant by being real and sens- I just--I was shocked (laughter), you know, that somebody would--but that was what people--they were coming out.  People were coming out.  That was just what people were beginning to do.
Story_ID: 624029
Speaker 1: Now this is something you would have never heard in North Carolina or--
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter), no.  I would nev- not have heard it any place.  I mean, the--but, but then, that, that made me decide that that wasn't what I wanted to do.  That wasn't what I wanted to be.  I didn't want to just be that.  I wanted to do something rather than to express something.  So I got involved in minority economic development.  A good friend of mine who is now deceased, Larry Doss [Lawrence Doss]--
Speaker 1: Now is this before the riot or after the riot?
Speaker 2: This is after the riot.
Speaker 1: Now--okay, well, would you tell--
Speaker 2: There was a lot of dialogue--
Speaker 1: --tell us about the riot and where you were.  Now you were out of town I think when the riot hit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was on my way back from Washington, D.C.  We--my wife [Retha Hughes Douglas] and kids and I had--it was in the summertime, so we had driv--
Speaker 1: It was 1967, right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967].  We had driven down for the weekend for some meetings that I had on Friday.  We left Thursday morning and I had my meetings on Friday, and my brother [Frederick Douglas, Jr.] was still living in D.C., so we partied hard for--Saturday evening.  I get up Sunday morning with a little bit of a hangover.  We start driving back to Detroit [Michigan].  And when we get to about Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], you could pick up WJR [WJR Radio, Detroit, Michigan], which is a fifty thousand watts radio station here.  And Ernie Watts was calling the baseball game for the Tigers [Detroit Tigers]--not Ernie--Ernie Harwell.  He just decide, he just died within the last month.  But Ernie was calling the game and he made some comment about seeing smoke in the distance.  And as we listened to the game and we got closer to Detroit, we heard a few more accounts that some disturbances were occurring, but I couldn't determine what they were.  But I had some assumptions because by now, I knew a little bit about the geography of the city and I just assumed that this stuff that was happening, this incidents that were happening probably were isolated, but they were on the east side because the east side was one of the poor areas of Detroit at the time, and I just assumed that's where they were.  And we came into Detroit.  We came up Telegraph Road, which is a western boundary and across Eight Mile [Road] to our house.  Our house is only like two blocks from the city limits at Eight Mile, so that's the way we came home.  So we know--we saw nothing in the city.  When we get out of our car, our neighbor, next door neighbors, Fran [Fran Mayland (ph.)] and Isidore Mayland [ph.] came out and says, "Did you know that there's a lot of stuff going on?"  I said, "Yeah, but we haven't seen any of it.  It's probably on the east side."  And we come in the house and we go to bed.  My mother [Inez Highland Douglas] calls me, she says, "How you guys doing?"  I said, "Oh, we just got back from Washington, D.C.  We're doing fine.  There's some things going on, but they're on the east side.  They're not troubling us."  We go to bed.  Now, again, I had been up the night before.  I was kind of hungover and driving all the way back, I was tired.  So the next morning, my phone rings about six o'clock and it's my boss, Vince Fanelli [ph.], at the data center.  He says, "Walt [HistoryMaker Walter Douglas], work is cancelled today because of what's going on."  It just occurred to me that maybe I need to get up and find out what's going on.  So, we turn on the natio- TV, and there we are on national news, Detroit is in flames.  I find out that the merchandise mart [Colonial Merchandise Mart, Detroit, Michigan] and several other buildings within a mile of our house had been burned to the ground, but because of the way we came in, we didn't see any of that.  So we got in our car and we drove around and the devastation was really quite revealing.
Story_ID: 624030
Speaker 1: I don't consider what happened in Detroit to be a riot.  I consider it to be a rebellion.  I consider it to be a flashpoint initiated by--it's--what's the guy, Howard [Howard Beale], whatever his name is, says, "I'm tired of it and I ain't gonna take it anymore."  I think that blacks all of a sudden in that hot July day said, "You know what?  I'm sick and tired of this bullshit and I'm not gonna take it anymore."  And the action was really a rebellion against all of the practices of racial treatment, racial denial that had gone on in the city, like all the other American cities for, for years.  And people just rebelled against it.  And I consider what happened to be a rebellion rather than a riot.  A riot generally happens when two races interface and, you know, there's a fight or something that goes on.  But, this was really a rebellion where the community just began to react.  Now did it get out of hand?  Yeah.  Did people destroy even black businesses?  Yes, they did all of that, but they just happened to be in the way of everything else that was going on.
Speaker 2: Now the initial cause was--they've written that the initial cause was a--
Speaker 1: The blind pig on--
Speaker 2: Yeah, like a--
Speaker 1: --on 12th Street.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was after hours joint--
Speaker 1: After hours joint, right.
Speaker 2: --and there was a, I think a celebration, a welcome home Vietnam vet [Vietnam War veteran] from Vietnam, a black one, and the police raided it or something?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And it became the spark that just set things off.  All kinds of things happened.  Forty-three people died.  The number that we used to use when I was at New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan] was $250 million in damage.  In today's dollars that would probably be a billion dollars.  But just hundreds of businesses were destroyed, burned or damaged or looted.
Speaker 2: Were they mostly, were they on--it was on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was, it was on, it was up and down Dexter Avenue, 12th Street, those were the principal areas.  But, as I said, on Livernois Avenue where we lived, the merchandise mart was burned to the ground, which was a convenience store like Home Depot would be now or something like that.  You had paint, and you can imagine what it sounded like with--I didn't hear it, but people described as the paint cans began to pop, it was just a huge kind of a fire.  But it was kind of all over.  And then the, in the wake of that initial disturbance, which took two or three days and the National Guard came in, my friend, Tom Diggs, the same guy who was sitting with me when the guy said that thing to his--who was making the prayer?  Tom was going home.  He lived right on Buena Vista [Street] right off Dexter Street [sic.], on the same street that one of The Supremes, Florence [Florence Ballard], lived, so he was gonna go up 12th Street.  This National Guard stops him and he says, "Where you going?"  He says, "Well, I'm going home."  He says, "Well you're not going up this way," and broke his nose with the butt of his rifle.  I mean, the--so that--that's what happened to my friend, Tom Diggs.
Speaker 2: Do you--it was because he was black--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --presumably, right?
Speaker 1: But he was black and he was going to go up 12th Street and the National Guard says you can't go up this street, get out of here, you know, broke his nose with his rifle, butt of his rifle.
Speaker 2: And he lived up that street?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Lived up that way.
Speaker 2: I take it that that didn't--
Speaker 1: There was no--nobody to appeal to.  You go to the hospital, you get your nose fixed, and you go home.  That--and that's what he did.
Story_ID: 624031
Speaker 1: That was a very interesting period.  The initial reaction was whites were just appalled that it could happen in Detroit [Michigan] where the UAW [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America; United Automobile Workers] and some of the other labor unions had, had really made a way for blacks to get off the bottom rung of America.  You know, there were foremen, there were some prominent people within the UAW ranks, Nelson "Jack" Edwards and Horace Sheffield and some others had emerged as leaders within the union, and everybody just kind of thought that it wouldn't happen here because of the liberal attitudes of the unions.  But everybody had forgotten that there were no whites [sic.] in Corporate America in this town to speak of back in those days, and no opportunities.  If you weren't a teacher or a lawyer or--
Speaker 2: No, no blacks in--
Speaker 1: No blacks.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But then, and then blacks got angry.  Blacks began to get angry after the disturbances.  And then dialogue occur, began to occur, and that was part of the dialogue that was going on at our church, at Central Methodist Church [Central United Methodist Church, Detroit, Michigan].  We used to have a Thursday luncheon group where everybody would come and bring a sandwich.  It was mostly males, every now and then a few females.  And I would go to these dialogue sessions and talk about the situation and what was going on.  Well, about a year later, we had another incident that happened and it's commonly referred to--it happened at Reverend Franklin's church [New Bethel Baptist Church, Detroit, Michigan] on Linwood Avenue [sic. Linwood Street].
Speaker 2: This is '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: This was, this would've been '68 [1968].  After--
Speaker 2: Is this before Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed or after?
Speaker 1: Yes, before Dr. King--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --was killed.  And I'm trying to think of the--the name of it was the--I'll just describe it and the name will come back to me.  This group was having an anniversary of the formation of this new organization, black organization [Republic of New Afrika], and in--and, it--they were having it at Reverend Franklin's church.  And as it was breaking up about midnight, several black individuals in fatigues were standing on the street outside of the church and police cars came by and they stopped them.  And they immediately fired on the police officers, killed one and injured another.
Story_ID: 624032
Speaker 1: It was called the New Bethel incident.  It happened at Reverend C.L. Franklin, Aretha Franklin's father's church.  But, they fired on the officers, the officers called for backup.  To make a long story short, in ten minutes or so, there were fifty or sixty police cars there.  Everybody retreated inside the church.  The police officers then went inside the church [New Bethel Baptist Church, Detroit, Michigan] and they claimed that even after they got inside the church, they were fired upon, but no one was injured.  They arrested everybody in the church, women, children, about a hundred and forty to fifty people, took them all down to the first precinct lockup.  Judge George Crockett [George Crockett, Jr.] had just become a judge in the City of Detroit and he heard about it.  Jimmy del Rio [James del Rio] who was a state representative called him.  He comes down and shows, and shows up and he sets up a court of habeas corpus, which says that if you're being charged, you must be properly brought before some legal body to determine your guilt or innocence.  And what George Crockett did is he dismissed everybody that the police had locked up.  Some people had even had paraffin put on their hands to determine if they had gun powder on them, but George Crockett's response to that was, well, because you can't be trusted, I can, I am not gonna give any serious consideration to any evidence that you put before me because I don't believe it's--it would stand up in a court of law, so he discharged everybody who was in jail.  That created an absolute firestorm in this community.  The media chose both sides of it.  Most people didn't know what a writ of habeas corpus was, but they soon found out.  George Crockett was really demeaned in the minds of an awful lot of people.  That Sunday--it happened on Saturday night, so that Sunday at church, several whites, liberals--this church I attend downtown is a liberal church, they resigned because of the hostile attitude of what was going on and they never came back to that church.  But then it just began to tear the community apart.  Meantime, just after the rebellion in '67 [1967 Detroit riot], there was a newspaper strike here in town.  We had no newspapers for like nine months.  From fall until the next spring, there were no newspapers, so there were all kinds of rumors and--of what was going on.
Speaker 2: So during this incident--now this incident at--
Speaker 1: The New Bethel.
Speaker 2: --at New Bethel.  I think--was that the Republic of New Afrika?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Republic of New Afrika.
Speaker 2: I know some of the people that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I think were in this.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And was there any reason for the, the shootout?  What happened?  Did they--
Speaker 1: The cops just--well, yeah.  The police--Detroit, Detroit police had a, had a reputation.  They rode around in what they call the Big Four, four police officers in a car and they were always a menacing presence when they showed up.  And their attitude was kick ass and take names.  So these brothers standing on the corner decided that when these two police officers stopped their police car, got out, they knew that there was gonna--'cause they had guns and they knew that something was gonna go down, so they just took action themselves, killed one officer and wounded another one, and that--that's what kicked it off.
Story_ID: 624033
Speaker 1: Tell us about the--we're gonna pause to create another section, but tell us about the orders of New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Well, the New Detroit was born within days of, of the 1967 disturbance slash riot.  Governor George Romney [George W. Romney] in conjunction with Mayor Jerome Cavanagh in the City of Detroit [Michigan] convened the business community and labor community, and some of the more prominent citizens, black and white, president of Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan], president of University of Detroit [University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan], and other institutions, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], et cetera, and to--talked about how this community might respond to this simple devastating situation that had just occurred, and decided to set up an organization called New Detroit, which would--they termed the urban coalition and they asked Joseph Frazier--Joseph Hudson [Joseph Lowthian Hudson, Jr.]--Joe Hudson to be the first chairman of the board.
Speaker 1: That's of Hudson department store [J.L. Hudson Company, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Of Hudson department store.  He was the CEO of Hudson department store.  He was thirty-three years of age.  And they con- they asked Bill Patrick [William T. Patrick, Jr.] who was a former city council- councilman, first black city councilman in the city, and who was currently working as an assistant vice president for Michigan Bell Telephone Company to be the first president.  So they set up this organization and then pledged to respond to all of the situations that had created this devastating and destructive event that had just occurred.  New Detroit was born.  It was the first urban coalition in America.  It happened right after--within days of that situation.  And then, this coalition began to programmatically address the ills of the city, unemployment.  Henry Ford II announced six hundred jobs at Ford Motor Company and the line on West Grand Boulevard where they had a recruitment office set up was blocks long as people came down to get those new jobs at Ford Motor Company that Henry Ford had set up.  There were other kinds of responses to community needs.  Organizations were funded.  New organizations were created.  The whole term community self-determination came into being where blacks began to say, "You know, don't tell us what's wrong with our community and what we need.  Let us figure out what our needs are and then you help us meet those needs."  So the whole term community self-determination came into being in conjunction with the formation of New Detroit.  At the same time, a minority organization, a black organization called ICBIF, the Inner City Business Improvement Forum, was formed by my friend, Larry Doss [Lawrence Doss], and Congressman Charlie Diggs [Charles Diggs].  They set up ICBIF, which was a minority self-determination economic development entity.  And it refused to speak directly to New Detroit because they felt that New Detroit wanted to be condescending to it, so there was a interface, a separate organization called the economic development corporation set up.  The economic development corporation talked to New Detroit on one hand and then talked to ICBIF on the other and it became a pass through for funds to get to ICBIF.  It was about this time that I got involved because Larry Doss [Lawrence Doss] who turned out to be my good friend worked for the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] also and I got to know him, and asked him if I could get involved, and that's when I turned away the Ecumenical Institute and what was going on in sensitivity training at Central Methodist Church [Central United Methodist Church, Detroit, Michigan] and began to apply my issues, my interest and initiatives in minority economic development and trying to create opportunities for blacks to get involved in business, and that's where I began to cut my teeth into stuff.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  We're resuming an interview we started on May the 7th--I mean, June the 7th.  It's now June the 9th [June 9, 2010] and, sir, we were talking about New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --nineteen seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you became part of--you joined New Detroit and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I joined New Detroit as a vice president in February of 1972.  Larry Doss [Lawrence Doss] was its second president.  He and I had met years earlier as we both were IRS [Internal Revenue Service] employees and got involved in a lot of non- non-paid work in the community, volunteers with ICBIF, the Inner City Business Improvement Forum.  We set up MESBIC, a minority enterprise small business investment company, to assist blacks with equity capital to go into business.  So after working for some period of time, Larry who had been with the IRS left, did a short stint with the Detroit Board of Education to decentralize the school system, then was invited to become the second president of New Detroit, and after several months, he invited me to join him.  I resigned my position as the assistant director of the IRS data center and joined New Detroit.  And as they say, the rest of the story begins to unfold from there.
Speaker 1: Okay so, Larry Doss took the place of Bill Patrick [William T. Patrick, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In New Detroit.
Story_ID: 624035
Speaker 1: I don't want to jump too far ahead, but one of the cardinal stories of the nation and, and certainly in Detroit [Michigan] is the election of Coleman Young as mayor of Detroit.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was--when did that come into view and--am I going too fast, you know--
Speaker 2: No.  In October of 1972, New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan] had a monthly board meeting and Larry [Lawrence Doss] announced the fact that he thought the time was beginning to emerge where a black could be elected as mayor of the City of Detroit.  And there were a lot of--there were not a lot of believers at that time.  I remember George Bushnell [George E. Bushnell] one of our prominent attorneys on the board.  He says, "Larry, there's no way.  The timing is not right."  But, yet that same year in November of 1972, in a special election, Erma Henderson was overwhelmingly elected to the Detroit City Council.  She became the black, the first black female.  We had had several males on the council before.  Bill Patrick [William T. Patrick, Jr.] had been one and Robert Tindal.  Robert Tindal died and Erma Henderson was replacing him.  So as people began to look at the results of that election, which at the same time was the year that Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] was elected, overwhelmingly reelected president in that November election.  People saw a pattern of voting in Detroit that--which suggested maybe the timing was right--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --for an African American to be elected mayor.
Speaker 1: Now what were the demographics then?  I mean we've long--I know I've long thought of Detroit as a black city and was that true in 1972--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: --in terms of the population?
Speaker 2: It was.  I don't recall the exact population, but Detroit was like a million five hundred thousand people in 1960, but by 1970, after the civil disturbances in 1967, a lot of whites, mostly Jews left northwest Detroit.  And, so the demographics began to be a lot more favorable toward blacks.  I believe we were probably in a majority.  We were getting to the point where Detroit would have been a, had a--would have become a black city--
Speaker 1: Who was the first--
Speaker 2: --by that time.
Speaker 1: Do you know who the first black city councilman was?
Speaker 2: I think it was Bill Patrick.
Speaker 1: Bill Patrick, okay.
Speaker 2: Bill Patrick.  That would've been some time in the '60s [1960s] followed by Robert Tindal, and then followed by Erma Henderson.
Story_ID: 624036
Speaker 1: A couple of other things were going on in that election in 1972.  When I first got to New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan], there was a proposed revision of the Detroit city charter that was put before the voters, and one of the principal elements in that revision was the way, the oversight given to the police department [Detroit Police Department] because of the big problems with policing in the City of Detroit [Michigan] from the time of the '67 [1967] disturbance, the New Bethel [New Bethel Baptist Church, Detroit, Michigan] incident, there was bad blood between the community and the police department.  So the first charter put before the voters in 1972, which I assisted in orchestrating.  There was a charter commission, but New Detroit was a prominent proponent of changes.  It was turned down.  It was turned down because the language, speaking to the police department was felt not to be strong enough.  The charter was gonna, was gonna make the mayor a strong mayor, but then there was not as much oversight of the police department.  So we spent 1972 rewriting that charter on the Ray Gribbs [Roman Gribbs] administration, he was the mayor, and then that spring, Coleman Young had filed a lawsuit, seeking permission to run for a local office, that local office being the mayor of the City of Detroit.  At the time, he was a state senator.  There--a provision in the Michigan Constitution [Constitution of the State of Michigan] prohibited state officials or state elected officials for running for local offices in their home district.  Coleman challenged that and in June of 1972, the Michigan Supreme Court overturned that provision, clearing the way for him to run for mayor.  He immediately set up a campaign.  He asked Bob Millender [Robert Millender]--Bob Millender was a prominent attorney in Detroit who had helped elect John Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.] to the U.S. Congress years earlier to be his campaign manager.  Larry Doss [Lawrence Doss] who was a close friend of Coleman's at this time and it, and had assisted him in a lawsuit with the state, invited me to accompany him to a meeting in Bob Millender's basement.  There was Georgia Brown who was a friend of Coleman Young's, there was Joyce Garrett [Joyce Finley Garrett] who was his lady.  He and Joyce Garrett dated.  Myself, Larry Doss, Nate Shapiro who was a Jewish engineer who had grown up in the streets in Black Bottom [Detroit, Michigan] with Coleman, and there may have been some other people that I don't recall, but we met and we began to talk about his campaign.  And we met every week as things were going close to the time when the UAW [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America; United Automobile Workers] would endorse Coleman.  And the night before the endorsement was to come out, we all just assumed that the UAW was going to endorse Coleman.  Bob Millender in his sage fashion said, "Well, what if we don't get the endorsement?"  And Coleman said, "What do you mean we don't get it?"  And he says, "Well, what if the UAW decides to endorse somebody else?"  The campaign had no money.  Well, the next day, the UAW did not endorse Coleman Young.  They endorsed Mel Ravitz who was the president of the city council [Detroit City Council] at the time.  Bob Millender loaned the election effort of Coleman Young a substantial amount of money, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty-five thousand dollars.  Georgia Brown who was there mortgaged her house and put that money into the campaign, and then Larry Doss took it upon himself to introduce Coleman to all of the CEOs in town of people like Dick Gerstenberg [Richard Gerstenberg] and Lynn Townsend and Henry Ford II out at Ford Motor Company, and Walker Cisler [Walker Lee Cisler].  In fact, Walker Cisler who was the CEO of Detroit Edison [Detroit Edison Company; DTE Electric Company, Detroit, Michigan] at the time put together a fundraising initiative of his own.  He introduced him to Max Fischer and asked for all those people to provide some assistance to his campaign, and they did.
Story_ID: 624037
Speaker 1: Make a long story short, with, with the assistance of, of Larry [Lawrence Doss] and Buddy Battles [Robert Battles III] who then through the weight of his union, local six hundred of the UAW [United Automobile Workers] behind Coleman's [Coleman Young] election campaign, Coleman defeated Mel Ravitz in the, in the August primary and then ran against John Nichols who was the Republican candidate, so to speak.  So the two of them faced off in November.  Coleman did not have all the horses he needed to run his campaign and so a young man by the name of William Beckham, Bill Beckham, Jr. [William Beckham, Jr.], his father [William Beckham, Sr.] was a UAW official who was now working for Phil--he had, he had, he had worked for Phil Hart [Philip Hart], the senator from Michigan, and that's when I, that's how I met him in Washington [D.C.] a number of years earlier.  He was back in Washington now working for Gus Hawkins, Augustus Hawkins [HistoryMaker Augustus F. "Gus" Hawkins], who ran the equal opportunity commission [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] in the Congress.  And Coleman called Gus and asked if he could borrow Bill Beckham to come help him with his campaign.  Another gentleman by the name of Malcolm Dade who had been a prominent local black gentleman involved in politics, was also living and working in Washington, D.C., on Hill [Capitol Hill].  The two of them came back and became the real central rocket engine behind Coleman's campaign because they knew politics and they knew Detroit and they managed his campaign well.  Coleman had promised Augustus Hawkins that he would give Bill Beckham back to him after the election, but Bill never went back.  Bill became deputy mayor under Coleman Young and Malcolm Dade became a special assistant to him as well.  And so, thus, the Coleman Young mayoral initiative was kicked off in January with a, with a flurry of activity, a lot of inaugural activities including one performance by Diana Ross who was a hometown favorite at the time.  Her concert followed the--Coleman's kind of acceptance address or inaugural address where he said, "And to all of you criminals in this city, I want you to hit Eight Mile Road."  And when he said hit Eight Mile Road, the media interpreted that to mean that he wanted them to go out into the suburbs.  I think that was just a statement that he made, never implying the definition they gave to his statement, but it haunted him throughout his political career.
Speaker 2: Now, just, just to kind of clarify that, in Detroit [Michigan], Eight Mile Road is the city limit, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.  It's the northern--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --boundary city limits.  Detroit is kind of like a slice of a pie that goes down to the river [Detroit River] with Gratiot [Avenue] running up the right side of the city and Michigan Avenue running up the left, and the city at the bottom, but across the top is Eight Mile Road, and when Coleman said, "Hit Eight Mile Road," that got misinterpreted or deliberately interpreted.
Speaker 2: He was saying, "Get out of town."
Speaker 1: That's exactly what he was saying.
Speaker 2: Get out of town.  Get out of Detroit.
Speaker 1: But that haunted him throughout his years in Detroit.
Speaker 2: So, they, they thought he was saying send the criminals, criminals, go out and rob the people in the--
Speaker 1: That--
Speaker 2: --suburbs, right?
Speaker 1: That's exactly what--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --they interpreted it to mean.  And they knew what they did, but that was the moniker that they hung on him and it stuck.  But, but he kicked off his campaign and he had, he had a great staff of people around him.
Story_ID: 624038
Speaker 1: One of the individuals who joined his, his, his team was a, a Detroit News [The Detroit News] writer, political writer by the name of Bob Pisor.  And, and during--
Speaker 2: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 1: P-I-S-O-R.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And, and what--and during the election that summer when MG and Casey [MG and Casey, Inc., Detroit, Michigan] which was a local political consulting firm was managing the campaign, Bob Pisor approached them one day and I was having lunch with them at what was then the press club [Detroit Press Club] in Detroit [Michigan].  And Bob Pisor said, "Why can't your cam- why can't your candidate ever keep his schedule?  He announces a schedule and he never keeps it.  He never shows up where he's supposed to be and he's never on time."  Well, this guy who was very critical of Coleman [Coleman Young] joined his staff within ninety days and became his public relations officer.  And so there was Malcolm [Malcolm Dade], Bill Beckham [William Beckham, Jr.], and Bob Pisor and then the fourth person to round out his big four was Dennis Green.  Dennis Green was a CPA [certified public accountant] to a local accounting firm.  He joined as finance director and Coleman had probably the most effective and the strongest groupings--grouping of individuals around him when he started that any mayor has had in a long time.  He kept several of the people who had been there under Ray Gribbs [Roman Gribbs].  Walt Stacher [Walter Stacher] was the chief accountant for the city, a white gentleman, he stayed until he retired throughout Coleman's years in office, many, many others.  Some of Ray Gribbs' people stayed, Denise Lewis.  Denise Lewis had headed up the community--Commission on Community Relations [Detroit Commission on Community Relations].  She was probably no more than twenty-five years of age, but he made her his acting personnel director.  Now he made her his acting personnel director because the charter, the new charter that had just been adopted said that you had to have five years of experience as--in personnel before you could be the director of personnel.  So Coleman got around that by naming her interim.  And when she eventually served for five years, he then made her the director of the personnel department.  He assumed, he made no changes in the police department, but there had been--when Nichols was the commissioner of police and he was Coleman's opponent in the election and he lost, he, when he ran for office after he was, after he won the primary, Ray Gribbs required him to resign.  And Ray Gribbs then named Phil Tannian [Philip Tannian] to be the commissioner and to replace John Nichols.  So when Coleman took over, Phil Tannian was the commissioner.
Story_ID: 624039
Speaker 1: When the new charter went into effect in July of, of, of 1974, the commissioner was changed to a chief of police.  It changed from being a commissioner, so chief of police because the new charter required there to be a five person board of police commissioners [Detroit Board of Police Commissioners], which would oversee promotions and the budget and community investigations.  All of that under this new charter changed radically, the oversight of the police department.  Coleman promised to get rid of STRESS [Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets], the organization that had empowered the Big Four to drive around town and intimidate people.
Speaker 2: What was, what does STRESS stand for?
Speaker 1: Stop Street Robberies, Stop Robbers, Enjoy Safe Streets [sic. Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets].  Stop Robbers, Enjoy Safe Streets, S-T-R-E-S--
Speaker 2: Is this like a--
Speaker 1: An acronym.
Speaker 2: --community generated organization that--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --was maybe--well, I know the Republican rhetoric in those days was, you know, Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] was against--you know, against crime.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And he talked about, he talked about that a lot as president.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And I guess it's trickled down all, you know--
Speaker 1: Well, this was a police initiative where they rode around town and intimidated people.  They had people who would pretend to be--police officers would dress up as bums, pretending to be drunk or whatever on the street, someone would approach and would attempt to rob them and they would shoot them.  So it was an entrapment mechanism and it truly inflamed the community, and Coleman promised to get rid of it once he, once he got to be chief--once he got to be mayor, and he did.  So no sooner than he became, than the, than the charter took effect, the board of police commissioners was set up, he asked me--I'm a vice president of New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan], to go over to the police department on a loan, share time basis and become his chief civilian there.  So it became our responsibility under the Coleman Young administration to help him reorganize the Detroit Police Department.  I went over, Coleman named his first five police commissioners.  Reverend George--Reverend Charles Butler who was his minister, his pastor was one of the commissioners, and he was the chair that first year.
Speaker 2: Now what church was he the pastor of?
Speaker 1: I'll have to, you know, I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I can't remember.  It will come to me.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: But it was Coleman's church, Reverend Charles Butler.
Speaker 2: It's not Plymouth [Plymouth United Church of Christ, Detroit, Michigan], was it?  Or--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: It was an east side church.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Doug Fraser [Douglas Fraser] who was president of the UAW [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America; United Automobile Workers] was asked to serve and he received a two year term.  There were terms staggered from one year to five years.  Ed Littlejohn [Edward Littlejohn], Dean Ed Littlejohn who was a professor of Wayne State University Law School [Detroit, Michigan] was a, was a third commissioner.  Alex Ritchie [Alexander Ritchie], a white east sider, community activist, but he was an attorney also was appointed.  And Susan Mills Peek who was a black female, she was only twenty-five years of age at the time, rounded out his, his five commissioners.
Story_ID: 624040
Speaker 1: Their first major undertaking was to implement Coleman's promotion policy within the department.  There were not as many black police officers as, as many felt that we ought to have and Coleman Young following Federal Judge Ralph Freeman [Ralph M. Freeman], a few years earlier under a suit by women, had the creed that the Detroit Police Department should hire one female for every male that they hire until the numbers go to be in balance.  So leveraging off of that, Coleman announced his promotion policy.  He took the lieutenants and sergeants and the police officers list, and divided them in two.  He said all promotions would be done where you would pick one black and one white from these separated lists so that instantly under his new promotion policy, blacks were promoted to sergeants and to lieutenant and to commanders, et cetera--well, there was no, no list for commanders but for lieutenants and sergeants, there was a list, and blacks and whites were promoted in equal numbers.  Well, the DPO [DPOA] or the Detroit Police Officers Association was outraged.  They joined by the lieutenants and sergeants sued in federal court and it went before the sixth circuit court [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit], and eventually after years, Coleman's direction had--was upheld.  But by then, the numbers were--had already began to equalize the number of lieutenants and sergeants who were African American.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: I spent a lot of time with the police department from 1974, July of '74 [1974] until the end of '86 [1986], the end of '76 [1976].  While I was there, I also oversaw the school busing initiative in the City of Detroit [Michigan], going to Boston [Massachusetts] and observing what had, what was happening there and coming back and implementing, what turned out to be a non-eventful situation here.  National media came to town thinking that there would be all kinds of disruptions with school busing, but none of that, none of the--we had no violence at all.
Story_ID: 624041
Speaker 1: Most of the cities that had school busing, the white community simply took their children out of the schools, the public schools--
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: --and put them in private schools, created these Christian schools and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --private schools or some--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --Catholic schools.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is that what happened here in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Well, some of that happened, but that--the busing--by the time busing was implemented in 1976, January of '76 [1976], you're correct, a lot of that had already happened.  Many police officers who--at that time, there was a residency rule.  They had to live in the city.  They had apartments in the city, but their families lived out in the suburbs some place.  They had already left the city.  There were some pockets within the city where the majority were still white, and it was into those areas that busing took place.  There was a lady by the name of Carmen [Carmen Roberts], I can't remember her last name.  She was, she was a strong opponent of busing and she led the charge during, during that period of time.  But we never had any, any incidents.  But, but, but shortly after that, the Detroit school system was essentially all black or became major- majority black.
Story_ID: 624042
Speaker 1: In sev- '72 [1972]--I mean in '74 [1974], then, what were the--where did black people live and where did white peo- people live in the city?
Speaker 2: Well, when I arrived in 1966, northwest Detroit [Michigan] was still a majority white.  But after the civil disturbance in '67, it began to transition as whites and most of the Jews left the city to move to Southfield [Michigan] and to Farmington Hills [Michigan] and to Oak Park [Michigan], nearing suburbs.  They were replaced by blacks who moved out of the east side, the lower east side and Russell Woods, which was an area around the Davison Freeway, which is midtown Detroit into northwest Detroit.  The--that became the pattern.  It--what created, what was also created that time was the largest housing scandal in the United States, and not unlike the scandal that we've observed in the recent past.  Blacks without the eligibility of enough income to support houses were given FHA [Federal Housing Administration] loans, welfare mothers and others and they subsequently defaulted and the houses were abandoned.  Some of the houses were not in good repair when they were sold to them in the first place.  But that became the biggest abandonment.  Detroit then had the largest abandonment, housing abandonment problem in the United States.  That began in the early '70s [1970s], right at the time that Coleman Young was taking over.
Speaker 1: So, what appeared to be progress to a lot of people moving into these was really not because there wasn't enough subsequent--
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.  And that pattern has just kind of continued over a long attenuating downward cycle in the city so that what you see now is what we have now.
Speaker 1: And that is--
Speaker 2: A lot of abandonment, some crime ridden areas.  There are still some protected areas in the city, Palmer Woods [Detroit, Michigan]; Sherwood Forest [Detroit, Michigan]; Golf Club [Detroit Golf Club, Detroit, Michigan]; and some of Russell Woods and some of the west side around the Southfield Freeway and Grand River [Avenue] are still some very decent housing.  And then downtown has begun to emerge.  There have been a lot of new construction downtown in the past decade.  And Jefferson Avenue going out toward Grosse Pointe [Michigan] is an area that has not totally deteriorated.  In fact, it has kind of become more stable than it was.  So there are some, there are some positive trends.  The area around Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan], new housing has been introduced there, new dormitories have been built.  Probably ten to fifteen thousand additional residents reside in that area on a twenty-four hour basis, bringing some stabilization to, to that part of the city.  So all is not lost.
Story_ID: 624043
Speaker 1: We were just talking about some of the problems in the city and, and you, you were talking about some of the areas that had some hope and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  And my son lives in the city and many of his friends, people who are thirty-five to fifty years of age would be his peer group, so to speak.  He's in his mid-'40s [1940s].  And they get together.  They leverage off of each other and carpool together, babysit, send their kids to nursery together and that kind of thing, but their kids go to private school.  They don't go to public school.  There are a lot of charter schools in the city.  That's an emerging industry, so to speak, and it is an alternative to public schools.  But I've always been a proponent of public schools myself.  Through my years at New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan] when I was president, we strongly supported the Detroit Public Schools [Detroit Public Schools Community District], believing that was, that was our best hope for vast education of poor black students.  But with charter schools, that is a good viable alternative, and I've changed some of my thinking.  Most recently, Robert Bobb has come to town and he's done some real necessary and needed things to better stabilize our system, and hopefully something will emerge out of it where, where there will be more confidence and the school system will deliver better products, better choices for, for the kids, and hopefully that will then encourage people to come back.  I think the land use problems in our community--I was talking to someone recently that some cities like Portland, Oregon, refuse to allow land to be rezoned around Portland.  If it was farmland in 1950, it's farmland now.  If you want to build a house out there, then you had to buy a forty acre house--forty acre farm and then build your house on it, but you couldn't subdivide it.  Well, what that forced the area to do was to reclaim the land that was in the city, and it has helped the city prosper.  Had we followed some smart land use and visionary initiatives in southeast Michigan, I think the same thing could've happened.  But there was so much land laying (unclear) and it was so cheap and the developers and others who were--who saw dollars signs took advantage of it and emptied out the city and rebuilt all of these suburbs that, that we now--that, that now surround the city because the land was cheap and available.
Story_ID: 624044
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in the city now--and I--this is starting in, in, in 1974 is the election of--Coleman Young was presiding over a--what had already started to become a downward kind of spiral.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--and a lot of people--he--when you're here in Michigan, you hear the--a lot of the more conservative politicians criticize the legacy of Coleman Young.  He--they say that he didn't like white people and was too belligerent or tried to be too black or--I mean, what was your impression of Coleman Young?
Speaker 2: Well, white people didn't like him.  White people didn't like any black politicians as far as I'm concerned during, during that era.  It was, it was very difficult to get respect if you were a black individual.  And one of the things that New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan] did was create a lot of dialogue between the races that began to break down some of the adversarial feelings and harsh perspectives that people harbored and perhaps still do because--but they affected the way people even listened to what Coleman had to say.  Coleman was a very smart person.  He wasn't educated.  He was not college trained and he resented people who were college trained, but he was smart enough to adopt all of, all of the good traits.  He knew how to communicate.  He used all of the right words to say all the right things, but he did have spicy language.  He was--he used a lot of harsh language when he spoke and, but he was never misunderstood.  And he--in one on one situations even with white people, they got to like, to like him and respect him.  People like Henry Ford II, he and Coleman became close and Coleman began to call him the Deuce.  Max Fisher was a prominent Jewish philanthropist here, he and Coleman were close.  And over time, his first, I'd say his first ten years or so, he was highly regarded and respected, but yet the under- underlying racial attitudes in the community still tended not to want to support many of his initiatives.
Story_ID: 624045
Speaker 1: For example, he built Joe Louis Arena [Detroit, Michigan] at a point in time when the newspapers all were saying that Detroit [Michigan] shouldn't build a- an arena because there was no place downtown to park.  That was their large argument, that if you're gonna build a hockey arena, you ought to build it out some place where people can drive up and park.  Because the Silverdome was built out in Pontiac [Michigan].  There had been an initiative to build a downtown stadium under Ray Gribbs [Roman Gribbs], and a group formed and sued the city, saying that you cannot use public funds to build a private stadium and prevail.  When that happened, not only did the Detroit Lions, but the Detroit Tigers were supposed to leave downtown and move to Pontiac.  But John, the owner of the, of the, of the baseball, Tigers, John Fetzer or--I can't remember his name, he got chicken and he didn't leave, but William Clay Ford [William Clay Ford, Sr.] did take the Lions to Pontiac.  But Coleman prevailed by keeping the Red Wings [Detroit Red Wings] because he built Joe Louis Arena downtown over the opp- opposition of the local media and a lot of business and industrial leaders.  The Red Wings still play in the City of Detroit.  They now need a new arena, but it was Coleman who kept them there.  He convinced Cole- he convinced General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] to build a plant in Poletown [Poletown East, Detroit, Michigan], what's called Poletown.  It's a Polish community on the east side of Detroit.  They tore down a Catholic school, they tore down a Catholic hospital to make way for Poletown, and Coleman is responsible for the General Motors Poletown plant [Detroit Hamtramck Assembly] being in the City of Detroit on West Jefferson [Avenue].  Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC] rebuilt its Jefferson Avenue assembly plant with the urging of Coleman.  But in the process, everything that Coleman did, people ripped the city off.  I mean, there was, there was a group that bought some abandoned plants and got them appraised at $40 million.  They probably bought them for a million dollars or so, but the city had to pay them to $40 million to get the land on which they could do these expansions.  So everything that happened was done with a purpose.  If people didn't get paid, they didn't help Coleman do it, and that was just the way it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it seems, it seems to be like a ongoing struggle between the collar suburbs and the city, you know, as any, any visitor to Detroit City, like that struggle--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --going on even today.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 624046
Speaker 1: Now a--now as a, as a chairman of the--it was like the police board of review or the police (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The board of police commissioners [Detroit Board of Police Commissioners].
Speaker 1: Okay, board of police--
Speaker 2: I was appointed as his chief civilian for two years and at the end of that tenure as people rolled off of the police commission, I was asked to join the board of police commissioners.  I became a member of the board of police commissioners probably in 1976.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And then I served for five years and everyone chaired the board in (unclear) at the time of their--as their tenure would, would require.  So, I, I became chairman of the board of police commissioners for the--for the one year during the five years that I served.
Speaker 1: Okay, now can--almost at the same time, in '78 [1978], you were named the president of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Larry Doss [Lawrence Doss] left.  Larry Doss left at the end of 1977 to join the accounting firm, Coopers and Lybrand.  It's now PricewaterhouseCoopers and I was named the third president of New Detroit.  I served from 1978 to 1985 when I chose to leave and join the automobile industry.  But things had begun to change because of the dialogue and the close proximity to whites were forced into dialogue with blacks over the period from the rebellion until the late '70s [1970s].  There was at least the ability to dialogue.  And the judgments of many blacks was being trusted I think a lot more by whites.  We had a prominent board that was totally representative of the black community, people like Dr. Arthur Johnson, Reginal- Reginald Wilson, Dr. (Unclear) Harrison [ph.].  And we had grassroots people who, who served as well.  And so some of it was not always pretty and pleasant to hear.  The white community who sat there as well, the business community and the, and organized labor began to understand that the plight and the dialogue and the needs of the black community and responded in some fashion.  Affirmative action was always a big deal, trying to break down barriers and get more opportunities or create more opportunities for African Americans.  The term black began to be replaced by the term African American by the end of the decade of the '70s [1970s].  One of our initiatives was to encourage hospitals to place blacks on their boards and we had an initiative.  We got, we gathered resumes and by the, by the time that initiative had been underway about eighteen months, every major hospital in metropolitan Detroit [Michigan] had one or more African Americans on this board.  My wife [Retha Hughes Douglas] became one of the board members of one of the hospitals.  I became a board member at the Health Alliance Plan [Health Alliance Plan of Michigan, Inc., Detroit, Michigan], which was a large HMO [health maintenance organization] and eventually I joined the Henry Ford Health System [Detroit, Michigan] board where I served for nearly thirty years.  So things were changing.  Af- large corporations, General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] got its first black board member, Reverend Leon Sullivan, who owned, who ran an organization [Opportunities Industrialization Centers] out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], to train workers, and he created the Sullivan principles in South Africa.  South Africa as you remember was a, was a major initiative at that time, and Larry Doss before leaving New Detroit went to South Africa with the chairman of New Detroit, Fred Matthaei [Frederick C. Matthaei, Jr.].  The two of them were invited by the South African foundation to go down and assist them in setting up an organization very similar to New Detroit there.  So there was a national perspective to some of the things that we were doing at New Detroit and there were local perspectives to the things that we were--we were doing at New Detroit.
Story_ID: 624047
Speaker 1: Well in '85 [1985]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is when you went into the minority dealer training program--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with Ford [Henry Ford II].  Did--what, you know, entered into the decision of going to business at this point 'cause you had--
Speaker 2: Well, I--you know, starting in the, in the late '70s [1970s], I and a friend of mine, a fellow employee at New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan], had started a school bus company and under contract, we were transporting youngsters, special education youngsters in the city, and some of it as a result of the, of the busing that took place.  So, I--I've--I had always been intrigued by business and I knew that by eighty--'85 [1985], I had been a New Detroit for thirteen years.  It was probably--if I was ever going to do anything in my life, I was fifty-two years of age, it was time that I consider my next move.  Otherwise I would be too old to try and do something different.  So I thought about joining one of the major corporations in metropolitan Detroit [Michigan], but none of them was really interested in a guy like me.  I mean, there was a strong belief that if you were a non-profit guy, you didn't have any real crossover skills.  You couldn't go to work for Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan] and understand how they built cars and add any, any quality thought to what it was that they were doing, especially if you were black.  So there was not a lot of interest in someone hiring me.  Plus I was pretty outspoken in some fashion and I was never one to just sit back and not express my thoughts.  So the opportunities for me to do something following New Detroit were not so great.  And looking at the options, I said, "Well, you know, anything I do is going to be a risky venture and I think the best thing for me to do is try and go in business for myself.  And what kind of business?  A business where I don't have to worry about the quality of the product I'm selling, all I have to do is sell myself."  And I said, "I think the auto industry might work for me."  I talked to the people at GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan], Roger Smith, and his people.  They made me take a test to see if I had an aptitude of--for the auto industry.  I knew I aced the test, but then they said, "Well, you passed the test, but we'll see.  We have--we'll give you a stipend of thirty-six hundred dollars a month if you go into our minority dealer program."  Well, you know, I was a six figure guy at New Detroit at that time and I had kids in college and I said, "I couldn't live on thirty-six hundred dollars a month."  So I went out and talked to Ford.  The Ford people were a lot more receptive and they understood my situation and said, "Well, you know, we can, we can probably work out a consultant arrangement with you in addition to the stipend that we give to everybody in this program and help you build--make this transition from New Detroit into this program," and they did.  And so I joined the Ford Minority Dealer Program [Ford Minority Dealer Training Program] in January of 1986, a very interesting program.  There were about thirteen other individuals in my class from all over the United States, some names that you might recognize.  Willie Naulls was one of them, a former--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --professional football player--I mean--
Speaker 1: Basketball.
Speaker 2: --professional basketball player.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was the Syracuse Nats [sic.] and the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Knicks [New York Knicks].
Speaker 2: That's right.  He was in my class.  And some other people, a guy by the name of Curtis Bunche who was a defensive end for the Philadelphia Eagles.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Some of the people in the class became successful dealers, some did not.  Some quit the program.
Story_ID: 624048
Speaker 1: Now, was Mel Farr [HistoryMaker Mel Farr, Sr.] involved in--
Speaker 2: Mel Farr was already a dealer in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in metropolitan Detroit [Michigan].  And what I found is he and Nate Conyers [HistoryMaker Nathan Conyers] and Leonard, Lenny Woods [Timothy Woods], LaRoy Doss, and some other--Bill Shack [William E. Shack, Jr.], they were already dealers, established dealers, Shack out in California, Doss in California, Lenny Woods in California, Nathan Conyers and Mel Farr here in Detroit.  They had survived the 18--I mean, the 1980s which was kind of a meltdown for the auto industry where Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC, Auburn Hills, Michigan] went bankrupt as you may remember and had to--not bankrupt, but had to get a loan--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --guarantee from--
Speaker 1: And Lee Iacocca--
Speaker 2: --the federal government.
Speaker 1: --had to come in as--
Speaker 2: Lee Iacocca came in.  So I came in just following that period and I began to understand the Ford dealers had a, had their own association.  It was first called the Black Ford Lincoln Mercury Dealers Association [Black Ford Lincoln Mercury Dealer Council], and then they changed the name to the Ford Lincoln Mercury minority dealers association [Ford Lincoln Mercury Dealers Association; Ford Motor Minority Dealers Association].  But they were the mechanism through which negotiations took place with the Ford Motor Company.  And through some of their strong and poignant initiatives, Phil Benton [Philip Benton] who was the president of Ford division, wrote what was called a blue letter.  They wanted to--the Black Ford Lincoln Mercury Dealers Association wanted Ford to guarantee that 10 percent of the dealers in America would be black, feeling that was the pro rata share of the population of blacks in America, and so they set a goal to try and establish 310, I believe is the number, of African American dealers.  And over the next several years, we all diligently worked to try and, and increase the number of dealers.  They would have an annual class.  My class was then followed the next year by another class of applicants and the subsequent year the same.  In 1986 when I joined the program in January, I was paired up with Ed Brown who was the CEO of Bill Brown Ford in Livonia [Michigan], and it was at his store that I would train and I would learn in a hands on fashion what it's like to be a dealer and, and you--while he has a large dealership much the same as this one, nobody was going to let me run their department, but I could stand next to them and watch what they did and try and get some sense and feel of what a service manager did, what a used car manager did, what a finance and insurance manager did, what a new car sales manager did, et cetera, et cetera, and that's what I did.  Ford supplemented that with in class training.  So every week or so, you would go off to some training class where they would teach you sales management, would, they would teach you fixed operations, which included how did you manage your service department or your body shop and what do you look like and how do you measure performance, et cetera.  So through a combination of hands on training at Bill Brown Ford and in class training, I began to understand what this industry was like.
Story_ID: 624049
Speaker 1: Now, I'm an accounting major and I had a master's in business administration.  I had my own school bus company at the time, so I understood a lot about this stuff.  Now I understand one thing, you gotta watch the money and, and make sure there's enough in the bank to pay your payroll and stuff like that.  I got lucky, quite frankly.  The gentleman who owned this dealership [Avis Ford Inc., Southfield, Michigan], Richard Turner, who owned 49 percent of it, the majority was owned by Warren Avis, Warren Avis whose name is linked with Avis Rent A Car [Avis Rent A Car System].  He started Avis Rent A Car out of this dealership, not at this location but, but back in the '40s [1940s] when it was located in the City of Detroit [Michigan].  Warren Avis owned 51 percent.  Turner was killed in a plane crash.  He was, he was flying his own plane up north to Boyne Highlands [Harbor Springs, Michigan] and attempted to land in a whiteout, and crashed and killed himself.  That made this dealership available.  I heard it on the radio.  I got in the program in January.  This was late March.  I immediately called the regional manager.  I guess at the time it was, it was the district manager, a guy by the name of Miller [ph.], who had, who had placed me at Bill Brown Ford [Livonia, Michigan] and said, "I'm interested in that dealership.  Is there any opportunity?"  By this time, Ed Brown and I had gotten to know each other reasonably well, liked each other well enough to say that, you know, if I had a business opportunity, I would agree that he could be my partner.  But they didn't give me any, any real consideration.  So I said, "Well, I'm not gonna take the answer of the district manager as gospel," so I wrote a letter to Don Petersen [Donald Petersen] who at the time was the CEO of Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan], and I had gotten to know Henry Ford [Henry Ford II]--Henry Ford because of my involvement at Henry Ford Hospital [Detroit, Michigan] where he was the chairman of the board.  I sent a carbon copy of the letter to Henry Ford.  I had also met Henry Ford earlier when he stepped down from the Ford Motor Company.  Coleman Young, Larry Doss [Lawrence Doss] and I along with Judge Damon Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] and Arthur Johnson (unclear), gave him a party, and I had gotten to know him.  I used to go over and brief him when I was president of New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan], so I sent him a carbon copy of the letter.  He called and told them to make it happen.  So with his top down influence, Ford then came back to me to say, "Well, okay.  We'll give you an opportunity but you gotta have a partner because you don't have enough ex- expertise to run Avis Ford [Avis Ford Inc., Southfield, Michigan]," and they were right.  Ed Brown and I formed the partnership and as I say, the rest is history.  It took us about six months to work out all the details and we came in here in November of 1986 and began to operate this dealership.  The day I showed up, several of my employees quit including the general manager and the controller and they all went to work for Mel Farr [HistoryMaker Mel Farr, Sr.].  Mel kind of raided the place, knowing that it was going to be transitioned and probably with their concern, they didn't know me, they didn't know whether I would run the place in the ground or make it successful or not, so I can understand how they might have wanted to leave.
Speaker 2: So they didn't quit because you were black coming in.  They quit--
Speaker 1: Well, they went to work for Mel.  He's black, too, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --so that couldn't have been the issue.  The issue had to be some other things, probably with some encouragement on his part.  So we walked in here and took over.  Jim Whitman [ph.], my general manager, at the current was controller over at Bill Brown Ford.  He came over to be the controller here, but he split his time between the two organizations for that first year before then joining us.  But that's how we got started.  That's how we made the transition.  I never made it all the way through the minority dealer program [Ford Minority Dealer Training Program].  I got sidetracked by buying a dealership (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, it worked out better.
Speaker 1: Worked out better.  We--I had to come up with a lot of money.  The dealership was to be sold for somewhere around three and a half million dollars and I didn't have anything, like that kind of money.  I had saved some money and I could come up with a pretty substantial amount, and I was able to--my fair share, my equal share with Ed Brown because we were gonna come in as equal partners, to buy the 49 percent that Warren Avis availed to us was eight hundred thousand dollars.  I had to come up with eight hundred thousand dollars.  So I mortgaged my house and my savings and my 401k account and all of that.  And then I was able to go to Ford Credit [Fort Motor Credit Company, LLC] to borrow the balance.  So the day we closed, I had put up all my money, but yet I had a substantial debt to pay back to Ford Credit, which means that the thing had to work.  If it didn't work, I was gonna be broke.  Well, we made it work.  We had difficulties with cash flow problems and my partner, Ed Brown, was gracious enough because he had deep pockets, when we ran short, he would put the cash in.  Otherwise we would've been broke.  For--but we paid him back with interest much the same as we would've done with a bank.  And we got healthier and healthier.
Story_ID: 624050
Speaker 1: By nineteen eighty--'92 [1992] after five years, Avis [Warren Avis] had agreed to sell us the second half at the same price as the first half, and so then we had to figure out financing for that, which we did, and we bought him out and he walked away in 1992 saying that he never should've sold us the dealership because it was successful and he should've kept it.  Well, he was, he died two years ago, a little over two years ago in his nineties, but his daughter I guess had come back and she would've been available to run the dealership, and he had a son as well who was a lawyer, either one of them could've run it, but I guess he never had a strong rapport with his children at that time until it was maybe too late.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is the Avis who founded Avis car rental [Avis Rent A Car System]--
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.
Speaker 2: --and he had been around--he founded Avis car rental in 1946, so he was around here prior to--well, a long, long time.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  But he never, he was never a hands on manager.  He always seeded 49 percent to an operating manager and all he wanted was money.  He was not, he was an entrepreneur.  He--he's one of these true entrepreneurs that come along and they don't have any interest in managing anything.  They just want to create and hire somebody to manage, and that was, that was the way Avis operated.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We did not get along very well, but I forced him to respect me.  I remember the first day we met.  We go out to his--he--his office at Avis Farms which is in Ann Arbor [Michigan], suburban location in Ann Arbor, a farm, literally a farm, and he, and his offices were in a barn.  And so I walk in and so he says, "So, you know Henry Ford [Henry Ford II]?"  I mean, he had been told that--who I was and I said, "Well, yes, sir, I know Henry Ford."  He says, "Well, I do, too."  And I knew from the way he said that, we're not gonna get along very well, and we didn't.  But we got along well enough that he grudgingly began, began to respect me.  I respected him but I didn't regard him very highly.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Well, why?  I guess, the question is written all--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, he was a typical arrogant business guy and all he wanted was money, and he didn't care how it affected us.  We ran out of cash, but yet he still wanted his distribution monthly.  So I went, I had to go to Ford Motor Credit [Ford Motor Credit Company, LLC] and say, "Listen, I want to go interest only on my loan because we can't afford to pay the principal," and then I went out to him and I sat in front of him just like I am with you and I said, "Warren, you're not gonna get distributions as you've been getting.  You're gonna get your money when we can afford to give it to you because we're not gonna put the business in bankruptcy just to satisfy a cash flow problem that you want."  And he looked at me, but what else is he going to do?  I mean, otherwise it was bankrupt.  I don't think he wanted to back, but I guess had he insisted--I mean, he did a lot of crazy things.  Once close to the time when we were supposed to sign off to buy the second half of the dealership, they had the majority of ownership, 51 percent versus 49 percent.  They held a board meeting, they invited me to come sit in the board meeting, and they voted to change the name of the dealership from Avis Ford [Avis Ford Inc., Southfield, Michigan] to Southfield Motors and they did it, and they filed it with the State of Michigan.  We only found out that they had--I didn't think they were really gonna follow through with this, but they did.  At the final closing, we found that the name had been changed from Avis Ford to Southfield Motors.  Now they did it without the approval of the Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan], which they couldn't do.  I mean, you can't change the name of a dealership under a franchise agreement without agreeing, getting the agreement of the, of the mothership, so to speak, but they did it because they just were being arrogant and disrespectful of, of us as what we were trying to do.
Story_ID: 624051
Speaker 1: This was more than a notion, you know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was, it was--there were a lot of sleepless nights and, but that's, that's true in business.  I mean, no business runs smoothly all the time, so you have hiccups and you have challenges and, and you have--I found that I did some of my best thinking while I was laying awake when I couldn't sleep at nights and so I would develop these strategies.  And the day before we were to close [on Avis Ford Inc., Southfield, Michigan], they had thrown in a lot of stuff in the closing documents including charging us more in one area that we needed to pay.  So I decided that night that--I said, "Tomorrow when I go out to Ann Arbor [Michigan] to negotiate this closing," they had a big prominent lawyer from a downtown law firm representing--and smart lawyer and they did exactly what they told him to do.  I said, "I'm gonna go in there ready to--for bear."  And my partner, Ed Brown, and Jim Whitman [ph.], my general manager and I, we met at a Big Boy restaurant on our way down to--made it six o'clock in the morning, and when I walked into breakfast, they could tell I was pumped.  I was ready to go.  And when we got to Ann Arbor and they started this, I said, "I'm not gonna have any of that shit," and I stood up right in front of them and started pointing my finger.  Sid Magnece [ph.] who was Warren's [Warren Avis] guy there, he says, "You sit down or else I'll knock you on your ass," or something like that he said.  And I told him to get up.  I said, "Come on, get up, let's go" (laughter).  I mean, I was, I was ready to go.  But anyway, we prevailed in terms of, of our insight.  And then I figured out that we couldn't trust them with our money.  So they said, "Well, when we close and we disperse all this money, how are we gonna--," I said, "I got a way we're gonna do it."  I said, "We're gonna write cashier's checks and they're gonna be made out to both of us.  I'm gonna have to sign yours and you're gonna have to sign mine," and that's what we did.  So the day we walked away, they looked at me at first and they just kind of--but, but, but when they walked away, they had their money, we had our money and we never had to talk to them again about, about that, so that was just the way it happened.
Story_ID: 624052
Speaker 1: Was it a tough transition to, to go from--I mean, I take it when you were dealing with the dealership [Avis Ford Inc., Southfield, Michigan] you had to, you weren't as involved in the not-for-profit--I mean, of course you didn't have a job in the not-for-profit sector, but you did a lot of volunteering and a lot of things.
Speaker 2: Well, I managed New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan], the organization.  I ran it, I hired the staff, fired the staff, oversaw the finances, helped raise funds.  I was the CEO basically, so, but the product that we manufactured was initiatives, programs that we mounted in the community, so I did a lot of that.  But then at the same time, I was running a school bus company where I had to make a payroll every Friday and borrow money to buy buses and maintain a--you know, a staff to do that.  So I had some smithering--smatherings of what it was like to run a business.  So when I got here, it changed.  I had to be more concerned about how we treated our customers and how we ordered our cars and whether we were ordering the right cars.  And we made some mistakes, made some big mistakes in those early days, but--
Speaker 1: For instance in terms of the car, I know in the '90s [1990s], we had the emergence of the--I guess it started in the '80s [1980s], the big SUV [sport utility vehicle]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --all of a sudden and people were buying the big cars and, you know, without--with no regard to the gas mileage and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right.  But we--the Taurus [Ford Taurus] was a prominent car.  It had just come out in 1986 and this was the end of '86 [1986].  At that time, they--the Taurus had a windshield, was a Instaclear windshield, that you could turn it on and it would defrost.  You just press this button and it would defrost the windshield.  The problem was it cost a thousand dollars and if a chip hit it would just shatter.  So we bought--Ford came to us and they had all these cars they wanted to unload and we wanted to be a big dealer and we were buying cars and positioning ourselves to do well, and they unloaded something like a hundred of these Tauruses with these Instaclear windshields in them--that's what I was talking about making a mistake.  Well, in this business if, if you want a green Taurus and I've got a red one, but the dealership down the street has the green one, we do what's called a dealer trade.  I can take my car, my red one and trade it to you and I get the green one and I deliver it to the customer.  But no one wanted to dealer trade for these Tauruses that had these Instaclear windshields because they knew they were a thousand dollars more--they made the car a thousand dollars more expensive than a regular car with a regular windshield.
Speaker 1: And if the windshield shattered, they--you would have to replace it, right?
Speaker 2: For a thousand dollars, the customer would have--and so it was quickly--then I got a hold of my Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan].  You begin to learn that even the mothership, the company itself will screw you over.  All they want to do is sell cars and once they sell them to you, they're your problem.  You have to figure out how to--your--they're on your floor plan, your bank line from either Ford Credit [Ford Motor Credit Company, LLC] or a bank that you use, you've gotta figure out how to get rid of them, and until you can sell them--some of these cars have birthdays from time to time, you know, so, but, but that was the learning process.  There's nothing better than a learning laboratory when, when it's real.  You don't learn any of that in school.
Story_ID: 624053
Speaker 1: I know that Mel Farr [HistoryMaker Mel Farr, Sr.] tried a number of interesting maneuvers to sell cars.
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: One was to place a device in a car that would disable the car if you didn't make your payments.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did you try any of--
Speaker 2: We--those method--now those are not bad methods of selling cars.  I mean, just think about it.  If you don't pay your light bill, what happens to your lights?  They turn them off.  As long as you can do that and in a safe fashion--I mean, the light company gets criticized for turning off people's lights or the gas company turning off their heat when it's zero outside and people die as a result of it.  These devices don't stop while the car is in operation.  Once you take it some place and park it and stop it, you can't restart it.  Now in a town that has a bad bus system like ours, people understand that and they need cars and we know that they need cars.  So the quid pro quo is for us to figure out a me- a way that a person who has poor credit or bad credit can own a car and we can get paid or the company that advances the funds can be paid.  That's a quid pro quo.  We have a lot of single parents, single women who have children.  They have to get them to school or the--whatever they have to do.  People need cars.  And so the challenge is to work out a mechanism that works.  Now, Mel--that wasn't Mel's biggest--he got a big, a lot of publicity about that, but his biggest problem was he violated the 80/20 rule.  The 80/20 rule in business says that you spend 80 percent of your time dealing with 80 percent of the most important things that make your business profitable and forget about the 20 percent.  In this instance, I would call the 20 percent subprime lending, that is loaning or creating opportunities to sell to people who have bad credit or no credit.  Mel reversed that.  He spent 80 percent of his time trying to expand the subprime business, feeling that the rest of it would work all by itself and he got totally out of whack and that eventually caused his bankruptcy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my judgment of what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause he had the largest collection of dealerships in the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --country for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But they were all dealer development.  There were, there were stores that were partly owned by him and mostly owned--the majority of the ownership was with Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when those dealerships didn't do well, Ford either closed them down or took them away from Mel.

Speaker 1: How did the recent crisis affect your dealership [Avis Ford Inc., Southfield, Michigan]?  I know a lot of dealers closed down as a result of the financial situation in the country.
Speaker 2: We were, we were challenged.  We--starting in about 2005, we began to see things going south.  Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan] had limited new products or products that were exciting products that people wanted to buy.  Trucks were still--but, we don't sell a lot of trucks, so we knew that we had to do something.  In the, in the meantime, they economy was melting down.  We began to furlough people.  We began to downsize to the extent we could.  We put people on four day work weeks.  We did what we could and we just hunkered down.  But I had a lot of sleepless nights, kind of seeing my life pass before my eyes saying, "Is this thing gonna work?  Is Ford gonna have to file bankruptcy and what's gonna happen?"  And our savior arrived.  Alan Mulally was hired by Bill Ford, Jr. [William Clay Ford, Jr.], and he came in in 2006 and began to do the right things.  He began to put the right focuses on product development, the right focuses on fiscal management.  He borrowed a lot of money up front from Wall Street at low interest rates, and with that money has been able to tide us over and develop the kind of products that we have now.  But for the years 2006, '07 [2007], and '08 [2008], we barely broke even.  We didn't lose any money, but we didn't make any money, which means that however we lived, we had to live out of what resources we had, we had developed prior to that period of time.  And it's only now that things have begun to emerge a little bit.  The whole, the entire domestic auto industry kind of melted down in favor of Honda [Honda Motor Company] and Toyota [Toyota Motor Corporation] and some of the other foreign import manufacturers.  And it's interesting how this business is because Toyota had projected themselves to be the largest dealer in the world and I guess maybe for a few months was that until they developed problems of their own with their recent recalls.  And so they're beginning to understand.  And that's the thing I guess that all of us learn about business.  You have to keep visual and keep your eye on the ball all the time because the minute you think it's, you got it, you don't got it (laughter), so--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You said that it was Allah Mulally?
Speaker 2: Alan Mulally.
Speaker 1: Alan Mulally.
Speaker 2: Alan, A-L-L--
Speaker 1: Mulally.
Speaker 2: A-L-A-N, M-U-L-L- M-U-L-A-L-L-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: M-U-L-A-L-L-Y.
Speaker 1: And you credit--
Speaker 2: Alan Mul--
Speaker 1: --him with the--with basically the--
Speaker 2: He came from Boeing [The Boeing Company].
Speaker 1: Alan--
Speaker 2: He joined Ford Motor Company in September of 2006 from the Boeing manufacturing company where he had been a prominent high level executive and had been touted by some become, to become their CEO, but he was passed over.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it was the best thing that could've ever happened for us.  He has come to Ford and really turned around the corporation and its fortunes and changed the culture, which was probably the most important thing that he has done.  He's changed the culture of what was the old Ford Motor Company, which didn't talk to itself, had fiefdoms within itself, the typical things that happen, especially among a group of individuals, white males who have run all the corporations in America and the world for the, for the last centuries or so, and they've done it in a fashion that they have determined best suits their needs.  And with greed abounding, they've always taken advantage of the largesse of these corporations and the projections always, sooner or later they get in trouble and that's what--they drove this industry into trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: People want to blame the UAW [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America; United Automobile Workers].  The UAW got its fair share of the pie, but the people who sat across the bargaining table also knew that whatever benefit the UAW got, they would get the same time, so it was kind of--both feeling that this industry is ours, we can grow it the way we want to grow it, and we can share the pot the way we want to share it.  And it was only with the imports coming in to challenge that proposition that they had established for themselves that had began to go away.  I mean, the cost of the cars was higher, the quality was lower, and the imports forced the domestics to do a better job of building cars and keeping their costs in line and that's what we've just experienced.
Story_ID: 624055
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned the fiefdoms within Ford [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan] and ironically, Ford is considered--I think most people would generally think, when they think of Ford, they think of Henry Ford, they think of like--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a family ownership--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --whereas when you think of General Motors [General Motors Company], you think of a lot of little divisions, you know, making up one thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you think that maybe the divisiveness was more prevalent in say General Motors than say in--within Ford with the--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, they had different models.  The Henry Ford model--and I read the life of old man, the grandfather, Henry Ford.  He got the company going and it was doing well and he was the largest auto manufacturer in the world.  He had lots of money.  They didn't even, even account for it well, but they had so much that he allowed person A to develop a engine while at the same time, person B was developing his version of a, of the same engine, and they were basically competing, and he would let them fight it out.  And it would only be at the end that they would decide they would take either person A's engine or person B's engine.  Well, what that did over the years in that company was to create fiefdoms where like Ford of Europe didn't even talk to Ford of North America or Ford of North America didn't talk to Ford of Asia.  They would develop products, they didn't share designs, they didn't share engines and all that kind of stuff because they didn't have to and they felt that if they did it, they were giving credit to the other guys, so they just were--fiefdoms within the company.  Mulally [Alan Mulally] got rid of that.  GM's model was the Alfred Sloan model, which was slightly different, but it was kind of a consensus model.  Everything was--every decision was made by a committee and they had all these committees.  When I arrived at New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan], Dick Gerstenberg [Richard Gerstenberg] was the chairman, but James Roche, his predecessor was still on the board at General Motors.  When Dick Gerstenberg stepped down and Tom Murphy [Thomas Murphy] took over, Dick Bers- Gerstenberg stayed on the board.  So you can imagine having two former CEOs, Jim Roche and Dick Gerstenberg, Tom Murphy sitting there, and they're sitting on the board approving or disapproving of any initiative you had to make.  So this consensus management mechanism that Alfred P. Sloan had exposed and was touted forever as being the great guru of how to run a multinational company, it began to fall apart.  When you couldn't make decisions or nobody was willing to step out and take responsibility for giving a new direction to something.  Roger Smith had tried it after--he came after Tom Murphy when he established Saturn [Saturn Corporation] because he saw that it was too difficult to change the morass of structure that was running GM, Chevrolet, GM--the Buick division and Cadillac division, you can't change those, so let's set up Saturn, which is separate and different, and we can do all these new and innovative implementations that we want to do in this new entity, not trying to ever change the way you always did things over here.  What happened?  It all failed.  Saturn got--had to be shut down and it was only after it go through bankruptcy that they began to change some of the inculcated practices that had high bounded the company for all those years.  I recently ran into Ed Whitacre [Edward Whitacre, Jr.], the new CEO of General Motors downtown at a meeting, introduced myself, and he said, "Yeah, you Ford guys are kicking our ass."  I said, "But you all are developing some better products."  GM has a black design--their chief designer is a black gentleman by the name of Ed Welburn [Edward T. Welburn], and they're doing, they're big--creating some exciting new products.  But the culture of the corporate--I said, "But the challenge you've got is to change the culture of General Motors," and he nodded.  He says, "Yeah, and that's a handful."  So he knows it even now after bankruptcy and all the rest of it.  It's difficult to change organizations as big as General Motors.

Speaker 1: Now just in the times we live in today, like, what--what's your best selling product and what's your demographic in terms of customer out here?
Speaker 2: Well, our demographics are probably, I'm gonna say 40 to 45 percent African American.  Southfield [Michigan] is a, is a perhaps equally divided city, blacks and whites.  Farmington Hills [Michigan] to our west is probably majority white, but the City of Detroit [Michigan], northwest Detroit is 80 percent, 90 percent black.  They all feed into Avis Ford [Avis Ford Inc., Southfield, Michigan].  We advertise deliberately to attract these customers.  We treat them all with the same amount of respect.  So whether you're black or white or green, if you walk into Avis Ford, you are treated properly.  We've won any number of awards.  We've been number one in customer satisfaction.  We've been what they call chairman, we've won chairman awards where--and we used to get national (unclear) and they would invite you to a meeting in an exotic place and you would go and get your award.  They don't do that now, they just bring it to the dealership, save all the money and time.  But we have done it right.  We have an operating philosophy that requires all of our people--we respect our own employees and we expect our employees to respect everyone who walks in the front door, whether you're dressed in Levis or cutoffs or a tank top or whatever, you get the same time and attention as anyone else, and it has worked for us.  It--we have a mixed sales staff.  We have a black general sales manager, one of the few in metropolitan Detroit.  We've tried to practice what we preach and it has worked for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what's the--I know we in the black community, I mean, there's a tendency to, you know, show you've arrived by buying a big car, big SUV [sport utility vehicle], a big--you know, a big, you know, Lincoln [Lincoln Motor Company] or something big.  Has that shifted in the, in the--because of the economics?
Speaker 2: I think some of it has shifted, but still, if people had their druthers, they would still drive Lincolns or BMWs or Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz] or Lexuses.  Nearly all my friends drive those cars.  Some of them bring their kids in and buy them Mustangs [Ford Mustang] or Fusions [Ford Fusion] or Focuses [Ford Focus], but they themselves drive luxury cars, but not all of them.  There are an awful lot of people who drive Fusions.  That's our bestselling car now because it has heated seats and air conditioning and sync system and navigational system, and everything you would want in a car that you could buy in a BMW or Mercedes or a Lexus and you can get it for less than twenty--less than thirty thousand dollars.  So people are changing their perspectives.  People buy used cars.  They will buy a used Lincoln because it looks just like last year's Lincoln anyway and nobody knows the difference and they're getting it a discount to the new car price.  People are beginning to be frugal, yes they are.  But people having their druthers--people have a love affair with cars and they like luxury cars.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: But all the luxury car sales are down in the United States at this point.
Story_ID: 624057
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: You know, I often thought about whether I could've utilized my skills in a way that would've generated more revenue for me.  I could've been more wealthy and what could I have done?  I think about getting in the development business or I think about could I have run a multinational corporation if I had ever been given the opportunity?  I applied to IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] right out of--when I got out of the [U.S.] Army and they didn't seem to have much interest in me.  And then I went to work for the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] and then I got a job offer from IBM, which at the time I just threw in the trash.  And I often wondered, had I taken that job offer in 1959 or '60 [1960], whenever it was, and gone and worked for the IBM Corporation, I was very good in data processing.  I--that's how I got my first start.  Where would I have wound up?
Story_ID: 624058
Speaker 1: I met a lot, lot of people who--they're younger than I am by ten to fifteen years and those ten to fifteen years have made a difference in the way blacks have been assimilated into Corporate America.  By the time we got into the '80s [1980s], there were people who were being recognized and promoted and becoming officers within corporations.  I still may have been a little bit too old to have been able to make a significant mark, but then maybe not.  I don't know.  But other than, other than that, I don't think too much about that.  I think about what I have made of the opportunities I have had.  I would love to have sat on corporate boards, for example, because I think I could've provided a lot of insight or sound judgment, so to speak.  I have been on boards and those boards that I've sat on, I have been considered a preeminent member of the board, a substantial contributor, contributor to the strategic actions and initiatives that the corporations have followed.  So I think I could've maybe made a mark as a board member.  All this time, all the time, the only thing that things would've generated would've been a few more dollars.  Hopefully I won't outlive my money, so if that, if that happens, the only people who will be deprived of the fact that I didn't do anything would be my kids (laughter).  They won't inherit as much as maybe they would have.  So I'm very pleased with my accomplishments and with the opportunities that I've had, some I've had to fight for.  Relationships have brought about others.  The game of golf has been big in my life.  It's a social initiative or social activity that pervades Corporate America but also pervades in a number of other venues in America, and I have been delighted to have had enough talent to be a crossover player, a crossover player.  I've played with black guys in the community and I've played with prominent people at Augusta National [Augusta National Golf Club, Augusta, Georgia].  I've been on--played at a lot of venues all over the world and I've enjoyed golf.  I just wish I could play better.  That--I guess that's what Tiger [Tiger Woods] would say right now, too (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, do you have any regrets about coming to Detroit [Michigan], it being such an iconic city now for so many things?
Speaker 1: You know, I've often wondered what my life would've been like had I not come to Detroit.  Detroit is a unique city in that it affords and has afforded more opportunities to African Americans, in my judgment, to get into business than almost any other city in the United States.  We recently got an award from Black Enterprise magazine in Atlanta [Georgia], and four of the five companies recognized this year in 2010, '10s [2010s] Black Enterprise magazine are Detroit based.  Avis Ford [Avis Ford Inc., Southfield, Michigan], we received the award as distinguished deal of the year, of their dealer of the year.  Don Coleman [HistoryMaker Donald A. Coleman] who started Don Coleman advertising [Don Coleman and Associates], which is now GlobalHue [GlobalHue Advertising], H-O- H-U-E, GlobalHue, received an award as the outstanding advertising agency, and he is soon to top a billion dollars in billings as an advertising agency.  Suzanne Shank of a bond finance company [Siebert Cisneros Shank and Co., LLC] received an award as the top financial institution of the year, and she's in the top ten bond financing companies in the United States.  And Don Barden [Don H. Barden] received the distinguished legend A.G. Gaston Award [A.G. Gaston Lifetime Achievement Award].  A.G. Gaston was a prominent entrepreneur in Birmingham, Alabama.  He received that award.  So five--four of the five from Detroit.  So, do I regret coming to Detroit?  No.  Detroit is a dirty city.  It, it--there's nothing really pretty about the city.  The downtown Renaissance Center [Detroit, Michigan] is--and, and some of the downtown skyline looks great when you're watching a baseball game in, in Comerica Park [Detroit, Michigan] or if you drive up and down the river [Detroit River] or take an aerial view, there's some prominent and nice communities and, and some of the around--surrounding communities are, are absolutely as, as nice a place to live as any place in the United States.  The lifestyle is open and free.  You can move around if you got a car easily without traffic jams, so it's a great place to live.  The midwestern values rub off on your kids if you can put them in the right kinds of schools.  They do well, but they don't want to stay here once they graduate.  They want to go away to college and they don't want to come back.  So, that's a knock on the city.  Will some of this change?  I think that what cities in America will become will probably be defined by what happens here in Detroit.
Story_ID: 624059
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I start by, by hoping better results in education.  I've always felt that the engine doesn't start until you know how to read, write and communicate.  And that's one of the things that I hope that we would be able to fix our school system and imbue a culture in our young people where they want to become high achievers, not just passively go through school to meet some end, but that they become high achievers and motivated to be successful.  That's one of my aspirations.  The other is that we will continue to fight the battle to be included in what's going on in America.  And I just know that nothing is forever.  While we've now had our first black president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], things could get worse if we allow them to get worse.  That's just the nature of human beings, to be competitive and to push for their side of the equation, so to speak, and we have to remain vigilant and, and determined to make sure that our youngsters place well in the world that, that, that is to come.
Story_ID: 624060
Speaker 1: When you look back again at everything you've done to this point today, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy is one of, of giving back, one of placing family at the center of everything that I do, one that attempts to place excellence at everything I do.  I try hard to do a good job at those things that I'm involved in.  I try and set an example by my behavior that becomes one that youngsters and others want to emulate, they want to be like Walt [HistoryMaker Walter Douglas], so to speak, like they say, you wanna be like Mike [Michael Jordan], but in a good sense.  I--I'm an understated individual.  I don't like to brag or tout my successes.  I let them speak for themselves.  So, so I try and live a Christian life of example.
Story_ID: 624061
Speaker 1: Now did your parents [Inez Highland Douglas and Frederick Douglas, Sr.] get a chance to see you become successful or?
Speaker 2: My parents passed away while I was president of New Detroit [Detroit, Michigan] in the early '80s [1980s], so they, they saw some success emerging.  They were quite proud of, of me having--my father was proud when--after I got out of college [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] I began to be a college professor [at Edward Waters College, Jacksonville, Florida].  I mean, for him, that was, that was right up there because he was an educator himself.  And then when I succeeded within, within the IRS [Internal Revenue Service], they knew I was living well and more prominent than the average Joe because we were able to do things and they could just sense we--I'd buy houses and things like that.  And then when I became president of New Detroit, they knew, they didn't know what all that may have meant or what all I was involved in, but they knew it was important.  That's all they knew about my accomplishments.  My sisters [Shirley Douglas Townsend] and brothers [Frederick Douglas, Jr.], they saw more.  When my fir--when I was first in Black Enterprise as a auto dealer where the sales of this organization [Avis Ford Inc., Southfield, Michigan] was $65 million or something like that, people think you're worth $65 million when they say sales are $65 million, they--and you're not worth anything maybe by the time you net it all out, but it made them all proud.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about your own family?  Your--well, your son is currently--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my kids were asked to appear in a video.  I received an award recently from the YES Foundation and my daughter and my two sons were taped in the video, and they could've not been more laudatory about their father, and their parents.  So I am thought highly of by my own children.  Do I get in their way sometimes?  I try not to.  That's why my son [Mark Douglas] sits in this office and I sit out at a cubicle.  I want him to--and I ask him for permission to use his office.  I just don't assume that it's my office and I can take it back when I want to.  I ask him when I want to use the bathroom, you know, if he's in here.  Can I come and use your bathroom?  I'm respectful of them and I want them to learn from me that that's the way you treat people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And are you still married?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My wife [Retha Hughes Douglas] and I have been married for--it will be fifty-three years in, in October.
Story_ID: 624062
Speaker 1: Is there anything that, that you want to say before--or, or we need to cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Nothing I can think about.  I mean, there, there, there are stories that I can tell.  As you can tell, I have a pretty good recall of things that have, have happened, names and places, some of them I can't remember, but I don't think I've not covered anything important.  I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Except I had eight holes in one playing golf.
Speaker 1: Did you really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's important.  That's (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a person who advanced the cause of blacks by breaking some glass ceilings, but breaking them in a way that exuded confidence, excellence in what I did, and in a responsible way and in a way where I was willing to share and give back.
