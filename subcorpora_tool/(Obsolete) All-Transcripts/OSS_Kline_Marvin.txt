 Paustenbaugh  Kline  Today is April 18, 2009, and we are here in the OSU Athletic  Department. This is Jennifer Paustenbaugh with the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. I am  interviewing Marvin Kline, who was a member of the 1959 World Series  Champion baseball team from Oklahoma State. Thank you so much for  your willingness to participate in this interview. I know that you   re back  here today for a fifty-year reunion. Could you talk a little bit about that  reunion and whether there have been others like it and why this one is  special?  Well, there was an induction to the Hall of Fame of the team, and then  this is the fifty-year celebration of the 1959 championship, which is the  only championship that OSU has won in baseball.  Which is pretty remarkable given some of the really great teams that  we   ve had.  Yes, there have been outstanding teams and outstanding players.  Are there guys on the team that you were especially close to that you   ve  been reminiscing with today?  I   ve reminisced with some, but there   s not any real close associations.  I   ve probably kept up with Tim Green more than anyone.  I wanted to ask you some questions obviously about the    59 team and  that championship season, but before we even get to that point, can you  tell me a little bit about your early childhood years and how it is that  you came to play baseball and whether you played in high school?  I played in high school. I played at Enid High and had a good high  school career. Actually started college in 1953 and went somewhere  5  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  around six to eight weeks and was doing very well in some of the math  and science courses and poorly in the others. I was rather immature, so I  dropped out of school and joined the Air Force in December of    53, then  got out in December of    57 and enrolled in OSU in 1958.  So I   ve heard during the time period when you were in the Air Force you  played baseball at a fairly high level.  Yes. The first year I played at Keesler Air Base  in Mississippi , and that  was in 1954. And that was a time when the draft was on and they just  signed the ceasefire for Korea, and you had a lot of both major leaguers  and minor league players that were on the military teams. I played on a  team called Keesler Air Force Base  in Mississippi , and I was the only  player on the team that had never played professional baseball. I was  green, right out of high school, and it was a real experience.  I bet it was. Did you feel like that really lifted the quality of your game,  being able to play with guys like that?  Very much, very much. Mainly because the manager was recalled   his  name was Dixie Howell, and he was a Major and a pilot that  was   called back into the Korean War. He took me under his wing and taught  me it was like drinking out of a fire hose. (Laughs) I learned more  baseball in that period than I ever had in my life. The team was the  equivalent of a class A team, from what I understood. The competition  we played against was very high level. There were people like  Wilmer  David     Vinegar Bend    Mizell and some others that went on to have  good major league careers that we played against. Then after I left, I  graduated from electronics school. I spent forty weeks in electronics  school.  Was that at Keesler  Air Force Base ?  That was at Keesler. Then I went to the Far East into Japan, and I was in  radar. I was a radar technician there, but I also played baseball. I was  fortunate enough to be selected on an Army-Navy-Air Force-Marine  All-Star team that played against the New York Yankees in 1955 when  they made a goodwill tour. They would play the Japanese teams, and  then occasionally they   d play this All-Star team I was on at the military  bases because of keeping up the morale of the military. We had some  unusual fields in the Far East. We had state-of-the-art baseball fields that  would seat 10,000 people, lighted, and you   d get very, very large  crowds. So it was a real thrill to get to play against and bat off people  like  Yogi  Berra and    Whitey    Ford and Tommy Burns and that.  Talked to Yogi Berra and Billy Martin    Moose    Skowron and those  guys. It was quite a thrill.  6  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  So you finished your commitment to the Air Force in 1957 and decided  to return to school.  Right.  And so, I mean, for most guys that would mean that they had sort of  missed the window for being recruited to play baseball at the college  level.  Right, actually     And yet Toby Greene was interested in you. How did that happen?  Well actually, I had an offer for when I got out of the service for the Red  Sox, and the scout was a guy by the name of Jack Southwick. He said  the Red Sox are interested in me playing baseball, and they were willing  to offer me a Double A contract. Whether I would   ve stayed at Double  A, they would   ve sent me down to wherever, but anyway, that   s what he  said. I told him, I said,    Jack, I   m not interested. I realize that I probably  don   t have the ability to play major league baseball, and I want to go  into business, so I   m going to get my education.    So I enrolled at OSU.  So was your intent really just to be purely a student at that point?  Yes.  So how did it come about that Toby Greene contacted you?  Well, of course, freshman weren   t eligible at that time, and I enrolled   I  got out in December of    57, enrolled in    58. And at    59, I   m studying  along and happy, and one of the players on the team by the name of Bob  Adams came up to me, and I   d known Bob earlier. I lived in Enid and  Bob was basically from Garber, which is about 15 miles away. And he  says,    Marvin, Toby wants to see you,    and I said,    What for?    And he  said,    He wants you to play,    and I said,    Well tell him I   m not  interested.    So a couple days later, Adams comes by again. He says,     Marvin, you really got to go talk to Toby.    So I said,    Okay.    So I went  and talked to Toby, and as I think a lot of the guys found out later, that  Toby never shared a lot with people, but once you were kind of one of  Toby   s guys, he would give you a lot of information. And he says,    I  want you to play.    I said,    Toby, we   ve talked about this before, and I   m  not... You know, I want to get a degree, I want to go to graduate school,  I want to be in business, and you know, baseball   s not for me.    And he  said,    Well,    he says,    I have an unusual feeling,    he says.    I think this  team can go all the way.    I said,    Okay, where do I fit in?    And he said,     I want you to be my safety valve. I know you naturally play shortstop,  7  but you also can play second and third.    He says,    I   ve got a couple of  sophomores, Andrews at second and Dobson at third,    and he said,    I  think Andrews is going to work out.    But he says,    I really don   t know  what I   ve got in Jim.    And he says,    I want you to come out and play,     so I said,    Well, okay.     So I worked hard, I got in shape, running the pit, the dirt pit in the  basement of the field house with all the dust and everything. So things  were going along pretty good, and I worked out mainly at third and then  some at second. We made a trip to Houston, in the Houston area, kind of  like a spring training trip. When we were there I played one game part of  the time at second base and the other game at third base, and as it was I  was talking to Roy and he   Peterson, he doesn   t remember it all that  much, but Toby asked me to work with Roy and go over some old  exams because Roy was having some problems with chemistry. So while  everybody else was running on the beach, Roy and I were in there going  over   and I thought, what a way to spend time in Galveston. (Laughs)  Because we went from Houston to Galveston.  So we came back and practiced, and about a day after we came back,  Toby called me in. He said,    Okay, what do you think of the team?    At  that point I realized that Toby was kind of using me a little bit as the  eyes and ears of the team, because he had just this unusual feeling about  it. The team was chock-full of good players, so I told him,    Andrews is a  little cocky, but he   s good. You   re not going to have any problem there.     I said,    Dobson has got range, he   s got a good arm. I think he   s got a  good attitude. I don   t think you have any problems there.    He said,     Okay, how about the pitching?    I said,    Well,  Dick  Soergel will keep  you in every game, Peterson   s an absolute battler, and  Joel  Horlen has  really good stuff. But I   ve noticed that after about three innings or so, his  fastball flattens out.    I said,    This guy   s got really good stuff, Toby, but  I think he   s out of shape. You   ve got to get him in the outfield and run  him. Run his rear end off.    (Laughs) Toby looked at me, and he grinned.  He says,    I   ll get him there.    So we had a little more conversation, you  know. I never thought much about it, so I went on.  About a week and a half later I went into Toby, and I said,    Toby, I   m  falling behind in school work. I   ve got two hour optics labs, I   ve got  other four hour labs, and I   m not going to be able to keep up and have  any grades at all. And if I   m going to get into graduate school, these  courses are too hard for me to just sail through.    And he said,    Well,    he  says,    hang in there a little bit. I still want you to play.    So I said,     Okay.    So about a week later I went in. I said,    Toby, I   m not going to  be able to do this. I just can   t do it. It wasn   t in my plan and anything  else. I   ve got to concentrate on studies.    And he said,    Okay, well,    he  said,    I still consider you my safety valve. Will you stay in shape in case  8  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  something happens and then you   ll come back?    And I said,    Yes.    So I  worked out on the weekends  on my own  and would take some batting  practice  at one of the softball fields , some guys would throw to me,  and that   s really my role with the team. And you know, I never went to  Omaha or anything like that, but I was kind of in at the inception and  formation of the early phase of that team until Toby felt very secure with  the players. And Toby was a real superstitious person. Most people  didn   t know that, and of course anybody that was a freshman or a  sophomore was totally suspect in Toby   s eyes, and that   s why he was  real concerned about Dobson not so much as Bruce. And of course  Dobson went on to have a great year.  Wasn   t he the MVP?  Yes. (Laughter)  Interesting. Well, I mean I   ve heard that baseball has more superstition  surrounding it than most sports seem to.  Yes. I can never remember stepping on the white line as I left the field.  (Laughter)  So that was your personal superstition.  That was my personal superstition.  So it sounds like you were very busy as a student here. Were there any  places when you had some free time, if you had free time, that were  hangouts that you enjoyed being at?  Not really. I was taking somewhere in the neighborhood of eighteen  hours, and one semester I took twenty-one hours. I actually completed  my coursework before my four years were up, so my last semester was  basically graduate studies for graduate school, and I made the transition  from physics to electrical engineering. I was kind of a pilot student  because of the electrical engineering professor who  was  head of the  double E  electrical engineering  department. It was his first year, and he  wanted to put more emphasis on the physical science/physics aspect of it  than just power line transmission and things like that. And so he says,     Well, you   ll be a good candidate. I can see if this works out.    So I  ended up taking a lot of the senior level double E courses at the same  time I was taking the M.S., so I had the equivalent of a B.S. in double E  along with an M.S. in double E. Then I took a considerable amount of  math courses, so I had a healthy dose. I took a minimum of fifteen hours  even in graduate school, and sometimes eighteen. The first semester that  I started, I actually took twenty-one hours, and I   d never do that again.  9  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  (Laughter) That was just     Some mistakes you definitely don   t want to repeat.  Yes. I felt like a zombie.  It sounds like in the intervening years between when you started school  and when you came back to be a student that you had learned a lot  about self-discipline and about organizing your time.  Yes. As a matter of fact, I had a unique opportunity, and before I was  discharged, my commanding officer came in. He says,    Marvin,    he  says,    I know you want to go to college,    and he says,    I have an offer  for you and an opportunity.    And I said,    What   s that?    and he says,     How would you like to go to the Air Force Academy?    I said,    Well, I  hadn   t thought of that.    He said,    Well, the school year will start in the  fall of    58,    and he says,    If you will accept, you have an appointment to  the Air Force Academy, and you will go to a prep school in the spring  semester.    And he said,    The Air Force, you   ll be considered full duty,  but because you   re out of school and you haven   t had good study habits,  we   ll send you for a prep semester and that way when you enter in the  fall, you   ll be up with anybody else.    So I thought about that for a while,  and I decided that the military wasn   t for me and I wasn   t going to do  that, but I did have a   I   d kind of forgotten about that, I did have an  opportunity to go to the Air Force Academy and stay in the military.  Yes, that   s a really great offer to have had.  Yes. I didn   t appreciate it as much at the time. (Laughter) I looked back  on it, and I thought,    Wow, that   s pretty neat.     Yes, that   s great. So tell me about your career once you had finished  your M.S. in Electrical Engineering, which it looks like you finished in  1963?  Yes.  After that, what did you do?  Well, I spent ten years with Texas Instruments  TI  in a variety of roles.  So were you based out of Houston?  No, it   s in Dallas. We moved to the Dallas area, and in 1964 we bought  a house in Richardson, which is the first suburb north of Dallas. I had a  lot of opportunities at work there. I worked in TI   s first New Business  10  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Development group, and we put together strategy for the calculator and  for the microprocessor for the car   several things like that. There were  seven of us in that, and that was a real interesting time. I realized that I  didn   t want to make a career with Texas Instruments, although it was a  really great company with excellent people and very high ethics, which I  liked very much, but I decided that I was ultimately going to probably  start something up of my own. One of my things I didn   t have in my  background is I didn   t have direct sales experience. I had engineering, I  had systems, I had manufacturing. So I resigned and went to work for a  division of General Telephone  GT , which is now Verizon, and it was  in their computer side of the house. It was called GT Information  Systems. It was a lot of the type of products that connected to an IBM  mainframe or that, video terminals, key-to-disk systems, and of course,  being a telephone company, it had modems and multiplexors and  communications equipment. So I was a salesman in the Southwestern  region and then ended up directing some of the marketing and sales  efforts for the video terminal line.  I was there for about three years, and then I jumped out and in my  wonderful wisdom started up a company with a desk in my study and an  answering service, convinced that I would conquer the world, that it  would take me probably about six months to do that. But I had reserved  capital for a year. I thought,    Well just in case.    So after 18 months, I   d  made  1,500, and I thought,    What did I do?    (Laughs) Things slowly  started turning around. So that original venture has morphed into a  manufacturing company that manufactures a specialty line of industrial  computer terminals that are used for work-in-process shops or to control  time and attendance. We have an office in Mexico City, and so we sell  them to about 30 countries around the world, so it   s developed into kind  of a   it   s a small business. It   s a specialty niche market, but it   s been  very nice, and I   m still active in the business.  So is that Linx Data Terminals?  Linx Data Terminals.  That   s pretty impressive,  1,500 in six months you had to have a lot     Eighteen months.  Eighteen months. You had to have a lot of self-confidence, but     Well, there   s also a lot of terror that goes along with it too. (Laughs)  Because,    What did I get myself into, and can I ever manage my way  out of this mess?     11  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Right. So I mean it sounds like you   ve been in sort of at the ground floor  with the development of a number of these technologies. You seem to  really get into     I like to create and make things. I   m not somebody that   s going to put a  company to bed or do something like that. I like to build things, make  things, and be a part of watching something happen.  So is that something that you still do? You say you still have affiliation  with Linx     Yes, I   m the Chairman. I   m active, and I   m there on a daily basis.  So no retirement plans yet in sight for you?  Probably in about a year and a half I   ll figure on doing something along  that line. You know, I   m like everybody else in this marketplace; I want  to get my 201K back up to a 401K. (Laughter)  I understand completely. I noticed that one of the activities that you have  listed when you were a student here is that you were president of Delta  Tau Delta fraternity. Could you talk a little bit about your involvement  with the fraternity and if you   ve continued to be involved as an alum?  Well, it was a small group and struggling. It seems like I have an affinity  for that type of thing without realizing it, and a high school friend of  mine that joined the service with me convinced me that we ought to do  that. One of the reasons that I did was that I found I could work as a  house boy and I could get my meals for free, so that was a really good  thing. I ended up liking the fraternity, and the guys ended up electing me  president. And we built a good organization   that group from what one  time was thirteen people up to thirty-something people. We ended up  with what   s called the Hugh Shields Award, and that was the  outstanding award for all of the fraternities in the United States as far as  academic excellence. The fraternity ended up with over a 3.0 grade  average as a total.  That   s pretty impressive.  So I was proud of that. We built it into being able to pay the house  corporation for the building, and then after I left, in a few years they  built a completely new building. We had a small building, an old  building, and then we had what we called the annex, which was a shack  adjacent to it. (Laughs)  Annex sounds so much better, doesn   t it?  12  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  Kline  (Laughs) Yes, it does. I still follow and communicate with some of those  guys, and there   s an alumni group in Dallas that we have lunch every  once in a while. So it was a good association.  One question that I failed to ask you closer to the beginning of the  interview is how did you choose Oklahoma State? Was it just because it  was close, or was there some reason?  I actually thought about going to Georgia Tech, which is a good  engineering school, and I was stationed at Warner Robins, Georgia, after  I came back from  overseas . I don   t know, after four years in the service  and being away, I just kind of wanted to come back home and be with  some friends and do some things. I was tired of that. I was more  homesick than anything else. OSU had a very good physics and  engineering department, and I had an opportunity when I was out of high  school to go to OU with Jack Baer as the coach, but that didn   t appeal to  me. I really didn   t care for OU. They weren   t that good in science and  engineering. As far as I   m concerned, they   re still not. (Laughs)  That   s something we   ll keep on the interview. (Laughter) So are there  other members of your family that ended up going to school here?  My wife is a graduate, and we actually met in a chemistry class. She   s  from Enid, and she   s about three and a half years younger than me,  because by the time I got out of school and came back we were both in  the same grades. And we started dating when I was a   well, the  semester that I started baseball.  That was a busy semester   And then one thing led to another, and we got married, and we   ve been  married ever since.  Great. Well is there anything that you wish that I had asked you during  this interview that I didn   t touch on?  No, you probably got more out of me than I intended to talk about. A  couple of things I had really not thought of in a while, but it was  interesting.  You have a very interesting story.  Well, it   s kind of unusual. Both Tim Green and Jim  Dobson  said,     Hey, you need to tell the guys that. Because Toby was always reserved  and that...    And so I said,    Yes, I guess I saw a side of him that, you  know, if I had played in the normal sequence of things, probably would  13  Paustenbaugh  Kline  Paustenbaugh  never have discovered.     Right. Well good, thanks. I   m glad they talked to you and you decided to  come.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
