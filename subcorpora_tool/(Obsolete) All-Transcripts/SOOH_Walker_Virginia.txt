 Finchum  Walker  Today is March 25, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library and we are conducting an oral  history project featuring home economists in Oklahoma. Today we   re  here  at the OSU Library in Stillwater  with Virginia Walker. She  started as a home economist in 1957 and retired in 1991 as county  director for Washita County. Thank you for coming today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s start by having you talk a little bit about your childhood, and then  we   ll work our way forward.  Well, my maiden name was Hall, and I grew up in the rural community  of Hollister, which there is nothing there now but a few homes and one  church left. They even lost their post office. I spent all my growing up  years there. Came to Oklahoma A M to college, graduated from here in     57 and went to Cordell in Washita County for my first job. I met and  married a local fella and stayed there the rest of my life. (Laughs)  My parents were farmers, and I had two older brothers and an older  sister. I still have one brother living who is a bachelor brother and is in a  nursing home near where I live now that I am responsible for taking care  of. I   ll go back to the old home place about once a week, or some of the  family does, to just check on things. There   s still a house full of  furniture, and things there that we haven   t gotten rid of yet. That   s an  eighty-five mile drive. He was at home by himself for two years. He was  able to take care of himself, so that was for sure once a week for  groceries and mowing the lawn, et cetera.  My parents had an interesting background. My mother came from  Germany as a girl. She was about nine years old when they arrived at  Ellis Island, and they have a brick there now, which one of my cousins  5  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  put with their family name on it. Her name was Kuepker, K-U-E-P-K-E-R,  which is, even though we have a German settlement in the county  where I live, even on trips I   ve made, I   ve never found another name  like that. She and her family went to Chicago first because they had  cousins already there, and migrated then gradually to Oklahoma area in  the early 1900s. She died in, what, 1978, so she   s been gone a long time.  My father migrated from Pennsylvania. His step-dad was a railroad  agent and he was the depot agent, so they moved west with the railroad,  and arrived in what is called the    Big Pasture Territory    before state-hood  in 1906. So the homestead I grew up on was the original  homestead that was homesteaded by my grandparents, and my dad was  about fifteen at that point. So, interesting history, I think. I   ve always  wanted to go back to Germany and track relatives but have never had the  opportunity, but my brother was stationed in Berlin two years in the war  and he did meet some of our family there and was acquainted with them.  So was the homestead the 160 acres initially?  At that point, right. So it   s a hundred year farmstead, which there is an  organization in Oklahoma that recognizes those now, and if you fill out  an application, which I keep thinking I   m going to do and haven   t done,  they   ll put a sign in your yard and say that,    This is a hundred year  homestead.    Two rooms of the house that I grew up with are the original  two rooms when they built that homestead and then it was added on to  over the years. And it was actually torn up in the tornado once, lifted off  the foundation and sat back. My grandmother at that time, my father   s  mother, was injured severely in that storm. She was in the house when it  hit, and did not live too many years after that. He had a step-dad. His  father died when he was a baby. He was a diabetic, I understand, and his  mother remarried, the gentleman who was the railroad man.  My dad, Raymond, his original name was Garvin, and when they got to  Oklahoma, people just couldn   t understand why his name was different  from his mom and dad   s. So he acquired the name Hall, which was  never legally changed, and when he got old enough to draw Social  Security   and you have to produce a birth certificate   he was born in  Clarion, Pennsylvania, the courthouse had burned, there were no records  there anymore, he had nothing that showed what his true name was.  And, of course, all the people he knew in Oklahoma didn   t know him at  birth, so they couldn   t vouch for him. So it was about a two year process  for us to get some identification down to justify who he really was, that  he was eligible to do that.  And you yourself grew up on that farm?  6  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  I grew up on that farm, right, and it   s in my name now. Well, the other  eighty acres belongs to a niece of mine. When an older brother of mine  died, he gave her part of that.  When your parents had it, what were their products?  They raised wheat and cotton, basically, and probably some feed grains  over the years, off and on, depending on the season and the prices of  things and so forth. But they always had cattle and raised hogs. We  always butchered and had lots of chickens. They   d buy 500 baby  chickens every spring, and that was my job to feed those babies and  gather the eggs, so that was something I can remember. Separating the  milk and cream, and of course that   s how they made a lot of their  income was selling the cream and the eggs.  And did you have to pick cotton yourself?  No, when I was the age to actually pick cotton my dad didn   t raise any. I  would pick for our neighbors once in awhile, so I did very little cotton  picking. But we pulled cotton at that point, we didn   t pick it. We pulled  the whole bowl, and that was hard on your hands. But I was pretty good,  the summer or two I got to do it, and I do remember doing that.  Did they have county agents that came to visit the farm, is that how you  got interested?  I was in 4-H, grew up in 4-H, and the home demonstration agent at that  time came to our school. I was active in 4-H from fourth grade on up,  and actually was a National 4-H Winner in 1952, a health winner. I got  to go to Chicago on the train, my first ride on the train. My mother was a  home demonstration member. She belonged to an extension  homemakers group   that wasn   t called that then. I guess it was home  demonstration clubs, probably.  Do you remember the name of it?  It was United Neighbors. Most of the ladies were farm wives in the  general vicinity. I can remember my mother telling, of course I don   t  remember this, I was born 1935, that she came to the Homemakers  Conference here on the A M campus on the back of a cattle truck, and  they stayed in tents on the campus, on the grass. She was pregnant with  me and nobody knew that, even her best friend, until I was born in  November after that July or August, whatever month they came at that  time. So I   ve been involved in Extension since birth  I was born in a  clinic in Fredrick, Oklahoma, which I think my brothers and sisters were  probably born at home, but there   s a pretty big jump. I used to tease my  7  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  mom about if I was an accident or an after-thought, because I came  along kind of late in life. She   d just grin. (Laughter) She never did say  anything.  Did she have a college education?  Yes, she did.  From?  She was about nine when they came to America, and when they got to  Oklahoma, I understand that she went to high school in Fredrick, I think,  and she boarded with some of the nicer, wealthier families, and did  housework for them, and went to high school. She graduated from high  school and she went to Southwestern Teachers    College, I think it was at  that time, got her teacher   s degree and actually taught school two years.  Or maybe, I say two years, I   m not real sure about that. I know her first  year of teaching, she was teaching in a small community in Missouri.  She   d gone to Miami, Oklahoma. She was dating my dad at that time.  And I have found their letters. I haven   t got them all read, but in the  process of cleaning out this homestead house, where my brother lived, I  have found their correspondence for that year and a half that they  corresponded before they were married. It   s pretty interesting  (Laughs)  Special, too.  Yes. Anyway, at that time, teachers could not be married. Let   s see, that  was before Extension was organized. They were married in 1917, but  they met in Oklahoma City at her Christmas break. He went to the city  and she came from where she was teaching and they married and they  both went back their separate ways and she never told anybody where  she was, because she   d have lost her job. But, of course, his family  knew. They were at home and they were far enough away that the news  didn   t get back. The letters were all addressed to Miss Marie Kuepker,  even though they were legally married. And in the letters he tells a lot  about the hard times they had trying to farm with mule teams and this  was probably, what year were they married, I think 1917. It was  extremely dry both years, and I   m going to say wheat made two bushels  an acre. They were recruiting for WWI, he was scared every day that  he   d get a letter in the mail that he   d be called, and never was, but he   d  tell of all the neighbors that had to go to the service, and even mother,  when she was at school at Southwestern   well, it wasn   t Southwestern  then, but whatever they called the college at Weatherford. She had to  take training, army training, drills and all that stuff as a female. So  interesting background, and I   m learning more all the time by reading  these letters.  8  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Well, and they had to make it through the Depression times then, it  sounds like.  Yes, they did. And that   s when I was born, the Depression, so they had  three other kids by the time I came along. But they hung in there.  And you finished high school in     In Hollister, then came here while it was still at A M, it changed to  OSU the fall after I graduated.  How early on did you decide you wanted to do home extension?  I wanted to be a history teacher. We did not have home economics or  anything like that in the little rural school, and I loved history and that   s  what I wanted to do. My dad wanted me to go to a business school. We  were Methodist, and he wanted me to go to OCU in Oklahoma City, and  because my two brothers had already graduated from here, well, this was  where I thought I wanted to come. I   d come every year to 4-H Roundup,  and so forth, so when I got here and began to take the classes that were  required for freshmen, and home economics was the only thing I think I  knew. (Laughs) And that was the easiest classes I had. So that   s sort of  how I ended up in the school of Home Economics, and got my degree in  Education and my teaching certificate, but I never did actually teach in a  school system. Did my practice teaching, lived in the home management  house on Sixth Street.  Tell us a little bit about that.  Well, that was an interesting experience. (Laughs) It was fun, I enjoyed  it. I had the only room on the main floor, a single room with just a twin  bed in it. Everybody else was upstairs. I don   t know how I managed that,  but anyway, that was kind of neat in my opinion, because I   d always had  a roommate in the dorm, so it was kind of nice to have a private room.  We discovered when we went down in the basement to have some fun  sometimes that the bedroom  our house mother  occupied upstairs, the  pipes ran up and down, that she could hear everything (laughs) we said  up in her bedroom from us in the basement. So when we discovered this,  we got on a little better behavior. Not that we did anything bad, but we  just, typical girl talk. We   d have a boyfriend over once in awhile, which  we were not supposed to do. But anyway, that was fun.  Describe the house itself then, was it just a typical     Yeah, it was just a two-story, white frame home.  9  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Two bedroom? Three bedroom?  There was six girls, so there was probably three bedrooms upstairs, I  would imagine, and the house mother had one, and I guess the other five  girls shared the other two bedrooms, and     And how long did you have to do that?  We had to do that six weeks, just like we had to do practice teaching six  weeks. And we took turns, every week one of us was, I don   t remember  the title, but we were in charge. We had to be responsible and saw that  the others did their jobs, whatever their assignment was, whether it was  cooking or cleaning or laundry or whatever the responsibilities were. So  that way we went through every step of keeping a home. It was  interesting.  What were some of your favorite classes then within the coursework?  I think some of my easiest classes were the ones I had to do with  demonstrations, because I   d done that all my growing up years in 4-H,  public speaking and that kind of thing. But I really enjoyed the clothing  and probably the home interior, the furnishings, design, that kind of  thing. Cooking is not my thing; I still don   t like to cook. I   m not a good  cook, even though I had to do a lot of that as a home economist and  teaching, that was different than doing it every day at home. (Laughs)  Do you recall any of your professors that stand out?  I   m getting terrible about names. The lady that was the tailoring teacher,  her brother was  Chester Gould,  the cartoonist that drew Dick Tracy.  She stood out in my memory, and the tailoring classes. I had several of  those. I can   t remember any of their names, really.  Which dorm did you live in?  I lived in Willard. Which, I don   t know if it   s still a dorm now or     It   s administrative.  That   s kind of what I thought, they   d changed it. Lived on the third floor  in the same room for three years, same roommate, and in the fourth year,  because we were out six weeks doing practice teaching and six weeks in  the home management house, I got a single room, and my roommate got  another roommate, but we still correspond, my college roommate.  Oh, that   s very neat.  10  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  I keep up with her a little bit.  So after graduation, then what?  Then I got my first job, and I assume I had to apply for that. By then I  had decided what I wanted to do, and I can remember the day they took  me out for an interview. At that time the state was divided into districts,  and the southwest district home economist, or the district home  demonstration agent, and the district agent, I guess, who was a man,  drove me out to Cordell. We came in on Highway 152 (I-40 wasn   t there  yet) and came to the courthouse, which our courthouse is a square which  you drive around and so the highway runs right into it. We went around  the courthouse two or three times before we found a parking place. We  parked on the west side of the courthouse and by then I had no idea  which direction I was going. Walked up to the second floor on some big  steps outside, walked down the steps inside, back down to the first floor,  came in what I always called the back door to the extension office, and  to this day, I   m turned around in that courthouse. Even though we were  officed there probably twenty years of the thirty-four that I worked,  when I get inside I   m turned around. (Laughs) I always blame it on that  first experience there. We met with the current workers in the office at  that time and with the excise board, who were responsible also for  hiring, and got my first job. Started June first and I graduated about the  middle of May.  That   s pretty quick.  Stayed there my entire career, which was pretty unusual, because at that  time, if you wanted a promotion, you moved to another county. You  were not allowed to go back to the county where you grew up, and I had  indicated that I would like to be in that part of the state, because that was  home to me, and so that   s why we ended up at Cordell. They liked to  move you around, and I had several opportunities to move, but because I  married after I   d worked about two years, I guess I was old school. I just  never had the feeling that I could say,    I   m going to move to  Woodward,    or    I   m going to move to Tulsa, I hope you can find a job  when we get there.    I just wouldn   t do that, so I never would move, and  I was penalized, pay-wise. I didn   t get an increase in pay for a number of  years, and that was the dean of agriculture, extension person, that was  his philosophy. If you wouldn   t move, you wouldn   t get a raise, because  you weren   t being advanced. And at that time too, you couldn   t advance.  I was the 4-H agent, and you couldn   t become the home demonstration  agent in the same county. You had to move to another county to do that,  and that was their philosophy for a number of years.  Well if you did that, then could you come back?  11  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Probably. Yeah, I probably could   ve come back, yeah.  And you could be married then.  Yes, you could be.  Early on you couldn   t, I understand.  Right, the home economist or home demonstration agent that I had  growing up, you could not, she could not marry at that time, and she was  not married. Ms. Kitty Johnson, I remember her well.  Is she still     No, she   s been dead a long time. And Laxton Malcom was the county  agent, and he even took my mother as a chaperone with me and the  group of kids from our county to Kansas City to the American Royal.  That was a trip that you could win with your works, and we have fond  memories of Laxton. He died not very many years ago. But I think at the  time I retired I was the only agent in Oklahoma who had done their  entire career in the same county.  In one place. Interesting, I bet.  Yeah. Interesting concepts.  And I understand the same office.  Yeah, except we moved out of the courthouse. The county bought a  building and we had our own office building toward the end. We only  had two other county directors that were above me, all those years, so  kind of a record probably, too.  Well, if you were willing to move, was a promotion a thing that women  could think about, or was it more of a man   s world?  It was more of a man   s world. Yeah. Because, at that time, women were  not county directors. You could be a 4-H agent. We were a fairly large  county. We had an ag agent and a home economist and a 4-H agent, men  and women. So we had a four-county office, and eventually were made  an area office. At one time we had seven people. We had an  entomologist, we had an agronomist, and we had an economist, and we  had a livestock specialist. We had four area specialists in our office. We  were considered an area office, but now there   s two. (Laughs) Back  down to two, so times change.  12  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  I would think that you had to interact quite a bit then with your  counterpart, the county agent?  Yes, yes.  The male county agent.  Yes, but you know, when you were the 4-H person, at that time, I know  we had as many as eighteen clubs, and every school had a junior club  and senior club. The county now only has one, two, three, four schools,  and I   m not sure they even all have 4-H clubs. And of course, we went  to every meeting, every month, so we were out of the office a lot. I  presented a program, sometimes just to the girls. The man agent  presented one to the boys. Sometimes we did it together with the total  group. I prepared lots of posters. That was before all this visual aid  equipment and things. I did everything with posters, and spent a lot of  time preparing lessons. That was basically what we did, and then, of  course, getting ready for all the competitive activities that the 4-Hers  did. And then, I finally did get to be the home demonstration agent, and  at that point, shortly after that, then I had to do both programs. I had to  do the 4-H and the adult program. And then we got a 4-H agent again, so  it was back and forth like that over all the years. I finally ended up with  just the adult women   s program, and the county directorship.  Well at that time, how many adult clubs were there?  We probably had about eighteen. There   s four now, so it   s a sad  situation, it really is. I really retired at a pretty good time. It was getting  to be a lot more paperwork, a lot more government regulations and stuff,  and you were required to do so many different things that we never had  to do. They don   t, and I   m not criticizing the agents that we have now,  but even with four clubs, she may come once a year. I never missed a  club. I went every month to the homemakers clubs. Later on in the years,  because of additional responsibilities in the office, I tried to go every  other month and present a program. I mean, I did a program as well, so I  was always preparing. And I did a leaders    meeting every month. We  didn   t have state specialists sending out programs for us   well we did  toward the end of my career, but not probably until the last five or six  years.  Would you pick what programs to do, or would the clubs ask you what to  do?  The clubs did it. We had a program planning meeting in the fall of every  year before the new year began, and each club submitted ideas for  lessons. Then they came in and they decided, well I was there too. They  13  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  picked out the ones that they thought they wanted to do.  And if you weren   t well versed, you got training from somewhere else?  Asked somebody else or I dug around until I found the information, you  know, and that was before computers. I   m computer illiterate. The only  person that had a computer in our office when I retired was the  secretary, and so you didn   t have any opportunity to go look all that  information up. You think that   s not been that long ago, really thinking  of the electronic age, but the funding was part of it. You had to buy  those things. That cost a lot of money then. Funding was not available to  do those improvements as quickly as we probably would   ve liked to.  Were you in charge of your own budgets then?  Yes. At that point when you   re the county director, that was a  responsibility.  Were you the first female county director in your county?  Yes. And there were some others in the state at that time, too, but not  very many.  Has there been one since, in your county?  No. In fact, I guess there   s only been two there, and the one that   s there  now is getting ready to retire too, so there   ll be some new people. They  only have one secretary, and they have two people in there. No, there   s  three. There   s a 4-H agent, a home economist, and a county director, an  ag agent.  Well, describe a typical day, if there was one. How early would you get  there?  Well, when I began office hours were from 8:00 to 5:00 and we worked  six days a week. The courthouse was open all day Saturday, and  eventually we began to close at noon on Saturday, and when we got to  close all day Saturday (laughs), that was quite a triumph for us. But you  spent most of your time either visiting at a club or working on program  material. At the beginning we were in the courthouse and the newspaper  office was right across the street. Every Monday morning the little lady,  she was an older lady, would come and get all of our schedules for the  week, anything that we had. We just had a weekly paper and still just put  any articles that we wanted in the paper about upcoming activities. We  didn   t have to make an effort. Now you have to call them or take it over  there, or beg them to put something in. We had it made, as far as  14  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  publicity was concerned, and they were very good at that.  Did you have to write articles regularly?  No, she wrote the articles.  No? She wrote it for you?  We just told her. Yeah. That   s until she retired, (laughs) then we had to  do that. But in the beginning that was very simple. She took the notes  and she wrote the articles.  That was a big plus.  That was a big plus. And got a lot more publicity than we do nowadays.  I guess other than just working on program material and visuals, of  course, with both groups there was lots of sewing that had to be done.  You made lots of demonstration materials like that, that you could use  year after year, as far as the 4-H projects were concerned. You made all  the little head scarves and aprons that the kids were supposed to make so  you could show them how to do it. Did it in steps, so you had like five or  six steps of it to get to the finished project.  There was a time when rural development was a real push from the state  office. We did a lot of, and that was the ag agent and the home  economist together. We had to pick what we considered a    key    person  in each community in the county and we made many visits to their  home. You know, what would you like to see done in your community,  what problems do you think you have? Is it roads, is it safety, is it a  community building? Whatever their concerns were, we did that for  several years, quite extensively, so there were a lot of home visits. Met  people who were not necessarily participants in some of our programs,  too, that was a way to meet some other people who were not extension  oriented.  And come 5:00 you could call it quits and head home?  Pretty much, no. I had a lot of clubs that met at night, so I was gone a lot  of nights. Banquets, lots of night programs. No, it was not over at 5:00.  It wasn   t a forty hour week, it doesn   t sound like, was it? Not even close.  No, it wasn   t. And I had two little kids some of those years, and I   d take  my little daughter with me, a lot of times. You ask her, she probably  remembers if they were night meetings, because we both worked outside  the home. I hated to go off in the evenings and leave the kids very many  15  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  nights a week for my husband to babysit, so we didn   t have a lot of  social life. If it wasn   t something we could take the kids with us, we  usually didn   t go, but like I said, that was part of my job. Sometimes I  would take Cara, my daughter, and leave our son home with Dad.  We   re a rodeo family, still are. My husband is eighty-two years old. He  still rides his horse every day the weather permits. Just this year he   s  quit rodeoing. He had to get a new horse, and he hasn   t got comfortable  with this new horse yet, so he hasn   t gone to any ropings. He team ropes,  and in early days calf roped. Both of our kids grew up in high school  rodeo, so we still have four horses and do a lot of that, go to lots of  rodeos, even just as watchers. (Laughs) So every weekend that was  usually something we did as a family, we   d go to a rodeo somewhere,  and when the kids were in high school and did that, my husband,  because of finances, he couldn   t rope and support two kids doing it to, so  he didn   t do a lot of rodeoing during their high school years, and just  took them where they wanted to go.  Is the daughter interested in home ec at all?  No, she   s an animal person. She graduated with an animal science  degree here from OSU and has a horse that she doesn   t ride, but she  feeds him a lot. (Laughs) They live out about eight miles southwest of  town here on ten acres, and just built a new barn. I went out there and  had to go look at the barn before I came into town. She manages and  owns a quarter horse show circuit out of Tulsa. And even though she  lives here, it   s mostly done on computer until horse show time, and then  she spends a week up there. There   s one week after the Fourth of July  and one week after Christmas. So she   s in her element, and our son is a  truck driver. He is up every night for supper. That   s another reason I  don   t like to cook, I   d kind of gotten out of doing that, and now I have to  cook an evening meal every week. And my husband still works. He  works four days a week and drives a truck.  That   s why you both are young.  Yeah, keeps us busy. I told my husband if he ever quits and sits down, I  don   t think he could get up. He   d probably be so stiff and tired he  couldn   t. So, anyway, it   s been a great life. I can   t complain. I don   t  miss the job, I miss the people.  Well I   m assuming you run into those around the grocery store.  Yes, oh yes, and I actually belong to an extension group. One little  group that, and of course you get so attached to those people that you see  every month, and I still see a lot of them. So when I retired two or three  16  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  clubs said,    Well come join us,    and I said,    No, No, I   m not going to do  this,    and I didn   t for three or four years. But one little group in a  community where my husband grew up, which is Cloud Chief, a small  little community east of Cordell, and about half the group members  belong to the same church in town that I do, so I finally joined that little  group. I promised them, I said,    Now I   m not going to probably be at  every meeting, but I   ll help you with your fair projects and with the  activities that you have, but don   t count on me for  meetings .    It was  that way at first, but now I go every month. (Laughs) So it   s fun.  What kind of fair projects do they do?  Well, they all have requirements, probably every club in every county  has a list of requirements that the clubs are required to make to have a  complete exhibit. And there   s usually canning, there   s clothing, and  there   s home improvement type things, home environment type things.  Well if your specialty   s not cooking, what do you do?  No, I don   t end up doing that, but I make a good apple pie. I win first on  my apple pie, but anything else usually is a flop. (Laughs) I usually do  some of the sewing parts. Been taking a quilting class out at Vo-Tech,  and I   ve entered a quilt every year for the last two or three years, but I   m  not going to have one this year. I haven   t done that this time. So they   re  not going to get one this year.  Hand quilt or machine?  Oh, it   s machine quilting, but you do the hand piecing. Well, not hand  piecing, but you piece them on the machine and cut the blocks out and  all that.  And then hand quilt?  No. It   s all done on machine. There   s very few people that hand quilt  anymore.  Is that something that you would teach at home demonstration? Classes  for quilting?  Yes, it was. Even though I had never made a total quilt at that time, we  had a number of quilting lessons, and we just would do blocks, and you  know, the techniques that you needed to do, cutting, accuracy, that kind  of thing. And those we hand quilted, or I did, because at that time  machine quilting was not available that easily for people. Now in every  community there   s someone that has a quilting machine. There are still  17  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  some church group ladies who do hand quilting. I know there   s a  Lutheran church in our community that a group of ladies do.  Washita County is kind of an unusual county. We have three distinct  religious groups. There was a group of Church of the First Born which I  organized the first club that they ever had and only because they had a  young lady in their community who was one of my 4-Hers, and  encouraged the ladies to join. She got to go to Washington D.C. as part  of a rural development program as a young married woman out of high  school and she had some experiences that none of that group had ever  had. She encouraged them to start their little group and they had a very  active home ec group for awhile. And then we have the Corn area, which  is a German Mennonite community, and then we had a German Catholic  community with Catholic school and Catholic church. Corn Mennonites,  they had their own school and everything, too. So, three really distinct  ethnic groups in our county.  And you had to work with all of them?  Right, right. And they were all very, very good people. The Corn people  especially, the Mennonites are very, very talented people, and the  Church of the First Born are, they   re beautiful. They   re artists, they   re  beautiful seamstresses. They upholster, they   re carpenters. There   s just  not any trade that that group of people doesn   t do, more so than the other  areas that I   m in. Really a neat group of people.  Would you get phone calls on,    Well this has happened, how do I do        Yes, and for probably ten years after I retired I got those phone calls. I  don   t think I   ve had one in quite awhile now.  What was perhaps one of the oddest ones?  An odd one? I don   t know. Usually they were canning types, and that   s  something I never did as a homemaker myself, but I grew up doing that  as a 4-Her and my mother, but because of where we lived and the  circumstances we didn   t have a big garden and I didn   t preserve food  that way. If anything, I froze it, and I taught classes, and I went to a lot  of classes and learned newer techniques and things that had been proven  to be better ways of doing stuff like that and the requirements for fair  exhibits and so forth. And so, I could usually answer their questions. I  had good reference books. (Laughs) Even though I hadn   t personally  done a lot of it.  Well in the late    50s then, what were some of the main things that you  did teach?  18  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  They   re still just basic homemaking skills. Even those ladies who were  so much older than I, they probably knew all that. There   s always a new  way, a new idea for maybe home decoration, home improvement type  things, curtains. We did a lot of sewing type things, more household  stuff, but we always had a lesson on sewing, maybe a new machine  came out, or maybe a new, better way to do your hemming stitch. Then  the sergers came, and different techniques of seam finishes     You had to constantly be learning something new yourself, it sounds like.  Yeah, sure did. And food preparation, even though they knew, maybe  quiche. Quiches were real popular for a while, crepes were real popular  for awhile. You know, they hadn   t done those kinds of things, maybe, so  we   d have classes on those. Bread making, the younger homemakers  probably never made bread from scratch. I didn   t as a homemaker either,  but I did a lot of teaching. (Laughs) Acted like I knew what I was doing.  Everything like that I practiced at home. I mean, I didn   t go in there  empty handed. I may work on it for a week, you know, make bread for a  week or whatever was required. My husband was really good about  eating whatever I fixed. I   d ask him,    How was it,    and he   d say,     Well,    he   d always eat it, but he   d say,    Maybe you don   t want to fix  that again.    (Laughs) You know, if it was a dish he didn   t like or  whatever the lesson had to be on, but yeah, you did a lot of homework,  getting ready for the lessons.  Did you have to teach them how to cut up a chicken?  I don   t think I ever did that.  I   m assuming you had to do some of that yourself growing up.  I did, oh I did. I learned to cut up a chicken very well. I wouldn   t clean  them. (Laughs) I   d help pick the feathers off and singe them to get the,  whatever you call the little things off, but I wouldn   t clean them out.  And my mother used to wring their necks, or she   d stand on their feet  and pull their neck up and cut it off with a butcher knife. If we bought  500, half of those would be fryers that we   d kill, and we   d probably  dress 100 to keep ourselves and sell the rest of them. So we did a lot of  that at home growing up. Yeah.  Well once they did that, were they frozen?  Yeah, we froze them. And even before we had deep freezes at home,  there were locker plants in the towns where you could rent a locker.  Wherever the ice plant was, had lockers.  19  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  And Cordell had one?  No, but Fredrick had one, near where I grew up. So we rented a locker  there, until eventually they got a home deep freeze.  And you went to county fairs yourself?  Oh yeah, oh yeah. And because health was my project in high school, I  usually had some kind of an educational exhibit that I prepared in  relation to the health, you know, because there   s not a whole lot you can  show in relation to   well, you could do foods, sewing, not a whole lot  you can do with that. So we did lots of educational type exhibits, and  had lots of clinics. Tillman County had a County Health Department, so  I worked with the county health nurse. They   d come out and give  immunizations, and all kinds of testings, and I always showed up at  those and had pictures made. You kept these 4-H record books, and I  still have mine. (Laughs)  Where are those now?  In my 4-H record book.  If you decide you don   t want them anymore, you can send them our way.  Well I would. Actually, last year was the hundredth year of 4-H, and so  the county fairs, probably every county had some kind of special exhibit,  and they asked me to bring my record book. And they sure don   t look  like record books today. (Laughs)  Did you have to do monthly reports or annual reports?  Monthly reports, which were not bad. Used to have to do a lot of writing  with our monthly reports. It was numerous pages, besides number pages,  but eventually this got to be basically numbers. But the annual report  was a pain, and that was the thing I probably disliked the most, was  doing the annual report. And the annual plan of work. Now the report  was not so bad, because you recorded what you had done, and you could  accumulate that from your monthly reports. But then you had to plan  your whole next year in advance, that was hard. I didn   t enjoy doing  that.  And are those some of the records that you have, or are they     No, no, those are in the extension office. I don   t have anything like that.  Do they still have anything like that from the    50s or    60s?  20  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  I   m sure they do, yeah. Well, you know, I don   t know. They probably  were when I left, but that   s been twenty years ago, different people  there. I don   t know whether they   ve saved things, how far back they   ve  saved things. There   s probably yearbooks from the homemakers     programs. I know there   s yearbooks from every year. We did a yearbook  and had it printed, with a monthly page, and that was the other thing you  had to do a year in advance. You had to pick your programs, at that point  we picked a song, we picked a devotional, we picked the topics, if it was  new ideas in clothing, we had to list four or five topics under there. Now  they have a name, maybe, and that   s all for the month, in the program  book. (Laughs) It   s on making cookies, or whatever the lesson is that  month. And so they don   t do the work in preparation in advance that we  had to do.  They taught you this in school, or did you have to learn that on the job?  I learned that on the job. I started to work under a, well, she was a young  lady, her name was also Virginia. She was Virginia Fite at that time. She  wasn   t married either, and had grown up as a 4-Her in Greer County and  she was a good teacher. She was there about two years and then she  married and left, and I had an older lady who came in as the home  economist, or home demonstration agent. Then I worked under her for a  number of years, and she was a very, very sweet, very talented, very  knowledgeable lady. So I had some good teachers. And the county agent  at that time, when I first started we were in the courthouse. (Laughs) I  guess he   d already had some bad experiences with some of the young  home economists, but he kept very good track of me. You didn   t read  the weekly newspaper at your desk. He moved his desk so he could see  my desk and make sure he could see what I was doing. And just really  kept good tabs on me. (Laughs)  We were always a really congenial office, and I know that wasn   t true of  some of the county offices. This was always a good working  relationship. And I can only remember getting chewed out one time  from a 4-H leader. She called and she thought I was paying more  attention to one club and giving them more opportunities to do things  than I was her group. (Laughs) So I had to kind of smooth the waters  over there, but as a whole it was a very good experience and I can   t  complain about any of it.  You had to be on the road a lot, though?  We were on the road a lot. Then we came to Stillwater a lot more than  they do now. We had a district meeting, usually in Lawton. How often  did we do that, every quarter or something, and they don   t do that  anymore. Yeah, we were on the road a lot. We came to Stillwater a lot  21  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  more than they do now, and even though I had my bachelor   s degree  from here, I got my master   s from Southwestern. I took most of my  classes like on Fridays, drove to  Stillwater  every Friday for six months  or a semester. We   d usually car pool, a bunch of us would be doing that  the same way. So I did that for like two years, and the county office  allowed me to. You got two weeks educational leave, so we   d take those  two weeks, and then I would take a half a day and take all my annual  leave, however many weeks that would give me, and I   d go half a day to  Weatherford. Anyway, got it without really taking much time off, so  they were very good to work with me on things like that.  Was it in education or something like that?  It was in adult education, yes.  And what year did you finish that?  Let   s see. My kids were probably twelve and fourteen, so that was  probably    70s sometime, late    70s early    80s maybe.  Did that get you a pay raise?  Yes, it did. I think  5,000 they gave me, if you got your master   s. And  that   s probably the only reason I pursued it, really, was to get a little  more money. And before I retired the gentleman that was our district  agent, he worked very hard to see the last few years I worked that I got  some pretty good adjustments with my salary before I retired. And now I  think, probably, their starting salary is more than I worked thirty-four  years for. But that   s okay. It was plenty of compensation at the time.  Well, did any of your young 4-Hers, or the young kids that you worked  with, go on and follow in your footsteps?   I know of one, Mary Sue McBroom. She even went to the state  extension office.  I know a number of them are in home economics. One  young lady even teaches home ec at the women   s college at Denton,  Texas, and several of them in high school, home ec teachers, and that  kind of thing.  Inspired others.  I did. I did. And I   m not trying to be boastful, but I have a lot of former  4-Hers who remember me and are very complimentary, so that   s very  pleasing.  Well when you go through the grocery store, are you critical of the meat  22  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  as you go by?  No, no. (Laughs) Like I said, food   s not my thing. No, I don   t criticize  that. I   m more particular about going out to a restaurant and seeing  somebody picking up the glass by the top or where they set the table or  that kind of thing. We did a lot of work like that, we had training for  waitresses and stuff, some of our extra activities sometime. It   s a  versatile program, lots and lots of different things.  Well you would have to go out to quite a few farms, too?  Oh yes, and again, that   s something I did a lot of one-on-one work with  the 4-H girls, especially. Especially those who had record books, helping  them with their reporting and also trying to come up with ideas of  activities that they could do that would enhance their records in  whatever area they were working on. So yeah, we did a lot of one-on-one,  usually after school, so that made it later getting home sometimes,  and a lot of summer things for them. Homemakers, probably other than  meeting, most of the groups met in homes, however we had several  communities that had clubhouses that they met in. You got to know  them personally and know their families and so you did that a lot of  days. And for years, the meeting was at 2:00, about 4:00 they   d have  refreshments, I still have to have something at 4:00 every day. (Laughs)  Blame that on them for treating me all those years with goodies.  At least you didn   t gain weight.  I   ve been very fortunate, maybe I have good genes. I don   t know. That   s  not, after babies it was work to get it back down.  Well early on, did you have to wear certain gloves, or have a uniform or  anything like that?  When we came to state meetings, we had to have a hat and gloves, and I  did not belong to the state association of home economists, or whatever  it was called at that time, for several years. The older lady who came to  my county after about the third year that I was there, she was very active  in the state organization, so the first meeting I came to she informed me  I had to have a hat and gloves. I think I brought them, but I   m not real  sure that I ever put them on. (Laughs)  I was active in that, in fact, I was our state president for two years, in  maybe    80 or    81. I was trying to think the other night, I know I had a  major illness and was in the hospital about three weeks during my  presidency. I was at Oklahoma City two of those weeks, and I know they  would come and bring me papers, and    What are we going to do,    the  23  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  state meeting was coming up in a couple of months, and we hadn   t done  all this planning and stuff. I thought,    Leave me alone, I   m sick     That  was fun. And you worked your way up in that, too. You were secretary,  and vice president, and so on, worked your way up to president in the  state associations.  Then you went to national ones, too, I assume.  Yes, went to national several times, not as many as I would   ve liked to  have. I can remember going to Atlanta, Georgia, to Denver, Colorado,  went to Portland, Oregon. The first one I ever went to was Phoenix,  Arizona, there was three of us drove together, I had a brand new car, so  we took my car. My daughter was just barely a year old, left her with her  grandmother and her daddy. I found out later, and of course the son was  older, he was four, he   d go down and eat supper every night with  grandma. Then he   d leave the kids down there, (laughs) so he wouldn   t  bring them home so he wouldn   t have to get them ready to go to work  the next morning. It was his mom. Those were fun times, going to the  national meetings. And we usually drove, I think there was only, the one  at Portland   s the only one we ever flew to. Went to St. Paul, Minnesota  once. Never been back east any, east never has appealed to me. I   d  rather go west.  At these meetings, at the national level, did they have training? Would  you learn how to do something new there?  I don   t think you would call them training meetings. They were just  educational sessions with speakers on maybe a topic that was the current  thing at that particular time of the year, or the season, or whatever.  I was just thinking when polyester became popular if you had to learn  anything. That was a whole different     Yes, that was, and I made all my own clothes, everything. When  polyester was popular in what we call the sheaths, or the chemises, you  know, just no waistlines, I   d make a dress one night and wear it to work  the next day. (Laughs) Because you could do that. You didn   t have to  finish the seams, because they wouldn   t ravel, and you know, just all  kinds, patterns were simple, so I had lots of new dresses. (Laughs) I  could do that then. And you know, as strange as it was, as much as I  liked to sew, I never owned a sewing machine until I retired because the  office had one, and I would use the office machine. I   d just take it home  and keep it until somebody else wanted to borrow it.  That   s a nice perk.  24  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  It was a nice perk. The county provided part of our funding then. Of  course I still have my state insurance, federal insurance, which is a perk.  That   s nice. When you first started, was more than one person  interviewed for the position?  You know, I really don   t know. There could   ve been. I was not aware.  Do you remember how you learned that that position was open?  Through the state Extension office, up here in Stillwater.  So you just went and told them     I   m sure that   s where I must   ve turned in my application. I just honestly  don   t remember that part. I just remember the people that took me up  there. But, I   m sure that   s where it came from, and then because I had an  opportunity, I mean, because I indicated what part of the state I   d like to  go to, I did my practice teaching in a little community up in the  northeastern part of the state. Well that   s so different from the very  southwest part. I actually applied for several, and in fact I interviewed  for the teaching job up there, and I had an opportunity to go to Clayton,  New Mexico, and some other places. My parents discouraged me from  that. My mother said,    We lived in Clayton for a year or two    while she  was growing up, and she said,    You don   t want to go out there.     (Laughs) But that   s the kind of country I like. I think I would have liked  it out there. We couldn   t go back to our home county, but this was as  close to home as I could get, and very much like where I grew up.  Do you have a special memory or two? Something that just stands out as  something     From my working days? Well, not really.  Any    ah-ha    moments?  Oh, I   m sure there were some of those, but like I said, this many years  since, I don   t know, it was just a good time. I did get the Distinguished  Service Award for the State Association. They presented that to me at  Portland that time, and that was a neat experience. The other home  economists who went with us that time were really gracious to me and  nice. That was kind of a nice    ah-ha    moment. Working with the ladies,  they were just all special. I just loved every one of them, and there   s still  a lot of them around. Like I said, I see them in the grocery store, see  them shopping, see them out eating, so it   s a special group.  25  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  One young lady, the one I mentioned that had been a 4-Her, then  married right out of high school and got the Extension group started in  her community, began her own business, which was kind of rare in the  early    90s. She got right of way for fiber-optic telephone cables, and  putting up cellular telephone towers, and she worked for like AT T and  Bell and all those companies. She worked all over the United States. I  started to work for her January 1, 1991, the day my retirement became  official. I went to work in southeast Kansas with her, and that particular  job was getting right-of-way to put up cellular telephone towers. My job  was to go to the courthouse, engineers had done the plotting, where the  towers should go, ideally, and then we had to find out who owned the  land where they had picked and get some adjacent land in case that land  owner wouldn   t. We had to go to the courthouse and find out who  owned that spot of land that they picked out, and then we had to contact  the owners and get them to sign a lease contract, if they would. So I  worked for her, off and on probably five, six, seven, eight years and here  she   d been my little 4-H girl, so that was a treat. And did most of the  work in Kansas, worked all over Kansas except the northeast, did one  summer in Colorado. I   d work three days then go home and spend four  days, then I   d go back and work three days  So you really didn   t retire.  No, really didn   t. But that was a fun job. Met lots of neat people over the  whole country. I discovered that homeowners who don   t know you will  tell you anything, I guess because they think,    I don   t know her and she  isn   t going to repeat this.    (Laughs) So you really hear some stories  about family problems and issues going on in the nation, just a neat  experience. I miss not doing that, and we got a lot of right-of-way to lay  fiber optic cables, some of it to schools, to put in talkback TV and that  kind of thing, but mostly    did some railway work even one time. But  that was interesting.  You mentioned earlier that you did newspaper advertisement type  things. Did you do radio?  No, because we didn   t have access to anything out where we were at that  time. One time the district arranged for us to go to Lawton and we did  some videos. I think every home economist had to work up some kind of  program and make a video presentation. I think that was probably shown  over the TV channel in Lawton at that time. No, I didn   t do radio  programs.  Did you have to be the judge at fairs?  Oh yes. Lots of that.  26  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  In your county or other counties?  Other counties. You didn   t judge in your own county, because you knew  the people.  Makes sense.  And they still call me to judge. Not as much as they did, the new young  ladies don   t know who I am, so that   s good. (Laughs)  So you   d taste, or you   d check out stitches, or what?  All of it.  All of it?  All of it. Right now they usually put me on canning, (laughs) and baking  is usually what I ended up doing most of the time.  And how often would that be? In the fall, I know that     In the fall, every county has a fair, and they all fall within a month of  each other, so you know, you would go to maybe three or four fairs at  most, probably. And I just went to one this year, up in the panhandle, up  to Beaver County.  That   s got to be fun, too.  It is, because one of the young ladies I worked with for years and retired  quite a time after I did, Barbara Hatfield, who was the 4-H person, and  she did take my position when I retired for a time, and then she was the  district 4-H agent, and she lives in Arapaho, which is about twenty miles  from me, so we go do things like that together a lot of times. I   ve got  acquainted with the younger, newer agents that are in this county.  It sounds like you   ve got quite a network.  There is, there really is, yeah. Because a lot of retired agents live out in  my area that I see every once in awhile, that I   ve worked with or worked  in other counties, cooperated with them in some way.  Would you do it all over again?  Probably would, yeah. Probably would. I at first wondered if maybe I  made a mistake in not being a classroom teacher, but I learned pretty  quick. I did have the opportunity, after several years, to teach home ec  27  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  in the high school there at Cordell. But I decided the freedom that we  had, I mean, if you needed to walk out and go to the fabric shop and see  what was new, or get some new notions, or talk to the lady who owned  the shop, or you needed to run and do this, you could do that. You can   t  walk out of the classroom and do that. (Laughs) So, there   s a lot of perks  that way. And even though I think a lot of whoever the charge person is  in that office may have some rules about coffee breaks and things like  that, I think we probably abused them sometimes, but I think we made  up for it by the evening hours that we worked and other things that we  did beyond our 8:00-5:00 work. Now I think they open at 8:30 and close  at 4:30, so the days are getting shorter. I don   t know if they work on  Fridays or not, but times have certainly changed that way.  Do you go to the association meetings still?  I did for awhile, but the last few years I have not gone. It   s coming right  up, in fact I have the invitation in the mail just last week, but I   m  probably not going this year. We have a retired, what we call FEW,  which, Betty  Dahms Lewis  probably mentioned that, F-E-W   Faithful  Extension Workers. I belong to that, and last year when my very dear  coworkers in another county who lives it Ft. Cobb, it was in her home,  and I didn   t get to go because I   m on our electric co-op board of  directors, and that was the day we meet once a month, and I   m pretty  well obligated to go to that. And I get paid for that. (Laughs) So I had to  write Mary Jean  Easterling  a note and apologize for not getting to go to  her house, but I try to get to those every once in awhile. I don   t go every  year, but I know most of the ladies there.  I should back up again. You retired in    91 and then you went to do the  Kansas type work for five or six, seven years, and then what?  Well, I   m active in my church, there   s always something going on there.  I   m president of our Methodist Women   s group. I   m on the co-op board.  I deliver Meals-on-Wheels, and we do that by church, so whenever it   s  our church   s time, that   s my responsibility for our church. So that  doesn   t come around but once every six or seven weeks. There   s enough  churches in the community or other organizations that do it. Then you do  it for a week. Tuesdays is lunch day with the girls. There   s a bunch of us  meet for lunch, sometimes there   s just two, sometimes there   s ten. Just  whoever   s available. Most of us are retired. There   s just one lady that   s  with the group that   s not, former teachers, former whatever. Most of  them are teachers, so that   s a fun thing to do.  Because I have a son living close by, there   s always some errands to run  for him, or I dog sit, he has a dog. So I have a grand-dog. I have no  grandchildren, which I   m missing.  28  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Is the farm still producing something, or is it just idle     It has grass on most of it. There   s only eighty acres that I   m responsible  for anymore, and about thirty of that needs to be planted into something.  This has fallen in my responsibility this year, and because I live so far  away it   s hard to make connections to get somebody to do those things.  So that   s an added responsibility right now, to take care of those kinds of  things.  You   ve had organizational skills all along, so I guess you can juggle  well.  Yeah, I   m really good at making lists. I have lists everywhere, and if I  don   t look at my lists, which is like not looking this morning before I left  about the cake     Was that something you would teach the clubs, too? How to organize?  Oh yeah, oh yeah. Sure was. Did home management classes. Sure did,  programs, not classes, but programs.  And did you teach them to plan a week   s menu at a time, or     Talked about that, grocery shopping. Back in the    80s when we had an  energy crunch like we   re doing now, we talked much about conserving  home energy because the price of electricity just keeps going up.  I can remember so well one woman who was a retired farm wife said,    I  worked all my life to afford the luxuries I have now, and I don   t care  how much it costs. (Laughs) I   m going to do it the way I want to do it.     And she couldn   t care less about trying to conserve energy or anything  like that, because she was finally to the point in her life where she could  afford a nice home, a nice refrigerator, and she was going to spend what  she wanted to with it.  So on those things, do you find yourself still applying?  Absolutely, and that   s still the things we   re preaching through the  electric co-op right now, when we do a monthly newsletter. Energy  conservation is one of the big things that we   re pushing right now.  But you   re good with people.  Well, I don   t know. That   s another job I have. I   m bailiff at district  court, when we have district court at Washita County. So that   s an  interesting job.  29  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  I have no idea what that would involve.  Well, a lot of people ask me if I carry a gun, because you see these  movies where the bailiff takes the person back to jail, but I don   t do that.  I take care of the jury. That   s my responsibility.  Ushering them in and out?  I   m ushering them in and out, and our little jury room is upstairs, so I  make coffee, I get refreshments for them, I tell them what they can and  can   t do, and I try to answer their questions. I can   t answer anything  about the case, but I mean, they can   t make phone calls or anything.  They have to be done through personnel in the court clerk   s office, and  when they select the jury I   m there to help and that kind of thing. So it   s  a fun job. You meet all kinds of neat people doing that. You hear all  kinds of interesting cases.  How did you come to do that?  Well, the young lady that was the court clerk, I don   t know, she asked  several of us in town who she knew, I wasn   t the only one, two or three  different ones did that. My very best friend did it and she didn   t want to  do it all the time, but they only have district court twice a year, and it  depends on the judge. Sometimes they pick their own bailiff. She just  called me one day and asked me if I   d like to do that, and I said,    Yeah.     Give it a try.  That   s another job. Always something. Every day, there   s something.  Do you still sew any?  No. I might make things for the house. I do that kind of thing, but as far  as clothes, no. We had a tornado and about half of our home was  destroyed in, what 2002 or  200 1, so I made all new curtains, bedding,  dust ruffles, and pillow shams, and stuff like that for the house. Probably  the last extensive sewing I   ve done.  And you came into it a little bit later than when women were teaching  how to make mattresses and that sort of thing?  Oh yes, that was in the canning clubs. That was prior to my days. But a  lot of my club members had been homemakers during that time, so  they   ve shared a lot of stories. And we have pictures and things like that  in our files at the extension office of these groups meeting to do that. So  I heard a lot about it, but I never did have to do it. That   s what I said. I  30  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  don   t go back that far like you   d probably like to have in your files.  No, you   re just great. The    60s when the integration and civil rights and  all that were going on, have you anything to say about that?  No problems there. Would you believe Cordell was a community who  had never had any minority groups living in it? I understand when that  little town was organized as a city that that was an ordinance. No black  people could live there. And to this day no black people live there. And  Burns Flat, which at one time was an air force base, and also a naval  base before that, is in our county. All that housing is operated by a  Southwest Development Authority, and those houses are all for sale or  for rent, and so there are black families that live out there, but still  nobody in Cordell. So I really never, I had one junior high girl at Cordell  all the years I worked that was a black woman, so I   ve never had  minorities. There   s a lot of Spanish speaking people now, as there is  everywhere, quite a few in town, and  around  our community too, but  it   s a pretty much rural community. Because of the ethnic groups that  were already established there, years and years ago, it probably hasn   t  been integrated like some counties have.  Did you do cookbooks?  We did cookbooks. I don   t do that anymore either. Any other  organization that wants to do that sort of thing, I   m not helping them out.   Other activities that the County Extension Homemakers Council carried  out over the years included many things. As Home Economist I  coordinated these events with the help of the county council officers. We  took an annual bus trip, which started out as a day trip and ended up  being a several day event like going to Branson or San Antonio, I had  the concession stand at the county fair and spring stock shows every  year. I had quarterly county council meetings with seventy to eighty  women. We had a covered dish luncheon and an educational program  besides a business meeting.  We also did a salad luncheon and style show for the public for many  years, which was a fundraiser for the council. We would serve several  hundred people. We did    lunch and learn    programs at noon for working  women. They would bring a sack lunch, we would furnish drinks, and  we   d have about a thirty-minute program on a timely subject. And we  had special interest groups that met, for example Care Givers, etiquette  training for youth, baby sitting, etc.   I   d say you probably either know everybody in the county or know  somebody who knows the person.  31  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  I probably know more people in the county than I do in Cordell, because  of that. Probably do. It   s interesting, I knew the wife maybe, because she  belonged to one of the groups I   ve worked with, and I knew the husband  because maybe he came in the office all the time to see the ag agent, but  never put two and two together that they were husband and wife, and  sometimes when I found out I was utterly amazed.    Those two just don   t  fit. I would   ve never put them together as husband and wife.    So that  was always funny when I   d discover something like that.    You   re  Dorothy   s husband? I didn   t   I   ve never met you.    Maybe I knew him,  but lots of surprises.  Have any car trouble along the way?  I   ve been very fortunate. I have had two flats over the years, and  someone has stopped almost immediately and helped me with them. I  got a few speeding tickets over the years. That stopped when I stopped  working. First, I think I   ve only gotten stopped twice since I retired, and  this one patrolman, who was a local fellow, he said,    You just don   t  drive as fast as you used to when you worked, do you?    I said,    No, I  don   t. I was always in a hurry to get where I was going.     So these speeding tickets were during work hours?  Yeah. Usually because I was rushing to a meeting because I was     And that comes out of your own pocket. Can   t turn it in.  That comes out of my pocket, you   re right. So I did have a few of those.  But I was really fortunate I didn   t have any car trouble. I never had a car  growing up, never had a car in college. My dad bought my first car, a  1957 Plymouth with these big fins on the back, solid black sport car. I  didn   t have a radio in it, so after I finally earned some money I got a  radio put in, got two antennas up on the tail fins, and that was like the     57 Chevrolets at that time, they were such a popular model. I was  noticed in town with my little black Plymouth and my fins and my radio  aerials on the fins of my car. So I paid him back  100 dollars a month  until I had it paid for, and the last  100 he sent back to me. So that   s  how I got my first car.  And this was while you were working, or     Yeah. I started to work        after college?  Yeah, after college. I started to work, and you had to have a car to work.  32  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  That was a requirement because you had to be out in the county.  So the sports car was the one you went     Well he picked it out. My family drove Plymouths, and this was a  demonstrator, and I think he got a good price on it at the dealership in  Frederick and he got it for me like two weeks before I started to work. I  got a little upstairs apartment in town with a lady who owned it beneath.  I think I made just like about  300 a month or something, it wasn   t very  much, but it did what I needed to do. Paid my rent, paid my car payment,  paid my utilities, and I had spending money.  And you worked a couple years before you got married?  Yes. Worked about two years.  And how did you meet your husband?  Well, there was a little drive-in joint on Main Street where everybody  congregated in the evenings. They had one row of barstools in them, just  a little caf  . There was one of those on Main Street, and they had a car  hop, and that   s where all the young people just gathered in the evenings  after work. About dark, you went to Ray   s Drive-in and had a coke. And  that   s where I met him, at the drive-in. He was actually going with the  home economist that I was working with, who was another Virginia.  (Laughs) At that time.  A tangled web, here.  Yes, it did. It kind of created some problems right at first, and it wasn   t  steady or anything, but he dated every home economist, every single  person that had been there for years before that. And it was just kind of a  joke. I   d been going with him, he   d asked me to go to a rodeo with him,  he had a horse and he was a calf roper at that stage, and I did, and the  other Virginia found out about it and got pretty unhappy. I remember  telling him,    I don   t want to cause any problems between you and her or  me and her at work.    He said,    I don   t feel any strings attached  anywhere,    he said. So, we ended up marrying March 20, first day of  spring, Saturday was our anniversary. Fifty one.  Congratulations.  Thank you. It snowed and was bad all day, and we never left the house.  Didn   t even get to go out and eat, which is usually all we ever get to do.  Well you have it delayed a little bit, then.  33  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Yeah, he was a little bit older when we got married, and most of the  parents of the kids our kids    age are much younger than we are.  I know some of the counties would have adult camps, did you do that?  Yes, we did that. We went to either Quartz Mountain State Park down  by Altus. Lake Lugert had a campground, or we had a little privately  owned church camp in our county where we went, and that was a big  deal. Every summer, we   d have fifty, sixty ladies go and we would plan  our menus and cook the meals. We did our own cooking. I brought the  food and the ladies helped and we swam. I always said the ladies were  much messier to clean up with than any 4-H camp ever was, as far as  their cabins where they stayed or the restrooms or anything. It just  always blew my mind. You   d think that     They were on vacation, too.  I guess that was the philosophy, because there were a lot more picking  up and cleaning up when they left than it was with the kids. You could  tell the kids,    You   re on KP, you   ve got to clean the restroom,    or     You   re responsible for your cabin,    but you couldn   t tell the women  that, I guess.  Would it be for a whole week?  Probably not, maybe three, four days.  When did that stop, roughly?  You know, I really hadn   t thought about those camps.  Or do they still do it?  No, they haven   t done it in years. I would imagine that stopped in the     80s probably. I really don   t remember. And 4-H camps, that was  something I always had to go to, that was one thing I did not miss, when  that was not my responsibility anymore, but I had a lot of fun as a young  single agent going to 4-H camps and swimming with the kids and water  skiing and that kind of thing. That was a fun time of the year then.  I hadn   t even thought of adult camps, and someone mentioned it, so I  thought,    Well I   m going to start asking.     I had not thought about that either, but we did. We surely did.  Would you do lessons, or more fun, or     34  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  No, just fun. We might do a craft. Probably did some kind of craft  project, just like we did with the kids. And in the evenings, we might  have a film or something like that, but no, it was not educational. It was  relaxing fun time.  Would they choose their own cabin mates?  Yes, because usually two or three women from each group, or the  groups that wanted to go.  That   s a large number, though.  It was. It was a pretty good sized group. So that was fun. That was fun.  It was. I had a leader   s training meeting for every month   s lesson, and I  usually always did those unless it was something really special, maybe  where a specialist might come out or some other person who had some  expertise in the subject we were doing. And the clubs at Canute, which  were on the very west side of our county, and I had three or four clubs  there, and then Mountain View, which actually is in another county, but  I had about three clubs in that community, they got to fussing. They  didn   t want to drive to Cordell, which was maybe, at the most, fifteen or  twenty miles, if it was that far. So I would do three lessons. I would go  to Canute, and I would do one at Cordell and I would go to Mountain  View. And in that area I usually would go to some of their homes. They  would let me come to their home and do it. But at Canute, we usually  did it at the school or one of the churches or something. So, I not only  did one, I did three almost every month.  Thank goodness it was the same prep.  Yes, right. (Laughs) But if it was a food demonstration, that was a lot of  work to get all your food together and all the utensils that you needed  and everything to do it. The others were not so bad. You could pack it up  in a box and go.  Did you have to develop relationships with the business folks in each  one of these     You bet you did. And especially as a 4-H agent, because a lot of our  activities had rewards for the kids, and you solicited those from the  businesses. So yeah, especially in Cordell, they got hit a lot for,    Would  you like to contribute to this?    And I did not enjoy doing that. That got  hard to do, it really did, especially as time went on. And like I said, in  the    80s when the oil boom went bust out in our area, and everybody  was having a hard time then, I was glad not to have to do that when we  had a 4-H agent to do that.  35  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  You worked a little of the    50s, all the    60s,    70s,    80s. Was any  particular decade more fun or hard?  I think the    80s was probably the hardest. Economy-wise, at that  particular time in our area, we were losing staff in the office. I still had a  4-H agent at that time, but there were times we had only one 4-H agent  and it was a male, so I had to do the girls    side of the 4-H work plus the  home economists    work. So that was double work, which I   m sure a lot  of counties did that. A lot of counties never had more than two agents at  a time, anyway. But probably the funnest was the beginning. And I don   t  know, the last four or five years when I knew I was getting close to  retirement and I was counting down, that was a good time. I kind of  picked and chose what I wanted to do at that point.  When did you become county director? Was that in the    80s?  I didn   t do too many years of that. Yeah, it was the late    80s, probably  four or five years before I retired.  So after the tough times, a little bit.  Yeah, it was. And I know our last national meeting that I went to was in  Hawaii, and the ladies actually paid half of my fare to go, the Council,  the county organization of women. Because I knew the next year I  would be retiring, I didn   t go to any of the meetings. I just did what I  wanted to do. (Laughs) I just got really brave. I went to the banquets, but  as far as the educational meetings and the speakers, I didn   t go to  anything. I went on all the tours that they had for the men, because a lot  of the husbands go, and they plan tours just for the men. So I went to a  hog farm, I went to a dairy, I went to a greenery. We went through some  of the pineapple fields, going to these other places, but I just had the best  time with this whole busload of men. There was maybe one other lady  on the group. Learned how to get downtown, go shopping without  anybody with me, and had a good time. Shirked my duties.  You had earned it, I would suppose.  That was probably the most fun trip I ever took. I   m not afraid to go off  on my own. At that point I wasn   t, and now I   m getting really chicken. If  I haven   t been to a place before, know how to get around, I won   t go by  myself anymore. I came up here last summer, once a week for six weeks  and went to a class at the library on the Gilcrease Museum. That   s  another thing I do, I   m a docent at the Cowboy Hall of Fame in  Oklahoma City, so I go to the City once a week and do a volunteer  activity. So that   s really fun.  36  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  You   ve got more going on than you think. So do you have a calendar?  I do. I do. And if I don   t look at my calendar or have a note stuck  somewhere I   m in trouble. Yeah.  I would assume you had to have one of those while you were working,  too?  Oh absolutely, that   s where I learned it. And I   ve still got all those. I  saved them. If you want to know what happened on a such and such a  day, I can probably do that. I can find it.  I   d like to have an example. Like, a week   s worth would be great to  have.  Yeah. I think I know where those are.  So if you want to part with something like that, I   m sure it   ll be great to  go with this.  Yeah, I would do that. I think I know where they are. After I moved out  of the office because so much of the demonstration was personal stuff,  that I   d made maybe out of pocket or things that I took home with me  and stashed in my little garage. It took me probably a year or two to get  everything unboxed and find a place for it, or just decide,    I don   t need  to keep that,    and throw it away. Now, I know I have a file of very nice  letters people sent me toward the end of my career, and they   re really  neat, too.  Correspondence is coming less and less, so those are     Now with your electronic stuff, yeah, they are. I   ve saved those.  Along the way, did they continually remind you extension workers what  the philosophy was, the guiding principles of your work, or was it just  ingrained from the very beginning?  I think it   s just ingrained. I don   t remember, probably when we had the  annual conference there would be some of that, and some of the speakers  that we had. But annual conferences were fun. The evenings were fun.  Last year they had a, well I guess maybe that was in January of this year,  but at annual conference they had a reunion for all the retired people,  and I came up for that. And surprisingly there was not very many there. I  thought maybe there would be more. In fact, that   s where I saw Mary   Selk , and she asked me about this. No, I don   t really remember being  indoctrinated a lot with that philosophy. I think, like I said, you grew up  37  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  through the extension program with 4-H, and going to the extension  groups with your mom, when I was growing up, that   s just sort of  something you knew, what was behind all this and what you did. I had a  brother who was a soil conservation agent all his career, so he had a little  bit of that, too.  Made for interesting conversations around the table?  Yeah, it did. You know, I look back on my parents    upbringing, and the  hardships that they endured. They put, well my sister was the oldest,  three of us through college. They had a 160 acre farm, always had  money. We didn   t have cars, I mean none of us kids had cars growing  up, but nobody did. I mean, it wasn   t just us. My dad was really an  entrepreneur. They had the telephone office, Momma was the telephone  operator and he was the lineman. He went to automotive school in  Kansas City, by correspondence, got a certificate. This was before they  married. I gathered all this from these letters. He was the local mechanic  in the community for everybody   s car repair. He was a professional  photographer. He sold Gleaner-Baldwin combines and kept the parts,  and he did repairs on those for people. Besides farming, and he had a  filling station for awhile. He was just a multi-talented man, and I didn   t  appreciate that until many, many years later.  They   re usually humble and don   t want to tell.  Sure, but, you know, those were hard times. Then my mother, with her  upbringing. There were five of the kids came over with their parents  from Germany, my mother was the oldest. They had one child born after  they were here. My grandpa had been in the German army. Nobody  liked the Germans at that time, so they never lived in a German  community, and as soon as they learned to speak English, they did. And  my mother has told me that he always had a picture of his regiment  hanging on the wall, and if somebody came he took it down, because he  was afraid somebody would be prejudiced against that. And I think they  were kind of nomads. He never owned any land, they just kind of  roamed around as a family and worked for other farmers.  Humble beginnings.  It really was. It really was humble beginnings. I came along later in life,  and I guess I was my daddy   s girl and he took me everywhere. And I can  remember, growing up, there was a gentleman, Hollister used to be a  nice little town, had a lumber yard, had restaurants a grocery store. Had  two grain elevators and two gins, and there   s nothing there now. But I  was    Raymond Hall   s Little Worry Wart.    (Laughs) At least that   s all  this gentleman ever called me was    Raymond Hall   s Little Worry Wart     38  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  because he always had me with him, wherever he went.  Special memories. And along the way, any experience with libraries?  Not really. I can remember going to the Frederick library and checking  out fiction books, but not academically-wise, other than when I got to  college.  I remember seeing it. It   s got stairs, doesn   t it?  Yeah, it   s a pretty library. I use our library a lot at home. I don   t use the  computers, but I read a lot, so I   m in there a lot. And our old library is  the museum, and they built a new one a number of years ago, but the old  one   s there.  Well I know some of the early home demonstration clubs would help get  libraries started in different communities.  You know, we did, as far as the multi-library system. We supported that  as a group. I can remember that. We solicited people to vote and support  it. Through the extension work, we really did do that. We had one lady  in one group who was so against it, and to this day I don   t know why.  She fought us tooth and toenail, and she was a member of an extension  group, but her group didn   t support it because she didn   t. But that was  the only opposition I can remember, and it did pass, and we do have a  multi-county library now.  And she probably ended up using it.  I   m sure she did. And bless her heart, she   s probably close to 100 years  old. She   s still living.  Is she?  I know she   s still living. I don   t know for sure how old she is, but she   s  quite elderly.  I   ve covered most of my questions, is there anything that you want to  add that we haven   t touched on?  I can   t really think of anything either.  Does the county have a historian?  You know, I don   t think so.  39  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Especially with a focus on extension?  No, not that I   m aware of. Now, some local groups may have just an  individual one, but I know we never had a county one. When I retired, I  can just remember how gracious the ladies were. They did a skit and  they had written poems. It was a whole day affair at the office out at our  fair building. I think I was well accepted in the community because I had  been there so long with them. That was the other thing.  Did you have to work hard to start any clubs, or were they already in     No, I started all my night clubs, and they were usually young  homemakers who worked during the day. And it was not hard to get  them started. There was usually maybe an older group that met in the  daytime, and maybe these were children or grandchildren of people who  were already in Extension and knew about it, or they   d been in 4-H, so  no. I started several new clubs, usually for the younger homemakers.  Do you remember some of the names? I think that   s interesting what  they choose.  We had Better Homes, Better Neighbors, Homemakers, Neighborly This  and That, Helpful Neighbors. Our little club was just Cloud Chief. Hager  was a community, that was the name of one club. Canute was just  Canute Community. That was another interesting thing. Those groups of  people are Catholics, as I mentioned, most of the young ladies were, and  one lady even actually had a distillery in her house and showed us how  to make wine one night. (Laughs) And they always partied. That was  their thing. That was their evening away. They all had big families; one  lady had twelve kids. That was their night away from the family to have  their thing, and they would party. They probably stayed until midnight  when I had to leave at 9:00 or 10:00. They had a good time. And I am  still friends with a lot of those young ladies. One lady works for the  propane company, and when we call and tell them we   re out of propane,  she always has to visit with me and remind me of some things. She   s a  neat gal.  I   d imagine you have lots that were special.  Yes. And it was usually the young ladies. (Laughs) And I did have a  young group at Bessie, which was the Bessie This and That. And they  were nearly all Lutherans. And oh, they were an awful sweet bunch of  ladies. They were really kind of special.  Bessie?  40  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  That   s the name of the little town there, Bessie. Yes. We had Bessie, and  Corn, but all the rural schools that were just community schools, they   re  all gone. Like I said, Cowden and Cloud Chief.  The populations are just decreasing, or     Yes. It is. It really is. Lots of big farmers now, people that have passed  away, and it wasn   t taken over by a family member it has come up for  sale, so there   s probably half a dozen young farmers who own half the  county. And it   s that way in a lot of those counties out in southwest  Oklahoma. Just moving off the farm or they   ve passed away, and their  generation couldn   t make a living, maybe, at that time off of a farm. You  can   t make a living off of a farm unless you inherit it, because you can   t  afford to buy the equipment, number one, so     You have to have a supplemental income somewhere.  Yes. Population   s dwindling. We can see that in our electric cooperative.  The number of rural homes, we have about 8,000 meters and 3,000 and  something are occupied. The other 4,000 are unoccupied farms, which  have a security light, or maybe a water well pump, or something like  that. So that   s a pretty good indication.  Well times have definitely changed a little from when you started until  today.  Very definitely. Very definitely.  It sounds like it   s been a fascinating career.  It has been. I wouldn   t change it, really, for anything.  Rewarding in a lot of ways.  Oh yes, oh yes. Very rewarding.  Even if you don   t like to cook.  (Laughs) Yes. And maybe because, after I retired I thought I wasn   t  going to have to do that, and then when Son arrived back home I had to,  and maybe that   s why I dislike it so bad. But my husband recognizes  that; he   s real good, when we have the opportunity to go out, even if it   s  just to get a hamburger, we do. But I know not having any  grandchildren, everybody says,    You will.    And I say,    No. My  daughter here, and her husband, they do not want any children, and  that   s their choice.    I think that   s a good choice, if you don   t want them,  41  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  you don   t need them. And, so our son married a young lady who had a  son that was six years old when they married, and he pretty well raised  him, but then they   ve separated, and he   s grown and in college and on  his way. He had about half a dozen grandparents anyway, so I was kind  of way down the totem pole for him, but we kind of keep up with him.  And you have all of your former 4-H kids to take care of.  Yes. There you go. And that   s interesting, too, because they recognize  me. I know I   ve gotten older and my hair color   s changed and all this  kind of stuff, but basically I think they recognize me. I don   t know them.  A lot of them, when they   d get to high school, they   d drop out of 4-H  and join FFA, in the bigger school systems especially. And maybe I had  them third, fourth, fifth, sixth grade. They   ve grown up, they   ve gotten  older, they   ve changed. I have no idea who they are when they come up  to me, and it used to embarrass me to death, but finally now I just say,     You   re going to have to tell me who you are. I cannot think.    (Laughs)  So that   s interesting, and somebody recognizes me and I have to ask  who they are, because it   s been too many years.  And you wonder what kind of impression you left on them for them to  remember you.  Yes, there   s something that they remembered about it, wasn   t it? I can  remember in the Colony school, which Colony and Corn, two little  communities united and formed Washita High, the high school was in  one community, the grade school was in the other. And finally Colony  completely lost everything and they went to Corn. Well they have just  now, this year, voted to come to Cordell. So they   re losing their school,  too. And when a community loses their school, it just eventually fades  away. That   s what   s happened to so many of these little rural areas.  One very attractive, outstanding young lady was in the senior class,  president of our 4-H club, got killed in an airplane crash. She went  riding with her boyfriend, and there   s a lot of canyons in that area, and  they crashed in one of those canyons and it killed her. It was just a really  hard, sad time for everybody. I remember that very well. In fact, her  sister is Yvonne Kauger, who   s one of the Justices here in the Supreme  Court of Oklahoma. That   s her older sister. Colony was a historic site.  That was the Seger Colony Indian settlement, way before state-hood.  Some of the original buildings that they built for schools for the Indians  are still there, so there   s lots of history in our county.  I   ll have to visit down that way.  Yes, you need to.  42  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Now I   ve got a reason to.  I should   ve just let you come out there. I just never thought about that  part of it.  I   ll still come, though.  Well come to Cordell and holler at me and I   ll fix you a piece of pie.  Apple pie.  Apple pie. Yes. It   ll have to be apple. I don   t make cream pies. And my  husband doesn   t like cherry pies, so.  Well if there   s nothing else, our last question is a little tough, maybe.  How do you want to be remembered?  I think as somebody that did have an impact on the community, of the  farm families, particularly. Their participation in the agricultural and  home economic activities, and maybe their life was better in some way  by participating in the extension programs.  I think that it has to have been.  I hope it has been, yes. And I feel like it has been. Probably not as many,  maybe, as we   d liked to have touched, but some I did. I really feel like  it   s been.  If I do my math, over thirty years.  It was actually thirty three and a half.  So you touched a lot of lives.  And one family, one of the first things we did as a 4-H was a special  kind of training program that was organized by the state, and they  actually came out and taught the classes. It was a series of six or seven  classes, but it was for the adult leaders in the community of the 4-H  program. I was pregnant with our first child, and one of the couples who  was coming gave me a baby shower at one of the meetings. They had  gotten just a donation, everybody didn   t bring a gift, but they bought us  a real nice gift. And she, over the years, has had four kids, they   ve all  been in 4-H, still in touch with every one of those kids, they   re still in  the community and with her. She dropped our club, and she   s joined a  club again now just in the last few years. They are one of the families  that helped me survive, in beginning my career, the Church family. They  43  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  Finchum  Walker  are probably some of the ones that I   ll always remember.  Well the county was lucky to have you.  Well, I hope they feel that way, thank you.  I appreciate you coming to see me today, and telling your story.  Well thank you for inviting me. I hope that I   ve shared something that  might be worth people listening to later.  It   s been great, it really has, so thank you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
