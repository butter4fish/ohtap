 Neurohr with the Oklahoma State University Library.  Today is Thursday, February 28, 2008, and I   m at the OSU Library in  the Angie Debo Room of the Special Collections and University Archives  interviewing Mr. Max Craighead. This interview is being conducted as  part of O-STATE Stories, an oral history project of the OSU Library.  Thank you for joining us today, Mr. Craighead.  Thank you.  All right. I would like to start our interview today by finding out a little  bit about you, where you   re from originally?  I was born and reared in Buffalo, Oklahoma, born on a farm, a little  three-room house out northwest of town. When I was five or six, we  moved into town because my dad   s wheat crop was hailed out and he  had to go to town and get a job and make a living for the family. And  then we lived in Buffalo until I graduated from high school. In fact, I  was the only boy, along with five girls, who had started in the first grade  and graduated 12 years later. Of course, there were only about 30 in my  class. (Laughs)  Where is Buffalo exactly?  Buffalo is in Harper County, which is the county that the panhandle  joins onto in extreme northwestern Oklahoma.  And where did you go to school after you graduated from high school?  From high school, I had no real plans, but my best friend was going to  school at Oklahoma Baptist University (OBU) and we were active in the  Baptist church at Buffalo together and had gone all through 12 years of  school together, so I just followed him to OBU. Had no idea for any  5  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  kind of career plans, and after two years, I decided it was time to quit  and do something else where I   d get a little direction in my life. So I  worked a year and then the Korean War started so I joined the Air Force  and spent four years in the Air Force and then worked another several  months because my wife and I got married shortly before I got out of the  Air Force. And then I started at Oklahoma A M in 1955 and was here  when the name change took place. So I always say I went to Oklahoma  A M, graduated from Oklahoma State. (Laughter)  And what were you majoring in?  Forestry, all the way.  All the way.  All the way. I decided on a career and it kind of doesn   t seem normal  probably because as you know when you   re in the military you don   t  make too many decisions for yourself. You just go where they say go  and do what they say do. Well instead of going to Japan or Korea, I was  sent to Germany and then from Germany on down to North Africa at  Tripoli and spent two years overseas of my four-year enlistment time.  And then came to Oklahoma A M following military service.  Okay, so your bachelor   s degree is in?  Oh, it is in forest management.  Okay.  Forest management. I think that probably was the only option we had in  the real early days of the department. They   ve added a number of  options since then, but forest management was the degree at that point.  And who were some of your professors that you remember?  Well, I feel very privileged to have known the three original faculty  members who initiated the Forestry Department in 1946. Mr. Glen  Durrell, who was a graduate of Iowa State University, was called on by  President Henry Bennett to come to Oklahoma A M and start a forestry  school. He was the State Forester in Oklahoma City at that time and had  worked in southeastern Oklahoma prior to that for the Oklahoma  Forestry Division. Dr. Henry Bennett was one of our most famous  administrators. Mr. Durrell came to Oklahoma A M in    46 to set up and  serve as the Head of the Forestry Department. One of his original faculty  members was Dr. Michel Afanasiev,    Dr. Mike,    as we all lovingly  referred to him, was a citizen of Russia and was in fact an officer in the  6  Neurohr  Craighead  White Russian Army during the Revolution, and his wife was actually a  Russian princess, so they were a very unique, very interesting, loveable  couple. Dr. Mike passed away in 1963.  Dr. Mike had come to this country and then had gotten his doctorate   I  don   t believe it was a PhD, but it was a Doctor of Forestry I think, I   m  not positive about that, at Cornell. Then he was teaching in the Botany  Department here at A M when the department was established. The  other original faculty member was Mr. Nat Walker, who later got his  PhD. He lived here in Stillwater until he retired and then later passed  away. He had worked for the U.S. Forest Service in Colorado and then  he came to Oklahoma in 1942 or    43   somewhere along there   as  Assistant Extension Forester, a position that I then held later on. Then  when the department was formed in    46, they transferred him over to  teach in the department. So those were the three original faculty  members.  Some of the early time faculty were   I came here in 1955, so the  department had been going for nine years at that point, and those three  were on the faculty, of course. Then we had Dr. Jim Gilligan who taught  silviculture. He was in the Air Force Reserves, and he later was in  Washington, D.C. and I   ve heard that he was Assistant Undersecretary  of the Air Force for awhile, but he was here. And then Mr. Al Pakoola  had come here from the Dierks Corporation, Dierks Forests Inc. in  southeast Oklahoma. He taught some of the wood courses. Then  probably one of the most important people in the whole department was  Mrs. Mary Glover, and she was the departmental secretary   the only  secretary we had.  In fact the Forestry Department office was on the second floor of  Whitehurst just as you go up the stairs on the west end. And I   ll get into  where our classes were located and so on, if you want me to, but we  didn   t have, of course, all the buildings that we have now. The corner  where Ag Hall is now   all three wings of Ag Hall, was part of the  chicken farm   there was a big chicken wire fence all the way around  that whole corner and then there were a lot of little grey A-frame huts  for chicken houses just scattered all over that. And then to the west  where about the intersection that comes down from   that joins into  Farm Road, in front of the Colvin Center, right in there   I guess that   s  where Kerr-Drummond is now. Is that correct? Anyway, the two big  dormitories that are left   no, the   Kerr-Drummond is gone, isn   t it?  No, it   s still here.  It   s still here. All right, then it was Willham dorms, the big ones further  west. And right at that intersection there was the old Dairy Barn and it  7  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  was not a very big building, but it was the original Dairy Barn for the  campus and it still had a silo and it still had silage in the silo which  became a little rank at times. (Laughs) We had space that extended off to  the south and it was just one room with a couple of big rooms with desks  and offices   a couple of offices in the back in the storerooms. We had  all of our classes   all the forestry classes in that room out there in the  old Dairy Barn, and it was quite a hike from there to some of the classes  on campus. If somebody held you over a little bit, you just barely could  make it or maybe not make it to the next class on time because you had  to go around the chicken farm. There wasn   t any way to get through like  we can now. But the old Dairy Barn has a lot of history and a lot of  memories from people who went through out there. Ag Engineering had  the front part of the building and Forestry had the back part.  That is interesting, and the campus certainly has changed since then.  A whole lot.  Yes.  It sure did.  Well when you finished with your bachelor   s degree, then what did you  do?  When I finished the bachelor   s degree in 1958   well to back up just a  little bit   we always have a spring Forestry Awards Banquet, and that  year we happened to have it at the Elks Lodge, which is still located over  on McElroy just east of Boomer. I remember the dance was in progress  and Mr. Durrell, the head of the department, and three or four others of  us were sitting up on the stage watching people dance because I couldn   t  dance and neither could my wife so we just sat around and watched  other people have a good time. But we were sitting there talking and just  kind of out of the blue, Mr. Durrell said,    Max, how would you like to  be the next extension forester?    Well I didn   t know what an extension  forester was (Laughs) so   Mr. Rigdon was the extension forester, or had  been   the only one that had ever been employed at A M at that time     and he had retired a year earlier. So I began to look around and talked to  Mr. Rigdon a lot, talked to everyone I could   you know,    What are the  duties of an extension forester? What do you do?     I was so na  ve. I didn   t realize that 4-H was a program sponsored by  Oklahoma A M, although I   d been in 4-H for awhile as a kid, but I just  wasn   t aware of all the implications. But anyway I found out what it was  like and what the duties might be, and I decided that that would be pretty  interesting. Well, I already had a telegram from the U.S. Forest Service  8  Neurohr  offering me a job on the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas, and  that   s the only thought I   d ever given to a career was U.S. Forest  Service   that   s just where most of the graduates went at that time, only  most of them went west to where the big trees are and all the glamour of  forestry supposedly, but I   d always been inclined to want to work in the  south anyway and had worked in the south as a student one summer.  Back then it   I guess I shouldn   t say it was a requirement, but it was the  next thing to a requirement, that everybody spend at least one summer  working for a forest industry or the U.S. Forest Service or someone,  before they graduated. And so I had worked in Alabama and had thought  I   d want to work in the south, and so I looked into the job of extension  forester as much as I could and found out that it was a federal job also.  I   d have civil service, the same as with the Forest Service, and if I  wanted some time, I could transfer to the Forest Service without any loss  of time or anything.  The job was appealing to me because I remembered I had interviewed  with a representative of International Paper Company who had said,    I  won   t really have any jobs to offer, but we have good feelings and have  had very good luck with people, with our foresters we   ve hired from  Oklahoma A M and we want to maintain contact with the school  because we   re gonna have jobs in the future.    Well as I was interviewing  with him, I thought,    You know, this might be the kind of job I   d like.    I  wanted to work in the woods, but I wasn   t interested in just being out  there all the time, and I didn   t want to be in the office all the time either.  So that seemed like a good trade-off and extension appealed to me from  the same aspect.  So I took the job, graduated in about the middle of May, and took the job  starting June 1. Dr. Luther Brannon was Director of Extension at that  time and as I interviewed with him for the job he said,    We   re starting a  new program. We want to give our state specialists   ,    which was the  job I was interviewing for,       we want to give our state specialists some  experience in the county because the county office is where it   s all at.  That   s where the real crux of extension takes place.    And so he said,     We want you to go to Delaware County,    the county seat in Jay, and  that   s right on the Arkansas line in extreme eastern Oklahoma which  was a far cry from where I   d grown up and spent all my life in Buffalo  in western Oklahoma. So I went to Jay and spent one year there working  in the county agent   s office. I   ve always said it was one of the best years  I ever had and then was moved back to Stillwater to begin my job as  Assistant Extension Forester.  So let me ask a question then. When you were sent up to that area, that  was a brand new initiative that they were starting at that time?  9  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Yes, and it continued for a few years with some other state specialists  that were hired and then they discontinued the practice for some reason,  but it gave me an insight as to what extension is really all about. If you  know nothing about it except from the state aspect serving all 77  counties, then I think you lose out a great deal, and I   ve always felt like  that year in Jay really prepared me for a lifetime in extension.  What qualities do you think that he saw in you that steered you in that  direction?  I   ve wondered about that (Laughs) a lot of times. Probably one thing  was that I was older. I was 29, I guess, at that time. Of course there were  a lot of veterans in my class from the Korean War, but most of them had  gone into the service relatively soon after high school, and I had two  years after high school and then another year of work before I ever  joined the Air Force so I had some age and experience, and then I   ve  always felt like one of the main reasons was I had a good wife. (Laughs)  I   ve always felt like that   well she and Mrs. Durrell were very close,  very good friends and I just thought that Mr. Durrell thought she could  guide me through it all. So I really feel like a lot of it was because of her.  Okay. That   s really some great background information on that. Let   s  keep going chronologically here and continue on then.  All right. In Jay that very first summer, in fact, only a couple of weeks  into my employment which I started on the first of June   about the  middle of June was the date for the Oklahoma Youth Forestry Camp  which was held at Beavers Bend State Park in southeastern Oklahoma  near Broken Bow. And the only extension forester at that time was Mr.  Lee Clymer, and he was stationed at Antlers because Mr. Rigdon had  retired two years earlier than that by that time. So I gathered up four  boys from Delaware County and we went to Youth Forestry Camp down  at Beavers Bend. Had a great time and a great experience and there I got  to know Mr. Clymer who became one of my dearest friends and like a  second father to me. Had it not been for Lee, I   m not sure how things  might have gone because he steered me through a lot of difficult times. I  know one time I was getting a little discouraged because I was   in fact  at that time all the state specialists were housed in Gardiner Hall, which  is now the Art     Art Center and     Yeah, right. It had been a girls dormitory originally and my office was  up on the fourth floor and had a little dormer window about so wide   no  air conditioning, no way for the air to circulate even. Had a wooden  chair that had a crack in the center   if I moved just right it pinched me  10  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  (Laughs) on the leg, but you know it was a good beginning. I did have a  fan to blow the hot air around a little bit, but I was getting a little  discouraged because it seemed like nobody ever asked me a question  that I could give the answer to. You know, I thought I   d been through  school and I had a degree. I ought to know something about forestry, but  nobody ever asked me anything that I felt like I could give them a  definitive answer for. So I went down and I talked to E. K. Lowe, who  was the Assistant Director of Extension, and I told him my problem. He  put his hand on my shoulder in a fatherly way and he said,    Well, no  need to be discouraged at this point.    He said,    I don   t think in the  history of this organization or of extension anywhere you   ll find where  anybody was fired for saying    I don   t know,    particularly if they added     but I   ll find out for you,       and so that meant a lot to me. I found that I  could say,    No, but I   ll find out for you,    and we worked through a lot  of times that way.  That   s a good lesson.  Mr. Lowe taught me that lesson.  Did he have a connection with Edmon Low who the Library is named  for?  You know, I don   t think so. He originally was from Guthrie and had  been a county agent and then worked his way up, but I do know Edmon  Low had the Library connection   but there were some great people. I  need to tell you another little incident that (Laughs) impacted my  thinking a little bit. I smoked cigars at that time. I always had a Roi Tan  in my pockets and smoking them, and I went in for my interview with  Dr. Brannon, and Dr. Brannon smoked cigars also, but he chewed on  them more than he smoked them, and he   d smoke it awhile (Laughs) and  then it would go out and so he   d just chew on it.  We were sitting there in the interview and he had one of those big old  wide desks   it was a double desk, had drawers on both sides so two  people could work at the same desk   and he was leaning back in his  chair and we were visiting. He was twirling that cigar around and he  stuck it in his mouth, but he stuck the burned end in his mouth (Laughs)  and having been a cigar smoker, I   ve done that myself and I know what  it tastes like and it   s awful   you spit and sputter, try to get all those  ashes out. He didn   t blink an eye. He just sat right there and went right  ahead with the interview just like he had a stick of gum in his mouth,  and I thought,    Oh, boy. Anybody that has that much self-control, I  think maybe I   d like to work for him.    (Laughs)  So what kinds of things were you doing with that job at that time?  11  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Well, one of the things was   at the state level you have a lot of  responsibility and your responsibilities vary a great deal depending on  the part of the state you   re working in because in Oklahoma, now most  people don   t even think of Oklahoma as having much forest land or  being a forested state. So   because most of the real commercial forestry  is located in southeastern Oklahoma, but there   s a great deal of other  types of forestry work all through the central part of the state, what we  call the Cross Timbers. And then in the western part of the state we have  a lot of windbreaks and shelterbelts and wildlife plantings. Back then  even we did a lot of plantings for posts, to produce fence posts later on.  The trees, the seedlings, were grown by the State Division of Forestry  and they had two foresters out in the field to assist people, and then my  job was from the educational standpoint. And so, like I say, it varied  from commercial forestry to western plains forestry.  One of the things that helped me quite a lot there was I was involved  with the Great Plains Forestry Committee, which was a part of the Great  Plains Agriculture Council   and I understand that no longer exists, the  Forestry Committee   but I got to interact with people from Texas and  New Mexico up, including Canada, all through the Great Plains area of  the United States. We met annually and had excellent programs and  good attendance, and I got exposure to what happens in other parts of  the country there. So there was the plains forestry and then the  commercial forestry.  Mr. Lee Clymer was the other extension forester, and he was located at  Antlers down in the southeast part of the state, and that   s where he  wanted to be and he didn   t want to come to Stillwater under any  circumstances. He was a very highly respected forester, both personally  and professionally. He was a wonderful man, but he passed away in  1977, I believe it was, and up until that time he had been the Director of  the Youth Forestry Camp which he and Mr. Rigdon had started in 1956  at Beavers Bend. He   d been the director, and then when I came along I  became the assistant director. So then, I think it was 1974 that his health  precluded him being able to continue on an active work schedule, and so  that   s when I took over the Forestry Camp.  Was that a week-long camp?  It was a week-long camp for boys only from 14 through high school     just high school age.  And were there several sessions held during the summer or just one  session?  Just one session of a week long, and we would accept 65 boys, and  12  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  every year for   I don   t know how many years, but many years   we had  way more than we could accept. There were times when we had enough  applications to have held two camps, but we didn   t have the resources to  hold two camps.  And did the boys pay money to come to the camp?  They didn   t pay anything for the first couple or three years, but we  found that with the popularity of the camp and the number of  applications we had, that sometimes kids would decide they couldn   t  come or they were going on a vacation or something so they   d drop out  and then that would leave us with a short number and omit kids who  could have come. So we started charging a fee,  3, (Laughs) and that  made a big difference, and then we had to go up over the years. I think  about the time I retired, we were charging  25 for the week, but now  that didn   t cover very much of the cost. The forest industries of  southeast Oklahoma supported the camp very, very well. All of the  industries   we   d just write a letter and here would come a check.  You didn   t really have to fight for funding?  No, no we didn   t. We didn   t have any extra money, but we had enough  to get along each year because the industry supported us so well. I was  invited back a year ago to the camp   a year ago in June I think it was     and it was the 50th anniversary of the camp. I could hardly believe that,  but it seemed like they told me that the registration fee now was either   150 or  175, which was a far cry from     And about late    60s, early    70s, we started having girls. They applied  and we never did do anything to encourage it, but when the first  applications for girls came in, we accepted them and everything went  very well. Of course, it was a whole new ball of wax for us because  we   d been used to only boys all those years (Laughs) but we got along  just great, and the girls added really a good dimension to the camp. In  fact, we had prizes   we had classes every day and we   d put them on  trucks in the morning and send them out, a third of them, to three  different locations and then rotate Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday so  by Thursday night, they   d all been to the same place and done the same  thing, had the same instructors and the same set of exams. And then on  Friday we took all of them on a tour of the industries in the area. So then  the grades were all tallied up, and in conjunction with their regular camp  conduct and how things had gone through the week, then we chose an     outstanding camper    and down the line about ten because we had a lot  of nice prizes that were donated for the outstanding campers.  There were a few of the campers who came on to OSU and majored in  13  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  forestry, but that was not really our prime purpose in the camp. We felt  like if we could help some camper decide not to go into forestry, that  was just as important as helping them decide to choose forestry because  if we could be influential in some way in helping them make a career  choice, then that was really what the camp was all about. We had  excellent adult leaders. The county agents would come with their kids,  vo-ag teachers and parents, and we required that every cabin have an  adult leader in it, and we had a good camp. It went along very, very well.  Were there any campers that come to your mind that maybe came to  school here that you feel like that you   re especially proud of?  I could think of one, and Craig  McKinley  may know him   Steve  McIntyre. He went ahead and had a career in forestry. In fact, I saw him  at our forestry reunion at Broken Bow a year or so ago and I believe he  was retired but he had been a career forester, having gone there. Then  there was another young man in that very first group that I took from Jay  and his dad was a vo-ag teacher and, gosh, his name slips me right now,  but he went ahead with a career in forestry also, and there were a few  others who did also.  Explain, if you could, the connection   you were working in extension,  but they had the Forestry Department here at the university   if there  was interaction between the two different groups?  Well, Oklahoma State University is a land-grant university of course,  and the three main arms of the university are research and teaching and  extension. The research and the teaching basically take place on campus.  Extension is extending the university to all 77 counties of the state, and  of course there are extension programs campus-wide in business and  engineering and education and home economics and so on    they have  their extension programs. But the Agricultural Extension Service is an  arm of the USDA and so we have the same benefits in extension that  regular civil service employees have. But our job was to take the  research that was developed by the faculty and, if necessary, re-work  that into layman   s terms, and then take that out on a practical basis to the  landowners and help them with their management programs of their  forest land and some of the small industries.  We have a lot of sawmills, little sawmills around, but I was so na  ve  when I first started. I didn   t realize that Glenn Durrell in the Forestry  Department was my boss, you know, because he was the head of the  Forestry Department and I just assumed that extension was where my  loyalties lie. Well, they did, but it was through Mr. Durrell because he  had a part-time extension appointment also. But all of the agricultural  extension is tied very, very closely to the departments. And for the first  14  Neurohr  Craighead  five years, I was located over in Gardiner Hall and then in    64 when Dr.  Burr Ross was the Dean of Agriculture, the decision was made that all of  the Extension State Specialists would be moved over to and housed with  their respective departments. So I was moved over to Forestry  Department at that time.  Mr. Durrell thought that was coming but nobody knew when, and we  were in extension conference one day, a monthly function we had and  Dr. Ross said,    Well, if your department head doesn   t know that you   re  coming, you go tell them immediately that you   re gonna be moving  (Laughs) over to their department.    So I went to Mr. Durrell   s office,  and told him.    Well, all right,    but he said,    I don   t know where we   re  gonna put you,    and I was in his nice walnut-paneled office and I looked  around and I said,    Well, this looks pretty nice,    but he didn   t go for  that. (Laughs) I never did get that office. Craig had that office later on,  (Laughs) but I don   t think I could have chosen anything that I would  have enjoyed any more. I always said that I never claimed to be the most  knowledgeable or the most helpful or be the best extension specialist  around, but I, from my personal perspective, I just never could have  spent a career in anything that I enjoyed like I did, and it was all because  of the wonderful people that you had to work with, both co-workers and  the public.  One thing that I think would be good to talk about a little bit is how the  education went out at that time compared to now, and how information  is available now and how it goes out. Did you have discussions about  effective ways to get your messages to work with people? Were there  certain things that made the rounds and they didn   t work and other  things came along that did?  Yeah, I feel fortunate to have spent my time when I did because  technology I think would have overcome me that is available now. We  had   at that time we   way back we started out with what we called  bulletins primarily. You   d select a subject and then you   d try to cover  the waterfront, cover all the material on a subject in a bulletin of several  pages. And then not too long, I think it was when Dr. Gene Evans came  as Director of Extension that we switched our information technology or  information dissemination method from the bulletins to what we called     fact sheets,    and so instead of trying to tell that entire story about some  subject, you pick out the most important things and you write a one- or  two-page fact sheet about that, and there might be several fact sheets that  would be similar to cover the broad subject but you could delve more  deeply into the subject matter in just a fact sheet.  We also did radio tapes. They would send these tapes out   the Ag  Communications Department handled all that   and every month there  15  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  was a week set up where we   d make appointments and we   d go over and  we   d prepare tapes that were from two to three minutes long, and then  those would be sent out upon request to the county agent   s office. They  would get a list of everything that was available and then they would  order the ones they wanted. Then, many of the county agents, most of  them, had actual regular radio programs. So the way that operated, a  county agent could say,    Well, this is Craig McKinley. I   m county agent  of Hughes County, and this morning we have with us Max Craighead  who   s gonna talk about so-and-so,    and they   d flip the button and your  tape would start and it would appear to be a live interview or discussion  right there on the radio. I don   t know whether that   s still done at all or  not. Of course we didn   t   I retired just about the time the computers  were coming on. There were three or four, or a few, in our department  when I retired, but it was some of the more progressive people and I  knew I wasn   t gonna be around very long and so I didn   t get one until  after I retired and I   ve still never learned to use it very well.  And the year that you retired was?  1986. But computers were coming into their own about that time and  now then   you know we relied heavily on secretaries and when we  interviewed for a secretary, being able to take shorthand was a pretty  stiff requirement because that   s   and then we also later had tape  recorders. I know I carried my tape recorder with me all the time and  I   ve written a jillion letters on the tape recorder when I was driving back  and forth, and then come in and   I never was very good about being  able to get one just exactly right the first time through. So the secretary  would type up a rough copy and then you   d work it over and then get out  the final copy of your letters   thank you letters and all those kind of  things.  Did they provide you with a vehicle?  Yes, we checked vehicles out of the carpool, I guess very similar to the  way it   s done now. Or we could use our own private vehicle and they   d  pay us mileage. It was six cents a mile,  6.00 a day for meals (Laughs)  and  6.00 for a room. (Laughs) Wouldn   t go very far today, but things  are different. We made it.  So when you were having to prepare newsletters and the educational  materials, and you said that you were using research that the faculty  produced, were you interviewing the faculty or were you reading what  they wrote or was it a combination?  It was a combination plus just your interaction with them. You would  know what research each one of the faculty members were working  16  Neurohr  Craighead  on   what they were doing   so you   d keep up with them through just  personal contact and then get their research information and read it.  Then what I always did, anything that I re-did   of course you checked  with the researcher and made sure you hadn   t taken something out of  context and that you were really putting into layman   s terms what they  intended from their research, but it was a combination of all of it. And I  wasn   t in favor of moving over to the Forestry Department when they  did that because I thought that the more contact I had with other  specialists in other subject matter areas   for example, we had what was  called the plant science group and it was an agronomist and a wildlife  person and a horticulturist and forester and so on   those of us that dealt  with plants were in a group, and we put out publications as a group that  way. And so I thought well the more contact we had across-the-board  the better it would be, but I found that I was losing out on contact with  the Forestry Department with what was going on there, and so it turned  out to be the right thing to do.  Were there any particularly groundbreaking things that you helped  distribute information about or educate people about in Oklahoma that  come to your mind?  The first thing that comes to mind because it was a little spectacular was  that there was a committee assigned and it was two   we had a  gentleman at the time named Ed Roberts who was a soil conservation  specialist and then we had an agronomist who specializes in grasses and  pasture plants, and then me as a forester. And they assigned the three of  us as a committee to work on a project using airplanes to fight grass  fires. And our plant science leader, Gaylord Haynes, was a former  employee of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the TVA, and they had  been working with fertilizers and they had found that one of them was a  good fire   not prevention, I can   t think of the word I want  retardant      but it would reduce the ability of the plant to catch on fire (Laughs) is  what I   m trying to say   because it coated the plant and it takes air and  heat and fuel for a fire to occur, so if the plant was coated to where the  heat couldn   t penetrate and catch the plant on fire, then there wouldn   t  be a fire.  He was able to get us   oh, I   ve forgotten how many gallons, but a few  hundred gallons of 11-37-0 liquid fertilizer from the Tennessee Valley  Authority. I took a pick-up and went to McAlester and picked up this  great big tank of fertilizer and brought it back. So then we checked on  the crop dusting airplanes that were around the state and we got  everything all ready and they cooperated great. The planes were not  really made or designed for this but with a little adaptation it worked  well. So the first one we did, the first demonstration we put on was out  at the Stillwater Airport, and the grass was short and it went real well.  17  What we   d do is go in and cut the grass down with a mower the day  before, and then spray an 11-37-0 fertilizer boundary all around it, and  then we would set the grass on fire and as it burned then the airplanes  would come swooping in and drop their load of fertilizer on it and a big  blue smoke would go up and the fire was out and it was great.  Then the next demonstration we had was out at Kingfisher on Irwin  Bollenback   s ranch   had tall bluestem grass and everybody in the world  it seemed like showed up out there. There were TV cameras everyplace  and the wind was blowing and it was a terrible day for starting a fire,  and we almost called the thing off but Clarence Bunch said,    Well,  we   ve tried it once. Let   s see if it   ll work.    It was my job to carry the  drip torch and set the fire, so I headed out and set the fire and the flames  started going up   and here came an airplane, swooped in, dropped its  load and the fire was all out   and we did that two or three times, and the  television crews got all their film and everything worked just perfectly.  Boy, we were patting ourselves on the back, what a great deal that was.  In fact, there was a TV news program at that time, one of the more  popular ones in the country,    The Huntley-Brinkley Report      older  people remember Huntley-Brinkley. It was as popular as Dan Rather and  all (Laughs) later   but we made that show that night even. WKY sent  the film to Huntley-Brinkley, and I got home, my wife had seen me out  there with the drip torch setting the fire. So it worked great.  Well, we went along and we did a few other demonstrations and we got  down at Duncan and we were going to try a different thing. There we  were in a pasture of love grass, and anyone that knows about love grass  knows it   s a real dense, clumpy kind of a grass. It doesn   t spread in an  even carpet. It   s just an individual series of big clumps of grass   really  dense. So we did all our preparation work and we sprayed the ground.  We mowed a perimeter around it. We sprayed it, had the airplanes all  lined up to dump the fertilizer   it was a good day for burning even. So  we set it on fire. We always had fire trucks standing by also   I forgot to  mention that. And the blaze went up, airplanes came in, dropped their  fertilizer, and big clouds of blue smoke would go up and oh, we thought  we got it. And here trickles of flame would start. That grass was so  dense and so heavy that the solution wouldn   t penetrate in to actually put  the flame out. So the fire trucks came in and they were trying to put it  out. I remember these guys working so hard. They had the hoses and  they would go down the fire line and they would spin the hose around  and you   d think it   d just drown anything that was there. And about ten  feet behind the fireman here the flames would start coming again.  (Laughs) As a result, we burned off that whole 33-acre pasture that  afternoon. (Laughs) But the farmer had said that he didn   t care and I  remember he said,    Go ahead and burn it all off,    when we were getting  ready, and I remember Clarence saying,    No, we   re not gonna do that.  18  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  We   re gonna show you how to put out a fire.    Well it didn   t quite work  that way. (Laughs)  Our intent was not to start a program of actually using airplanes. Of  course, that   s done all over the world now. Airplanes are made  specifically for that   that and putting out fertilizer and everything   but  it was primarily to draw attention to the problem of grass fires and that  there   s more than one way to    skin a cat.    So airplanes might be part of  the answer, maybe not the whole thing, but I think it was very effective  from the standpoint of just drawing attention to the problem that we had.  We did about 10 demonstrations around the state and that was the only  problem we had.  What year was that? Do you remember?  That was   well, it was about   I think it was a year before I moved to  the Forestry Department so it would have been about 1963, somewhere  along in there. And we put out a brochure following that called    Using  Airplanes To Fight Grass Fires.    There   s still some of those around, I  think.  Interesting. I hope we can get one of those sometime if we don   t have  one in the collection. That would be great to go along with your story.  I may have one of those at home, I   m not sure.  That would be wonderful to have.  All right.  Yeah, that was a very interesting story.  When I got home from Duncan that night, of course I was still all smoky  and charred up, and my wife said,    Had a little problem today, didn   t  you?    (Laughter) And I said,    How did you know?    She said,    Well,  you made TV again this evening.    (Laughter) Not everything goes just  right. (Laughter)  No glory that time, I guess.  That   s right. (Laughter)  You said you thought of another story to tell?  Well, thank you. This has been an enjoyable time for me, and some  things I hadn   t thought of (Laughs) for a long time even. As I came in  19  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  today, I knew to start a little bit early, so I came on campus and I started  looking for a parking place and I finally   I have a parking permit, of  course, but just finding a spot was a problem. So I finally found a place  over west of Kerr-Drummond dormitories   and a little concerned about  parking there because it   s in the student lot, but we   ll see if anything  happens   but I have a permit.  Anyhow, as I walked back over toward the Ag Hall and then on over  here, I thought of the    old tin shed    that we used to call it. There was a  building about halfway between the Home Ec Building and Ag Hall and  back to the west just a little bit, and it was just an old tin building  probably 40 x 60 feet or something, and we kept the old green truck that  we went to summer camp in   I had not mentioned that. And the  Forestry tools and all the equipment and so on   but it was just an old tin  building right out there in what now is (Laughs) the middle of the  parking lot, and I hadn   t thought of that old building for a long time. But  that brings up the thought of the old green truck. Now that   s one of the  things that everybody that ever went to school here in forestry up  through the time they started   about    67 I think was the first time I  know of that a bus was used, and normally I didn   t go to the regular  summer camp, the Forestry Department summer camp, but I went a few  times. And the first time I went was    67 and the camp was held at  Sisters, Oregon   beautiful country     I   ve been there.  Yeah, beautiful   stayed in the ski lodge   Hoodoo Ski Lodge at Sisters,  Oregon. They actually rented a school bus from some company out there  that time, and that   s the first time I know that they didn   t use the old  green truck. But we had an old green Chevrolet truck that had staked  sides which were not solid sides, just had a board and a space about so  wide and loose and rickety, and they   d dump all of us   30 or so of us in  the back of that old truck and away we (Laughs) would go everyday in  summer camp. It   s a wonder somebody didn   t get killed. There were a  few lost hats and so on, but   and the brakes went out I know one time.  Dr. Mike was driving down in Mississippi, and we were going up and  down (Laughs) hills, but everybody remembers the old green truck, and  that   s where it was located, down there in that building, and that  memory came back as I was walking over here awhile ago.  That   s a good story, too. What about the education of foresters and the  way that   s changed? Emphases   anything like that.  Well, I think I mentioned earlier that at the time I was in school there  was only one option and that was forest management. The priority was  to produce field foresters, and Oklahoma State   Oklahoma A M had a  20  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  McKinley  Craighead  McKinley  Craighead  good reputation for producing good hardworking productive foresters. I  remember one time Mr. Durrell told us that there was a representative of  the Forest Service coming by on a certain time and everybody be on  their best behavior and so on because this gentleman   and I don   t recall  his name or position   but he had said that the Forest Service had had  such excellent experience with foresters produced from Oklahoma A M  at that time   that he just wanted to come by and see where they came  from because they were out here in the Plains   this is not supposed to  be where foresters come from   and he just was interested in seeing how  those guys were produced because they did excellent work, and I guess  he was pleased because they always had jobs for us.  Were most of the students from Oklahoma?  At that time, I think they were, and most of them were from rural areas.  You know, good    ole hardworking country boys     Do you think that   s an Oklahoma trait maybe?  Well, I   d like to think so. (Laughs) I don   t know. I suspect that other  people would have the same opinion about people in their areas, but I  think that most of us had a good work ethic and we had worked as kids  and had responsibilities and tried to do the best job we could.  You mentioned that when the first women started going to the camps and  things like that   what else as far as diversity, women, or other people  from other cultures and that kind of thing coming into the program?  What did you see or experience during your time?  One of the things I noticed right off in our camp was that the girls, like I  said, we had tests and grades. The girls started taking all the top prizes.  (Laughs) That kind of was an ego thing that males didn   t like to have to  admit, but I think they   re probably still doing that. I don   t know. Then it  wasn   t until   I don   t know when   maybe early    80   s that girls started  in the regular forestry curriculum in the department. I don   t know.     67.     67? Oh, that far back?  Was the first.  Okay. But they   ve produced some excellent women foresters who have  gone on and done really a fine job for their employers but   and that  probably stimulated a little more productivity from the men also. There  never seemed to be any friction or any problems. It was just simply that I  21  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  think that the boys realized they were being outdone and tried to keep  up, but the type of students that are produced anymore are quite different  I think from the real early days because, like I said, it was strictly field  foresters, forest management, and then there are many different options  now. I don   t even know what they all are, but there have been recreation  and economics and wood products and   oh, I can   t even think   quite a  number. So they can broaden their view and still be a graduate of the  forestry school.  I think numbers have gone way down, probably due to the economic  situation and job availability. At the time I graduated, most of us had the  option of a couple of jobs at least and we had to choose which one we  wanted, and that hasn   t existed for quite some time, which has had a  definite impact on it. And I don   t know, I couldn   t prove this, but I  suspect there are more urban kids coming into forestry anymore than  there used to be because I know they used to be pretty heavily oriented  toward the rural kids.  Well, did the    60   s influence anything in forestry in particular?  Oh, I don   t know. I was right there in the department, housed right there  in the department all the time, but I wasn   t active in a classroom  regularly and so there were a lot of things that I really wasn   t privy to  that even though it may have been going on around me, I wasn   t aware  of all of it.  Let   s talk about 4-H a little bit. You had job duties that were related in  your area?  4-H was definitely a part of my job and a part of my job that I was  always very proud of and very interested in. I know there were some  state subject matter specialists who felt like 4-H was kind of an  imposition on their time and all, but I never did feel like that. I always  felt that that was a priority actually, and I had lots of very good  experiences.  One of the things I always did   I don   t think there was a summer ever  went by that I didn   t go to one to three or four 4-H camps because the  counties    groups would have a camp somewhere in their area, and  sometimes two or three counties would go together and have a camp and  they   d invite me out to present a program on some aspect of forestry or  plant life or pressing leaves or that. Then we started a   oh, I don   t know  when it was, probably in the    60   s   we started a program of 4-H  exhibits at the county and state fairs, and of course that had to be done  from scratch, and we had to write the material and design the different  projects, like leaf collections and wood collections and various age  22  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  groups and all the requirements for each age group and all that, and  that   s still going on. In fact, I helped Craig judge the Oklahoma City and  Tulsa Fair (Laughs) last year in the fall.  What did you notice about the work that the students were doing now?  Well, I always felt like that a fair exhibit was a learning experience. It  was an educational opportunity. And in our area, of course they have  projects in everything under the sun in 4-H, but we had mostly leaf  collections and wood collections and then we had another project we  called    self-determined,    which was open-ended and allowed the student  to use their imagination and develop an exhibit that depicted some  aspect of forestry, forest science, forestry education   something that let  them develop their own projects, and there have been a lot of urban kids  that have gotten involved in that.  One thing that surprised me, normally, and I think this still holds, we  would have more exhibits from the kids in the western part of the state  than we did from the kids in the eastern part of the state where forestry  was something that was not so foreign to them. And I   ve always thought  maybe it was because they had more of an appreciation for the trees.  Having grown up in Buffalo, I   ve been asked a lot of times,    How   d you  ever get interested in forestry, coming from out in that treeless plains?    I  tell them,    Well, when my dad took us kids on a trip to Arkansas one  time and I saw a tree and I liked it,    so I (Laughs) just developed a  whole career around something that I thought I   d like to do. I think that  there are a lot of kids in kind of the same thing now. It   s a little different,  and it   s something that they can actually physically get involved with.  You would have experienced the Dust Bowl days of the 1930   s  somewhat?  I don   t really remember too much about them. I was three, four years old  I guess when most of that was going on. I remember a few things. Of  course, where I lived was hit pretty hard. In fact I mentioned, I think,  that my dad   s wheat crop was hailed out and he was a tenant farmer and  we had to move to town and him get a job in 1935,    36 maybe it was in  order to keep the things going, but you know I   m sure that changed all of  our lives considerably. But as far as individual incidents during the Dust  Bowl, I just don   t have a great recollection except my mother would  hang wet towels over the windows to try to catch some of the dust and  get a little bit of moisture in the air, but other than that, I don   t remember  much about it.  4-H Roundup, is that a statewide activity?  23  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Yes.  And I bet you might have had some experiences with that?  Well, yeah, had some. In fact, last night I went to the girls    basketball  game and I stood out in the lobby and looked at the big 4-H exhibit  that   s in the east lobby of Gallagher-Iba Arena and there were pictures  of kids coming to 4-H Roundup, I think in 1932, and they were meeting  in a big, big tent over between Hanner and Thatcher Hall somewhere I  think it was, but literally hundreds and hundreds of kids that were there.  So it   s been going on for a long time, and it   s a great activity and a great  reward for the kids activities during the year. I got to go to a national 4-  H Congress in Chicago one time, and that was a great experience where  the 4-H members from all the   the cream of the crop from all over the  country assembled, and that was wonderful.  Was that when you were in your position as extension     Yes, as extension forester. In fact, International Paper Company had a  program back then of rewarding a couple of extension foresters each  year for, I think it lasted three or four years. They would bring us in to  the national 4-H Congress, and that was in Chicago and they, of course,  paid for everything. And then in the spring they took us to New York  City and to the world headquarters of International Paper Company and  we had a good exposure up there, but that was through 4-H work, some  recognition for work done through 4-H.  What have you seen as far as changes from when you started in the  career to when you retired? What were some of the big changes? I  mean, you talked about technology a little bit     Well.  Were there some other things that come to mind?  Technology was the big thing. The differences in forest management  changed a great deal over that time.  How so?  Well, one of the big ways of timber harvesting early was just selection,  individual selection. The individual tree would be marked to cut. That  was one of the things I did with the Forest Service in Alabama was go  with the timber marker, and he had a paint gun and it would shoot paint  on the tree that was to be cut, and then he would tell me the size of the  tree and how many logs of what size could be gotten from that tree, and  24  Neurohr  Craighead  then I would record that and we   d just spend all day going through the  woods marking timbers like that. And then there came a time when there  were different types of harvesting methods. In addition to the selection  method, there was a clear-cut method which received a lot of bad  publicity at times, mostly from people who didn   t understand what it  was all about, but they would cut all of the trees on an area and then  plant them back. Weyerhaeuser got an awful lot of bad publicity when  they bought Dierks Forest in southeast Oklahoma. Had close to a million  acres altogether in Arkansas and Oklahoma and they   that was the  method of harvesting, and they were accused of being the big company  to come in from the northwest and gonna just clear the country and then  go take all their money and go back, and they didn   t understand that  before they could even begin to get around over the forest and cut  everything, that the newly-planted trees would be harvestable and there  was a second forest. And that   s what   s taken place and so there   s been a  great educational program going there, and they had a lot of problems to  start with.  There are other methods of harvesting also. The method of utilization of  the timber has greatly changed. It used to be that they would take the  logs and then all the tops and the slash and the limbs and everything  were just left in the forest, and that created more fuel for fires and so on,  but now they can use everything. Trees were harvested with chainsaws,  cut each one of them down individually. Now they have big equipment  with a sheer on the front that just snips the tree off at the bottom and  picks it up and runs it through the side and takes off all the limbs and  cuts it into proper lengths and stacks it in the back of the machine. And  there   s things way beyond that have been developed recently.  The methods of planting   not the methods but a long time ago, nearly  everything was planted on a 6 x 8 space where the rows would be eight  feet apart and the seedlings would be planted six feet apart in the rows.  Well, at that spacing, that   s much too dense when they get to be larger  trees so they have to go back and thin them out. Then they found out that  they could increase the spacing in various ways and open up the canopy  and allow more room for growth. They could, in harvesting, they could  take every other tree and they   ve just   a lot of different methods of  doing things now as opposed to just essentially one at one time.  Equipment is altogether different. They utilize everything. Products are  made from what was just waste in the past.  You mentioned the cross timbers area and Washington Irving came to  Oklahoma before it was a state in the 1800   s and he talks about the  cross timbers area in his book, A Tour on the Prairies.  Right.  25  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Tell me a little bit about the cross timbers.  Well, the cross timbers is a band of timber from   I guess it runs almost  to the lake states, I   m not sure just how far. It comes down through the  central part of the country and down across the central part of Oklahoma  and on down into Texas. And for the most part, they   re not highly-merchantable  kinds of trees. In Oklahoma, they   re mostly Post Oak and  Blackjack which have value as firewood and lower commercial  products. I   ve heard people say that they provide more than their living  space by just holding the earth together   their root systems   and so  they do have value, but they   re not highly commercial.  There are all kinds of other species that grow in those areas, but they   re  mostly poor soil sites. Most of them really are not capable of producing  a highly desirable kind of commercial product   like there   s a lot of  redcedar, and that has produced many, many problems and particularly  in recent years of an encroachment on lands. There are uses for those  kinds of products   or trees   but the quantity that   s available most often  doesn   t justify the tremendous investment in machinery and equipment  to set up a plant to produce a product from them. So it   s just not an  economical venture.  Are there any other significant experiences or events that occurred  during your time here? Any issues stand out in your mind? Did  administration get along well with everyone? The Town and Gown  relationships   anything in particular you can think of?  I think things have gone fairly smoothly, but there have been a lot of  different ways to approach things. For example, I can think of one time  when I think we only had one or two vice presidents and the  administration decided that we needed a Vice President for Agriculture  and a Vice President for Business and a Vice President for Engineering  and on down the line. So we created all that and then later it was  determined that that might not really be the way to go. So (Laughs) we  went back to different   I think we have a Vice President for Agriculture  now, is that correct? But not all the other divisions of the university have  them any more. I don   t know whether that creates any friction or not, but  I suspect it might a little bit.  I know that agriculture has always had a good reputation at Oklahoma  State because that   s one of the primary functions of the university is     the extension function is through the Agricultural Extension rather than  the University Extension because it   s a much larger staffed group, but  I   ve always been very proud to be a part of the faculty at Oklahoma  State, and chose to stay right here when I retired. My wife would like to  move and I don   t want to, so far we   re still here. (Laughs) But it   s been a  26  Neurohr  Craighead  good environment to raise our kids. Town and Gown aspects I think  have, for the most part, been handled fairly well because both of them  have great personal involvement and much to gain or lose one way or  another and for the most part, I think they   ve worked them out to the  benefit of everyone.  Okay, I have another question   and you may not even have anything on  this, but when you were talking earlier and you talked about education  of foresters and different things like that, for some reason, Smokey the  Bear came to my mind and that whole campaign and, I suspect that you  might have a little bit of knowledge about the history of that, do you?  Smokey Bear originated   let me see,    60,    62, about    61 or somewhere  right along in there. There was a forest fire in New Mexico, and when  the fire was over, a ranger found a little cub bear up in a blackened  stump of a tree. And he got him down and they took care of him and he  went to the Washington Zoo, spent his life there as Smokey the Bear     as the original Smokey.  In fact, he came through Oklahoma and we got to see him at Oklahoma  City because at that time, in    62, we put up a forestry exhibit at the  Oklahoma State Fair, and I remember Sandy Saunders was a manager of  the fair at that time and he wanted a big forestry exhibit. I   m not sure  how this all developed, but it just snowballed and just   and in fact, we  developed   built   and Dierks Forest at that time, later Weyerhaeuser,  just devoted untold man hours, assigned people to work full-time on that  exhibit. We had   oh, my, sixteen separate exhibit areas and they were  something like eighteen feet long and eight feet deep. In fact, we have a  movie of the whole thing,    A Forest for your Future    it was called.  I know I made 23 trips to Oklahoma City during the month of September  (Laughs) working on that. I   ll never forget that. But it was in the Ag  Building and it encompassed this whole thing, and then we built a big  Smokey Bear to put on a big steel mast section that was outside, and it  took 20 sheets of 4 x 8 foot plywood to build that Smokey Bear. And we  laid all those plywood sheets out on the floor in the building and then  Bill Watson, who was an illustrator for the Extension Service here, drew  us a Smokey Bear on there to proportion and then we cut that all out and  made it into sections and bolted them together and put that thing up. And  Harry Rossoll, who was the originator of the artwork, at least for  Smokey Bear   I know he and his assistant spent six weeks in Oklahoma  City just doing paintings. I   d like for you to see   maybe that   s  something that we could get in this collection is the   I think I have a set  of the slides at home, but I   m not sure I still have one of the movies. It  was really a big thing.  27  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  But Smokey the Bear, I don   t know. I   ve heard that attitudes have  changed and maybe he kind of out-did his usefulness over the years, but  he was very useful for a long period of time in bringing awareness to the  fact that forest fires was a big problem and that people were the primary  problem in creating the fires in the first place and that there was  something that they could do about it. But, you know, fire is a good  management tool in forestry and so it   s not necessarily all a bad thing.  Smokey Bear brought the forestry profession a lot of publicity over the  years at least. I   ve had the experience of wearing the Smokey Bear  costume several times and I would not wish that off on anyone. (Laughs)  That   s the hottest     Why is that?  Oh, it   s hot and stinky (Laughs) in that big    ole furry   but kids really  get a big kick out of it, and that was primarily what it was developed for.  Do you think that had an impact on future marketing or promotion or  coming up with slogans and     Oh, it probably did        stickers and other things like that?     because there was Smokey the Bear. There   s Woodsy Owl. There   s  one that a forester in southeast Oklahoma, Quintus Herron, developed  called Tree Bear. There   s another one or two even   I can   t think   but I  think it had an impact across the board. Not just on forestry but in  conservation and awareness.  Okay. What is your proudest accomplishment of your career?  Well, I haven   t been accused of not being able to hold a job because  (Laughter) I had that one for 28 years and I think the fact that I had the  good fortune of   through no effort on my own or no intuition or no  intelligence or anything else from my standpoint, but just the good  fortune of having come along at the right time and the good fortune of  being in the right place at the right time to be selected for that position,  one which I didn   t even know existed hardly and it turned out to be  something that I totally enjoyed. I would hate to be in a position of  getting up in the morning and thinking,    Well, I   ve got to go in to work  today and      ole boring time.    No, I don   t think there was ever a time  that I didn   t look forward to the day because there was always  something different and new, and new people to meet and new activities  to enjoy. And I   ve always thought that being around the people that I  was around was really a blessing and something that I was very  28  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  Neurohr  Craighead  fortunate to have experienced.  Is there anything else you want to add to the interview?  I can   t think of anything right now. I would just say that somebody else  who experienced these same things may have remembered them  altogether different than I do. (Laughter)  Well this is your interview, so these are your memories. (Laughter)  I   m writing my life history now and I   m     Oh, you are?     and I   ve been working on it three or four years. I   ll do a little bit now  and then   and I   ve already got a little prologue in there that I     disclaimer, and that   s exactly what I said that,    You may not remember  these things the way I do, but this is my story and I   m gonna tell it the  way I remember it.    (Laughter)  I think that   s just fine.  All right.  I thank you very much. I think this has been a terrific interview.  Well, I thank you for the opportunity. It   s been fun. I kept trying to  think,    How can I prepare for this?    and I decided there wasn   t any way  I could prepare. I   m sure before I get back to my pick-up I   ll think of a  dozen things that I should have said.  -------  -------
