Tahi L. Mottl: Melnea A. Cass:
[On a bright winter morning, Tahi Mottl is sitting with Mrs. Cass at her dining room table.] What is your full name, your birth date and birthplace?
My name is Melnea Agnes Cass, and my birth date is June 16, 1896. I was born in Richmond, Virginia.
And were you born in a hospital, or were you born at home?
That I couldn't tell you. I don't know. I imagine I was born at home because most poor people in those days had mid-wives. I heard them speak of them, and not so many doctors.
What was the name of your mother?
My mother's name was Mary Jones.
And your father?
And my father's was Albert Jones.
And how old was your mother when you were born?
Well, she was quite young, so I understand. I couldn't tell exactly, but she must have been quite young, because when she died she was about thirty-two, and at that time I was about ten or eleven.
And how about your father?
My father lived to be quite an old age. He died here in Boston, oh, about thirty years ago, I guess.
I see. Can you tell me about your parents' education?
Well, my mother and my father had a fairly good education for people at that time, because they could read and write very well, and they were intelligent. They﻿2
MAC: (cont.) were informed on things, took part in things that were going on around them, and came to Boston and brought us, because they wanted to get better circumstances for us to live under than they were living under in Richmond. So they were wide-awake people.
TLM: Did they ever tell you anything specifically about their education in Richmond? For example, how they learned to read and write— whether it was in school or at home?
MAC: Yes, both of them went to school.
TLM: How far along?
MAC: Well, I imagine both of them probably went along, say about fourth or fifth grade, something like that, because the writing... I remember my mother's writing—it was good, but there was misspelling and so forth. But good writing. And my father, too.
TLM: Do you have any examples of their writing? I mean, not right now, but I wonder whether you have something...
MAC: No, I don't think I've got anything my mother wrote on. I have a
baby picture, and I don't know whether that has it on the back. I'll show it to you. But we don't have too much of her (anything left) because when she died, I was only eleven years old, just a little girl, and we lost track, in your mind, except my father.
TLM: Yes, you were fairly young.
MAC: Yes.
TLM: Your parents, what work did they do?
MAC: My mother did domestic work. She worked in families by the day,
and she took in laundry at home to help. And my father did janitor work most all of his life. He liked it; after he got here to Boston he began to do it, and he stayed right in it even up until he died. And my mother, up until she died, was going out working in people's homes and bringing laundry home and doing it. That's how she helped.
TLM: Now, when your mother died, where was she? Did she die in Richmond, or did she die up here?
s
MAC: Oh no, she died right here in Boston.
TLM: I see.
MAC: Yes, we had been here a number of years when she died. I came when I was five, and she didn't die until I was eleven or twelve.
TLM: Do you know how your family decided to move to Boston?﻿3
MAC: Well, my mother said that she just saw that they weren't getting any place, you know, weren't making any progress there, and my father couldn't get the kind of job he wanted to do. She just didn't like the environment around her, and she thought coming North would be the thing to do and change the way of living and try to educate us up in a different atmosphere.
TLM: When you say "us"...
MAC: My sister and I. There were two of us, my sister and I.
TLM: When was your sister born? Is she older or younger?
MAC: She's two years younger than me.
TLM: What is her birth date?
MAC: I don't remember exactly her birth date, but she was two years younger than me, I know that much. I think her birthday was in August, it seems to me. She died very young, too, and her name was Elizabeth. She was named after our grandmother, whose name was Elizabeth.
TLM: What about your grandmother?
MAC: Well, one grandmother, my mother's mother, I don't remember too well. I saw her a few times. We went back to Richmond to visit, and I saw her a few times. But my father's mother lived to be quite an old lady, and we saw her several times in Richmond, when we'd go there to visit. She never came here; she wouldn't come up here. Couldn't bring her. She didn't want to come; it was too far away. Didn't travel. I guess she never traveled any place. She was a wonderful little lady. She was a missionary. She joined the Apostolic faith, and she was really a missionary, and used to preach on the street corners and all that, in Richmond, after she got to be an older woman.
TLM: I see. Whose mother was this?
MAC: My father's mother. I saw a great deal some of the things about my father, you had bringing him up and she was alone, days of the slavery...
TLM: In Richmond?
MAC: Yes, right in Virginia, in the county. I forget the place in the
county, it's in the country. And she always had a great resentment for white people, because she was... His father was the slave master, whoever he was in those times, that was her...that she had this baby born from. And she always resented it. She always had a hatred inside to a certain degree.
of her. And she told us know, what a hard time she She was a slave in the latter﻿4
TLM: You don't remember what county that was in?
MAC: No, I don't remember the county. But, it wasn't far outside of
Richmond, because she used to say it was all built up now, you know, houses and places where she was raised as a young girl. And she didn't remember her mother and her father at all, because she was sold from them at a very, very early age. And they were sold from her, and she didn't even remember them, never saw them again or anything.
TLM: Did she remember where the family was split up, where they were sold from?
MAC: Right there in Virginia, somewhere in the rural districts, on the plantation that she was on. It was in Richmond. She'd never been out of Virginia. I say Richmond, because it was outside of Richmond
some place. Because she spoke as if some parts that were Richmond now were slave plantations that just had been built up.
TLM: So when you were about five years old, your father and your mother...
MAC: ...came to Boston to live. Yes, we came here. I was five years old when I came here, and my sister evidently must have been three. Because there's two years between us.
TLM: And did you go to visit family in Richmond very often?
MAC: Not for quite a number of years. We didn't have money to go there.
But my mother always wrote to everybody down there. We had lots of relatives there. My mother did, of course, and my father did too. He didn't keep up with his relatives, but my mother did. And today we all keep up with each other; we all know each other, and we all interchange, and we're a family, cousins. Cousins and so forth.
TLM: Where are all the cousins?
MAC: In Richmond, some of them, and one or two are all around New York, and different places. Boston, some here, and all around.
TLM: Let's see, I have the name of your mother and the name of your
father; the names of your grandparents? What were your grandparents' names?
MAC: Oh, let's see. My grandmother, my father's mother, well, she was a Lizzie. We called her Aunt Lizzie, so she must have been Elizabeth. And the other one, I don't remember what her name was right now. If I could think, I would try, but I really don't think I can think of what her name was. But I do know this much about my grandmother on my mother's side. Her name was Drew. Yes, her last name was Drew, because my aunt that raised me, her name was Drew, and she never married. So I remember the family name was Drew. She was Ella Drew, my aunt that raised me.﻿5
TLM: Oh, I see. So you have an aunt. Ella Drew.
MAC: Oh, yes, my mother's name before she got married was Drew, because her sister was Drew; that's how I know it must have been the family name.
TLM: Okay. Well, tell me, your family moved to Boston when you were five. And where did you first live when you moved to Boston?
MAC: We lived in the South End.
TLM: What was the address, do you remember?
MAC: I think we lived in a big house on Hemenway Street. That was a place that people who came from the South at that time were recommended, I suppose, like a Traveler's Aid or something like that, if they didn't have anywhere to go. And in this house there were many—a great big house with a lot of families—who came from the South, until they could get places to go to live in; they didn't have any money. I suppose it could have been kept up by the city. I'm not sure, because I don't remember all that history, but I know it was a great big house. I guess it must have held thirty or forty people. And we lived in there. Our mother took us by and showed us where we used to live. And this house was there for many years, until they tore it down and built those houses on Hemenway Street now.
TLM: Do you know how long you lived there?
MAC: I don't know, but not long, because my mother said my father got a job, and she got a place to live, and we moved to Kendall Street in the South End. That is where we lived most of our lives, right on Kendall Street, which is now part of the public housing development.
TLM: Oh, I see. Did you live in an apartment house there?
MAC: Yes, we lived in an apartment house, with three families. We lived on the first floor, the one I remember very good. I remember all of them. We lived in two or three houses on that street. We lived on the first floor, and there was another family on the second, and another one on the top.
TLM: What were their names?
MAC: They were brick houses. I don't remember the names, but we lived there for a long time. We had a big yard, and we had big rooms on the first floor, and in the basement was our kitchen. You'd go down the stairs to our kitchen and outdoors to the yard. I'll never forget the beautiful yard we had—flowers, trees. My mother had a garden out there, the people had gardens, and had great big yards. We moved from that house down further to—that was number 33—we moved to number 70.﻿6
TLM: How old were you when you moved?
MAC: I went there before I was six, I guess. So probably we lived there two or three years anyway. Then we went to the other house, and that's where my mother died. So those are two houses we lived in while she was living.
TLM: Then your aunt, when did she move to Boston?
MAC: Well, she was here before my mother; she's partly the reason why my mother came. She had already come here to work, was working for a family on Beacon Street. She was the one who encouraged my mother to come. And she had met people here, just like all people do. She told them that she'd help them when they come; find them a place, and all this. So we weren't very long in that house before we had a house to go to on Kendall Street.
TLM: What is your aunt's name again?
MAC: Ella. Ella Drew. Drew, D-R-E-U. And she was really like our
mother. She was working, and she was with my mother right straight along, just helped her a lot.
TLM: Was she an older sister of your mother's?
MAC: Yes.
TLM: And how many sisters and brothers did your mother have?
MAC: That's the only one.
TLM: Oh, she had only one sister?
MAC: No, there was another sister in Richmond. She left a sister in Richmond.
TLM: And what was the other sister's name?
MAC: What is ner name now? Well, I'll think of it after a while. I'll tell you: she was Liza. Yes, Liza. All of them were Liza.
TLM: How do you spell Liza?
MAC: E-L-I-Z-A. I called her Aunt Liza. I guess, she was Elizabeth, too, but we called her Aunt Liza. We called her Liza, L-I-Z-A, Aunt Liza, because it's Eliza, I guess. Eliza, but nobody said that, they just said "Aunt Liza." That's what we called her.
TLM: And was she older or younger?﻿7
MAC: She was older. She was the oldest, and the next one, Ella, and
then my mother. My mother was the youngest. This one, that I told you was in Boston, was the middle, and the one down South was the oldest.
TLM: Were they close in age, do you happen to remember?
MAC: Well, I think they were, because they looked so much alike, and so
I don't know ages. Old people wouldn't tell you their age, you know years ago. But I could tell they were all very close in age, wasn't much difference. Because when we did go down South and meet our Aunt Liza, she was what we'd call a middle-aged woman then, growing into middle age and further. With some grown children and all that, she had quite a family.
TLM: How many children did she have? Do you know her married name?
MAC: l'homas.
TLM: And do you know how many children she had?
MAC: Oh, let's see. Moses; one we call Sissy—that's the only girl—and. Moses, Sissy, Aaron and... Well, one more. Holland. I can't think of the other boy's name. But there were four boys and one girl. Five children.
TLM: Five. So you had five cousins who were Mrs. Thomas's children. But Miss Drew...
MAC: Never married, she never married, no. Never married. When my mother passed away, she stepped in like a second mother to see that we were all right, to take care of us, and see that everything was all right. She was there. She lived where she worked, but her home was with us; this was her home when she was off from work. This was where she lived.
TLM: Oh, I see. Did she change what she was doing, did she change her work when your mother passed?
MAC: No, she kept the work just the same, because my father had somebody there taking care of us.
TLM: Oh? Would you explain that?
MAC: Well, I forget that lady who used to come there and take care of us for a while. It was a neighbor, I guess, yes. I can't remember her name. She took care of us for a while, because when my mother died, I had another little sister born, and she was a baby. She was walking around, but she was still a little baby girl, about eighteen months old or so, when my mother died. So this lady—I know who it was—Mrs. Nelson, she was just like a mother to us, and she took care of us in the daytime. My father was in and out. That's how we got along for a while.﻿8
TLM: Was Mrs. Nelson related to...
MAC: No, no. That's an old family on Kendall Street, like us. She had three children too.
TLM:	So there was another little girl.
MAC:	Yes, I had a little sister.
TLM:	Did she die early?
MAC:	No, she just died a few years ago. She grew up and married.
TLM:	So how many sisters did you have?
MAC:	Two. Two, just two sisters. There were three of us.
TLM:	Oh, I see.
MAC:	Yes, she was a baby when my mother died, but there were three of us: myself, my sister Elizabeth, and my little sister Emmazetta.
TLM: How do you spell...
MAC: Emma Z-E-T-T-A. We called her Zetta. We never called her Emma but her name was Emmazetta.
TLM: Do you remember what Zetta's birth date was?
MAC: Yes, let's see. I ought not to say that unless I look it up, but I think it was in March.
TLM: About what year?
MAC: Well, let's see. I was nine years older than her, so you can tell from that. 1896. Nine from that. That will give you her year.
TLM: I'll figure it out. [1905.] So, you were the eldest of three
children and you had two sisters. I'd like to know something about your relationship with your sisters. You were the oldest.
MAC: Well, we were very close together, and always sort of kept together and had our own little interests. My sister went to school right alongside of me, naturally, and we were just like sisters are until we grew up and got separated. We were separated later. And made it a little difficult, you know, to get together again.
TLM: How were you separated?﻿9
MAC: Well, after a few years living with my father, and that kind of situation, my aunt realized it wasn't going to work very good. She took my sister and me too, with her to Newburyport, Massachusetts, where we went to school. And we lived down there with a lady, because she [Aunt Ella Drew] felt that it was a little too much; we weren't getting the proper care that she wanted us to get. So we went down there to live with this family that she knew very well, because she worked in Newburyport in the summer for the family she worked with [in the Boston area]. She met this lady, and she said she would just take us and do everything she could for us, you know, to help her [Aunt Ella Drew], because she was quite worried about us.
TLM: What was the name of the lady?
MAC: Her name was Mrs. Smith—I forget her first name—Amy Smith, yes.
And we lived with her quite a while. After I graduated from grammar school, then we went down to visit in Virginia our relatives. She took us down, my aunt did. And while we were down there, they told her about a school, a Catholic school, at Rock Castle, Virginia. They thought it would be nice if I went there, because it would be good getting a little more education than you would get ordinarily unless you could go away to school. It was grammar school I had just graduated from.
TLM: How old were you?
MAC: Oh, I guess I must have been about twelve or thirteen.
TLM: So you went to Richmond—what was it—for the summer?
MAC: We went down there just for the summer, yes, and while we were there, they made the arrangements. My aunt went up to the school and looked at it, and decided that she would send me there. I could go because I had graduated from grammar school. Rock Castle, Virginia. So she went back and got my things all ready and everything, and I entered that school.
TLM: I see. Did you stay in Richmond before you went to the school, or did you return to Newburyport?
MAC: No, I stayed right there. And she came home with the others and got my things ready, got some things ready while I was there, and all that sort of thing. And got me ready to go. So I went up there. I went to the school too, to look at it when they went. We went up there on the train and I liked it. It was beautiful, beautiful, out in the country; a beautiful place and I liked it very much. The sisters seemed to be so nice, you know- So I went there to school in the fall, and I graduated from there in 1914. And then I came up here. Came back here because my aunt [Ella] had a home all established by that time. She had a place where she had the others.﻿10
TLM: Well, tell me a little bit about Rock Castle.
MAC: Well, it was sort of like a high school really, the status of a high school. And it taught you all kinds of things, domestic work, and also the curriculum had all kinds of subjects along with it. It taught you, oh, how to live and it gave all kinds of good training.
TLM: Do you remember any particular subjects that stand out in your mind?
MAC: Oh yes, well, all of the subjects that you had in the school, history and geography, arithmetic, -mathematics, languages—French, Spanish and Latin.
TLM: Which one was your favorite? Do you remember?
MAC: I always liked history. I wasn't much on -mathematics. We had social studies similar to what they call social studies here today, about
people ana how to live together and all that sort of thing. And a lot of churc\i history because it was a Catholic school; and a lot of Christian education.
TLM: Well, were you a Catholic?
MAC: No, I guess I did become a Catholic while I was there. But, I didn't keep it up after I came out because I didn't see where I wanted to stay with it. It had some kind of discriminatory things in it that I didn't like after I grew up.
TLM: Oh? I'm curious.
MAC: Well, of course, they had in the South... When I came home for vacations and things like that to my aunt's home, they'd go to church. You always sat in the back, and you didn't see any little colored boys up there on the altar, or anything like that. And I resented sitting in the back anyway, because we didn't do that here. No place. And I didn't like it. Those were things I didn't really like. And everything they had for the colored was separate, of course, from the white, because that was the rule of the South at that time. You had to go in under it, and not that they probably wanted to do it, but it was obligatory. They just had to do it, to answer the call of the law, you know. But they had nice Catholic churches, one or two, just for the colored and that was nice.
TLM: And where was this?
MAC: Richmond, Virginia.
TLM: Oh, this is in Richmond.
MAC: Rock Castle's only forty miles up the river, the James River, from
Richmond. That's why they liked it. I'd go home, you know; that was my home, Richmond. She had a beautiful home and everything; gardens,﻿11
MAC: (cont.) something we never saw up here. She had pigs, cows,
chickens; she had everything. A beautiful home and everything. I was a part of the family. When I was there I was part of the family.
TLM: Were there any other family members at Rock Castle?
MAC: My family? Oh no, there wasn't anybody to be there, dear; my sister came back home with my aunt [Ella] because she wanted her to graduate from grammar school just like she had me do, right up here.
TLM: So no cousins or anyone else attended the school?
MAC: Oh no, I didn't have anybody. My aunt in Richmond was educating her children, her family, in schools of Richmond. They were property owners and everything else. They didn't have to find anywhere for their children because, I just told you, they had a beautiful home, plenty of land, a farm. She didn't sell anything, but she had gardens. S! had everything, beautiful. She was well equipped. Her husband had a wonderful job, could take care of his family, educate them and everything else. They're all college-bred. A little different from me. They had a father and a mother.
TLM: Well... I sense that you feel in some ways you were sent to the school because of your family situation.
MAC: Well, because we didn't really have a headquarters, a permanent
headquarters like they had. If my mother had lived, we would have. But my father, after my mother died, he didn't seem to know how to conduct things or manage things, and my aunt wasn't pleased with the way it looked like we were going to be. She couldn't stay home every day, and she wanted us somewhere where we would be taken care of. So she was the one that really did that.
TLM: Tell me something, we were talking about the Catholic school you
attended, and I was wondering about before you went to Rock Castle and became involved in Catholicism, was your family a member of a church?
MAC: Baptist. Ebenezer Baptist Church. That's where I went all my life. Yes, I went there from a little girl. My mother was a member, took us there every Sunday. While she was living, we went there.
TLM: What is the address of the church?
MAC; Ebenezer Baptist Church? It's on West Springfield Street, I don't know what number it is, but it's still there, and it's one of the biggest Baptist churches in Boston, right today.
T^-M: I see. Were your family members in Richmond members of the Baptist church too?﻿12
MAC: Oh yes, they went to church there. My uncle was a deacon in the church, and my aunt was a member, worked in church work. All the girls and boys were members of the Sunday school and everything else. And I went there with them.
TLM: What church was that?
MAC: I can't think of the name of it now. I think it was Riverview
Baptist Church, that's what I think they called it, Riverview Baptist Church. I think that was it.
TLM; Well, while you were at school outside of Richmond, your younger sisters were in grammar school in Newburyport?
MAC: In Newburyport. Stayed right there.
TLM: And so, your Aunt Ella and your sisters were living, still living
with Mrs, Smith?
MAC: Well, my aunt didn't live with her, she lived with the people she
worked for. But she had them sort of living with [Mrs. Smith] as a home for them. That was their home.
TLM: And your father was in Boston working?
MAC: Oh yes, and he still kept his work and helped with the money, I
guess. I guess he gave my aunt the money to help with us, you know.
TLM: Where was he working in Boston, do you remember?
MAC: Oh, I don't remember so much because he went to different jobs. He once was on Columbus Avenue where they have all kinds of restaurants and all. I remember that place, it was a great big house he was janitor of. Then he had another one down on Beacon Hill and all around.
TLM: The place on Columbus Avenue, where was that?
MAC: Down near Dartmouth Street. There's a lot of stores and all there now, but when he was janitor there was a big apartment house or something right along there. They didn't have all those stores.
TLM: He worked in an apartment building, and then he worked on Beacon Hill for a while?
MAC: Oh yes, for many years. He worked at that till he died. He was quite an old man, he still was doing it.
TLM: Well, tell me, when you had vacations, while you were in school in
Virginia, going through high school, did you return to Massachusetts?﻿13
MAC: No, no- I never could afford that. That was a little too much money, you know. So I just made my home right there. Stayed there in the summertime. I'd just come home two or three weeks, say, out of the summer; we didn't come home for the whole summer. We just had to have a special consent to come out like that and visit, so my aunt would write a letter that she'd like me to visit them and I'd go.
TLM: So you'd go for a few weeks to Richmond?
MAC: Yes, just three or four weeks. Two or three weeks. And sometimes Christmas and like that.
TLM: Do you remember any friends from the school?
MAC: Friends with me? Oh, I had quite a few friends that I kept up
with. One just died. She was out in Chicago. Augusta Payne. And Gladys McAllister. She lived in Chicago too. And then there was one that—ob, /it's her name? She was in New York for a long time. She used to visit me all the time. (I get so I can't remember things.) Louise Johnson. She and I were very good pals. She lived right in New York. She would come here, make it her home whenever she got ready to. She never got married. She was an old maid, and she'd come over here and stay two and three weeks at a time with me. Whenever she wanted. She died not too long ago.
TLM: Was she a New Yorker or did she move to New York?
MAC: No, she came originally, I think, from out west, Detroit or somewhere like that, to the school. But I met her there. And we became very, very good good dear friends. Those three I kept up with very closely. And I still keep up with the family of Augusta Payne—her girls out in Chicago—I still keep up with them. We write, you know. I was out there to see them. When I was on a trip, I stopped there and saw them. They're quite a family of them. And just recently I got into contact with them; before their mother died, I visited Chicago, saw her twice. But we used to write to each other because that was the best we could do; we kept up.
TLM: You corresponded?
MAC: Oh yes, for years and years. Right straight out of the school. Yes. Tried to get her to come to Boston, and she kept saying she's coming, but she didn't. But I went to Chicago a couple of times with the conventions and things, you know, clubs that I'm in. And she was so happy to see me, I never will forget it. So of course, when I went back the last time she had passed, about two years ago.
TLM: You were there about two years ago?
MAC: Two years ago. And the girls, of course, they came to see me at the hotel where I was staying. They took me out to their houses. We just had a lovely time.﻿14
TLM: Do you know their names?
MAC: I'll tell you in a minute, they're in the book. One's name...I've got them right there...
TLM: Do you have photographs?
MAC: No, I don't have any pictures of them. One is Carol, and the other one is Muriel. Muriel Dillon and Carol—what is her last name? Well, anyway, I can tell you that, because they're in my book there. Carol Nelson. That's right. She never married. Her mother was a Nelson after she was a Payne. That's right, she was Augusta Payne Nelson. That's her married name.
TLM: How about Ms. McAllister? Did she have a married name?
MAC: Yes, yes. And I can't remember it right now. I never, you, we
forget -311 -'bout it. We just use first names. Of course, when you write to them you look the addresses up.
TLM: Now what was the date when you got your diploma from high school?
MAC: From Rock Castle? It was 1914. I don't remember the month; of
course, it's got to be May or June, that's when graduations happen. I graduated in 1914, I know that much. I was valedictorian of my class.
TLM: Oh you were? Well, tell me about that. You had excellent grades when you were...
MAC: Oh yes. Always. All the way through. I was always A or B, all four years.
TLM: Do you have any mementos from that time?
MAC: No, I don't have that. I had my little graduation thing some years ago, and I don't know what became of it. I've been looking all around for it, but it's here someplace. The graduation program. I think that we had. I don't know where that is. They had a regular ceremony. I can't think of the subject of my [valedictory] paper right now, but it will come to me pretty soon. We had the subject— I can't remember right this minute. But I might before you go.
TLM: Well, tell me also about anyone who, during that period, had an important impact on your development, your teenage years.
MAC: Well, of course, I think the whole school had a great effect on my development, because I was only just a young girl, you know, when I went there. And they had such wonderful ways of training you, you know, so that you could, really, fit into wherever you go. Because most of the girls there were probably without parents, or had one﻿15
MAC: (cont.) parent, or were very poor. They couldn't pay very much, so whatever you paid, they accepted it, which was great.
TLM: Was it mainly a school for poor girls?
MAC: Well, it's for underprivileged girls. It was founded by a young, very, very wealthy young woman who was a Catholic, one of the Katharine Drexel family out of Philadelphia, and she founded this school for Indians and black children, "colored children," because they were disadvantaged, and she wanted to help them all over the country. She just felt that... She was a very, very rich woman, and her part of her inheritance she took and put it in the school. She had one in Philadelphia which was the Mother House, they called it, where the nuns went to train, and they had one there. They've still got it, in Philadelphia. I still correspond with it. I send them a little money here and there, to help.
TLM: Did you go to that school?
MAC: No, I never was there. No, I haven't been there to visit really, I never went there but, see, it's in the city. They had it for the children all around Pennsylvania: Philadelphia and small towns. Some of those children came to Richmond, to Rock Castle to school because it had higher grades. They were there as little children, and when they'd get older, they would send them down to Rock Castle where they had a higher type education. And now they have a school, Xavier College,* in New Orleans that is a part of this whole thing, and that's college. Go from one to the other. So they really had a curriculum which taught you not only how to work and all that, but how to live, which is good for young children with no family, you know, to direct them.
TLM; Well, do you remember any teachers who may have had, who were outstanding?
MAC: Well, they had one Sister, Sister Emmanuel. She was from Boston, of course, and naturally I liked her. Because she was from Boston. And there was a Sister Frances. Those two, I think, stood out in my mind as two models of what I would like to be like. They were great women and very well educated, highly educated for that day; they'd been to college and so forth, and they had some good ideas about everything.
TLM: What in particular about them?
MAC: Well, I liked the way they would conduct the classes for you, and
give you a chance to express yourself, and they were... They would have discipline for you, but they had a different way of doing it from some of them, whom I felt were a little dictatorial, because I always resented too much anybody who would be too dictatorial to me when I was a little girl. I never liked it. I liked to say what I
* Xavier University.﻿16
MAC: (cont.) wanted to say, too. And they were like that. They'd have debates, and we could express ourselves. And that's a form of getting your expression in. And they always planned something that was interesting for you, not so dull and...that you had to... couldn't get anything out of it.
TLM: What sorts of interesting things?
MAC: Well, they used to plan our lessons in a way that we... Because
there were small classes, you know; classes were small because there weren't that many children in the school. In the school I don't think there were over two hundred; it was a small school, you know. And of course the classes would be smaller, you know, according to grades. So they had more time with you, and you could have more individual time, something like the schools are here today. You go into a classroom, you have a little bit more freedom among each other than you would if it's a whole thirty or forty, fifty kids in a room; they don't have time to bother with you.
TLM: About how many kids were in a class?
MAC: Well, I remember, hardly ever twenty. Small. Twenty-five. Of course, in different grades. You see, they started at the lower grades, and came up to the eighth or ninth, so you see they scattered according to grades. Then we had time when we did domestic work, when we learned how to keep the house and all that, because mostly colored girls at that time were hired out as domestics. So they taught us that too. So you really could do that, too, if you wanted to wait-the-table, cook. We had cooking classes. And all sorts of things that made you learn how to do things in a house, if you were going out to work in a house. It was very good, because most of us did go out and work in the houses; we who couldn't go on to college, you know. Some couldn't go to college. And then some of those girls left there and went to college; graduated. They were from families that could afford it.
TLM: Well, what was the highest grade at the school?
MAC: It went on up till high school; it was high school curriculum. You see, because grammar school, I had finished that, so this was high school curriculum. Similar to the schools in the county, they had to compete with them. And whatever the courses were, they had the same thing, right there. Everything. Latin, French, we had Latin and French and a little Spanish and languages.
TLM: Your two favorite teachers?
MAC: Well, my two were Sister Frances and also Sister Emmanuel.
What courses did Sister Frances teach?﻿17
MAC: Sister Frances was really one of the assistant superintendents, you might call her, in the way that people speak. She was a directress.
TLM: Was she from Boston?
MAC: No, only one was from Boston, that was Emmanuel. She came from
South Boston too. She was real Irish. She was a wonderful person.
TLM: Were many of the sisters at the school Irish?
MAC: Well, one or two. They were different. I think Sister Frances, she was of Italian or something. But they weren't all any one ethnic group there. They came from everywhere. They were dedicated to help the colored children and the Indians, or else they wouldn't accept them there. They had to be dedicated to those things the school was founded for in the beginning, or else they wouldn't even take them, you know. They had to go through a process of training too. Then we had one or two who were nurses. They taught us some health things, you know. There were different things. Different teachers taught different things.
TLM: What did you do when you graduated?
MAC: When I graduated, I came back home here, to Boston. My aunt had
finished up at Newburyport and had a nice home here right in Boston for us. Yes, beautiful. My sister [Zetta] graduated right here. My baby sister. One of these schools, either Hyde or one of the schools in the South End. And my sister, the one next to me, came down there to school the next year and she graduated. She came, she [my aunt] sent her down the next year. Soon as she finished things, a couple of years, finished her grammar school, she sent her there, and she also graduated from there.
TLM: Oh, there was a time when your sister was also at Rock Castle?
MAC: Yes, she came right down, went to school, she was there while I was
there. Last two years I was there, she was there. It was beautiful. She finished, I guess, a couple of years after me, and when she finished, she didn't come home. She stayed down and got a job teaching at one of the little country schools for a while, and she lived there for quite a while. She died there. She never came back here. She liked it there and she stayed.
^LM: This was your sister Elizabeth?
MAC: Yes. She stayed right there in Richmond with my same aunt. She
made her home there and worked out from there and worked at different jobs she wanted to do. She came and visited us a couple of times, but she made her home there. And she died there. Passed away there.﻿18
TLM:	I See. And did she marry?
MAC:	No.
TLM:	She never married. So you came back up here to Boston.
MAC:	Yes, I came here when I graduated.
TLM:	And was your Aunt Ella living in Boston at that time?
MAC: Yes. She had established a home here a year or two before I came.
And she had my youngest sister going to school here. Yes, my sister Zetta graduated right here in Boston, right from schools here.
TLM: And your father?
MAC: My father died. He didn't live with us. He still kept on doing his work and. stayed where be wanted to. I don't know exactly all the time where, I couldn't tell you where he lived, but he visited us. My aunt had established a lovely apartment when I came back to Boston. I didn't come right away. You know, I stayed in Richmond, too, I think, all summer and visited with them, and then came in the fall.
TLM: This was in 1914?
MAC: Yes.
TLM: And where was your aunt living? What street?
MAC: She was living on Ruggles Street. A nice apartment there. That's where we lived all the time, until some years later when we moved from there to Hammond Street. So we stayed right in that neighborhood, all the time.
TLM: What was your aunt doing in terms of work?
MAC: She was a hairdresser. After I returned home, you know, for good, to live in Boston, I looked around for jobs. I didn't know exactly what I could do, and I didn't know what the possibilities were, and different people told me different things, that knew us, you know, recommended to me to do different things. They wanted me to work in the stores, go downtown and work—they had millinery shops and stores—and put my name in different places. I didn't have much success in doing that. Only for a short time I worked in a millinery shop on Boylston Street. That was quite a thing in those days, making hats and sewing on hats.
TLM: Did you make the hats?
MAC: No, no. I just waited on some of the customers and helped them, you know. I didn't learn the trade or anything. I was more like an﻿19
MAC: (eont.) assistant, just a worker in the store. That was very nice,
but the pay was very small, and I began to get restless and wanted to (like young people are) look around and get something a little better to do. And I went in one or two stores to see if I could get a job for things they used to have colored people doing. There were no salesgirls in those days. They didn't hire them. So you'd have to work like the maid in the beauty parlor, or in the restaurant, or help to clear off the tables, or do things like that. I didn't like it. I didn't want to do that anyway. So I didn't. I finally decided the best thing to do would be to go and do housework, because I knew how to do that. And I could do it. So I did do that for several years, and in one or two places I worked I stayed there.
TLM: Can you tell me about that? First of all, how long did you work in the hat shop?
MAC: Oh, I guess afeo-at a year, pretty near a year.
TLM: And at that time you were searching around for something else?
MAC: Looking for something else, but I didn't find what I thought I should have, so I didn't take it. In between I was deciding what I would do, and finally I heard of a job, and I said, "Well, I think I'd do it," and that was to go away for the summer and try your luck. So I went down on Cape Cod to work, and I worked at Hyannis, the Inn and waited table. I liked it very much, but it was just for the summer. So while I was down there, I met people, like you always do, who lived there and were telling me about other kinds of work you could get to do there if you wanted to. And they knew of a family of people who wanted someone to come down during the summer with them. I went over to see them, and I planned to go back next summer with them. It was two sisters; I can't remember their names... Andrews. They were lovely people- I went to work for them, and I worked for them every summer, oh, for about, I guess, three or four years, and I liked them.
TLM: So you'd go and work for them on the Cape?
MAC: Yes, and then I came back. And then I would come back to Boston, and I would do day work or just take a job, a small job for the winter and know that I was going down there in the summer. So I did that for, oh, three or four years. It was very, very nice. We'd generally go down in June, about the middle of June, and come back always after Labor Day, into September, the latter part of September. I just went down there myself with some friends; some other girls who were going told me about it, other girls that went there every summer to work and told me about it, and got me a job like you have to do.
TLM: Did you stay with the two sisters for whom you were working or did you live with your friends?﻿20
MAC: Down there? They had a place you could live. I worked at Hyannis Inn and they had a beautiful cottage for the girls to live in.
TLM: Oh, but the three years that you were working...
MAC: For the [Andrews] sisters? Oh, I stayed right in the house with them. You know, I lived there. Oh, I lived with them. Another lady was the cook, and I did the other work, second work, wait the table and all kinds of things. I liked it very much, because they were lovely people. Two lovely people. But then I got tired of that in a way. You know how young people are. And I decided I didn't want to do that any more. So then I looked around to see what I could do around here, in Boston. So then I finally said, "Well, I guess I will work here." So I didn't work very long there because, you know, I had boyfriends, you know, and everything. And I had one. So the war came along, World War I. So he wanted to get married, because he thought he wouldn't come back, and this, that and the other. So I got married. So when I got married, that ended all the work business; didn't amount to anything. And I kept on working for a little while, but I didn't keep it up regular. So of course, I just took jobs and let them go. But it was always domestic work; really it was very nice places I worked, too, for some very nice people.
TLM: Well, was this right around the time that you got married?
MAC: Well, I was doing that when I got married. And I kept on doing it after I got married, and he went off to the service. I kept on working, you know, whatever I wanted to do. Some of it was part-time work. I didn't do anything steady.
TLM: Can you give me any specific names of places where you worked or families you worked for?
MAC: No, I don't remember them too good now, like I should, because it's been so long, you know; that's a long time ago.
TLM: Well, tell me about your marriage.
MAC: Well, of course, I married. The war time. I was a "war bride,"
they called them. Quite a lot of us got married, you know; we were afraid this boy wouldn't come back, and all this business, so we got married. So I married a wonderful husband. He was great. While he was at the service, I, well, my first baby was born while he was away.
TLM: Oh, please give me your husband's full name.
MAC: Marshall.
TLM: Marshall Cass. And what was the date of your marriage?﻿21
MAC: Oh, let's see. I'll have to look in my Bible there and see. I think it was 1917. I think it was 1917, right at the war, when the war was declared, right along there. He was in the service here a long time before he went away. He was up here, Camp Devens. He used to come home almost every weekend. All this, and I went to live with his mother while he was away. After I got married, I went to live with his mother, because she just felt like she'd like to have me there while he was gone. She was a wonderful person. So I did, I went and I lived with her. And I was there when the baby was born.
TLM: Okay, well, give me more specifics. You said you think the [wedding] date was in 1917, but what was the month and the day?
MAC: December. We were married Christmas.
TLM: And then how long was it before your husband went away?
MAC: Oh, he didn't go away from this country, oh, for, I guess it must
have been six, seven months or more. Maybe, I don't remember, because he was first at camp, up here at this camp here [Devens]; then he was sent to a camp down in New Jersey, and then he was sent to a camp down in—what's the place?—Kentucky I think it was, before he left. I think Camp Dix—same camp they had for World War II. Camp Dix, I think, in New Jersey. Because we went to see him over there quite a number of times, my mother-in-law and I. Went over there lots of times to see him before he left, and I didn't go to the one down South there, Kentucky or wherever it was, Breckenridge, I think it was, some funny name like that. That's where he was in Kentucky.
TLM: When you went to New Jersey, how did you get there? Did you take the train?
MAC: Oh, we went on the train. Yes, my mother-in-law went, and I went.
TLM: Tell me, Mrs. Cass, what is the name of your mother—in—law?
MAC: Rosa Brown.
TLM: And your husband was from Boston, too?
MAC: Well, he was not originally. I met him here, but they came from Philadelphia, and he incidentally, was born in Richmond too. I didn't know him. Both he and his mother were born in Richmond, and they moved to Philadelphia, and from Philadelphia they came here to Boston to live.
TLM: Do you remember, what was your husband's birth date?
MAC: Let's see, what is his birth date? I can't remember. Seems to me his birthday's in February. Well, he's a couple years older than me. I was '96, he's probably born in '94. He's a couple of years older than me.﻿22
TLM: I see. And he was born in Richmond too, and then moved to Philadelphia?
MAC: Yes, and they went to Philadelphia to live, and then his mother, and they all, his stepfather—after his father died she married again— came here to Boston. They all lived here. That's Mr. Brown who was a wonderful man, I knew him well. Yes, he's a great man.
TLM: Well, tell me, how old was your husband when the family moved to Boston?
MAC: Oh, he was grown, a young man, working and everything, when they came here. They lived most of their life in Philadelphia. He went to school there, and then Richmond...
TLM: How many brothers and sisters did he have?
MAC: Only him.
TLM: Oh, he was an only child?
MAC: Right.
TLM: And were his parents living together when you moved in to be with his mother?
MAC: But this was his stepfather that I knew, I didn't know his father. His father died in Philadelphia, I guess, years ago when he was little. And then she married Mr. Brown, and that's his stepfather. I moved in there with them after I got married. I was home awhile, and then she said, "Why don't you come and just live here with me, and then when the baby comes I can take care of it." She wanted to. So I moved there and lived there until he came home out of the service.
TLM: So, what was the birth date of your first child?
MAC: Oh, let's see now, when was he born? I think it was, his birthday
is February 20, and his birthday, I think, was 1919. I guess it was.
TLM: And what is your son's full name?
MAC: Marshall. And his middle name is Drew, after my family.
TLM: And is this the same son who lives downstairs?
MAC: Oh no, that's my son-in-law downstairs, that's my daughter downstairs. My son lives in New York, in Brooklyn. He's been there ever since he came out of the service. He was in World War II. So he married a girl and they live over there.﻿23
TLM: I see. Well, going back, when your husband was away in the army, Marshall was born, and you were living with the Browns. Were you taking care of Marshall, and were you still working at that time?
MAC: No, I didn't work any more after that. No, they wouldn't think of me working. [laughter] My mother-in-law wouldn't let me work. I had to take care of that baby. She thought that baby was just wonderful. She worked, she worked very steadily, she did day work, and of course her husband had a job. He used to be a porter on the railroad, on the New York-New Haven-Hartford, I guess, the regular line. And she worked day work for families and all that sort of thing. And I stayed home altogether. Kept the house for them and took care of the baby. Until after the service, until the war was over. When he [Mr. Cass] came home from the war. Then we went housekeeping. We got our own house. Our first house was in Sussex Street, down off of Hammond. Right around the corner from where we were living. Got a nice little house.
TLM: That was right near where the Browns lived?
MAC: Yes, right around the corner, next street around, right in the same neighborhood. They lived on Hammond, and I went on Sussex. It was just around the corner; neighborhood around the corner.
TLM: Was your Aunt Ella living, was she living in that area too?
MAC: My Aunt Ella had gone back to New York by this time and... Because she originally came from there, and she loved it so. So she died in New York.
TLM: I see. So when she came to live with your family, she had moved from Richmond to New York, and then from New York to Boston?
MAC: Yes, she lived in New York originally. She came over from New York here to Boston.
TLM:	I see. So she moved back to New York City?
MAC:	That's her old home and she belonged to the church there.
TLM:	How old was she when she moved back?
MAC:	Oh, I guess she must have been around sixty.
TLM:	I see. And was [your sister] Zetta out on her own at that time?
MAC: Oh, yes, my sister was working and...she had moved to New York with my aunt...was living with her, and settled, married and lived in New Jersey.﻿24
TLM: I see. And what was her married name?
MAC: Oh, what was her name? Fields.
TLM: She married Mr. Fields?
MAC: Yes, they divorced before she died. She died singly, by herself.
But she spent all of her adult life in New York, jobs, whatever she did... She went into the nursing field, she was a practical nurse, worked in the hospital out there in Brooklyn, that was her field.
TLM: I see. So she was living in New Jersey and worked in Brooklyn. And what did Miss Drew do?
MAC: Well my aunt did her hairdressing all her life. She was a wonderful..
TLM: So she had a shop on Mass. Ave. in Boston, and then she moved to New York...
MAC: Well, when she went to New York she just picked it up again. And went right on doing it. When she got older she stopped working altogether because she didn't have to be working. When she died she wasn't doing any particular thing.
TLM: Well, how long was she...if she moved to New York when she was in her sixties... Was she in her sixties?
MAC: Oh no, no, when she... When you asked me... What did you ask me?
TLM: How old Miss Drew was when she left Boston and moved to New York.
MAC: Oh, I don't know. She was a young woman when she left Richmond
to go to New York to live, because she was very young, just like my mother. But then of course, she'd be along in age when she went back to New York; in her forties or something like that, fifties, early fifties.
TLM: Was it around the time of World War I that she went to New York?
MAC: Yes, right around World War I, she went back to stay, and stayed
until she died. That's right. And she had a nice apartment of her own there and did her work, and my sister used to live in and out. My sister did housework too in New York for a while, and then she went to school and became a practical nurse. Then she went into nursing and got her own apartment and took care of herself. Until she died.
TLM: So then [after the war] you moved to Sussex Street?
MAC: Yes, that's where I went, housekeeping. That was my first house,
to live in as a war bride and so forth and we stayed there and lived in that house until we came out here and bought this house. Forty-seven years I've been here.﻿25
TLM: How long was it that you were living in Sussex Street before you moved here?
MAC: Oh, I guess we came out here, let's see, forty years... Right
after the war was over we went into that house; now when was the war over? That's what you have to figure. I don't even remember. I don't remember whether it was 1920 or was it 1919? It was 1919 we went there, a couple of months after my husband came home, we found that place and we went right in then, so we say we went there ...let's say we went there in 1920 even. We stayed there—and we've been out here forty-seven, so...deduct that from it—we stayed there quite a while.
TLM: You stayed there until 1930, about ten years?
MAC: It must have been. Would that thirty make it up to '77 now, for the forty-seven years? Well, we were all around there. We stayed right
th»re
TLM: Stayed right there in the same place? So were all of your children born while you were on Sussex?
MAC: Yes, all of them were born right there. Of course, except the
oldest one, he was born before we got there. But the other two, I had two more children, that's all, and they were born around there I have three children. Three. Two daughters and a son.
TLM: One question that I would like to ask you about yourself, and then
I want to know about your children. Was Marshall born at home or in the hospital?
MAC: Born in the hospital.
TLM: What hospital?
MAC: New England.
TLM: New England? And what about your daughters?
MAC: All of them. All of them. New England Hospital for Women [and
Children] right up here on Dimock Street. All three were born there
TLM: Did you have the same obstetrician or pediatrician?
MAC: Oh no, that's a hospital, you know, where you have whatever doctor's available when you go there. You don't have any special doctor. You just have the doctor that's there, because that was a hospital for women and children. And years later, they were like students that had gone on, and you'd have whatever doctor's on that service when you go there. I don't even remember any of the doctors' names or anything.﻿26
TLM: What were the birth dates of your daughters?
MAC: Well now, let's see. Marianne was born on May 23. I can't
remember the years, child. You got to find that out, and I can't remember that.
TLM: Oh? First Marshall, and then Marianne?
MAC: Yes, and then Melanie. I just have to go by how old they are and find out what their ages are. Marshall, my son...
TLM: 1919.
MAC: 1919, how old does that make him? I can tell you better. 1977? Figure that out. Because I think he's fifty-nine or sixty.
TLM: Yes, fifty-eight.
MAC: Fifty-nine, he says he is. They all got their ages straight and I tell them, and they say they're more than they are or I have them more. Well, then now between Marianne and him, there's two years, so what year would that be for her?
TLM: Well, that would make... Well, if he was born in 1919, then she would be...
MAC: In '21, about '21, I guess.
TLM: '21? And then how about Melanie?
MAC: Melanie, probably about two or three years apart. She's along there, too. She's about forty-seven, I guess, or forty-eight, wouldn't she be? '77?
TLM: So she was born before you moved here?
MAC: They [my daughters] were born there, that's where they were born.
She was a little girl, just walking around good when she come out here.
TLM: Okay, we took a little coffee break and now we're back. MAC: Back, that's right.
TLM: I wanted to ask you some things about influences on your life up until the point where we left off. We left off at the part where you were beginning to raise a family. I asked you before that about﻿27
TLM: (cont.) individuals who influenced your life, important individuals. And I'd like to know, up until this point, this was after World War I and you were starting to have kids, were there any other influential individuals in your life, you'd say?
MAC: Other than my family, you mean? My aunt. My mother-in-law was one, of course, after I went to live with her. She was a great influence because she was a great lady. She was a little different from my aunt. She was a community person, a civic leader, a worker in the NAACP, in church work and all sorts of community things. She was a community leader in this area, Rosa Brown, and a church leader of the Saint Mark Congregational Church. That's how I happened to join the Saint Mark Congregational Church, through her, her persuasion. And my children went there to Sunday school and it became my church because of her. And she had a great influence on me, especially with community activities. Voting—she persuaded me to go out and vote. Soon after women got the vote. They were scared to death. And of course, a lot of poor white women were scared to death too. Because they felt that if they voted it might affect their husbands' jobs or some other repercussions, 'cause that's what they were telling them. They didn't have thevote, women, you know, in the beginning, because they fought to get the vote, the suffragettes, so I voted.
TLM: So Mrs. Brown was with an organization...
MAC: She was a leader.
TLM: ...that had to do with the votes.
MAC: And NAACP led in it and the club women, the black club women, the church women, all of them were out in those times.
TLM: What particular clubs did Mrs. Brown belong to?
MAC: Well, she belonged to the one that I'm now president of, the Women's Service Club of Boston, which is about sixty years old, it's been active in Boston; and of course she was a leader in the NAACP and [National] Equal Rights League with Trotter, and many other kinds of organizations of that type who were out struggling for rights of the colored people during that era.
TLM: Tell me about the Trotter group.
MAC: William Monroe Trotter?
TLM: Yes. Your mother-in-law was involved...
MAC: Well, she was one of the followers with him in the Equal Rights
League, which was founded by William Monroe Trotter who, you know, was a great leader here in Boston, editor of The Guardian and also graduate of Harvard, summa cum laude, honorable mention. And when﻿28
MAC: (cont.) he graduated, he couldn't even get a job to do what he
wanted, no place, because he was a colored man. So he immediately went into working for himself and to protest that. He founded The Guardian paper, and established that so he could speak through it to the people on their rights, and how they were denied them and so forth, and discrimination and all that...
TLM: Did you read that newspaper at all?
MAC: Oh, yes. I read it all the time. We had it every week in our house because my mother-in-law was one of the supporters of that paper, helped him to get it printed; financially, they raised money so he could print it. She was one of the people that helped with it. We had that paper in our house every week. And I still had it up until it went out of existence, after he died. But that was a paper similar to The Banner today. It was the only paper black people had in this community that would say what they wanted to say in it, because the others wouldn't say it in the paper. All they'd print was something that was derogatory, that "colored" or "black,or whatever you want to be called today, did. We were "colored" in those days, because that didn't...we knew nothing about being "black So, but anyway, far as getting back to it, he was a man who believed in equality for everybody, regardless. So that was his working life He opened doors to many things, helped to get jobs, and he helped to make black people understand what their rights were, and to go forth to the legislature and try to get them. And he preceded the NAACP here in Boston, you know. His group was ahead of them. And he led marches and protests down in Tremont Temple all the time when they lynched Negroes down South. We'd have a big mass meeting right in Tremont Temple, and let everybody know it, and petition the government about it. The United States government.
TLM: Oh, did you ever participate in these?
MAC: Oh, I went to them. I used to go to all of them, most every one they had. I don't remember speaking in any of them, but I was a follower, I'd be sitting there listening to what they had to say.
TLM: Was this before World War I?
MAC: Oh, this was after, I guess, after World War I. Straight on up
till almost now, not too long ago you had to still do it, you know, even when Martin Luther King was coming. Of course he [Trotter] died before Martin Luther King, but he was a leader, you know, during all those times.
TLM: During the time of Trotter, did you go on your own or did Mrs. Brown go?
MAC: No, I'd go with my friends. I'd take my friends. I had loads of friends here in Boston. I grew up here. Women like myself that wanted to do the same thing. No, I didn't ever have to go alone,﻿29
MAC: (cont.) we'd get together and go. Just like you go any other place. If you're going some place, like to a show or anything, you get someone, if you want, to go with you. And we'd go together, go to meetings together.
TLM: Did you also, in addition to... Well, you went to some of the Trotter meetings and...
MAC: Oh yes, well, the Trotter meetings were held in churches all
around here, because he didn't have anywhere else to hold them, and we all would go to that. The whole community would go to hear, and to get plans and to see what we could do to help the blacks in the South who were getting lynched and whose houses were getting burned down. Like you saw there in "Roots," all those kinds of things were going on then, you know. And so we had to fight them.
TLM: How often would a meeting like that be held?
MAC: Oh, just periodically; if something terrible happened, we'd call a meeting.
TLM: Maybe once a year?
MAC: Oh, twice a year, three times. Whenever they'd come. They were protest meetings. To let the government know we didn't like what was going on with the black people in the South. And some black people here, for that matter. Of course they didn't get lynched here, but they were persecuted falsely and accused of different things because they were black, and couldn't get a job because they were black. And [Trotter] held meetings for lack of work and not enough employment, and "why was it" and "what are we going to do." "Go downtown to find out why they can't get employed." Delegations would go with him.
TLM: was it mostly Trotter who organized...
MAC: Oh, he organized himself, along with some people like my mother-in-law, and other people who thought in that vein at that time, people who were... It was organized when I got in it, going along fine. A going organization.
TLM: And Mrs. Brown was a participant. Was Mr. Brown a participant?
MAC: Not so much, he didn't have time enough, and he wan't that type
anyway. But she was. She was a community person, church person. It makes a difference.
TLM: So she was sort of a role model for you?
MAC: Yes. I learned a lot of things. She'd tell me about—I learned from her—how to do things and become interested in a lot of clubs and all kinds of things. She belonged to Massachusetts State﻿30
MAC: (ccmt.) Union of Women's Clubs and all those kinds of things. She helped to found that and all kinds of things that helped to advance the people, black people.
TLM: And your mother-in-law was a member of the NAACP? When did you join the NAACP?
MAC: Oh, I don't know, dear. I joined the NAACP so long ago I forgot it. I guess quite young. I guess when, well, soon after I went to live with her, I guess I joined it. Because you couldn't be around her if you didn't join it. Something's wrong with you if you didn't join. She used to get the members to go into the street and ask people to join. She was a great worker for the NAACP.
TLM: What other organizations, do you know? Do you remember?
MAC: Well, I told you, the [National] Equal Rights League and the Women's Clubs, Women's Federated Clubs. She was the great leader in those, and helped to get those started here in Boston, and was instrumental in getting them into the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, and lots of things like that, she did. And her church work, she was a leader in her church, you see. She was the founder of the church out here. One of the founders of Saint Mark's, yes. And so of course they perpetuated her name over there now because she was really one of the founders. She worked hard for the church because it was a small church with no money and they had to raise money... Come from in Boston out here to get this church, they bought out here on Townsend Street. They came out here to this church just about the time we moved out here. They've been out here about fifty years, pretty near.
TLM: Well, we talked a little bit about Trotter. What did you hear about Booker T. Washington when you were...
MAC: Well, of course he was a great man, you know, he was one of the
greatest leaders that black people have had in his field, you know, of working...
TLM: Did you hear anything specific while you were growing up?
MAC: Well, nothing special except that he was a great man, had a school at Tuskegee, Alabama, at Tuskegee Institute; all of us knew about that and knew he was a great leader, a great man in our race. And he did come here to Boston, you know, several times to tell about his work. He believed in training people for trades and technical work, and so forth like that, but Trotter was contrary to it; he didn't like it. And he believed that they should have an education as professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, teachers, et cetera. And he [Booker T. Washington] said that that was fine, but if they had a trade they knew good and well, they could get right out and get a job, and always work, if they knew a good trade. And he believed in the crafts trades such as builders and all that sort﻿31
MAC: (cont.) of thing, technical trades. So Trotter and Washington
disagreed. They were very, very far apart on those things, so he wasn't very acceptable here in Boston with Trotter and some of his followers, for the simple reason that they felt he was antagonistic to what he [Trotter] was teaching. The two of them differed.
TLM: At that point had you heard of W.E.B. DuBois?
MAC: Well, he was a great man. He was a philosopher and a teacher and an educator, and he also founded the—what was the name of his organization? Now I can't think right this minute. He founded another type of organization, and he and Booker T. Washington didn't agree either altogether on this approach about what black people should be trained to do. Because DuBois was a great teacher and a great educator, and he believed that you should get an education to do higher skills. He didn't quite agree with him on that.
TLM: Do you remember him from that particular period?
MAC: Well, I remember him, I've seen him. I heard him speak here in Boston, I remember him.
TLM: When was that?
MAC: Oh, I don't know what year it was, a long time ago. Of course, you know it had to be a long time ago, but it was during the period of the time when we were in our equal rights and our civil rights fights; he appeared, you know...
TLM: So it was later on.
MAC: ___because he was a member of the NAACP...
TLM: It was not during the teens or twenties, it was later on?
MAC: No, I knew him from the NAACP, you see, because he was a writer
for the Crisis and all the books and magazines, he was the leader in civil rights.
TLM: How about Marcus Garvey?
MAC: Oh, I didn't know Marcus Garvey at all. I just heard about him.
My mother and all of those, I remember, way back then, my aunt and all them, they used to go to meetings for Marcus Garvey, I think; that's how far back it is. In Boston. His movement was here m Boston too, you know. He had quite a movement here amongst the people, getting ready to go back to Africa, it was called the Back to Africa movement, led by Marcus Garvey. He was here and spoke to the people here, I understand. I never saw him, but I﻿32
MAC: (cont.) heard of him and he gathered a lot of support here amongst the people. Particularly West Indian people, because he was a West Indian. And they were really moving towards helping him get th is Back to Africa movement started. I wasn't involved in it at all.
TLM: How about any women? Any well-known women that...
MAC: That I know of?
TLM: ...during that period?
MAC: Well, here in Boston there were a lot of good women like Mrs.
Harriet Hall and Mrs. Wilson, and some other women who I knew when I was coming up. They were older women and I was young; they were doing club work like my mother-in-law, for the soldiers. That's how I met these ladies. They had a hut on Columbus Avenue playground, a ki.td of a hut—it was similar to the U.S.O.—and they used to have dances and things for the boys who came in from the camp. And they had us all there, young girls, to dance with them and to be hostesses with them and all. I was one. And they used to knit at that time, make gloves and mittens, rather, and sweaters and all, and send them across as gifts, to the fellows from Boston. And then when they'd come through they'd give them one, when they got ready to go, ready to "embark" they called it, you know. And we would be there to entertain them, and sometimes take them around places and all that. And that's how I met Mrs. Wilson who was the head of that at the time, and Mrs. Hall, and my mother-in-law was one of those too. And they did that volunteer work, just to make the fellows who came here from other places acquainted with something around here, where to go and what to do.
TLM: So you met Mrs. Brown doing that?
MAC: Oh no, I met Mrs. Brown a long time before that, I forget how I met her. But she was one of the people over there and that's how I happened to go. She encouraged me and lots of other young women like myself, my friends, girls with me, to go over there to meet with the boys and be a hostess so you could make it pleasant for...
TLM: This is before you met Mrs. Brown's son?
MAC: Yes, that's right. I didn't... Well, I don't know, I think I knew him then, too, but we all did it anyway. He was just around. He hadn't been drafted. When he was drafted, they drafted, oh, I don't know how many young fellows from here. And they went off. Huntington Avenue used to be the railroad station over there where the Back Bay station is now. It came on up this way, and we went down there to see them off. They must have had fifty or sixty of them down there, carloads of them, drafted to go to war. Fifty or sixty﻿33
MAC: (cont.) fellows from our area. Then of course, fifty or sixty or a hundred from South Boston, fifty or sixty from East Boston, and just thousands of them getting on trains, oh, long trains, getting ready to go away. It was awful sad. But that is, that was when the war started—well, after it started, because they didn't get drafted in the first part, it was just occasionally they'd draft so many. And send them off.
But when he [my husband] went, I remember going down there to the railway to see them off, you know, and oh, my goodness, I'll never forget that day. When the train moved off, the people, some of them were married and had little children, and they took them anyway. And you know, it was terrible. But most of them were single, I'd say young fellows. But that's what happened. That was World War I.
There were many women—you were talking about women—a lot of women around, just ordinary mothers and people who had families that I admired, who were out trying to help all of us young people to do things. We had a lot oi~ good friends, older women, some of them. Of course, they're all dead and gone now, but there were women whom we looked up to, who were leaders in the community, just simple leaders. They weren't educated women, or professional women or doctors or lawyers. They were just simply people who lived in the community, who'd try to help you and tell you things to do, and tell you how to go about getting with the right people to stay with and not get in trouble or get in with the wrong crowd; just good neighbors, that's all. We had plenty of those. And I liked them. Plenty of women lived right in my street that I thought were good people.
TLM: Well, can you give me some names of women who were particularly...
MAC: Well, I don't know about giving you names like that now. I'd have
to think of who these different people were, but that was the custom in those days, to help young people, to try to do things better, you know. We had Sunday school teachers that were influential. And we didn't go to the Y in those days, but we did go to the Sunday school, to church with them, seeing that we were most of these young people coming up. I remember that. I got a lot of inspiration from that.
TLM: We've talked quite a bit about World War I. Can you think of other events or local events or national events or events in your personal life that had an important impact on your life as you were beginning to start a family and get settled?
MAC: I had most of my training as you know, and I knew exactly what to do in most of the cases and getting the home started or anything else; my mother-in-law used to always tell me I was a good planner. Sometimes I knew planning better than she did. And she would turn over a lot of the... When she was out to work, she didn't worry﻿34
MAC: (cont.) about the house; I'd do the cooking, and even go out and do the shopping and come back, and have everything ready when they got home. And she always felt that I was exceptional in having had the training I had in school, that helped me to know exactly what to do, and working out as I did with people and learning how to manage things, how to use your money and how to get the best out of your money. Always had an idea of that after I grew up. I was never extravagant.
TLM: And where did you learn all of that?
MAC: Well, I think I got it basically at the school. Because they taught us domestic training. How to run a home, what to buy, these consumer things—what you call consumer now, they didn't say that then—but how to buy, how to spend your money, how to use it to the best advantage, how to save your money, how to keep your home, how to manage it, all that I knew. That was part of my training; I didn't have to learn that.
So that's why when I worked out for people, they always used to say they didn't have to tell me much because I understood what it was. All I had to know was the layout of the place and I'd go in and do it. The same thing everywhere. But I knew what I had to do. They didn't have to run around me saying, "Do this now, do that now." If they tell you they want this done, you go right ahead and do it. I always had that kind of ability to do, and so I always could, as I say, always get work to do. I'd work for somebody and leave them. They'd be calling me up, asking me would I come back and would I do this and would I do that. So this showed you did know what you were doing. And that you were dependable and they could feel they had somebody who knew what they were doing. And that means a great deal.
But as for the people throughout my life that I met as I went along, most of them were black women who've died now, who lived just like I'm living now. I look back on it, and they were out doing things wherever they could and helping where they could and raising their family and all that, just ordinary people. I didn't have any big people that I thought were so great like they do now. They think of big women in history like Mary McLeod Bethune and all those kind of people. I didn't really need to know too much about them because I had just good neighbors. People who were willing to help you anyway. Even when I lived down on Sussex Street, there were people around there that I became friendly with, and if you wanted to go and do an errand you could leave your children with them until you came back. Just neighbors. And in the summer...
TLM: I wish you could think of some of the names.
MAC: Well, one or two who were so good to me were in the families that lived right near me there, who I... Right across the street from me was Rosa Hathaway, her name was. She never married. She was﻿35
MAC: (cont.) kind of, we called an old maid. Now whenever I wanted to
go anyplace, she'd always take ray children in; it was just like home for them. If I wanted to go shopping or go somewhere and stay two or three hours, I didn't have to worry about my children. They were just like at home, and they wanted to go over there. They loved her just like she was a relative; they didn't know the difference. They called her Rosa, but they loved her because she was so good to them, both her and her mother. They lived there, just those two.
TLM: On Sussex Street.
MAC: Yes, right across the street from me. Rosa Hathaway, she was what... we'd call her an old maid lady, as she never married. She's about my age, really. But we were good friends, and she became really almost like a relative, she was so close to my children. She was a person who would always keep my children if I was going to run someplace or do an errand, go uptown and didn't want to take them... And even if I wanted to go away someplace, even for two or three days or anything, she'd keep them and they were right at home in her house. They were just over there any time they felt like it. She was that kind of a person. And there were other neighbors around me who were similar. We had another lady, whole family of people, young people, wonderful people, lived across the street, the Lovetts. There were three sisters, they were wonderful people. In that street.
And of course about that time, while I was living there, I became very much interested in community work. And there was a good many people in that community center that really helped me in a lot of ways, and my children. We lived right on Sussex Street, as I told you. And Hammond Street was where the community center was, the Robert Gould Shaw House. And that is where I, as a young woman, went to take my children, of course, my boy, to what we called a preschool kindergarten. And they asked all the mothers, when it started, to help because they didn't have much money. We used to volunteer and take our children and take different turns to go down, until they got money from something like the United Fund or some funding thing like that to really have it go permanently. And that, right there in that community center, I met all the friends mostly that I have today, whose children were growing up with my children.
TLM: Well, would you name some of your friends?
MAC: Oh, yes. There's loads of them. There's the Byars family, B-Y-A-R-S, the Byars family; the Guscott family, the Dawsons, the Jordans, the Stokeses, the Lamberts, the Eliots... Oh my goodness, I could go on with plenty of those that were right in there together with their children at that time. One of my dearest friends I had all of my life, in fact she went to school with me as a little girl, we helped﻿36
MAC: (cont.) a great deal there, Wheeler, Alice Wheeler. She died a few ...about two years ago.
TLM: What school did you go to together?
MAC: We went to the first school there in Boston where I went, I was a little girl...the Prince. We started out there.
TLM: You and Alice Wheeler were in school together?
MAC: That's right,little girls. They lived in Kendall Street, too, when I did, and we've been friends all those years. That's one of my dearest friends. She just passed away. Her children were born right along the same time as mine and came right up together, you know. She lived right down here, moved out here like I did.
TLM: Oh, what street?
MAC: Right in Munroe, down here. Right here at Harry's shop where you go through. She lived right there on Humboldt Avenue; she didn't buy a house like I did, so she rented. But she had three children. She lost one little boy down on Hammond Street.
But all of us worked at the Robert Gould Shaw House together. It was a community center where we all came together and met each other, and our children grew up together in that neighborhood, you see.
TLM: Was this during the 1920s?
MAC: Well, I don't know what it was; it was right after the war, all the time I lived there; my little boy was old enough to go to kindergarten there. He went, the children, all of them went there.
TLM: And your girls were just babies?
MAC: Only one didn't go there, the last one. She didn't...Melanie didn't get a chance to go much at the... But she went to the camp. We have a camp attached to it called Breezy Meadows up in Holliston, and all of them went up to the camp. They went to that camp during the summer and we had a club there and we had...
TLM: At the Shaw House?
MAC: Yes, we had a club of the mothers of this kindergarten program.
TLM: Did the club have a name?
MAC: Yes, it was a Friendship Club. The Kindergarten Mothers first, because we were the kindergarten mothers. Then as that house developed to the community, and it became stronger and stronger,﻿37
MAC: (cont.) they realized the need for a nursery school So they built a new building around the corner. It was an annex to Shaw House, and they put in it a nursery school facility. And it really had one of the first nursery schools in the black communities, established right there, from some of us who helped with it. And after we had the nursery school—then by that time, the mothers whose children were going to the nursery school were younger than we were— and we said, well, we wouldn't take a formal step in the nursery school, we'll change our name to the Friendship Club. And we became the Friendship Club and we still are.
TLM: And did you stay at the Shaw House?
MAC: Oh, we were a part of the Shaw House. We became the Friendship
Club of the Robert Gould Shaw House; we were founded right there. All we did was change our name from Kindergarten Mothers to Friendship. And we had i membership, probably s ixty-rive or seventy-five mothers who lived in that community. And we did all kind of community work for the settlement house, such as raising money, such as giving dinners, and giving little parties for the children, helping with the children's camp money and raising money for all kinds of things down there. And we worked for the Community Fund, that's what it was then; went through the streets with little cups and into the houses, getting money for the Community Fund. Because they were helping us with our funding there, so we felt we were obligated to work for it. Every year we worked on that drive, and we, at that time, did door-to-door canvassing; didn't have what they have now, the Community Fund hadn't got sophisticated, you know, like it is now. It's high class now, just write your check and that. But we didn't have any checks, so we got IOC, 25C, 50c from the mothers, and bring our little cups in and turn them in proudly. We took different sections of the neighborhood. We branched out.
TLM: Tell me something about the neighborhood. You mentioned the black community. Was that neighborhood sort of a central neighborhood in the black community, was there an identifiable black community?
MAC: No, that was it. That's where black people lived, in the South End of Boston, right around in there. That probably is what they would have called years ago a "ghetto;" we knew nothing about a ghetto, never heard of such a thing. That was our neighborhood, where we lived. And there was black and white people living there. It wasn't solidly black for quite a number of years. We had Italians living there, they went to school with us, and all around there, my gracious, it was really something to think about. They did business at stores; we communicated together; we didn't have all this racial prejudice you got now. So we just had to get to that, it was terrible.﻿38
TLM: Well, how about at the Shaw House? Were various ethnic groups and racial groups at the Shaw House?
MAC: Yes, there were some. A few came there too. We had a few white
people belonged there, and we mingled in together very nicely, but it was predominantly for colored people, because it was a neighborhood mostly of us colored people, and the settlement house, naturally, was mostly colored. It had everything there for the kids after school; they had all kinds of athletics and sports and everything for them; they had classes there for sewing, for cooking, teaching them all kinds of things; they had even chair caning. In those days it was proper to cane your chairs, you know, so the boys used to have chair caning, and they learned carpentry work. They had a little of everything in that building for the kids in the community, and they went there after school and went there on Saturdays, and they just had great times. They had choral groups for the young ones and choral groups for the older ones, and the adults. They had a Mothers' Club, a Fathers' Club, and a basketball team and baseball. And they'd go to other places to play because they didn't have a gym at first. And they would go over on the playground with them, around Columbus Avenue, with the baseball, those young kids. They had just wonderful groups that came out of there. All kind of everything.
TLM: So your family participated at the Shaw House and you were also a member of the Women's Service Club?
MAC: Oh, yeah, I joined the Women's Service Club quite a few years after I was grown and was doing quite a lot of community work. That's later in my life.
TLM: But Mrs. Brown was a member?
MAC: Mrs. Brown was one of the founders of it.
TLM: Well, did you participate in the NAACP at that time?
MAC: Yes, I would work with it on the drive to get members.
TLM; Even when your kids were small?
MAC: Oh yes. To get members, I'd attend the meetings when I wanted to. I didn't become as active with it when the children were small as when they got older. I had more time, and I could participate, and I finally became president of the Boston branch of the NAACP, and naturally very involved in it.
TLM: In what other groups... You were at Saint Mark's at that time too, when your kids were small?﻿39
MA.C: No, my children were a good size when we moved out here, and I
joined it after I moved here. I've only been over in that church forty-seven years, just as long as I've been in this house.
TLM: I see. So when you were in the South End, did you belong to a church at that time?
MAC: No special church. I didn't belong to any. Twelfth Baptist was very near me, and my children used to go there to Sunday school. That was on Shawmut Avenue and my street ran right into it, so they could go there easily. I'd go there occasionally.
TLM: What schools did your kids begin to go to?
MAC: Down in the South End? Oh, they went to the Hyde, the Sherwin and ...let's see, I guess the Hyde and the Sherwin were the principal schools they went to. The boy went to the Sherwin and the girls
went to the Hyde; that was on Hammond Street. T went there too, you know, when I was a child.
TLM: Oh, first you went to the Prince and then over to the Hyde?
MAC: Then went over there, yes, when we moved into the South End; went to those schools that were there. I finished grammar school in Newburyport. I told you that.
TLM: Well, and at this time you were beginning to do a little community work and you were a member of the Friendship Club at the Robert Gould Shaw House in the South End.
MAC: That's where I started to do community work. Didn't know anything about it until I started there.
TLM: At this time you weren't working?
MAC: Oh no... I was telling you about my husband. When my husband
went off to the service, he was working for a man who had a laboratory, a mechanical dental laboratory, on Boylston Street, and he used to do the driving and pick up the packages and do different kinds of work like that. When he came back from the service, of course, he went back down there to see if he could get a job there, and he told him, oh yes, he could come right in there and get a job, and he'd find a job for him. So he did and he went in doing those chores around and began driving him again and doing different things. So one day he was talking to him. He said, "I think you should go in the laboratory and learn the business, the trade. Because you have a family and you can do it, because you're perfectly capable of learning it, and I would like for you to go in the laboratory." So my husband said he'd just love to go in the laboratory. He used to stand around and watch them pack teeth and﻿40
MAC: (cont.) do different things. He was very interested in it, but they'd never ask him to work there, and he didn't ask for a job there. There never was a colored fellow in there, and he thought probably they wouldn't hire him. The owner went in to see the foreman, and he told him he wanted him to take my husband Marshall on, to learn the business. He wanted him to learn the trade. So he [the owner] said the foreman looked at him funny. He told Marshall about it he said, "He [the foreman] looked at me funny but he didn't say a word, because had he said anything, Marshall, I'd let him go, because I want you to learn it. You've got to make a living for your family.1' I had met him and his wife, and they were very nice people. So my husband went into the laboratory, and he learned the whole trade and became one of the leading people there. He worked there until this gentleman went into bankruptcy. He stayed right there. I don't remember the year, but it was during the depression when everybody went into bankruptcies.
TLM: What specifically did Marshall? What was his work?
MAC: Well, he did the dental laboratory work- He was a fine tradesman
with it. He packed teeth and did everything they did in there that they were supposed to do. So he became a dental laboratory technician before he finished. That was his title.
TLM: So he did this during the twenties and up until the thirties, sometime.
MAC: Yes, up until the depression. And he made a wonderful salary. That's how we were able to save money to buy this house. Of course, you know, having a family, three children, he must have made a good enough salary, because we put money away into the Co-operative Bank, took shares out so we could buy a house some day, and we bought it. So he got his start right there, in that laboratory. So when that depression came and he went into bankruptcy, my husband had to look around for some other kind of job. He was a veteran, you know, and he had his veterans'rights, so he went around to see what he could get in the government. He went over to work at the Watertown Arsenal. And he worked on the machines and all kinds of things there, and he made a good salary there, of course, excellent.
I didn't have to work if I didn't want to, didn't need to work. He didn't really want me to work anyway. I never worked, never worked while I was married. If I wanted to work, once in a while I did. I never had to work to help support the family because he always made a good salary, enough, even when we were on Sussex Street, you see, when he was in the laboratory, driving for this fellow. I can't think of his name. He paid him a good salary. He got the average salary that most men got, and more than average. He wanted to save. He wanted to make a headway to pay for kids to go to college and everything else. So he didn't want me to go out to work when they were little, by any means. He used to see the women﻿41
MAC: (cont.) going by, friends of mine, with their children early in the morning, taking them somewhere, so they could go somewhere to work, and he'd be going to work and he'd say, "I hope you never have to do that." And he said, "While I'm living, you won't be able to do that. I wouldn't have it. Don't take my children anywhere. I want you to take care of them yourself." He was very definite about that Take care of the children. So I always took care of my family, and cooked and sewed, and did all kinds of things in the house. I would do everything. Made all their clothes, and everything.
TLM: Oh, you sewed?
MAC: Oh, I made all my children's clothes when they were little, saved
lots of money. And of course, you could save a lot of money because you could get a little piece of material and make a dress. For what you'd have to go to buy a dress, you wouldn't be able to buy but one dress, while I could make two or three for the same money.
TLM: Now, what was Mr. Cass's job category at the arsenal?
MAC: He was an oiler on machines. I think it was called oiler, I'm not sure. He did two or three different things out at the Watertown Arsenal. I forget. So when he left there, he applied for a job and he became a part of the G.S.A., General Services Administration, the government agency that takes care of the supplies and services. He became a guard down at the Federal Building. That's where he was working when he died.
TLM: And when did he move from the arsenal to that job?
MAC: Well, I don't know, soon after the war had ceased. It was wartime work, you know, at the arsenal.
TLM: After World War II?
MAC: Yes,so it was a leftover, World War II... The arsenal went. They closed it. Whenever they closed the arsenal, that's when he began to look for a job.
TLM: And where was his new job?
MAC: Down in the Federal Building, right down where the government
federal building is sitting, right there [John McCormack Building].
TLM:	Downtown?
MAC:	The Federal Building. He was a guard there...
TLM:	It was Cambridge Street?
MAC:	No, it was the one right there down in where the court is.﻿42
TLM: Milk Street?
MAC: Milk Street. He worked there till he passed. He was a guard. You could go right in... He was on the first floor.
TLM: Tell me, while your children were growing up, what was a typical day like? What time did you wake up in the morning and what sorts of things did you do during the day?
MAC: Well, I always got up early to get the children out to school, and
to fix my husband's lunch—he always took a lunch—fix my children's lunch. I got up half past six or seven o'clock, started right in, and then I'd be going all day with my work.
TLM: What sorts of things did you do during the day?
MAC: You mean, the housework? Everything, clean up your house, wash,
iron, cook, sew, do whatever there was in here to do. Nobody to do it but me. Had to keep the house clean, had to wash and iron. For years I didn't have any washing machine, so I had to wash on the board and hang them up, take them in, iron them. We ironed the clothes in those days. My children wore starched dresses and all that, you know, to school. They had to have clean things every day, underwear and all that, so I had to wash and iron and cook and sew and mend.
TLM: Did you do your laundry in the kitchen?
MAC: Yes, right in the kitchen. I had a sink and a board to scrub on.
I have it now, one of those old washboards. You all don't know what they are, but that's what we had before you had the washing machine. You had to have money to get a washing machine. So finally we saved up and got a washing machine. I never had a dryer. So I used to hang them out on the pulley line here in back, on my porch, dry them and take them in, iron them and put them away. I had to do all that, sheets and everything I had. So I had plenty of work to do in the house. With the children, you had to cook. I cooked all the time, made bread and made rolls, pies, et cetera.
TLM: When you were down on Sussex Street, where did you do your shopping?
MAC: Well, Washington Street mostly was our shopping district. Just put
the baby in the baby carriage, and go right up there, and we used to go from here to Washington Street, down around the same stores that are there. Blair's and Timothy Smith's used to be there, Houghton and Dutton. All the stores around, that's where we shopped. That was the shopping center.
TLM: Your groceries? Around that area too?﻿43
MAC: Uh huh. Got all the groceries and brought them back, and then my husband used to go to the big market downtown, Faneuil Hall, to get meat and fish and all those kind of things. And when my little boy was good-sized and getting big, he went with him. Take him shopping with him.
TLM: How often?
MAC: Every week. He went down and he'd get his meat and fish and
vegetables, fruit, et cetera. Then I got all the groceries right at the store here.
TLM: Was there a shopping day? Did you have a shopping day?
MAC: Sometimes Friday I would go. Just like now. And sometimes Saturday.
TLM: You usually shop on Friday?
MAC: I do mostly. My daughter does the shopping now, but she shops the
end of the week, Thursday or Friday. But I always used to go Friday morning, you know, while they were in school. Just go on, get my shopping, and come back.
TLM: And when would your husband go to Faneuil Hall?
MAC: On Saturdays. That was a big market day. Everybody used to go down to Faneuil Hall market, they called it; Quincy Market now; just made it over. And the carts and everything would be out, vegetables and fish and all kind of things. You got things cheaper there. And he'd do all the marketing practically for the whole week. Just meats and vegetables and things like that that you wanted to get. That's the way we planned. He used to love to go. He liked it.
TLM: And then you'd just bring the food home and store it right here?
MAC: In an icebox. We had an icebox them. I didn't have any Frigidaire, early days. I had an icebox with a pan underneath it, and catching the water, and watching to empty it so it wouldn't get on the lady's ceiling downstairs. So we had to watch for the iceman.
TLM: Oh, and he'd make rounds?
MAC: Oh yes, they'd put a card in the window when you wanted your ice and he would deliver it.
TLM: A card? What did it say?
MAC: Just, "ice." And he knew what you wanted. You had one iceman. You had your own particular dealer you traded with. When he saw your card in the window, he brought your ice up.﻿44
TLM: Like the oil man?
MAC: Just exactly the same way. Only with the oil man, you don't have
to do it, he comes automatically to fill it. But you would have to have your card in the window to tell him if you need it, because he didn't know how fast it was melting or what you'd want. But he'd come up with the big tongs and all, and put it right in your ice chest for you.
TLM: Did your family have a car?
MAC: No, we never had a car. Never. No, my daughters, after they got married...as this generation, they all have cars. But we used to walk. I'd get on the bus and take the children everywhere we wanted to go.
TLM: So when you went to shop you took the bus?
MAC: Just took the streetcar down to Dudley Street. You'd get there before you could turn around and come back.
TLM: What station, to get down to Dudley, where...
MAC: I'd just go out to the corner, near Harrishof Street and catch the
bus. Passing there all the time. You'd stand there and get the bus. That same bus was there when I came and has been there ever since.
TLM: How did you find this beautiful house?
MAC: We didn't have any trouble finding it, because we had some friends out here, who lived here, looking around for us.
TLM: Who?
MAC: The same friend that died, and other friends that live all around
here, some of them are dead and gone. They had moved out here, and they"d tell you when there was a house for sale.
TLM: What friend was that? That wasn't Alice Wheeler?
MAC: Yes, she was one. Because she always wanted to move. She moved
out here before me. She always used to say, "You ought to do this, you ought to do that." I said, "Well, I am, some day." So you see, it was a migration of the people from the South End out here. That was a general thing then. And they were moving from down there, out here. Because these were better houses, and they were supposed to be better schools. It was supposed to be a better area. The Jews were moving out and the black people were moving in. That's the way that was.
TLM: Well, did you buy your house from a Jewish family?﻿45
MAC: Yes, all Jews owned all of these houses out here. There were very few Irish left. It was first Irish, then Jewish.
TLM: Well, was the Cass family the first black family in this part of Harold Street?
MAC: No, there were two or three here when I moved. There was a lady on the corner, a Mrs. Jackson and there was another one on the other corner, the Weekses, and I think there was one next door.
TLM: Did the Jacksons and the Weekses stay here for a long time too?
MAC: Oh yes, they stayed here for years.
TLM: Do those families still live here?
MAC: There was another family left, I can't think of their names. They
were here too, owned that house. These people bought them in this block.
TLM: You mean the whole building. Are all the houses on this block similar to this one?
MAC: Yes, very much. They are "three families," and each [apartment] has at least six rooms. I have seven. This one has seven. The one on the corner has seven. Tn between, they're all six and five.
TLM: Did your family move into this apartment and rent out the other apartments?
MAC: Yes, rent out the other two. My daughter' s been here now twenty-five years on the first floor, and the lady on the second floor has been here for twenty-five or thirty years, so we've all been here together.
TLM: When you moved to Harold Street, how old were your children and what schools were they attending?
MAC: Well, they all went to schools right out here, the Lewis Middle School.
TLM: Is that like junior high school?
MAC: That was junior... Before that, they went to elementary school, the Henry Lee Higginson School. The Higginson and then the other one right back here, Ellis School, were elementary schools. They went to Memorial High. My youngest girl went to Latin School and my boy went to Memorial High School. They all graduated from there.
TLM: What high school did your son go to?﻿46
MAC: Right over here. Roxbury Memorial High School. My daughter graduated from there, Marianne. And Melanie went to Latin, then she came over and graduated from Memorial High, the last two years she left Latin. So they all graduated from Memorial High, [which had a girls' side and a boys' side.]
TLM: Melanie didn't like it at Latin?
MAC: Well, she didn't think she was getting her proper marks. She's very smart, and she was disillusioned. So I thought she'd better get out so she could be happy wherever she was. So they all graduated from there. Then Melanie, of course, is the only one who went to college. She went to Fisk University first, and graduated, and then came back to Boston and got her master's degree at B.U. [Boston University] in social work.
TLM: And what did Marshall do after high school?
MAC: Marshall went into World War II, you know. He graduated from high school. And he didn't go any further, until he came out of the war. And he went to business school. And he is now in real estate business and insurance.
TLM: Where did he go to business school?
MAC: In New York. Took it at night. I forget what he told me, but he went at night while he was working. He's lived in New York ever since he got married, right after World War II. Hasn't been home, only to visit us, that's all.
TLM: What was the maiden name of Marshall's wife?
MAC: I can't think. What was the girl's name? I can't think of what it is now, because he got a divorce from her. I can't think what her name was.
TLM: He's been divorced for quite a while?
MAC: Yes, he's been divorced. He's not married any more. I can't think of what her name is right now, it might come to me pretty soon.
TLM: Okay. And Marianne, what did she do after high school?
MAC: Well, Marianne went to business school over here, to the technical,
to the, you know, school for business. What's the name of the school? It was right here on Warren Street. Took a few courses in secretarial work and so forth. So she did that for a while, just...not too long, but she did do it for, I'd say, about three years or so, I guess. And then she got tired of that and decided she didn't want to do it. So during the war, when they were hiring for the shipyards, she worked in one of them. She did a lot of work there.﻿47
TLM: Do you remember which shipyard?
MAC: Well, I think the one right out here in Charlestown. They hired a lot of women. She thought she'd like it. She did. She went there until after the war was over. Of course, she was married, too. She got married and so, of course, that ended, you know what I mean.
TLM: So she worked for a while and then got married?
MAC: That's right. No particular work after that. She did little jobs whenever she wanted to.
TLM: And is that when she took the apartment next to you?
MAC: Oh no, she'd been married a long time before she moved out here.
She was, let's see, oh, I guess she must have been married... she's been here about twenty-five years, twenty anyway. And she's been
married, oh, I guess she's been married thirty-some years. I know she is, because the oldest boy is twenty-nine or thirty. So she lived down in the housing development project before she came here.
TLM: On what street?
MAC: On Kendall Street. She didn't have any children, and had been married about seven or eight years before any children were born. When she had the baby, it wasn't enough room; we thought she ought to come out of there so she'd be more comfortable. The apartment was going to be empty, so she came and moved in here. She's been here ever since.
TLM: And what work does her husband do?
MAC: He works for the Christian Science Publishing Company in their
engineering department. He had his job there before he went into the service, and came right back and worked right again. He's been working for them, I forget how many years. Most of his working years. He's in the engineering department, which takes care of machines and all that sort of thing, I guess. He isn't a machinist; I don't know what they call them.
TLM: And does Marianne work?
MAC: Yes, oh yes. Marianne works. She's working for the Charles R. Drew Health Center. She's a billing clerk- She is very pleased with it. She's been there ever since it opened, so that's about three years, I guess, now, of that. Before that, she didn't work. She stayed home mostly with her children too.
TLM: How many kids does Marianne have?
MAC: Three, and four grandchildren.﻿48
TLM:	And you say her oldest is about thirty? Twenty-nine, thirty?
MAC:	He must be about thirty.
TLM:	What's his name?
MAC:	Roger.
TLM:	And what is Marianne's husband's name? Her husband's full name?
MAC:	George Freeman.
TLM:	And her son's name?
MAC:	Roger.
TLM:	Roger. And then...
MAC:	The next girl's name is Melanie. She's named after her aunt. And the youngest one's name is Kimberly.
TLM: So three kids. And how old are Melanie and Kimberly?
MAC: Well, I guess... I don't know their ages exactly, but they come
right along close together too. Roger and Melanie are close together but Melanie and Kim are about six or seven years apart. So you have to figure out their ages, I don't ever get it straight. But Marianne had the first two children and then it was about six or seven years before she had Kim. She has got four grandchildren.
TLM: Whose children are they?
MAC: Roger has one.
TLM: What's Roger's wife's name?
MAC: Roger's wife's name is Nancy.
TLM: Do you know what her maiden name is?
MAC: No, I don't.
TLM: So they have one child. A boy or a girl?
MAC: A little boy.
TLM: About how old?
MAC: Well, he's about nineteen months, I guess. Something like that. And then Sister—we call her Sister, but her name is Melanie—the next girl, she has two. One is five and one is about three and a half or four.﻿49
TLM: And what's her husband's name?
MAC: Her husband's name is Albert McNair. She's a McNair.
TLM: And then the youngest?
MAC: Kimberly. She has one. [She's a single parent.] She's working.
Yes, she works in the government job in the Federal Building too, I think, doing some sort of secretarial work.
TLM: And, so all of Marianne's children went through high school?
MAC: Oh yes.
TLM: And got married and took jobs?
MAC: Yes, they didn't go to college, but they all went to high school.
All graduated from high school.
TLM: How about Melanie?
MAC: Which one?
TLM: Your daughter Melanie.
MAC: Well, my daughter Melanie, of course, is married. She didn't have any children.
TLM: Where does she live?
MAC: Right over here on Supple Road, not far from me. Right here. She
worked for some years with the Boston Public Welfare, and from there she went to Massachusetts General [Hospital] and worked in the orthopedic department. She went to school from the Public Welfare Department for her degree. And then when she finished she had her placement in...she got her job after her master's degree, in the orthopedic department of Massachusetts General Hospital. She worked there a long time. I don't remember how many years. And then she worked for ABCD [Action for Boston Community Development] to help them organize a multiservice center out here in Roxbury.
TLM: Which one?
MAC: Right out here. The multiservice center we have out here...community center.
TLM: Roxbury Multi-Service Center?
MAC: Yes. She helped to get the plans developed.
TLM: What is Melanie's married name?﻿50
MAC: Melanie Houchins. Kind of an odd name. Her husband works for HUD [Department of Housing and Urban Development]. I don't know what his title is, but it's sort of like a regional planner.
TLM: What's his full name?
MAC: His name is Joseph. I don't know what his middle name is. Melanie, at the present time, isn't working at all. She's just taken a leave of absence from work. She hasn't been so well. She hasn't worked for about a year. But temporarily she helped the Y lately with a program for training women in the untraditional training jobs. She took a job with them to help plan that program, too. And to get it started, and worked as a developer of that. That was just temporary. She just did it to help out.
TLM: Well, you told me about your children and... You told me about how you moved to this house on Harold Street in about 1930. Do you
remember the depression at all and what was that like?
MAC: Oh yes, I remember the depression. That was a terrible siege of distress to most people.
TLM: How did that affect your life?
MAC: Well, it affected me a great deal, because that was during the time, I think, that my husband worked at the arsenal and it closed. He was out of work for quite a while, going around trying to get a job from the government agencies, and so forth and so on, and that was a critical time in our lives here, because we were buying this house, and my mother-in-law was living here with us, and of course she couldn't work or anything. We wouldn't want her to work, you know. So that was one period in my life when I really went to work myself, to help, so we wouldn't have to lose the house, and so we could live better. I worked for a family in Newton.
TLM: Oh, you did? Do you remember their names?
MAC: The Arnolds. I went up there, really not to stay as long as I did, but a very dear friend who worked for them, and her husband, used to come here to visit us, and...Martha Bland used to come visit me when she had her day off, and she was saying things were so bad. I said to her, "I think I'll have to get a job and work some place." So she said, "Well, you know, out where I am, they want someone to come and help out. And if you want it, I'll speak about it." ^So I said, "Sure, go ahead." So I told my husband and he said, "Oh, I don t think you should do that." I said, "Well, I think I should, because it will help, you know, to keep the worry off of you, and so that we won't lose our house." People were losing their houses; they were foreclosing mortgages and everything. So I went out to work for about three or four weeks. I was supposed to work for them, "accommodate," they called it. And I stayed three years.﻿51
TLM: What does that mean?
MAC: Well, fill in. Fill in while they didn't have anybody else, as an accommodation. They were looking for someone to take care of the children—they had two little boys—and to do the upstairs work, and to really be partial nurse for the children. Of course I liked that. They were looking for someone. I told them I would only do it temporarily till they got somebody. So I stayed there, and they didn't get anybody, and they kept on not getting anybody, and I kept on... My husband wasn't working anyway. So she said to me one day, "Why don't you just stay until your husband gets a job?" She said, "We'd like to have you stay." So I talked it over at home, and my mother-in-law said, "I'm here. I can take care of the house and the children. If you want to do it, just go ahead and do it." So I did. I stayed out there almost three years.
TLM: Oh, do you remember what years those were?
MAC: No, I don't quite remember.
TLM: Sometime during the depression?
MAC: Oh yes, it was during the depression.
TLM: And your kids, were your kids teenagers yet?
MAC: Oh, they were big, yes. They were big. So that's one reason I didn't want to, and burden my mother-in-law with them. She was growing older, you know, but she was very active. She went everywhere she wanted. She was active almost up until she died; she was ninety when she died.
TLM: What year did she die?
MAC: I forget. I got it all written down here somewhere.
TLM: Just a general idea? Was it in the forties or fifties?
MAC: Oh, well, she's been dead about twenty-five years. That must be...
So I worked for this family for almost three years, I guess, before he really got work with the government. And when he got the job with the government, guard with the General Services Administration...the Federal Building. Then he said, "I think you may as well come home, because I know this is a job I'll have the rest of my life. There's no need staying out there." So I told them I would have to come home. Of course, they expected that sometime. Because I had told them I would stay there until my husband got a job.
TLM: When you were working in Newton, what were your hours like?﻿52
MAC: Oh, I stayed there. I didn't come home at all. Only one day off a week, and Sundays, or something like that. But I stayed there right straight along... I'd come home any night I wanted, to visit the kids or do what I want. They used to come out there to visit me, too, sometime. On Saturday or something like that, you know.
TLM: How often did you come in? Did you come in once a week and...
MAC: Oh yes, you always had your day off in those domestic works. You had one day off a week. And then you had Sundays. Every other Sunday, maybe. Because one group would work one Sunday, and the next Sunday would be your Sunday to go home right after lunch, or something, and stay until the next day.
TLM: I see. And did you take, was there a subway car?
MAC: Oh no, that's a long ways out. I seldom had	to go on the subway. I
had a very dear friend who had a car, and he	used to come every time and get me. Bring me home.
TLM: Who was this?
MAC: A friend of ours, a Mr. Washington. A dear friend of the family. And he always used to come get me and bring me back. He was very, very faithful like that. Because he knew I had never been away like that. A dear friend of my family, just almost like part of the family. So he would come out there and get me and bring me back. And if not, why, I'd go part of the way on the trolley and then take a cab the rest of the way home, something like that, to break the cost.
TLM: What was your salary like?
MAC: Oh, I was making I think around eighteen or twenty-one dollars a week, on that order. That was pretty good wages in those days. And I was able to help a lot here, you see, keep things going.
TLM: You had a mortgage on the house?
MAC: We didn't have to worry about it. So we did very well, but we had
our difficulties, because we had people move in who wouldn't pay you; you had to wait...
TLM: Oh, that's right, you had tenants.
MAC: It was very bad until my daughter came, and Mrs. Johnson downstairs came, and she's been here now twenty-five or thirty years, so it makes a difference. Much easier to run it this way.
TLM: With someone who's here...﻿53
MAC: Permanently and steady, and they pay the money regularly, and it
makes a lot of difference when you have a mortgage to pay on. It's practically all paid for now, but I had to remortgage it not long ago to fix up a little. It was all paid for before that.
TLM: Well, you've told me about your working with the family in Newton, and I'm just wondering something about that job. How do you think being black and female affected the options that you had available to you?
MAC: Well, in those days, of course, being black, dear, affected every black person getting any kind of job. Of course, you could get domestic work, because they always felt that black people should do domestic work. That was no big problem, to get domestic work. But it was getting other kinds of jobs where the discrimination came in. You couldn't work in the stores or the banks. There are a lot of places where you see l:hesa nt>w, you didn't work in my time, my working days. We were working for those things for them, trying to open the way that they could get there. That's one of the things we did. And that's the civil rights movement. That's what it was. Fair employment practices and all those kinds of things, some of us had to work on in order to get jobs for our people.
TLM: Well, were you working on that as far back as then?
MAC: Oh yes, I've worked on all those things, and when it first started,
FEPC [Fair Employment Practices Commission]. And all that was during the war when the government had to declare the Fair Employment Practices Act, because even the government, even these government, municipal, these plants...and war plants weren't even hiring the black people like they should. Even the men and the women, so we had to get that straightened out. So that's how my daughter happened to go in. She went in anyway. Because, she said, as long as they have jobs for women, I may as well take one. And it was just that sort of feeling among the young people that wanted to make the money. They paid more money there than they did anywhere else. So they were glad to get in there. Of course older women like didn't do it, but my daughter did.
I couldn't get a job when I came out of school, I told you, in any of the stores or any place else- The only resort for most black people was domestic work. A few got jobs otherwise, but it wasn't that you was a woman at that time that bothered, because women could get all the work they wanted, domestic work. They were open, they could get it any time. You always could make a living. But it wasn't always what you wanted to do. But you had to do it. I didn't want to do it, because I felt I could have done something else. I could have gone in as a trainee in some of these offices, receptionist, and all these things that I see people doing now, I could have easily done it in my young days. But they wouldn't hire﻿54
MAC: (cont.) me, because I was a colored woman, a black woman, or
whatever you call It. We were "colored." So, but the thing that they didn't look to see if you were a woman for that, there was no competition for black people. They always could get plenty domestic work to do. No, they could always get it. That's how they educated their families and did everything else, doing domestic work.
TLM: What about being black versus being a woman? The two different kinds of discrimination?
MAC: Well, we didn't have that, dear, in my day. They didn't discriminate against you because you were a woman.
TLM: I guess what I'm wondering about is, you were more aware of any kind of discrimination that had to do with race...
MAC: Oh yes, you couldn't get a job... You would get the job just
because you were black, and some black men couldn't get jobs either in certain places. So it wasn't an idea of female or male in our cases. It was mostly black against white. They hired white people, and they didn't hire you for certain jobs. Black men and black women, it was the same for both. It didn't make any difference. Now, of course, a good many black people took civil service examinations, knowing that they could feel they would be secure in their job. My husband had to take a civil service examination for the job he got.
TLM: The job as a guard?
MAC: Oh yes, in the administration, that he got... Well, then I knew
young women who took them, girls who took them early, but they seldom got the call, because they'd have three or four names on the list when you got there, and they'd take the one they'd want. And they would always leave the black one out. They even had to fight against that, the NAACP and all the equal rights organizations had to fight those things, and that's how these doors were opened for this generation that's here now.
TLM: When were those fights going on?
MAC: They went on just all the time, dear, that x^as going on all the time. There was no special year. We always had people working on these evils. They even had it before I even started doing it, that was what Monroe Trotter was doing. That is what the NAACP was doing seventy years ago, doing that, they've been doing that for years.
TLM: So there was no beginning to that?
MAC: No, they knew that existed, and they have been fighting it ever since they knew about it. Only it got stronger and stronger and stronger. Till the time that Martin Luther King came along, and﻿55
MAC: (cont.) all these civil rights groups, they all joined in with what was already being done. It wasn't brand new. They'd been beating at the doors for many years and couldn't get in. Yes, I took part in the forming of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters under A. Philip Randolph; he came here to Boston to change that situation.
TLM: Oh, tell me about that.
MAC: He came here to Boston, and he tried to get the Pullman porters... Which was a job for black men on the railroads. That's all they could be, Pullman porters and cooks, and carrying the bags, redcaps.
TLM: When was this?
MAC: I don't remember the year.
TLM: Didn't Mr. Brown work on the railroad?
MAC: Well, he was a porter but this was after his day, really. When
they started organizing, he was dead and gone. But when they started to organize here in Boston, they had meetings in the churches. I used to go to them, and all of us who were interested in civil rights. We would sit down and listen to what he had to say, and tell the men that they need to get a union and organize, so they can get decent pay and some better jobs on the road.
TLM: Did you go with friends?
MAC: Oh yes, we'd go just like it was any meeting. If it was a meeting tonight, dear, and you're going to have a meeting and it was advertised, people would go.
TLM: Well, which friends did you go with?
MAC: Different ones, I can't tell you now. Even	this friend that's dead.
We used to go together. The lady next door	here, all around,
anywhere we could get them to go, we'd go.	And the clubs would be
notified, and they'd send ten or fifteen or	twenty people. We'd
get it in the newspaper, The Guardian; we'd	read it's going to be and we'd just go. And you don't need anybody special to go with; you'd just go and sit down and listen.
TLM: No, I'm just wondering who your chums were who went to meetings...
MAC: Well, I had plenty of those. You never know who wants to go to
anything. Like now, I have plenty of friends, but I don't know what they want to go to. They may not say, like you would say, "I don't think I'm interested in that." So they don't go. So somebody else will go.﻿56
TLM: So you didn't have a group who went together?
MAC: No, some other lady would say, "I think I'll go; we'll get together." "I'll meet you at Dudley Street." Or we'd do this and that. "See you down there." "I'm going, I'll see you there." Like that. We didn't have to get anybody special. But we had those meetings to try to let the people know.
So Philip Randolph came here, and he started out in the churches, having meetings there to tell the Pullman porters and these people to come, and he'd try to get them organized, go to the officials and tell them how poorly they got paid. And these redcaps who were carrying the bags, transport workers, they called them, carrying people's bags and getting ten cents and a quarter. All that business, when they'd load them down with their golf bags and everything, their suitcases, et cetera, carrying them onto the trains. Because planes weren't going very much then, you know. They had to get on the trains. So these fellows used to go down, especially young fellows like my son, and all his age bracket, in the summer to carry bags in the station so they could go to college. Help them to go to school. And they wouldn't make much money sometimes, because they'd give them so little. So he [Randolph] tried to organize these people. Get them into a union. It was very hard at first but he kept at it until finally, you see, he got them organized. You see that, don't you? And he was the one that during the war, went to the president and told him that if he didn't issue some kind of executive order to hire black people in the war plants, he was going to have a march on Washington for jobs. And so Roosevelt hurried up then, and issued an executive order which opened up the war plants to black people to get in there and work and make some war money. That's how my daughter went in there. As a welder.
TLM: How were you aware of this, though?
MAC: No trouble, dear, to get aware of things. The newspaper, and it's
announced in every black church in the city of Boston, and everybody knows it's going to be. That's how you get it, in your churches, in your papers. Yes, when he's coming to town, just like they do now. If we're having something, it's in The Banner that next Sunday so-and-so is speaking over at Ebenezer, or on such-and-such a thing. And you get it, and all the different clubs get a notice, in the clubs; they get the names of the clubs, they send them to people and they come.
TLM: But the march on Washington movement during the forties?
MAC: They didn't have that march. They didn't have to have it, because he issued the executive order, and everybody went to work. We didn't need it. But that ended that. If they hadn't, they were going all over the country, because it was going on, not only in Boston, it was all over the United States, everywhere. They weren't﻿57
MAC: (cont.) allowed to work in these plants, and didn't get these good paying jobs that they ought to have, yet their children were in the war, and everybody else was in the war, but you couldn't get the money. So when he issued that executive order, that changed everything. They flocked into those places. That's what my daughter did. She said, so long as they got it, I may as well go there and let them know we want it. So she and a lot of other young women around went and got jobs. My daughter was a welder. She loved it.
TLM: Oh, she was?
MAC: Go down to the ships and weld...
TLM: This was Marianne?
MAC: Marianne. She loved it. At that time...
TLM: She was a welder, terrific.
MAC: ...my youngest daughter was down at Fisk. She was going to school during that time. And of course, my son, as you know, was over there fighting.
TLM: Where did he go?
MAC: He went to Italy, and where they all sent them in World War II.
Most of his service was around there, Germany and around Italy and Africa; they were in Africa. All around.
TLM: Well, what about World War II? What was life like for you personally during the Second World War? How did that compare to the First World War?
MAC: Well, of course I was much older. I had a family. And as I said,
I went to work and the depression came after it, you know, but during the war... World War II, we just had to sacrifice and make out the best we could with shortened rations and less of this and less of that. But we did it. It wasn't too hard for me.
TLM: Were you still working in Newton at that time?
MAC: Yes. It wasn't too hard for me. I made the money, and then my husband got his little pension money, whatever it was, from the veterans. They gave them to all of them.
TLM: But was he still working in the federal building at that time?
MAC: No, he hadn't gotten in there. He got in there afterwards.﻿58
TLM: And your mother-in-law, Mrs. Brown was living here?
MAC: She kept house for us; she kept this house just like I got it now.
Maybe better because she loved to cook. She cooked them everything they wanted, the kids. They had everything they wanted when I was gone. They'd come home to tell me what Granny cooked. What she cooked and what she did and what I...you know, used to say, "you didn't," and all. They had a good time when I was gone. They had everything. Well, she was here every day, she moved in here with us when we came here.
TLM: Was your husband home too? So they had their father and their Grandma at home.
MAC: Oh yes, they had a picnic. I used to have to come home to straighten everybody out. And when I would come home, my mother-in-law would say to me, "Now, don't start laying the law down. We're getting along all right." I'd say, "Well, why won't they do this thing? Why don't they do this and that?" "Oh, they will. They will." They got away with it, but they had a good time.
TLM: Well, then during the war your daughter was working too.
MAC: Well, my daughter Marianne was married.
TLM: Oh, I see.
MAC: Yes. Marianne was married and living down the housing development, and the only one here was my boy, my... Who was home? Melanie was the only one here, as she was in school. She was here. She was going to school during that time.
TLM: I see, so she was the spoiled one.
MAC: Yes, she was finishing high school. She went to college right after that, went down to Fisk. Yes, she was here, and my boy was here part of the time until he was drafted.
TLM: I see. This was still just before the war?
MAC: Yes, around that time.
TLM: And then during the war, your son went away to the war, and Melanie went to Fisk and...
MAC: ...Marianne was married and living in her own house down in the housing development.
TLM: And your mother-in-law and your husband were here, and then your husband got the job at the federal building...﻿59
MAC: Afterwards. After the settling, the quietening down of that...they called him for that job. Because he had taken the examination and was on the list, waiting for that job.
TLM: What organizations did you belong to at that time?
MAC: Oh, I belonged to all, dear. I belonged to the NAACP ever since I was a young woman and I...
TLM: Any new ones?
MAC: ...belonged to the Women's Service Club, I belonged to the Massachusetts State Union of Women's Clubs.
TLM: By that time you had joined the Women's Service Club?
MAC: Oh yes, and the Massachusetts State Union of Women's Clubs; there
were about thirty or forty clubs at that time. We had a federation. I joined the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, which has headquarters in Washington...
TLM: When did you join that group?
MAC: We all went into that, the Women's Service Club. I've been in it
about thirty years. The NAACP, the Urban League. The Urban League was thriving.
TLM: When did you join the Women's Service Club? In the thirties?
MAC: I've been in it about twenty-five years, so you can figure it out. [About 1950.] Well, I think before I joined the Women's Service Club, I belonged to Massachusetts State Union of Women's Clubs, and we joined the national. So after I joined that, we came into the national too. They joined as a part of the national association, but they weren't in it, when I was. After I joined them, we sort of got going on that. They were just an independent social service club, right here in Boston.
TLM: So you joined the national group and the Massachusetts group first? And was Mrs. Brown still involved?
MAC: Oh yes, she was involved in her things till she died, dear. She was in all these things long before me. One of the founders of them, helped to get it together. She's always been active.
TLM: Did your husband belong to any particular organization?
MAC: Well, he belonged to the Knights of Pythias, which was a lodge, and he belonged to the Masons, which is a lodge, and he was in the Fathers' Club of Robert Gould Shaw House when the children were in﻿60
MAC: (cont.) Shaw House. He was one of the Fathers' Club, and he was a member of the American Legion after he came home from the army, and I was a member of the American Legion Auxiliary. I still am. He was commander of his post and worked with the Legion. After he came out of the service, he joined the Legion, the American Legion.
TLM: And then you were involved at Saint Mark's?
MAC: Oh yes, I belong to Saint Mark Congregational Church and worked there. I am chairman of Social Action committee and belong to the Pastor's Club and the Missionary Guild. These are church clubs.
TLM: When did you join those organizations?
MAC: After I joined the church. You can't join them until you belong to the church, I've been in them about twenty-five or thirty years now, I guess. You join the clubs after you get in the church. You find out what you'd like to do, and you get yourself into whatever segment of service in the church you want to perform.
TLM: Tell me about your religious life. Can you describe the role that the church played in your life? Was it important?
MAC: Well, the church played a certain...no, not too important. I don't consider church as too important. I think you get your basic Christian training in your home, all your life. I was taught, you know, how to live as a Christian, not so much Christian, but as a good citizen, a good person, with good morality and good ideas of how to live, and I think that's all Christianity is. And churches don't bother me. I think church is nothing but an organization of people who want to go there when they want to, and it's not a matter of life and death to belong to a church, unless you want to. I say if you know how to live every day, you live every day. You don't need to go to church to find that out. You ought to have that, if you have church training all your life, it helps you. But if you are a person who really knows how to live and how to conduct your life as you go along each day, you can help the church when you go to it, because some need it. But I like the church, and I think it's a great institution for getting people together, and getting them to understand that they have something else besides material things on this earth, that there's something else to come, and to work towards living better very day. That's all it is. Teach them how to live. Because you're going to die anyway. But it's not how you die, it's how you live. That don't matter about dying. I think people ought to know how to live every day. And if the church doesn't teach them that, it's no good. To me. I think the church's direction is to teach them, and if you already know it... I already knew that before I ever joined any church; I was taught that from a little girl. So I knew what it was to live right and do the proper things, and certain things in life you can't do. You got to obey the law of the land you live in; you got to respect the people﻿61
MAC: (cont.) you're with; and you have to have some understanding of the people, and know they're just like you, and entitled to just as much as you, and all those kinds of things are basic Christian principles. You get that in your home, if you have a good home. And then when you go to church, you join the organization of people that are doing it, and you can help to do it too.
TLM: Well, thinking back to your childhood and your home, was there a person in your family who particularly helped to stimulate this philosophy?
MAC: Well, my mother must have been that way, because we started out,
little tiny children, going down to Ebenezer Church on Sundays. She went every Sunday, and when she died, of course, we couldn't go with her any more, but my aunt had us going just the same, and doing the same thing over and over again. So I always had that kind of training from a little tiny girl.
TLM: How often, when your children were growing up, how often did you attend church?
MAC: I used to go when I could. I'd go just as often as I could, but
they went every single Sunday, to Sunday school. My children went to Saint Mark's Church when they moved out here. They went to Twelfth Baptist when they were in town. And as soon as they moved out here, they went right over to Saint Mark's and went to Sunday school; sang in the choir, worked in the church and did everything in there, until they got grown and wanted to do something else.
TLM: So your kids went every Sunday, but you didn't. How often did you go?
MAC: I didn't go every Sunday. I'd go probably about once a month or
every two, three Sundays or something. I'd go when I felt like it. Always go to things that they were in over there, for the choir, little concerts and little plays they had and things like that. My husband and I both went, always.
TLM: How about now?
MAC: Well, I go to church. I try to go about every other Sunday anyway. Some Sundays I go to other churches than my own. People belong to other churches that I like to go to, and I like to attend other churches. I don't go to my church every single Sunday. I go down here to Reverend Haynes, Mike Haynes; I've known him from a young boy, he's a minister of Twelfth Baptist. I go to his church some Sundays. Go back to visit Ebenezer some Sundays. If I feel like something's going on there that I want to go to, I attend it.
TLM: So you just decide that this Sunday you'll go to...﻿62
MAC: If I want to, but I belong to this church, but I go mostly to my own church, every Sunday if I can. And if I can't, I go to some other churches. And some Sundays I don't go to church at all. It's just the way I feel.
TLM: Do you go to church on holidays?
MAC: Well, we don't have too many holidays, only Christmas and Day and things like that, in our Protestant churches. We too many days like the Catholics. Of course, I always go you know, that's just another Sunday. It's no big thing. New Year's and those kind of things. Easter is a holiday church.
TLM: You go to those? You go to Saint Mark's?
MAC: Saint Mark's, yes. Palm Sunday, things like that. We like to he there for that because that's our holiday, Sundays. Once in a while, we have a special program in church that you like, you go to that. The Choir Guild gives concerts, and all kinds of things going on in our church that you can attend other than just the Sunday service, you know. You go to the other things. Try to help with it.
TLM: You've told me about your participation in church, and you've also told me about some organizations that you belong to. I'd like to review those organizations and then also, because as we review them, I'd like you to tell me what offices you held in the organizations.
MAC: In some of them. Well, you get that biography, that tells you everything I'm in. Just read that and you'll see everything, because I forget them, you know. I forgot what they are, to tell you the truth. Here it is here. Things I belong to. They're some of them there.
TLM: Okay. It says here, the Pansy Embroidery Club.
MAC: Yes. That's one of the clubs in the Massachusetts State Union I told you about. That's one of them. There were forty clubs in there, and I belonged to that one, and I belonged to another one. I belonged to one called the Harriet Tubman Mothers' Club, and I belonged to the Sojourner Truth Club, and the Pansy Embroidery Club, all in that little federation. Those were just women's social clubs. And Friendship Club, I told you about. They were in there.
TLM: Did you hold any offices in those clubs?
MAC: Yes, well, most every one of them I was president of. Every one of them. And all other kinds of offices.
TLM: Did you help to create those clubs?
Mother s don't have because, We have in our﻿63
MAC: Well, the only one I really helped to create was the Friendship Club, down in the Shaw House. I told you about that.
TLM: The other clubs, such as the Pansy Club or the Harriet...
MAC: That was already going. And I just joined it. I became president of all of them, and held other offices in them, besides president, too. Like secretary, and anything I could fill in and help do.
TLM: Are you still a member of, does the Pansy Embroidery Club still —
MAC: No, all the members are dead, there's only about two or three left. It would be about sixty-five years old, I guess, nearly, if it was going. But most of the people are gone that were members of that. We got two or three now in rest homes and different places,
incapacitated people.
TLM: Can you name some of the members of those clubs?
MAC: What do you mean? That are living?
TLM: Yes, or just some...
MAC: Well, there are two or three living. Mrs. Taylor. Mrs. Taylor is
living. She's active like I am. And we just lost one, Mrs. Holton, just about two weeks ago.
TLM: Can you give me first names? Mrs. Taylor's first name?
MAC: Alice. She's one, and then...we have one living, Martha Warner.
And then Viola Ryder, and let's see, who else is living... I think that's about all that's active around, as far as I can remember. That are really around now.
TLM: And what kinds of things did you do?
MAC: Well, it was called Embroidery Club, see, the name. We used to sit and do all kind of embroidery work. Crafts and punch work, and embroidery, and crocheting and knitting, and all that kind of thing, we did just to go out and have a social club. We'd serve a collation and enjoy ourselves, that's all. And then we used to belong to this Massachusetts State Union, we'd attend conventions of that, and the business meetings of that, and pay our dues in that. Then we'd contribute to some charities, like helping a child with a scholarship. And we'd raise money and help some family that needed help. And we visited the sick. We used to go to see the people that were shut in that we knew, have names of them and carry them fruit, perhaps give a little money and all. We gave affairs and raised our money, like giving suppers and musicals and all kind of things.﻿64
TLM: Oh, musicals?
MAC: We used to present some young woman who was a singer. We'd present her in concert. Somebody like Roland Hayes; we even presented him once. And people like that, and raised money to put in our treasury to do our work.
TLM: Now, this was the Embroidery Club?
MAC: Pansy Embroidery Club. That's what they did.
TLM: And the Harriet Tubman Mothers' Club?
MAC: That's now, you know, part of the Harriet Tubman new building down here. They're still going. That club's still going. There's a bunch of new people that live in the South End.
fLM:	And what did you do as part of the Harriet Tubman Club?
MAC:	Well, I was vice-president of it for a number of years.
TLM:	When was that, in the twenties?
MAC:	I don't remember, to tell the truth. It's so far back.
TLM:	Well, was it between the two wars? Or was it after World War II?
MAC: Oh yes, probably might have been between the two wars, because most of all those things I belonged to when I was right down there, before I ever come here, and I been here forty-seven years, so it's all along my coming-up days, I joined those things. And was still in them, along in that era. And the Harriet Tubman House was down on Holyoke Street, and that was a house where girls from the South came to go to work, to school, and couldn't stay in the dorms, and they had a building where they kept these girls. They had a house mother, and they had everything there for them to live. And that was what our little club just became, a Mothers' Club there, because there were children around in that community, and one or two of the little workers brought them in for different classes and different things. So we formed a Mothers' Club to kind of support that effort. That's all that was for. That's down in the South End.
TLM: I see. Now, did you belong to both the Embroidery Club and the Harriet Tubman Mothers' Club at the same time?
MAC: All of them at one time. All of them together.
TLM: And the Friendship Club?
MAC: All of them at one time. That's right.﻿65
TLM: Okay. And what other club was part of the Massachusetts State Union that you belonged to at that time?
MAC: One called the Sojourner Truth, that my mother-in-law was
president of, and I used to be secretary of that. That was a community... that was a kind of a social club and community based, doing all kinds of things.
TLM: Where was that located?
MAC: Well, they met from house to house. They had no special place.
Just like the Pansy Embroidery, we didn't have anywhere to meet. We met in each other's houses. Meet here sometimes; they'd meet at one of the other ladies' houses. We had about twenty-five or thirty members, so they would meet in the different one's houses. You know.
TLM: What sorts of activities did the Sojourner Truth...
MAC: Same thing. Just social club, doing a little charitable work here and there, and trying to help in whatever was going on in the community, take part.
TLM: And you belonged to that at the same time...
MAC: Yes, all of them, I belonged to all of them.
TLM: Yes? And tell me something, if you belonged to all of those organizations, did the other members overlap too?
MAC: No, they belonged... Some of us belonged to the same thing. Most of them belonged to the same things, and some only belonged to one and wouldn't join any of the others. Just according to a person's feelings. They didn't want to be in this one or didn't want to be in that one.
TLM: So it wasn't always the same members?
MAC: Oh no. Oh no, they were altogether different people. No, some of those people in the Pansy Embroidery Club didn't belong to anything but just that one club; they didn't want to be in any more. And some of them had other things: They belonged to the Elks, they belonged to the Eastern Star.
TLM: Did you belong to any of those groups?
MAC: No, I never belonged to lodges. But they belonged to church groups. Church groups keep you busy, you know, with work for the church. You can work every day in a church club, because they've got to raise money.
TLM: But you weren't involved with the church clubs?﻿66
MAC: Yes, I was. When I joined the church, I became involved, I told you already, three or four clubs over there.
TLM: Oh, I see. Wait, I still want to find out more about Sojourner Truth. What offices did you hold?
MAC: Secretary, just secretary. I helped my mother-in-law. She was president. And I served as secretary for a few years.
TLM: And who else was a member of that? Can you name some first and last names?
MAC: Well, I don't remember too many of those women because most of them were older women like my mother-in-law. There was one there, Mrs. Jackson, a Mrs. Minnie Wright.
TLM: Mrs. Jackson's first name, do you know?
MAC: I think it was Mary, as I remember it. And there was a lady there, Mrs. Jones. I can't think of what her name was now. I used to call her Pritchett, I think her husband's name was Pritchett. So they called her Pritchett Jones. And I don't remember who else belonged to that now, but they were older women than me.
TLM: I see. So you were one of the younger women in the Sojourner Truth group?
MAC: Well, several others were in there too. I can't remember who they were now.
TLM: And about how many members do you think that organization had?
MAC: Oh, they probably had about twenty-five, thirty.
TLM: How about the Harriet Tubman Mothers' Club? How many women?
MAC: Oh, when they started out organizing, they had about fifty, I guess. They had quite a number of women from the community that joined that to support the Harriet Tubman House.
TLM: And the Embroidery Club, the Pansy Embroidery Club?
MAC: About twenty-five.
TLM: And the Friendship Club was how large?
MAC: They were sixty-five, seventy-five. It was a community club. We met in the Shaw House, of course, in this big...all from the community. The others were social clubs, and they only had just their friends or whoever they wanted to join. That's a lot different.﻿67
TLM: But the Friendship Club actually met at the...
MAC: ...community center. It was a community club, you see, for the
people in the community. Didn't have to know anybody to join, you just come in and ask if you could join it, and they'd take them in. Then finally they got it so the place was so small, couldn't take any more, so I think we ended with a seventy-five limit, a big club. It was too big, yes.
TLM: What sorts of activities did the Friendship Club do?
MAC: Well, the Friendship Club was supportive first to the kindergarten,
as I told you. Trying to help with our preschool kindergarten, that's how they came into existence. Mothers had the same ideas about their children going there, and became a little club. It was small in the beginning. Then after we became Friendship Club, we just branched out to do more community service work, other than just for our settlement house. But the settlement house came first. They bought a camp during that period. We helped to pay for things at the camp, furnished the place, raised money to do it. Then also put money aside to help send the kids up there, to pay so much on their tuition, so that mothers wouldn't have to pay the whole thing and subsidize that, you know, because... All were poor, but when you give some kind of entertainment or something, and raise two or three hundred dollars, you got that in your treasury, and you use that to help with all these causes that you got. We used to make sometimes two or three hundred dollars, sometimes five hundred, the fairs we gave, according to what kind of fair we gave. We used to give bazaars, fairs, all kind of things, to raise money, you know, penny sales.
TLM: Well, each of those organizations probably had its fund raising events.
MAC: Oh, everybody had something different that they wanted to do, and they'd do what they want.
TLM: How many fund raising events were you involved in, in a particular year?
MAC: Well, whatever they had. Whatever they had, I had to help with it, because if you're a member of ten of them, you have to help them. Get out and sell tickets and do what you can to help. You can't just say, because I belong to the other one, I can't do nothing for this one. You shouldn't join it if you can't help it. So we used to sell tickets to friends, and they sold tickets to me, so I'd sell them one. It wasn't any bother, any trouble, selling tickets.
TLM: What offices did you ever hold in the Friendship Club?﻿68
MAC: Well, I was one of the organizers of the Friendship Club, and I was one of the presidents and secretary and whatever...chairman of committees, anything. We all took the jobs, you know, and I helped to get it together, so naturally I had to hold the office quite a while as president. I was president a couple of times of that one. Yes.
TLM: You helped to establish the kindergarten when the club was formed?
MAC: Yes, we got that together. Then we got the nursery school, and we became the Friendship Club; we still helped to support the nursery school. We used to raise money and donate something to the nursery school every year. That was part of our charities. See, when we raised our money, we'd budget it out, and see how much we raised, sometime five or six hundred, seven hundred dollars, whatever we raised, we'd portion it out to certain things. Some would go to that. Some woul-d ^o to maybe the... send some kid to college, whatever, help with different things. There's always something in the community, you know. Then we used to send things away to schools in the South and help them too. And before the United Negro College Fund came, we'd do that. But after that came, then we had that on our list. We always sent something to them. Or the NAACP and everything, Urban League, all these things we tried to help.
TLM: Can you tell me about your participation in the NAACP?
MAC: What do you mean?
TLM: You were always an active member...
MAC: Yes, well, to get memberships, that's the main thing I used to do. Try to get people to join it.
TLM: Did you serve on any of the committees?
MAC: Plenty of the committees, dear. Most everything in there, I guess, from one to the other. I don't guess there's any committee in there I haven't worked on.
TLM: Was that later on? You were in the Embroidery Club, Harriet Tubman Mothers, Friendship, Massachusetts State Union, Sojourner Truth, you were also in the National...
MAC: ...Association of Colored Women's Clubs. Sure and we have a Northeastern Region of it. I've worked in that.
TLM: And then also you were a member of the NAACP then, too.
MAC: Oh yes. Then I belonged to the region of the National...see, we're divided into regions. The Northeastern Region here on this side of the country is one that I've functioned with here. We divided it into regions...﻿69
TLM: Is this the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs?
MAC: Yes, we're divided into regions. We have a Northeastern Region, a Southeastern, Central, a Northwestern and Southwestern. They have a half a million women. Maybe more.
TLM: And did you ever hold an office in this region?
MAC: Oh yes, I was president of the region. Chairman of the board...
TLM: Do you remember any dates?
MAC: No, I don't remember.
TLM: Well, let me just get an estimate. Was this before World War II or after World War II?
MAC: Oh, this is probably World War II and all along, I was in it all the time.
TLM: Were you an officer?
MAC: Yes, I've been an officer ever since I joined it. I first went in
as secretary; then I came to be chairman of the board; then I became vice-president at large; and then I became president. And so now I'm still in it, and I'm chairman of the By-laws Committee; I've been parliamentarian. I've held all kinds of jobs in it. At present, I'm chairman of the By-laws Committee, revision of by-laws for the next two years. But now in the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, I was vice-president.
TLM: In the national organization?
MAC: Yes, chairman of the board, on the executive board, all of those things.
TLM: When was this?
MAC: I don't remember the dates so much.
TLM: Was this in the fifties? Forties?
MAC: Yes, I guess it's been in the fifties. Hasn't been too long ago that I held those offices because I didn't... Came out of the vice-presidency because I was afraid I might be nominated for president. I was getting old and I didn't want to. So I wouldn't run for that. Came out of that office automatically, but there was a lot of pressure. They didn't want me to. But I realized that if you're vice-president of anything, you ought to be ready to take on the presidency. It's a great big job, and I really wasn't able to do it at that time, just about ten years ago.﻿70
TLM: Oh, ten years ago? So that was in the sixties. Okay. How about your affiliation with the NAACP?
MAC: Well, I started out with, as I say... My mother-in-law took me into the NAACP, and I worked with that, anything I could do. Getting members, attending the meetings, serving on the various committees, all kind...housing and everything else, education, and any committee that they had that I could work on. I worked on, I guess, almost every committee except the ministers' committee, the religious committee. That's for men. Mostly for men. Now it's for women, but it was just for men. But with the NAACP, I guess there's nothing in there I haven't really done that's action oriented and, of course, I became the second woman president in the history of it. They had one woman ahead of me and I was the second person.
TLM: Who was the other?
MAC: Mrs. Florence LeSueur. She lives down in Brockton, was the first woman and I'm the second. I came along about '54, I think it was, around that, '56. So now I'm on the board; stay on the executive board all the time; they always just see that I'm on that one, so I'm still on that. And with the National Association of Colored Women's...I'm now a board member emeritus by vote of the body, so I'll always be a member of the board, and don't have to worry about working on the various committees any more if I don't want to.
TLM: I'm reading from the biography that was prepared... Is this the biography that your daughter...
MAC: Yes, my daughter worked it together.
TLM: And it lists your affiliation and all the offices that you held in a number of organizations. Now, it says that you were president of the Boston branch of the NAACP from 1962 to '64. So that was in the sixties.
MAC: That's right. I thought it was before, but it's later.
TLM: Okay. Can you tell me about that period? Because this was the time when the civil rights movement was active.
MAC: Oh, we were very active with all the civil rights movements. We
had meetings with the people. We had a meeting of the board every single month, and we had a branch meeting every single month, which all the members were eligible to come to.
TLM:
All right, we were talking about the NAACP, and I also wanted to know about your participation and leadership during the time of the civil rights movements.﻿71
MAC: Of course with the civil rights movement, there was action all the time, something going on all the time. Because the NAACP, as you know, led in that whole civil rights movement, and all of our branches all over the country were alert to everything that was going on in their own community. And on a national level, when we needed united strength to get together for petitions or for hearings or in your state house, or wherever you're going, or to Washington, we had to be prepared to have people to go to represent us. And we always had people who could represent us, lawyers who understood what it was all about, who really helped us, you know, during those times.
TLM: Do you remember specific events, any particular events during that period that stand out in your mind? Either in the fifties or the sixties?
MAC: Well...Jet's see. Of course one of the things that I think we participated in a great deal was the registration of voting in the South.
We did a lot towards pushing that here.
TLM: What sorts of things?
MAC: Well, they had meetings, had mass meetings, and we also had people who went to Washington when they were trying to see the legislators to get the bill through, and worked on our own state to help to get it through, in each state, you know, with their political influence. The governor, and so forth, the legislature. And then we also had, as I say, the representatives who could go to Washington and appear whenever there was a hearing; we had letters and petitions going to everybody who could help us with those movements. We had some very serious trouble down there when we were trying to get the vote and people were being persecuted, when they were being maligned and so forth. And we sent money to them to help them in Mississippi, in Alabama, to those branches, to help them to fight their fight. And we also, during one of the protests that they had there, they had what they called Tent City. And the people were denied jobs because they were in the NAACP vanguard down there. We sent canned goods and clothing and everything to them to try to help them. We had to get together and corral them to do that sort of thing, several times. And then also we had to keep alert to what was going on, so that we could, as I said, take our part and let the government know that we all are with them. Because they couldn't do it by themselves. They needed our support. That's one of the things that I remember vividly during that period.
TLM: Going back to the fifties, do you remember events such as the Supreme Court decision about schools and some of the fights for desegregation that were going on in the South? Do you remember any specifics about that time? What was going on in your life?
MAC: Well, of course those were the things that I've just said we always helped with. And some of us couldn't go to them or...personally, but we always had people who could go, to help us.﻿72
MAC: (cont.) The NAACP, I might say that you couldn't...I can't pinpoint too many things definitely, because whatever came up during that period we did it. And we had a lot of meetings to inform the public. We had the branch meeting when I was president, every month. And a chairman of various committees would head up the program, and they would bring before the people whatever was going on at the time, so they could get informed on what's going on and could help them.
TLM: Who worked with you in the NAACP then?
MAC: You mean committees?
TLM: Yes.
MAC: Well, I don't remember too good. There were a whole slew of people
there. We had Kenneth Guscott there as one of the vice-presidents, a fine young man who came into office behind me.
TLM: How was he related to the Guscott who was in the Friendship Club?
MAC: His mother. Yes, his mother and I have been friends for years. And then we had Keesler Montgomery there, who is now clerk of the court up in Roxbury. We had Mrs. Rheable Edwards, who is now head of the Early Childhood Development for the HEW, and we had Ed Cooper, who was serving as our executive director, and did a lot of public relations in the office and all around. We had Mrs. Taylor whose name you just saw there as one of the board members and... I can't think of any more right this minute. We had Hansford Brown who was quite a young man, very active with the NAACP, and his wife, Edith Brown. We had... Well, that's quite a few.
TLM: How large was this chapter?
MAC: The board. The board was about thirty. It always is, about thirty or thirty-five people are on the NAACP board. That's a regular membership, and during my administration, we had a membership drive that brought in five thousand members. It was the largest membership they had in many years. And they haven't had one since that brought in that many.
TLM: Was it during your presidency of the NAACP that the first demonstrations happened with the School Committee?
MAC: Well, we had some during my term as president there. We had some, yes. We had some, quite a few and sit-ins.
TLM: Did you participate in any of these?
MAC: Yes. Sit-in. I have a picture out there of a sit-in in the Boston School Committee.﻿73
TLM: Can you tell me a little bit about that?
MAC: We'd get them together, those who were willing to do it. You have
to ask people if they're willing to participate in these things, and you stage it. Your education committee stages it, and then you get your members to volunteer to go, because everybody doesn't want to go. And they're still a good member, but they still don't want to do that. But we did have the sit-ins down there with the Boston School Committee, to impress on them the fact that this thing was in front of them, and this school desegregation idea was their... racial imbalance, we called it then. And Royal Boiling, who was the first black representative we had up there, one of the first...
MAC: "Balance" was how we started out here in Massachusetts, getting that before our legislature as a supplement to the national idea of investigating the public schools. So we would get our group together, and call it out at a board meeting that we'd want to have a sit-in, and we're going to organize a sit-in. Well, we'd organize a sit-in, you already had that, and we'd get volunteers to do that. And we'd go down there then to the Boston School Committee, and just go right in and talk with them, probably on a little something that we'd want to bring before them. And they never paid any attention to you anyway, so then when they'd get through with the meeting, we'd stay there. That's how you organize it, you stay there. And they want to put you out, and call the police, or they'd do anything they want to. If they want to, but we'd sit there.
TLM: Did you actually particpate in that?
MAC: Yes, I have a picture. You can look at it in the hall there. They took a picture of me at the sit-in.
TLM: Had you participated in any sit-ins before that, or were those your first sit-ins?
MAC: No, I'd been to one before. The same thing, for the School
Committee. We had two, three, five and ten because Vernon Carter was walking up and down the streets, you know, in protest against the whole thing. Every once in a while, we had a sit-in. Just a demonstration,that's all. We'd march up and down. I'd done that too, in front of the place, with the group, march a certain length of time. Oh yes, and carried a banner and everything. That's just a part of it.
TLM: These demonstrations came about mainly because of the School Committee?
MAC: Well, these were. These types were, but there were other kinds of protests beside that, but this one happened to be about the School Committee, and trying to get them to see the point, in trying to﻿74
MAC: (cont.) listen to what you had to say, and trying to act on some of the recommendations that came in from the NAACP.
TLM: So did you___ You actually went down and carried a sign?
MAC: Well, I carried a sign a couple of times. That wasn't anything.
Because you went shopping, you'd go by... They had the picket line out there going; you'd just take a sign and walk around a little while, and then give it to someone else. That's the way they keep them going. If you could go down a certain length of time, in the day when nobody else could, you'd go. You would sign your name up to go and you'd go from eleven to two, or from twelve to three, or whatever you wanted to do, just to say you participated and tried to help. But of course for the sit-in, that was... One sit-in that I was in, a mostly definite sit-in, was very crucial because we had... a group there, and I thought I wouldn't sit in that day, because I had been to others, you know, and it was tiresome and everything, but uhey b^ld that they were going to arrest them, because they had trespassed and were doing...whatever they were. They said they were against the law, so they called me up, and asked me would I come down and sit-in there, because he said if I did, they don't think they would arrest them, you know. So I went.
TLM: Who called you up?
MAC: One of the young men there. So I went down, and I sat in with them at the demonstration.
TLM: Do you remember any other participants?
MAC: Yes, the picture's right there. Get the picture. I can tell you the names. Ruth Batson and Kenneth Guscott. Right on the table.
TLM: Okay, this is the sit-in, "Boston School Committee, 1963."
MAC: Yes, that's Ruth Batson, Rheable Edwards, Jo Holley, Kenneth
Guscott, Hansford Brown. Let me see some of the names. I can't remember. Ruth Batson's daughter, I can't remember her name. And that's Josephine Holley, that's George Guscott. And that's Ruby— I can't think of her last name. She's a great worker with the NAACP. Some of those I can't remember. [Telephone rings] Hello. Yes. Yes. Well, I'll do the best I can to get there as I said. I'll be at the city hall. I'll take a cab and come out there. I'll get there before they get through anyway. All right. Bye.
TLM: Is there anyone else you recognize.
MAC: I can recognize all of them but I can't call their names; too bad, but that's the way my memory is. But most of them I called there.﻿75
TLM: MAC:
TLM: MAC: TLM: MAC:
TLM: MAC:
TLM: MAC:
TLM: MAC:
So most of the audience here are members of the NAACP.
Yes, they're all practically, were all friends of it, or interested in the bill that was up before the legislature, trying to get the School Committee...
Where... Oh, this is at the School Committee. That's on Beacon Street.
You weren't the president of the NAACP at that time?
No, not then. I had finished my term, I guess. Kenneth was the president. He was the president under that. But we had them in my time too. Just about the same thing.
Was that the demonstration you went to where they were going to arrest you?
Yes, and he said if I would come... He said, "I think if you came down here, they wouldn't arrest us, because they wouldn't dare to do it." So I said, "Well, I'll come." So they sent for me and I came down. So when I came down the policeman said, "What do you want?" They knew me too. I said, "I'm going in to the sit-in, to the demonstration." "Oh," he said,"you are?" I said yes. So he opened the door and let me in. They were locked in there. Well anyway, when I got upstairs, I went and I sat down with them a long time, so the police officer said, "Well the time is nearly up, you have to leave."
Were you in there several hours?
Oh, about an hour or two, maybe. A couple of hours. And so finally, he...they must have called up the station house, or the precinct over that way and told them I was there. So the captain said, "Well, then you can't arrest anybody." He said, "If Mrs. Cass is there, don't start any arrests." So we stayed another hour. We got the message from somebody, that said they weren't going to arrest anybody. So that was what they felt, that I saved the day that day by being there. So that was quite an affair that night. The streets were full of people, they were all out there demonstrating. You see, there was a demonstration going on.
When this picture was taken?
Yes, we were inside demonstrating and they were outside demonstrating. A couple hundred people in the street, I guess. They were getting so tired of it, you know, trying to get something done, and they couldn't do it, so they were just going to sit there. They were going to sit all night if necessary. So they did it. They went out, oh, about one o'clock at night, I guess, we marched out.﻿76
TLM: And then you came home?
MAC: Oh yes, we all came home. Everybody came home. They brought
you home. They had cars and everything else. So we came home.
TLM: What was that like? Was that an exciting time, or exhausting? Or was it sad?
MAC: Well, it was... No, it wasn't exactly exciting, but it was sad to think that you had to do all that, just to get your point over, you know. It just really made you feel very depressed, to think you have to keep on doing that. You can't make a headway at all, make a little dent in the thing, you know, you'd like to just feel like you were progressing, but we weren't, you see.
TLM: But was it also exciting or no?
7'tAC: Yes, it's exciting in a way; in a way it wasn't. We didn't take it as any kind of excitement or anything; we took it as a very serious thing, and a calamity happening to us as black people, trying to get something done, and couldn't impress anybody. That was the whole thing. People were... You could see from faces of the picture I showed you, they're all very serious and depressed and very worried.
TLM: How was this different from the meetings you described that were organized by William Monroe Trotter?
MAC: Well, there's quite a difference, because it's a different issue.
This issue here is right at your hand, and with the children of today being shortchanged in their education and all. His was getting jobs for people, and protesting against lynching, and all that kind of thing, but this was right here in our own city, and our own kids, grandchildren and kids being cheated out of an education. You're trying to get the door open for them somehow or other. This girl, Ruth Batson, was one of the leaders in this movement, in this whole education movement. She was a very faithful worker in the NAACP, one of the staunch supporters of the NAACP. She and Jo Holley there, Josephine Holley, and Rheable Edwards and her husband Ray, all those people were really people who sacrificed a lot for the NAACP, who worked faithfully, and in fact all those people there, that's just a segment. There's many more.
TLM: How about comparing this, the demonstrations and meetings during the School Committee events with the meetings that A. Philip Randolph organized.
MAC: Oh, those were entirely different. They were just as enthusiastic meetings, the people just as serious about it; everybody is serious about the issue as it comes along. That was a vital issue, because it's bread and butter, and jobs for men. The homemakers, the home people, they wanted to make a living. All of them are just about as exciting as one another, but they're all separate subjects, that's﻿77
MAC: (cont.) all. But the motives are all the same; it's to open the
door of employment and equal opportunity for black people, whether it's the school, a job, or what it is. That's all it is, just asking for fair treatment. And that's what black people have had to do ever since they were freed in this country. They've been trying to work to get their equal rights with everybody else. It's very frustrating; every time you turn around, you got to have a demonstration, you got to have a law, you got to have something to give you, that tells you that you're free and that you're equal to everybody else, but when you go to test it out, it's not true. So when you go to test it out, and it's not true, you wonder what is wrong. Why have you got to do all these things, to make people understand that you're entitled to these things? Just that simple. So every time you pick up an issue, it's an issue related to something, but it's just as important as any other one. All are a piece of the whole thing.
TLM: Well, tell me about the school issue. The School Committee didn't respond to the demonstration.
MAC: No, no, of course they didn't respond to the demonstrations. If they did, you wouldn't have what you have here now, if they had corrected these things years ago, when we asked them to do it. And we saw the racial imbalance going on in the school, and the inequality in the curriculum and everything else, and tried to tell them to correct it; they could have done that. You wouldn't have any need for the Supreme Court to tell them, "Go ahead and desegregate those schools. We don't care how you do it. And you only got so much time to do it." You wouldn't have that. But this is the result of not paying attention to what you should have corrected a long time ago and prevented this. You can see that. You know?
TLM: Did you remain active in the NAACP up through the time of the court suit?
MAC: I'm still active, dear, in the NAACP. I have never stopped being
active in the NAACP, since I joined it as a young woman. I have been active in it up until today. I just went to the installation Sunday and was sworn in again on the board.
TLM: Oh, so you're a member of the board?
MAC: Oh, I am a member of the board, elected to the board every year.
TLM: Tell me about the period when the NAACP was suing the School Committee to desegregate the schools. Do you remember?
MAC: They weren't suing them. They never have sued this School Committee. You couldn't sue the School Committee, dear.
TLM: Oh. Well, then, the Garrity decision is what I'm talking about.﻿78
MAC: Oh well, the Garrity decision is what's going on now, that we're all interested in, that everybody's interested in, and the NAACP is the one that brought the suit. They brought the suit in the beginning.
TLM: How did that come about?
MAC: Because we couldn't get the desegregation any other way. So they carried a suit, to show the mothers who said their children were being shortchanged, let them tell the court themselves, and ask, "Would you please do something for my children, and all the rest of them." That was all. It was just a suit, brought to open it up and let the court know that we still want it done, see? That's all. It wasn't anything really that we could do about it. All we did, the lawyers that took the cases were well-qualified lawyers here in Boston, some of them did it for nothing. No money at all. They just wanted to do it as a civic duty. Because they know it's wrong and they want to help it. All of them. So they got these mothers whose children go to these various schools where all these inequities are going on, so they could come up and say, "Here it is. I know, because here is my child to do it." All we did was back it up and try to support them in it, that's all. We couldn't do any more. And of course, when it went to the Supreme Court in Washington, the national NAACP took the whole issue to the Supreme Court. That's when they said, "You got to desegregate the schools of America. All of you got to do it. Where it's found that there is a need, you've got it to do." So when they told Boston they had to do theirs, they ignored it. Didn't even pay any attention to it, tried to get away with it, like they were doing when we asked them, but they couldn't do it. Because you see, that's a different kind of agency telling them now. We were nothing as far as they were concerned. They had just listened to us, and let it go ahead. But when the Supreme Court said it, they knew they'd have to do something. Because they had a chance, when we brought the racial imbalance bill, to get a plan ready. We asked them to get a plan ready, to desegregate the schools. But they didn't bother getting any plan ready. So you see, that's why they resulted in the Supreme Court coming into the case, because there was nothing being done. They had to be made to do it.
TLM: By the Supreme Court, you mean Judge Garrity making his decision?
MAC: Well, of course Garrity was assigned. He's nothing in it so much.
He isn't the main thing. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People brought the suit to the United States Supreme Court through their legal department, to get the thing regulated all over this country, and stop talking about it. So it passed in the Supreme Court, that this had to be done in all the cities. Garrity is just one of the federal judges assigned to Boston. There are others assigned to other cities where this existed. But he is the one that had to carry this order out, because he's on the bench, he's assigned to this job. And they want him to do it; so he's doing the﻿79
MAC: (cont.) job for the Supreme Court; he isn't doing it for the NAACP. No, he's doing it because he was assigned by the United States Supreme Court. But we're involved in it, but they're not doing it for us.
TLM: Well, please go back and tell me about the Women's Service Club. It
says on your biography that you have been the president of the Women's Service Club for fifteen years. Now, that's past tense?
MAC: Up till now. Fifteen before this. Right now I'm president of it.
Right this day, I'm still the president, so fifteen years have passed since I've been president, and I still am the president.
TLM: What's the address of the club?
MAC: 464 Massachusetts Avenue. And it was founded by a group of women who worked together during World War I for the veterans, and when it was over, they decidf :? to eomtlnue community service, and bought this house on Mass. Avenue, and decided that they would try to do community service in the neighborhood, whatever it would be to help the people. So they bought the house, and their first project was—besides community service programs, educational programs, and all kinds of things for young people and old people—was to open up the doors for girls who came here to go to college, who couldn't get places in the dorms, to live here, and they lived there, quite a number of young women lived there for a number of years. They had a housemother; they furnished the rooms upstairs, and beautiful bedrooms for two in a room, three in a room, and made the rents very reasonable. Average was $10 a week, some of them, and some less, if they couldn't pay it. And they had a home there. And a good many fine young women, who have gone out from Massachusetts, lived there while they were going to college. Then when the [dormitory] bars were lifted on account of the desegregation change, and they were eligible to live there, that's the time, soon after that, that I came along, and we began to work with the girls from the South, who came here looking for jobs. And we called our program the In-migrant Program, and that's how we established that. About ten years ago, maybe ten or twelve years ago. So we were funded for that program by ABCD* and as a part of their social service programs in the city of Boston.
TLM: Was this for girls mainly from the South?
MAC: Yes, mainly from the South, West Indies islands, the Caribbean, and Haiti, and all the black girls particularly—and if there were any poor white ones, all right, but we didn't have any white ones—who came here looking for work, disillusioned and disappointed when they got in the work, and found they couldn't do it. Came out of the rural South, where they really didn't know about doing this kind of modern work that you had with vacuums and electrical appliances, et cetera. So they would go to work and get very disappointed. So Traveler's Aid sometimes would send them to our house. They'd be sitting in the
*ABCD, Action for Boston Community Development-﻿80
MAC: (cont.) station, bus stations, waiting for these people [employers]
to come get them, and they never showed up. So we'd bring them to our house, and we'd train them and tell them how to work, and try to find them a job if we could.
TLM: What sorts of work?
MAC: They were doing domestic work, you know, that's what they came here for. They didn't know anything else. They were picking cotton, you know, out in the fields, and all that kind of thing, and they heard, read it in the paper, that there's an agency down South would pay your fare to Boston to another agency, and give you a room in somebody's house, and you could work and make thirty-five, forty dollars a week, and all those things, your own TV, and your own this and your own that. Well, some of it turned out to be pretty good. Some of it didn't. So we were there, and we naturally could help some of them that we could get a hold of and show them, you know, the way to live in Boston, where to go and this and that. So that's a program that we had for quite a number of years. And we still got the program going.
TLM: How about the Homemakers Training Program?
MAC: Well now, that was a different thing. That's an offshoot of the
In-migrant. And that was the program that we found we needed to get something to teach these girls how to work, what to do, training in this work. So we just got together, and tried to do it, and at first, the ABCD did stretch it, the money, to help us to do it. But we didn't have the facilities there, you know, to do it the proper way. And we were going to try to raise money and see what we could do. So finally, I don't know how they heard about us, but the Department of Labor heard about the program that we were doing. And they asked us if we'd like to be a pilot program in the country. They were going to try to Improve domestic work for people. And they heard we were doing it, so they wrote us a letter, and we answered and sent them a proposal, and told them what we were doing really, and so with the Department of Labor and the Department of HEW [Health, Education and Welfare], we got a grant to do the training of these girls in Boston.
TLM: What year did you get the grant?
MAC: About eight years ago now. And they took the initiative, and really remodeled our cellar and made it into a kitchen, beautiful facility, where they received their training. Right down in our cellar; they remodeled it and paid for everything in it. We didn't have to pay any money. And they gave us a proposal, well, they gave us a budget, in which we were able to hire a director, a home economics teacher, a job developer and a secretary and a social worker at the beginning. And we advertised, and we told what kind of program we were going to have, and we were able to set it up right there, and train these girls,﻿81
MAC: (cont.) and the Manpower Development department helped us with it,
beside the government giving us the budget. I forget what our first budget was, but anyway, it was enough to cover all this administration. We got donations from the gas and electric company. We got a Frigidaire which the electric company donated, a stove from the gas company, and a lot of things donated, after they found out what we were doing. The budget called for one Frigidaire, or one this and that, so we had two things there now of each thing, so that they can learn on both, gas and electric.
TLM: I see. About how many women go through the program each year?
MAC: Well, we can have seventeen in a class, and a class is for twelve weeks, and at the end of the twelve weeks, there is a graduation. We begin all over again with another group.
TLM: Are the women who go through still pretty much women who come from
outside of Boston?
MAC: No, not now. In the first beginning, it was mostly women who were from the South, and who were wandering around, but it is for all disadvantaged women, any of them, in the city of Boston now. So we don't have any trouble training them, and some of them go to nursing homes, some of them go out to families, some of them go to hospitals, they go in all sort of related fields.
TLM: And about how old are the women?
MAC: Well, most of them... We've had them up to sixty. Yes, they can come up to sixty years old. Their ages vary; some are very young, nineteen, twenty.
TLM: So who else worked with you on the development of those two programs?
MAC: The women from the Women's Service Club, who were very active with it, but we had community people who knew what it was all about, who really drew up the proposals for us. We had two or three young people. One is Dorothy Parrish, who is now president of our auxiliary, and she and Rheable Edwards, and two or three young men in the South End—I can't remember their names this minute—who really worked with us and got the proposals ready, because they wanted us to understand what it was all about and how to do it. We didn't know anything about it. Of course at ABCD we got invaluable help because I was a founder of ABCD. We had plenty of help from there. Those are people who knew the problem.
TLM: When did you help found ABCD?
MAC: When it was organized. I forget how many years ago, but that was during the urban renewal period.
TLM: The forties, the fifties, the sixties?﻿82
MAC: 'Round in the fifties.
TLM: Who else was involved in the formation of ABCD?
MAC: Oh, ABCD was formed by the director, really it was the idea of Ed Logue, who was the director of urban renewal [Boston Redevelopment Authority]. He told the mayor, who then was John Collins, that they needed a social service agency or humanitarian organization for these people whose houses they're tearing down and taking away, and he said there had to be something else besides just walking in and telling them you're going to take their house. So the mayor thought about it, and he said he guessed that was right, and he called together some people, community-minded people, to talk about it, and we went down to city hall and talked to him, and decided to get it going in someway or other. That was Freedom House, with Muriel Snowden and Otto Snowden, and all of us out here in this area assisted. The mayor applied to Ford Foundation, who gave the first million dollars to get this whole thing started.
TLM: And you were on the board in the beginning there?
MAC: Yes. So they decided we would have the money, and go ahead and form
what we called The Community Action Program. It had to be incorporated, so there were quite a number of men called to incorporate, and I was the only woman, so I'm the only woman incorporator for the city, for ABCD. Because I've been on the board all the years of its existence and I am now an honorary board member.
TLM: Oh, that's something.
MAC: I feel very proud of that, and when they brought the people together
to incorporate that day, I was looking around, and I said to the mayor, "This is kind of discriminatory, just one woman." He said, "Well, you represent the whole community, and you can do that very nicely." So I was the only community person on it; the others were business people, and people who were going to put money in and try to promote it. It's quite an experience, that ABCD, because it turned into... after the urban renewal became a permanent fixture in the city of Boston for community action amongst the poor, they have all sections all over the city of Boston really working hard with community activities.
TLM: Well, tell me something. To put you on the spot about the ABCD
board, if you were the only community person and the only woman on the board, do you feel that in some ways you were a token member of the board?
MAC: No, I don't feel so, because I was with the urban renewal when they
first started it, and I worked right along with it, all the years that we were out here, and I was still working with it, and trying to do my part in it; so I don't think they were trying to make a token, I think they were just trying to have different segments represented.﻿83
MAC: (cont.) And as you read the names, you could see what they represented. All the different agencies, all the different segments of the community. Urban renewal for this section of Boston was just up here. It started up here by Washington Park, so they didn't have two or three people, they just had one. That was for the incorporation papers, but when the thing started, oh, my goodness, there was loads of people from all sections of this area put on it, to represent this section.
TLM: Thank you. I see from your biography that you're a member of Board of Overseers of Public Welfare?
MAC: I was, but that's no more.
TLM: What was that?
MAC: Overseers of Boston Public Welfare were the group, board people, who
were set up to help the Welfare Department to administer the services and the money that's necessary to go into welfare.
TLM: Oh, when was that? How long ago?
MAC: Well, I guess I was on it about ten years, I guess. And before me,
there was another black woman, Mrs. Beulah Hester was on it, and then I replaced her. And when I went on, there was only just one black, and that's when I really felt that was a token, but of course you can only have so many members. Because they were to administer and advise the mayor and so forth, and the Department of Public Welfare.
TLM: What mayor was that?
MAC: Collins. He was the mayor. And this was the board to advise him and others on what was necessary to be done for the welfare, to make the thing move along better. That's all that was for. They called it overseers.
TLM: But you were on that for quite a while?
MAC: Yes, I was on for ten years. And now, since the state is the
administrator of welfare, it moved from the city to the state. Some of us were retained, and I was retained amongst the others to oversee, not so much the welfare, but the trust funds that were left to the city of Boston which has millions of dollars in these trust funds. Charitable trust funds.
TLM: Oh? I don't understand.
MAC: People left money for the poor of Boston as far back as 1700s and 1800s, and they left it in trust funds to be dispensed in certain ways.
TLM: Oh yes.﻿84
MAC: They were small amounts of money that's grown into great big sums,
and now we administer that, and see that it is given out in the right directions, according to the designation of the fund and what they want done with it.
TLM: Is that a board?
1IAC: Yes, a board.
TLM: And you're still on it?
MAC: I'm still on it, and more people have been added to it, but I'm one of the old leftovers from the Board of Overseers of Public Welfare.
TLM: And how often does it meet?
MAC: Once a month. They just called a meeting. It meets about once a
month.
TLM: Oh, this was one of your phone calls?
MAC: Yes, one that is going to call me back. But once a month we meet.
Supposed to. And see what fund is eligible to be given out, where it's going. People can apply, groups of people, for projects or whatever, if it can be done, it can. There's a good bit of it given to scholarship to help children on AFDC*, with their college because they need it, $300, $400, according to need.
TLM: Does the mayor sit on the board?
MAC: No, the mayor doesn't have anything to do with it. He appoints the people, and they're all people of the city of Boston, residents who are interested.
TLM: Who heads that board now?
MAC: Well, at the present time, [Clarence W.] "Jeep" Jones is heading it, the deputy mayor, he's heading it right now. He is acting chairman, but he is holding it together.
TLM: You have been a member of the board of directors of the United South End Settlements, where you served as secretary for over ten years.
MAC: That's right. That's the one that I came on the board because I was vice-president, at the time, of the Harriet Tubman House, which is a part of the United South End Settlements. That's how I happened to get involved with it. And I'm still a member of the Board of the United South End Settlements.
TLM: I see. When did you first get on the board of directors?
* Aid to Families with Dependent Children.﻿85
MAC: Well, I guess I must have been on it now about fifteen years, maybe twenty.
TLM: And it was about fifteen, twenty years ago that you were vice-president of the Harriet Tubman House.
MAC: That's a part of it. That's a part of that. That's a part of the
United South End Settlements. Harriet Tubman was one of the buildings, one of the houses, in the United South End Settlements when it was formed. And we had several other houses around there, one on Union Park, one on Rutland Square, one on Harrison Avenue, four or five little houses. So they all come together now under one heading in the big new building, Harriet Tubman House.
TLM: How often do you meet on that board?
MAC: Well, it's supposed to meet once a month, if I can get there. But
they don't insist on me getting there. If I can't, they say I have a place there and just stay there, come when I can. I have been elected as an honorary board member at the annual meeting in June 1977.
TLM: I'm reading from your biography. You've already discussed being
vice-president of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, -and the past president of the Northeast Region. Also coorganizer of Women in Community Service.
MAC: That's the Job Corps for Girls, and that was a federal program which was launched here in Boston by five organizations—the Jewish women, the Catholic women, and the black women, which was the National Council of Negro Women. They didn't have any branch here in Boston, so they asked us if we would assume it, the Women's Service Club, and represent that part of it. That is how we got involved in that. So the Women's Service Club is Still active with the Women in Community Service, which sponsors the Job Corps for Girls.
TLM: I see. When did the Women in Community Service group come together?
MAC: Oh, they've been together about...let1s see, during the war, World War II.
TLM: So for quite a while. And is there a place where that group meets?
MAC: Yes, they now have a headquarters. They had one first in the
Department of Labor, on Huntington Avenue. Now, they're in the building that's owned by the Christian Science Church on Huntington Avenue. They have a suite of rooms... They have two or three rooms there, the headquarters for this part of New England. The formal headquarters is down in the Kennedy building, under the Department of Labor. This is a subsidiary out here in Boston. Takes care of the girls. In town they take care of the boys, at the headquarters, but that is where the business office is for this section of Roxbury and Boston.﻿86
TLM: Was there a training program?
MAC: Yes, there was a training program set up for the girls who would go
off to centers, if they wished. These girls were very disadvantaged, were dropouts, maybe, from schools, who were disillusioned, didn't know what they'd want to do. They would be interviewed by certain people who knew how to interview them, trained to do it, and find out if they'd like to go away to one of the training centers for Job Corps. There were several centers at one time, but they've closed most of them. There was one in New Jersey, one up in Maine. There was one out west some place, I forget the name. But they could go to whichever one they wanted to, if they filled in the application with their parents' consent, because they're all girls under eighteen.
TLM: And what sorts of jobs? Oh, they were young.
-MAC: They were trained there for all kinds of jobs—typing, secretarial work, even machines, all kinds of things. They were trained in photography, in beauty culture. They had a regular training school where they'd get a little bit of something, enough to come out and perhaps go on further.
TLM: But there was no connection between this group and the In-migrant Service Program? Or the Homemaker Training?
MAC: Oh no, no, this was a government program. We were just asked to help with it as a club. We gave our help, and our members joined in, and they still are working with it. Still working with it on a volunteer basis.
TLM: Tell me also about the "William E. Carter Auxiliary Number 16."
MAC: The American Legion. I joined that organization with my husband when he joined it. Well, I didn't join it right away, but after World War I. He joined it when they formed it, and he was in it until he died. And I'm still in it.
TLM: So you joined, what, maybe in the 1920s?
MAC: Oh yes, well way back, twenty-something. I've been in it thirty
years,or more than that, I guess. I've been in it ever since I've been out here, forty-seven years, I guess. More than that, fifty. I worked in it as treasurer and as president and almost everything. I just attend when I feel like it. I don't make it a special thing, a duty bound thing to go now. I go when I want to. Pay my dues, et cetera.
TLM: How many times a year?
MAC: About two or three times. I pay my dues annually.﻿87
TLM: And how large a group is the auxiliary?
MAC: Well, I guess they've got about fifty members. A small auxiliary.
TLM: Of various ages, or your generation?
MAC: Well, of course, they all had to have husbands who were in Vietnam or World War II now, because the World War I are all practically dead, like my husband. They're gone. So it's World War II, like my son, and Vietnam, who are the members now. The women in that age bracket, like I was when I joined. I'm an older one now, more retired one. And they don't expect active participation from me.
TLM: Is Auxiliary Number 16 membership mostly black women?
MAC: All black women. They might have one or two whites, but all black.
TLM: I see. This is the American Legion, and also it [written biography] says that you served for twenty years as treasurer.
MAC: Yes, I did.
TLM: You are a member of Saint Mark Congregational Church.
MAC: I told you about that. I think you already have that, the Social Action Committee and the Pastor's Club, the Missionary Guild.
TLM: Okay. Other affiliations: the YWCA.
MAC: Yes, I was a member of the YWCA for many years, and served there with their public relations and so forth, and I came out of their organiza tion, because they were so prejudiced and discriminatory in their practices there, I didn't like it, so I resigned from it. Some years ago.
TLM: Tell me about that.
MAC: Well, they had a policy, they didn't care too much about the colored children coming down there getting in the pool.
TLM: This is the main Y?
MAC: It was terrible, about thirty years ago.
TLM: On Clarendon Street?
MAC: Yes. So that was all over the country, because they had segregation, and they used it wherever they wanted to use it, those who were on the board. They weren't too open hearted to the black people, but after some years they have changed.﻿88
TLM: Were you ever on a board there?
MAC: Yes, I was on it. I resigned from it because of that. I resigned
from their board, because I didn't want to be implicated. I couldn't make any progress with it, and there were one or two other blacks on there, they didn't see eye to eye, so I got off. And I stayed off until now that they've changed their policy and opened the doors to everybody, and all are alike. They asked me to come back on their board.
TLM: How long ago was it, how many years ago was it that you got off it?
MAC: It's about thirty years, maybe more than that. Around thirty anyway.
TLM: And you just left. It was thirty years ago.
MAC: Yes, I just left and stayed away from it. I didn't bother with it
at all. Until lately; they asked me to come now. Of course they've named the Y for me, so naturally I have to be with them now.
TLM: Which Y is named after you?
MAC: Clarendon Street, the Boston branch. The in-town branch. They did that last year, you know. They named it last year for me. Changed the name to the Cass Branch. It's now called the Cass Branch.
TLM: And was there a big ceremony?
MAC: Oh yes, we had a big celebration. They had a beautiful celebration there at that time for me. I didn't know it was for me, though, because I worked with them, on their Women '76 program last year, and I helped them as much as I could and got people to help, gave them ideas on how to do it, and went on the radio with them and worked with them. They were a delightful group of young women. I never had an inkling that they were working to honor me at the affair which we were giving, this recognition to all these women, my gracious! So I was tickled to death that they were doing it. All the different women, about twenty-five of them or more were being honored. When I got there that night of the affair, I said to Topper Carew... He had sent for all those pictures of my family; he said he was going to have an exhibit, and he wanted to put some old-fashioned pictures in it? So when I got there, I said, "Where's the old-fashioned pictures exhibit? I'd like to go look at them." He said, "tfe're going to have those after the affair is over." I said, "Oh my goodness, I'll be so tired, I won't even want to look at them." He said, "Oh yes, you will. Oh yes, you will." So this little girl that's on this, Barbara Dwyer, said, "Oh yes, you will, Mrs. Cass, you'll be very glad you will see them."
Barbara Dwyer. Two or three of them worked with me. So anyway, I went along with them and sat there with the guests. I knew some of them who were being honored. I had a wonderful time. We went into﻿89
MAC: (cont.) the room for the banquet, and the program went on and
everything; finally they got down to the real program...when they were presenting all the different citations, the little gifts we had for the people, et cetera. When they got to me, the director, the president of the board said she wanted to make a presentation to me. So she announced that they were going to name their branch Y for me. I couldn't believe it.
TLM: Oh, what a surprise!
MAC: I was spellbound; I couldn't even say a word. I didn't know what to say; I didn't know what to do; and I began...tears began to go down my cheeks, and I was never so surprised in my life. I didn't know what to say happened to me. I was so surprised, shocked almost, because I didn't have any idea that they were doing that. It was really something great. I worked right along with them every day, and I didn't know what to say to them. But anyway, I managed to say something, thank them. And I couldn't get over it. So then, when they got through with all of that, the next thing I knew was that they put on the screen this whole film about my life, on that screen. Starting with that baby picture, and coming right on up with all my family, everybody, everything, and all those pitcures I gave Topper Carew. I wanted to give him a licking, but I couldn't get nowhere near him; I didn't know where he was. So, but anyway, I couldn't get over that. Well sir, I was spellbound with those pictures. And I said, "That's what he wanted with those pictures. Now I know exactly what it is." When the thing was over, I got him and I said, "No wonder you... All of you little sneaks, every one of you, little sneaks." Barbara and Mary and all of them. I said, "What are you all thinking about?" "Well, we couldn't tell you what we were going to do, you know. If we ever told you, it'd be terrible. You probably wouldn't even come." I said, "Probably I wouldn't. I'd have stayed home." But it was beautiful, that's the nicest thing that has happened to me. Oh my goodness, I couldn't believe it. So after that night, of course, they had another little reception...for Boston people, because so many of them had got a little bit from the Y, and strayed away from it, because of what happened, you know. But with the new approach to things, and their dedication to fight racism, and to bring about better race relations, made you feel so much better to be a part of it, and that's the way I feel now. I'm very happy that I'm a part of it, and expect to do all I can in my way, as long as I'm here, to help promote the Y. I think it was a great step forward in Boston.
TLM: Yes indeed. Reading again from the biography, you were on the Race and Religion Committee of the United Church Women.
MAC: Yes, I was on that some years ago, just two or three years' work
with that committee and the United Church Women. It was on racism.
TLM: About how many years ago?﻿90
MAC: Oh, that's been a long time that I was on that one. I haven't been on a committee with the United Church Women for about ten years— before then. I'm still a member.
TLM: So you're talking about at least ten years ago.
MAC: I attend a good many of the conferences, and I've spoken for them,
I spoke for them for the Bicentennial, down at the Old North Church.
TLM: Oh, you did?
MAC: Yes, I was honored, very honored. And they had me as one of the speakers. Last year. And I spoke on the contributions of black women, in Roxbury and the city of Boston, who have done things locally who have tried to do things out here for the good of the whole community. And they had one or two other speakers beside me, but that was quite an honor to speak from the Old North Church, you know. I couldn't get over that.
TLM: Yes. Did you go up in the...
MAC: Oh yes, right up in the pulpit. Yes, it was beautiful. Quite an honor. Had lots and lots of women there. It was a lovely affair.
TLM: You were president of Roxbury Council of Elders?
MAC: Yes. Well, I'm serving now as president of the Council of Elders in Roxbury.
TLM: How long have you been the president?
MAC: Well, let's see. This is one, two... This is my third year. It's practically a new council anyway. It's only had two presidents ahead of me. There was a man, Mr. Akers; and then another one, Mrs. Walker; and then me. And both of them are dead. So I'm the only living, you know. We have a program, of course, which is very extensive. It's a program under the federal government, with the Older Americans Act, for elderly; we have the nutrition program which serves meals to the elderly. We have a staff of 240 people, with a director, and of course all the other department heads, et cetera.
TLM: This is nationally?
MAC: No, no, this is Boston. We have 240 employees. We have the
homemakers, the nutrition program which, I was just trying to say, sends meals out to the shutins, and sends meals to feeding sites where groups of elderly come and congregate and have their dinner every day. We have about twelve sites already, where they send the meals. In Roxbury and Boston. We serve in Roxbury, Dorchester, Allston, Brighton, South End, Back Bay. We serve all that area.﻿91
MAC: (cont.) And we serve them every day. The meals are cooked and sent out to those who come to the site to sit down and have their dinner together, mostly in senior citizens buildings. Then a few senior citizens not living in the building come too.
TLM: And who funds the program?
MAC: The federal government, under the Older Americans Act which has these.. Title III, Title VII, and all those titles, which say what you're going to do with the money.
TLM: The nutrition program, is that interracial or is it mostly black elderly?
MAC: No, it's interracial; it's mostly black elderly, but it's interracial because parts that we serve are at the Jewish Rehabilitation Center. We're going to serve the Spanish group...cook ethnic foods for them. The foods that they eat, we cook. The menu is varied every day.
TLM: I see. "A board member of National Council of Senior Citizens."
MAC: That's national. I was elected to that about four years ago.
TLM: Is the Roxbury Council of Elders part of that national organization?
MAC: Yes, we're members of that, and many, many other groups all over the country are members of it. And many throughout Massachusetts are members too.
TLM: And how long have you been a board member?
MAC: This is my second term, going into four years. I've been on it two already, and now this is the second.
TLM:	So is that...where do you have meetings for the National Council?
MAC:	In Washington, D.C., is their headquarters.
TLM:	So you go to Washington?
MAC:	Yes, I'll be going there next week for the board meeting.
TLM:	How often are the board meetings?
MAC:	Well, we only meet about three times a year because we have a convention once a year.
TLM: Oh. Where are the conventions held?﻿92
MAC: Different parts. We're going to have one, I think the next one—
I'm not positive, I'm not sure yet, but I think it's going to be in the South. And we won't have it this year. We have a legislative conference one year, a convention the next year. The legislative conferences are always in Washington, D.C., because that's where we go to see our senators.
TLM: Do some lobbying?
MAC: Yes, we go up on the Hill and lobby. Everybody goes from one senator to the other.
TL11: Oh, what time of year is this?
MAC: It's generally in May, before the weather gets too hot.
TLM: Oh, so you're a "jet setter." You fly down to Washington.
MAC: No, I don't fly- I go on the train or by bus.
TLM: Oh, you take the train to Washington.
MAC: I never have been on a plane yet.
TLM: Oh, you haven't?
MAC: I have no desire to go in planes. I'll go on the train, I'll go
right on the train. That takes you there. Before they had planes, I was on trains. And they had buses. So I go on the train. I like the train very much. It's very comfortable, especially now they've made them over, they've remodeled them.
TLM: Do you take the day train?
MAC: I go early in the morning, because it's an eight-hour trip, and by the time I get there it's five o'clock. I like to go at eight o'clock in the morning, and I get there around five, and I rest and get ready for the meeting.
TLM: Do you stay with friends in Washington or a hotel?
MAC: No, we stay in a hotel. They make reservations for you.
TLM: You mentioned that you were in Chicago two years ago, soon after your childhood friend died. Was that also with the National Council?
MAC: That was our convention. I was out there a week.
TLM: And did you take the train or bus?﻿93
MAC: We went on the train.
TLM: Oh, there was a delegation from here, from the Roxbury Council of Elders?
MAC: Yes, we had a delegation, and then the whole Massachusetts delegation from other places, go together and we get cut rates. We get a convention rate. Yes, it was very, very nice.
TLM: Oh, you do quite a bit of traveling.
MAC: Yes, and then I go with my National Association of Colored Women's Clubs; we have a convention every two years. All over the country, or wherever the bid comes in for the highest votes, we go.
TLM: Have you been conventioneering as far as the West Coast?
MAC: Oh yes, California. We're going to Seattle, Washington, next time. Have been to Denver, Colorado.
TLM: You're going to take the train?
MAC: Yes, I've been to Denver, Colorado, and all around. Texas. Georgia. Atlanta, Georgia, last time.
TLM: This is with the...
MAC: National Association of Colored Women's Clubs. We go all over the country according to the group that asks, that invites you.
TLM: Where does the National Board of the Association of Colored Women's Clubs.. .
MAC: They have a headquarters in Washington. A club house.
TLM: You were appointed by former Governor Francis Sargent as chairman of the Advisory Committee for Elderly.
MAC: That's the first one that we had. I was chairman. I served two years, and now we have a new chairman. It's just two years old anyway. Going into its third year.
TLM: So then there are several layers of organizations. There's the Roxbury Council, and then the Advisory Committee.
MAC: Yes, the Mayor's Advisory Committee for the City of Boston Elderly; the governor has one for the state.
TLM: And then there's the national.
MAC: I'm on all of them. I'm chairman of the mayor's now.﻿94
TLM: Oh, you are? And how often do you meet?
MAC: Once a month. Going to meet Friday. First Friday in every month.
TLM: You have a busy schedule. For heaven's sake!
MAC: We have about sixty members or more, and we have attendance of at least forty, forty-five.
TLM: Where do you meet?
MAC: We meet in the city of Boston; the mayor's meets in the city hall. The governor's meets down at the headquarters for the elderly down on Tremont Street.
TLM: You were appointed by former secretary of HEW, Elliot Richardson, to serve on the National Insurance Benefits Advisory Council, representing the consumer. What year was that?
MAC: Well, I just finished my term last year, so I was on there two or three years, I think it was. Because I just finished in '76.
TLM: Please tell me about the Health Insurance Benefits.
MAC: Well, that is an organization which is advisory to the secretary of
HEW, and our section of it, particularly my appointment, was Medicare for the older people. That was my part that I represented. It dealt with health insurance, with social security and all the ramifications of social security, which is Medicare, Medicaid, and so forth. But my particular part was Medicare, because they asked me to serve on that part of it.
TLM: Tell me, what were your duties?
MAC: Well, you just attend; you go there, and you attend those conferences in Wasington. They're all held in Washington, or over in Maryland, because Social Security headquarters is in Rockville, Maryland, and we did meet there sometimes. And we met about every two months. They were very particular about when they met. Every two months, and they had to have so many, at least ten meetings a year.
TLM: You'd go to Rockville, Maryland? So you've traveled to Washington, D.C., often.
MAC: Oh, that's nothing. I don't mind that. I like to go to Washington. And of course, this particular assignment, they make a reservation for you in some of the best hotels there, and they pay for it.
TLM: That sounds like fun.﻿95
MAC: It is, and all your expenses are paid, too, which is quite unusual for me, because most of the things I go to I pay my own expenses, unless something turns up. But this government agency pays all of your expenses, everything. You don't pay anything.
TLM: On the Council for the Elderly, do you pay your own expenses?
MAC: Yes, well, the Council here in Boston gives me so much money to
cover my expenses, but you have to pay your own, all the people do. Very expensive.
TLM: Tell me, with the Health Insurance Benefits Council, did you have to do any research for that?
MAC: No, they prepared it. They have a big staff, and they prepare the papers for you, and you discuss them and you make recommendations. It's no hard work.
TLM: And the recommendations are to whom?
MAC: The secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.
TLM: Elliot Richardson.
MAC: Yes, to him, but to the one in charge of that particular division.
They have a person under him, who's in charge of that division, and you send it to them, and they finally get it to him if he wishes to use it.
TLM: Did you read the position papers, and then state your opinion on a particular issue?
MAC: We'd all discuss it, and put our part in, and then they'd come up with some flat recommendations which we think would make the thing work better in all parts of the country. Because the members are from all parts of the country and all have different problems, and they would state their part.
TLM: Well, tell me, on the Health Insurance Benefits were there
representatives of different agencies, and also age groups too, so that it was not only the elderly...
MAC: Oh no, no, they have all kind of... They have some people there from the Blue Cross; some people there from insurance companies, from all kinds of hospitals and nursing home agencies, all the people that have handling of that, so they can hear what they have to say and see if they can make the whole thing better.
TLM: I see. You were also one of the founders of Freedom House, Incorporated, in 1949.﻿96
MAC: That's right, I am.
TLM: Well, tell me about Freedom House.
MAC: Freedom House is set up iri our community as a civic center to work for the betterment of our community. It was founded by some of us who were community minded, with the young man, Otto Snowden, whose idea it was. Some of us backed him up, and went right in and helped him to get it started, and of course it's gone on now for twenty-some years, a wonderful organization.
TLM: Have you been on the board of Freedom House?
MAC: Oh, I've been on it until I got to the place where they made me an honorary board member. So I'm still on it. They felt I should be honorary; most of those who signed the paper with me, the incorporation papers, are gone anyway. Just one or two of us left.
o x am dn honorary.
TLM: Who else is still around?
MAC: John Lane. There's just about two or three of us left. I think Lucy Mitchell. And that's about all, I guess, left. Many of the charter members are all gone.
TLM: Thank you. Other firsts you've achieved in your lifetime. You were the first black woman to be elected as state president of a patriotic organization, United War Mothers of America.
MAC: That was World War II, when my son was in the army. The mothers in this state, the white mothers started it really, formed it and then they asked us here in Roxbury to join. We formed a chapter.
TLM: Was that chapter formed during the war or after the war?
MAC: During the war. We formed it during the war, so we could help them, if we could, while they were in the service, and help them when they come home to the hospitals, be on hand for whatever we could, just like mothers would, and these were mothers all over the state. There were quite a number of them that came together and formed this organization.
TLM: Does the organization still exist?
MAC: Yes, it still exists, just small portions all over the state. Most of them are old, and in the hospitals and nursing homes, and those who can hold together have a meeting maybe once or twice a year or three times a year. We, in our chapter in Roxbury, meet about three or four times a year. We go to the hospital once in a while, just the same. Carry something. And Christmas, we like to go and take something. We go through one ward or something, and give out some little books that they use to buy things in the canteen, canteen books.﻿97

MAC: TLM: MAC:
Who are some of the other women who are still involved?
Well, we have one, our president now is Mrs. Elsie Joseph; and we have a Mrs. Eloise Jones who was the state president; she's had a stroke but she's—we still call her that. And then we have Mrs. Martha Brothers around here, and we have Mrs. Victoria Murray, Mrs. Geneva Shaw. Oh, a good five or six of us left, that's about all.
You were also the first woman to be elected state president of the Gold Star and War Parents of America.
Yes, well that's a mixed, interracial group; there are very few blacks in it anyway. And there was a few of us out at the Robert Gould Shaw House, who formed a chapter in the Shaw House, and I helped to form the chapter. We had a chapter from the Shaw House; that's where we were organized, right in the Robert Gould Shaw House.
And orea:;i
during...
During the war, just like they did. Only it was for parents, instead of mothers—father and mothers—so that made it a different kind of an organization, so after I worked with them for two or three years, they elected me their state president. And I was the first woman president they'd had. They had men ahead of that, two or three men. The first woman president.
And when was that, that was in the late fort ies, or early fifties?
Yes, must have been late forties. During the war; the war was over when I was elected.
I see. Is that organization still in existence?
Well, just the same as the War Mothers. Five or six might be living. I don't know. I don't hear from them.
So do you get together with that group any more?
No, we haven't met together in years. No.
You were the first recipient of the Sojourner Truth Award from the Negro Business and Professional Women of Boston and Vicinity.
I was their first recipient.
What was the date?
Well, I don't remember. But it's on my...you can get it off the plaque they gave me; it's right there. But...yes, you can look at it and put the date in. They give that award every year. That's a national award that they give all through their business women's clubs, to women they feel typical of the work of Sojourner Truth.﻿98
TLM: Would you say that you received that in the forties, fifties or sixties?
MAC: Well, I don't remember, but you can easily get that, because that's hanging right up there on the wall, the Sojourner Truth Award.
TLM: All right. "The recipient of the Leslie B. Cutler Award." What is the Leslie B. Cutler Award?
MAC: Yes, well, they set up a Leslie B. Cutler Award after Miss Leslie
Cutler, who was the first woman representative to the Massachusetts legislature, from out in Newton. Up to the state house and in Newton they set up the Leslie Cutler Award in her memory, and they chose me to receive it. They felt that I typified her in some ways...she was living...and they felt I was more like her than anybody else that they wanted to give it to, so I got the first one. She was a great legislator, a great civic worker. She was a great lady. I knew her very, very well, too.
TLM: You were also the first woman to deliver a sermon from the pulpit of the Ebenezer Baptist Church, for Woman's Day 1967.
MAC: They say I am. I don't believe that, but they say so.
TLM: Was this for a club, a group?
MAC: Yes, all the women, all the women's clubs chose me for the speaker, for their Woman's Day. That is when all the women's clubs come together in that one church.
TLM: It was other women's clubs too?
MAC: No, just the club women of that church. And they invite you to
bring other people, but it's their own project. They have it every year. My church has one every year too. Woman's Day is quite a popular thing in black churches.
TLM: Is it on the same day every year?
MAC: No, they pick out certain days. Some have it in the fall, some have it in the spring. They have them whenever they want to get together, but once a year they have Woman's Day and Men's Day, same thing.
TLM: In your particular church, when is it Woman's Day?
MAC: Well, we had ours, last time, in the spring. I don't know when they're going to have it this year. We'll probably have it in spring again.﻿99
TLM: On May 26, 1968, the Mayor of Newton, Monte Basbas, proclaimed, "this day Melnea Cass Day," when you delivered the sermon at the Myrtle Baptist Church for Woman's Day.
MAC: Yes, that was their Woman's Day.
TLM: "To assist in a building fund."
MAC: That was really a nice time.
TLM: Can you describe that a little?
MAC: It was quite a nice affair; the mayor declared it Melnea Cass Day because I was coming to Newton. I had a lot of friends out there who told him I was coming, and they wanted to, you know, advertise it some way, and they called it that, and then I just went to the church as usual and spoke to them on women's subjects, whatever I felt like; I don't remember what it was now. But what it was, they said it was all right. They were going to raise money.
TLM: Well, this was before women's lib. Did you talk about women's lib topics?
MAC: Well, I might have, because I believe in that anyway. But I might not have. But I might have just told them about what women are really doing and could be doing and what they have done. Women have done great things in this country to help make it progress, especially black women.
TLM: Well, what do you think about the women's liberation movement?
MAC: I think it's great. I think it's a wonderful thing. I think, particularly when it comes to work, I think fair wages should be given to women; if they can do the job as well as a man, they ought to get the same pay. I hate to think that they have to say, "A man will get this, but because you're a woman, you can't get it," if you're doing the work. But if you're not doing it, you shouldn't get it. I don't believe in that, no. But I think on the whole that women have gained a lot by that.
TLM: How about in the family, liberated family relationships?
MAC: Like what?
TLM: Liberated marriages and things like that.
MAC: Well, of course in the family, the women today...they can be freed from a lot of the laborious things in the home, that can be taken care of other ways, and I think they can have a little easier life and enjoy more privileges of living than they used to years ago.﻿100
MAC: (cont.) Women in my time, raising a family, had to just make time for things; they'd just do it anyway, if you wanted to. And so we always, some of us, did things anyway. But we couldn't let everything go in the home, because if you had children and all that, you didn't have all this assistance, electrical equipment. Labor was so hard on you; sometimes you were too tired to do a lot of things that you younger women can go now, and get through with what you got to do, and do anything you want. And they can go out to work, too, because they can get some good people to take care of their children. There's some good people taking care of children, and there's some that are not. So personally, I would like to see more of the women I know stay home and take care of their children. I believe in that. That's my own philosophy. I think there's nobody takes care of a child like the mother. You can have the separate, whatever you call it, mother's nursery schools, but when they get bigger they can go to a nursery school, when they get good sized, but when they're little, the mother ought to be with them all the time. Give them their first training and their first impressions.
TLM: And then after the kids grow up?
MAC: Well, they can put them out in the nursery schools with other kids, so they can learn, and can associate with other children and understand other children, and be with them. And that prepares them for the future. But the basic things you need to teach them, the mother has to really do that. Get them trained for a nursery school or a kindergarten, wherever you're going to send them to.
TLM: What about, oh, let's see, I'm just thinking about some other things in family relationships. What about marriage? And there's some questioning now about the nuclear family, and whether marriages are necessary, and liberated marriages and so on. What do you think about that? What about single mothers?
MAC: Well, of course, as far as single mothers go, I think sometimes
they're better off single, if they can't get along married. Just because it says you've got to get married, it's all right, but who are you going to marry, and what is the person like. And I think sometimes that it's... They just hate to go into it, and they have to come out of it so fast. But this, I agree with marriage. I think it should never be abolished. I think you ought to always first, if you possibly can, get married and then raise your children. But if you should happen to have a child and you're not married, that's not a terrible disgrace. Go ahead and raise the child up the best you can by yourself. You don't always need the man to help you raise the child. Some of them are married, and their husbands don't help them raise them. The mother has to do most everything. Man thinks he's out working, and he's the breadwinner, he's done his part and you got the children, you should raise them, you know? So I don't know how to solve that question with this modern business﻿101
MAC: (cont.) they're doing. I don't quite approve of it. Unless it's a dire necessity. I believe in marriage. Getting married and having a family. I still cling to that. I think if you get married and you find that you can't get along, separate. Nothing wrong with that.
TLM: I was just going to ask you what you thought about divorce.
MAC: I think sometimes it's much better to separate. If you can't get along together, try it out, have plenty of patience. If you find you can't get along, just go ahead and separate. Get your divorce, and maybe some other man will come along you like just as well, or can better assimilate yourself with. That's the way I think.
TLM: Well, what about also...not only marriage and divorce, but what about widowhood? You experienced that. When did your husband pass away?
MAC: Oh, it was, let's see, 1954, I think it is. '54, '64, '74, it was -idiaaost twenty, over twenty years. I get along fine as a widow, because I realized when my husband left, that he had done all he could do on this earth, and the Lord saw fit to take him, and there wasn't anything I could do about it. And I know I would like to have had him live longer, so he could be around with us, and enjoy the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren, because he loved the grandchildren and all so. If he could have just seen these greatgrandchildren, I don't know what he would have done. He'd have been so happy. Because he was a good father and a good husband, a good everything. And he wanted to live, I know, and retire. He was planning for it. Trying to get everything lined up so he could retire, and not have to worry about finances and like that. But he left right in the middle of it. So he died very suddenly. He had a heart attack.
TLM: Oh, he did? Was he still working?
MAC: Yes, getting ready to go to work that day.
TLM: Oh, I see.
MAC: But he had these...
TLM: He had no heart condition?
MAC: Yes, he had several little signs of it and the doctor gave him some medicine for it, but he knew he was subject to that little bit, but not quite as bad as this was. But what I was going to say was, he would... Since he's been gone, it hasn't been too hard for me to adjust my living alone, because I have so many things that take up my time and that I'm interested in. If I didn't have them, I think if I would have been a person who didn't have anything to do, I think I would miss him more. But see, by having things, activities﻿102
MAC: (cont.) to do, I have so many things to do that I don't have a chance to just brood over him going. I miss him a great deal, but I've got so now that I understand what it's all about. But at first, it was very hard to stay here. It was just him and I.
TLM: I see, then...
MAC: Everybody had gone.
TLM: Was your daughter living downstairs at that time?
MAC: Yes, yes.
TLM: And then, what did you do? Just keep going with your activities, or did you take some time off?
MAC: Well, I kept going right straight along. Well, I rested a little
bit between, because you have your business to take care of, your insurance, your house and all, your different business to take care of. Two or three good weeks of that, and getting yourself newly adjusted and all, and straightening out those things. Then after that I just went on to my meetings and things I belonged to. I didn't stop doing that. That don't make sense.
MAC: [Telephone rings] Hello. I'm here. How are you? Good. Yes,
pretty good. How are you making out? Yes, how'd your things turn out? Yes, that's good. Because that don't make sense. You know, I was going to call them, and tell them that if they're going to put cots up in that old place for those people, there's none of my people will come. Because that's like cattle. That's a disgrace. Yes. Yes. Well, they're not coming...who's coming? You? Who wants to come? I told you that, didn't I? Who's going to get up in the morning, as cold as it is, to come somewhere to get a little old breakfast? You can drink some coffee and make some toast, and get along, and you can get somebody to go to the store for you and bring you something. We're not that bad off. Oh, sure, they'll do an errand for you and bring you back enough for four or five days or a week. That's right. I think so too; just to make headlines, but I'm glad the people didn't come. I didn't think they would, dear. No, we don't have no people like that. Who wants to sleep in a gym aside of some old strange people? Pulling off your clothes and everything in front of everybody? Who's going to do that? That's crazy. There's nobody that bad off. They had the people at 280 Martin Luther King [Boulevard]. If I had called Kevin's? office, go and tell him, "Listen." I would tell him, "Listen, you all had those people without any heat for two or three days right in that housing project, and nobody went there to try to do nothing." I said, "So don't come here now getting people out of their houses
*
Kevin White﻿103
MAC: (cont.) to sleep In a gym." Old gym, all drab and cold. If it was a fire, now, that's different. I'd sleep anywhere in a fire. But I'm not going out of my house to sleep in any gym. McCarthy? Yes. Yes, do what you ask him. Ummm. No. Well, it won't be any. We meet Friday, and we're going to nip that in the bud. The advisory board, while I am talking...be sure we get coverage to ride down...
Mrs. Smith is sick, you know. Mrs. Smith's been in bed ever since our meeting. She's up a little yesterday. Had the virus. I called her yesterday but her granddaughter gave her the message. But she's been in bed, yes. Call and see how she is today. I haven't had time. I've been busy. But she had the virus, I guess. Who? Who is she? Diabetes? Oh, my. My, my, my. What hospital? Oh Deaconess, yes. Oh Lord, praise... Yes. Whatever's going to happen, right. Yes, well of course they put you in there right away, but that's all right; she'll come out tomorrow or the next day. Don't they? Well, they do that? They do that, they have to ...yes. Oh dear, well that's bad. Yes. Oh dear me. Isn't that sad? Yes. Well, we always do. Yes, we got to. Yes, of course, you can't blame him. It's pretty bad. Yes, sure. It's all he can do. If he needs to go home, let him go. Yes. He'd rather work, I should think. Just be free to go when he can. If he can run over there, let him go. Umm. Well? be sure to put Miss Tinsley down, and myself; I don't think Mrs. Smith should even try to go. And so just put her and I down for Friday, nine o'clock, to go to the advisory. Yes, we'll try to get to that. Yes. We generally go around nine. So we can be there on time. Because I have got to leave there and come up to a luncheon at Resthaven, got to get up there as fast as I can. They're having that at one, but I won't fool with that boy, unless he can really take me up there. But if he can take me when he comes, I'll have him take me right up there. Yes, to pick us up. He'll pick us up about twelve, because he can't stand out there in the street, you know, so have him be, twelve o'clock or I'll come down by twelve-fifteen. To go home. Yes, and I can tell somebody to take it over, I have to go. Yes, twelve-fifteen I'll come out in the street. Yes. And tell him to wait, tell him don't go. Just stand there, because I'll be right down, because he can't stand long, you know. And tell him if he gets scared, drive right in there. They won't say nothing to him. Tell him to tell the policeman he's going to pick up some seniors. And then Miss Tinsley can come on out too and go. So she can get home, and then he can take me to Resthaven. So I'll get there quicker that way. Yes, fine. Okay. I'm glad. That's good. Oh sure. No excitement, huh? Well, I'm glad. Well, they come in spurts. Then after that it's nothing. Okay. Ummm. Ummm.
TLM: Your phone conversations are so interesting from this end that I taped a little bit.
TLM: Okay, I took a little time to put in chronological order some of your other awards and activities.﻿104
MAC: Some of those things are past, so it's not necessary to even talk about them.
TLM: Well, the 1966 Melnea Cass Day proclaimed by the former mayor of Boston.
MAC: Well, that was by John Collins. That was quite a nice affair from the citizens of Boston; paid a tribute to me for my activities over the years. Wasn't any special thing, but it was just to say thank you for all the things you've done over the years for every...for many people. It was quite nice, at the Hotel Bradford. I don't know how many people they had. I guess a couple of thousand or so, maybe more, and it was really a beautiful affair, and that's the book that you saw there that they presented me. You were looking at the memory book with letters from all over, everywhere, all over the state of Massachusetts, and organizations, and all places that sent the letters to me, and they put it in the book.
TLM: Well, also in 1968, another one of your awards was the dedication of the M.D.C.* swimming pool-skating rink complex named for "Roxbury's First Lady."
MAC: Yes, that was quite a great thing. I guess you've seen it, haven't you? Passed by it? That was quite a great honor, because that was the first pool or M.D.C. facility named for a living person. And they had to pass legislation up in the legislature, House and Senate in Massachusetts, to make that a possibility, and they said it was unanimous. I heard it was unanimous. Frank Holgate, our representative, who's deceased now, and then Mike Haynes and Royal Boiling were the black representatives up there at the time, and they brought me a copy, I have it here, a copy of that legislation. That's a great honor and that was really the culmination of many years of effort on my part, to get a facility in this part, along with other mothers who...we worked hard, and go up to the hearings and ask for it and never accomplish, but when we got these three black ones in there, they watched for the money and got it appropriated for this area. So that's why we have it.
TLM: Because of the black legislators.
MAC: Yes, that's right. Because they were there, and saw the money, and knew it could be done, and they did it.
TLM: Well, in 1970 then you received an award for the "outstanding lay contribution to social welfare" by the Eastern Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers.
MAC: Yes, that was a surprise. I didn't know anything about that, and they presented me with that.
TLM: Who initiated that, do you know?
* Metropolitan District Commission.﻿105
MAC: Well, I think the social workers. It was Hubie Jones, and some
more of them who were social workers in that, picked me. I don't remember all of them, but most of the social workers around here. I guess my daughter's one of them and all of them belong to that social workers association, Rheable Edwards, a whole lot of them. They give one every year, I understand. So they chose me for that year.
TLM: Okay. The Citizenship Training Group, Incorporated, affiliated with the Boston Juvenile Court, conferred upon Dr. Melnea Cass the Honorable John Forbes Perkins Award For Distinguished Service in 1973.
MAC: I was chosen by...I'm a member of that board of directors, really. And that is a group that worked under the juvenile court for the young boys and girls who are on probation, and they are sent up here to the various courts around here. And we have a center in
the Y for girls, and then we have one for the boys up here at the Y, but the Young Women's Christian Association has the one for the girls. You can have this pamphlet, that's it. And then the one for boys is at the Boy's Club and the Y.
TLM: You're still on the board?
MAC: I'm still on the board for that. I got the award that year.
TLM: Okay, prior to receiving this award you had been a recipient of
two honorary doctorate degrees in humanities, one from Northeastern and one from Simmons College.
MAC: That's right. I got one from Northeastern, and then the next year I got one...a couple of years later, I got one from Simmons.
TLM: In what years were those, do you remember? In the seventies, or in the sixties?
MAC: I think they're all in the sixties. But they're there; we can get the dates. I didn't bring them in.
TLM: All right. And then in May 1974 you were named the 1974 Mother of Massachusetts by American Mothers' Committee, Incorporated.
MAC: That's right. That was quite an honor, too. And they, Massachusetts State Federation of Women's Clubs, recommended me for that award. And I thought that was quite a great thing.
TLM: And what were some of the activities that went on around your receiving this award?﻿106
MAC: Well, of course, we went to New York to the Waldorf Astoria for four or five days for all kind of activities that were planned for the recipients who came from all over the United States. And they had programs planned for every day with art exhibits; people put their paintings, and so forth. Then they had speakers and workshops. They had all sorts of things. And then during that time, the people, you appeared before the committee, and told what your activities were and so forth, and those were the judges and so forth. They marked their tallies, and then they announced who the winner was going to be at this luncheon that we all went to.
TLM: This was in New York?
MAC: Yes, at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, you see. Right there. That's where they invited you to come. So I went there and stayed for the whole time. My family all came up for the luncheon. We had quite a nice time.
TLM: To New York for that? Oh.
MAC: Yes, all of them, two or three friends, some of the Women's
Service Club. Had about twenty or more people there, twenty. Well, I guess maybe thirty.
TLM: Friends who went to...
MAC: Who came over for that.
TLM: Who drove down, or did everyone take a train together?
MAC: Well, some drove down, some came on the bus. They came different ways.
MAC: [The honorary degree] ...They have it outdoors, you know, and I
never will forget it. It was so beautiful. Such a lovely ceremony. And then afterwards they had this beautiful luncheon for us, and all my guests and my family were there, and it was really something to remember. And the night before, the Sunday before that, they had a dinner at the Parker House, at which time they had all the recipients there. And they told something about each one, and those who were going to receive the degrees the next day. That was quite a nice affair. That's the only one that did that, of those I got. They had us all there the night before, on Sunday night and the graduation was Monday.
TLM: A banquet?
MAC: Yes, a beautiful affair.﻿107
TLM: I understand that you also have received community service awards
from the NAACP, Freedom House, ABCD, Massachusetts State Federation of Women's Clubs, Achievement Award in Cultural and Human Relations from the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs; a citation from the Conference of Christians and Jews for "outstanding service to the ideals of brotherhood." Are these some of the awards that are on your walls?
MAC: Yes, most all of them are there.
TLM: I'd like to ask you a few more questions before we move on to the final phase of our interview, which will be looking at your photographs and awards. I want to ask you some questions about your hobbies, and about your leisure time.
MAC: Well, I have very little leisure time, I'm sorry to say. I ought to have more leisure time than I have. But when I have any, I like to read, and I put things aside to read. And when I get leisure time, I read them.
TLM: What sorts of things?
MAC: I like books, and I like literature that comes out about certain things that pertain to things that I'm doing or things going on. And I always like to read them, and I always take them in case... And I stay up on the black news, because I have Ebony and Jet, and I have other periodicals from time to time. And I like to keep up with the news that's going on, and read about it, as well as... because the TV's all right, but there's nothing like reading about these things. And so I do like to read a great deal, and I don't do too much handcraft or anything. That doesn't appeal to me at all. Even when I was in the Pansy Embroidery Club, I didn't do very much of it. They used to say, "You're not a good member, because you're not making anything." I said, "Well, you make something for me. That will be all right." But I did a lot of other things to help that some of them couldn't do. So they always felt that I was a very valuable member, because somebody had to do everything, you know.
TLM: Well, when everyone else was sewing, were you chatting?
MAC: No, I would always... sometimes try to do something, but most of
the time they had me doing secretarial work, or they had me doing something else. You know, they always had something for me to do. But my other hobbies I like, the main hobby I like is to be involved with all sorts of things throughout the community, and keep alert on them and be a part of them. It's my activities that I really give more time to than anything else.
TLM: So in terms of your reading, what kinds of things do you read? You mentioned Ebony and Jet. What newspapers do you read?﻿108
MAC: Well, I like our daily paper that we have. I like the New York paper, the Times; we get those, I think they're pretty inclusive. And I like some magazines like Ladies' Home Journal and yes, I like that, and I like Time magazine and quite a number of those. I can't afford to take Time magazine and all those things, but my daughter does, and I always get them when I have a chance to read them. She always sends them to me. Yes, she...can better afford it than I can. The Christian Science Monitor.
TLM: How about television, you mentioned... Oh, do you pick that up or...
MAC: I subscribe to it. And of course the black weeklies, like, as I told you, The Banner that comes out, and Afro-American...
TLM: You subscribe?
MAC: Yes. I take it by the year. And the Afro-American, I take that one. I have those papers and Jet.
TLM: Any other papers or magazines you subscribe to?
MAC: No, I don't subscribe to any now, but I used to, because it costs
too much. But I do have them from time to time; I pick them up and read them. And I get a lot of literature in the mail pertaining to all sorts of subjects, somebody sending me all the time, which makes it very interesting. Some pamphlets, things of that kind.
TLM: You mentioned television. Do you watch very much TV?
TLM: Not very much. Since the storm's up...when I'm shut in, I do. But I always try to get the news and hear that. I don't follow any stories or anything like that. They don't appeal to me very much.
TLM: Do you have any favorite television programs?
MAC: Well, at the present time I like "The Jeffersons," if I can catch
them, and I like the one they call "Happy Days," and I like—what's the other one that X... X very seldom get them, but I like the talk programs, when I can hear them, like Jerry Williams. And used to listen to...
TLM: Oh, you listen to the radio talk programs? I noticed when I came in that you had the radio news on. Do you listen to that very much?
MAC: Well, when I've been home like this and working in here, it's in my bedroom, as a rule. I brought it in here, so I could hear the news and other things that's happening right along, because you can't stop and go and look at TV, if you're doing something else.
TLM: So you listen to the news and the talk shows?﻿109
MAC: I generally hear the news on TV, though, every night, if I'm home. Straight through.
TLM: How about sports?
MAC: I'm not too interested in sports. I think it's good, and if it happens to come on while I have it on, like a basketball game, I might look a little while, but I'm not a fan of basketball or baseball.
TLM: Have you ever spent much time at the movies?
MAC: Well, I used to; years ago I used to go to the movies a great
deal. My husband and I, we used to often go to movies; you know, if there was a nice play or anything that we liked, we'd try to go to it. But I'm not a person that just goes to the movies regular, have to go, I don't do that. Not any more. When I was younger I did. I went to plenty of them. I liked it, you know, and I always liked to go to a good show, a musical show. That's what I always went to more or less. Followed those, you know. See, years ago they had so many good ones. Ziegfeld Follies and...
TLM: And you would go?
MAC: Oh yes, all of those.
TLM: In Boston?
MAC: Oh yes, oh yes, I used to go, my husband and I, and even before I
was married, they had that, those... Shuffle Along, the black show and all those things. Of course, all those movies like Gone With the Wind, and all tho se kinds of movies that came out during my day, we went to see all of those.
TLM: Oh, you did? This is while you were quite young?
MAC: No, when they came along. They came along since I've been married. Gone With the Wind, and all of those came along since I've been married. Of course, when I was going around, a lot of us would get together and go to the shows; you know, they had so many good shows here years ago, and they were so reasonable in price. But now these shows, they don't appeal to you; it's very seldom you see a real good show that you'd like to see.
TLM: Do you go very often now to the theater?
MAC: Well, once in a while. I didn't see this Brown Sugar, I missed that.
TLM: Bubbling Brown Sugar?﻿110
MAC: But I really was trying to get to that, and I put it off too long;
I didn't get to see that. But I saw Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope. I saw that. I see most any that appeals to me; I can go if I want to.
TLM: You just go on your own?
MAC: No, my daughter generally goes, or my son-in-law, two or three of us get together and go, friends that I know, we go together. Make up a group and go.
TLM: How about music? Did you go out much to hear music?
MAC: Oh, I love music. Yes, I used to go to... Well, of course, we used to have concerts, dear; we presented more people in musical concerts than you can shake a stick at. Most every...
TLM: What kind of music?
MAC: ...prominent black artists, Leontyne Price, and oh, all of those, we presented them in concert here in Boston. And we all go to those. Some group or another presents them. Women's Service Club presented quite a few of them. And of course we sell the tickets and make money. Symphony Hall and different places. Now that really is something, that I have been to many, many concerts: Roland Hayes, especially when he was starting out, and all of them who've come through here in Boston, artists, we really put them on, you know, in a concert, helped them. They helped us and we helped them. Duke Ellington, all of those.
TLM: Oh, I was going to say, more classical or jazz?
MAC: Oh yes, Duke Ellington and Count Basie, and all of them. I've been right at the concerts with them. I remember, what's the fellow that died? Piano player. He died just a little while ago.
TLM: Erroll Garner?
MAC: Erroll Garner, I've been to his presentations and all of those. We followed them; they'd come to town, I'd more or less like to see them. Because Duke Ellington, I knew him very well, and I met Mercer, his son, and feel very close to them in a way, because he started out as a young fellow, Duke Ellington, right here in Boston, when I was not married, just going to dances and he used to... He came to Boston.
TLM: So you knew who he was then?
MAC: Oh yes, I knew him very well, Duke Ellington. And I met his son, too, when I was out in Chicago, yes. No, Detroit.﻿Ill
TLM: Were you there on a convention?
MAC: No, I was there on a visit--- I just had been to the convention,
and then came to Detroit to visit a friend, and we went in. He was playing at some place, and we went in, and she knew him and took me up and introduced me, and I told him how I knew his father and all of them...he was so pleased. Of course, he probably doesn't remember that, but I'd tell him that anyway.
TLM: Well, what about dances and parties? You mentioned that Duke Ellington played...
MAC: Well, he played for many dances and parties that I went to.
Dances. He started out here, as I said, in Boston, just a young fellow, with dances, and we went to those. Whenever he came, we all went.
TLM: So the organizations that you belonged to and also were a leader of, had concerts and so on. Also dances?
MAC: Oh yes, it didn't matter. The dances were...there's no bar against giving a dance. You give whatever draws most money so you can make money. You don't even have to dance, if you don't want to, but the point is to promote it so that you could make money from it that's the point. Sure, the Robert Gould Shaw House, that I belonged to, right now, I'm still on the board of it, you know. We're planning to really try to get, if we can, a first night with one of these stars when they come to Boston. We thought we'd have one with Diana Ross, just next week, but we didn't get there early enough. So we're trying to watch to get one—the first nights for that—and that will be something that might make money for our settlement.
TLM: How about nightclubs? Did you and your husband go to nightclubs?
MAC: Once in a great while, yes. Once in a great while, we'd go to a nice nightclub, and I've been to many of them, many of them, yes. Nothing wrong with them. I danced. I used to be a good dancer when I was young. Of course I can't dance now, I don't try, because I get dizzy, but I always was a dancer. I would love to dance.
TLM: What's your favorite dance?
MAC: Well, I used to like the two-step. You don't know nothing about
that. I liked the waltz. And they had, in my day, what they called the foxtrot. I liked that. Oh yes, I was a dancer. I loved dancing. I could waltz. Sometimes they used to say I ought to try for prize waltz because I could waltz so good. But I never did. But I loved to waltz. It's the prettiest dance there is.
TLM: It is a beautiful dance. What other hobbies did you have?﻿112
MAC: Well, I don't know what you call hobbies, what do you mean hobbles? Things you like to do? Well, I liked to go on picnics and I liked to go out sightseeing. My daughter and all of us, my grandchildren, we'd go off on picnics sometimes in summer, take the car and go out places. I like that. I think things like that are nice, and I like to take them, and just go out in the country and spread out and have lunch.
TLM: To what places? What locations?
MAC: Well, we go up to some of the state parks. My daughter has quite a number in mind. We ride up into New Hampshire, one or two state parks, places like that. We go down to the Cape. We have some friends on the Cape. We can go to the Cape any time and visit.
TLM: This is Marianne?
MAC: Well, some of ay friends are there, older women like me that have homes there.
TLM: How about travel? You've mentioned that you've gone to conferences and conventions, and have you traveled outside of the country?
MAC: No, I've never been outside.
TLM: But you've been all over the country?
MAC: All over the country. It's now many places. Especially with the conventions of National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, because they meet in a different area every two years. So you go all over the country with them.
TLM: And do you try to make it to most of the conventions?
MAC: Well, I haven't missed many in the last twenty, twenty-five years. No, I haven't missed them. I don't expect to miss them; unless I'm sick or something, I'm going. I believe in it, and I belong to it, and I love it, and I'm going to go.
TLM: When you travel do you ordinarily, as you told me, do you ordinarily travel by bus or by train?
MAC: By train.
TLM: All over the country?
MAC: Oh yes, oh yes. We went from here to California for the convention. The Massachusetts State Union of Women's Clubs chartered two buses and we all went together on it, just like a tour. And we stopped every night in a motel, it was all scheduled. And we'd get out, and the driver would take us sightseeing. And at night, we'd get﻿113
MAC: (cont.) there before dark, we stopped, take us out and show us
things even at night. And going across the country, he told us, he's a person who's trained to tell you everything you're passing through. Every place we went to of interest, we went to Boys Town, we went to many interesting places. Yes, we went to the Mormons' chapel there in Utah. Yes, we went there and had a sightseeing trip there and went in, looked around, oh yes.
TLM: So when you go to new cities you ordinarily stop, and you go on a sightseeing bus.
MAC: Oh no, we go on our own buses. We charter these buses. And then we get in, and we have our own driver, and he knows about the
terrain we're going through, and as he goes through he stops___
We don't stop all the time. Now you're passing so-and-so, this is so-and-so. So you learn where you are, you see where you are. When we got to the Salt Lake, we got out at the Salt Lake and looked "iround, oh yes, and he described it to us, what it was, and all that sort of thing. That's what we had him for. That's the kind of tour we ask for with the companies, that's what we want.
TLM: When you go to a new town or new city to a conference, do you often stay in the hotels or with friends?
MAC: We stay in the hotels, always. Our convention is in the best hotels in the city. When we went to Atlanta, we stayed in the Hyatt Regency, the best hotel in Atlanta, and we had two hundred...
TLM: Was that recently?
MAC: Just two years ago. We had two hundred-and-some rooms in there, and we had that convention all scheduled way ahead, so we had the best of everything. And if you don't want to stay in a hotel, and you want to live cheaper, it's up to you. You can make your own reservations. There are some people who have friends; they go live with them, and there's some who want to go to, perhaps, the Y or something cheaper, that's up to them. But as a rule, we all go in the hotel because the meeting is in the hotel, all the functions are in the hotel, so you just go up to your room and come down to the function. Why do you want to run all over the city with a cab, when you can stay right there? Of course, I couldn't do it now anyway, but I never did. I always made my reservation right there. And you have everything there at your hand, just what you want, you know. You only do it every two years so you get ready for it. It's expensive but you do it.
TLM: May I ask you, thinking back on all of your activities, your travel, your leadership positions, what would you say are the few most significant or important achievements in your life?﻿114
MAC: Well, I don't know whether I could say which was the most important, because I hate to draw a line with anything that I feel I have done, but one of the achievements, I think, is at the Women's Service Club, when we were able to get the programs through to help all these disadvantaged women. So many black women had done domestic work, and they hadn't b een able to be recognized with dignity, and we brought that about. We got legislation passed to raise the benefits for them, to give them an equal wage with everybody. Even the federal government is passing laws now, that they are recognized under the workmen's compensation, and all the benefits. We pushed for that on the national level. And on that I think that's good, because I did that work myself, and I just lived to see the day that you'd be dignified in it, and that you also get the same wages that the working people get, the minimum wage. I think it's the best achievement yet that I have taken part in, because it is helping so many people, and it will continue to help so many people as long as those kind of people are around. I think that's the best achievement.
The NAACP is the next one, because I feel that in the NAACP I have added my strength to the whole civil rights movement. That helps all the people, black and white people as well, all over the nation, because we worked together for the liberation of all people. We're not just saying black, but black were the most depressed and deprived, so therefore you feel that when you work with the NAACP, what you do covers a whole lot of ground, see. It isn't a small little thing like a social club. There's a difference, you know. Those are national groups.
National Association of Colored Women, they stretch out all over the country and down in Hawaii. They're helping women, to lift them up, their motto is "Lifting as we climb." It's a beautiful motto. And it helps all women to bring them up, the women who no matter whether they're educated or uneducated, to make them understand that they are a part of the going nation, every part of it, take part in everything in it, get prepared to do it. I think that's a wonderful organization too.
TLM: Thank you. I have two more questions that are sensitive questions. One of them has to do with, well, we talked a little bit about marriage and some of your opinions about women's liberation and so on, and you expressed your opinion about women who are raising children on their own. What about the issue of illegitimacy?
MAC: Well, dear, that's going to be going on as long as there are women and men in the world, because people will have sex together, and some of them don't intend to get married or anything else. And of course the poor little child is born out of it and has to be taken care of. There's nothing wrong, it's just something that happens to people, and it's just a part of life that if you have an﻿115
MAC: (cont.) Illegitimate child, you have to take care of it. And the mothers, if they can't take care of it, the state takes care of it today. And I think they should. No child brings itself here. And the illegitimate child needs to be taken care of just the same as a mother and a father's child. It's the child, you know, it's not the mother that you're taking care of. You're taking care of the child.
TLM: What about another issue, the issue of abortion?
MAC: Well, I think that should be left to a person's discretion. If
that person wants to have an abortion, there's nothing wrong about it if you don't wait too long, till there's life moving around in you, then you murder. But if you take care of a fetus that's inside, a little egg or something, get it out of you quickly, there's nothing wrong about that. People have been doing that for years. And they did it all kind of crooked ways and everything. Now it's become so it's legalized in some places, and I think it's right. Because it's going to happen. It has happened. I know a lot of women died from abortions in my day, went out and had them done, and terrible things happened to them.
TLM: Was that anything that was ever discussed at all?
MAC: Yes, they discussed it. A lot of us discussed it. A person died and the doctors would get around, the authorities, and make them tell who performed the abortion, and sometimes the poor little doctor loses his license and everything. All kinds of crooked things were done because people were looking for help, and they couldn't get it legally, so they got it however they could. So I think abortions are right. If you want it, you should have it, and I don't think anybody should be deprived of anything they want in this place. As long as it's done right. Now if it's done right under proper circumstances, in a hospital or a clinic, what's wrong about it if I want it done? That's me, it's myself. Nobody has the right to tell me I can't do it. Then if they tell me I can't do it, I'll go find somewhere where I can do it which is not legalized and which might kill me. You see? So I don't see anything wrong about abortions.
TLM: Okay. I'm going to bring up another issue which is a totally
different issue, but which is also a very sensitive one, it seems to me. And I'm wondering about the whole issue, which is somewhat important for blacks, and that is the issue of skin color—that is, who's light and who's dark; what kind of impact that has on how you see yourself, how you relate to other people and vice versa, and to life. Now can you give me your opinion about that?
MAC: Well, as far as skin color amongst blacks themselves, if that's what you want... Years ago, right after slavery, there was a... The way my family explained it to me, and my aunt, mostly, who raised me up and who really led me after my mother died, said that﻿116
MAC: (cont.) years ago, that in slavery, they had the field hands—of course if you saw "Roots," you know that—and they had the house hands. And the house hands sometimes were children begotten by the masters and the slaves, sons and all that business, and they were "better" than the field hands. The field hands were the old, thrown-together Africans who had to fetch for themselves any kind of way they could, and they couldn't come in the big house at all. They stayed in those shanties. Well, there became a division between them then, there were the field hands and the house hands were better than each other, you had competition. When freedom came, that stayed with them. They felt distinguished from the others, and most of them were fair-skinned and some of them were almost white because they were born from white people. As long as the slavery lasted, the whiter they got because the children became very light complexioned, and then they mixed up with white people, and they became lighter and lighter. And you had many shades of black people. And between them was this superiority of being a nouse person and a field person. So there you had this color business between themselves. They didn't even know what they were doing but they... It had been drawn up for them and given to them, and so that is why it followed for a long time, oh, long after slavery, that it was always felt that a light-skinned Negro was better than a black one, and sometimes white people made that distinction too. They'd hire a light-skinned one and let the black one go. So that's one reason why we had that kind of feeling between us, that was a part of our heritage from slavery. That's where it came from.
TLM: Well, tell me something, how has any of this had any kind of impact on your life?
MAC: Oh, not on me, because I wouldn't... No... See, I wasn't raised
up with that, that had all gone ahead, gone when I became conscious of what I was and what's going on. My family, my mother and all, my mother was very black and my father was very fair, so I wouldn't have any of that kind of complex in my house, in my living. I didn't know anything about that except that they told us about it. And we didn't have that, but very few families that I knew had that sort of complex. It was going on amongst certain classes of blacks who probably had more education, and who felt they were superior ones, when everybody couldn't get it; but now everybody can get every education they want, and this black power came in and told them all they were black alike, so what difference did it make? So I think that helped to clear the air, a lot of people thought they were a little superior on account of skin color. They put the skin color right down.
TLM: What about in your own family, your two sisters and you? Were you different colors?﻿117
MAC: No, very little, we were about...around the same brown skin. Like I am. Yes, my youngest sister, the one that died, she was a little fairer than I am, and then— I mean, that just died. And the other one in my family who was very white was my father. And my father didn't have any complex and he didn't have anything like that.
TLM: Your father was mixed?
MAC: My father was mixed, yes. He was very fair. He looked just like a white person. But all my family, everyone was very conscious of being a Negro and very proud of it; we were taught to be very proud that we were Negroes, and we knew we were poor, but that didn't amount to anything. We were taught to be very proud and very self-respecting and very progressive and very dignified in every way.
TLM: How about your husband and his family?
MAC: Well, my husband... that's my mother-in-law that I'm telling you
about. Oh yes, my husband's family were just like mine, my family. In fact, his family was more progressive socially than my family, because his mother was a civic leader here in Boston, everybody knows her that's living now, older people. Her name is famous, Rosa Brown. And that's it. They were prominent as far as that, not rich, but just working amongst the community and helping the people, you know. You really have a lot there to be proud of. His mother was darker than I am, much darker. His mother. And he was kind of fair, because I guess his father was a light-skinned Negro from what he looked like. He didn't even remember his father, hardly. He died when he was little. So he didn't hardly know his father. And his stepfather, Mr. Brown, was a very, very dark man. See, that's the kind of family we were. All of us were very proud of what we were. And when I went to that family, I found they were just as proud as we were, if not more, of what they were. That makes a difference.
TLM: Okay!
MAC: Now, you didn't say anything about my eightieth birthday. I didn't tell you about it, the day that they had the naming of the Y, Janet Langhart, you know, who's with Channel 5, Janet... that's the party, the eightieth birthday.
TLM: Well, what I wanted to do is to move into talking about your pictures.
[Mrs. Cass and Tahi Mottl begin to look at photographs in a large scrap-
book on the dining room table.]
MAC: Well, that was the eightieth birthday party that Janet Langhart was responsible for, on my eightieth birthday. She was really the person who got this birthday party together, and they had over two﻿118
MAC: (cont.) hundred people there to pay a tribute to me, on my
eightieth birthday. And that was given down at the Copley Plaza Hotel and initiated by Janet Langhart and her friends.
TLM: And this is the Sunday Herald Advertiser, June 20, 1976. That was your eightieth birthday, in the Bicentennial year. Why don't we go through some of these, they're not all in order, but we can just have fun with some of them anyway.
MAC: That's just a little NAACP thing I went to. This is the one for the State Mother, you already had it. The "Mother of the Year."
TLM: And this was April 18, 1974, the Globe, Thursday.
MAC: Those are other ladies who were runners-up, the Young Mother, and then she was the State Mother, and this one here was Young Mother. They had all that from each state.
TLM: What else do we have here? That's a lovely picture of you.
MAC: I think you got more over there, you want to look at...and then these.
TLM: Okay. What was this?
MAC: That was Mother of the Year, in "New York at the hotel, at the
banquet, Waldorf Astoria. And this one, you know, was a procession going up to get my award.
TLM: May 1975, Boston College.
MAC: And this is just a picture in the gown that some of the girls...
TLM: From Boston College?
MAC: No, that was the first one, Northeastern. And this is a picture... I wrote that, that doesn't have anything to do with it. And this one is Speaker of the House McCormack, and this is his nephew McCormack, and this is Reverend...from Saint Cyprian's. We were all at a reception and they took us all together. Reverend Wright, Nathan Wright.
TLM: I wonder when this was taken.
MAC: Oh that's been about, [1] guess about ten years ago. And this is [Governor Francis] Sargent signing for the Women's Service Club, making it a special day that we were having our anniversary, our birthday—I forget which one it was now.
TLM: The Women's Service Club. Can you identify some of the other women in the picture?﻿119
MAC: Yes, that's Cleo Hoffman, she's a vice-president. Burleigh
Chisholm, she's one of the charter members. That's Katie Stewart, she's an old-time member. Annie Johnson. Frances Moore. Edith West. Hazel Hughes. Hazel McCarthy. Myrtle Mitchell. And Alice Morris. Louise Morris and Sargent. It was our birthday, I forget which one it was. And this is Governor Volpe and he was signing the...
TIM: In Governor Volpe's office?
MAC: Yes, and he was signing, for the pool, to make it...
TLM: Oh, the Melnea Cass Pool.
MAC: Yes, and this is Northeastern, getting... And this is Peter
Princi who was attorney then. He's a magistrate now in the court here.
TLM: And what role did he play?
MAC: He was the one who recommended me for the award to the board, and also was my escort, and helped to put on my regalia. As you can see. And that's Reverend Knowles. He's the Knowles that's president of Northeastern University. This is down to the inauguration when Ed Brooke, his first swearing in at Washington, when he first was elected senator. And that's Mrs. Cass, Mrs. Moore, and that's Remigia, his wife. Now this is when I got a chair, when I was Mother of the Year, that's a Harvard...
TLM: From the Harvard University Gazette, May 24, 1974.
MAC: ...and they sent me a chair, and Mr. Leonard presented it to me for Mother of the Year. That day the NAACP gave me a beautiful salute. That was a beautiful party they gave me. As going away for Mother of the Year. And they gave me all the money I needed for my trip. That should go into my history.
TLM: Trip to New York?
MAC: Yes. The NAACP Special Committee. So he brought the chair there from Harvard. They wanted to recognize the day.
TLM: And do you have that chair?
MAC: That chair's in the living room. That one. And this is one that broke up the salute at...
TLM: A "community salute."
MAC: That's it.﻿120
TLM: And what's the date on this? This is June 10, 1966, the New
Boston Citizen, Boston's Integrated Newspaper and this is of the Hotel Bradford salute? Club women from all over. And Collins, Ed Brooke...
MAC: He was mayor. That's my whole family there.
TLM: May 22, 1966.
MAC: That's my family at that time, that's how they looked. My family. That's the photograph that's in the other room.
TLM: It's a drawing.
MAC: Yes, it's a painting. It's in the other room on the wall. And
this is the salute out there. Vernon was the chairman, and that's my son-in-law and I getting ready to go in.
TLM: This is the salute?
MAC: Yes, for the NAACP for the Mother of the Year. They gave me a
beautiful party, and that you saw before in the big picture. You saw that one. I don't know what this picture is. Something for Kennedy, voting for Kennedy.
TLM: You were a Kennedy supporter?
MAC: Yes, I always will be. I love them, all the Kennedys. I'm not a Democrat, but I do.
TLM: Are you a Republican?
MAC: Yes. Now this is...
TLM: How long have you been a Republican?
MAC: All my life. Not changing.	But I just vote for whoever I want to.
Anybody I want to vote for,	I vote for. Now this was just, a piece
was put in the paper by the	Christian Science Monitor. I don't
know really what it relates	to except an exemplary life.
TLM: This was on July 19, 1976. So this is during the Bicentennial.
MAC: And that had to do with that. And this is the same thing...
TLM: This is in the Boston Citizen.
MAC: And that's the story, the community salute.
TLM: I see. This is again the Hotel Bradford, Boston, with Attorney General Edward Brooke, keynote speaker.﻿121
MAC: Now these are almost the same things you have there.
TLM: Oh, this is at Northeastern.
MAC: Yes, it tells the different things that I got.
TLM: From the newspaper about the Northeastern honorary degree.
MAC: And this is about the...we got Kevin White to really...
TLM: From the Boston Herald, June 13, 1971.
MAC: ...and we wanted him to launch the drive in the South End to get
the new Harriet Tubman House, and we launched a buy—a—brick campaign, and Mrs. LeSueur was the president. She was there and she was honorary cochairman. All of us were, Dorothy Scott, Cass, and we were cochairmen to launch this drive to sell bricks. So we could make money. We had 350,000 and we needed 100,000 more.
And that was just before the christening, before the opening of it, the pool.
TLM: The Melnea A. Cass Swimming Pool and Skating Rink, photograph.
MAC: That's Governor Volpe, and that's my granddaughter, that's Kim, and this little boy, the two unveiled it. They pulled the string so we could have colored and white together using that pool. That's what we wanted. And that's Royal Boiling.
TLM: It was dedicated June 19, 1968.
MAC: And this was the same thing you just saw, Mother of the Year. This is my family, which you just saw.
TLM: When was this taken?
MAC: That was taken for...
TLM: World War II.
MAC: ...just before he left, a couple of days before he went away.
TLM: "Taken of my son."
MAC: That's him, that's my husband, that's me. That's Marianne, thatf's Melanie. That's my whole family. And this is the one we took up in the park when we were trying to get...
TLM: And this is about 1940, "Washington Park Group Organized."﻿122
MAC: ...I'm not sure what... For neighborhood improvement.
TLM: Tell me, who's in this picture?
MAC: Well, all these people. That's Mary Rose Randolph and that's Hazel Brothers and that's Nan Trapp and that's—I can't think of her name, so long ago—and this is Mrs. Jackson and this is Mrs. Ryder and myself. Now this girl here, I can't remember her name, or this one. But that was when we had a skirmish up here and a rabbi was killed. So then we decided we're going to get out and really work to make this city give us lights up in that park, and we did. This is Boston College from last year.
TLM: I see. The Boston College honorary degree. Beautiful.
MAC: And you had this one, Mother of the Year. Women '76. He was signing the decree to make it a day for...
TLM: Governor Dukakis... And this is your baby picture. We didn't see this. Do you know when this was taken? How old were you?
MAC: I guess I must have been about, I imagine I must have been about nine or ten months. I guess that was about that. That's just one the Globe took when they were here. This is with Cardinal Medeiros at some place, I don't even remember where it...
TLM: Is there a date on it?
MAC: No, taken by the Globe. This was when I nominated Ed Brooke to run
his second term. We were endorsing him here at the Hynes Auditorium.
TLM: Hynes Auditorium? Was this the Republican convention or...
MAC: No, it was the senior citizens, that we did. And this is Mother of the Year, that's saying my little piece.
TLM: This was April 19, 1974.
MAC: That's when I was speaking after I was chosen.
TLM: Another Globe photograph?
MAC: Those are all they took for that book they they put in the paper.
All these...for the book, for the piece in the paper. And of course this is the pool.
TLM: This one was taken on June 19, 1968, with beautiful flowers...
MAC: The pool, the day of the dedication. And this, I don't remember
where this was, so I can't... That's a shame. This is when I got my award, that's the"Massachusetts Mother of the Year." That's﻿123
MAC: (cont.) when the citizenship award was given to me. This is my 75th birthday, and my children gave me a party, and that's the
C 3.1c 6 • • •
TLM: Where was this?
MAC: At my daughter's house. And this... Melanie and that's Marianne. And this is, we gave Mrs. [Mary] Peabody a citation when she came back from going down in jail, for helping Martin Luther King.
TLM: I see. So this one was taken sometime during the 1960s.
MAC: Must have been.
TLM: She was in the freedom rides?
MAC: Yes, then we just recognized her at some little affair we had. And
this is Mike Waynes and myself at a parade, the Elks. The Reverend Mike Haynes and my neighbor next door, Harry, can't think of what his last name is right now. I'll think in a minute. That's Jesse Jackson and myself, at Elma Lewis's place.
TLM: And how many years ago was this one taken?
MAC: I don't remember. Hasn't been too long he was here. And this is the same thing from the governor, only he wrote on that one.
TLM: Governor Sargent.
MAC: And this is Volpe and I at the [pool] dedication. This is Ruth
Batson giving me the memory book at my banquet. And this, I don't remember when this was, so I can't help you out. It's been a long time. That's Herbert Tucker, who's a lawyer here, and I don't remember who this is here. I ought to write on them, shouldn't I? That's Paul Parks. I don't know who that is. This, of course, is Ed [Brooke], Mrs. Volpe, and then Mrs. Augusta Bailey who was chairman of that whole thing.
TLM:	That event? May 1966.
MAC:	And this is the same thing at the pool.
TLM:	The dedication of the pool. You're speaking there.
MAC:	Accepting the honor. That's one of the friends. Well, that's all.
TLM:	"Racial Peace Hailed." Civil rights movement?
MAC: I was interviewed by the___of course they had Boston's Negro
leaders and I was one that was interviewed.﻿124
TLM: The Christian Science Monitor.
MAC: I was interviewed. [They wanted] your opinion about civil rights, and I just simply said that I thought, I felt this unity in the civil rights movement is unnecessary. They wanted to know if everybody had to get together. I said the various civil rights groups all had the same goal, and all helped to bring the goal closer, and I felt that we ought to each work wherever we are. And I said the great need is for whites and Negroes to communicate, and not just in meetings with speeches. We need to sit down and talk about our everyday lives. In Boston much has been done to bring about relations with ethnic groups. That is where the problem is. It's nice for people out in the suburbs to be interested in our problems, but the fact is that the greatest misunderstanding is among the groups that live close to one another here in the city.
TLM: This was from the Monitor?
MAC: Yes, that's what I said. "What about the charge that the Negro
knows his place and is really quite happy in it? Mrs. Cass states that, 'There is no person in the world who doesn't want to be equal. All Negroes want a better life, but some have become discouraged, because they think things can never change. That discouragement is now leaving the Negro community.'" That was my idea about it, civil rights groups.
TLM: How do you feel about that now?
MAC: Well, I think it's just about the same. I think that people have to realize that we have to work together for whatever it is we're going to do. We can't stay apart, you know. That's the one out to the Myrtle Baptist Church.
TLM: This was the Boston Herald Traveler, May 27, 1968. Oh, this is when you gave the guest...the sermon at the Myrtle Baptist Woman's Day.
MAC: That was the writeup in the paper. Now all these are letters that came to me at the time that they gave me the testimonial in, you know, for the...
TLM: In 1974. [Looking at a scrapbook with letters in it.]
MAC: That's right. Mother of the Year. All these came from people who congratulated me on being Mother of the Year. And that was from the NAACP.
TLM: "Certificate of appreciation...Cape Cod Branch."﻿125
MAC: On Cape Cod, the branch.
TLM: The branch, on June 1, 1975.
MAC: I spoke to them at theiT meeting, and they gave me that. All
these you see are letters from various people. There's one from [Governor] Sargent. There's one from Kevin White, the mayor. There's one from Kenneth Guscott, president of the branch at that time. And there is one from the regional director, Guest, who was from the region of the NAACP, this is the Positive Program of the NAACP; this is from Hansford Brown who was president of our branch, and here is one from the Educational Council of the NAACP.

Charles Bonner, the city administrator.
TLM: John 0'Bryant sent you two.
MAC: Oh, did he?
TLM: He was the Education Committee.
MAC: Oh, this is Charles Bonner, this is...fellow in the manpower of Model Cities. And this is the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Leon Nelson, and this is from the Women's Service Club In-migrant Program that I told you about, all of the different workers who were working there at that time. Alice Freeman, again president of the workshop, I guess, for 1974. Patrick Jones from the Lena Park Community; and this is from Mary Jane Ingman, who﻿126
MAC: (cont.) was president of Action for Boston Community Development; and Bob Coard, who is executive director of ABCD; and from Arthur Eskew, who was the Black Community Media Committee, this was in Freedom House at that time. This is Dick Lawson, who is president of Inner City Corporation Affiliate of Polaroid; and then this is from Esther Williams, who is a coordinator with our [NAACP] educational program. This is from Alice Taylor, a very dear friend I've mentioned many times, who is one of my associates in many ways. And Herbert Tucker, junior, Municipal Court of Dorchester judge, and I know him from a little boy. He was a little boy who lived down the street here. And this is from— what?—oh, Derek Bok, president of Harvard University. Isn't that nice? And then here is from, this is one of my clubs in the Massachusetts State Union, the Martha Briggs Educational Club in New Bedford. This is Reginald Eaves, office of the mayor of the city of Atlanta. He used to be here, with us. This is a little note from Kevin White. And this is from Clarence Donaldson, who is director of OIC.* And here is Freedom House, from Otto and Muriel. Then you had all those others that were laying there loose you didn't bother with. But that's some of them, isn't that wonderful?
TLM:	Yes, oh my. Marvelous!
MAC:	So that's nice, don't you think?
TLM:	Yes, it's a beautiful scrapbook.
MAC:	Not bad.
TLM:	Not bad at all.
MAC:	Now what is this one?
TLM:	You did all right. This is another scrapbook.
MAC:	Oh, that's the event at the Hotel Bradford.
TLM:	At the testimonial for you.
MAC:	That's the one, that you have the picture taken up on the wall, by that young girl.
TLM: Okay, now that last one was...
MAC: That's Mother of the Year, in 1974.
TLM: And this one goes back further.

MAC: No, I wasn't there. But they sent me a picture. Really nice. And this is Mike Haynes's tribute on that day; and Franklin Ilolgate, it's wonderful... He's passed on, but he was a great fellow that helped to get that pool named for me before he went away.
TLM: Now is he a Republican or a Democrat?
MAC: All Democrats. Royal Boiling.
TLM: So did you support him anyway?﻿128
MAC: Oh yes, I always supported him when he ran, all the black ones, I don't care what they were. Edward McCormack. And this is from Reverend Low, superintendent of schools, Archdiocese of Boston. This of course, you know, is Muriel, Otto and Ed Brooke. And this is from Albert Penner, who was the head of our Massachusetts Congregational Conferences. My church is a part of this.

adjacent room.]
MAC: ...The lights are kind of dim.

TLM: I see. That was for coffee hours? And who were the coffee hours for?
MAC: For sharing, well, for the community. We had it every week.
TLM: Open house?
MAC: Every week we had a coffee hour with a speaker, and some civic or some community thing brought to the attention of the people, and I helped to organize the community coffee hour idea in Freedom House, and then they gave me this for citizenship. This is the picture by little Carol Carter who gave it to me 1966 at the banquet at the Hotel Bradford.
TLM: This is a chalk, looks like a chalk painting.

Business ana Professional Women's Sojourner Truth Award, the first one they ever issued.
TLM:	And that's June 1, 1963.

MAC: Mrs. Eleanor Jones is one of them.
TLM: It says "Woman of the Year, 1954." On the citation from the Zeta Phi Beta.﻿132

TLM: That's May 26, 1970.
MAC: And this is the "distinguished award for outstanding service." And what is this?
TLM: That says "Oklahoma City Women, For Outstanding Service as a Federated Club Woman, Oklahoma City, July 28, 1966. National Association of Colored Women's Clubs."
MAC: That's right. This one, I can't see.
TLM: That is "Mamie Reese, national president."
MAC: Yes, she was the president at the time. And this is also one from...
TLM: Difficult to see. It's like a mirror.
MAC: "Outstanding Lay Contribution to Social Welfare."
TLM: "National Association of Social Workers in 1970." And we're
moving around to the... Counter clockwise. By the way, we just moved past your desk. I want to describe it and your letters.
MAC: Full of all kind of literature, papers and everything, a little of everything. Here's the one from the life membership that I took out in the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs. I mean, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
TLM: No. That's Colored Women's Clubs, and that's July '66, "Certificate of Life Membership."
MAC: Yes. That's right, I took that out myself. And this one here is the...
TLM: The next one down? "Presented to Melnea A. Cass for Outstanding Services to Robert Gould Shaw House and Faithful Services to the Greater Boston Community." That is September 19, 1965.

MAC: August 1962. Did you get that one up there?
TLM: Yes. [Mrs. Cass and Tahi Mottl moved from the den and dining room down the hall through the living room, to a small front parlor that overlooks the street.] Okay, we've moved into the front room where the piano is. What is your name for this room?
MAC: This is part of the living room. This is the "Northeastern
Certificate of Doctorate of Humanities," and that was given to me in, let's see, 1969.
TLM: Do you have the exact date? "Fifteenth day of June."
MAC: Fifteenth of June, 1969. This is a trophy from the National
Association of Colored Women's Clubs. I received this last year in 1974 for Mother of the Year honor from them. And this one I received last year.
TLM: Oh, that's another trophy, beautiful silver trophy. The Mother of the Year award was a gold cup.﻿134

TLM: The date on the top is October 18, 1973.
MAC: Each year they give an award, and I happened to get this one. This is Action for Boston Community Development, for becoming honorary board member, a "Citation for Honorary Member of the Board, Action for Boston..."
TLM: This is signed by Kenneth Guscott, and what is the date? August 26, 1970.
MAC: Now way at the top up there...
TLM: Which one? You're talking about the far left top? Oh, shall I
read that? "The New Urban League of Greater Boston first Crispus Attucks Award Banquet, presented to Mrs. Melnea Cass, long time member of the Boston Equal Rights Organization for Crispus Attucks, May 26, 1971" Now what was the Boston Equal Rights Organization for Crispus Attucks?

MAC: Oh, for about the last twenty, twenty-five years.
TLM: Yearly?
MAC: Every March the fifth.
TLM: Who works with you on that?
MAC: We have an organization.
TLM: The group that's mentioned on the plaque?
MAC: Yes, we have a group and we do it every year. Yes, and then the citizens of Boston come, anybody who wants to come and stand with us.
TLM: I see. Oh this, we didn't do this one in the lower left. "Dr. Melnea A. Cass."
MAC: That was from the Women's Service Club; when I received my honorary degree from Simmons College, they sent me that. That was May 30, 1974.
TLM: It says "On the occasion of your seventy-fifth birthday."
MAC: Oh, is that what it is? Yes, that's what it is.
TLM: It has two dates on it. It says "On the occasion of your receiving your honorary Doctor of Humanities from Simmons College, Thursday, May 30, 1974." Then, "Presented on the occasion of your seventy-fifth birthday, June 16, 1974.
MAC: The Women's Service Club, the In-migrant Program, the Homemaker Training Program, and a lot of friends, host of friends. That's nice, huh! And this is Massachusetts Mother of the Year citation, that was Sunday, April 21, 1974. And you had this one.﻿136
TLM: We're going clockwise.
MAC: This is from the "Boston University Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Afro-American Center and Black Women's Collective for Boston University, Outstanding Service and Leadership."
TLM: There's no date on that?
MAC: No. I don't know what that date was. And this is from the Negro history group that I worked with for a long time.
TLM: And that is February 9, 1975. What is the Black History Week Committee of Greater Boston?
MAC: Well, we have every year a program in the Boston Public Library, and we've been doing it now for about ten or fifteen years, and all the clubs of Boston, women's clubs particularly, join together
and sponsor the program.
TLM: You were saying earlier that you were involved in activity around Negro History Week this year too?
MAC: Yes, every year.
TLM: You're going to the Prudential Center?
MAC: I went to the Prudential Center yesterday for an unveiling of an exhibit for Negro History Week, but I didn't have anything to do with that. That was put together by the New England Telephone Company and the Prudential Insurance Company through the Afro-American Museum. But I just participated on the program yesterday. This is from Action for Boston Community Development,"in grateful recognition of your exemplary leadership. One person can make the difference." This was in June; they had a banquet, 1975, and they gave me that one. This one here is a birthday present to me from the children at the day care center of the Y, when I had my eightieth birthday. They made that card and put a little something in from every child in the whole thing, and I just think it's the most gorgeous beautiful thing. They all made a little something and put it on.
TLM: Isn't that beautiful! That's about three feet by two or three feet. Stevie, Yolanda, Jean...
MAC: Every little name. Somebody has put their name. Steve, Yolanda, Jean. This one says Sam. He's got it spelled every kind of way. They all got their names on; they made something. They made it and came and presented it to me that day, at the birthday. That is "Happy Birthday." Isn't that beautiful? I think that's great.﻿137
TLM: These are plaques and photographs on the [living room] table.
MAC: Let's see, this is an "Award to Melnea Cass for Yeoman Service to Resthaven Corporation during 1975, from the Board of Directors, May 1976." That's our Resthaven nursing home.
TLM: Resthaven. Where is Resthaven?
MAC: It's up on Fisher Avenue. It's a home for, well, for everybody, but it was given to us, a little piece of land some years ago by a black lawyer, Benjamin, who wanted to do something for his people, and he gave it to us. But we finally got it built, and it's a beautiful rest home. So many of us have put ourselves into it. They said I was one who helped it. That's my diploma from Boston College. I'm going to get it framed. It's all in Latin.
TLM: Okay, I'm not sure. Just quickly some of the pictures on the wall.
MAC: That's my mother-in-law, Mrs. Rosa Brown, that you heard me talk so much of. That's her. I have my grand, my great-grands...what is this?
TLM: It says "Proclamation by His Excellency Michael S. Dukakis, Governor of..."
MAC: "Massachusetts Mother of the Year."
TLM: ...1975.
MAC: We've mentioned all those things. Oh, he sent me this at the convention last year.
TLM: Is there a date?
MAC: Yes, "1975 Proclamation."
TLM: This is about the '74 award. Okay.
MAC: Well, I guess you got everything now, put it down pretty pat. I'll take this out for you.
TLM: Is this "Crispus Attucks, State House in Boston?"
MAC: They unveiled a plaque there in his memory, and it's a beautiful
thing if you're ever down that way, go in and see it. It's in the library of the Old State House right down... Do you know where the Old State House is? Well, it's right in the library, you go in and ask to see it. It's a beautiful, beautiful plaque. And it certainly is something you should see. That one, you can have, I have two or three of them. Do you want it?
TLM: Yes, I'll put it with the tapes.﻿138
MAC: Yes, you can take that because that's the one...for the library, when the library was dedicated. You can take that because I have another one, but I haven't got any more of those. You can have that if you wish it.
TLM:	Thank you very much.
MAC:	All right. How do you think it made out?
TLM:	Quite well.
MAC:	Good.
TLM: Yes. This was the only picture you say, in the Globe from when the queen* was here? We made this discovery of two pictures we left out.
MAC: That was the mayor's house.
TLM: This is during the Bicentennial.
MAC: This was on the queen's yacht. I was a guest on the yacht.
TLM: That's right.
MAC: ...Along with other people. There were two hundred guests invited to be on her yacht that Sunday afternoon, and I was one. We had been schooled, and told by the committee that you mustn't—the letter they wrote—you mustn't reach your hand out to them unless they reach your hand and want to speak to you. But you say "Your Royal Highness, Your Majesty," and all this. When I got about a couple feet from her almost, she reached out both of her hands to me and she said, "Oh, I'm so happy you're here." And he said, "I am, too." And he reached over and the two of them were squeezing my hands.
TLM: And the photographer snapped...
MAC: Snapped a picture. So I told her, I said, "You don't know how happy I am to meet you in person." I said, "I never thought I would greet a queen or shake hands with a queen." I said, "So I feel this is a great honor." And I said, "We're so happy to have you here in our country, it's really great." She said, "Thank you." So that's it.
TLM: So you were on this yacht?
Queen Elizabeth II of England﻿139
MAC: This was on the yacht, on the deck of the yacht. Each person came up and as they came up, they had a big card and as I came up, my card said "Dr. Melnea Cass," then he put it down and I went over to her. She saw your name as you came...who you were. She didn't call your name, but it was just to announce that it was my turn to go in. They took one by one, that way, each person was announced. And they went over to her and shook hands with her.
TLM: Who did you go to the yacht with?
MAC: Oh, I went with Mike Haynes, and "Jeep" Jones, and Ellen Jackson, and myself. Had a nice time. So the mayoj* sent me. That's when it was "Hisself" walking down the street. He said, "That's me in the middle, before I heard the new tax rate. Hope you enjoy today." He was so happy before he heard the tax rate, he mailed me this. And he wrote me a letter and he said, "Of all the people that were on the yacht, your picture came out in the paper, and the only one. How about me?" So I wrote him, and I said, "Well, you weren't quite important enough to get taken..." So when he saw me, he said, "Well, if you're there, I'm not very important, I know that." I said,""Well, you put my name down to go, you know." He said, "Sure, I wanted you on that yacht." He wrote me a letter, and told me, "I want you on it; be sure to accept the invitation for the yacht." So when I saw him, I said, "You know, none of us will get on that yacht again, because it's not coming in these waters in my life, and yours." And he said, "You know, I want you on the yacht, of all people." And he said, "And we want to go, Kathryn and I want to be on it." So Kathryn said, "Yes, indeed, we wanted you on that yacht." I said, "Well, I was on it." And she certainly was nice to me. I'll never forget it.
And you know, my minister came from Rhodesia, and he was here with us whilst he was going to college, he was our minister. So he graduated and went back to Rhodesia this spring to take up, well, he's got a position in a college. So he came back for a visit here a few weeks ago, and he came by to see me. I wasn't in church, so he came by, and he says, "You know why I came by here? I just had to come." He said, "I was sitting in the school, talking to some people in one of the rooms, and we were looking at TV and having a good time. And on the TV here you come shaking hands with the queen." He said, "I jumped up and screamed and hollered. They said, 'What's the matter?* I said, 'That's one of my church members!' They said, 'Oh, mail...' I said, 'Sure it is!'" So I said, "Well, listen, I've got a clipping out of the paper, I'll give it to you to take back and show them." He said, "That's good, and I can really prove it." He said, "Do you know that's one of the biggest honors that could come to you?" He said, "In order for us to have that in the international press,
Kevin White﻿140
MAC: (cont.) she had to okay it that she could put that on. And she must have told them she wanted it on. Because it's just like that. On the TV, down in South Africa." Wasn't that something?
Till: Yes.
MAC: See, she used that for public relations with all the Africans
that they're pushing and kicking around, and she showed she had some colored woman shaking hands with her in America. See the point? She's smart.
TLM: What do you think about that?
MAC: She's smart, you know. Wasn't that good? So I said, "That's good. Let her do it." So he was tickled to death. He said, "Well, that is history for me." He said, "My country... For you to be on that TV over there in Rhodesia." It was going some, wasn't it? He's very happy about that, oh, he's so tickled to death. And she looked so pretty that day. That's a blue dress. And it's just as simple as it can be. She looked so nice.
TLM: Yes, now I want to take your picture.
MAC: Well, I don't think you'd better take it in this. I'm going to put something on my dress and brush my hair.﻿MELNEA CASS
