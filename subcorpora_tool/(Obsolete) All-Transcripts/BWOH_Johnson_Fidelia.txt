Lucy Brown Franklin: Fidelia Adams Johnson:
This is Fidelia Johnson, Grambling, Louisiana, November 11, 1976.
As early as I can remember, Charles P. Adams was a very strong man physically, and he had a good and a persistent mind. He also worked with people very diligently in the community. Naturally, I can remember the school in its early days, when there was nothing here except woods and a few buildings.
I'm told when he arrived in 1901 to establish this school... He was asked to come by a group of citizens, who were farmers (this is a farming community), to establish a school similar to the school that Booker T. Washington had founded. They wrote to Booker T. Washington and asked for a man and, of course, Charles P. Adams was the man that they recommended to come here and start a school. He came reluctantly, although he was Louisianian by birth. He had thought that he would do something else after completing his work in Tuskegee, but nevertheless he did come to the state, and he started the school in 1901.
Now, it wasn't located in its present location. It was a little further up west known as Allen Greenevicinity. But after a few years, and after some discussion and some differences with Baptist Association people, he moved down to the present location of the school. And for the first thirty-five years, he worked very hard. He did a lot of maneuvering and traveling to raise funds in order to keep the school going. And, on occasion, he had to, of course, fight with the local and state politicians in order to get the school well established. And, in 1928, the school was known as the Negro Normal and Industrial Institute.
Then, it was over thirty years before the﻿2
FAJ: (cont.'d.) school received anything with a steady dependable financial support and it's... It was quite an ordeal for him to get this. He was a giant of a man and, of course, he did found Grambling State, presently known as Grambling State University. And he would be happy to see how it has developed from 1901 to the present.
From 1901 to 1905, he had a faculty of two or three people and, of course, his wife who worked along with him on the idea of an industrial school, which he hoped to develop to the point where it would support the public sector of the community. His purpose was that the people being taught would be able to make a living and to improve living conditions in the community. Now, naturally this program stressed education patterned after Tuskegee. The school was moved from the Allen Greene area to its present location in 1905 and that's the year I was born, (laughter) And of course he purchased a 200-acre plot of land in order to start the school on. There was a philanthropist from San Francisco, California, who wrote to Booker Washington and asked him to name a school in the South that she could be of some aid to. Now, this woman was Mrs. Fidelia Jewett. And this...
LBF: Oh, is that who you're named after?
FAJ: And this is whom I am named after. Booker Washington recommended to her to help this school. So she sent money in order for him to buy this land in order to start the school in its present location.
Now as time went on, progress, as we know, requires changes and continuous evolution, and the growth of an institution is expected, and the institution became kind of a public school in 1912. And then it became known as Lincoln Parish Training School, operating under the direction of the Lincoln Parish School Board in 1918. And in 1928, the school was made a state junior college, designed to train elementary teachers for rural schools.
Then, of course, his keen perception in identifying idealistic people, possessing a high moral character and outstanding leadership, and his intellectual abilities enabled him to early staff his school with strong and worthy individuals. Now amongst some of those who were hired at that time was the present president, Dr. R.W.E. Jones, who succeeded him. So far, Grambling State University has had only two presidents, Charles P. Adams, the founder, and Dr. R.W.E. Jones, who is termed as the builder.
So from 1905 to 1936, Charles P. Adams was the head of the institution. Other persons who worked along with Charles P. Adams who... Some have passed; some have retired. I was one, Fidelia Adams. W.L. Garner, who has retired. Dr. E.L. Cole is still... the vice-president of the college now, and of course Elizabeth Robertson and Mildred Shea Jones who are deceased. And there were others. So for at least thirty-five years, Charles P. Adams and his limited, but able staff worked and maneuvered to obtain and maintain a reputable state-supported institution in Grambling, Louisiana. The support was initiated by﻿3
FAJ: (cont'd.) introducing a bill in the state legislature by Senator Knock in 1928. And even though the bill was opposed, it passed with the support of the new governor who was Huey P. Long. And Governor Long...
LBF: That was in '30... When did you say that was?
FAJ: That was in 1928. Now, having the school state-supported was a dream finally realized and, of course, it was a dream and a privilege to see come true during his administration. He laid a solid foundation as president of the school and, of course, Dr. Jones built on that. He earned and genuinely deserved the respect that was given him. His nickname was "Chief." Some called him "Mr. Grambling"; others called him other things, but the main thing he was called was "Chief." Everybody called him "Chief." And Grambling State University was an institution, originated in a single frame building with limited financial support, that passed through a process of evolution which resulted in an institutional renowned state-supported institution. And I think that will give you some idea about the institution in its early years, and its early building.
LBF: Now tell me about your years at the school. Did you start out in the home economics department?
FAJ: I graduated from Tuskegee in 1929>and I started to work soon after. Well, it was really my first and last job. (laughter)
LBF.: Oh, you're lucky.
FAJ: I started to work then. I had worked one or two summers before I'd
graduated, in summer school. But on a steady basis, I started to work in the summer of 1929. I graduated from Tuskegee Institute in May and started to work in June in 1929. During that time I did many things, although my major was home economics. I taught some home economics. My mother was teaching home economics at that time, so I helped with that. And then I taught some teacher training. I coached girls' basketball and was Dean of Women. All of those sorts of things that I think you'll find on the little sheet I gave to you. At that time, you see, the school was not staffed adequately enough to say that, "You just teach history." Now my daddy taught history and he was a good history teacher and a very good historian; he knew that. President Jones taught mathematics and directed the band, coached baseball, coached football, and all of that. So, we had several duties that we had to do. So, when I went to work steady in 1929, I did...
LBF: A little bit of everything.
FAJ: ... I did a lot of things. I'd do so many things till sometimes I
didn't know actually what I was doing. And then sometimes I had to help with the meal planning for students and that sort of thing.
LBF: As I understand it, Grambling initially was started, or like the forerunners of Grambling, the schools were initially started to do industrial education. What exactly did that mean, and can you put it in the historical perspective?﻿4
FAJ: Industrial education at that time, I think, pertained to that type of education that people would do working mostly with hands. Now, it had agriculture and it had some trades. Industrial arts, I think then they called it... carpentry, and it had some courses in home economics. It wasn't called home economics, what was it called then?
LBF: Domestic science?
FAJ: Domestic science.
LBF: Is that right? Oh...
FAJ: : Domestic science, that's right. It was called domestic science...
LBF: I guess they came back to calling it that, then.
FAJ: This is what it was then. And this was the emphasis because of Charles P. Adams' training at Tuskegee. And you see, this stemmed from there because... You wouldn't remember, but Tuskegee was largely one of these schools that had a lot of this sort of education and it borrowed style from that. But after a time, there was a need for people to do something else. You had to, because of the pressures of time and the economic conditions of people in the community; they needed something else. Therefore, they started teacher education. Now teacher education, and particularly elementary education, was the beginning of that. Now industrial education did not stop. We still have that, but it did see fit at the time to expand.
And the area of elementary education expanded to the point that Grambling State University became noted for its training of people in that field. This phase of education at the university was observed very, very, very early. They had a very strong elementary education program. This program was revised periodically and kept up-to-date to take advantage of current and new methods in the preparation of teachers. Our curriculum always endeavored to embrace the current needs of prospective teachers towards the end of improving teaching strategies designed to assist in the education of our children and for society.
In the summer of 1971, we began to have an experimental program in competence-based education, in teacher education. Majors in the department of elementary education identify themselves early with programs in the department and observe children in the classroom settings, representing their areas and level of interest. They became acquainted with departmental majors, departmental faculty and advisors, sharing in meetings, forums, seminars, dinners which are planned to introduce them in the teaching profession; of course, by this majors are strengthened. I think you'll perhaps find that, I'm quite sure, more student teaching, that is a longer on-site student teaching period, I should say, is done at Grambling State University than most universities. I don't know whether you have checked that out. But we do a whole semester of...
LBF: Of student teaching?﻿5
FAJ: Of student teaching now. And in most places they do six weeks or eight
weeks of student teaching. This had also strengthened the area of teacher education. Now later in 1948, we went into secondary education because we found out that the elementary education field was becoming crowded, so we had to further expand our curriculum. We went into secondary education in home economics, in physical education, went into most of the areas, in secondary fields.
Now, the division of elementary education and secondary education believes that the preparation of good teachers is like a flowing stream that is ever-growing in breadth and depth as majors move toward the achievement of their ultimate goals. Basic and professional competences result from a variety of individualized, personalized experiences in our teacher education courses. Interdisciplinary seminars, on-site or in the laboratory setting, in which competence Is determined by performance and, as I say, this performance is shown or exemplified when they go out in the field and do student teaching.
We find that the desired teacher competences of strengths fall perhaps in three categories: (1) human relations — student understanding himself and others, other cultures, skills and relationship with adults and children of all ethnic groups; (2) behavioral values and skills that reflect statements of behavioral objectives in teaching techniques, methods or strategies fundamental to effective learning and living; (3) content competences, fundamental knowledge or concepts and instructional methods and strategies basic to the development of understanding in science and mathematics, in language arts, in social studies, health and safety, music, art and literature, and career and vocational planning. Now they must show before they go out to do student teaching, in a seminar, that they do have fundamental knowledge of all these areas so they'll be able to teach these children effectively.
So, service competences, of course, embrace evaluation of the stated behavioral objectives. This is understanding and using criteria for appraising self and pupil, and the media and technology selection, and use of appropriate teaching aids and the awareness of the influence of technology in education and of course, teaching techniques, ability to initiate and direct learning experiences that would be appropriate to the needs of respective learning...
LBF: Do most of the teachers stay, most of the graduates of the program, stay in this area?
FAJ: No, they have students from various places and now it's gotten very
cosmopolitan. I know this because as I go on the campus now, and run into students and ask them where they are from, and if you check the registrar's office... I was checking the graduation list the other day. I just picked up one, just to see. We have students now from all over. From Florida, California, New York, we have them from all around. There was a time when most of our students did come basically from the area, you know and perhaps...﻿Lbf: The practice teaching is all done around here?
FAJ: All the practice teaching is done close by in related parishes. You
know, we have parishes in Louisiana. And some practice teaching is done here at the laboratory schools. Some students are down at Ruston at the public schools and then some students stay around the Shreveport area; that's Caddo Parish. Some is done around Monroe; that's Ouachita Parish. Some is done around Alexandria, which is Rapides Parish. The school is in line with school boards and school superintendents as far as, you know, what schools might be used.
Now, in the schools that they use for student teaching, the teacher that they are directly under has to be certified. She has to have a certain number of hours in supervision before she can qualify to have a student teacher. Now the school pays each supervising teacher, they're called, ascertain amount. I don't know exactly what that is now, but they do pay for students each semester. I know at one time they were paying $75; it may be up now. But they do pay that supervising teacher for handling that. Now some supervising teachers are able to handle one, some two, you know, persons, depending on the strengths of that supervising teacher. And you know, what she's teaching...
LBF: Oh, you think there are any particular needs that the teachers that
come out of this program have to... any needs, say, of the students that they're going to be dealing with, that are different from another area of the country or another area of the state?
FAJ: I think good teaching is basic; and I think if you're a good teacher in one area, you should be a good teacher in another area. And usually kids are about the same; all learn about the same. You know, they all learn. Now the experiences that they have might vary some depending on the place of emphasis. For example, the experiences that a child would have in California would vary from the experiences around here, the experiences of one, say, in Miami, Florida, and we have a lot of students from down there.
LBF: That's what I gather.
FAJ: "Miss Grambling" is from Miami.
LBF: That's right, I saw that in the paper.
FAJ: ... might be different, you know, different; but they are experiences. And a'good teacher, or a competent teacher, ought to be able to recognize...
LBF: Get past those experiences and still teach them basics.
FAJ: Yes.
LBF: You've been active in the teachers' associations around the area. What has it been like to get the teachers in the area together. What have been some of the issues you've addressed and some of the problems you've had to deal with?﻿7
FAJ: Well, I have belonged to the American Home Economics Association
for years. Now we have a state association that I belong to also. And of course the state association was once kind of segregated. It isn't now. It's all together. And dealing with students, with high school
students___Once upon a time, we had a Homemakers' Club; we later
joined the New Homemakers of America. And you know, the same thing, we have them with the boys, and it was not integrated. Now, the experiences and the growth of children in the organization and with the state organization, we felt... were very good. We had regular annual meetings,and in fact the state organization meets twice a year for colleges and universities. Regular programs are set up, based on perhaps the thinking of the group as far as what the discussion should be, and speakers are brought in to discuss maybe problems that would arise at schools.
There's a student organization in the state organization for the development of students, you know, in that. Now, there was another organization known as the Louisiana Educational Association that everyone belonged to. And within this state, within this organization, every segment of it, you had your own division and you would set up your program. For example, they would start a meeting Monday, LEA... They are having a little stew now because... of the effort to combine LTA, which is white, and LEA, which is black, into NEA. So NEA is in the middle of it now. Now this hasn't happened during my time. So we're trying to wait to see if they're going to merge. And...
LBF: What does it look like? Can you tell?
FAJ: Right now it seems as if they don't have a choice.
LBF: They're going to have to...
FAJ: They're going to have to merge, you see, because as it is, LTA is left out, which is why LEA has been divided and has been accepted by NEA.
LBF: Oh, when was that?
FAJ: Well, they've been at this about the last five or six years.
LBF: They've been recognized by NEA?
FAJ: Uh huh. And so LTA...
LBF: Well, tell me. How did they get the recognition and the other group, the white group didn't? Were they just better organized?
FAJ: It was how the organization was set up, I think. And how it was run,
and it was the group really that was being segregated against, you see. It's a kind of a queer thing...
LBF: Yes, I was getting ready to say...
FAJ: Kind of unusual.﻿8
LBF: And that's been...
FAJ: And when they thought they were going to merge at one time, they couldn't come together on agreement as to who was going to run the thing, you know, and then money comes in...
LBF: As always.
FAJ: So this is... yes. See, LEA has J.K. Haynes who has fought and helped
teachers fight a lot of discrimination as far as individuals are concerned, when it came to equal opportunities, when it comes to equal treatment in public schools. Where they were put out, they would go to LEA and they didn't have the money and LEA would put up the money, and fight the. suits.
LBF: Oh really?
FAJ: Yes. You see.
LBF: Where would they get the money? Is that from support among the members?
FAJ: The members, uh hum. It's well supported by dues and they have an
executive secretary and treasurer, all of that, you know. It's run real...
LBF: About how old an organization is that?
FAJ: Oh, as far as I can remember. My father once was president. And he was president way back in 19..., shortly after I was out of college. It must have been in the early thirties.
LBF: Early thirties. About how many members?
FAJ: Now, most all the black teachers in the state belong, you know, which is quite a number. I couldn't give you that exact figure right off.
LBF: Well, is it like about a thousand or... more than that?
FAJ: I'm sure it's more than that.
LBF: Under five thousand?
FAJ: Now we have some teachers, some black teachers who belong to LTA too,
because LTA said, you know, later, that you could join them... although the two organizations hadn't come together as one. So you got some teachers in the LTA, some black teachers in the LTA, but the majority of them in LEA. And I don't know that proportion right off.
LBF: You think they'll make some kind of decision about whether to merge or will it be this year?
FAJ: They're supposed to make the decision Monday.
LBF: Oh, that close?﻿9
FAJ: If anything comes out in the paper, I'll send it to you. But... I hope they will anyway. I mean, it's no point...
LBF: Well it'd make it a better, a more viable organization.
FAJ: Right, right. And they're all fighting for the same thing and right through here, it's been hard for them to get the salary raise that they want. And with one body to... Well, it really would strengthen their efforts in getting salary raises. That is the truth.
LBF: So they lobby with the state legislature?
FAJ: Yes.
LBF: Well, what are some of the issues besides salary raises, what else?
FAJ: I've been out of it about six years. I know the salary issue is the
biggest issue right now. Now, they do have, and they have been discussing about state Superintendent of Education requiring quality teachers. And I'm pretty sure this is going to be an issue, of finding out who's a quality teacher, and people being certified in certain fields, and if you aren't certified in a field then you can't teach in that particular field. They're also concerned about moving people out of a qualified area that they are in into another one. You see, with the coming of integration, we've had a lot of misplaced teachers, like principals of schools being put in some other capacity (black principals). And like coaches in black schools have been made, not head coaches like they were, but made assistant coaches, or they have been moved into administration or somewhere else in the school, you see. This has been a problem and I'm pretty sure...
LBF: Well, do you think, like, just to put more blacks into different places or...
FAJ: Well, take for example, there is a school in Ruston that's known as Ruston High'School; it was all black. When it was integrated with the high school in Ruston, you see, this moved out some of the black teachers in teaching fields over at the white school. And all of the schools in this parish are pretty near totally integrated as far as children and teachers are concerned. But the principal... the man who was principal at that school was moved... in the head office, you see. The coach in the black school was made assistant coach to someone that they just brought in, instead of being made head coach. He filed a suit and he won his suit. So they had to pay him back salary and they had to make him... this year, head coach. They had to, by court order, make him head coach.
LBF: Okay, so what you're saying is like with the coming of integration, people were just trying to put blacks into positions...
FAJ: They were using...
LBF: Using them, putting them into different positions...
FAJ: Yes, whatever you had was...﻿10
LBF: Just like to qualify for some federal law... whether or not they were qualified.
FAJ: Right, qualified or not. They'd take a science teacher and put him in reading, you know, and that sort of thing.
LBF: And then they wonder why the kids can't read.
FAJ: Yes, that's right. Kind of bad.
LBF: Does the teachers' organization discuss much on school curriculum, what the school ought to have?
FAJ: The sections of the association deal with curriculum in that particular area. For instance, the home economics section of HEA or LEA would deal with curriculum, curriculum building and that sort of thing. If we need changes in curriculum, or what additions do we need, how can we strengthen, say, the child development area, or how can we strengthen the family living area, and so on. Mrs. Moss, who was here a few minutes ago, is teacher-educator in home economics. She's in charge of student teaching.
LBF: Are the schools of each parish run by, say, a parish school board, or is there a state school board that runs all of them...?
FAJ: No, you have a parish Superintendent of Schools and a staff. He has a staff. He has supervisors on his staff in certain areas. And the parish schools are run by them plus the board, the Parish board. The schools are directly under the parish Superintendent of Schools and his staff and, of course, of the parish school board. They have a school board in each parish.
Then of course, now the state Superintendent of Education also... They get their books through the state department, get the supplies through the state department; and then the state Superintendent of Education has much to do with the qualifications of the teachers and whether or not they're teaching in their right field. Now we have a new Superintendent of Education who says now that, well, a lot of people will have to go back to school because you have to really qualify. Now this has come with this displacement. Like, they're taking a person and putting him in guidance, you know; this is a field that they've thrown a lot of people in. And special education is another field that they've put a lot of people in, and a lot of people had to drop out this year to go back to school to try to get qualified. And sometimes they have...
LBF: Why do they move them into this?
FAJ: ... I don't know. I have a cousin up here at Arcadia, a married cousin, Mona. She was a journalism major. And after she finished journalism, she went to Louisiana Tech in Ruston to certify in elementary education and did some student teaching, but she still didn't qualify. I don't know why... And she had taught. She qualified in English, but she got a job in elementary education last year as a replacement. Now this year, she doesn't have a job, because she couldn't get one in her field and then she didn't qualify in elementary education. You see, she still has to go﻿11
FAJ: (cont.'d.) back to school and do some more work.
LBF: If she goes back to school, will the state pay for it, or will she have to pay for it?
FAJ: No, she will have to pay for that herself. See, she didn't have tenure or anything.
LBF: How long does it take to get tenure?
FAJ: Three years.
LBF: This is Lincoln Parish, right?
FAJ: Lincoln Parish.
LBF: Is Lincoln Parish predominantly black or not?
FAJ: It's about forty-fifty.
LBF: Forty-fifty?
FAJ: Yes, it's about forty percent black. High percentage. They're going to
have a bond issue tomorrow in order to get some repairs and new buildings. There is quite an issue over that between the school board and the blacks out here. I don't know how it will ever come out.
LBF: The bond issue? Was that the money for the black schools?
FAJ: You see, out here we have just the laboratory school, and they said we need a parish school. This is what a group of blacks feel out here, and they tried to stop the bond issue but they couldn't. So until they could get something settled... and they are filing a suit against the school board saying that they need a public school here. The school, the laboratory school here, is really under the jurisdiction of the college.
LBF:	Of Grambling . And that's a high school?
FAJ:	Well, high school, junior high and elementary.
LBF:	And there's no other public... there is no public school at all?
FAJ:	No.
LBF:	Oh. Well, how long has the laboratory school been going?
FAJ: We've had a laboratory school ever since we started teacher education. Must have been 1936.
LBF: And is there any state money...
FAJ: Oh yes.﻿12

LBF:
FAJ:
when Grambling gets its money, they earmark part for the laboratory school? Or does Grambling just designate part of the money for the school?
No, Grambling furnishes the buildings and pays a teacher's supplement. Now the parish pays the basic salaries for the teachers, and the college pays the supplement to add to that, which really makes the teachers up here at the laboratory school get more pay than those out here just in the parish.
Oh, that's right, because they get it from two different sources.
Right.
The School of Education is probably the most popular?
The School of Education is real popular. Now I understand that you've had perhaps a little drop in enrollment in teacher education because of other fields, you know, that have entered in, like the business...
Oh, they just... is that a recent...
...curriculum. Well, it is recent, you know, compared to education because we*started with education. But you see, we have this diversity, I suppose. And the students have been able to get real good jobs in business administration and accounting and other fields of business. They have students everywhere, all over the country in this field. And of course we do have, well,we have the applied sciences, and then home economics, and then you have physical education. Then we have other education fields which have gotten real popular, like early childhood education and you know,
some more fields...
Is there like a school of communication? You know, like for media, learning how to... ?
Yes, they have media but I don't think we offer a degree in it.
When you were associated with the school, did you find much need to provide remedial help or for remedial programs for the incoming freshmen or something? Do they still have to do that?
Yes. Still do.
What was the problem, usually reading?
Yes, reading and math are two of... perhaps the most outstanding, especially the'language arts... language arts...
Language arts. That's like French or Spanish or something like that... What other languages does Grambling offer?
Besides foreign languages, math and reading, skills in... Natural sciences like physics and chemistry still give many of our students problems.﻿13
LBF: Tell them to join the club, there are a whole bunch of us that have had trouble with chemistry!
FA J: I thought I'd gather some material for you while you were out; I thought it might help you, like the fall enrollment this year was 4,051...
LBF: Give me a second, let me...
FAJ: No, I'm going to give you this. And I got this for you and the number of freshmen and sophomores, juniors and...
LBF; How big is the entire school?
FAJ: There's a total enrollment now of 205 graduate students. We started our graduate program about a year or so ago.
LBF: Oh, I didn't know that. In education?
FAJ: Yes.
LBF FAJ
LBF:
FAJ:
Are there any other plans for any other graduate programs?
Yes, I think so. They probably will expand. This data gives the College of Business, the Applied Program, 43 faculty members; the College of Education, 36; the College of Arts and Sciences, 131; the Division of General Studies,8; and faculty members with terminal degrees; tells about the physical plant and the undergraduate degree programs here and then the graduate program. So I thought this would be something that you perhaps could have to use if you wanted.
Oh, I was looking for this yesterday. When I came in, I was looking for this. Do most of the students that graduate stay around here or do they
usually go?
You know, it's a curious thing about students. Students will, if they can, try to stay home. That's typical of Southern students. Now those from off the West Coast or out East or down around the Miami area will seek work anywhere. Those from the South usually will go back home and seek work Now if they can't find any in their local parishes, then they'll branch out'somewhere. We try to tell them in orientation that you need to select the field that jobs are needed most in. And then if you have to leave your home to get a job, then leave home to get a job! But there again... you might do something else.
LBF: But get a job!
FAJ: And we have this, these programs where they bring in consultants for job appraisal... is it called that? I forget the name, but anyway, you have people in'all areas in to talk to students. And they have people coming in interviewing students in the spring for various jobs, various kinds of industry and teaching and this sort of thing. So it's real informational. Now I thought that you would want this. This is the Department of Elementary Education, the history of it and purpose and preparation and﻿14
FAJ: (cont.'d.) all. So I got that document for you,and here is a listing of programs in secondary education. I mentioned those: art, biology, business, chemistry, English, French, home economics, industrial art, mathematics, education, music, office education, social science education, Spanish, speech and drama, speech, language and hearing specialists. And then there's your master's degree program. Then, early childhood education and elementary education. So that gives you that. This was done in the Department of Education... they send me all this...
LBF: They keep you in touch with what's going on.
FAJ: They think I read it all. Here's some statistical facts that I thought would be pertinent to that. They don't say too much about the graduate degree program because it just started in 1974. And it offers a master's degree but it is really coming on... and early childhood education... I really thought that they should have started much earlier than it did. In fact we tried to get it started before I retired.
LBF: Oh really? When did you retire?
FAJ: 1970. I thought you would be interested in statistical data.
LBF: I'm going to send it right along. Numbers just floor me.
FAJ: And this is another something that was done on Charles P. Adams...
So I thought that was... college material. "At Grambling there is a wide variety of offerings in the field of education, science and technology, liberal arts and general studies to further your education and prepare you for a good job and a good living. Those interested in securing for themselves the Grambling College type of education should write to..." and then it says to the Office of Admissions to see what their chances are and so forth.
LBF: That's a nice looking kid in the picture. In the forty years you were at Grambling, what changes did you see in the student body? The types of students that came here and what their needs were...?
FAJ: Let me tell you something. When I first started working, the students then were quite, quite rural and they didn't think... Well, they were neat, you know, and they were clean students, but they didn't think too much'in terms of style and dress. They were typical rural students; the clothes that they wore were mostly made at home and, of course, to the best that people sew, so they were quite rural. Now as time went on and as the school grew and bringing in teachers from other places, and as the community grew, well, you began to see a difference in their actions because of training. You got to see the difference in their actions because of what they saw, and they began to think in terms of fashion. And they just were a better looking group of students. I don't know whether you are too familiar with rural people but you can get some very pretty rural people. You know, if you can just iron out the wrinkles and get them all situated and fixed up. This is what we tried to do.
We tried to work very close with our students in terms of their looks﻿15

(cont.'d.) and their actions and the places that they had to go and how they should present themselves there, how they presented themselves to the public. We worked with them when it was time to get a jot} to make them aware of the importance of how you present yourself, how you're going to talk to this man who you want to hire you and this sort of thing. And to know what these actions and looks meant to you in the future. So now we have a good looking student body. But now we had this riot around in 19... when all this uprising came and...
Late sixties. Mmmm. I don't... Like 168 and...
Well, it swept through Grambling too. We had our times, too, of campus tearing up, window breaking and having sit-ups all night. I sat up all night up there, you know, trying to console students, settle them down and make them feel that nothing was going to happen. But then we had boycotting games, we had...
Boycotting the football games?
Uh huh, we had a little of everything that happened to most other schools. It wasn't as bad or as drastic, perhaps, as it was at other schools,and we got ours quieted down a little earlier. But we felt the effects of that, the next year, especially in enrollment. This is when our enrollment dropped from 4,000. Actually this year is the first year that we have gained our momentum back...
Oh, it has started going back up?
It's going back up past 4,000 now. You can see that in the basic statistics. And students... you remember all the long hairs and all the what you call them? Well, we had all that too. But it seems as if the students are better when it comes to deportment, how they act on the campus. They are kind of retrenching back to looking neat and hair groomed properly and right. Now some of the hairdos, what you called them?
Oh, Afros?
Afros. I like them. But when they go to the extreme, I don't like them then. And it depends on who it is on, how it is going to look too. And the campus is cleaner, because there used to be a period in town when we just had a time with keeping the campus clean. They'd just throw down trash anywhere. I guess all campuses went through that period. You're too young...
No no. I remember that because I remember, you know, a lot of the problems that Howard was having. A building strike.﻿16
FAJ: So, it was pretty quiet. And then it got to a place once,during this
period, you could hardly get them in Lyceum programs and chapel programs like they were. But they're going back to that now and they want them. And students themselves are saying that we need better Lyceum programs. So this is good.
LBF: During that period were most of the, you know, "rebellious" students, were they from around the area or were they from...?
FAJ: Yes, they were from around the area. You had some infiltration, but the majority of them were from right around in the state.
LBF: Now tell me now, why did they want to stop the football game? That one blows my mind.
FAJ: Well, they were just... they didn't stop it but they...
LBF: Well, there were attempts, weren't they...? You said there were boycotts... strikes, some of them...
FAJ: I remember one game that they said they were going to boycott, and I've
forgotten who played. But anyway when we got there, there wasn't anybody on the students' side, you know, in the stadium. And pretty soon the stadium filled up, but it filled up with outsiders, you know, people coming to the game. They were happy because they got the seats. And we looked down on the side of the hill on the ground, on blankets and whatever. Just sitting out around on the ground,and so that didn't do so well for them because they really did a favor. It seems as if we were playing somebody, it might have been somebody like, somebody who drew a big crowd. You know, Grambling draws crowds for football.
LBF: I know. I was going to say.
FAJ: We were all ready. So they didn't do anything harming there at all. Some of them acted up and down the streets. People looked at them.
LBF: They were like, trying to disrupt the games in New Orleans. That superdome game? You know?
FAJ: No. This time? No, all that's past. If anything interrupted that, it would be a drunk.
LBF: They probably had a number of them.
FAJ: They'd put him out.
LBF: I was getting ready to say. He will not last long.
FAJ: Charles P. Adams... Papa had done a little writing before he died. He
didn't do too very much, but he had written something about his life work, and they have an archives that they have started up at the University. The person who's over the archives, in the history department, is a very good friend of mine, so I gave her...﻿17
LBF: Oh, who's that?
FAJ: Dr. Bailey, Dr. Minnie Bailey... this manuscript that I have* and she did this from that manuscript and I just thought maybe you might... it's...
LBF: Is she going to try and get it published or what? Is she going to try and have it published?
FAJ: No, not that I know of. I thought she did a good job with it.
LBF: Was it handwritten, the manuscript?
FAJ: Uh huh.
LBF: Yeah, this is very good. And is she still working on it or is this her final...?
FAJ: No. She did that but she has, you know, a piece that I gave her in the archives.﻿FIDELIA ADAMS JOHNSON
