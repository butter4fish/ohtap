 Neurohr. I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is November 17, 2007, and I   m at the Bradley Three  Ranch in Memphis, Texas interviewing Minnie Lou Ottinger Bradley.  This interview is being conducted as part of O-STATE Stories, an oral  history project of the OSU Library. Thank you for letting me come  today.  Well, thank you for coming. It will be my pleasure.  Okay, could you tell me where you are from originally?  I was raised at Hydro, Oklahoma, and finished school at Hydro.  What made you decide to go to school at Oklahoma A M?  I   m probably one of the more fortunate people because in the fifth grade  I announced what my life was gonna be and really haven   t varied from  it. I told everybody I was gonna go to Oklahoma A M and be on their  livestock judging team. I got involved in livestock at a real young age  and dearly loved it. I don   t care anything about dogs and don   t care  anything about cats. I always have to have big animals and my dad was  good enough to always let me be his boy and I went with him  everywhere. They started me out with pigs because I could handle those,  and lambs.  Then my dad   I was going to all the livestock shows, and he couldn   t  go so I was kind of there with the FFA teacher, Clyde Qualebaum from  Hydro. Well, actually, Charlie Hogan started me out and then he moved  on and Mr. Qualebaum took over. It wasn   t anything to them because I  couldn   t be in FFA, couldn   t be in agriculture because I was a girl. Of  5  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  course I was too young at that time anyway, but they took me on and  hauled me to all the livestock shows and helped me with everything.  When I got to be about twelve or thirteen, my dad said,    I   d rather for  you to be in the cattle barns and the hog barns if you   ve got to go to all  these shows,    so I got in the cattle barns at that time.  I went over to Skiatook, Oklahoma and bought an Angus cow and a bull  calf and that was my start in the cattle business. But I just had that dream  all along because I loved to go to these little local 4-H judging contests.  I   d get my dad on a Saturday or Sunday   wherever they were having  one in the state of Oklahoma   I   d get him to drive me. There wasn   t  anybody to really coach me, but you could buy books on how to judge  livestock. I probably never read another book except that book, but I  studied those and said,    I   m going.    So when I graduated from high  school that   s what I decided to do.  Were there many girls when you were in 4-H that were interested in  livestock judging like you were?  I don   t know in livestock judging. There would be several showing  calves and what have you at the livestock shows, but as far as judging, I  don   t think there were   you know, in 4-H and FFA. Then of course  when I got up to Oklahoma A M, I had no idea that there weren   t any  girls, but there weren   t. (Laughs) So I went up there, and Mr. Glen  Bratcher was the coach at that time.  And that was the fall of 1949?  Correct. And I was gonna have animal husbandry. It   s now animal  science, then it was animal husbandry, class under him. From all the  shows and all, I knew who he was from seeing his picture and all. I just  walked up to him and said,    I want to be on your judging team.    I didn   t  know if you could be a freshman on the judging team. I didn   t know  anything. I just said,    I   m gonna be on your judging team,    and he kind  of looked at me and he said,    If you   re good enough, you will be,    and  that was the start.  Had he ever met you before then or heard of you?  No, no.  No?  No, and I   ll tell a funny story if you want me to go ahead about what  happened.  6  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Yes.  I started working out, and of course you got serious about it your junior  and senior year, that   s when you got to travel. Well, it came along and  we started out with about two hundred boys and me and got it down to  about twenty-five, and I knew I was doing okay, you know. It came time  to go to Denver. Well, to begin with, I thought I   d better not put all my  luck into this livestock judging so I started working out on the meats  judging team, too. One of my experiences that I   ll never forget was  Christmas my junior year. You had to go back up there and start judging  before school started, and I had to stay in Willard Hall. I was the only  human being in there, and that was the biggest hall and I could hear  more things going on than anything alive. (Laughs)  What floor were you on?  I can   t remember if I was on the third or fourth floor, but I thought,    Oh,  God.    But anyway, Dr. Walters was the meat coach and he knew I was  walking, because then you didn   t have cars, I mean, very few of us had  cars. And I would walk from Willard to the Animal Husbandry  Building   and so he picked me up one day and I found out why he  picked me up. It wasn   t to keep me from walking, he said,    You   ve got  to make up your mind now which way you   re gonna go, if you   re gonna  go on the meats judging or the livestock judging.    I said,    Dr. Walters, I  believe I   m really better in livestock than I am meats.    He said,    You  really are. I think you should go that way.    Probably wanting to say,     Oh, good. I won   t have to put up with you now      I continued working out on the livestock   and Denver was our first  show. They were gonna post the name on the door, and I went over there  and my name wasn   t on the list and I was hurt. I couldn   t figure it out     it never dawned on me. Then Mr. Bratcher called me into his office and  he said,    I made a deal with you two years ago   if you were good  enough, but I didn   t think you   d make it.    He said,    Now we don   t know  what to do.    He said,    Your voice isn   t low enough. I just don   t think we  can use you because I don   t think the judges there would accept a female  voice.    I knew I was the top and it really hurt, but I went home and went  back to the dorm.  So next workout I was there and it was Fort Worth time. I went over  there and he called me in to his office and he said,    We   ve got a real  problem.    He said,    I   ve either got to break my word to you or take  you.    He said,    We have met with the dean of students, the dean of  women, the dean of agriculture, the president of the college, and there   s  no law. We   ve all read all the rules we can find and we cannot see a  thing that says six boys, a coach and a girl can   t travel together.    And of  7  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  course I   d been traveling when we   d go places to work out I was there,  but this was gonna be overnight you know. (Laughs) He said,    Well, I  guess we   ll take you.     The thing I always remember about Mr. Bratcher is that the morning that  we were gonna judge at Fort Worth   and another thing   the first time  being with them overnight, he put me on the same floor with him and the  boys on another floor. I kept thinking,    I don   t know what you   re  thinking about. The elevator stops each place,    you know. He thought I  was safe if I was on the floor with him. But we were eating breakfast  and all of a sudden all of these other coaches were in there. They started  talking and they said,    I think Glen Bratcher said in Chicago back in  December that one thing he   d never do is carry a girl on his judging  team.    Of course, they said it loud enough that he could hear and I could  hear   and I thought,    Oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness.    They were  giving him a hard time, and I looked over to him and I said,    Have I  really caused you a lot of problems?    He said,    Well, you made me  swallow a lot of things that I said   ,    but he said,       you   re here. You   ll  be okay.    So that made me think a lot of him because I know he was  under a lot of pressure.  Dr. Darlow was the head of the department at the time, and he was a  gruff old guy. A lot of kids were scared of him. He walked up to me just  as I got out of the old station wagon there at Fort Worth yards to judge.  He took me aside and he said,    You   re the first girl, and if you don   t  come through today, you   ll be the last one.    Well, I thought,    Okay, just  go out there and do your best,    you know, and I had a good day. Oh, I  think I won first or second in hogs that day, but overall I didn   t place,  but they were happy. This was my first outing, and so from then on, why  I was just a regular on the team and had some good days after that.  Well, good. That was quite a trip then.  Well, it really was. I still see some people today that remember that day.  Well, you mentioned how the other coaches were reacting about that     what about the other students that you were around in Fort Worth at  that time?  They kind of sloughed me along. Well, two different things. In Kansas  City, that was one of the bigger ones, I pretty well proved myself to the  school. I   d been top at the school judging and what have you, so the  boys accepted me fine. But at that time Texas A M was an all-male  school and I didn   t know Texas A M from any other place in the  United States at that time, or a lot of these other schools. I was a little     ole hometown girl and never had been very many places. But I couldn   t  8  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  imagine   that Texas A M team came up to me after Kansas City right  after the awards ceremony and I   d placed in the top ten and had won the  beef cattle judging, and they said,    You   ll never embarrass us like this  again.      Texas A M   and I got with Mr. Bratcher and I said,    What is  it?    He said,    Well, that happens to be an all-male school and they just  don   t accept girls.    (Laughs) So anyway, I said,    Okay.     Then in Chicago, why it was a real funny thing happened to me. We had  a class of Shropshire ewes and you sat at these long tables and worked  on your reasons that you were gonna give, and there was a young man  from Arkansas, I believe it was. He saw how I placed and he punched  me   you   re not supposed to talk   and he said,    You busted that class  and you   d better talk them a different way.    And another little kid heard  him on the other side and said,    Boy, you busted that class,    and I  thought,    I   ve had just as good a coach as anybody here. I think I   m just  gonna stay with my deal.    So I went in there and talked them and I  talked a perfect fifty and I know why now because I was the only one  besides the judge that judged the class that selected them like he did.  (Laughs) I don   t know who was right or wrong, but it was a good day  for me   and so I had several incidents.  In Kansas City, the judge that took my reasons, he worked me over  pretty good. When I walked out I knew one of the fellas at the door   he  used to be an FFA teacher in Oklahoma   and so I told him. I said,    I  got worked over pretty good.    He said,    You did?    And I said,    Yes.     He came back in a few minutes and said,    He may have worked you  over, but he gave you a fifty.    So I could probably talk my way out of  most anything I misplaced pretty good.  So when you say    worked you over,    just making you defend the scores  that you had come up with?  Yes, yes. And maybe they did to a lot of the boys, too, I don   t know.  But it just seemed like to me that,    Man, I   ve gave my reasons,    you  know,    I   m not gonna renege on them. This is the way I saw it,    and he  said,    Are you sure about that?    And I   d say,    I   m sure.     So you really had to be certain and confident then?  Yes, yes. And then a big thing was, we   d had a wreck going up there. In  Indiana, we turned to the wrong lane and a Greyhound bus hit us and  pretty well tore up the rig and     What were you all traveling in?  Then they called them old station wagons. Of course, there were seven  9  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  of us   eight of us actually in this   and we were loaded. It was a good  thing we just slid when he hit us. We just slid but it knocked all the rear  windows out.  Wow.  And we didn   t get it fixed before we left   gonna leave Chicago and it  was pretty cold and Dave Garraway   s show   I think it was   was it  Good Morning America, was it? Or whatever and   anyway, Dave  Garraway, which most people today wouldn   t know but he was the star  of that, and he wanted me to stay and be on their show.  On their TV program?  Two or three mornings, and so Mr. Bratcher cut a deal with that station  or affiliate, whatever it was, to buy me a ticket home on the train if I  stayed and they did that. So that gave everybody from my hometown a  thrill when they tuned in a couple mornings. I   d be up there and they   d  have the grand champion steer of the International and I would tell the  public what I saw good about him.  That was a national TV program?  Yeah.  What was the name of the person? Dave     It was Dave Garraway. He was the shining star then. Of course, TV  wasn   t too old at the time. What is it, there   s two TV shows, Good  Morning America and something else today  The Today Show , and I  can   t remember which one he was on.  So what was that experience like?  Well, it was pretty neat. They   d bring that short-horn steer in and walk  him around and I   d tell them why he was the best steer in the show. He  was the wrong color to me. He was a short-horned and I was used to  Angus but I kept my cool and did it anyway. But it was quite an  experience.  Then on the way home, some of the professors were riding on the same  train and Dr. Walters who had been my meats coach, he said,    Well,  why don   t we go back and get your master   s degree and be on my meats  team now?    (Laughter) I told him, I said,    Dr. Walters, I   ve got to see if  I can do anything with what I   ve got before I go back in and try to get  my master   s.    It always kind of bothered me, people went right straight  10  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  through school and didn   t have any practical experience out there in the  real world. I   ve had plenty of practical experience now. (Laughs)  How many years now? (Laughter)  It   s been since    52 so...  Since 1952?  Well, I graduated in    53 so actually 54 years in the field, yeah.  Do you still feel like you   re learning?  Every day.  Every day?  Yes. I read a lot, attend a lot of meetings and   yes. When I quit  learning, I   ll be through. Things have really changed, too. (Laughs)  Well, what are two or three things that have just really changed in that  period of time in particular?  Well, the type of livestock   s absolutely changed. Kids get tickled when I  tell them this   but then it was the shortest, fattest whatever it was,  whether it was a barrow or a steer, they had to be fat. Today, you know,  we don   t want all that fat. So the type of animal has completely changed.  The terminology has completely changed. Now they   re all meat animals,  have always been for the same thing, but we got them too little. Then  they were way too little, a 950 pound steer was a big steer. Now we   ve  got them up to 1,400   1,500 pounds. Economics have driven that. But I  look back and it was good change.  We went overboard back in the 70   s. We had them way, way too tall and  not enough meat in them, and today we   re kind of getting back in the  middle. It   s taken 50 years to kind of get to where people look at the  efficiency of the animal and how good a carcass he hangs up and all.  The carcass has changed because the meat-packing industry and  everything else has driven some of that.  You   ve mentioned that at Christmas-time that you had to go back to  school early to get ready for the shows and things. So what were you  doing? What exactly did that involve?  Well, what they do, these judging contests, they   ll have four steers, four  heifers, four barrows, four wethers, whatever. The steers are usually  11  Neurohr  lined up, the barrows will have numbers on them, and the lambs are  usually lined up left to right. You always judge from the rear, left to  right. And the object is to select that animal which is   whether he be a  meat animal or a breeding   for breeding. Of course you want a heifer to  look like a heifer, very feminine. You want a steer to look like a steer  and different qualities you see, the same just in the cattle. But the same  is true in the lambs or pork. Either one is you want a heifer to look like a  heifer and a steer to look like a steer or a bull to look like a bull to begin  with.  They have different attributes, or different finishes you want on them.  You   ve got to have a heifer that looks real feminine, looks like she   s  gonna have a good udder on her, she   s got a good set of legs on her, got  some heart girth on her and some thickness. She   s got to be feminine,  but still she   s got to carry enough beef qualities about her.  Then the main thing, I think about anybody can have an eye for cattle, I  mean, not exactly, but you kind of learn   but then it was giving the  reasons. You had to stand up before a judge and say,    I place this Class  One, Two, Three, Four because I like number one   ,    and so forth. Then  you had to say what was wrong with that calf and then what you liked  about it and then say,    Number two, I placed it second even though I  realize she was a little more feminine than the heifer that I placed above  her   ,    but because of different things, why you placed her second and  go on down the line. So it   s kind of like playing football or basketball or  anything else. It   s a training deal and you had to get in shape for it.  (Laughs)  I think back now how some of the judging was going on and, my  goodness, it wouldn   t be politically correct today. We weren   t winning  all the sheep classes. We were getting beat, and Mr. Bratcher asked Dr.  Darlow to come in because Dr. Darlow, when he coached the team, his  teams always won the sheep. And so he blindfolded all of us. You judge  sheep, particularly the wethers, mainly by feel because they   ve got wool  on them. You can   t tell what they look like, so you have to do it with  your hands. He blindfolded all of us and he always used a cane and you  were going down through there feeling this lamb. If you didn   t have  your fingers right, you can   t tell anything by the end of your fingers  you   ve got to use your hand about like that  Bradley motions . He   d just  take his cane and whack, (Laughs) whack them pretty good. And we got  to so we were winning more than get whacked. (Laughs) I never got  whacked. I happened to do pretty good in the lambs all the time anyway.  I got to thinking,    Oh, now. That wouldn   t work today, would it?     No.  12  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  It   ll make a judger out of you.  I bet it would.  Get them to handling the lambs right, but that   s what it is. And today it   s  altogether different. We   ve always had the same intentions, but I guess  you go through different things. Today I think we   re getting back to the  kind of cattle that   and hogs and all that we really need.  The emphasis maybe changed a little or     Yes. Well, but then I believe during the Second World War they used a  lot of that tallow to make explosives or something, and of course that  was one reason they had fat. Then when you got so there   s no market for  fat and then the health issues come along and everything.  Right.  You changed all that up. But the cattle were too little and then they got  them too long and tall and took the meat out and now we   re kind of  getting back to the right kind of cattle. I   m glad I got to witness all that,  yes. It   s been a really interesting ride.  When you judge them and there are four of them there, are you allowed  to have a tape measure or anything or you just have to strictly eyeball  it? Are you comparing that group of four to each other as well as  looking at them individually, too?  Yes, yes. You   ve got to compare them and on market cattle or sheep or  pork, you can have   well you don   t ever have the pork because you can  see them, but you can handle the lambs and you can handle the steers.  So you can go up and touch them and, you know, look at size and stuff  like that?  Yes, and see how much fat is over the top and all that      Oh, okay.  But on the breeding stock you don   t, you just look. And we always said,     Judge cattle from the side view,    is what I was always told. Of course  you   ve got to see that the cattle or whatever species you   re working on,  that they   re functional. It doesn   t matter how good a carcass they hang  up if they can   t go out there and have a calf by themselves and get up  and nurse it and have mothering ability and all that. All that works into  it, so yes.  13  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  So would it be different breeds at the shows, or would you focus on one  or two breeds in particular?  No, you   d never know what you were gonna have. I mean you might,  you   d always have a class of Angus or Herefords. They never put  Hereford and Angus in together. Then you talked about the three breeds.  Then it was Hereford, Angus and Short-Horns and of course today it   s a  lot different, there   s a lot more breeds. I remember at Fort Worth we had  some Brahmas. None of us had ever seen a Brahma. I mean that was  completely, you know, new to us. In Chicago we had to judge draft  horses. (Laughs)  Oh, I bet that was interesting, draft horses.  Well, it really was because all they had at Oklahoma A M at the time  was one little horse that pulled the manure cart. I think the first ones we  looked at were at Indiana, at Purdue, and at the University of Illinois we  saw some on our way to Chicago to judge. Mr. Bratcher said,    Just don   t  get smart about them. Look at the big points because if you try to get too  technical not knowing anything, well you really get in trouble.    He said,     The Canadian boys will be out there and know what they   re doing.  They   ll beat us.    So we had a class of Persians and I didn   t have any  idea what I was looking at really, but I had to get way back to see their  wethers and all because they   re so big, and I got in there and gave  reasons. I   ll never forget, and this guy said,    What about the ears and the  eyes on those horses?    I thought,    They each had two.    (Laughs) That   s  what was going through my mind.    They each had two.    And I thought,     I wonder what he   s looking for?    So I just gambled a little bit and I  thought,    I really like the eye on this   a little brighter and bigger.    Then  I told him,    The ears were sharper   a little shorter and a little sharper  ears.    I was second in an international contest on horses. (Laughter) I  wouldn   t say I knew anything about them, I just got real lucky, I guess.  I think the judging is really good for young people because you have to  make quick decisions. You have to stand by your decisions and kind of  know what you   re doing and go in there and face that    ole boy that  you   ve been told is the meanest man in the world and knows more about  cattle than anybody and all. It was quite an experience.  So were you getting individual points   people on the team   each person  on the team would do their judging and they would earn points. Then  would those points go into a team total, too?  Yes. Our team total and then they   d have individuals, the top ten  individuals and then the top ten teams, yes.  14  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  And you quite often placed pretty high individually?  Well, I was pretty lucky, yes.  Pretty lucky? No, I think you earned it. You worked hard to get that. The  cattle that you all practiced with at OAMC   were there different groups  of cattle coming in and out or were you seeing the same cattle over and  over again?  No, they varied. I mean, they had quite a few cattle up there and they   d  bring us in a class of steers and lambs and all. After you made the travel  team, before you ever selected the team though, it got down to, about, oh  I don   t know, twelve to fifteen of us, maybe twenty. We would go to  farms around. We   d go to Tulsa quite often to work out at an Angus  outfit and to Turner Ranch down in Sulphur, Oklahoma. We made a lot  of trips like that.  Would Dr. Bratcher   when you were practicing and you   d go in and  look at that group, then were you coming and telling him what you saw?  And was he trying to, I guess, grill you like he knew the judges were  gonna do when you were actually in competitive situations?  Well, we had other people. We had other professors that we gave  reasons to there locally and then graduate students. It wouldn   t all be just  Mr. Bratcher.  Were you enrolled in a class as being on the livestock judging team? I   m  sure that must have taken a lot of time?  Well, it took a lot of time. No, no, there was no credit given or anything.  It was just     That was extra. Now your freshman and sophomore years, you did have  classes. It wasn   t called a judging class. It was just like 101 or something  like that, but that was part of it, you go out and   because they wanted  all the kids whether they made judging team or not to     Learn how to     Yes.     look at the animals and everything?  Right. But it was   it   s very interesting.  15  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Well, it is. I   m learning things I didn   t know about the process.  Okay. Oklahoma A M is   well, Oklahoma State now   has always had  a good judging team. I mean, it   s recognized. We were told when I was  on the team,    Go get Ohio. Go get Kansas State. Get Texas A M. Get  K-State    I guess it was   that was the three we were to go get. Then one  of my professors moved to Kentucky and was judging, and we added  Kentucky to our list. He said it doesn   t matter. And the worst thing about  it, we were second in Chicago as a team and Cornell University in New  York slipped in there. I don   t know how they slipped in there, but  anyway (Laughs) they beat us as a team, but I had a good day.  What did you wear when you were in the competitive situations when  you travelled?  Well, it   s funny. All the boys had to wear snap brim hats. Mr. Bratcher  wore a silver bully snap brim hat and all the boys had to wear snap  brims.  What do you mean by snap brim?  Well, you know how a cowboy hat is? Well, this was   the brim was not  big but it wasn   t really real small either, but turned down     Oh, the front was turned down, okay.  That designated you were from Oklahoma State.  Oh really?  And the boys all had to wear dress pants and a jacket. Now there were  other girls on other teams, particularly from the northeast and Canada.  They all wore skirts. I did not. I told Mr. Bratcher, I said,    I don   t know  what any other girls will wear, but I   m gonna wear pants.    I said,    When  I lean over to judge those lambs and all, I   m not gonna be worried about  how I   m squatting down to be a lady at the same time.    He said,    Yes,  you are to wear   ,    so I wore dress pants and a nice shirt and a jacket.  You had to buy your own clothes for the     Oh, yeah. Sure. We had to pay our way. We didn   t have to buy the  gasoline or furnish the car, but everybody had to pay their own  expenses, yeah. We went out to dinner the night before the deal. That  was one of Mr. Bratcher   s things,    Let   s go out and relax and let   s not  get uptight about things.    And we went out for dinner, and the boys said,     We   re going to buy you a big orchid if you win this thing tomorrow.    I  16  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  popped off and said,    I   ll buy you all a steak dinner if I win.    (Laughs)  So I got my orchid and when we got back to OSU, why we all went out  and had a steak dinner. But they didn   t think they were gonna buy an  orchid. I didn   t think I was gonna buy a steak dinner. So it was just a  really great day for me.  And that was the Chicago     Internationals.  Chicago International   that would have been in 195     Two.  1952. And what month of the year?  It   s in November.  In November.  We had Thanksgiving dinner in St. Louis, Missouri on our way up there.  And was that your highest achievement?  Yes. Chicago International was the biggee, yes. I thought I had a pretty  good day and going back to the hotel that evening, why Mr. Bratcher  told me, said,    You had a good day.    I said,    No, I didn   t. When they  gave the official   ,    I said,       Mr. Bratcher, I didn   t do very good. I  didn   t have any busts, but I had some switches.    A switch is like     What do you mean by that?  Okay, okay. Say I   ve placed them one, two, three, four and maybe two,  one, four, three   you know, or put two in the middle, switched them,  whatever   from the official. And so anyway, the only subway I guess  I   ve ever ridden in my life was going out to the stockyards and that day  that we were going out for the awards and he said,    You   re gonna be in  the top ten.    I said,    I don   t think so, Mr. Bratcher.    He said,    I think  you are.    He said,    News leaks a little. You   re gonna be in the top two.     So I thought,    Great.    So they start at ten and go down. And we were all  sitting at the table and they got down to three and my name hadn   t been  called. He reached over and he said,    I   d rather for you to be last than be  second.     What did he mean by that exactly?  17  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  He just didn   t want second, who ever remembers second, you know? So  close and     Yeah, yeah   just kind of the heartbreak, I guess, is a little bit of it.  So they called out second and my name wasn   t and I said,    I   m sorry,  Mr. Bratcher, I let you down.    About that time, they announced my  name and the table went crazy.  Did you feel like it was a historic moment at the time?  I didn   t, no. No, no, no. I didn   t know it till everybody grabbed me up  and started giving me this, that and the other, you know. Dr. Darlow  came right on over and he was one of those that was   like I said, he was  a gruff guy. A lot of kids were scared of him, but he was always good to  me and   but he was gruff. I mean, he snatched a boy off the team at  KC   Kansas City   for a deal, and I thought,    Man, he snatched him up  pretty quick.    (Laughs) And he said,    Have you called your daddy?     And I said,    Well, I haven   t even gotten out of here yet.    He said,    You  go call your daddy right now.     But it was quite historic   they made it that way. I always laugh     Sunday morning   that was on Saturday   and Sunday morning I got on  the elevator, and of course, then they still had that stool in there and an  operator that ran all the elevators. On that stool the Chicago World, I  think it is   anyway, the newspaper up there, the headline was,    Society  Dame Killed,    and my picture. I thought,    What in the world is going  on?    and then on the front page of the Chicago Sunday paper it was a lot  of   and it was written up. Walter Winchell, you wouldn   t know him,  but he was the radio commentator at the time, and it made all the New  York papers, and I still have all of those.  Do you?  People picked some up. Yeah, that was a historic moment that   but I  wasn   t concerned with it at the time, didn   t realize what it was gonna     even for the school, I think it did something. And it   s something that has  carried on all these fifty-some odd years. People still   I mean, I think  that   s what gave me a lot of insight to some things that I   ve been able to  accomplish or has fallen to me or whatever. That was the breakthrough,  I think.  Yeah, I can see that, and I think sometimes there are opportunities  around and people may or may not see them, but you have to be willing  to step up and follow through with them and go for them.  18  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Yeah, I just didn   t know it couldn   t be done. I mean, it   s like some other  things I   ve done. I   ve always said I wasn   t smart enough to look at the  other side of the picture. I just (Laughs) said,    Let   s do it.    (Laughs) So  anyways, I think that   s helped me all these years. That   s been a long,  long time ago, but people still refer to it as   and, of course, since then I  think   it   s been a long time, but I think some girls have won it since  then.  So that was your senior year then or your junior year?  It was my senior year.  So how was the rest of your senior year? After that big defining moment  in November, you still had another semester of school. Did you have  other contests then?  No, no, that ends it.  That was the last one.  You see, that was in November and January   when the juniors, that   s  when they come up.  Oh, okay. So were you helping them that last semester or did you feel  like at loose ends because you weren   t getting ready for competitions  anymore?  Well, I had a little free time. It was the first time I hadn   t taken eighteen  hours. I   d taken eighteen hours   and that was another thing, when I  went up there to enroll, I was a little    ole girl and I didn   t know  anything. My dad took me up there and, it   s funny, I think about all the  things kids take to school with them now. It takes two trailers and a  pick-up to get a kid up there and I had a sister that went with me and I  brought a little baby brother and sister. We all went up there with all the  things we needed out of that one car. My dad said later, he said,    I didn   t  say that,    but he did. I said,    Yeah, you did, dad, and I thought you  meant it.    He said,    If you   re not tough enough to stay, keep going  north.    (Laughter)  Hilton Briggs was assistant head of the department at the time, Dr.  Hilton Briggs   went on to South Dakota after that. He was my advisor,  and I thought all these other boys just had advisors. Well here I had an  assistant dean, and I thought,    Man, I ranked pretty high.    Well, he put  me in eighteen hours that first semester. I had entomology, zoology and  chemistry and English   had eighteen hours   and it almost got me. It  almost got me. But every semester they   d put me in eighteen hours, but I  19  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  made it. And so when I was in Chicago, he was in South Dakota at the  time, and I think he was the dean of agriculture up there, and he asked  Mr. Bratcher if I could ride a taxi with him one day after the judging to  go out there and he said yes. He said,    I   ve got a confession to make,     and I said,    What   s that, Dr. Briggs?    He said,    I was to get rid of you,     and he said,    I just want to apologize to you.     Oh, my.  And I said,    That   s okay. I made it.     So did you feel that way at all then, or did you have any idea that     No, I was     Well, maybe that was a good thing.  I think it was. I think it was a good thing, yeah, because I had one goal  and I didn   t care if I ever had a date. I didn   t care about anything. I  wanted to make that judging team, and I knew I had to make my grades  to do that, you know   and I had a lot of help. Well, first semester but at  mid-term first semester, I think I had about a 25 or 30 in chemistry     something like that, you know. I had got put in with the medical students  and the vet students because they ran out of room. Instead of getting in  Ag chemistry I got put in   and I   d had one little general course in  science in high school. That   s all I had.  Oh goodness.  I had no more idea what they were talking about than this boot, you  know? And I went to him   I can   t recall his name right now   but I will  always be grateful to him. He was my chemistry teacher   and I went to  him and I said,    It doesn   t look like I   m gonna make it.    He said,    Yeah,  you are.    He said,    There   s enough boys dropped out of ag chemistry  that we can always,    he taught both. He said,    We   ll just put you in ag  chemistry. I   m gonna wipe the slate clean and what you make the second  half of this semester is gonna be your grade.    I can   t say I learned it, but  I memorized it, and I had thirteen hours and a B in chemistry. I know  what H2O is, and that   s about all I can tell you. (Laughter) But I will  always be grateful to him. I had him all   in organic and all the other  courses. I had to have a tutor. I had to have a tutor. I found a lady that  would help me, but     Was she at the university? She was?  Yeah. I think she ran the lab more or less, chemistry lab   and I put out  20  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  word I needed a tutor and she helped me, yeah.  Well, you were really determined. If you had the initiative to know that  you needed a tutor and you found one   and when you felt like your  grades were in trouble a little bit, you went and talked to the professor  about it. Some students don   t do that, so that just shows, I think, your  determination to make it.  Like I said, I had a goal and I was gonna...  Yes.  I feel sorry for the kids that don   t have a goal. I see a lot of kids, you  know, say    I   m going to school. I don   t know what I   m going to school  for.     That   s pretty common now, I think.  Yeah. Yeah, and so I   ve always felt real fortunate that I knew what I  wanted to do.  What did you envision   going to school, your goal was to be on the  livestock judging team   and what did you envision doing with your  degree? Your family had land. Did you think you would go back to your  family land?  No. Folks    wasn   t big enough for that, and it was mostly farmers. Well, I  went ahead and got a minor in ag journalism. My major is in animal  husbandry, and I got a minor in journalism because I thought I could get  a job in the ag journalism field somewhere, and so that   s what I did. I   m  assuming you   re talking about my senior year, my second semester   I  worked over there in the ag journalism lab quite a bit helping write  stories for the papers, extension papers and all that and     Did you enjoy that?  Yes. Yeah, and it   s helped me. We put out a newsletter here and do  different things. But the American Angus Association was  headquartered in Chicago at the time, and so after the Chicago deal and  all, things began to open up. Lloyd Miller, who later became executive  vice president of American Angus Association, but then he was head of  public relations, he offered me a job in Chicago with the Angus  Association. I just couldn   t see myself living in Chicago and it was at  the stockyards and all and I thought,    Man, you go through a pretty bad  part of town getting to the stockyards and all.    I was thinking about that  and then I went to Fort Worth to the stock show right after that and  21  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Texas Angus Association offered me a job as field representative. A lot  less money, but it was in Texas and not that far from home and a lot  better part of town. So I accepted that and that   s the only paid job I   ve  ever had in my life. I worked there for nearly two years.  So that was a more comfortable environment, I   m sure?  Yeah, more comfortable environment, yeah. Yeah. Right, yeah, yeah.  Let   s talk about the Block and Bridle team a little bit.  (Laughs) Okay.  I brought the yearbook along and there was a picture in there, and the  first thing that struck me was how many students there were in Block  and Bridle.  Oh, yes.  And could you join as a freshman, Block and Bridle?  No. No.  Okay.  I think you either had to be a sophomore or a junior, I believe. That was  another thing, when I started making good grades, I couldn   t belong to  Alpha Zeta     What   s that?  That   s the agricultural fraternity for good grades.  Oh, okay.  I made it, but I couldn   t because I was a girl and they   d never had a girl,  so I didn   t make that. And they   d never had a girl in Block and Bridle  either. I suppose a lot of discussions went on or something, but anyway I  got initiated in Block and Bridle and went to all their meetings. I was  reporter my senior year, and it was interesting. I   ll have to say, I can  never say that I was mistreated by anybody or I thought I was. I mean, I  just thought everybody treated me equal. People always said,    Are you a  feminist?    And I said,    No.    I never even want people go there with me  that way. I figure I know my business well enough to be treated equal, to  be paid equal. It   s those that are not quite there yet, and so I always  figured if I went through everything like the initiation and I asked them,  22  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  they said,    This is gonna be a tough one for you.    And I said,     Whatever. I can handle it.    Well, I handled it pretty good until I came  into the dorm and the dorm mother met me and asked me what had  happened to me?  And this was after you got their initiation?  Yes.  Do you want to talk about that at all? (Laughter)  On this interview?  Well, if you want to   if not, that   s fine.  Well, it was just, it was a boy   s initiation and it was pretty tough, but I  made it through. I just came in looking pretty bad, that   s all. Some of the  boys brought me home   and that was another thing, I was in there with  all these veterans, and I had zoology lab   this is getting off of Block  and Bridle, but I just think it   s something that needs to be said. I had  zoology lab from 7:00 to 9:00. My first semester up there I went from  8:00 to 5:00 to 7:00 to 9:00. I was trying to get in those eighteen hours  and had a lot of labs. I didn   t know there was anything that could ever  happened to a little girl, I mean, you know. I had to walk quite a ways  over to the Stout dorm and two big    ole boys   I mean they looked like  they were pro wrestlers or something   they came up to me at the end of  my first class. I had a class in zoology and they said,    Where do you  live?    and I told them. They said,    You don   t have a car, do you?    And  they said,    Well, you don   t have any business being on this campus by  yourself at night.    Those two fellas, I found out later they were  brothers   they were veterans   and they walked me home every night  that semester. I think they were even married guys, you know, but they  just took upon themselves, being the only girl, I did not need to be out. I  think that says something for the school and for that time and  everything. I hope it   s the same way. I don   t know.  I don   t know. I can   t answer to that.  Yeah.  I would hope so, too, but     Yeah.  Yeah, I don   t know. That   s really nice.  23  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  I mean, but that   s just the way it was up there then. It was a nice school.  Today is Saturday, November 17, 2007, and this is the second part of my  interview with Minnie Lou Ottinger Bradley, and we   re at her home in  her ranch office for the Bradley Three Ranch at Memphis, Texas   and  thank you again for letting me come and conduct the interview with you  today.  You   re stretching my memory. (Laughter)  Well, I   ll have to be a little careful about that I guess. (Laughter) Let   s  start this part of the interview and let me get your impressions when you  first went to the campus at OAMC. Did your dad take you to school and  drop you off?  Yes, my whole family went up. I had a sister that was gonna go to be a  freshman with me and then I had a younger brother and sister by quite a  few years. I remember the six of us went up there in one four-door  Chevrolet car with all of our belongings that we were gonna need, and it  was a great time. I don   t guess I   d ever been to the campus before, and  never been on a   well, Southwestern at Weatherford was just a real  small school at the time. I   d been by there because we lived right close  to Weatherford   but it was quite an experience. Probably I had no idea  what I was getting into, but it was a thrilling time. Seems as if kids from  Hydro had a habit of not being able to stay away from home or get  weaned as I call it, or whatever. They   d always come back to  Weatherford to school. As I told you earlier, before we left, my dad said,     If you   re not tough enough to make it, just keep going north.    I   ll never  forget that. He didn   t think he ever said it, but he sure did. (Laughter) He  put the fear of god in me anyway.  Was that your first time that you   d ever been on campus?  Yes.  It was?  Yeah. Yeah.  So what did you think when you saw Theta Pond and the buildings and  everything?  Well, it was a beautiful place. It was just scary. It was scary for me. Of  course, everybody walked then, or for the most part, everybody  walked   and of course we didn   t have a car either. And I remember  everybody said you can always tell a freshman by the way they look up  24  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  and around, and I thought,    That   s silly.    I   m sure that I could be  identified pretty easy the first few years.  Trying to find your way to classes and things?  Yeah. One of the funny experiences then   I don   t know how it is now     then you had to either pass swimming, girls had to pass swimming, or  have a doctor saying that they physically couldn   t swim, or you had to  take swimming lessons. I had never been in a swimming pool in my life.  I was scared death of the water, still am scared to death. And I   ll never  forget   I can still see that old green tank suit with your number across  the front and it was a long ways from that. I can   t remember that  building that had the swimming pool in it at the time. It was something I  wanted to forget really quick, but I had ag economics in the top of the  dairy building next class, and I always went into that class with those  boys with my hair just dripping, colder   sometimes I   d have ice on my  hair when I got over there. (Laughter) I thought it was gonna keep me  from graduating. I didn   t think I was ever gonna pass swimming. Of all  the science courses I took, swimming was gonna keep me from  graduating. (Laughter)  Oh goodness.  I   m sure the student union building opened that year, I   m just pretty  sure, and that was a big deal. I mean, it was just a really nice deal, and of  course I slept in the first bed on the bottom floor, can   t remember the  room number, in what we called the New Hall because they were about  a year or so later before they named it Stout Hall. It was on the end of  the campus at the time so I had to walk everywhere I went. Well, it was  a pretty good walk.  Who was your roommate?  My sis. My sis   she was sick a year in grade school, and that put us  together. One of the interesting things is then you didn   t have to take any  pre-test before you got up there. You took a test after you got there and  got enrolled. She was salutatorian of the class that I was in, and I was in  a lot of other things but I sure wasn   t in the top of the class, and I   d  depend on her a lot. She got me through class because I never was a  good student in high school. And I remember on Sunday, I would say to  myself,    Five days and I get off two.    I wanted to go to college. I  wanted to be on the judging team.  We took the test and they came to her and asked her if she would keep it  quiet and they said,    Your sister will never make it through college. Her  score was so low, we don   t think she   ll make it.    And I beat her every  25  Neurohr  Bradley  semester we were up there. I always kidded her, she was home studying  nursery rhymes. She was in child development, in elementary ed and I  was in agriculture taking all these science courses, and it always tickled  me to death because she went up there to have a good time, and I went  up there with a mission, you know, so we all laughed about that.  They were really surprised that I did as good as I did, but I had a reason.  I   ve told a lot of kids this that, you know, if you have a dream, you can  do it. It doesn   t matter if you   ve got a lot of natural abilities and a lot of  things you   re not, if you   re gonna work at it and work at it hard enough,  you can make it, and I believe that, too. So anyway   but it was a great  experience for me. And I was up there and had a great time with all  those veterans, most of them pretty serious about getting an education  but they also   they kind of ran the college two years, it was kind of fun.  Do you remember anything about who the president was or if you ever  saw the president out on campus or anything?  Two things   Dr. Bennett was killed, he was president and then got  killed in Ethiopia, I think, in a plane crash. And then Dr. Willham, who  was dean of agriculture, took over. I do know Dr. Willham because he  was the dean of agriculture when I went up there, and he had a son just a  year younger than me. That   s how I got through entomology was  Richard Willham was in the same class with me. Well, Richard helped  me get through two courses, entomology and ag economics, because I  could not see. The teachers always said in economics, it depends on the  conditions and I always thought if they had to be yes or no, but it  depended on conditions.  Richard was a real smart student and so he helped me in that. He called  me up one day in entomology and we had to have all these bugs   he  said,    Have you got them all?    And I said,    Heavens no, and some I   ve  got are twenty years old probably.    He said,    Well, dad   s president of  the college.    I said,    Yeah, I know that.    Richard said,    Well, I got  permission from the poultry guys,    said,    I went out there,    and said,     You and I are gonna raid all the poultry houses and see if we can find  the mites and the lice,    and all this kind of stuff. They had a lot of  individual hen houses at that time for experiments, and I thought, a key  in the door. We   d go in those houses and those little hens would just  squawk like everything and those guys would come out and see that it  was Richard so they   d leave us alone. (Laughter) We got all of our mites  and lice and so   yeah, I remember who the president was. (Laughs) And  the fact is, Richard went on to be a Ph.D. in genetics and started the  EPDs for the American Lung Association while he was at Iowa State.  When I was elected president of the American Angus Association, he  26  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  escorted me to the stage where he had, the night before, been inducted  into the Sirloin Club there. The other fella was a classmate of mine and  so   and he did, Dave McMann from Arkansas   but those two escorted  me up to the stage when I was elected president. So, yeah, I have a lot  of   that meant a lot to me, those two guys, yeah.  You mentioned off-camera, I think, about how your class was an  especially strong class     Right.     academically. Do you want to say anything about that on the camera  in addition to what you just said?  Well, it just seems like so many   like on my judging team, I think I   m  the only one that didn   t go ahead and get an advanced degree. And I  really haven   t kept up with those fellas. I know Jack McCroskey at one  time was in, I believe, Idaho as head of the department, at Texas Tech  and then wound up in Georgia. There were just so many of them that  went on to do good things in the field of   well, animal husbandry  mainly and beef cattle business. So, yeah, I was very pleased with a lot  of them.  You ran into them from time to time then     Oh, yeah.     over the course of your career in ranching?  I see a lot of them at the National Cattleman   s Association and all that.  That   s good. Any other memories of particular buildings on campus?  Was the Library finished and new about that time you were here?  Yes. I had English in   was it Williams Hall?   the old, old building by  the     The turrets and everything?  Yeah. I had English in that building, and of course animal science   I  mean animal husbandry, I think that building   s gone now. I think they  have a new animal science department.  I think there are some improvements in line for the agriculture building  and animal science building. They tore the dairy building down     27  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  That   s what I heard.  I don   t know if you knew that   this past year, they tore it down and so     I never took any dairy courses, but I had courses in it   ag econ in there.  Were your courses pretty much kind of in one general area of campus or  were they far away?  They were scattered from   was it Williams Hall?   Is that what they  called it?  I think Williams.  Williams Hall   from Williams Hall clear across, diagonally across the  campus, yeah. You know, I think we had ten minutes between classes or  something and sometimes I really, really had to     Had to hurry.     had to hurry to get there, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  What did you wear? What did the women wear to classes?  Most of them wore dresses, skirts. Some wore slacks part of the time and  it was according to what I was doing. If I was gonna have judging right  there in class, I   d wear slacks. You didn   t wear jeans much   just a slack  deal. Most of the girls wore skirts with anklets and, what do you call the  two-toned shoes?   the Oxfords or whatever it was   saddle oxfords?  I think so.  Yeah. A lot of things have changed. Of course, the boys    dress has  changed considerably, and I mentioned that to you earlier about all the  guys dressed so nice.  Did you have laundry facilities at Stout   that you could do your  laundry?  No, I don   t think so. Seemed like we could wash   let me see   I   ve got  to think about this   I think we could wash them. Yeah, I think we could.  Yeah. I   m pretty sure they put that in. We all had an ironing board     everybody did their own ironing at that time. So.  What was the food like?  28  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Well, of course coming from a family farm where folks raised  everything and mother didn   t do anything but cook and wash and iron  for everybody, I thought it was horrible.  Oh, you did?  But I had always had a weight problem, so I went home looking better  than I had, and my sis who roomed with me, she put on a lot of weight.  But what I really remember is eggplant. I   d never seen an eggplant, and I  haven   t eaten one of those yet. That is the awful-est looking thing I ever  saw in my life, and I never even heard of them before, but we survived.  But then there was a cafeteria in each hall, down in the basement, and I  don   t think it   s that way now, and we didn   t have any choice, I mean     You had to eat in your hall?  You ate in your hall and you ate what they put before you, which you  didn   t have any selection. You could say,    No, I don   t want that,    but  there wasn   t any choices like there are today. And what we always liked  is when they brought in the hotel and restaurant management kids. It  seemed like they fed us better then. (Laughs) And I don   t know if they  spent more money or what, but it was okay, I   m sure. And then we had a  little canteen in the bottom, in the basement, where at night at certain  hours   just certain hours   you could go get something to drink or some  cookies. So anyways, a lot stricter than   of course they were all divided  then. I don   t know if they   ve got co-ed dorms now     Yes.     at Oklahoma State or not.  They do.  Then we had some co-ed dorms, but they weren   t supposed to be. We  had guys coming through the window. (Laughs) I had some experiences  with my neighbors   those gals, they were something else. We were  supposed to keep our mouth shut, you know. They   d have panty raids  and, all that kind of stuff. I guess they still do. I don   t know.  I don   t think they do that anymore.  Oh, they don   t do that anymore? Okay.  No. No. I   ve heard about walk-outs before     Yeah.  29  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  I   ve heard some stories about walk-outs. They don   t do that anymore     but I guess that was a pretty big deal back then.  Well, with those veterans, I   ll tell you a story. Dr. Eichenberry was the  botany teacher, and he was something else anyway. Well he shut the  door when class started and this veteran didn   t quite make it from one  class to the other and he knocked on the door and Dr. Eichenberry said,     Class has started. I don   t open the door for any boy,    and he   d stuck his  fist through that thing (Laughs) and he walked in and grabbed that  professor and said,    Don   t ever shut this door on a veteran again,    and  Dr. Eichenberry left that door open from then on.  Oh my goodness.  We were always having something like that. Those veterans were   but  they   d come to your rescue, too. They were good guys but they had a  mission and they weren   t gonna take anything off anybody.  Yeah.  Of course, I was pretty wide-eyed about that time, too.  Oh, I   m sure. I would have been. (Laughter)  But there were a lot of good things, and I always admired the fact that  the campus always looked beautiful. The horticulture kids, I guess, kept  it that way. When one flower quit blooming, another one was set in the  place, and I can   t remember it being trashed or anything like that. I just  think everybody had a pride and so   of course, I guess the big hangout  was what I said   Swim   s, I believe was the name of it upstairs and had  nickel only and kids would go up there and drink Cokes and dance and  what have you, yeah. But you walked to town, you know. I   d say three-fourths  of them walked to town and go to the movies on Friday night or  Saturday night or something   and then I believe there was a theater  right across from Swim   s, too.  Leachman   s maybe? I   ve heard of a Leachman   s Theater.  I don   t remember the name, but I know there   s a theater right there. I  was thinking it was on campus, but I   m not for sure.  Well, it might have been on campus. There were more than one, I know  that.  Were there?  30  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Yeah, I think there was more than one theater in town.  Yeah, yeah. There was one downtown and I don   t remember the name of  it, but that was a Friday night because you didn   t want to be out that late,  you know. Of course then, you had hours   freshmen and sophomores  had to be in by eight o   clock. And juniors   Friday nights, seemed like it  was eleven o   clock, maybe twelve o   clock on Saturday night, I   m not for  sure.  Do you remember being around the house mom? Was she an imposing  figure in the house and did people   was she kind of a mother figure or  was she more of a disciplinarian-type figure or     Well, I think it was according to the girls. (Laughter) When she   d come  down the hall and said,    Open those doors.    I always got along with her  because the boys I went with were all in agriculture, and most of them  very, very polite, and I could be ten minutes late anyways   okay     another girl could be ten minutes late and it wasn   t because these boys  took off their hats and swept the floor      How are you Ms. Green,    I  believe, was her name. Yeah,    How are you?    blah, blah, blah, you  know and she just thought those were the greatest guys in the world. So  she was   just like you are   whether she wanted to be lenient or not, she  realized because she leaned toward the people that was polite. But, yeah,  they gave us instructions then   if you were gonna sit on a boy   s lap in a  car when we had to double-up   I forget what we had to have between  us, (Laughter) and a whole bunch of little things like that, that kids today  would say,    Oh, my gosh, that   s crazy.     Well, that was the time, I guess.  That was the time, and it wasn   t all bad.  No.  Wasn   t all bad. I guess the worst hail storm that ever hit Stillwater  maybe was up there my freshman year.  Oh, do you remember that?  Oh, yeah. It shattered all those tile roofs they had then, they had all tile  roofs on every building   it shattered everything. I mean, it just came  down. Convertibles were real popular then and we   d look out the  window and, oh, those convertibles were just beat to pieces. Of course,  those kids were really looked upon as something special if they had a  car   but, yeah, I remember. That was, I mean every building up there  got   and those tiles weren   t as big as a pebble when it got through   and  31  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  if you was outside   you go outside, you got beat pretty bad.  How big was the hail?  Oh, it was big, you know.  Big softball size?  Yeah, but it was just so hard and so much of it   yeah.  Have you ever seen any hail like that since then?  No, not that bad. I   ve been through some hail storms, but that was the  worst. And the worst damage I ever saw.  Yeah, at winter-time, any bad winter storms that you remember?  No, not real bad. We had some storms, but not real bad. You just put on  more clothes and went to class. I can   t remember them ever calling off a  class, so     What about any campus traditions that you remember? Homecoming?  You were really busy with your studies and the livestock judging and so  did you participate in any of those other types of activities at all?  Well, not a whole lot. I went to the home games. I never did   see, the  little town I came from never had a football team, so I really didn   t even  know what football was all about. Basketball, I got pretty involved with  that.  Did you play basketball growing up?  In high school.  In high school?  Yeah. Yeah. And I still love girls    basketball. Then it was a half court  deal where you had six girls on a team, three on each end and all that,  but I remember we   OSU, and I was there, played Drake University and  they had the first black person, and that got to be a little nasty. I think  now how times have changed.  That was an unfortunate incident     Yes it was.  32  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr     in OSU   s sports history.  Yes. Yes, I remember.  And people still acknowledge that, and apologies were made and   but,  you know   yeah, it   s one of those things. Sometimes the students don   t  realize the impact of actions that they take at the time.  I was at that game.  Oh, were you?  Yes. Yes.  Did you see that incident happen?  Yes, and I thought it was awful.  Yeah.  Yeah. I thought it was awful. I never had been around   you know at  Hydro, it was all just white people   so I had no bias or anything. But I  couldn   t   you know, he was a human being, and so     Were there any international students that you were around at all?  Well, I kind of thought those from New York were international.  (Laughs) I took one home with me once, and that didn   t go too good.  (Laughter) No, there were quite a few Ethiopians. There were, yeah,  there was quite a few at that time, nothing like today. As I recall, Dr.  Bennett was working pretty close with Ethiopians at that time so there  were several of those.  There was a program called the    Four Points Program    that he was  leading, and it was to try to establish international relations, and  Ethiopia was one of the countries that they worked very strongly with.  I remember that, and I remember they came, because they dressed a little  differently and all that, and of course then   but we had a lot of  Indians   of course Oklahoma would have     Yes.     and I had some in my classes     But you didn   t really think anything about it?  33  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  No. No. No. Well, they had more money than any of the rest of us.  Oh, did they? (Laughter)  Yeah, some of them.  Yes. Yes.  Yeah. Yeah.  Well, their student organization started in 1930 at OSU   the Indian  student organization did.  Oh, is that right?  I came across that in a yearbook recently, and I think that   s a really  interesting part of OSU   s history.  The only ones I was really associated with were in the rodeo club. They  were pretty big in that, so anyways   but things have changed a lot, so     Oh, yeah. You talked a little bit about the professors that you had in  classes and with the livestock judging and animal husbandry. Do you  have any other stories about faculty that were particularly supportive  that we haven   t already told or who might have influenced you at all in  that way?  Well, there was a lady, and I can   t recall her name. I had English under  her. We had to write themes and I never have learned how to diagram a  sentence. When I was in high school, I thought that was the biggest  waste of time. I could figure out, you know. I thought that was the  most    Well, I probably couldn   t spell too good either and I thought,     How am I gonna get out of this class?    And another    ole boy, he had  had some problems the year before and he really liked me. He said,    I   m  gonna tell you, he   she likes the cowboys   ,    and said       if you put  quotes around everything, she can   t say anything about your spelling and  everything       (Laughs) So I learned to put all these quotes in every. She  came to me one day and she said,    You think all these quotes are  just   ,    but anyway, she worked, and I did find out that writing for  English and writing   I did pretty good in journalism because it was two  different things, I mean, it really   you write differently. But I remember  that she helped me there. Of course then I mentioned earlier the  chemistry teacher who bent over backwards to help me, and I   ll say all  my animal science teachers did. I had a professor in ag engineering and  what I know about an engine, I don   t know anything. But Mr. Dilks I  believe was his name, and he had a cane and he   d whack you if you read  34  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  the O   Colly while you were in class. (Laughter) He split many a paper  right down the middle. (Laughter) And I had a difficult time in there  with just not knowing anything. But he was very nice to me   oh Lord,  he scared more boys to death. I mean, you didn   t dare open that   you  couldn   t have made me open that O   Colly up in his class. But, yeah, all  the   I would say, all the animal science people were really supportive of  me. I think they knew I was trying   maybe that was the reason, I don   t  know, but     Were you usually the only female in your classes?  I was, yes. They had some trouble   they were used to all boys and then  men did not speak bolder or cuss or anything in front of women, and  every once in awhile they   d let something slip and that would embarrass  them a lot more than it did me, you know. They would apologize and  apologize, and I   d say,    Wait a minute. I   m just another boy in this class.  Don   t,    you know, but I appreciated that, you know. It embarrassed  me   it embarrassed them when they   d do it. But they were so apologetic  and they said,    We   re just not used to this.    I know I put them under a  lot of strain in lots of ways, you know. They had to watch what they  were doing but later on I think they were all kind of proud of what I   d  achieved maybe.  I   m sure they were. So by your senior year, were there any other women  that were coming into the programs at all?  Yeah, there were two girls from Michigan that transferred from  Michigan. Well, and one was in agriculture in animal science, and over  there was two or three that started, but they didn   t last too long. I was the  only one that started and ended it, I guess. (Laughs)  Finished. This kind of leads me into just mentioning your involvement  with ranch management students. Over the years you   ve had a long  involvement of working with college students in a ranch management  program from TCU, and just   if you   d talk a little bit about that, you  must enjoy that experience of working with those students and     Well, I really do. We   ve just had them out here for the 52nd year. The  TCU ranch management. Clarendon College ranch management comes  on a periodic basis, and West Texas will bring their kids once in  awhile   Vernon College. We   ve had Colorado. Some of them stop in  going to Fort Worth and different places. The two colleges mainly that  we   ve worked with through the years is Clarendon and TCU. I   m very  proud of our association with TCU. We   ve seen a lot of those boys come  through and now I   m seeing the grandsons come through. But we and  one other ranch in south Texas are the only ones that   s had them for  35  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  every year they   ve been in existence. I   ve seen the professors change  and all that. It   s a great program, and we do enjoy it. We probably learn  as much from having these kids as they learn from us. I think they keep  you on your feet, keep wanting you to do better, you know, so we enjoy  it, working with the young people. That   s a high class bunch of boys that  come through here.  Are most of them from family ranch backgrounds?  I would say they have some connection, for the most part   I mean,  either grandma, grandpa, aunt, uncle, somebody. Not all, but for the  most part, yes. Most of them have a college education when they go to  that class, so they   re ready to   you know, they   re getting serious about  learning and very bright. Most of them will have a degree in   either a  law degree or a business degree, finance   something like that. So  they   re very knowledgeable and it gives me hope for the future that they  still want to do this and most of them are probably gonna make more  money in other places, but they still have that desire.  A lot of them were raised in cities, but their folks owned ranches, and I  think what I failed to see   and I   m sure if I had to do it over again at  seventeen going to college, I   d probably do it like I did it, but it was  wrong   all I wanted to do was production   beef cattle production. And  we didn   t have a course in finance. We didn   t have a course in,    What   s  it cost?    It was, you feed them this much to make them grow or you do  this and this, but there wasn   t anything to say how are you gonna make a  buck? How are you gonna make a buck? And so I had to learn all that  when I got out. Now they do have   see then, and that was before they  even had ag business majors, and now surely they   re teaching some of  that along with animal science and in production agriculture because  there   s so much more to it than production. It   s marketing. I still think  most of them are pretty slacking   the colleges are pretty slacking in  marketing.  In marketing?  Yeah, if you say marketing, they all think of the futures and options and  all that. Well, there   s more to it than that.  Well, like your web page, for instance.  Yeah, right. Yeah.  Your newsletters.  Of course then, there wasn   t the web. (Laughter)  36  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  No, there wasn   t. (Laughter)  I tell you, there was one computer up at OSU when I went up there.  Oh there was?  Yes, and it was   the whole basement of the home economics building.  (Laughter) And that was it. It was kind of a punch card     Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and you was always sitting there scratching this little deal and  scratching.  So you had to go down there and use that?  Well, no, the cards would be set up to whatever they needed it for. But  that was, as far as I know the only computer, and it must have been a  humongous one.  I bet it was. I bet it was hot down there, too. (Laughter)  Well, very few had personal typewriters, and we didn   t have phones. I  mean, you had a phone on each wing. I think today kids are on the phone  all the time, you know.  Did students have bicycles on campus to get around?  Yeah, some of them had bicycles, yeah, sure did. There were more  bicycles than there were cars probably. (Laughter) Yeah.  I want to ask you about when you won your award at Chicago and I  guess after you came back, you were named by Governor Johnston  Murray to the Honorary Colonel   s Staff. Explain that.  Well, actually there wasn   t any ceremony or anything. I got a certificate,  but I still have the old crumbled thing naming me an honorary colonel,  yeah.  Oh, okay   and was there one other person named besides yourself?  I have no idea.  Did they mail that to you or did somebody     Yeah.  37  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  They did? Oh, okay. That   s neat, yeah.  There   s a lot of things that happened during that time. I look back now  and I don   t know that I thought a lot of it at the time. But, Hydro turned  out for me for a big celebration. Anadarko, the county seat, they had a  big deal and different ones, you know, and     While you were still in college?  Yeah. Yeah. So     Did they ask you to speak?  Yes.  They did?  Yeah, and I wasn   t a speaker. In fact, I never made a talk until I was 55.  I wouldn   t, I escaped. I don   t know exactly how I escaped, but I escaped  public speaking in high school and public speaking in college. Now I  could get that one-on-one and give my reasons, but I wasn   t about to get  up and make a speech anywhere. Now I guess I   m maybe in about 20-  some odd states or so, but I remember very well, I was 55 and my kids  of course gone. At that time, we had a little old tin building for an office  out here, and I was out there and folks from California called me and  asked me if I   d come out there and give a talk on Brangus cattle. I told  him I didn   t do those things. He said,    Well, you   re on the board of  International Brangus.    I said,    I know. I can talk one-on-one, but  not       And for some reason, I guess the good Lord speaks to you in  different ways   I went in the house and sat down in an old cane bottom  rocking chair and was rocking (Laughter) and I thought,    Is this your life  now?    I thought,    Man, I don   t want this to be my life in a cane bottom  rocking chair.    I   m not a very big TV fan, and so I went back out there  and called him and I said,    If you   ve got the guts to ask me, I   ll just try  to get the guts to give it.     I flew out there and that was my first one. I   m okay if I   m talking about  cattle, I feel pretty good about that but I always tell kids   that   s one  thing I tell them all is to   well, I tell them two things if I don   t tell them  anything else   to be able to communicate with people and if it   s   no,  it   s mainly boys still or young men that we have here. There are some  girls, and it doesn   t matter. I said,    Whoever you marry, be sure they  want to live on the ranch because   ,    I said,       you know, you fall in  love and you think everything will be rosy and you   re fifty miles from  town and she wants to live in town and you   re supposed to be running a  ranch out there.    I said,    It ain   t gonna work.    I said,    You   ve gotta find  38  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  out what they like,    and they all look at me like,    Well, you gotta be  kidding,    but I know several that have moved to town and that   s  important and so     That   s good advice.  Well, you know, they don   t take it. I mean, you fall in love with  whoever and all of that kind of stuff I guess, but you can   t run a ranch  and not live on it, I don   t think. I know you can   t with  3.00 gas.  (Laughter)  Good point. (Laughs) You told us a story over lunch about the trophy,  the National Merit Trophy Award. Is that the story you were telling me  about? The big livestock animal trophy, big bronze trophy?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, if you wouldn   t mind telling that story, I thought that was an  interesting one.  Well, now it   s at Louisville, Kentucky. It   s still the International  Livestock Show, but then it was in Chicago. When they tore down the  stockyards, why Chicago show had to move and Louisville got it. But  each year at the collegiate judging contest, whatever team wins it is  awarded this big traveling bronze bull, and he   s a heavy outfit, too. And  if you win it three times, then you get to keep it. Oklahoma State had  won it three times and it was right in the center of the trophies and  everything that we had up there, and that   s what we all looked to   we  gotta do this again. One night the engineering students got in there, they  stole our bull, castrated him and brought him back to us, and that caused  quite a rile on campus I want to tell you. I don   t suppose that the  engineering students and the animal husbandry students talked to each  other till this day probably over that. (Laughs) I don   t know what   s  happened in all these years, but that caused   I mean, that was serious.  Oh, sure.  And it was, it was serious, and it   s vandalism.  Yes. Yes.  I   m sure those guys thought it was a big joke, but it wasn   t a big joke to  us.  No.  39  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  It wasn   t a big joke, but I can still see that bronze bull. He was a  beautiful thing. He was a   oh, I don   t know   he had horns, I know that.  The way he was positioned and everything, you know, he was a massive  thing. But he came back a steer.  So was it repaired? What happened?  You know, I don   t know that they ever got him repaired.  No? (Laughter)  Hopefully in all these years, Oklahoma State   s won two or three more.  Well, I hope so. (Laughter) So were you on the team that won that one  that that happened to?  No, no, that happened before and we didn   t win. Our team was second  that year. I happened to be top individual, but our team was second.  Did you get a trophy being top individual, or a plaque or something?  I got some plaques   it   s really funny. I   ll show you one here in a  minute. Somebody asked me about and I said,    Well, it   s like something  that ought to be buried with me,    but now they get big buckles and all  that. I got several things like   oh, well, one of the big packing  companies   Mr. Wilson   Wilson Company, I think   at that time, they  had a plant in Oklahoma City. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson presented me with  some things and I think that was at Kansas City and different things. The  awards have all changed up now, but anyways I was tickled when I got  them, I   ll tell you.  Oh, I bet. In 1988, the OSU department of animal science honored you  with a Graduate of Distinction award. Could you tell me a little bit  about that experience? And did you go back to Stillwater for that?  Oh, that was     What was that like?  I guess that was one of the big surprises I   ve had when they called and  told me that I   d been named. And I don   t know what process they go  through or anything about it. Dr. Totusek was head of the department at  the time, and I   d met Dr. Totusek. He was about to graduate to get his  doctorate degree at Purdue, I believe it was, when we were on our way  to Chicago. We stopped there to practice on the way to Chicago that  year. He   s not that much older than I am, but he was really fast in getting  40  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  his education and he came back to OSU that next year. It wasn   t long  before he was head of the department. But anyway, it was a real honor  for me that night to stand up there and receive that award. It really was,  and I   m proud of it, too. You see it? It   s hanging in my office.  It   s hanging in your office on the wall right back over there, yes. You   ve  won a lot of other awards. Are there others that are especially  meaningful to you?  Yeah, I   ve been really, really fortunate in a lot of things. I   ve got one  that I   m going for that we haven   t got yet but we   re on our way. We  were named the Land Stewardship and Environmental Award winner for  Texas just recently, and it will be submitted for the national honor. You  know, I always said I   d never have a big ranch. I just wanted to make it  the best and have it stocked with the best cattle, and we   re kind of  getting there in some ways. A few years ago, I was named the Pioneer  Breeder for Improvement   Beef Cattle Improvement Association   and  I   ve just had several things. Governor Bush at that time presented me  with a Wildlife and Environmental Spirit Award. Then last year inducted  into the Cowboy Hall of Fame and that was a tremendous deal which I  never considered myself a cowgirl.  You didn   t?  No, no   I considered myself a beef cattle person.  Well, how   s that different in your mind?  I always thought   well, I knew they didn   t   they took in other people  than just the rodeo cowgirls, but to go up there and stand beside Sandra  Day O   Connor and who I used to go pay my dime to see Dale Evans  every Saturday night, and some of those. That was a tremendous honor.  And then being elected president of the American Angus Association  was something I never intended to even happen. I mean, even after I got  on the board, I just didn   t think that was the place. For the men to go  ahead and move me up, it made me feel good. So I   ve had a lot of nice  things. Really been   really fortunate.  Was it difficult to accept those leadership roles when they were  presented to you? Or were they presented to you at times when you were  ready to be the leader of them?  Well, I enjoyed   and I hope I contributed a little bit on the board, the  American Angus board. I was in there during a really good time in the  Angus Association. We were growing so and number one in the nation  and all that. I had told them I had been the oldest president. I was the  41  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  furthest away from the airport.  Did you have to travel a lot for that role?  I didn   t travel as much as a lot of them do. They told me if I   d take it,  they wouldn   t make me go a lot of places that a lot of them go to, but I   d  go up to Oklahoma City most of the time to catch the plane. It was just  easier to fly.  And that   s three hours or more?  Yeah. So   but situations popped up and they kept saying,    It   s your  time,    and so it did make me feel good. I set some different rules when I  went in and they   ve all kidded me about some of those rules but they  said,    Remember what you said now?    They told me just last week  when I was at the meeting,    Remember what you said?    So I thought  they honored me pretty much and I hope I made a good leader. We  didn   t get everything done I wanted to get done, but it   s happened since.  That   s good.  Sometimes it just takes time but it was a great experience. It just seems  like a lot of things have happened that have been pretty nice for me so     Well, you   ve blazed the trail. (Laughter)  Well, I don   t know about that. I never really felt that way. I just love  what I do. I mean, I feel so fortunate to be able to carry out my dreams,  to have a little place out here and   you know, I   ve had a lot of help. My  husband   s family, of course, helped us get started and some of those  things I just hope that my father-in-law and grandfather-in-law know  that I   m getting them done.  So you still don   t feel like you blazed the trail necessarily?  No, I don   t. I just think I did what I wanted to do, and I think I   m really  lucky to be able to do that. Now, I can tell a lot of funny stories about  things out here. Somebody said,    You can   t have registered cattle and  not have a gravel pit, oil well or another job or something,    and I guess  that   s one thing that makes me feel good. We did all this with cattle in  kind of a harsh kind of country they say, but my needs aren   t really great  personally. (Laughs) I had a good family and a daughter now that   s led  us into the   well, we went into the meat business. I get a lot of credit for  that, establishing a lot of things that way. We got to feed the President of  the United States and that was one of the greatest honors we were asked  to do. We had to go through a lot of hoops to get there, but it was pretty  42  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  nice for a little company as small as we were to win the battle when you  had to go through a lot of taste contests and     For what event did you feed     President Bush   s first inaugural.  His first inaugural? Oh. That   s something.  They called us up   Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison called us up and said,     We   re gonna have a dinner, a big dinner, what we call the Texas Black-  Tie Boot.    She said,    We know you have that little company out there  and would you like to try to be       We thought about it and said we   d  try. And so we had to send a whole rib-eye up to this hotel. I guess we  sent about six or eight because you had to win. The first one you sent up  they said,    Well, you won the taste, but can you repeat it?    So we   d send  another one and finally we said,    Are you guys just enjoying eating that  meat or what?    (Laughter) But anyway, then they called us and said,     Can you feed 500?    and it wound up being 1,000.  Wow.  My daughter and her husband got to fly up there and be right with the  President and everything     Well, how nice.     so it was a great honor.  Yes.  So this probably goes down as probably one of the biggest things we   ve  got to do. And we were the sole supplier of CAB all-natural beef as long  as we were in business and so we   ve had just a great run. That   s all I can  say.  Have you, in all of your years of experience being on livestock judging  teams, did you ever take the other role and be a judge?  When I first got out of college, I judged a few and I decided that wasn   t  my cup of tea. I just didn   t care for it. In fact, I was going away from  liking livestock shows because I got to thinking they   re kind of artificial.  (Laughs) And in the position I held at that time, working for an  association, I thought,    You know, this is not a good thing,    because  you   re gonna make somebody mad.  43  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Little bit   yeah, conflict of interest or whatever.  Yeah.  People could perceive that.  Then after I moved out here, I just said,    No, no, no.    Now a lot of  people really   I mean I know of several young girls   not several   a  few young girls   well, they   re not so young anymore, but young ladies  that judge quite a few cattle shows and they really like it, but I just never  cared to do that.  Did you ever talk to students about the experience of it, to try to give  them tips or anything?  Well, I tell them all that I think it   s one of the greatest experiences. I  think it teaches so much. Well, a lot of these fellas I know today were all  on the judging teams, K-State and Ohio and different places. The people  you meet, the confidence you build up in yourself, and to make  decisions, and have to stand by them and, you have to give your reasons  why you stood by them. And so, I tell them it   s good experience. I  always admire kids because it takes something out of your life. You   re  not gonna run around every night and have a good time with a judging  team. I encourage it because most of the students we have out here are  not even in where they have judging teams. They   re just in management.  Did you do a lot of horseback early on in ranching?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of horseback?  I did practically all the riding, checking pastures and everything, for  about the first twenty-five years while my husband was building fences  and this, this and this, and then we didn   t take trailers. I   d start out here  and take me a little lunch and a canteen of water and stay gone all day.  Now it   s so much easier, we load up a trailer and go. Then we have our  pastures cut up a lot more now. But, yeah, I really enjoyed that and I still  say you can   t see a cow as good as you can horseback. I mean, when  you   re riding and watching that    ole cow for about a two-mile drive or  something and you   re looking down over her top and all and seeing how  she   s walking and all, that   s probably the best way. Now I   ve got me a  four-wheel mule, you know. (Laughter) When my knees gave way, why  I gave up riding, but I still miss it. I wouldn   t say I was a great  horseback rider, but as far as cowboy-in and all that.  44  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Did you rope?  No, I didn   t rope.  I never learned to rope either.  I never did learn to rope. Now my kids could. My husband was a good  roper and my daughter was a district champion in roping. But I never  did, so     Well, this has been a great interview. We   ve just learned a lot about  your experiences and I guess in a way I   m a little surprised that there  weren   t more hardships when you were coming in. You told me about  some and maybe there   s some you don   t want to talk about, but I  expected it to just be a battle all along, while you were in school through  the years and from what you   ve told me today, you didn   t really see it  that way so much. You told me about some little things that happened,  but you didn   t feel like it was a huge struggle. Am I right on that?  Well, that   s kind of like when we went in the meat business. Everybody  said,    It can   t be done. You   re gonna lose the ranch and everything.     Almost did, but I   ve always said I wasn   t smart enough to recognize the  bad problems but I can   t say that   I   ve heard people say they thought  this person treated this, this and I just didn   t see that. The first thing I  tried to be was   a lot of people get the wrong idea. If you   re gonna be in  the cattle business and you   re a woman, you got to be a tough    ole so-and-  so and kind of crude and all. I always wanted to be a lady along  with it, and that   s the way it was. I always got treated like a lady and I  kind of think that was it. I think I didn   t go where they want to go.  Was that from your upbringing?  I imagine, because my mother told me that girls didn   t cross their legs at  the knees, they crossed them at the ankles and girls didn   t sweat. The  first time I said something about sweating, oh my goodness, she came  apart at the seams, and she said,    Ladies don   t sweat. They perspire.     It   s funny, things, how you remember some of those things sixty and  seventy years later. (Laughter) But, yeah, I was raised to be a lady in a  man   s environment. I mean, I   m not saying I wanted to be treated like a  daisy or something, I don   t mean that. I   m just saying that whatever the  deal was, I could be there and I could match you, but I wanted to be a  lady about it. I   ve had a lot of ladies that think they get mistreated and  politics   whatever. I say,    No, if you   re as smart as that man and know  your business as well, whatever it is you   ll be treated okay.    I believe  that   and, like I say, I   m not too smart so I may have been run over and  didn   t know it. I don   t know (Laughs)  45  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Do you have a competitive streak? What do you think?  Well, yeah. I   ve been accused of that.  That   s okay.  But I don   t think   and I have a hard time with people that aren   t  competitive. I really do. I don   t belong   I   m not saying this to sound  mean or bad or whatever, but I don   t belong to any ladies clubs, and I   m  sure there   s some really good ones that I could learn a lot from, but from  the few I   ve been exposed to, they   re just not my cup of tea I   d say.  They don   t discuss the things that I like to discuss, and I guess I am a  little too much that way. I can   t think of anything worse than belonging  to a quilting club or something like that. People keep asking me,    When  are you gonna move to town?    And I said,    When they come out here  and carry me out.    I don   t plan to. Now something might happen, but  I   ve still got a lot of things to do out here and I think I   m still able to do  some things.  Have you had any kind of network of other women like yourself that  you   ve been friends with over the years at all?  Not really. Not probably as close as I should have because I get to  thinking I don   t really have any friend (Laughs)   close   I have a lot of  friends.  Well, it   s hard when you   re in a remote location for one thing, but     Yeah, that   s true but I   ve had a lot of ladies   and I told them I   d do it  this year. I don   t know if I   ll get it done or not but they want me to kind  of have a class for them. There are a lot of ladies they own more land  than men do today, I think.  Really?  Yes. There   s more land owned by ladies than there are   and I didn   t  realize, see, I don   t think like them and they don   t feel good about   they  don   t feel confident and everything in business. And they want me to  have some classes just to sit down and give them some little   oh, just  ideas, how you keep your business and about buying bulls and keeping  records on their calves and all this. I   ve promised them for several years.  I guess I   m gonna have to do it one of these days.  They want to tap into some of your knowledge.  Well, I love to share it and sometimes I think,    My Lord, some of those  46  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  are such big operations,    and I have such a little operation, why would  they ask me? But maybe that intrigues them, too, that we   ve been able to  make it as a smaller operation without any assistance.  That   s interesting. Is there any other quick thing you want to add?  Lord have mercy, I   ve told you too much now.  Oh, no. This has been great. Well, I really appreciate it. Thank you so  much.  Well, you   re more than welcome.  It   s an honor really.  Well, I   ve enjoyed it.  Well, thank you.  I   m honored that Oklahoma A M   Oklahoma State would even  consider me. Mary Lou, my daughter, asked me the other day, said     What are they gonna do?    And I said,    This is going in the archives I  think,    and she said,    Oh, my Lord.    I said,    That   s what I think, too.     (Laughter) But you know, she sees now   she majored in accounting,  and realized right quick she probably didn   t want to go into accounting  and I think she sees now going to a larger university and really getting  involved in whatever you was in, how much it means. Like she   s always  said,    I can   t believe you know all these people.    (Laughter So  anyways. But OSU is a good school.  One of the things that was how you were able to pay for school when  you went to Oklahoma A M College.  That   s right. I had a little herd of Angus cows and some Hampshire  hogs, and my daddy said,    You   re gonna have to sell them if you   re  gonna go to school,    because   well, really if my other brother and  sisters had as much as I had, he wouldn   t have anything left. So I sold  them for  4,000 dollars. I thought I was probably the wealthiest person  in Oklahoma at that time, and it put me through four years of college up  there, but no extras. That paid my room and board and all my tuition  while I was up there    4,000 dollars. Now I hear it   s several thousand a  semester.  Yes.  And it   s just hard for me to think about that.  47  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Bradley  Neurohr  Did you work in the summertime? How did you spend your summers?  Back on the farm, helping my dad. Then the one year when they had that  horrible wreck between my junior and senior year   had a car wreck   it  took mainly my sis and I both, we   d had nurses around the clock and we  took over then and that   s when I learned to cook. My sis said,    You   ve  got to learn.    I was always outside with my dad, but I had to learn to  cook a little bit that year so she could have a day off. (Laughs) But other  than that, why I helped my dad.  You had a recollection or a memory, I guess, about the rodeo team when  that happened with your parents   and I don   t think we got that on tape,  so if you wanted to mention that.  Well, the rodeo team was kind of set aside from Block and Bridle   kind  of a classification thing you might say. Some of them were a little rodeo-ish,  to put it mildly. But when my folks had that awful wreck, I   ll never  forget the rodeo team. Some of the members of the rodeo team came up  and said,    Now what needs to be done out at your place? We   ll go out  there and we   ll do whatever needs to be done, whether it   s a weekend  during school or whatever   we   ll get it done for you.    And I really  wasn   t close to rodeo guys, but that always stayed in my heart that those  guys came through just because they knew I needed some help, and they  did come out one time, and that   s the only time I really needed them.  The boy I was going with and then married, he was on the rodeo team,  or part of it, and so he and I went out there and kept things kind of  going. But I   ve always had a big place in my heart for a bunch of those     ole boys that I thought were pretty tough but when you needed them,  they were there for you.  That   s good.  -------  -------
