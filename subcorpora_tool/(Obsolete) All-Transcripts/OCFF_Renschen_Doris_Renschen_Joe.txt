 Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn and with me is Tanya Finchum. We   re  with the Oklahoma State University Library. We   re here in Lawton,  Oklahoma, today, to interview Joe and Doris Renschen. It   s March 9,  2012, and we   re here, today, to talk about their centennial farm. Thank  you for joining us today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s begin by learning a little bit more about your family. How did your  family come to settle on this piece of land?  Well, I guess I married into the family. (Laughs) My mother-in-law   s  folks kind of homesteaded this. Actually, he wasn   t drawn. He and a  friend had come from Illinois to try to get land down here. He wasn   t  drawn in the drawing, but the friend was. The guy that got it didn   t  really want to live here, but my husband   s granddad did. So, they made a  deal that, at that time, the one that drew it had to live on the land for a  year and then they could sell it or whatever. The guy lived in a dugout  right out here in the yard. You can probably still see it. I can still find  where the dugout was. They filled it in with dirt, of course. I think he  filled it in years ago.  Anyway, the guy lived in the dugout for a year and then my husband   s  grandparents bought the farm. We used to have pictures somewhere. At  that time, the grass was so tall. You could see a man   s hat and he was on  a horse and that was how tall the grass was. You could not even see the  man   s face. You could see the top of his hat, and Grandma always said  that was one of her first boyfriends, that lived down the road. They were  about four or five years old. (Laughs) Anyway, this little boy was with  his dad on the horse, but you couldn   t see the little kid. (Laughs)  Anyway, that   s how I got involved with it, was marrying into the family.  What was your husband   s grandparents    names?  5  D. Renschen   His mother   s parents were Henry and Margaretha  Ehlman.  His father  was raised by an uncle, Henry Renschen .  His mother,  Emma Ehlman,  had three brothers and a sister, and the sister lived across the road. Her  name was Helen and Grandma   s was Dorothy. One of the brothers,  Herman, lived over here. John used to live down east, the house is gone.  Then Clarence, another brother, wandered on back to Illinois. That   s  where they had originally came from. But the grandma and the grandpa  originally were from Germany. They were German. They originally  came from Germany and settled in Illinois and then came on down here  when Oklahoma opened.  Anyway, after a year of living in a tent in the area here somewhere     Grandma couldn   t remember just where, but it was on the perimeter  somewhere here   they brought three trainloads of things from Illinois.  One was a load of cattle and one was vegetables, machinery, plows,  what have you, and then household furniture. Most of the furniture is  still here. (Laughs) Anyway, Grandma used to tell about them walking.  She was a little bitty kid and she   d get tangled up in the grass and stuff.  Anyway, they drove the cattle. The train came to Duncan. There was a  station at Duncan at that time. The train stopped at Duncan, and they had  to haul everything they   d brought down with them. They had to haul it  to the area. So, she told of her and her sister and her momma having to  go help. The boys were older, and these girls were the youngest. She  was the baby. She, by then, was about four or five years old, how she   d  get all tangled up in the big grass because they all had to go help drive  cattle from Duncan to here, and how her dad would throw her up on a  horse. Some of the guys would be riding horses and how they   d take  turns riding horses. She got to ride on the horse most of the time because  they had all that distance. (Laughs) It   s not a real long ways to Duncan,  but it   s quite a ways.  Anyway, they drove all their cattle here. At that time, of course, there  were no fences. They were laying the land off and we have the baseline  a mile up here. If you notice   if you came from that way, you notice  you come to a dead end and you make a little jog and you have to go  back. That   s the baseline, it goes clear across Oklahoma. They surveyed  from one end of Oklahoma to the other. When they met, that   s how  much. Now, this was back in the early 1900s. You have something  surveyed today, if you sell it, it   ll have to be surveyed again and they  won   t come out with the same survey. So, they didn   t do too bad a job of  surveying back early, then. But that   s what the baseline is, is from  surveying Oklahoma from one end to the other. They were off that  much. But if you drive it, you can   t get through the baseline clear across  Oklahoma, but you can follow it by zigzagging, and we have followed it  a long ways. (Laughs)  6  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen   Daughter Tonia Renschen joins in the interview   Yes, I did a lot of driving in that area.  You can, it does go clear across Oklahoma.  Yes, it had a lot of pastures, a lot of fences, and a lot of roads.  Yes, we   d run into a few fences. You didn   t run into the fence, but you   d  come to a dead end and you   d think it was a road. (Laughs)  You   d do like this or like this. (Gestures) I did a lot of driving back with  Daddy and Mom.  My husband liked to check out things. A lot of times that was our  vacation, weekend vacation, was just to go driving and see what  Oklahoma has to offer.  He let me do all the driving. He   d keep an eye on my seizures, in case I  had a seizure driving. I loved that area.  Anyway, that   s why that   s called baseline. After they finally got the  place in their name, then the man, his grandpa was      Joe Renschen joins in the interview   Constable, judge     Justice of the Peace?  Well, no, he was   shoot, I went blank.  Yes, what   d they call it? He was a lawyer     The paperwork said Justice of the Peace.  He was a judge. Okay, he later became one of the first judges in this  area, but when they first came, he was a     Lawyer or attorney?  Yes, in that area, maybe I   ll think of it. It   s in that red book. Anyway, I  can   t think of what   district attorney? No. Shoot, I   m blank. Anyway,  they built this house and they made all the stones in the house. They  hauled the sand out of Cash Creek, which is three or four miles on west  7  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  of here and made every stone in this house, here on the ground area. We  used to have the mold. I   ve seen the mold. They had two molds and  made every stone. (Laughs) It would take four to five days, depending  on the weather, for each block. You   ll see how big the blocks are.  They   re that thick, right there, you can tell by that doorway. (Gestures)  That   s how thick the stone blocks are that the house is made of. It took a  good little while for them to dry.  Each one has a pattern on it. It   s not just like a cement block. If you look  at them, you can see it   s   well, they called it a feather. Grandpa always  called it a feather design. But every block has a pattern on it. It   s not just  a cement block. So, it took them about a year to make enough blocks to  build this house. I used to have a picture, but I   ve looked and I can   t find  it of the big stacks of blocks that they would have lined up out here in  the front yard. Those elm trees, there was four, there used to be four of  them. They were little, maybe four foot tall, and these big stacks of  blocks that would be much taller. So, those trees have been out there a  long time. Two of them are still there, but two of them died years ago,  after a storm had hit them and what have you. But those are old trees and  they look old. (Laughs)  In the original house, how many rooms?  It has three bedrooms and an area room upstairs and two bedrooms  downstairs and a front room, they called it the parlor. They used that for  a dining room, and then the kitchen.  Pretty big house for that time.  Yes, it was a big house. It had a porch all the way around from the  front   oh, well, not all the way, but all across the front and here on the  west side. The house was not modern and there was a window here. If  you   ll look in there, you   ll see where we made the gun cabinet out of the  window that looked out on the porch right here on this west wall. We  made a gun cabinet out of that because it looks right into the bathtub.  (Laughs) This was the end of the   here, this went outside. Just like that  little porch, this was a little porch here and it went outside. It was not a  room. There was a door here that went into the washroom, and that was  not a door there. I mean, that was solid wall there because you went  outside.  When we had to make it a little more modern, we built a room on down,  made a utility and a bath down there and made this into a usable  bathroom. That was always called the men   s bathroom because it   s just a  lavatory and commode in there, and they can come in from the field or  whatever and wash up before they come in to eat. That one down there  8  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  used to have a tub and everything, but after my husband got sick, we had  the tub taken out and the handicap shower   made it handicap accessible.  We had to close up windows.  When Grandma was there, bless her heart she was the sweetest lady,  she   d been here all her life. She came when she was two years old     three years old because it was a year and then they moved their stuff  here when she was four. That was when they did all the pacing back and  forth. She   d been here all of her life. We had to close this window up,  and we had to do something with that one in there because it looked  right out into the tub. It just really upset her. We closed them up one  weekend when she   d gone to her daughter   s that lives in Lawton. The  guy come out and helped get them closed up over that weekend.  When she came back then Sunday night, she was so upset because she  couldn   t look out on the porch. The porch was not there no more, it was  a bathroom. So, I hung her curtain back up there. I hung the curtain back  in front of the gun cabinet as long as she was here. She never raised the  curtain, never checked it out. She was perfectly happy because her  windows were back there. But she was eighty years old, too. I can see  how important that was, and I   m really kind of proud that I put up with  that and did what Grandma wanted because I   m eighty years old.  (Laughter) It   s kind of hard to make changes. But this is the only home  she knew so I went along with her. Whatever made Grandma  comfortable, we did.  How was the early house heated before you modernized it?  Wood burning stove.  It had wood stoves and the chimney goes all the way upstairs. It also had  wood stoves upstairs. We never put one up there. Oracle gas line goes  through here and Grandma and Grandpa got tied onto the Oracle Gas  several years before I got in the family.  Back in the late-   20s, early-   30s.   Nineteen  thirties, yes. So, they   d been on   the house is on natural gas.  We do still use the wood stove some. I don   t much anymore because I  have to do all the maintenance, and he has to bring me the wood. He has  a fireplace, but I haven   t even had him bring any wood. I   ve burned up  everything from last winter. But it hasn   t been a bad winter, either. So,  but anyway, the lighting   the reason the plugs are in the floor   when  we had electric put in it, they couldn   t get plugs just anywhere because  of the stones. So, they had most of the plugs come up out of the floor.  They had to go under the house. And also with the heating and water for  9  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  upstairs, there was no water. We made a bathroom upstairs, too, but  everything had to be brought under the house and up through the one  closet. People didn   t used to have closets. And they sure didn   t have a  room for each kid. (Laughs)  Everything had to be under the main part of the house. Now, the heating  system, the heater is down here and the air conditioner is out there. That  was their wine cellar. They made wine. That has a double door that used  to have a double screen door out there where they brought in and out  their barrels of wine. There used to be old wooden barrels around, but  they since have rotted and what have you. This was eighty years ago,  ninety years ago, so it   s a long time ago. (Laughs) Anyway, used to, I   d  find little pieces in   a lot of my junk out here, a lot of people think it   s  junk, but I like antiques. Every time I   d find a little bottle that used to  be   that table is full of junk. (Laughs)  They were probably very popular during prohibition. (Laughter)  Well, I was surprised that he would make wine, having the position he  had because Oklahoma was dry for so long. It was really kind of against  the law to run some.  Kind of? (Laughter)  I mean, maybe the grass was tall enough, he felt safe. I don   t know   (Laughs) But anyway, the basement, what they called the basement, it  was not finished. Joe did run some cement on the floor and did some  work. After all these years, I still would like to have a little more work  done down there. But it   s the same size as the kitchen. When they built  the kitchen, they dug that out and then made the kitchen. What kind of  rock is it, limestone?  Sandstone.  That   s the reason this house has very few cracks. It has sat here all these  years.  But that makes a lot of water leaks, though, when it rains especially.  The cellar, the basement, and I don   t use it for a cellar. I had him build  me a cellar because the kitchen floor is the top of this basement. Now, I  had a hot tub down there and used it for that purpose, but then since  then, I   ve given him the hot tub. I can   t go up and down steps anymore. I  had a heart attack and I   m not supposed to go up and down stairs.  Anyhow, that was their wine cellar down below here, this area. But the  lighting in here   and I still have some of the lights hanging in the  10  Nykolaiszyn  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  garage out there   was gas. They had a gas pipe run across the ceiling,  across the ceiling. A mantle like on a Coleman lantern, that was the kind  of lights they had. We took some of them down thirty years ago.  They had electric. Now, all the rooms don   t even have ceiling lights. The  two big front rooms in there, front bedroom and the other front room,  doesn   t even have ceiling lights. They could get plugs down below, but  they couldn   t figure out how to get electricity without wires showing,  being dangerous. The electrician that we had do it was certified. I mean,  he wired stuff out at Fort Sill, so I knew he would do it right. But he said  he could not. Of course, there again, that   s been a little over thirty years  ago that we tried to get electricity in here for Henry   s folks. They did the  best they could getting it in, but because of the walls are so thick, they  couldn   t put it just everywhere you wanted it. So, we did get ceiling  lights and fans in that one bedroom and that room. Of course, this one  wasn   t a problem, it   s wood. They couldn   t figure out how to get it into  those other two rooms. We   ve got plugs in the floor, but that   s it.  (Laughs)  What year did you get electricity in this house?  When you turned forty and I was four.  Well, no. It was in the   let   s see. I   m from west of town, over by Faxon  and over in there. East of Lawton got electricity   do you remember?  When did electricity come over here? East of Lawton got it before west.  I was over west, and we didn   t get electricity over there until late-   40s. I  think that east of town got it around early    40s. And telephones the same  way, they had telephone and electricity on the east of town before we  had it over west of town. We had a dairy, and we didn   t have electricity.  (Laughter)  One more thing about the house, the upstairs used to be a boarding  house?  No, not a boarding house. The boys slept up there. See, Grandma had  her and her sister and then there was three brothers. There was five  children lived here. Grandma was a teacher. His grandma was a teacher  and taught at this little school just a half-mile down the road here.  The upstairs was just for the boys.  Yes. They also boarded a teacher that taught up at Allendale. That   s just,  what, two miles up the road here. See, the schools used to be every two  or three miles because kids had to walk. Well, I walked to school. If I  had not cut through a guy   s pasture, it would have been two and a half  11  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  miles for me to walk around the road to school. But Dad wouldn   t let us  walk, we had to crawl under the fence in front of the house and head  across the cow   (Laughs)  One time you got muddy going to school, too.  Yes, sometimes when he plowed, the guy had his wheat plowed up, they  were getting wheat up, you went to school and had mud clear to your  knees when you got there because you bogged across the ole muddy  field all the way. But anyway, I think it was in the early    40s they got  electricity here. But it was the later    40s before it was available. But  some of those pipes hanging up in the garage out here, that   s what those  lights are. Kind of has the little globe on the bottom and it had like a  Coleman lantern. What do you call those deals you put on there? It put  out light about like a Coleman lantern. They had one of them in each  room, and that was their light.  Grandma always had a   now, their heat   of course, we   ve got central,  now, but they did not have. We haven   t always had, but they had that old  big heater like you used to see in those western shows, the little grocery  stores, that   s the kind of heat.  The wood burning stove, the belly stove.  It was a big ole heater and then they had one in here. But they also  milked and once they got electricity, Grandpa put a motor on the  separator. Do you remember it being sitting over here? They had an  electric separator. They were so proud of that. They didn   t have to turn it  anymore. (Laughs) It sat there for years. They   d go out and milk and  bring it in and pour it through the strainer, and somebody had to stand  there and turn it. When I first got in the family, I   d help do that some.  Henry   s dad figured out some way to put a little electric motor on it. It  looked like one of these air conditioner motors, put it on there and it was  electric, then. You just plugged it in and it would turn it. You didn   t  have to stand there and turn it. (Laughs)  Could you tell me about early crops? What was being grown in the early  days?  Well, wheat mainly and always feed for the cattle. They don   t raise  millet anymore, but that was one of the feeds. Mainly because chickens  and turkeys, it put on a nice head. Grandpa would go out to the field and  his old knife is still out here. He   d go out in the field and chop off the  stalks and bring up here and throw it in the chicken yard. That was how  they fed them. Then, of course, they used it for cow feed. But wheat has  always been     12  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  Uncle Walter raised cotton across the road.  Yes, this across the road was in cotton. That   s one reason that the farm  has not, in my opinion, is not as good because cotton land, if you don   t  keep it drug down, it blows so bad. And all of that blew in and blew over  here. (Laughs) It makes a difference. There   s been many of time     cotton, it   s a lot of work. I   m not fond of cotton. (Laughs) When I was a  kid, I had to chop cotton and I had to pick cotton. I ain   t fond of cotton.  That   s not easy work.  We got out of school to pick cotton, but a lot of the kids folks    were  hired hands. The men worked for other farmers, and those kids didn   t  have  to pick cotton . They were just out of school. It used to make my  sis and I so mad because we   d have to be out there that whole two weeks  picking cotton when the rest of the kids were just horsing around. So,  I   m not real fond of cotton. It   s a lot of work, in my opinion. I know we  had to miss church a lot. I say a lot, often, at certain times of the year  because my husband would have to go out and drag the harrow across  because if the land is sandy at all, it blows like crazy. With the  Oklahoma wind, you know what kind of wind we have, so it seemed like  every Sunday, the wind blew about the time cotton was trying to come  up. It   ll cut it off. It don   t take much of that blowing to cut off your  cotton and then you lose your crop.  You mentioned milk cows.  Cows?  Yes.  Yes, we always milked cows until the last few years.  Did you have chickens or any other type of     Chickens, yes, peacocks.  Peacock  (Laughs)  We had raised ostrich and emus until I got puny. (Laughter)  Yes, I helped her with that.  When the worker can   t work, everything went kaput. (Laughs)  13  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Until I went to work, is what stopped it, too.  Yes, she liked the emus. The ostrich, we didn   t have any problem with  them, but they could be ornery.  Well, they built this beautiful house. What other structures did they build  on the property?  When they first moved, while they were waiting to build the house and  while they were in a tent somewhere out here, they built a barn, two-story  barn. A storm blew it away several years ago, and that really hurt.  That was the neatest barn. They   d use these kind of rocks and set it up,  oh, two or three rows high of the ground and then built this two-story  barn on it. Grandpa had a pulley up there and a rope and that   s how he   d  pull hay up and down, up into the loft, they called it. They lived up there  after they got the barn built. They got to move out of the tent and into  the upstairs of the barn. They finished the barn down below. Well, they  had the structure up of course, but then they made granaries and stuff  down below.  Then they built a chicken house right out here. They moved out of the  barn loft because it was hard for the kids to climb up and down in the  barn and moved into the chicken house. They were about through with  the house by then. So, they moved into the chicken house and stayed in  that until they could move into the house. It was hot in the summer, so  they used that chicken house, left their kitchen out there and cooked out  there that summer. That door went outside, originally. The chicken  house sat right back here. So, they   d go out there and cook. Grandma  used to tell about running back and forth,    I   d get so tired of those boys,  wouldn   t help do nothing     (Laughter)  Anyway, the momma would cook out in what turned out to be the  chicken house. The bathhouse sat just right east of it. That was their  bathroom. I   ve got an old washtub, a bathtub, one of those big   in fact,  I   ve got two of them. One of them we used. I used to bathe my kids     had rinse tubs up on a stand, two rinse tubs, and I put a kid in each side.  (Laughs) But I had five children in about six and a half years so it was a  hurry-up thing, because you had to hurry up and get done doing that so  you could go help milk or something. So, anyway, that   s how they did.  Built the barn first, then they built the chicken house while the house  was being built, and then they moved into the house.  They added this room on after they got the house all finished. They saw  that that was a big house, maybe, but it didn   t accommodate all their  needs, so they built this on then to make a kitchen and moved it out of  the chicken house. They had chickens. They had them in the barn and  14  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  one of the granaries all that time. But they let the chickens have their  own house, then. The kids used to play out in the chicken house. I don   t  know if you remember playing out there. Ray   s kids did. They   re city  cousins and they loved to go out in the chicken house and the bathhouse,  but they had a bathroom and such at home, so it was a novelty for them.  (Laughs) But it   s quite interesting what went on.  Anyway, the house got finished in  19 03 and went on the tax roll and  been on there ever since, I guess still is. In there, I think that   s the book.  I didn   t even look through it to see if that   s the book that tells that   but  his grandpa went, calls it wolf hunting, with President Roosevelt  down   well, it   s Cookietown, now. It   s between here and Wichita Falls,  little town down there, but it tells how he went wolf hunting. I imagine it  was coyotes. It might have been wolves, I don   t know. But they called it  wolf hunting with the president. Also, about marriages that he performed  in what they called the parlor. That room on furthest, there. Those elm  trees, there was four of them. I   ve seen a picture of a carriage, a real  pretty carriage that you see, like on Bonanza or something, sitting out in  front there. He performed weddings in the parlor, they called it. So, he  was one of the early businessmen or whatever. This house, I   m sure  you   re familiar with or have seen the Mattie Beal house in Lawton?  We   ve heard about it.  This house is older than it. It   s not known as well because Mattie Beal  was a real floozy gal. (Laughter) Her house, I   ve been to it many times,  weddings and different  things . It is just open to the public certain  hours. It has been for years. But it was more of a party house. It was not  a working house. (Laughs) It   s got a ballroom upstairs, a big area. Of  course, this could have a ballroom. There   s a lot of room up there, but  this definitely was a family structure. Anyway, this house is older than  the Mattie Beal house there in Lawton that gets quite a bit of  advertisement.  Was your husband solely a farmer or did he have a job outside of the  farm?  Now, my husband was a carpenter, too. He (Joe) farms and had a  backhoe service. You can   t make a living farming. My husband loved  farming. If he (Joe) had time, I think he would like it more. But when  you work at backhoeing all day and at nine, ten o   clock, somebody calls  and tells you they have a cow that   s trying to calve, you   ve got to get out  of bed and come out and help. (Laughs) That kind of disrupts your day.  But anyway, thank goodness I can call on him for that. Like I said, now,  his grandpa was some kind of   I call him politician. Now, just exactly  what, I can   t remember for sure, but he did farm. He was a farmer. He  15  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  built ponds. He had   what did they call it, a Fresno slip?  Yes, a slip.  Something like that. This pond right west of the house, here, now, Joe  has dug it out. It went dry, of course, several years ago. About three or  four years ago, the dam broke and it went dry. He   s cleaned it out and  made it a good pond, but Grandpa had built it with a slip. They call it a  Fresno or slip or something. His granddad did help farmers build ponds  around. Back then, from what I understood, farmers helped each other a  whole lot. They had thrashing machines, they didn   t have combines.  They   d all congregate and thrash for this guy and when they got his,  then they all moved. And it was up to the women, they would cook the  meal wherever the guys were. The farmers, well everybody, used to help  each other with whatever. It   d be good if they could do that now. I think  the world would be in a better shape. (Laughs) But at any rate, that   s  kind of the way it goes.  How did you meet your husband?  Church. Well, not actually at church. I had known him for a long time.  Both families went to the same church and both families lived on a farm.  My dad was acquainted with the Renschen family years before. The  families kind of knew each other. I went to St. Mary   s Catholic School  and so did Henry, my husband. But I never really knew him in school.  He wasn   t but three years older than me, but he was more intelligent. He  graduated from high school when he was sixteen. I didn   t. I got  Rheumatic fever and had to miss a year, my ninth grade. So, I didn   t  graduate until I was almost eighteen. High school years was a mess for  me because I was sick a lot.  Anyway, we had a dairy when I was growing up and he used to come  out with my step-mother   s brother to the farm, I guess. I didn   t know  that he had as often as he said he had. He knew me a long time before I  knew him, is kind of the way it turned out. (Laughs) After I got in high  school, got to feeling better to where I felt like getting around. After  church sometimes, a bunch would get together and go to the movie or  something on Sunday. Or go skating, that was about all there was to do.  That was kind of the way I really met him, I guess. But my dad knew the  family, I guess, forever.  When you got married, did you move to the farm right away?  Yes, sorry to say. (Laughs)  Oh, wow. You don   t sound too thrilled?  16  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Yes, from modern home to one that the studs were showing. (Laughs)  But I   d do the same stupid thing over, I guess, probably. So, I can   t  complain.  At that time when you moved to the farm, was he the owner of the farm  yet?  No, we rented a farm just three miles over here. We lived there for  several years. Well, Lois was a baby, so I guess we   ve had Sue, Linda,  Joe   we lost our first baby. Then Sue, Linda, Joe, Flo. I   d had my fifth  baby in a house that didn   t have   you had to go down the road and haul  water back up in cream cans. It was fun. (Laughter) Didn   t have paper  diapers, either. But anyway, we survived. Then we bought a farm three  or four miles west of where we lived. It was a school lease. We lived  there until we moved up here.  Did you tell them I   m allergic to diapers?  Yes, you was allergic to diapers. (Laughter) They came out with paper  diapers about the time she was born, but she   s allergic. Couldn   t even  use them, so I tried to use them on Sunday or when we went out. That  didn   t even work. But anyway, we lived on the school lease and we  raised wheat. We raised cotton a time or two down there, didn   t we?  Unfortunately.  I hated it. I try to put cotton out of my mind. (Laughter)  Most of the time, just wheat.  Mostly wheat and feed. Of course, your dad raised some kind of hay.  We   ve always had cattle so we had to raise feed for hay. He   s got balers,  now. We had balers. We did baling for ourselves and did custom baling  back when the kids were little. Of course, when Henry got to where he  couldn   t farm anymore or anything, we kind of got out of all that and  just turned everything back to grass. He   s broke out a couple fields  that   try to plant hay because we still have cattle. So, we broke out  some area, try to get some area for the cattle, some feed.  When Henry   s grandparents died, is that when this piece of land came  into his hands? Did he have siblings?  Dad took over before Grandma died. They   d made arrangements.  Your grandpa died and after he passed away, then your dad took over  17  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  farming. Grandma still lived here. One of our daughters moved up here  with her. We still lived on the school lease. One of our daughters moved  up here with her for, I don   t know, two or three years. However long  until Grandma   her daughter, then, put her in a rest home. After she got  in a rest home   well, actually, we moved up here when Grandma was  still alive because that   s when we closed up windows and she didn   t  really like that. So we left it as near like she could   but then I like  antiques enough that I wanted to leave it as near like we could.  The windows were getting bad. They were wooden windows, so I   ve  had all the windows, storm windows or double paned windows, I had all  the windows replaced. It   s had two new roofs over the last thirty years.  He   s redone the porch. It used to be a wood porch floor, but we couldn   t  keep them from rotting, so he   s run cement. The porch is now cement.  It   s basically, we   ve tried to keep it as near like it originally was as we  can. It was his dad, Henry   s wish, that it stay in the family because his  granddad had built the house and he was born and raised here. His folks  owned the house and what have you. So, this place has been left to him.  Not to say that everybody agrees with that decision, but     Well, Joe, growing up, did you have chores around this property? What  would you have to do? (Laughter)  Actually, not much here. We farmed the fifty-six acres north, but  Grandpa still had all the cattle. He had quit farming. But then, of course,  at home, Dad leased land around different places, and so we had several  farms that we put wheat on. I was pretty much the farmer. The girls done  most of the yard work. I   d gather eggs and stuff when I was little, but I  think I probably started plowing when I was probably six, if I remember  right. By the time I was twelve I was doing all of it, just about.  Well, he was the only boy and he had sisters older than him and sisters  younger than him.  He   s in the middle, basically.  He was kind of in the middle of all of them.  We all had our chores to do and the girls had different things they had to  tend to. So, we all worked.  It was hard for me to basically do anything because my seizures got in  the way of everything.  Everybody had chores. It just goes that way on a farm.  18  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  T. Renschen  J. Renschen  T. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  Do you remember the first tractor you got to drive?  It was the 720 John Deere. (Laughter) I couldn   t pull the clutch in the  back. Daddy would get it going. If I had any trouble, I knew how to kill  it, but I couldn   t pull the clutch back. Dad would get it going and then  he   d jump off and I   d stay out there until     You scared me to death. I   d look out there and you   d be plowing, and  you   d barely see his little hand when he   d wave as he went around the     hardly see his head. Fenders were big and he   s sitting down there. I used  to stand there in the back yard and just hope and pray that I could see  him when he comes around and it wasn   t just the tractor. (Laughs) But  he managed.  There was times Dad let me do the driving and he   d throw cubes out,  though.  Well, he   d never let you drive the tractor.  No, I was talking about the pickup part, that   s what I was talking about.  Well, Joe didn   t mind driving the pickup. (Laughs)  I didn   t mind driving the tractor, either. Five sisters? Tractor beats that  any time. (Laughter)  He   d rather be out there anyway.  Where would you go to school?  Geronimo. Yes, we all went to Geronimo.  Was that a one room school, or   ?  Oh, no. Geronimo was   well, there was, I think, nine. There actually  might have been eleven that was supposed to have graduated my senior  year, but I think nine of us actually did. It wasn   t real big.  See, elementary went from kindergarten to sixth grade, then graduate,  then seventh to twelfth grade is how high school went.  We didn   t have to walk. We rode the bus.  Yes, I did, too.  The school bus came up here?  19  J. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Yes.  Yes, I did, too. Mine was like that.  He graduated from Cameron, though. Ag, and he was employed at  Cameron for, I don   t know, three or four years?  Five or six.  But they griped every time he went out in the field to do anything  because he was supposed to be the head of the department, and he   s  supposed to stay in there behind the desk. He just couldn   t do that. So,  he went into business on his own and he   s been playing in the dirt and  tearing up stuff ever since. (Laughs)  Pretty much.  What were holidays like? Would holiday celebrations take place here or  someplace else?  Oh, yes. Back when we was kids, it   d be at our house or maybe at  Grandma   s, up here. Vickie   s on occasion. Yes, there   d be some big  ones. Still are.  We used to offer farm vacation for kids back when we lived down on the  school lease. We always had a yard full of kids on weekends and  summertime. They had plenty to do, but they had time for a little  orneriness, too. (Laughs)  You would never get into any mischief, I   m sure. (Laughter)  Well, we had a game bird farm. We had lots of game birds, different  kinds. I forget, a hundred or something, different kinds of birds and  animals and what have you. I hatched eggs. The kids would gather the  eggs, and I had this huge machine that hatched eggs. We furnished Fort  Sill with quail and stuff to release. We had several hundred thousands of  quail. We   d hatch them and sell them to Fort Sill. Fort Sill bought them  to release on the reservation. So, when I   d clean the incubator out, I   d  have buckets of old rotten eggs or eggs that didn   t hatch. These guys  would get on their motorcycles or little scooters or whatever they had.  (Laughs) They would have a lot of fun. I   ve taken the hose and made  them wash out in the yard more than once. (Laughter) He   s always been  a good worker. He still is, but there   s been a few times that they   ve had a  little recreation. (Laughs)  20  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  How has what   s gone on here on the farm changed through the years?  Did it change much once you moved here?  Oh, I don   t know. Not as dependent on the farm, yes. I mean, yes. It   s  more of a hobby. You don   t come out here to make a living.  You   re not making a living anymore on the farm?  Oh, you can   t make a living farming.  But it   s still here. It   s still got critters to tend to.  Yes, different ones ask me how come I   ve stayed out here. Town ain   t  got nothing for me. (Laughs) I may have a drive-by shooter come by and  shoot me out here, but at least I   ve got a little elbow room in between  times. Lawton   s got to where they just   I hate reading the paper. Every  day there   s somebody that got a little aggravated at somebody and just  decided to blast them. These school and business shootings are getting  terrible.  So, what   s going on on the farm today? Are you running cattle?  Yes, we   ve still got some wheat, but mostly cattle. When Dad gave up  farming and I was busy, wasn   t helping hardly any, he put everything to  grass. So, he could still tend to his cattle and not have to ride a tractor  and be so pressed. We   ve still got a little bit of wheat, but mostly just  grass.  Do you have the original 160, or   ?  Well, Mom   s got this place, this 160 here, 160 across the road, 110 or  whatever on 45th and Baseline, and then the fifty-five acres down at the  creek.  So, you   ve got a lot to keep up with.  Nah, not that much. (Laughter)  Well, that down at the creek, we used to have   in fact, I went down  there this morning to see what shape my camp barn was in. We used to  offer camp for special needs for several years. We built a   it   s better  than camping out in the yard, but it   s not the Hilton. Anyway, we   d have  all the campers. I   d have trouble getting anybody to help with it. So, it  was mainly me and a couple volunteers that would   but you could get  all the campers you could possibly handle. Not just from Lawton. Of  course, Comanche County has over twenty-five hundred special needs  21  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  T. Renschen  J. Renschen  people. That   s just Comanche County. Then when you go into  Duncan   we had them come from Okarche, even. Actually, Oklahoma  doesn   t offer a lot for our special needs. They don   t offer a lot for young  folks, recreation kind of things. They   re getting better, but skating, back  when I was a kid, about the only thing was a movie or skating. Actually,  there   s not a whole lot more than that for young folks now that has any  kind of supervision. It   s out there, but then do you want your kid to hang  out there? (Laughs) So, that part of our times, I don   t feel like has  changed as much as it maybe should or could.  Have you done any conservation efforts on the farm? Terracing,  conservation-type things?  Yes, we were responsible for keeping up   I don   t remember actually  doing the terrace. Building them probably before I was six or seven, but  we would have to maintain them and take the mull-board and plow them  up and be sure to not knock them down and keep maintenance on them.  That was always a big deal.  When Grandpa had this and was still alive, he put those terraces. I think  they are pretty well worked down back here.  How do you want to do that, Mom?  Well, he had the mull-board that you pull it up, direct the water to keep  it from washing your land away and washing gullies and what have you.  Do you have any ponds on this property?  Oh, yes.  Yes, one there, one back there, and then     There   s three. Mom was talking about earlier, I guess, my great-grandpa     maybe my Grandma Renschen remembered when she was a  little girl sitting out and watching my great-grandpa dig that pond. It  took him all summer, and I could not believe how deep and how much  dirt that he had dug because this last summer, the drought   I was out  there with my track hoe and two dump trucks. And after about the first  week, I was in here griping about how much mud there was in that pond.  I was getting sick of that. Mom reminded me,    How would you like to  do that with a team of horses and a little ole skid?    Yeah. All I done was  dig out what my great-grandpa had dug with that team. I didn   t go any  deeper or any bigger. As soon as I hit what had silted in, you could tell  the difference. I could not believe how much he had dug out.  22  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  You can see, all those piles of dirt out there came out of that pond.  So, anyway, she didn   t feel sorry for me on a big track hoe and two  dump trucks. There wasn   t no sympathy there. (Laughs)  Hey, I used to run a bulldozer. (Laughs) You don   t get much sympathy  for doing that.  They dug that with that and Dad had a bulldozer to dig this back, the  other two. That original pond right here by the house was dug with a  team.  This one here was done with one of those little slips. That little ole  bucket wasn   t maybe four foot. No, it wasn   t this wide. And a team of  horses. In and out, in and out. (Laughs)  You mentioned the drought this past year. Did that really affect what you  all were doing out here?  It saved me from having to plow a bunch. That   s all it did. (Laughter)  It   s a hobby for this farming, now, for me. I mean, it was a terrible, hot,  dry, yes. But no, instead of plowing, I was digging out ponds. There  certainly was no hay. For example, I leased seventy acres of alfalfa. The  year before last, I got six cuttings of hay. One cutting, I got 169 round  bales, just one cutting. This past year, I got two cuttings of hay. The first  one, I got twenty-eight bales of hay and the next one, I got eighteen. So,  yes, that didn   t make very good payments on my hay equipment.  Ask him how it looks for this year   s cutting. (Laughter) We   re praying  for rain tomorrow night. They   re saying a good rain Saturday night.  Yes. Hopefully, it won   t do this again.  They   ve called all week for rain. We   d had no rain.  But Mother Nature usually changes it by the time they say something,  though.  It is so dry. It   s just pitiful. I don   t know.  But there were droughts back in the Dust Bowl days, too. So, this is not  the only year that     Oh, I   m sure that your family has seen changes;    30s and drought and  Depression     23  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Grasshoppers. I remember grasshoppers so bad on the fence posts, you  couldn   t see the post for the grasshoppers. They followed the shade  around that post all summer. In the morning, they was on the west side  and in the evening   but that post would be yellow with those old  yellow-bellied grasshoppers. Do you remember that?  No.  Did you have a problem with jackrabbits back then?  Some.  We sure don   t anymore.  Now, I remember when I was a kid, I remember Dad and the neighbors  having what they called rabbit drives. The rabbits were real bad, but this  is early-   40s, late-   30s, early-   40s. I do remember Dad complaining  about rabbits just eating up everything.  Oh, I didn   t know that.  Would they work on any WPA  Works Progress Administration   projects?  They didn   t have any.  They built some bridges. Some of these bridges     You talking about the family?  Yes, the family.  During the Depression, or   ?  Did they work for the WPA?  They still had milk cows and tended to the farm. Uncle John and some  of them older boys     Some of those older boys might have because they were laborers most of  the time. They never did own     That   d be my grandma   s brothers, maybe.  Grandma   s two older brothers. Herman was a brother that lived right  across over here. He farmed all the time. But then, John, he just was a  24  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  laborer of some kind. I   m not real sure. John wasn   t a real heavy worker.  I   m not real sure. (Laughs) He was a real nice guy.  No, WPA wasn   t     But he always just as soon be free, footloose, and    (Laughs)  Do you have a family cemetery where everybody goes?  No.  No? Where are your husband   s grandparents?  They   re all buried up here at Highland.  Even Ehlman? Grandma and Grandpa Ehlman?  Yes. Yes.  I haven   t been to their cemetery, gravesite.  Way off there on the side, that old part. If you drive through it, you can  tell the old part of the cemetery. They   re all buried out there. There is a  cemetery just two miles west, up the road here, that the DeVines and  some of the     Some of the neighbors are buried in there.  Yes, it   s kind of a family cemetery. Allendale Cemetery, they call it.  There   s a couple of the families from around here that a lot of their  relatives are buried there. All of ours, as far as I know   and I think his  folks is the only Renschens. I don   t know any other Renschens any  closer than Illinois. There are still several relatives in Illinois that we  have been up to visit. I don   t know of any around here, any closer than  there.  How have your neighbors changed through the years?  A lot more of them. (Laughter) About like me, they   ve got a job in town.  Some of the   George Philips, there   s some full-time farmers around.  But most of them have a supplement of some type, to pay. Yes. Even  George is a retired fireman so he   s not depending on the crop, entirely.  Not like it used to be.  Kennedy is one of them that   s a farmer down here, too.  25  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  Looking at the next one hundred years, what do you hope happens to  this particular piece of property? What do you hope happens here,  looking into the future?  Just like it is now. Maybe a little more improvement. Be sure it at least  maintains what we   ve got now. There won   t be any neighbors on this  place as long as I   m in control. There may be some across the road or  somewhere, but there won   t be no houses built on this place.  That was one of his dad   s and his grandma   s wishes, that it stay in the  family. He has three sons. One is married, two young boys. One is not  even out of high school yet, his youngest son. The other one graduated  last year. Heith lives up the road, here. He   s married and has three little  children, two little twin girls and a little boy. So, there are other  Renschens around that if he wants to leave it to some of them, why,  that   s up to him. His dad sure wanted it to stay in the family. He had  gotten it from his folks and they had got it from Great-grandma and  Grandpa. All that   s ever lived here is them.  Wanted to have a Renschen history, is what they   re doing.  His grandpa built the house and there ain   t never been nobody but  Renschens live in it. He would like to   and I   m doing my darndest to  see that he gets it. (Laughs) It   s going to be up to him, then, to see if he  can hang on to it. And I think he can. I mean, I know he will, but you  just never know. Time will only tell what goes on.  We   ve been in some other parts of Lawton where you can see the  developments starting to creep up on farmland. We haven   t drove  around too much around here, but I don   t know how far they are from  here.  We don   t have any big, major developments around, but houses keep  coming up everywhere.  For the most part, farmers are pretty good to kind of keep an eye out for  things. I   ve got neighbors that live right across over there that if they  don   t see me in the yard, they   ll pull in. If nothing else, just pull in and  make sure I   m still in here, you know.  They even call you, too.  Yes, sometimes they call and,    Hadn   t seen you in the yard for a day or  two, you been sick?    Here a while back, I had pneumonia, was in the  hospital for almost two weeks. It was thirteen days. This one neighbor  came the next day, he said,    Boy, I   m sure glad to see you  I   ve been  26  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  J. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  T. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  T. Renschen  D. Renschen  over there and you weren   t home and I tried to call       I guess he   d  stopped up here at Heith   s and wasn   t nobody home there. He said he  couldn   t figure out what was wrong with us or where we was at.  (Laughs) Some of my neighbors, they   re real good citizens, stop in. I  appreciate that, too.  You seem to be doing pretty well for your age, considering. (Laughter)  Well, if you didn   t notice, I had a wet head when you got here because I  just got out of the shower because I   d been out feeding the cow that had  a bad delivery.  Yes, we had to pull a calf.  Then went and checked on another field that is supposed to get sprayed  for weeds. And, boy, it sure does need it.  Yes, I know.  I just got back in time to   I said,    Oh, my gosh. Look at that, it   s after  twelve o   clock.    I just got time to run in the bathroom and take a  shower.  She had seen her tomato situation at her creek house.  I told Tonya, I said,    If they come, just have them come on in.    She said,     Well, what do I do?    I said,    Just tell them to sit down, I   ll be right  out.    (Laughter)  I didn   t know. That   s why I asked.  Well, it   s good that you stay so busy, I think. (Laughter)  I stay with her all the time to keep an eye on her like she keeps an eye on  me.  There   s not much money made in farming, but if you don   t require a lot,  it   s a pretty good life. When we married, he had rented a farm and it had  this little ole house on it, and he had a crippled Jersey heifer cow. That  was what we had when we got married. And a well down the road where  you could go get good water. It was good water  I wish all water out of  the faucet was as good of water as that was. (Laughter) It was real soft  well water, spring water. Hey, and it taste real good. You had to go  down there with your cream cans and draw it out of a well, but it was  water. Let   s hope we don   t ever have to always do that again, but better  yet, let   s hope that our well water doesn   t get contaminated someway to  27  Nykolaiszyn  D. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  T. Renschen  Nykolaiszyn  where we don   t even have well water. Our lakes, I   m concerned about  our lakes and things. When they can blow up a building just by flying a  plane, they can contaminate a whole lake just by flying a plane.  Well we covered probably just a little snapshot of life here on the farm.  Is there anything else you   d like to add before we close out, today?  Anything else you want to tell us?  Life is good. This is the year I was born (gestures) and that   s prices of  your commodities back eighty years ago. (Laughter)  Time has changed.  Oh, yes.  Well, we really appreciate you sitting down with us, and we thank you  for your time, today.  -------  -------
