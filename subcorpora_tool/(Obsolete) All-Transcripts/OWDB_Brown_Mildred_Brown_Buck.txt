We   re in Gage, Oklahoma at the Gage Community  Center. We will be talking with Mildred and Buck Brown.  Were you both born in Oklahoma?  I was; he wasn   t.  Where were you born?  Nine miles north of town.  I was born in Lamont, Missouri.  We   ve got a lot of Missourians here.  Where   s that?  It   s just a few miles from Sedalia. It   s a small, small town.  I   m from Missouri.  Oh yeah, what part of Missouri are you from?  I was born in Fort Leonard Wood. I grew up on a farm in Fairgrove, just north  of Springfield.  Our son took training at Fort Leonard Wood. He about smothered to death in  the summer.  It   s humid and hot.  Yes, we found that out.  What year were you born?  November 1, 1917.  That   s the third 1917 person we   ve had today. It   s a popular year I guess.  5  B. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  And what about you? I know this is supposed to be more about her, but since  you   re here I want to get your stuff too.  I was born in Lamont, Missouri, May 6, 1914.  What brought you to Oklahoma?  My mother got to where she had asthma real bad, and they recommended that  they come where it was hotter and drier and so on, so we moved here.  His dad was a mail carrier, so he traded routes.  Oh, easy enough. And then you moved right here?  Yeah.  And you   ve been here ever since.  Well, we   ve traveled around quite a little in our life. We left here in 1935 and  moved to Miles City, Montana. We lived there seven years, then we moved to  San Diego, California. I lived there four years; he was two years in the  service.  Was in the army most of the time   You left in 1935, was that because of the weather?  No, we had gotten married and he got offered a job. His brother-in-law had a  big service station up there. It was a twenty-four hour deal. And he offered  him a job, so we moved up there.  You got married in 1935?  1934.  You were pretty young at that time, eighteen.  Seventeen.  She was seventeen and I was twenty.  I said I   d kill a kid if mine would do that   Laughter   That   s what I was getting ready to ask you, how you   d feel. But look how it   s  paid off.  We   ve almost been married sixty-seven years now. We will be November first  of this year.  6  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  It   s weird how it seems all right for you to have done that, but you wouldn   t  want anybody     Oh no.  Laughter   So when did you start dating, or when did you know you were going to be  together?  Well, I was raised on this farm out north of town, he lived out east of town  here. My cousin and I were listing eighty acres of land for another cousin of  mine. They were having an MYF church party down here, and I wanted to go.  This cousin that I was working for said that was all right, so my mother  brought me down here to this party. Buck asked her if he could take me home.  She consented to let him, and we just started going together. We went together  for a little over a year.  You were doing the listing?  Yes.  Did you do a lot of the farm work?  Oh yeah, I worked out in the field all the time. I had four head of horses on  the lister.  So that means two and two or you had four going like that?  No, two and two like that. My cousin that was working with me, he was using  four span of mules on his lister.  Were they double listers or single?  Doubles.  It   s odd, or maybe it   s odd I don   t know, to see women doing that kind of heavy  farm work.  Back in those days, they worked as hard as men.  I   d worked every piece of machinery he had but the self-propelled combine.  That scared me. I   d run the old type, but you had to run with a wheel. When it  came to the self-propelled, I backed off of that.  Was farm work a part of your daily routine?  Oh yes, milking cows.  How many brothers and sisters did you have?  7  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Well, I was raised in a split family I guess you   d say. My dad had been  married and had three children, and his wife died. My mother had been  married, and she had two children, and her husband died. His first wife and  my mother were sisters. My dad married sisters.  Oh, all right, that makes it easier.  After they married, they had my sister and I. I had five half brothers and  sisters and one whole one.  So seven all together.  My dad   s oldest son   s wife died when his second child was born. They lived  in New Mexico. When she was three weeks old, my dad went and got the two  girls and brought them back to Oklahoma. My folks raised the one that was  three weeks old, so she was like a sister. I was actually her aunt.  So you were one of the younger kids.  I was the last one.  What age did you get out in the field and start working with the farm  machinery?  Oh, I can   t remember. I can   t remember when I didn   t know how to milk a  cow   Laughter  We just worked out in the field when we got ten or eleven  years old.  So you attended school, and then you were expected to help out doing the farm  chores and things. Did the harvest store, the planting, or different times  interfere with your schooling?  No, my mother saw we were in school. She was great for education. She  always saw that we were in school when we were supposed to be.  So you would have been eighteen, well between fifteen and eighteen, right  around the time when it started getting really, really dirty.  I was sixteen when I graduated from high school. The depression was along in  that time. We just didn   t have many clothes or anything. We always had  enough to eat. My mother raised chickens, and we always had cows and we  always had milk. My mother was a big gardener, and we always canned lots  of fruit. When I was growing up, we had a big orchard, and we had all kinds  of fruit. She canned 500-600 quarts every summer.  Wow, that would fill up the cellar, wouldn   t it?  If we were to have company, we would just go down in the cellar and grab jars  of stuff. She   d have a meal in probably forty-five minutes.  8  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  Lemons  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Lemons  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  What would a typical meal be like for you?  Our breakfasts were either cornbread or hot biscuits and gravy and meat and  eggs and usually potatoes. That was a typical breakfast. My dad got up at  4:30 every morning and went out and took care of his horses. My mother got  up, and she would have breakfast ready when he got back in about six o   clock.  We always had meat three times a day. My dad killed beef and he raised his  own hogs. He butchered his own hogs. He had a smoke house, and he  smoked his own meat. He cured his own meat. Mama always raised two or  three hundred chickens.  Wow, you had a big operation going. So you always had chicken and eggs  and meat and everything. Do you remember what you would have if company  was coming? Like if the preacher was coming over?  Laughter   Well, every Saturday we made a cake or two. She was a big pie maker. She  made three or four pies. We were related to practically everybody in that  neighborhood. We had a little country Sunday school a quarter of a mile from  where we lived. We went every Sunday. We didn   t ask if we were going; we  knew we were going. He   d invite maybe twenty-five or thirty home. I   ve seen  my mother get up and kill four or five chickens before we go to Sunday  school, because we didn   t have refrigeration. Then it would be fried chicken,  mashed potatoes and gravy, and vegetables, and the pies and the cakes.  I just ate, but you   re making me hungry.  What was your favorite food?  I don   t know.  Just food.  Laughter   We liked fried chicken a lot. I basically cook that way now. I   d hardly use  any boxed up.  Where do you live?  Right down the street.  We might stop by there   We   re going to come by about six o   clock.  Laughter   Okay.  How old were you when you moved to Gage?  I think I was in about the fourth grade.  9  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  M. Brown  B. Brown  So about eight or nine.  You came here in    26, didn   t you? Figure that up.  I   d have been fourteen; I mean more than fourteen.  Yeah, you   d have been twelve.  I   d have been twelve, yeah.  It sounds like you had a pretty prosperous farm. Do you think you were in the  upper levels of the community of farmers around here?  My dad, he came here from Kansas because his first wife had asthma, and they  had recommended that he come to western Oklahoma thinking the climate  might help.  Gage must be the asthma capitol of the world.  And it helped for a year or so, but then she got to having it again. What I  started to say was, he bought this one farm that we have out here. I inherited  that when he died. He accumulated enough that he had a quarter of land for  each one of his kids when he died. That wasn   t counting my mother   s  children. That was his and theirs. It would be five quarters.  Wow, not bad. How about you? Your dad was a postman, is that what you  said?  Yeah, a mail carrier.  So you lived in town, or did you   ?  No, we lived on a farm too.  So he farmed and carried mail.  Yeah.  What was your typical day like? Was it farm chores?  Yeah. We farmed. We had maize, but we never planted wheat or anything.  We had maize and stuff like that. For our money crop, we grew broomcorn.  Don   t ever get into that   Laughter  We raised it one year, he and I did. I  couldn   t pull broomcorn and scratch fast enough. That   s the itchiest stuff.  We just tried that one year. We raised broomcorn because you could sell that a  lot easier. We raised maize and stuff like that to feed the cows and the horses.  10  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  We didn   t have tractors or anything.  Always working with horses. You worked with horses until when?  I don   t know how old I was. We worked with horses until I was married.  When we moved back here, we worked with tractors, he and I.  It seems like my mom can remember the names of all of her horses she worked  with. Do you remember your names?  No.  Oh, come on. You   re the first person I   ve run into that   s worked with horses  that doesn   t remember their names.  I don   t remember.  I can   t remember.  I probably gave them some names that they didn   t have sometimes.  Laughter   Do you remember a distinct time when you recall looking around thinking  things weren   t as good as they used to be, or when money got a little tight?  When I went to high school there were two girls, one girl lived six miles north  of where I lived. I walked a quarter of a mile and met her at the corner. She  picked me up, and then we went another mile and picked another girl up.  Then we rode into town. I paid her five dollars a month to ride with her. Then  those two girls graduated. There weren   t school buses at that time. You had  to do your own transportation, so I roomed and boarded with an older lady in a  house right across from the quick stop up there. My mother would bring me in  on Sunday night and come get me Friday evenings. She paid that lady five  dollars and a quarter a month for room and board. That   s how cheap things  were at that time. I had a north room. There was no heat in it, so I had to do  everything out where the other family was. They just heated that one room.  When I got ready for bed, I   d go jump in the bed, and the way I landed, that   s  where I stayed  laughter  because it was so cold. I had two or three or four  dresses, and I   d go home and I   d wash on the board my clothes and my  underclothes on the board and iron them, so that I could come back on Sunday  nights. I didn   t have very many clothes.  Do you remember when you first recalled there being a depression or hard  times? What brought that to your mind?  I   ll tell ya, everybody was in the same boat. You didn   t know if you were hard  off or not.  When we were married, actually, we didn   t have anything. We did have a  place to live.  11  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  M. Brown  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  M. Brown  Where did you live when you first were married?  Two and a half miles east of town here and a quarter south.  Did you lease some land?  We just leased it.  Yeah, his dad had it.  My dad had it. Then he moved to town. My mother passed away, and he got  married again. They moved to town and left us kids out there.  When you were living out there and didn   t have any money and were farming  that land, what would you all do for entertainment?  We didn   t even have a car. If somebody didn   t come and get us, we walked.  We would have parties. Two or three couples would get together and play  cards or some kind of game.  What kind of games? What kind of card games?  Oh, rook or pitch or dominoes, those kind of games. We made our own  entertainment.  The church here, we were Methodist, it was pretty. We had some ladies that  were always doing things for kids. They were all friendly. They were sure  wonderful. They would see that we had parties. We had a big time just from  church. Sometimes they would have other churches come, and we   d have a  big ol    party down there. That   s where I met her.  Oh that   s right.  An MYF party, that   s a youth group.  Methodist Youth Fellowship.  These ladies, they just loved the kids.  You   d get together and play games?  Yeah, play games, and you always brought something to eat.  We went to something we called party games. That was similar to square  dancing. You   d come to town on Saturday afternoon, and this was a big  Saturday afternoon town. Somebody would say,    We   re having a party at our  place tonight, come     That   s the way word got around, and gosh, there would  be thirty-five, forty, maybe fifty kids there. We   d play these party games we  12  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  called them. They sang songs kind of like square dancing.  And you would square dance?  Well, not really square dance, but we did similar things. It was a big ring that  we made.  Somebody was doing the calling.  And you would do what they tell you to do. My mother wouldn   t let me  dance. I would have loved to have danced. She was pretty straight laced, and  she didn   t believe in that, but she   d take me to every party game.  So she wouldn   t let you dance, but she   d let you go around in a circle and hold  hands and go in and out.  Another thing, she wouldn   t let us play pitch with pitch cards. We could play  rook, but we couldn   t play pitch. She and my dad and my aunt and uncle  could play forty-two with dominoes. That   s the very same game pitch is but  with dominoes.  With dominoes   I can   t explain that one.  I never could either.  Do you remember as a child what you would do for entertainment? Before  you were too old to not dance.  Laughter   There was a girl that lived about a half a mile from me, and she   d come over.  My mother raised a bunch of chickens. We had a brooder house that we  started them out in. When they got too big for the brooder, she   d put them in  another chicken house for them to grow. I could have the brooder for my  playhouse. This girl and I, we would make that into a little house for us.  We   d rope off different areas of it for different rooms. We played house a lot.  I played dolls. We had a big orchard, and there wasn   t any tree that I couldn   t  get to the top of if I wanted to. Sometimes we   d stake out a house underneath  these trees. We   d take long nails and binder twine and make our rooms, just  imagination.  What about you? As a child, what would you do for entertainment or fun?  I don   t know, but I was pretty busy doing something.  Always staying out of trouble.  Well, not hardly   Laughter  I had three older sisters that kind of looked after  me.  13  M. Brown  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  M. Brown  B. Brown  In other words, he was spoiled   I got to do about anything I wanted to.  I thought he was going to say that they dressed him up   I wasn   t around him, so I don   t know what he did.  I don   t remember.  You didn   t really meet until you were sixteen or seventeen or something like  that?  We had gone to high school together. He had graduated two years before I  did, but he didn   t pay any attention to an undergraduate.  What would you be, eighth or ninth grade?  He was a senior when I was a sophomore.  I bet after you graduated you looked a little better.  I guess.  Laughter  The funny thing of it was, I was kind of like Rudolph the  red nosed reindeer. I had worn goggles out there in the fields, like this, to keep  the dirt out of my eyes. Well my nose was sunburned a bright red when I took  those goggles off. That   s the way I went to that party.  So were you attracted to her bright shiny nose?  Her shiny nose, yeah.  We   ll have to write that down for future use. Do you remember the first dust  storm you saw?  We weren   t in the dust storm. We had moved from here at that time.  You moved in    35, is that right?  March of    35.  So you don   t recall many storms.  Well, there were some.  Not the big dust storms, honey.  No, not the big ones, but we had a few dry seasons that had the ground  blowing pretty good.  14  Kite  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  M. Brown  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  B. Brown  Right, you missed out on the big ones by a month or so.  We just saw it when we came back, and we were real surprised. The whole  ground was just blowing away.  We just didn   t have any money, hardly. I worked for a lady in a harvest crew  one summer. A harvest crew is thirteen men. These people had six in their  family. I helped this lady cook one summer. I got fifty cents a day and my  board and room. We got up at four o   clock in the morning and started our  breakfast. We   d have dinner and supper to cook for that whole bunch. Plus,  you always took them something out to the field mid morning and mid  afternoon.  That sounds like hard work.  It was hard work. I earned enough that summer to buy enough material to  make my school clothes for the next term.  The Wall Street crash was in 1929. All of the people here were not doing well  even before then. Do you remember any incidence of vagrants or tramps  coming through town or coming to your farm looking for handouts or work?  Well we didn   t have any out in there. They may have had here. We didn   t get  to town very much, just maybe once a week.  What about your family? Any hobo visitors?  Yeah. We lived just down the way here, and you   d see them all over  everywhere. They seemed to come in bunches. I don   t know why, but they  did. Everybody fed them what they could. There weren   t a lot of people that  had an awful lot of money or anything. Even my dad carrying the mail and all,  he had quite a time.  He had seven kids.  Seven kids too. Seven of us.  So you remember a lot of hobos, and you don   t recall any coming by. I  wonder if your parents were a little less forgiving.  Well see, we lived nine miles out in the country.  Nine miles out in the country. There would be some.  Some would come by.  Some would come by. They   d usually ask if there was anything they could do  for him. They would like to work for a handout.  15  Kite  B. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Kite  Do you recall them ever working around the house, or were they just fed?  I can remember that mom used to have them wash her windows or paint,  something like that. If she had any money, there wasn   t an awful lot  anywhere. She would see that they were fed.  What about gypsies?  Oh yeah, I remember gypsies.  Tell us about them.  They used to scare me to death.  I was scared to death of them. My folks had gone somewhere that day,  probably to town to get supplies. I had gone home, and they weren   t home. I  looked out the window, and there were a bunch of gypsies in a covered wagon  coming down the road. I tell you, I was absolutely scared spit less. I had  heard a lot of things about gypsies, you know.  Like what kinds of things?  Oh, that they stole kids, and they would take everything you had in your house  if they had a chance. I called the neighbor lady; they lived a quarter of a mile  south of the Miller Schoolhouse. I told her that I was home alone and the folks  were gone and that there was a wagonload of gypsies coming down the road.  She said,    Well you watch them and if they start to turn in, call us and we   ll  come over.    In the mean time, I got under the bed and hid. Then I thought,  they   ve got dogs that can smell you. I hid here and I hid there. I was just fit to  be tied. Every once in a while, I   d go peek out the window. Luckily, they  went by, they didn   t stop, but I was absolutely scared to death.  What did they look like?  What nationality would I say? They   re swarthy skinned people and real dark  hair usually. We had a bunch here in town. We used to run a drug store over  across the street here, where this pet shop is. A bunch of them hit town here  one time, and boy, they were going in the stores. They went in the grocery  store over there, and they couldn   t watch them fast enough. They were  grabbing stuff off of the shelves. They wear real big gowns with a lot of  pockets, so they can stash stuff away. A storekeeper ran to the phone and  called me and told me to lock the doors because they   re going into stores and  you can   t watch them. We had a real nice drug store over there. So I locked  the doors, and they didn   t get into our place. They   re real bad. They   ll steal  you blind.  Do you remember gypsy stories as a child? They were coming by in the  thirties, is that right, or twenties?  16  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  Thirties. Probably about 1930 I   d say.  And at that time, you were running a drug store?  No, he and I had a drug store over here on the corner after we came back from  California.  You moved to Montana, then to California, and then?  And then back here.  Why   d you move back here?  Because, when he got out of the service, he couldn   t get a job. There were  thousands of navy and marines.  Everybody was walking the street.  And you had your quarter section right back here.  Yeah, we owned a quarter at home.  We had it, so we decided to come back here. We had one boy who was about  five or six years old then. He was getting ready to start school. We came back  here and bought some cows and some machinery and started farming and  milking cows. I raised chickens, and we raised pigs.  Then you had the drugstore operation too.  Yeah, the drugstore, and we owned a caf  .  Wow.  Yeah, where this breezeway is over here, we had a little caf   in there first for  three and a half years. I was working sixteen hours a day and I finally got to  where I couldn   t do it. The drugstore was for sale, so we bought that out. We  were in there fifteen years.  What year did you come back to Oklahoma?  Forty-six.  So you kind of farmed and had businesses in town.  And he drove the school bus.  I drove the school bus for a number of years, and then I was janitor for a  number of years.  17  M. Brown  Lemons  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  He   s got a sign shop across the street over here that he   s run for thirty years. I  had a drapery shop in there.  You guys were busy.  Sign shop, drapery shop, drugstore, caf  , janitor, school bus driver, farmer,  gas station operator.  Anything to make an honest living. We were bound that our son was going to  go to college, and you know what college costs.  We got him through.  We got him through college. I still sew for people, do alterations, and make  quilts and sell them to people.  Do you remember any friends or relatives that moved out or lost their farms  because of the depression?  My sister and her husband moved to California when the dust bowl days came.  Then my other sister and her husband moved to Wyoming. They were up  there for a number of years. They came back here in about forty-one. It was  about the first party of World War II.  Do you remember, when you were younger, losing friends?  Of course, we left here in    35, so there could have been a lot in that period.  Did you always have electricity at your house?  We got electricity in about    44 or    45. We didn   t live here. I lived in  California. My sister lived on this place out here that we   ve got. The line was  going by our place. There   s a line that goes by Shaddock that has something  to do with this airport out here. They were running a line to that, and if they  passed your place they would hook you on. We were one of the first that got  hooked on. I think that was about forty-four or along in there.  So the first time you had electricity was in California.  Montana.  Montana. Do you remember what was its    first form? Was it a light bulb, or  what did you do with it? Did you wash clothes or iron? What   s the best thing  you remember about electricity?  Ironing. Did you ever iron with sadirons? I   ll tell you what. When I was still  at home, my dad put in a carbide system. It had little lights up here, kind of  like the metal part of that fan. You turned a spigot like this and flipped  18  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  Lemons  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  another thing and it turned those lights on. We had a spigot that came out  from the wall, and there was an iron that went with it. It had a long cord on it  that you screwed into this spigot thing. Then you lit this iron with a match in  under here. It had a thing back here that you controlled your heat with. We  thought we were pretty uptown when we got that.  You had your carbide iron.  Because we got away from those old sadirons that you had to heat on the  stove. Everything in those days was starched.  Yeah, that was days when you ironed your washcloths and you ironed your tea  towels. You ironed your socks.  Everything.  What about your electricity experience? Did you first have electricity at the  same time as her?  Well, his folks lived in town, and they had it in here.  My folks lived in town, but we didn   t have it on the farm.  We didn   t have it out east of town.  When we were first married we didn   t have it.  We had kerosene lamps.  So you went from having it to not having it.  Well, yeah. When we lived in town, we had it. When we moved out there on  the farm, it was just old coal or oil lamps.  We cooked on kerosene stoves or a coal burning range. Are you familiar with  this country? Are you familiar with the big tornado we had here?  What year?     47.  No, I don   t think I ever heard about that one.  Well, it was one that went south of town and almost blew Woodward away.  When we moved back here from California, we wanted to put in a butane  system, but you couldn   t get stoves or anything because of the war effort.  They just didn   t have them. So I looked around and I found a little heater  stove. We had the butane put in and used it as a little heater. I signed up  several different places for a cook stove. I had signed up at Ticer   s at  19  Lemons  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Woodward, and they carried butane stuff. I   d signed up several different  places. One day, I had been cooking on an old oil stove that my mother had  thrown away, and I about caught the house on fire. It scared the living day  lights out of me, so I told Buck; we   re going to get a butane stove today.  Enough of that.  Yeah. So we went to Woodward, and Ticer   s was just unloading a whole  carload of stoves. I said which one of those is mine, and they kind of got to  hammin    and hollerin    around. I just looked around a little, and I said I   ll take  that and I want it delivered tomorrow. And they let me have it  laughter .  That night, they blew away. It wiped them clean, that tornado.  Did you get your stove first?  Yes. They installed it that day.  They delivered your stove, and then that night no more store.  It blew it away. It wiped them clean; they didn   t have anything left.  One of the topics that we really hadn   t thought of, but after doing a few  interviews keeps coming up, is you guys had bed bugs?  Oh yes, we got those once   Laughter   What do you do when you get bed bugs? Can you see them or do you just find  them because they bite you?  You can see them.  They get pretty large.  They get about as big as my fingernail. When they get full of your blood,  they   re real dark red.  So they   re kind of like ticks?  Well, they don   t stay on you; they just stay in your bed or around. I had a  niece that was working for a lady here in town. Every weekend she would  bring her clothes and come home. In a little while, I began having hives  My  mother took me to the doctor, and they said to eliminate this kind of food,  maybe this will do it, and all that. One night I went to one of these play  parties. I came in, my sister and her husband had taken me, I laid down on the  bed, and hadn   t been there but about ten minutes, and I began to have hives. I  thought it was strange that when you lay down you have hives, and when  you   re up a going you don   t. I got up and lit the lamp and turned back the  covers. We had mattresses that where they were put together they had tuffs of  cotton. I raised that cotton up, and they were alive with bed bugs. So I got a  20  Lemons  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Lemons  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  pillow and a blanket and got down on the floor. The next morning, we took  the mattresses out in the yard. We went around all that with kerosene, and we  went all around the baseboards of the room and around the door jams. We did  it every place where there was a crack, the window casings and everything.  We did that every morning.  For how long?  For about a week or two. They have what they call nits and you have to get rid  of those too. We came to find out that the lady she was working for had bed  bugs. They didn   t bother my niece, but she was bringing them home to us in  her clothes all the time. They just love me. They make big welts on me. One  time, when he was in the service up at Fort Riley, Kansas, my son and I had  come from California to be up there until they shipped him over seas. I was  going from Fort Riley into Wichita, and I had to lay over there for about two  or three hours. That was when they had train service here. They had a ladies  lounge in there with metal chairs that had little criss-cross things. He and I  were just lounging around in there, and pretty soon, I began having welts  underneath my knees. I thought it could be mosquitoes, so I got up and moved  over to the beds that they had at the side of the room. I hadn   t been there very  long before I started getting welts again. By that time, I got a little suspicious.  I turned those chairs upside down, and they were a solid mass of bed bugs. I  looked up somebody that was supposed to be looking after that. I told them  that they were loaded with bed bugs in those chairs. They kind of laughed and  said,    Oh yeah, we get them in here every once in a while. People carry them.     I was scared that I would carry them to my sister, she lived out here on this  farm we have. Before I went in the house, we went through my suitcase with a  fine toothcomb. I hadn   t gotten any in there. But I know about bed bugs.  You know a lot about bed bugs.  They use to have them in the lumberyards too. That   s where houses got them  a lot.  Yeah, I heard people say they went to get boards to build their bed frame, and  there were bed bugs in it even before they made their bed.  Wood bugs.  One time when we lived in Montana, he was on a gas truck to deliver gas to all  these ranches all around; he went out to this one rancher   s to deliver gas. It  was about noon, so they asked him to stay for dinner. He just took his jacket  off, laid it on the bed, and ate dinner. He came home that night and laid it on  our bed. We went to bed that night, and hadn   t been there but about fifteen  minutes and the thing bit me about three times. I said that there   s a bed bug in  here. Boy, we jumped up, and I found one. I combed that bed every morning  for a week or more. He had carried it home on his jacket.  I wonder what happened to all the bed bugs. Did they just disappear?  21  M. Brown  B. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  Lemons  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Kite  Lemons  M. Brown  Lemons  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  I suppose with all the stuff that they spray around that they probably got rid of  them.  You don   t hardly hear about them any more.  Until people started telling us about them, I thought it was just something  made up. I didn   t think it was a real thing.  It isn   t made up   Laughter   They just make welts on you.  What they do is suck the blood out of you. It makes them swell up, and  they   re real dark red. You mash one and it   s a big dab of black.  What about other physical things like cures or elixirs? The medicine shows.  Home remedies.  My mother was full of those. She was kind of a practical nurse. We had this  mixture of sulphur and molasses.  Oh, what was that supposed to cure?  That was supposed to be a blood purifier. In the spring, you drank sassafras  tea, which I loved. You used to be able to buy it at a drug store, but you have  to have a prescription now, because it is a blood thinner. We had to drink that  every spring to thin our blood.  Do you remember the worst cure she ever gave you?  Something that you   d rather be sick than go through that?  I don   t know.  We   ve heard some people tell some stories. Skunk oil on your feet, I don   t  know about that.  I talked to one lady who said her mom would make up a bread and milk  poultice and stick it on whatever was ailing you.  I   ve heard of that. It   s for boils. Mama used to do that.  Bread and milk?  Yeah.  Do you remember any cures that you were subjected to?  22  B. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  B. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  I can   t think of any.  You kind of blocked them out of your memory   It seems like I used to have the stomach flu a lot when I was growing up. This  sounds terrible. They say that chicken soup is good for flu, but maybe she  didn   t have chicken broth or anything because there was no refrigeration.  She   d take really, really hot water, boil it, put it in a cup, and then she   d put  some butter and salt and pepper in there. Then we   d put crackers in it. It  actually did kind of taste like chicken soup.  That   s pretty innovative.  It kind of settled your stomach when you had an upset stomach.  Did you ever have anything for earaches?  Well, she heated hot mineral oil in a spoon, put a drop or two in, and put  cotton in it.  My mom used to tell about how her dad would blow pipe smoke in their ears  when they had earaches.  That   ll work too.  Yeah. My dad did that.  Not really?  Yeah, that   s the truth. Another thing, if we got bit by a red ant, my dad  chewed tobacco, and he   d take some of that cud out and put it on there   laughter . When I was about seven-years-old, a horse kicked me right here  and right here and laid this open. We were nine miles out in the country.  There used to be a doctor that was right down the street here. He happened to  be out to the farm east of us about a half a mile. Mother knew it, and she ran  to the phone and called them and told them that I   d been kicked and to keep  the doctor there and she   d bring me over. My dad had been sitting on the jury  in Arnett and just happened to walk in right after that happened, so they took  me over there. They got me up on a kitchen table, and he cleaned that out. Six  men got a hold of me and held me down and he sewed that up. I   ll never  forget that, as long as I have a mind. He was so proud of that. It doesn   t  hardly show really. Even when we ran the drugstore, he   d come in and he   d  say,    Sit down here. I want to see your left.     He wanted to look at his handy work. So no painkiller, no nothing?  No, he didn   t have anything with him.  23  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  He just sewed it up. Wow   I couldn   t get away, because I wasn   t too big. All these guys had a hold of me.  When you moved away, for several years I guess you were gone for     Twelve years.  Did you notice any big changes that had happened to the area since you had  been gone? You left in    35 just as the bad times were hitting.  This town wasn   t as active as it had been when we were growing up.  When we were growing up, especially Saturday night, this was a Saturday  town. They just came from everywhere.  When we were running this little caf   over here, we had a big run every  Saturday night of hamburgers. I had a grill about this long and this wide, and  it would be full of hamburgers for people coming in. We had a show down  here. They   d come in and eat supper. The other merchants would come over  and eat. Like he said, it was a good Saturday night town. It was even when  we ran the drugstore. We stayed open until after the show was out. Then  they   d come in and drink drinks.  You had a big soda fountain there?  One that was old fashioned.  Did you work it or did somebody else work it?  Well, we had help.  We had to have help. I was still farming. We had cows to milk.  When we had the caf  , I had three waitresses. I did all the cooking. I made  six pies every morning. By eleven o   clock I   d have my dinner brought up. I  did all the fry work, but I had three waitresses. When we decided to go into  the drugstore, one of those waitresses went with us. She   d been with us quite a  while and went with us to the drugstore. We didn   t know anything about  making drinks or anything. I didn   t know anything about a soda fountain. I  didn   t know anything about a caf   when I went in there either, but I hired  people that did. I told them I wanted constructive criticism. I knew how to  cook plain cooking, and that   s mainly the way I kept it. I said that I wanted to  know anything that I did wrong, so they   d tell me. Then we didn   t know  anything about a drugstore either. This girl that worked for us went to  Shattuck. We knew that druggist over there, and they had a fountain too. She  said,    Sit down here I want a recipe of how you do everything.    So she wrote  this down. When we   d get an order for a certain drink, we   d go over and look  at that recipe and fill it.  24  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  B. Brown  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Lemons  M. Brown  Kite  M. Brown  Kite  I always hear some of the big drinks from back then. Like black cows,  phosphates, and vanilla cokes, something like that. Do you remember any of  the popular concoctions that you would make up behind the counter?  Some of those kids would come in and they   d want a squirt of this and a squirt  of that and a squirt of something else. They   d want five or six squirts and  some carbonated water.  What   s a black cow?  That   s got chocolate in it, but I don   t remember really. It   s been a long time.  That   s been since    76. We use to have a bunch of oilmen. There was quite an  oil play in here at that time. They would be checking wells and go through a  lot, so they would stop. I even run into them occasionally now. We made real  good malts and shakes, because we made them real thick. They were in a can,  and we   d give them the can. They got a lot for their money. They still  remember that.  Another thing was the railroad. They   d call the depot manager and say,    We   ll  be there at twelve o   clock, have her have a fried chicken dinner for us.     There was a grocery store across the street, so I   d go over and get chicken. I   d  have a chicken dinner for them by the time they got here from Amarillo. I  served a little lunch every noon. You didn   t have a choice, but I had  something different every day. I always served a meat and potatoes and gravy.  What kind of a bargain price would you have for lunch?  I don   t remember what it was in the drugstore, but when we had the caf  , it  was 80 cents. That was your drink and a dessert and everything. And pies like  this that they get a dollar and a half or more now, we sold for fifteen cents.  Good deal.  This is the going price. I only paid my waitresses 60 cents an hour. I could  get a chicken for less than a dollar. Other prices were in comparison. Our rent  was  40 a month for that caf  .  It seems like it   s stayed about the same. Sixty cents an hour, and lunch was  eighty cents.  And a big steak would be about a dollar and a quarter.  I wish I could earn the money I earn now and go back   Laughter   -------  -------
