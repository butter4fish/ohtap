 Gill. Today is October 17th, 2008. I   m visiting with Ira  Scott from Houston, Texas and the Alumni Center on the OSU campus.  This interview is part of the O-STATE Stories Project which is part of  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Thank you for being  with us today.  It   s great to be here. It   s good seeing you.  You   ve got a long history with Oklahoma State University and the first  question I have got to ask you. Are you back for the OSU Black Alumni  Golf Tournament today?  Yes.  Did you shoot a good score? Did you have a good tournament today?  Hey, I had an enjoyable day. (Laughter) I had a lot of fun. Met a lot of  new old guys and new guys and just had a great time.  Let   s talk a little bit about your early life, your family life growing up.  Can you share a little bit of that with us?  Well, I was born in New Orleans and then my parents moved to  Houston, Texas when I was about five years old and that   s really where I  grew up, in Houston. All of my roots are in New Orleans. In Houston I  was educated in the public schools there. Both parents were school  teachers. I tried to play sports, football and basketball, but I seemed to  do a little better in basketball. So that was great because basketball is  really the main reason how I got to Oklahoma State University.  Can you tell us a little bit about the recruiting process, then? Mr. Iba  obviously was your coach?  5  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  That   s right. Well my first contact really with the Big Eight was through  Nebraska. (Laughs) The recruiter was at my school and talked to me  about attending Nebraska. That was quite a distance from Houston. It  was also cold and I grew up in a warm climate. I didn   t know about that,  I wasn   t real sold on it. I wanted to stay in Texas. However, during those  days, it was a sad time for me, I couldn   t attend the universities that I  wanted to attend in Texas due to the laws of the state and all of that at  that time. So Oklahoma State came to me through an individual in  Houston who was doing some recruiting for OSU.  Who was it?  Oh gosh, I don   t remember his name. I really don   t remember his name.  But anyway, he talked to me, and another one of my high school  classmates who also played basketball was also interested in going to  OSU and we decided together to come up to play basketball.  And who was your other classmate?  Chad Brown was his name. Yeah, Chad Brown played basketball also  for Iba. As I said, Nebraska was cold and Oklahoma wasn   t as cold.  (Laughs) I had some other schools I was looking at, but I wanted to get  out of Houston. Virginia Union was interested, but I didn   t want to get  too far from Houston because I wanted to be able to come back home on  the weekends or something. Unfortunately I didn   t do a very good job of  that because Stillwater is quite a distance from Houston   We   re talking about basketball and let   s pursue that a minute, I want to  get back to talk about your other OSU experiences, but who were some  of the guys that you played with? Was it fall when you came to OSU?  Yes. When I came up in 1963 that was when James King was here, Gene  Johnson, Larry Hawk, Paul Labrue, Freddy Moulder. That was the team.  I guess back then you couldn   t play as a freshman. So the next year in  1964, I think that was the year we won the Big Eight Championship.  Against Kansas?  That   s right.  Let   s talk about that. Can you recall, you started before you were out of  here, did you not?  Started on the team? Oh no, I wasn   t a starter. No, no, no. I played  center in high school and I came here and unfortunately I was kind of  earmarked to be a center here. Well I was only about 6   4    on the  6  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  program and those were the days when the 7-footers were just starting to  play but they weren   t very coordinated and I could hold my own with  those guys. But then when I came up against a 6   10    guy that was a little  athletic, it was tough. OSU wasn   t very tall during those days, so that  helped me. That was another good reason to come here. So that helped  and as a 6   4    center it was tough, but I could jump. (Laughs)  What was it like playing basketball for Mr. Iba?  Oh gosh, it was a humbling experience. (Laughter) Very humbling. I   ll  never forget, I think it was the third or fourth practice and he was  hollering and screaming and I was really getting down. The assistant  coach then was Sam Aubrey and he came over to me and said,    Son, if  you think this is bad, you should have been here about ten years ago  when he was younger and he   d kick you in the behind.    So I guess that  made me feel a little better (laughter) that I hadn   t been physically  abused. He was a tough coach, but a good coach.  Is it true that during Christmas season he would have three-a-days?  Three-a-days. We had to practice three times a day. Oh, it was tough. I  mean tough. Three times a day. Morning, afternoon, and night. And that  was very difficult, all you could do was eat, go to practice, and try to  survive.  We   re talking about the Kansas game; are there special games or  players that stand out in your memory?  (Laughs) Well, there were some special players. I really enjoyed playing  with Gene Johnson. Real good guy. We had some tough practices and  competition here on campus and I   ll never forget Larry Hawk, either.  This guy was a guard, but he was so quick. I don   t think I   d ever seen  anyone play that was that quick before. And then there was Paul LaBrue.  He was a big bruiser, he was slow. Paul, I   m sorry, (laughter) but he was  strong; he was a great guy to set a pick for you because it was like  hitting a brick wall.  You got to tell me about the Kansas game that won the Big Eight regular  season title.  Yeah, that was a big game for us.  Three overtimes?  Yeah something like that. I forget, it   s been so long ago. But we  prevailed and it was just great times. Great times for us. As a matter of  7  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  fact, I believe our team was the only one that ever won the Big Eight  championship. I   m not sure about that, but I   ve heard rumors of that.  Because you know, after that the conference was renamed Big XII and  OSU in the early days when it was Oklahoma A M, I don   t think was  really in the Big Eight.  Missouri Valley.  Missouri Valley, yeah.  You mentioned a couple earlier. Were there at that time African  American athletes beginning to play with major universities?  Yeah.  Did they have very many in your era on your team? You mentioned  James.  Oh yeah, we didn   t have many, but on my team it was James King, Chad  Brown, Freddy Moulder, and myself. That was about it.  Did you have some special friends that you hung out with? I mean the  other athletes, of course, Danny Lawson.  Well, of course there were other athletes on campus and Danny Lawson,  who you mentioned, was from Kentucky and we hit it off great. As a  matter of fact he   s in Houston today. We   re still great friends. George  Thomas was a football player from Oklahoma City. I still stay in  contact with him. He   s out in Arizona now.  Wardell Hollis?  Wardell Hollis was from Texas. San Antonio, Texas, I believe. And I  think he   s moved back to San Antonio.  From the D.C. area?  That   s right. From the D.C. area. He moved back about a year or so ago.  And then there were some players, some other football players here on  campus   they didn   t stay long   from Houston, even, on the football  team, but they only stayed a couple of years   one or two years.  Was there much social interaction between the white and the black  athletes?  Oh, not a lot. Just respectful. We didn   t really hang out if you weren   t  8  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  together a lot. But if there was an event to attend and we were expected  to be there, we   d be there. So we tended to stay in our own little worlds  and at first it was difficult for me, but I learned to deal with it. They  were just different because when I was in school in Houston, everybody  was one big happy family.  I guess that   s one of the things that you and I had some conversations  about, it was actually a little bit different. I   ll ask a couple of questions  about that. There weren   t as many African-Americans on campus.  No, that   s right. That   s right. That   s correct.  Looking at the academic side, what was your major?  Well, I started out majoring in physics. Then I backed off of it and  majored in math, but the reason I didn   t stay with physics is not because  I couldn   t make my grades. I really enjoyed it. What I found after getting  into the discipline was that my classmates that were in physics, they just  didn   t talk the same language that I talked. I wanted to talk about sports.  They were talking about equations. I wanted to talk about going out on  dates. Girls weren   t even in their minds. I don   t know if I met the wrong  ones, but I said,    Gee, if I can   t talk to these guys on a college campus,  how am I going to work with them down the road?    So I backed off of  that I had so many math courses that I decided to major in math. Didn   t  really know what I was going to do with it, but that   s what I did.  Can you remember some of professors that had an impact on you  personally?  I don   t remember any of my professors. And that was another thing, this  is a big school for a guy even from Houston, which was a large city.  Coming up here, I really   and maybe because of the athletics and it was  so demanding on my time, and then I had to study when I wasn   t  practicing or participating in a game. I really didn   t get close to many  professors. I don   t know if I even spoke to my academic advisor (laughs)  until I was maybe a junior and started getting serious,    Oh I need to  graduate. What am I going to do here?    So I didn   t really do that, I was  just another guy in the classroom and I made it through that way. It  would have been nice if I had a tutor or someone that was a little senior  to say something to me to help me out during tough times. As a matter  of fact, I can remember going to some classmates who were seniors and  maybe I was a freshman or a sophomore, and asking questions,    What  do you do? Do you take this class? Do you take that one?    My comfort  level was better with them than the professors on campus.  You might have answered this question with your comments earlier, but  9  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  did you have the opportunity to engage in any social activities?  Very, very little on campus. I did join a fraternity, however. That   s a  good story. There was an African American fraternity on-campus, Alpha  Phi Alpha. It was the only one on campus, so a couple of my good  friends who were athletes decided we were going to join the Alpha Phi  Alpha Fraternity because they had parties and we wanted to go to the  parties. We didn   t know what was involved to become a member of a  fraternity. We just knew that we needed to be a part of that group.  My father is an Omega. He   s an Omega Psi Phi. And I mean, strong  member of that fraternity. Well, somehow the word got out that I was  pledging Alpha (laughter) and he was in Houston, Texas. And believe it  or not, he made a trip from Houston to Stillwater. Looked for his son,  not only did he pull me off the line but also all of my buddies and said  you need to pledge Omega and that   s exactly what we all did. We had to  go through the Langston University Chapter and the grad chapter in  Oklahoma City, but that   s exactly what we did. By that time, we found  out what it took to become a member of a fraternity and we didn   t want  to go through that and the fact that we were pledges and we didn   t really  get to go to the parties and enjoy them. (Laughs) We were just workers  at the party and we couldn   t socialize, so we didn   t like that anyway.  And going this other route we could become a member without going  through a whole lot of headaches so that was a great deal. (Laughter)  Great story. Can you share some of your favorite hang outs on campus  and off campus? Where did you and your buddies hang out?  Well, on campus we really enjoyed the Student Union. Yeah, we really  did. The fourth floor of the Student Union, I think they had a jukebox on  the fourth floor. We   d go up and play cards and that   s where Friday,  Saturday nights we   d go and just enjoy ourselves on campus. Also, I  spent a lot of time in the library. It was a little quiet place. But that was  about it. Off-campus, not many places to go to off-campus.  During that era?  Yeah, yeah. During that era. That   s right. In that era, but I think there  was a little pizza place over here off of Sixth Street that we   d walk over  to. Didn   t have transportation. No car. Or if somebody did have a car,  maybe four or five of us would get in the car and we   d drive to Langston  University or Oklahoma City to a concert or something.  You were one of the early, not one of the say    pioneers    in the 1950s,  but certainly in the 1960s you were one of the first African Americans on  campus. There were not very many then. What was it like being black on  10  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  a predominately white campus? What were your experiences? Was it a  culture shock coming from Houston?  Yeah, well it was a culture shock coming from Houston, but it wasn   t as  difficult for me as I thought it possibly could be. One thing that I  realized was  that  I was well prepared education wise. I had had classes  in high school that many of the freshmen from Oklahoma had not had.  So I was ahead of many freshmen in math and science, so I felt good  about that. From the socializing standpoint, I didn   t really do a heck of a  lot of socializing in Houston, so that wasn   t a big deal here. But after  about a month or two, talking with my other high school classmates that  went to predominantly African America universities, and hearing all that  they were doing (laughter) and what I was missing out on, I was ready to  go back to Houston. I   ll be honest with you. I really was. My roommate  was Chad Brown. On Saturdays, sometimes we   d sit in the room  together and say,    Let   s go home. Let   s just pack up and go on back.  What are the guys doing at Texas Southern University? They   re having a  ball tonight.    But we decided to stick it out because after one semester,  some of those guys that were at that other school were back at home.  (Laughs) That was one thing we decided we were not going to do was  flunk out. We were not going to fail. And we didn   t.  Was it hard to find a date on campus?  (Laughs) Well, we didn   t have a lot of choices. Really didn   t. Didn   t  even   I don   t know that dating was even on the radar screen, it was  more just what do you do? Just social. What are you going to do? A date  meant that you needed money (laughter), a place to go (laughter), you  need transportation, maybe. We didn   t have money, we didn   t have  transportation. So we found that if we did meet some young lady that we  liked, we   d walk to the Student Union, or we   d walk to Theta Pond or  something like that. Or if there was a party on the weekend that the  Alpha   s were giving to other than Alpha Phi Alpha members, we   d go to  that. But that was about it. We really had to create our own  entertainment. As a matter of fact, we did, after a year we formed what  we called the Top Hat Club. Must have been about fifteen guys, we  called ourselves the Top Hats and we pooled out a little money together  and we would have parties. We would just make that happen. We   d find  somebody that had an apartment or a house and that   s what we   d do.  You had to build your own social network?  Build our own social network, our own activities. The university brought  entertainers to campus, nationally known entertainers on campus. Of  course, they were not people that we were really that interested in seeing  or hearing, so that was a downer. We tried but it was just a downer.  11  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  They university had big parties on campus at the Student Union, but of  course the music wasn   t the type of music we wanted to hear. So that  was a downer. So we just decided to take it upon ourselves and create  our own situation and then we had our own disc jockey and just made it  happen.  There were a lot of these disconnects for you and all of the African  American students on campus. Did you feel welcomed or accepted on  the OSU campus?  Well I think, yes, I felt welcome. I did. Especially because I was an  athlete. More people probably knew me than say just a guy that was just  here to study. So that wasn   t a bad situation. I never felt threatened or  anything like that. But I never felt like the environment was one that was  the most comfortable for me.  Reaching out to you?  Yeah, yeah. Things happen on campus and I had an option to go to it or  not and I eventually chose not to go, I just didn   t care for whatever it  was. I wasn   t a country western music lover. So when someone came to  campus that played that type of music, I probably wouldn   t attend.  Do you feel the atmosphere has changed on campus?  Well     Is it more welcoming and supportive campus?  Yeah, when I left Oklahoma State after I graduated, I really wasn   t that  interested in returning to Stillwater. I really wasn   t. I got out because I  had to get away. I graduated because I was on the radar. I needed to  graduate and I did that. So when I obtain that degree, I am gone. That   s  it. And then I went out and started working. Got involved with the OSU  alumni group in Houston and they were extremely welcoming. Just  brought me in and I just felt a part of that organization. Time and time  again, it was part of my social life. I don   t know why, I just felt good  about it and I stayed active with them and started coming back to  Stillwater as a result of that and it was at that time that OSU became  something special to me. It   s just grown on me over the years and I  decided that I wanted to help the university do whatever I could to make  it even better for kids coming up later.  I want to fill in the blank of when you left here and then I want to get  back to the Alumni Association. When you left here, can you give us your  career track?  12  Scott  Gill  Scott  When I left   well, I was in ROTC, I stayed through four years of that,  so when I left I had an obligation to go to the military and I joined the  Army   Air Defense Artillery. Left here went out to New Mexico to the  White Sands Missile Range working with antiballistic systems,  trajectories and firings. Did that for two years and obtained a job with  Exxon in Houston. So that gave me my ticket back to Houston. I used to  tell people after high school I was in Oklahoma, Stillwater and then I  was in El Paso then New Mexico and after all of that, Houston started  looking pretty good. (Laughter) So I went back to Houston and started  my career there in the systems arena, computer systems arena. I stayed  with Exxon for about twenty years and did very well with Exxon. Very  well. I was very high in the company when I left.  I   m trying to recall the conversation previously we had about the    Pay  at the Pump.    Can you share that?  Sure, sure. I was a computer systems manager for the marketing  department. I was on a business trip and I saw in a magazine that some  guy in Virginia some place gave his employee a credit card, or a plastic  card. The employee used that card to insert in a gate, to open a gate so  he could get into an area where there were gasoline pumps to fill up the  vehicles for the company. I looked around and Exxon didn   t have  anything like that and that was the first time I had ever heard of it. My  job then was to   I had about 300 people working for me. During those  days, the goal was to reduce people, do what you could with automation  to reduce your head count and I thought if somebody could generate a  transaction at that pump, rather than my employees keying them or  coding them or touching them then maybe I could save ten or fifteen  people in my group. So I proposed that through process to my boss; he  bought into it and before I knew it I was off on my own developing this  thing and reading and researching and the technology was coming.  Exxon had not bought into it, so I decided to take it on myself to kind of  get Exxon in the game. And I was successful with that. The first phase  of this thing was to capture these gasoline transactions at the source, as  far out into the source as you possibly could and transmit them back into  the accounting area electronically. So the first project was to do just that,  to get all of the data at the service station that you possibly could, rather  than send in those paper tickets back to an accounting center. So I  managed that project and did it, but before I did that I put together a  whole grand scheme and the flow charts. The ultimate goal was to use  that card and insert it into a gasoline pump. Way ahead of its time.  Exxon had looked at it but they shelved it away because they didn   t  think it was good idea at the time. But I pulled it off the shelf and made  it happen. I left that area, went out to the coal company. Had a nice job  over there, and then it brought me back to it to complete the jobs. So that  13  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  was my claim to fame was with Exxon.  So for all of us out here that use our Exxon Mobile card, you   re the IRS  guy?  The IRS guy, yeah. (Laughs)  So after 20 years you decided to go a different direction?  Well, marketing was not Exxon   s main forte. They were a producing  company, exploration and production. The marketing department was  never really just top notch in Exxon   s eyes. So it was declining and  that   s where my career path was, was in marketing. I could see the hand  writing on the wall, that at some point, Exxon wouldn   t necessarily be in  the marketing arena. Not with those folks. So I decided to leave and I  was right, eventually Exxon merged with Mobil and all of the Exxon  marketing folks, most of them left the company and Exxon picked up the  Mobil marketing people because they did a better job of marketing. So I  left before all of that happened and started my own business then.  I had a small business consulting company and within a year I turned  into a   it was a bus company and I had touring buses and I was able to  successfully negotiate a contract with the transit authority in Houston   METRO-Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Houston,  Texas  where I was actually managing a couple of the transit routes. I   d  lease my buses from the transit authority and I   d hire the drivers and  actually run those routes everyday   well, five days a week. These are  suburban routes and did that for about two years. Found myself working  20 hour days, 7 days a week (laughs) making money, but that wasn   t my  idea of something that I needed to do and I was trying to do it all myself,  really. Didn   t want to let go of anything.  So I eventually sold that company and started working with Brown    Root  now Kellog Brown   Root, KBR . They really made me an offer  while I had the company that I had; it helped me sell it because they  gave me an offer to work with them and part of the deal was that I had to  let my company go. They had a good package to bring me on and so I  said,    Ok. I   ll do it.    With them I was advising, helping. They had a  huge contract with the City of Houston to revamp all of their waste  water facilities and I was doing quality control and small contractor  development for Brown   Root under this contract with the City of  Houston. So that   s how I got from the gas business to the engineering  consulting business. As a result of that experience, Brown   Root  thought I could manage an engineering project and I eventually became  the program manager. It was a billion dollar program that I was a part of  at first. I eventually became the lead person for that program, for the  14  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  City of Houston. It was a great opportunity, a lot of work but I really  enjoyed that and I have stayed in that arena since that time. Left them  and went to another company, did the same thing and now I   m doing it  for myself. (Laughs)  Did any of your background at Oklahoma State University in terms of  your experiences here, like your athletic competition and your math  preparation, did that help prepare you?  Oh, there   s no doubt about it. What I found was being an athlete and  having the desire to make good grades, I had to manage my time. I had  to set priorities. I had to know when the exams were coming up, what I  needed to study, when I needed to study, and when I could play. So as a  matter of fact, I made my best grades during the basketball season  because I was forced to manage my time and do what I needed to do. I  found that as a result of coming to Oklahoma State, to the university  here that I was able   I could multi-task. I could do a number of things at  the same time and keep track of them.  So it definitely helped me because after you get out of school, you may  have some basic school and knowledge, but there are a lot of other  things that the university doesn   t teach you, like how to deal with  people. I guarantee you that the impact that Hank Iba had on me, yeah  he was a tough coach, but I learned self-control. I learned how to take  the heat and wait for the right opportunity to fire back. I learned how to  talk to other people in a nice tone as opposed to   I didn   t want to be a  Hank Iba. (Laughter) That   s right, so it was those types of things that I  really felt were based right here on campus.  Coming back to Houston and moving, you   ve been involved with  political government affairs. Can you share just a little bit? I know for  example, you were an influence in helping elect the first black mayor  of  Houston ? Can you share a little bit about that with us?  Sure, when I was with Brown   Root, they had this contract with the  City of Houston, and one of my jobs was to help the city increase the  number of small businesses that were doing city work. This was a billion  dollar program and there were not enough known contractors in Houston  to do that work. The city wanted local businesses to get involved, so we  needed to expand the pool of businesses to do that work. Well, what we  found was that there were other companies that could do the work, but  they just weren   t interested in doing city work, or they didn   t know how  to do some of the work. So my task was to help them with training and  education and letting them know that a plumber could export his skills  as a plumber to lay a four inch pipe in the ground or water line for the  city, that type of thing.  15  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Well, when you start working with the City of Houston, you   re  automatically into the political process. Well, my knowledge   I had a  huge knowledge base of the engineering construction industry in  Houston because of that job. Lee Brown  three-term Houston mayor  1998-2004  was getting ready to run for mayor and I met him. Someone  thought that my knowledge was good for him to have on his team so I  got involved with that. That   s when I got involved with the political  process, I mean really into it. Out speaking and campaigning and he  eventually was elected mayor of Houston.  And Dan Lawson was in the campaign?  Yeah, and Danny Lawson   he was the friend from Kentucky and he  was a big fundraiser for Lee and a strategist for him. So we eventually  won the battle; he was elected mayor and he picked me to be a member  of the board for the Transit Authority and I was elected the Vice  Chairman of the Transit Authority for that Houston-Harris County area.  I held that position for five years and during that time, of course politics  was the name of the game and I had a job at the time. I   m in this arena  but we had to stay focused on the goal again and that was we wanted to  build a light-rail system in Houston. This for the transportation   a train  system. And of course there was opposition and I was the lead person to  talk up the rail system and again, we won that battle even through  lawsuits and court appearances and bad press and being on television,  but we got through it all and the rail line is now running in Houston, so  we   re really pleased with it. And of course as a result of being involved  politically, I   ve been involved throughout the country and in other cities  where because of the contacts we   ve made and that   s part of the reason  I   m doing some of the work I   m doing today in New Orleans because I  had contacts down there.  Was it two years ago when Arts and Sciences recognized you and gave  you the Distinguished Alumni Award?  That   s right.  Was that special for you?  That was very special. I mean, very very special. Heck when I was on  campus, I don   t know if they even did that or not but I   m sure there were  some students from the College of Arts and Sciences that were  acknowledged as being distinguished or may have called them  something else, but I didn't know anything about it. So when I was asked  to do that, I said,    Oh no, I   m not distinguished. That   s not my deal.     And they said,    Oh yeah, we think you are,    and da da da. So I agreed  and part of the package was I needed to come up and speak to the  16  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  graduating students from the College of Arts and Sciences. Great  evening, great day, great time. I really enjoyed it. I really appreciated the  opportunity to share my story.  Well congratulations. Back to our conversation earlier and then maybe  we   ll pursue a little more your continued ties with Oklahoma State. You  talked about John Cathey and the leadership roles in the Houston area  at that time. They had some great leadership, but you   ve maintained  especially close relationships with the Alumni Association and served on  it, I think, as the chapter president.  I was the president of the Houston chapter for a number of years. I had  just started out with guys saying,    Come on, let   s go to this meeting     and I did and I really liked them. You mentioned John Cathey and there  were others down there that just kind of pulled me in and before I knew  it I was involved and I was the president of the Houston Chapter.  And didn   t someone visit with you about coming onto the National     (Laughs) That   s right  I think then Jerry Gill said,    You need to be on  the National Board of Directors of the Alumni Association.    So I did  that. I used to come back to Stillwater quite a bit for those meetings and  one of the things that I did down in Houston, we never back in those  days, we couldn   t see the OSU football games and I said,    We ought to  be able to get these football games televised in Houston.    We couldn   t  get them televised but I worked a deal with the athletic department   I  guess the local Oklahoma television station was televising or taping the  football games, and they would ship a tape to me on Sunday, I   d receive  it on Monday and on Monday evening I   d get the alumni group in  Houston together and we   d find a club or some place in Houston that  was large enough to hold us all. And that   s when we   d watch football     the Saturday football game. They   d put it on a bus, as a matter of fact,  and send it on down so that   s how we   d come together every Monday  after OSU football games. We   d watch the game.  And you worked to get the radio station?  Yeah, we sure did. Thanks for reminding me of that. We worked to get a  radio station to carry it and that happened, we never knew which one  it  was broadcasted on . (Laughs) From year to year, and the quality wasn   t  the best, but I guarantee you that there were some OSU fans sitting  around the radio listening when they could. So it was a good deal, good  deal.  You take special pride and this is sort of full circle, the OSU Black  Alumni Association. You   re the charter president?  17  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Yeah, that   s correct. First I was president of the local chapter in Houston  of the OSU Alumni Association and there were some folks here in  Stillwater that wanted to start an OSU Black Alumni Association. Some  of the faculty were involved in that and I received a call about an  organization meeting. I came up to Stillwater and we talked about it and  they put together the original mission and governing principles, and then  tapped me into being the first president of the organization of the OSU  Black Alumni Association.  Is there a special sense of pride for you in that?  Remember when I said earlier there was something missing when I was  on campus. I thought that having this Black Alumni group would help  some students during those days to be closer to the university. You  know, kids come to the campus and they all have something that they  matriculate to. Something, whether it is the band, studies, the library, a  dorm; something that they really have to take interest in. And you never  know what that   s going to be, but if you have those opportunities  available they   ll choose one. I think it has helped retention. Also,  because I had to look and hunt, we formed the Top Hat Group and that  was   so after going home for the summer, I was looking forward to  coming back and being with my buddies in the Top Hat Group.  Ira, was one of your first priorities in the Black Alumni Association  scholarships too?  That   s correct. That was really the priority originally to do that. The  faculty was concerned about that aspect and I must admit that I shared  that interest with them, but I was more concerned about socializing. So I  was walking a fine line between alumni and scholarships. I had to really  be careful because there were some in the organization that wanted to  focus only on scholarships and I kept saying,    Well look, if you get  some socialization here, you may be able to raise some money for those  scholarships.    That   s how we were able to get it going early on.  And again, speaking candidly, I remember being a part of these  discussions within the Alumni Association. Not everybody on our Board  of Directors favored having a separate Alumni Association for African  Americans. Do you remember those conversations?  I remember those conversations. I remember many of those  conversations and I know that if we hadn   t been strong and presented a  good argument and had we not had the support of Jerry Gill, it probably  would not have happened.  Remember the first time we tried    (Laughter)  18  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  That   s right and today, I think you have many organizations like that  now. (Laughter)  American Indian  Native American Alumni Association .  That   s right.  I think now most people recognize that it really is a great organization  and outstanding     Right, right.  The things it does and today is seems like a no-brainer but it wasn   t a  no-brainer when it started.  No it wasn   t. It really wasn   t. You never know when in a person   s life  they   re going to get involved with the Alumni Association. It may be  golf, it may be a trip, it may be a football game, it may be something that  the Alumni Association is putting on and they see a name and say,    I  want to see that guy.    Maybe a person. So that   s why I keep saying, you  have to present those options for people and keep trying and keep trying  and eventually in a person   s life I guarantee you they   re going to show  up at least once.  Ira, conversations of some of the early alumni from the 1950s and the  early 1960s over the Black Alumni Association was not always as  positive as it should have been. There are some feelings there. Do you  remember saying one time    Just get over it   ?  (Laughs) Yeah, just get over it.  That   s to say because of your relationship over the years and how your  relationship has changed over the years.  That   s right. Yeah, I found something that I was interested in and as a  result of that something, it grew to other areas of interest and it   s  healthy. And after all, this is the university that I graduated from. Not  any other one. This one. (Laughs) When I see my buddies who  graduated from other universities just having great fun with their alumni  groups, this is me so I have to, I have a choice really and I   ve got to do  it.  Ira, a couple of final thoughts here. There   s Ira Scott, the tough,  determined student athlete that was 6   4    trying to survive in a 6   11     world. The good student, the young black man that succeeded in a white  man campus environment, quite frankly. Successful businessman; astute  19  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  Scott  Gill  political person; fraternity leader; mentor; family man, and individual  who has given freely of his time and his talent. Who   s the real Ira Scott?  Who   s the real Ira Scott? I think the real Ira Scott, after all these years, is  a person that really likes to get involved in the community or people  things. I really believe that. I really like to organize people or get them  motivated to accomplish something. I found that I was at my best in jobs  in my career when I was the manager of a group and I had to motivate  people. I didn   t think I was that type of person when I was much  younger. But it was really due to Exxon and my experience with the  OSU Alumni Group that caused me over time to recognize that my true  purpose is to deal with people and help get them motivated and to do  whatever it is that we need to do and overcome negative thoughts,  negative feelings. And in all cases, everything that I   ve ever worked in  or been associated with, those types of feelings come out and I have  been able to overcome them in some way, even with OSU.  I   ll never forget when I got involved with the Black Alumni Association.  I was not exposed to some of those negative experiences that other  students were exposed to. And they had some deep rooted negative  feelings about the university. I   m traveling Oklahoma trying to  encourage graduates to get involved with the alumni group, trying to  encourage Oklahoma students to come to Oklahoma State University  and I kept getting hit with  people saying ,    Why would you do that for  that university in Stillwater? They did       I had never heard of that and I  had to overcome that. I helped form a Black Alumni Chapter in Tulsa,  Oklahoma that was composed of a number of those people that had bad  experiences. I said,    We   re going to do something different here.     Was Reuben Gant one of those?  That   s right. That   s right. And we   re going to do something different.  We   re going to create what we want and that   s what we did. So they  started coming back to campus and enjoying it.  You talked about the real Ira Scott here. How do you hope people  remember you at OSU? Your education, your experience. How do you  hope OSU will remember you?  Oh, just a dedicated guy that truly wants individuals to succeed, that   s it.  I   m just dedicated to that. If I don   t make it but you do, I   m fine with  that. Because you made it. We made it. One of us made it. And I try to  pass that along as far as I can to as many people as I can.  What is the thing that is so special to you  about  Oklahoma State  University? You put Oklahoma State University on the line for years and  20  Scott  Gill  Scott  years and years, first as a student-athlete and then for years in  leadership. What is it to you that is so special about Oklahoma State?  I think it was the people. The people that I met after I left the university,  I felt that they were just the best people I had ever been involved with.  And that   s what kept me coming back and I tell others today that I may  not have enjoyed my experience while I was a student, but after I got out  of the university and I started working, the OSU family was just great to  me and me to it. I just really enjoyed the people that I met that were also  students at the university. That was the number one thing and it helped  me in my work life, with my career, it helped me in my political life, and  it certainly helped me as I got involved with the Alumni Association.  Final question. Now, you did turn in a fair score at the golf tournament  today, didn   t you?  (Laughter) Yeah, it was fair   -------  -------
