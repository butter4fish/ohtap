Speaker 1: Would you please share with us your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food.  Oh, I would say that if you were to ask that question of my children they think that I am going to sprout feathers and scales because I tend to eat poultry and fish the most, but I would say chicken, I really do like chicken.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I have a favorite color.  I tend to like bright colors, but if I were to select one it probably would be a variant of blue.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, you can't ask me that.  Remember in the travel and tourism industry.
Speaker 1: (Laughs).  Everywhere in the U.S., right?
Speaker 2: Yes, every place in the U.S. and its territories.  (laughs).
Speaker 1: Your favorite phrase or saying?  Do you have one?
Speaker 2: I think everyone else could answer that most but I don't recall if I have one.  Dexter probably could tell me, but I don't know if there's--I--it was interesting if I may they--had a surprise reception in here for me last week and they had on there expressions and words that are used almost exclusively by me.  It was by my staff and there were words on there that were fairly common to me--but I'm not certain if there is a favorite expression although there might be a combination of that.

Speaker 1: Let's begin talking about your mother, starting with your mother's name and where she was born and where she grew up as a girl?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's name is Josephine Cleo Woods is the maiden name, Norman, and I know this from just having done some research last night that she was born in January of 1911 in a little area called Mackee (ph.), North Carolina.  She grew up--she was in that area and subsequently went to high school.  She--she did not go to college.  She was--was perhaps one of those very wonderful kind of mothers who at the time was very attentive to her children.  We lived in an environment that she--created a nurturing environment but the thing that is most interesting about it is I always remember with my mothers--I never knew until after I'd grown? a long time ago how relatively poor we were because in the environment in which we lived and what happens to others, we consider ourselves as having a comparatively enriched, however as insular  it may be life.  She was a homemaker, she worked as a domestic in--in trying to assist in the family income and that's what she did for most of her life until her death.
Speaker 1: And did she ever tell you any stories or talk about what life was like for her growing up, like the things that she enjoyed doing and--and what she did as a child?
Speaker 2: My mother and--with some bias, was very attractive.  She always--and she is a very--was an extraordinarily extroverted individual and so much of the things that would expect that would be associated in that kind of environment as being the--the fairly extroverted person.  In trying to remember with her parents she was in a--a situation her father, which I have now discovered was a--given my background is something I wish I had felt this on earlier was a sleep car porter and back in the period of--of A. Phillip Randolph and at the time that had been involved in some of the unionizing.  He had as I understand it had lost his job because he was gonna get involved with that, but during those days the railroad car Pullman, although it--in ordinary American standards was not very well, they were doing comparatively well in that regards, but she had a good life as I indicated.  She did what most of the individuals around--not from the ordinary point of view of being an exceptional human being, but in terms of the kind of values and the feelings that she had about life and dedication to the children were something that was very important I think.  Something that as you think about it, the things I remember was a kind of nurturing environment with the caring that she had that transcends almost other things I can remember.
Story_ID: 11428
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your father starting with his name and where he was born and where he grew up as a boy.
Speaker 2: My--my father was born in--in February of 1900.  He too grew up in an area called, I believe Roper, North Carolina, and the reason why this is so significant is that his father was a land owner at the time, which during the Civil War was extraordinarily unusual and was a--was not a slave.  His--it turns out that his wife, my grandmother, was a direct descendant of American Indians, in fact, who had lived on a reservation and so the connection between them is that as an independent person who had some land which was really a big deal and that was sort of the history, but my--my father that is his--his background and from which they have come and he was a person who had grown up in farming.  He--my father had a worth--work ethic that just was what you would have expected from someone.  He worked very, very hard all of his life.  He had--and he left there and there were--what made a big change in his life is he has told me is that they were building the Alba--across the Albemarle Sound a bridge which is really a at that time a kind of a marvel for the long bridge that it was, and he left the farm and the environment to work on this bridge which was not that far away and it was based upon this building and all the others that he got kind of interested in some of the building things and was able subsequently to get a job with the federal government, with the U.S. Navy in the Norfolk area which is how my life got caught up in there and so--but that's what he did for those years.  He was a carpenter and worked there until he retired and then after  that used--sort of used his carpentry work to help out in some--he was particularly--he was a very religious man and as was both of my parents and would do things like assist churches in doing some building and so on and until he died at I believe at ninety plus.
Story_ID: 11429
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: My understanding--I don't know the precise story but I do know that they lived in other areas and according to my mother and father they were hopeless romantics and the one thing that I remember is that when he met her, he was the equivalent by our standards today a--a very kind of conservative laid back person but doing that day I think he was considered sort of the playboy type in her and he saw her at some church function and my understanding is that they fell in love immediately and decided that's what it's gonna be and I think that to the best of my knowledge I don't think she ever had anyone that she was very serious about except him and vice versa, and so their lives were entwined and it was remarkable for us because they--I remember one of the things that was most interesting is that in their entire lives they never spent a night apart and once they were married as I understand it which was really kind of not happening, so I was always concerned that if something were to happen to one or the other of them that they would not survive very well without it and of course unfortunately my mother died of a heart attack and--and he subsequently I guess for another twenty years. So it's not as dire as I thought, but they were very, very close, very much interdependent, very much work with another, extraordinarily family oriented.  Their lives were built and centered on their children.
Story_ID: 11430
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your grandparents.  Did you know your grandparents?  Did you spend time with them?
Speaker 2: I remember my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Which, paternal or maternal?
Speaker 2: My--my paternal grandmother and the reason for that is that every summer we lived in a urban area in here and we would go to visit my grandmother.  Her name was Sally.  I always remember that and she was also, for someone who had been reared at that time in a relatively segregated environment, with just all African Americans, it was always kind of unusual because she was the--her look, her style--she was aging, but her hair was always jet black, it was what you would expect of a person who had been born and was Indian and we use to always talk about my grandmother and her Indian ways and how-- to--that's--what about--what was it like on the reservations or what was it--.
Speaker 1: What would she tell you?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting that's in here because she actually had moved away from the reservation.  Her parents were there.  All of her relatives, her aunt and uncles and they would still go to visit.  In fact, my mother, my father and my aunts and others would--one of their things from their fond memories being taken over and meeting people from the reservations, you know was kind of interesting, but in her particular case she--if my memory is correct, my father's father was or had become a minister.  I'm not certain what they were at that particular time and so in that particular case what was so interesting about it is that her culture, her background and all such she had a love for history and so I remember I would visit with her and do things such as run in the fields.  We lived near this big sound that for me was like visiting an ocean because it was more a greater expansive water than I'd ever seen before and--and it was kind of a freedom.  A freedom in which we--and then we would sit on the porch and she would tell us stories and vice versa and so my recollection of her is this wonderful sage woman who seemed to know a great deal about everything, who had infinite patience and wanted to hear everything you wanted to say about everything and of course it was her desire, she always thought that I should be a minister and so she would read to me from the Bible and we would talk about things and--and she was always fascinated by this and I'm not certain if because of her or not but I had gone to a--early on because it was something to do for the summer and my--and something called a vacation Bible school and I was of a comparatively good student and I became interested in--in scriptures more from a philosophical and a point of view of almost esthetics because it was beautiful the way in which it rhymes.  I--I learned at this school and they would have these contests and for me it was always--I was competitive and had to learn that. I learned chapters and chapters from the Bible for which I am always surprised that even to this day I can think of one and it will just come out and then a part of me, but my grandmother was always and she would--we would sit on the porch and with the animals and some of the other things around and others and then her lap and she said quote this to me and then she would get a great deal of--course she saw it as something much more profound as a young minister and all the others that have nothing to do with that, but that is the recollection I had and--and she would always talk about the importance of pride of wanting to--and I think this is where from some of her background in this regard, but she was very concerned about that you would always want to be the best that you can be and--and she would say, "remember that", always be proud, be proud of what you are and--and then it's kind of interesting because her background was not coming quite from an African American experience but from an experience noted into a lot of other things and for her the thing that I remember most was concepts about being proud of what you are and--and what you can become.
Speaker 1: And you had mentioned earlier that I think your father grew up on a farm.  So when you would go during the summer you'd spend time on the farm, what was that like coming from an urban environment?
Speaker 2: Well, it was fascinating and one of the reasons why I think young people today who live in urban areas should have that kind of an experience because you move from a relatively hustle, bustle environment to a very open environment. They owned, at the time which I thought was the largest farm any place in the world.  They had about a few hundred acres.  Now, it is not--it's mostly trees and all the other sort things here now but they owned, it and goes back and so it was a really--and so we would go there and walk through it.  They had animals on there.  They had--they farmed the land.  They had all kinds of things and it was an area in which they had the water--that you had to pump the water to go out and you learned to feed the animals and go through the various regiments, but what I remember most about it is that it was a very tranquil environment.  The kind of environment in which you could actually walk out and you wouldn't see a neighbor any place except that where she lived they had some children who lived maybe three quarters a mile down and so that if you stand up at her house you wouldn't see another house any place around and it was that--it was a time of very--of contemplation and for me it was--what I enjoyed most is that--what I never thought that much about it is many of the opportunities to just be free.  I'd run around with the dog.  I'd--and most of the time there were not--go and see some other children but I loved--I loved the tranquility and it was probably one of my more reflective moments as a young person.
Story_ID: 11431
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?  What--what are like one of the very first things that you remember?
Speaker 2: I--I remember going to school for the first time so I can think about that and trying to think about periods earlier than that.  I lived in--this was in Norfolk, Virginia.  I lived in a housing project and called Oak Leaf Park and I remember the children in my neighborhood, and I doubt if I would see any now, though I--to my pleasant surprise I ran into a couple and I went--so the recollections and memories that I have is of that neighborhood.  It was a neighborhood in which for entertainment you go down at the end and there was a park area.  The park area had a sprinkler and which water would spew out in all various directions and--and almost everyday in the summer you'd go there and play sports and play--run around with one another and it was one of those things in which--in neighborhoods in which no one locked their doors.  It was--and--it was almost--it was about as close to--it was primarily African American--there may have been some individuals but if they were, they were people of colors like from Puerto Rico or some other kind of places, but it was primarily that kind of a--a community and--but that's the recollection there and then going to--to starting to elementary school and thereafter from that environment.
Speaker 1: And can you kind of continue describing your community for us a little bit?  What--what did the houses look like and--?
Speaker 2: It's interesting because I--I remembered taking my children by there to see their father's roots, and they--it has not changed and they've done some--but the area is still there.  Basically, I'm trying to remember it well--this house which I now remember is 1971 Oakleaf Drive only because I looked this up last night, but what I remember most is four things in this memory.  There were these row of homes and all the things in the unit.  At the end of the unit there was a one switch I remember that could the power on and off and of course, as all kids you always knew where that switch was and on Halloween that sort of things would happen in each front of the there was interestingly a coal bin.  It was a wood thing with a kind of concrete and wood on the top and--and so because the furnace was coal and coal would be delivered and I remembered the days we'd have to get it from the curb--get it over to the coal bin and then you would keep in--because that's how it was burned.  The yard, we had a relatively small yard but you had your own plot--yard plot. There was a clothes line that came along for which the clothing were washed and of course we didn't have washing machines and so on but you had all the things that would do that and I remember clothes on the--we had grass.  We always--we kept it because we made certain the grass stayed green and little plants with tomatoes and our little--I guess if you took the entire yard it would not be as large as--as this--our little section of here and in the front and there was a back and then there was a front and the front had some little bushes and grass and so we--I remember--remember as a young person--everyone had the same plot--we use to get a lawnmower and cut grass.  I remember it twenty-five cents for the yards, front and back but--but that was kind of what it looked like and it was--it was very modest except for us my mother was a dedicated homemaker so we--even though there were all of her children in here we--and over there was--we always kept things clean.  She was one of those individuals that--the thing I can remember most about her is every morning--always made the beds.  I mean you had--you never would leave the bed--and then she was not neatness for the sake of neatness but she was a very ordered person.  Perhaps I've gotten some of that.
Story_ID: 11432
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about what holidays were like in your house growing up?  Were they very special occasions like Christmas and Easter and Thanksgiving?
Speaker 2: I can remember my mother and father had very strong religious underpinnings so holidays that were associated with anything religious took on added importance and in the order in which I can remember that they occurred, Easter was--was really significant not only in terms of the religious aspect but it was a time in which you remember you could get new clothing and the clothing came interestingly there was this Sears & Roebuck's--I can't imagine I can remember that, in which she would actually order things from a catalogue and they would come in and in time that we could have whatever it is, it wasn't much that we were--as I indicate in spite of the fact that my father worked for the Naval shipyard, it was not--it was clearly at the lower level category.  He was the thing that made it cutters that it was steady and etcetera and I remember that--trying to recall at that time we would at Easter--you always went to church and there, there was not a question as to whether or not you would go.  We went there to Sunday school and so on and in fact I--I was have always been comparatively a relatively outgoing individual and so because of my interest in those things I had--I'm not certain that how you would describe leadership, but I tended to be--either pushed to or placed into the forefront, but it's interesting to note that that was never my predilection and so I would end up--I remember if I may, you asked me--let me just finish--please (unclear) my apologies, I'm diverting.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: Holidays were important.  Christmas, Easter.  They were very important, and they were important not only before the--the significance of the holiday but for all the things that went along with it, and it was a time of sharing.  I can't imagine a situation in which the family would not be together in those circumstances.  We had neither the resources to go on long trips and things but when we did things, there was a way of making them together.  It would not be unusual for my mother and father to get a--that little park I was telling you about--Easter egg hunts and they would get their little eggs and take the families with everybody and all the others.  There was a community center and we did things around it but basically for--for the family there was always time--breakfast--if you were there for lunch or for dinner or whatever it was, you always did it as a family.  There was not, as you do today, you--your time--you were gonna be there so we--we had a certain kind of structures but at the same time it was one of those things in which I--I would dare say that even with extraordinarily limited resources, there was not--everything that they had was oriented towards the children.  I mean it was--so we always thought that we were living much better comparatively because we had the parents who were always--always caring except in today's standard it might be considered very meager.
Story_ID: 11433
Speaker 1: You were talking earlier about some of your experiences in church.  Your oratory experiences.  Can you elaborate on that a little bit more?
Speaker 2: Well I--I--I meant that one is from the earliest stages on, I was telling you about this vacation bible school and one of the things that part of it is--what's kind of interesting about this is that it was always who can learn the most and who can recite it and do that so in spite of what the intent was, I tended to rise to those sort of things.  So no one was going to learn more scripture, more this or to be able to do it more.  As an example I just found a picture last evening which I had not recalled until this particular moment, but I was nine years old and they had a contest among the cities in elementary schools about children reading books and who could read the most books and prepare a report in the city for all the city elementary schools and they had this picture here of me winning first prize.  It was, you know, for me asking me to read, it's like saying the old proverbial "throw me in that tar patch".  I--I enjoyed reading, I--I--if it didn't move I would read it and recollections that my parents would have as--there's a radio and I would listen to the radio with a--with a book and--and I loved sports.  I loved all the other things, but when others would go back and do certain the things--that was pre-TV I might add--listening to the radio and all the stories and--and reading was important, so I remembered--remember that and I think that part of it is not only because I read and it wasn't so much a question of fantasy, but the world around me became so much enlarged, but I was going to tell you the other story interestingly and you just made me think about it.  In my--in my elementary school, they had something every May called a May king and queen and for some particular reason, and they would have all these festivals.  The parents would come and they'd have this May day, whatever it is and then they'd crown the king and queen and for three years, in kind of like the first, second and third grade, I was the May king and I found that and--and I always remembered--so the fourth year this was on, I was really feeling badly because I didn't--what I wanted to do was to do the Maypole, to do the things and all the other things that same year.  So I decided--what made it difference you had to wear--I always remember a white shirt and a white pants and they put this little thing in your hand, and so this day I wore all the things and decided I was not going to be the May king and I--it was very disturbing.  The teachers were--I said, I didn't realize that-- well you know, that you're gonna be--I--I actually did realize it but I--it is--it is when I learn something comparatively about myself, you know I aspire to achieve and I'm comparatively competitive, but I have long have gotten a great sense of satisfaction in watching things occur and be a part of making them occur as necessarily being in--in the forefront for all of it.  Dexter will tell you that much of that has not changed now, but--but the point is, is that whatever kind of represents leadership characteristics, I always never was hesitant to step forward and to do things, so--so for that particular period it's perhaps a much--as much a consequence as being willing to do that as being selected and--and often it was selected because I would standby often.

Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up and remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds, smells?  Smells, my mother was a superb cook.  She loved to bake.  She had this notion that you're not supposed to buy bread from the store and to do that and so--out playing and so one we had a screen door and you could come by and run by and see if it's time to eat and about this time we were doing that I remember the sounds of the young person doing that.  The smells--that's smells.  Sights.  I am not certain if there are any sights that take on any particular importion--proportion about my childhood.
Speaker 1: Water at all?
Speaker 2: Water?  Is an interesting one for my early childhood because you noticed I remembered the--the sprinkler.  The sprinkler as a gathering place and it was a very enriching environment because everyone would run over and what came as close to a swimming suit as you could possibly have around here and watching the (deer?) and we also lived in an area, kind of a wooded area in which at that time there was water going around and you were not supposed to go out there and--and there was a place at the end where you could go crabbing out on the--it's part of the Chesapeake Bay and there was a pipe that came in across and you could walk across this pipe for which the memory that I have is my mother saying why you shouldn't do this and etcetera.  Why you shouldn't go over there and remembering the time at which I thought there was some ice and tried to walk across and of course the inevitable happened, but I remembered when I think of water in that regards.  Sounds would be--I'm not certain if I know what sounds is in there except the--I really enjoyed music and the radio at the time and I really can't begin to imagine how much time I spent listening and fantasizing and etcetera.
Story_ID: 11436
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite--did you like to listen to radio programs or did you like music, and like what were your favorite forms of music and songs and?
Speaker 2: It's interesting.  I really unlike most, I was as much of a little boy as I could possibly be.  I would--in sports I did all the things.  I played all the teams.  I was in and out of everything.  I would not consider myself to be an exceptional athlete but I was quite good.  I was fast, I could do all the other things, but the difference is my friends use to always say about me at the time.  I really don't understand it because we're all together and we're doing all the things, but I was always a student.  It came easily and when you talk about the radio and others I liked a potpourri of things.  It was never this, in fact if it was something for which I had not had exposure to I was more inclined to want to listen, so when someone would say, what do you listen to on the radio they would not only be stories but--but news accounts, things of that particular nature.  Music, I actually have had a focus change in music in which I probably knew what was popular and so on but I learned to, as I became increasingly older, to like quiet music and--and I think part of why I like that is when I had my moments alone and away from everyone and I would read and so on, you would want something soft in the background and so that--that probably was more of an influence rather than turning something on to just listen to it solely on.  I have always been and probably still will be as long as I can recall a multi-tasker, so it--the notion of just sitting and listening to the radio or even when the TV came around in which I then remember the first time that happened where it was always I was doing something.  Some combinations of things together.
Story_ID: 11437
Speaker 1: What is the name of the elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: Richard Allen Tucker Elementary School and the reason why I remember it is I did something.  I think I could not have been anymore than my first or second--I was in this--they were making this sign of the school--the initials and they had the students in there and I remember with my first grade teacher--I made the comment "we can't do that, that spells R-A-T", and--now why I would have looked at that but I was standing back on this little thing and I could see it and so--and of course it became a joke around everything at Richard Allen Tucker which is probably why I remember the rat.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Yes, there are some things that I remember about it.  This was a different time and teachers at that particular moment taught because they had education, in fact it was very rare that they would not have an advanced degree but they--they--it--the opportunities were so limited that they put their heart and soul into this and so with the children and so we had teachers that not only were very, very good teachers, but tend to be teachers who were part of the community and--and if you were a teacher--I mean you were really in an comparatively exalted position within the community.  What I remember most about teaching and the teachers is that I was always a good student.  It came comparatively easy to me.  I was sort of outspoken but I was--I actually--and--and they would often involve me in things if there was a school play.  I was always going to be selected to be in the school play if there was this or--or for the others there was a principal in here and I remember something happened to me in elementary school.  I think I was about in the probably no more than the fourth grade, and they had this oratorical contest for which I didn't want to participate because I never thought I was that good of a speaker but I could memorize anything and I think that I was selected more because I could memorize whatever happened and--and we went over to do this and I practiced with these teachers and so on and I finally went over for this contest and I gave mine probably as well as I was able to--to give it and the--and when I came--but another person won.  I came in--I don't remember second, third or something like that.  I can't recall it, but I remember the principal coming in and she was--she said, they all called me "William" at the time.  She says "William, you did very well.  I'm so proud of you," and she says and "I thought that you were really the best." and I said, oh, no she really deserved it (unclear), in fact if I had to vote I would have voted for her and I remember she started crying and I say--I thought I--what could I have said, and--and it was a story that I remember many years later I ran into her and that's the story that she remembers and was telling me about it but it was the kind of school in which everyone knew one another.  It was really a sense of neighborhood in here.  I was--if there was something to be involved in, I probably was involved in it.  I was more than likely among the top students from a grade point of view in the school and comparatively popular, very outgoing, but a mixed life.  A mixed life in which I think it is a fair statement to make that if there was any activity, football, basketball, kickball running around, all the things that you could do within that particular neighborhood, it took place, but it was very careful because my mother and my father were always very careful about the--they wanted to know what we were doing and were so involved so we could be gone but you always had to kind of make it clear where you were.  So if some--I really didn't get the opportunity to get into some of the trouble that some of the others may have gotten into because mother was kind of had these sort of rules and regulations, but I also was very reflective and when like most I would I--I always use to like quiet moments to get away and that's kind of--and I think in--in school through all of my elementary schools in here I was--if you would look at kind of the scrapbook over there, if there was an activity I generally was in or around or in some way associated with it and not--more because it was--it was what I did and we got selected in my school I was you know really like the president of my class, not because I was necessarily the most popular or anything else but you know, Bill Normal was perceived the person who could kid and play around but would--would get things done.

Speaker 1: You had talked a little bit about the things you like doing in your spare time of sports.  Did you shoot marbles?
Speaker 2: Oh, did I not only shoot marbles, I was really good at it.  In fact, I actually won a--they had these city-wide competitions--.
Speaker 1: City-wide marble competitions shooting marbles?
Speaker 2: Competitions and--now this was in the African American community in here but you--you get in there and I would--I loved to shoot marbles and--and the problem is I was not the best marble shooter but I was winning because I could--I was more strategic and so it--in the final analysis you--you'd shoot the marbles--and from this big circle and how many get out and at the end you counted how many you have, well the people who were really good knew how to get in there and do it and I would sort of wait around until I see the marbles lined up in some sort of way and then for my turn I'd get up out from--someone else had done all the work and so on, but I--I tend to be strategically oriented in my thinking.  I was probably a more strategic marble shooter than I was there but I--I played marbles and it was kind of a neighborhood in which you--you the games and things that you played were those that didn't require instruments.  There was no swimming pool there or anything like that, things--things that required resources, but it was very easy if you could get a bat and a ball--anything that could be done with a ball or to be kicked or didn't require uniforms or--or things like that.  Those were the things that--that we did and so marbles was very easy because any place you could find an area and you'd cut it out and we could do that.  There was trees in the back part of the yard.  I remember cherry trees and we would climb the cherry trees and you learned to make these pea shooters and things.  So even though it was an urban life, you had--from which individuals had come, it also had kind of some other kind of--in today's world but not then sort of a little suburban conclave so we were sort of enclaves in the middle of big things.
Story_ID: 11439
Speaker 1: During the elementary school years, during that time in your life, did you have dreams and aspirations, like did you think about what you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I think that every time I saw something, heard something, considered something that I thought was significant--it's probably what I wanted to do and to become, and--and part of which I was--I was reading I would--I think because of my religious underpinning, people--and the fact that I had you know, ministered, it never crossed my--that was not something that I would ever--ever thought about, but I--I did always as I started gravitating--the thing that perhaps interested me the most was to become a lawyer, and the reason for that is the lawyer--you--you have to consider my concept of a lawyer.  The lawyer was a person who had great knowledge, who could defend others and abdicate on behalf of others.  It was always the courtroom drama that was going to be significant to--where you could do those things and also it was something that--it seemed to me the more I--I read about it--it probably was to be a lawyer.

Speaker 1: What about did your dad every show you like carpentry skills and that kind of thing?  Were you interested in that?
Speaker 2: No, I was not interested.  In fact I have to explain about my father.  My father was very interested in carpentry, but I remember at the time that the was there, the classification if you were an African American was not to be a carpenter.  You were to be the carpenter's assistant, and although he did all the work that's kind of what he did and--but he--he is--he was one of those individuals that was very handy and in fact, even today I am comparatively so, not as good as some, but I am interested, but he would--would--we would do things, so if it came time to do something--I remember with my father, we built a skateboard together.  He, you know, he got the wood but I would all the things and kind of--you gotta skate and you sort of run around.  If something needed to be repaired at--he was very good at helping.  I was the helper and--but I was not a very good helper because I tended to do it and follow through and he was always supportive.  I was not the kind of--of a child who would wait to be told so if something was there I would actually start it and then say, look I started this and kind of help him, but I--he was--he worked very hard.
Story_ID: 11441
Speaker 1: The memory of my father was such that in discipline to the best of my knowledge I don't think I've ever remembered my father inflicting any kind of carnal punishment.  Mother would use that little switch or something, it certainly could happen, but you what didn't--but he was one of those ones who would sit down and have that little talk and I remember I would prefer that little switch or the other set of things in here but he was--he always would--was a very reasoned person.  My mother was the more extroverted one in here and she absolutely worshiped him and he--but he was the in--in that particular period in here, although in today's standards he was the kind of head of the household, and--although at that time it didn't seem like that way because she clearly deferred to him in those kind of matters--not something that happens in my household.

Speaker 1: What was the name of the church that you all attended growing up?
Speaker 2: There were two.  One was a church in North Carolina and--that we would go back even though we lived there we would go back, and I might add even though I was born there I didn't really live there because it was--someone asked where you were born in Roper and then I--I think I was only there for just a very, very short time, and--(those pregnancies that?) happen in that way.  My older sisters were born in Norfolk and they'd come back, but any--anyway what--what I remembered  most--I'm sorry I--I--.
Speaker 1: The name of the Church.
Speaker 2: The--the church was called, it was called I believe Bethel--Bethel Church.  It was--it was a denomination called "Disciples of Christ"--Disciples and it is today a variant of the Christian Church now--comparatively small and the same thing was in the--the Norfolk area, and I--but I--the way in which we--we came along my mother had been Baptist and so we--we--and First Baptist Church at the time and so we--we did--went to--to both of them there but it was--it was always perceived by my father that this church is where you need to have your center.  So when it was time to be baptized you'd have to go back to North Carolina and the baptism didn't take place and so you actually went into the--the Albemarle Sound and they would have this whole thing and actually go out into the water because that's the way in which John the Baptist did it and so you actually were dipped in that and so--but in those church--in both of those church environments in--but the Baptist Church and on my mother's side we would--we would go back and forth to all of them and church was something we did every Sunday.  It was not something that you--you never thought about, it was just one or the other.
Story_ID: 11443
Speaker 1: And was it all day?  Did you go to Sunday School then go to church and then go to activities after church?
Speaker 2: No, no not really but it depends upon where it was.  When I was visiting with my family in North Carolina, they had--it--it was--because people came from long distances, relatively long distances in order to get there and I remember beside this church there was this kind of platform and they had these long--these planks of wood and you'd go to church and then after church you would--they'd would put some cloth covering over them and they became tables and everyone bought their own baskets and things.  Now you have to remember (now?) they came to this church at this time.  This is in the--in the '40's [1940s] (that year?).  People came in carts drawn by horses and a few individuals would have--I think their, your know, automobile but that was kind of my--I remember my uncles and so on at this time had a--they were sort of--oh okay--upscale to do it but many people would come up and--and drive the--the horses and they would leave them all out there and--and people would put their food on the table and you got these little plates and I always remember my grandmother imbued in all of us whenever we visited, "You are only to eat the food that I bring here."  You're not suppose to it in any other place and--and my--and when we would go there to visit and--or even at other times my mother would do this, and I've often thought about this and you've just re-freshened me there now, but I--I tend to--if you would have a big pot lunch and so on, although I am never--I'm probably the one who is least likely to go around because of this because it would always--I  always wondered, but that--it was so--it was a period in which this was a way in which people came together and it did go on for long periods, but and--you would go for the others.  There was right by the church you'd walk through this cornfield, there was a graveyard over there for which everybody was buried and so people came to this community and I would dare say that, with the exception of someone like my father who got away, they--they came there, they lived there, they died there and--and everything was centered around of all of that, but--but the church was for many of them the central part of their lives.  Not because necessarily that they were religious, as much as it is it was the center of the activities of their lives.

Speaker 1: What about junior high school?  Did you actually attend a junior high school or did your elementary school go through a--?
Speaker 2: I went to junior high school.  I went to Jacox Junior High School.
Speaker 1: J period?
Speaker 2: J-A-C-O-X.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And what was interesting about this is that this the first time that I went to a school in which I had to catch a bus, and the reason for that is--remember the schools were segregated and so as a result, although there was a junior high school that was closer, I was assigned to--there were--at the time in this city I think about four--three or four junior high schools and I was assigned to the Jacox.  It was--it was one of the newer ones.  It was a--again, the same sort of thing that happened in there in which for the first time we were inter-reacting with students from--from all other parts of the city and they were sort of all--all brought in together and what I remember most about this high school is that it was sort of a continuance of what happened in--in junior high school.  I--it was the firs time--.
Speaker 1: It was elementary school.
Speaker 2: I mean elementary school.  It was the first time I had an exposure to the band.  So I had to learn a musical instrument and they wanted--I wanted to--to learn one and they assigned me the flute and I thought that I would get headaches once I try to--I want my--I wanted something that was louder and so finally I went to the bandmaster and he says, well the flute's very difficult and his rational--look you are very bright, you could learn how to do this, but I want to do something else and so I ended up with the trombone and I learned--that's where I learned to play the trombone.  In fact I played the trombone in high school and college and it's very accomplished--college, this trombone is but--there but I--but the same things have sort of happened in elementary school continued there.  I was--I tended to be a class leader.  I was a good student.  I was involved in a number of things, in fact I always remember one weak election I had is--I had left, gone into the navy and there'd been some articles and I went back to give a--a graduation talk at my junior high school in Norfolk.  My first graduation talk, but it was--what I remember most about that, is that junior high school in those days was considered more than just a preparatory nature for high school, it was that the high school wasn't big enough to accommodate and you had to have them all in there and--again from an education process I was very involved in activities and you name it and I sort of was in there, but I did some other sort of things which is I--even though I had to come a long way and ride the bus I'd get in there earlier, I was a school patrolmen and I remember I use to walk with this particular person at the end and I was one of those individuals if it's--if you're gonna have something, it was gonna be big and so I got to--we would do some innovative things in there and we had a radio program about what we did for the school programs.  I was very interested at the time, only because something would come up and I would represent my school.  We had something called the--as I recall--the traffic safety and the--they were trying to put some things together for traffic safety and I got involved in--in traffic safety and so we did T.V. programs and we'd have to go down once a month to the city--a place I had not been around--city hall and the person who was in charge of it was the president of the National--of the Travel--Virginia Trans--Transportation, whatever it was called at that particular time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 2: Was the owner of a car dealership and what I found fascinating is I would come there and we would--my school would always win because we would do things and make these great presentations for us--it was there, but this was the first time we got to do things in an integrated environment, in which our school versus others and so you sort of take on a little added importance in here, and I remember it was called "Kleins."  It was Irvine B. Klein.  How do I remember that and he was--and he--I remember one day he came to me and at the end and he said, "You know, you really have been very good.  I had, I don't know what year in junior high school, I guess about twelve or thirteen--.
Speaker 1: Eleven to thirteen,
Speaker 2: But he said to me at the time--my-my goals had changed and by this time I had decided that what I really wanted to be was a librarian because I remember reading about Huck and Tom and I mean whatever the--the--thinking of the moment why I like books and so on--what--it be great to be around a place, although it was so atypical given everything about me how that would be and so he asked me at the time, he says, what do you--what do you want to do and I said, I think I'd be a librarian.  He said why would you want to be a librarian?  I said, well, I--I'd like to be around schools.  I'd like to be around books and I said maybe one day I could even write and he felt that that was difficult and he says, oh, "Well you are one of the brightest young men that I've ever seen and you really don't want to do this," and he says "I really would like to take you under my wing, and he says the first thing that I would like to do is--you could come and work with me," and he said on time, and he was being very nice and was--I--he was just a car dealer person in here but he said--but the one thing I always remember, he says, would you be willing to go to a class, and I said "a class?"--he says because I want to get you some special language training to which I replied--I'd never been hesitant, what's wrong with--he says, "Well the way you talk you really--I think that it would be much more helpful to help you with some of the"--and he didn't say it in those words but intonation of the words and so on and I--as an example, and he says because you--it has kind of a--a Negroid sound and I couldn't decide at the time whether I was insulted or not, but you also had--and I always remember distinctly this conversation of someone who is really trying to be helpful, who wanted to do some things for me and I said what's wrong with having a Negroid sound, and I--and everybody--.
Story_ID: 11445
Speaker 1: And so let's just pick up that story a little bit--and when you--what was his response when you asked what's wrong with the negroid sound?
Speaker 2: I think that first of all my--the counselor/teachers that were with me were almost apoplexic and I think that he was trying to--he said I think that--he tried to recover and said that you are--I think that you are a very special young man and I think that being able to do that would make it easier for you to do some things, and he also indicated that, you know being a librarian, and you know--the point that he looked it was that you're--you're much too bright and this could be a great opportunity and he talked about things in terms of aspirations that I'd never thought about--then he--and so I thought it was all over but he asked me if I would come over to his office and I'll always remember this.  I went over there, this was in junior high school and I went over to his--this big dealership, the name was Tom Klein--Irvine Klein Chevrolet or whatever it is--it's huge around there and still--still exists and I went into this office larger than anything that I've ever seen, but before going there I was waiting and told him who it was and everybody was about ready to--what is this kid doing around here?  You wanna throw me away.  "No, I--I'm here to see him," and--and they called in this very elderly black man who came over and he says, "What do you want," and I told him why I was there and he could barely believe the story. And--and so he was kind of saying you really shouldn't do this and--and in the middle of that he walked out, and he walked over and I remember saying, "How are you," and I said, "Are you Mr. Klein?" And he turned to this person and said, "This is my boy.  The guy said, "Well you gotta a fine poppa," and he says "And this is a good boy too," and--and when he--and I don't know how old I was and I remember saying--and he was-- actually if I think about the tenor of the times, he was probably being as conciliatory and as helpful as he could be and I actually had enormous and still think about this with the normal respect but he was a--he was a part of his time and I happen to be a part of the time in which I would question almost everything.  Perhaps I never--perhaps at that time with a degree of irreverence but not so much in today, but one of the things that he did that I will always recall, is that he got me to think about that there is another world outside of the one in which I am and seeing the dealership and owning all of this I'd never been--seen or associated with anything that was even a part of wealth and I thought, my gosh, you know this is--is pretty good and I--he--and one--I never did go to those classes.  I never did go over to do all those things, but I did stay a little bit in touch with him, not--not that much because he was some part of a discomfort, but one of the things that I would see him or he would talk about and that is, this whole notion of just don't settle for what you have seen around you.  There's something bigger and better than that and so from him I must admit that--that was as instructive as other kind of things that I've gotten, but anyway at that junior high school, Jacox Junior High School, I was a good student.  I was very involved in activities.  I was, I think the one thing that I remember that probably made the big difference is I was somewhat, not theatrical in the classical sense of theatrical, but theatrical in the sense that I--there was--I was never uncomfortable with an audience or anything of that particular nature so, if there was something special that needed to be done I tended to always be involved.  I--I and I was able to in most cases excel comparatively easily, but I had--I was always very involved with people.  I enjoyed being around people and so and if there was an extracurricular activity around generally I was a part of most of them and--and most likely with a leadership role.
Speaker 1: You said that the relationship with Mr. Klein--didn't--you didn't continue it because there was a certain level of discomfort.  What did you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Well, discomfort in the point that I--I think that I've always been a relatively self--I'm not certain self-assured is as much as it is--I can't think of the--the best word to use, I--I but the concept is that my--I talked about the pride that I got in there--I always felt that--that I was able to compete and do things until someone would prove something to me differently, and this is the first time I think for me which was actually very good that someone--because I was perceived to be one who could speak comparatively well and had decent oratory skills and--and the notion that--that there was something wrong with my intonation or the way in which I said thing or--a negroid kind of sound, it was representative of what everything and so I--I thought about that.  The fact that at the time when I remembered telling him about this--this new aspiration of the time to be a--a librarian and particularly within the school environment because that's what I wanted, that that really wasn't enough.  I think in all of it in here, it was both challenging but it was a different kind of a world, but there was--it was--it was a--a person who could have been and if I had availed myself of it, probably an extraordinary role model, but for me it was someone who was reaching down to help me and I read into this that I--the helping was because there was something deficient about me as opposed to taking the skills and abilities that I have and helping to elevate them to a higher level, and I think that it was that even though my--I remember my teachers, the counselors and all the others around them who felt that I was the luckiest person--could not quite understand why I wouldn't immediately jump into that almost in a patron-type form.  So, but--but with hindsight and given the tenor of the times, he was Irvine B. Klein, now that I remember his name and I had not thought about it for a long time, probably did something that almost no one of his generation at the time was willing to do.
Story_ID: 11446
Speaker 1: Who was influencing you at this particular time in your life during the junior high school years?  Who were you being most influenced by?
Speaker 2: I think that I tended to be influenced by those who were successful in whatever it is that they did and not particular individuals.  If there was a sports figure--this is the day you have to remember that Jackie Robinson or of a Joe Louis, and--and the reason why they were so important, and I remember when Joe Louis use to fight-- (unclear) were (unclear) almost everywhere and any African American community world, everybody listened to it on the radio and there was this cheering afterwards about if he'd won, or watching I knew about baseball because of Jackie Robinson.  I--I knew every game he played and then every opportunity that I listened to so, but they were good.  They were people who excelled in what they did.  I was fascinated by this man I remember who played the piano--the typewriter.  I believe his name was Cortez Peters.  I hope that's right, and--but he played to music and he would type--he typed to music and he had these little sounds and everything and there was actually later on a--a some kind of a administrative or secretarial business grew named after him, but--.
Speaker 1: And he typed to music?
Speaker 2: He--he typed so fast and so I thought that was fascinating because he could do that.  Anybody--people--I--I tended to be taken by those for whatever it was that they could do it very--very, very well and it was the whole concept of I--I didn't impress--put it in those language, but I have a very high regard for--for excellence and being able to--to see those.  So I tend to be motivated.  So I--I--no one ever pushed me harder than I was willing to push myself because I would never be satisfied to be anything less than what I considered some degree of excellence, but the thing that is interesting about it is I don't think that it's anything I ever did consciously.  I was--I had friends and almost everything that they did I was out there kind of with them and we were doing the same thing and--but I would then come back and if I had a homework assignment, I'd get it done and I would find those moments and to be able to balance all of it, but I was--if you--to answer your question specifically, I am not certain if there were individual models, but if you were to put them all to--there's probably a composite of those individuals and if there was any way to describe them collectively, it would be those who were successful in doing the things that they did.
Story_ID: 11447
Speaker 1: What was the name of the high school you attended?
Speaker 2: It has now been changed.  It was called Booker T. Washington High School.  We called it "Booker T."  They now call it "Washington High School," I now found out (unclear), but that's in Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in high school?  Do you remember the names of some of your high school teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think that in--this was a period of great change in our country.  It was a time in which there was--there was still a segregated environment and--and what I perhaps remember the most is that the-- there were the teachers who sort of gravitated towards those who they thought they had some opportunity to perhaps go to college and to do some things.  I was, as I indicated, I played sports.  I played in the band.  I was--in the high school fraternity I was the president of the fraternity.  I was on the honor society.  You just name them--that--there was probably was not where--I--academically I was--okay. I graduated second in my class.  It was a huge high school.  I was president of the student government and--but one of the things that I remembered the most is that there was this science teacher and he really was interested in getting individuals to think about college and he was willing with his own time, money to take a (unclear) afterwards and do things and particularly to get them interested in the sciences, because you have to remember in the late--in the mid 1950's the whole notion of science was taking on all kinds of proportion.  He probably at the time was as responsible as anyone that I know for getting the young people into various colleges and he did something very interesting about it, and that is he primarily tried to push the students in terms of their SATs and getting out because he wanted them--remember this was the day immediately after the Supreme Court decision in 1954, and colleges and universities around were (enuschaed?) (ph.) if for no other reason that what was happening here of integrating their--their schools, and so he was really kind of pushing them to go to these newly integrated schools or schools that were about to be integrated, but again, I remember that I remembered--.
Speaker 1: What was his name?  Do you remember his name Mr. Norman?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm gonna tell you in a moment--so in fact as I was talking the--the part of my brain was trying to remember how I could ever forget his name.  I can see him.  I'm right here now and I'm going to think about it in a moment.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: But I do--I remember the principals.  I remember the principals from junior high school and all the others because these were people I--I was a good enough student that I could stand out--at least in there, both in terms of my extracurricular activities and some of the academic things.  But what I remember most about the teachers is that if a person had gone to college and had gotten a masters in biology, the opportunity to work in a industry--to work in a laboratory--to work for a pharmaceutical firm as a biologist was practically, no.  There were a few but they're not and so what they did, they turned to education and so at that time, this is not true today, but at that time what you would find is that when it was biology or mathematics or and so on.  I was a good math student I recall and I remember the math teacher who was probably in today's environment one of the most talented individuals that--that you'd find but she would put all of her time and--and would select a few students to be competitive and--and various kinds of things to represent the school etcetera in which I did a number of those and almost every teacher had an addition to his or her duties and responsibilities to the class.  There was some kind of extracurricular activities for which they serve as the monitor or so on and so what I remember is that it was actually for us easier than perhaps today because there was always there someone to try to help, to nurture, to want to help someone to succeed and they got their sense of satisfaction in--in seeing their students become something that for them better than what they found them to be when they first discovered and so I too remember very, very much that this was for me as productive environment as I could be over at the time--it didn't mean anything but looking back on it now it was--those of us were very fortunate to have the opportunity because in today's school environment, and I know this with my children, that's not as--although you find a tremendous quantity of dedication, I'm not certain you would find the same caliber of people, not because they're not as good, but because you had people who were there because they had to be and that was their alternative in life.
Speaker 1: When you were in high school what were some of your thoughts about college?  Did you think you were going to college?
Speaker 2: I always thought I would go to college.
Speaker 1: You did.
Speaker 2: Because college was a precursor for whatever it took to be successful, so it was not a question of ever having to be persuaded.  I didn't know where I was gonna go, not because I came from an environment neither of my parents went to college, but I had a sister who did go to college--.
Speaker 1: Where did your sister go to college?
Speaker 2: To Virginia State College.
Speaker 1: In Petersburg?
Speaker 2: In Petersburg--actually--actually she went that first two years at the Norfolk division of Virginia State College and then she went to the last two--that was kind of the way in which you were sort of expected to go.  That's where everybody went before there was--that was pre--Norfolk State College. That's another story.
Speaker 1: And this was your older sister?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah and now what--what was interesting about the school at that particular time is that in addition to the sports and the clubs and the activities and the young ladies and everything else that was there, it was--again it was the school in which you had to catch the bus to go over there in the morning.  There was little stores around and instead of the cafeteria you can go and eat around there.  It was not that far from where I went to junior high school in here.  It was the largest high school in the city.  There were a large, relatively large number of high schools in there in the city, but this was where the African Americans went in Norfolk, as there was a place where they went in Port Smith and a place where they went in Virginia Beach and son on, and--and so they--altogether you had an environment much larger because you interacted and played sports and did all the things together, so you knew the various community, but this was, if you lived in Norfolk, in the Norfolk area you went to Booker T, or went to Catholic School.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: 1956.
Story_ID: 11448
Speaker 1: Where did you decide to go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, it was an interesting situation.  I didn't really decide.  I gravitated to there and the reason for this I'll always remember.  I had been elected as student council president and they had this arrangement in which they would bring together through the city of the student council--presidents from the various high schools and so on so.  It was not a case of integration as that was there and there was a small group.  Everybody--there were about seven or eight and they would get points of views and so on, but I remember one young person from another school and--and it was like in--I think if I'm not mistaken, this is sort of like in--in your junior year and so on and--where are you going to go college?  You know I--you don't--don't--you get ready to go to college when you're fully in a scene, you start doing all the other sort of things and he had indicated to me and I can't remember all of the circumstances but I always remember he said to me, I'm gonna go to the Naval Academy, and I said, really?  And I said--and he was telling--but the way--he told me one thing about the Naval Academy that stuck out larger than anything else.  He said--said is it very expensive?  This is how much I knew.  Remember I was suppose to be one of the bright kids around.  He said, oh, it doesn't cost you anything to go to the Naval Academy.  It doesn't cost anything?  No.  You get selected and you go there, and I thought, that's for me, and I'll always remember this because this had a profound impact on my life I think.  I went down to this recruiter and you have to remember I've very good grades, oh, when I say very good grades I was an A minus student, but that--I think I told you I was--.
Speaker 1: That's still very good.
Speaker 2: When I finished I was valedictorian--the salutatorian  my class and I had all these activities and if you would think about it from the point of view of the Navy, I was one of those things that kind of fit the mode.  I went down to the recruiting office and I said, I really am interested in going to the Naval Academy and I remember they--and he explained, well it's very difficult.  He went through all the (unclear), this was about 1954 or '55 [1955] somewhere around up in there, and one of the things that he asked me to do is to take this test, and I said I'll take it right now.  I took the test and took it comparatively quickly and gave it to him and he says, you finished, already?  He said you have more time.  I said, well I'm finished.  So he took it.  I don't know to this day what my score was, but I think I did quite well, because he said to me, look we can take you and you really can do well, but he says, you--you really don't want to go to the Naval Academy.  He says and I want to be honest with you.  He said, we don't take colored people at the Naval Academy, but we can, what I can do is get you into this and you can do this and he was telling me about all the duties and responsibilities that I can have and I'll always remember because what he said--one of the things he described to me was a steward.  I don't know if you know what a steward is in the Navy, but it is the one who serves the food and does all the other things.  I want to tell you the reason why that's important, and I was very really irate, but anyway, but it had a very lasting impression.  I want to tell you about my Navy career, you'll understand (what had a Naval impression?), but anyway going back to--to that I started looking around and--and because I had a sister in college and there really wasn't any money in there I had to do what myself and so I--the way in which I went to college was almost different than anyone else.  I started applying to the person that he was helping me and all the others that teachers and things were doing, and my final decision was gonna be based on what was the smallest delta between the cost of the school and all the scholarships and grants and aids and everything that I was receiving and wherever there was the smallest delta, that's which one I was gonna go and I didn't visit any school.  I didn't do anything and I had finally decided on a school--Virginia at the time it was called Virginia Polytechnic Institute mainly because of my grades and all the others that wanted to go to school except, I remember very distinctly that I couldn't live in the dormitory.  I'd have to live outside the dormitory which I was a little--I didn't take that very well.
Speaker 1: So you'd have to live in the town that blacks were in?
Speaker 2: Live in the town that blacks were in and so on and so, but they were offering so much and you'd get all the things from Virginia that I was about ready to go until there was a group called the "National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students".  My gosh--I (unclear), it's remarkable that I can remember that now, and--and they were looking for students who--had--that to go to the schools to the schools that wanted to integrate.  I remember the time 1955 -'56 [1956], and so the thing that was remarkable is that I was contacted by a dean of admission who got in touch with my--with me and my counselors and all the others about coming to this school.  Never heard of it, never knew anything about it but I was already accepted and was going through to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and this was at the last moment.  They got my name through this and the National--this--this National Scholarship Fund it is what I was telling you about, and others were willing to give you extra and help make up the delta in your--if you were to go to one of these schools.  The school was West Virginia Weslyan College.  Never heard of it, knew nothing about it.  I didn't have a clue.  The only thing that I knew is if I would go there and they would give--they also had a job that I would have working in the dining room that would cover all of it.  Eureka, I found my college!  That's how I ended up at the last moment.  In fact for about the--it's always kind of interesting that I kept getting letters from VPI because they--it was a long time they would even--some letters to my mother about how I was doing there, you know, but that's how I ended up going to college.  Not the kind of sophisticated way in which it is done today.
Story_ID: 11449
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like at West Virginia Weslyan?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was the first time that I'd gone from an environment in which, although I had all kind of exposures and if I could tell you about my high schools and because I tended to be representative in all the others that--that I'd had all kind because I was always a representative in school to do this, but this is the first time I got on a train with a trunk, with my mother carefully helping me and my father and--and my first train ride to ride from there to--from Norfolk to Buchanan, West Virginia.  Now this is not the days of the internet and so when I go into the library and I had the things I knew enough about it and I remember I woke up that morning in something called Crafton (ph.), West Virginia and if I'd had the money I'd of gone back, but it was a very good--it's a school--it's an old school 19--built in 1890, liberal arts school, had been started by the Methodist Church, but what was interesting about this environment and the school is that it was very insular.  There were things that were very negative, such as there were interestingly three, four African American students all kind of coming in there together, including one who I was just talking to yesterday--we called him a foreign student, but it was John Swan (ph.) whose now Premiere (ph.), in Premiere, Bermuda, but we all went to this school.  There were little things like getting a haircut.  The barber couldn't cut your hair so you had to do that, but--but we were fairly well integrated because I think one, we were sort of specially selected.  We had good grades.  We had--were tended to be kind of well rounded athletic students and involved in activities.  I was selected to join a fraternity for which they were just ready to be thrown out the nationals for accepting me and I--.
Speaker 1: Did you join?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What fraternity?
Speaker 2: Kappa Sigma Kappa Fraternity and in fact I became one of the leaders of that fraternity and the--but it was the--it was kind of an oasis in the middle of all of West Virginia so it was comparatively insulated but I had played sports.  I was a decent student.  I was involved in all kind of things.  There was a dicey social life in that as--sort of the black males and here you were very careful about doing it but there was--it was also a time in which you--there was certain kinds of attractions because it was the--almost forbidden, so it was--we had--it worked out alright.  I--I think that in time--in a--.
Speaker 1: So there was interracial dating?
Speaker 2: The--the--there was not formal interracial dating.  We would go to things together.  You would do some things, but it was--it was very carefully done, but remember I was in a fraternity and we had sororities and we interacted so there was large quantities of--but it was more group interactions than--than singular interactions and--and it worked out comparatively well.  I happen to be on the Board of Trustees at the school that day, but that was my college life.
Story_ID: 11450
Speaker 1: What did you think you wanted to do as a career, when you went to college cause you got your degree in chemistry and math?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was the time of the glorification of the sciences in which we were really worried about the--as a nation, how well everyone else was doing and I had scored very relatively highly in upper percentiles in terms of math and science and so on and so.  That's where the attraction was.
Speaker 1: So were you thinking you wanted to teach?  What were you thinking you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: I--I think that in the back of my mind I'd often thought about I told you being a lawyer, but in this particular case I really didn't think about it.  It was that math and sciences was what was being described as the upper tier of where the better students and so on wanted to go.  I didn't really picture myself in a laboratory.  I didn't picture myself in terms of--I pictured myself in terms of studying and being good and the acquisition of knowledge and information but I didn't picture myself in terms of what the net product was going to be next, to be perfectly frank with you.
Story_ID: 11451
Speaker 1: Mr. Norman when you graduated with your degree in chemistry and math what were you thinking you were gonna do professionally?
Speaker 2: I thought what am I gonna do and so I decided that the obvious thing is to go to graduate school and to get a doctorate in chemistry and so I applied to various schools and decided on the University of Wisconsin  I had--actually there's two schools that I was perhaps--as I can recall, one was the University of Oklahoma in Norman.  I was sort of attracted by the name in there but when I applied--the one thing that they did they--they told me that had found for me--now this is in 1960 that they--their dormitories at the time were not integrated and that they were gonna find a place for me and all the others--this is graduate school--and all the others.  Well I was--I was sort of taken by that and not and (not there?)--there--there are a number of things.  I hope that I am not a vindictive person but there are things that I do remember that had a profound impact that--that perhaps in all fairness I--I did take it negatively.  I--I'll give you a good example.  One of my fraternity brothers had--had this job in which they was selling encyclopedias during the break and--and this encyclopedia company--so when I came home I applied to them and I told them where I was and they were, oh, come down.  They were all excited until I arrived and when I arrived they were mortified and they said, oh, we did not know and you--you can't really do this and they went on to explain and they were trying to be nice, but it was the most awkward moment for everyone. And I said, "Are you telling me that I'm not able to have--to have this job in here even though all my fraternity brothers and so on are doing this, just because I'm black?" And of course they would never say that--they said well we--"We can't do this because you can't go this neighborhood," and all of that and--and I said, "Well they sell them almost everywhere,"--and I was really there, but I left and I always remember going back to libraries and if I see theirs I say, we shouldn't buy those things--those encyclopedias and I--I won't name the name but I--they--they lost business because of me (laughter) and, but I use that as an example but there were a lot of things.  There was this company that I--I told you that when I first went to college they had--I worked in the dining room as a waiter and I was a very good waiter and whatever else they did but at the end they had these leadership positions.  The supervisors and, but the really crème de le crème job was the headwaiter in here cause they got to do all the assignments and didn't have to wait or anything, and so I really was one of the best among them and I remember this particular company he said, "Look are you going to come back next year?", and I said "Yes, I want to be the headwaiter," and he said, "look we can't do this," and he went through all the other reasons why he could not and he says, "But what we can do,"--and I needed the money by the way cause this is all part of everything,
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --"But what we can do is we have this crew in the--that washes the dishes and you could be the--the one who cleans the dishes and put them in there," and I was really upset about that and I ended up being able to make it on, 'cause I didn't work there and--and that company to this day knows who they are because I have made a big deal about what they did and look your--your opportunities that were lost. But--but I was never bitter but I always learned in here that I never was one who easily would be put into a position in which--if I was gonna be denied something for my race, I was not one of those individuals--but--but I had my ways that I always felt I could be very impact-ful--that you would rue the day that would occur, but having--that' not what your question was?
Speaker 1: Graduate school?
Speaker 2: Graduate school was--was a disaster.  I went there and when to the town I--.
Speaker 1: University of Wisconsin?
Speaker 2: University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin and I stayed temporarily at the--as I was getting there--at the YMCA at the University YMCA and I was looking around and trying to find a place in Madison to stay and it was tough.  I went down the list and--and they were not oriented to--and so finally I talked to someone in--in this University YMCA and--and they had already had it booked up but I was able to persuade them that I could be helpful and so I got a room there at the University YMCA.  Actually--and I studied chemistry--organic chemistry and I realized something.  There I became at last elevated enough in my thinking that, hold it.  This isn't something that is an academic pursuit  You gotta work in there and--you--and the whole thought of working in a chemistry laboratory, I don't care how you do it was not something that was motivating to me and--but I was so far along in there and a wonderful thing happened.  At the University they had--they had this program--I remember the timing in 1960 and it was after the--in which there was a thaw out between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R  and the YWCA--YMCA--YWCA was part of this program of an exchange--a cultural exchange program in the Soviet Union.  I remember 1960, '61 [1961].  This is really a deal and this group there wanted to sponsor me for this program and as luck would have it or fate would have it or whatever it is, I was selected as the--as one of the students to go on this cultural exchange program in the Soviet Union.  It happened wonderfully because it--had that not occurred perhaps today, just through the forces of nature and everything that has happened, I could have ended up working in some laboratory and maybe I might have been successful, maybe not, but it would not have been something that pleased me, and I--so at the end of this year I went on this exchange program in the Soviet Union  Now there were two things that happened in here rather significantly when I was in college.  At the end of the time, because we--we realized some fraternity brothers and I--we took this test for the Navy Officer School and I was not really interested but we did well and the idea was those who passed got to go on a flight and they would fly you to Washington, D.C. to do some other things and all and come back.  I thought, that had to be great.  So, we wanted to pass this so that you'd get that--everybody would tell you about this flight and have this great weekend and all the other things you could do and I did--signed all the papers and all that but I was--the last thing I was interested in was going into the Navy and so they were willing to--to offer me an opportunity to come in the aviation--I mean to the Officer Candidate Program and I said no.  I'm in school and I don't really want to do that.  Hold that for a moment.  So when I went on this exchange program it was perhaps for me one of the more interesting moments in my life primarily because I remember sailing over with this group--the State Department and all was trying to brief us and making certain that we were well prepared for this.  We first went into Budapest.  We were the first American groups that had gone there since the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.
Speaker 1: How many blacks were in the group?
Speaker 2: How many blacks were in the group?  We were divided into two--we--big groups but it was divided and I--there was one black in one group and one in the other and--and all in all there were about close to twenty of us--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In here so.  I--I can remember like one in one group of ten and I--I ended up having to be student leader of that group, but it was kind of a self-selection.  We--I remember going into Budapest and there was a entirely different culture.  A lot of--well, remember I'd never been outside of the United States and it was kind of interesting because it's the first I really had a very difficult time because it turned out that I needed a passport and lo and behold I didn't have a--a birth certificate that we could find and we had to go and get a delayed certificate of birth because I was delivered by a midwife who never put it in there and I've learned something about this here now but anyway I was--this was all done in Budapest and--and it was fascinating because there, there was a feeling that the people in Hungary were really unhappy because when they Hungarian Revolution was taking place they always were under the impression that the U.S. was gonna support them and they did not.  There were still the bullet holes in the streets and things like that and but I found out something at the time.  We were all talking about techniques of how to get individuals to talk to us and how--how--how to interact and for me it was not only very easy, but everyone--they wanted to get a closer look and learn and things that and even in the Soviet Union, I remember the first time I was in Gorky Park and all you had to stop and crowds would come around to get a closer look, and--and I was asked a question by someone who always very--they could not be more congenial and--but they asked me this question.  He says, "Why is it--"he answered the question he was about to--"why is it that your hands are black and white", and I--I couldn't understand it until I realized that they were looking at the part in here and were--and--and I started doing some thinking and some reflection about myself, but--but it was a time of greater--because I had no privacy.  I had a group that at one time I got pulled away because--by a group of individuals who tried to get me to defect, primarily because their--their perception in--in making this thing to me was that every African American was being lynched in the streets. I mean it was the caricature of almost everything, but it was a period for me of seeing the world through a prison that I had never seen before.  It was at that time that I was entirely reinforced that--that I was not going to be into chemistry.  I'd became interested in history and so much about the world and I--I told you I'd always read a great deal and that was a very defining moment for me because at that particular moment I knew that--that the life of being a scientist was not fathomed, that it was going to be something much differently and so when I came back from--from that trip, I did something because I was not going--it was too late to return to--to graduate school at the time, but I wouldn't have gone back anyway and I actually taught high school in Norfolk, Virginia.
Story_ID: 11452
Speaker 1: You were a math teacher, right?
Speaker 2: A math teacher because the schools had already started and they needed a math teacher, and one of my contemporaries that I knew well and interestingly, my math teacher who had been there knew that I was there and I had never had any training and all that, but there for math and of course I--I it worked out so very well, but I had only been there for about a month or two when I got one of those letter that you no longer get today [ref. to a draft letter].  It said greetings from the President of the United States, and I knew that something had to be better than going into the Army, so I remembered that I had taken these tests for the Navy and I actually went down there and got it quickly activated and decided to do it and went in to the Aviation Officer Candidate Program, and that's how I ended up going into the Navy.  Now, if you'd bear in mind some of the things--something that I said to you earlier about my very first experience--remember this is Norfolk and this is a naval town.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--and so it is not that the Navy has the (unclear) I mentioned there because you remember all the other things about it, but--but I remember it was really very interesting to be--to go into the Navy--a Navy that didn't want to have any--at the time to do this and--and perhaps the most coming full circle within that is when I taught at the Naval Academy.  The school that wouldn't want to take me at that particular time.
Speaker 1: What year did you teach at the Naval Academy?
Speaker 2: I taught at the Naval Academy in 1960 around 1965, '66 [1966], or '67 [1967].  Actually, my apologies.  It started, I think in 1967.
Story_ID: 11453
Speaker 1: What you were your experiences like in the Navy?
Speaker 2: I was--because as a Naval officer it was entirely different from anything--the military prided itself on being ahead of the rest of the society at large.
Speaker 1: Mr. Norman let me ask you something.  I'm sorry, were--were you well received as an African American Naval officer, or was it met with some resistance?
Speaker 2: I think that you have to understand part of the environment.  How I was received was a consequence of what it was.  I was bright, relatively bright.  I could compete with anyone that was going on, so that was not the problem.  When I went to Aviation Officer's Candidate School, they--there were merit based things. I could play music.  I was a, a good athlete.  I was--I could make good grades in school--I was kind of the top of my class and so you get the officer position as aviation officer candidate by virtue of--of what it is and its--and--and in that particular case it was not a lot of subjectivity with it--  some of it, and I had all the experiences that you would have.  I was in--they wanted to know who could play band.  You would get assigned there?, and I was in the band, but the band had to go to New Orleans to play and the bandmaster said I was the only African American in my--my group there and that to--they had an experience once before and people threw things and so on and he told me I couldn't go to New Orleans.  I was really very unhappy for a different reason.  I wanted to go to New Orleans and--and we had a real discussion about this and of course his argument is that he was being very protective.  I had experiences in which--in flight schools--just to tell you about it in which I had been--I was asked not to come to the officer club, because that particular night they were having some people there--even though I was already commissioned.  So, it was a mixed feeling.  I think that on the one hand, I was accepted well by the people who were around me because they--they knew that I was--was very good and I--I was a relatively self-assured individual.  I was not going tolerate a lot of foolishness.  There is some--so many things that happened that this--the Navy had a large quantity of institutional racism and all--almost in any way in which you want to describe it and it was the kind of--in fact if I may and you ask this question, I'll tell you this part about my life and that you may want it--to know about this.  I took the composites of what happened in here and I could tell you story after story after story of--of what happened.  One, I saw very well in terms of what he was doing, but the kind of experiences that I had were always limiting but which I was able to overcome at UBI Carrier--an aircraft carrier with three to four thousand people and I could be the only black or one of just a few on the entire ship.  There was a time in which virtually I could tell you the name of every African American Naval Officer that was in there.  This was the time in this--that's going on, but something happened if I may jump ahead.  Is it alright?
Speaker 1: Yes, that's fine.
Speaker 2: To tell you I--I remember you talk about the Naval Academy.  When I was--I'd gotten a--a master's degree in the Navy.  I'd been selected for this program.
Speaker 1: What year did you get your master's degree?
Speaker 2: 1967 from the American University because they wanted--because of my background and all the others they wanted to have this special experience in international relations and that's how I ended up going to the Naval Academy, and when I arrived at the Naval Academy-naval officer--young, single, I wanted to get an apartment in town. And I went to my very first apartment that advertised the Navy had and I went over and--and they told me that unfortunately this was Annapolis, Maryland, that they were not, unfortunately they were not--they were not taking blacks in there at that time and I saw--I remember gong back and I--I went to another place and got the same answer.  I then went back and said I can't check in.  I was staying the BOQ [Bachelor Officers Quarters] getting this done and so they said to, oh, not to worry.  We'll make certain that we'd find a place for--you know you have a room here, you're place in the BOQ.  I didn't want to live in the BOQ.  So I went over to see the Admiral, and I insisted that I needed to see him and I'll kind of always remember this and talking to the chief of staff and I won't call his name and I explained the situation to him and I confided and either they--that a place would be opened to me or that we ought to make it off limits to all military personnel--they had a large quantity over there and I was insistent and I said I'm refusing to report if this is not going to occur and--cause I'm not going to have to live like this.  Now I had been involved all the time in a lot of things in terms of trying to improve conditions in the Navy and--but I knew where my grounds were and I knew what was going on and I went back to Washington because I knew this person, Colonel Martin who was in the Office of Equal Opportunity at the time and I went on to explain it go him and he sort of gave me some encouragement.  The net result of all the story is that it caused a big buzz but they agreed that they would--and the Admiral who I--who could not have been more supportive--with a little help from everyone around, decided that either would accept me or that they would--that it would be declared off limits to other military personnel.  That resulted--as a I got an apartment there, but this was a case of kind of all the things that's going around here, but bringing about I can put it all into form by telling you one story if I may.  I was in the Navy.  I'd done very well. I'd been promoted early and I was in with a squadron of--I'm sorry--making tours out in Vietnam I'd flow missions and over there and--and I was assigned to a carrier division.  This is the (unclear) and all of it and I actually as a young naval officer--as a new Lieutenant Commander was in the combat information center doing controlling of things that persons much more senior would be willing to do and I had lots of time because I was assigned the mid-watch--the from midnight to 6:00 a.m. to work and I had lots of time and I decided that I was--I was a regular naval officer and even though I'd had a good experience it was time to go and I decided to resign my commission.  I had a number of wonderful jobs at the time.  I'd been a White House Aide.  I'd been--at the Naval Academy I think as I indicated in here I had--.
Story_ID: 11454
Speaker 1: What administration were you a White House Aide?
Speaker 2: Under President Nixon and--I'm sorry under President [Lyndon] Johnson and then the first part of the Nixon administration, but what--what made all of this really significant is I had a chance after all things--I had been involved in a number of things about how to improve conditions for minorities in the military.  I'd done things that I'd been very open--and--and I mention in there, there is a book on watch that you might want to take a look at (unclear) because it depicts some of it but I wrote a letter because I was resigning but I didn't write an ordinary letter.  I decided to write one of those letters and put there that if I were the head of the Navy, here's what I would do to improve conditions for minorities in the Navy, well as fate would have it and this is really fate again, a new chief of Naval Operations, a head of all the naval services was coming into--into duty and he asked (unclear) Admiral (unclear). And he asked the question, "What are some of the new and creative things that we're doing in here?"  Without going through all the stories, somehow my letter ended up with the staff members and they had to do it and they reluctantly indicated that it as someone who had--was getting out of the Navy and we had just come back from a cruise and we were there and I'd--by the time I'd just gotten married and my wife was teaching at a--a school there and I was in--in the Navy and I got this call saying--from the Admiral on the Carrier Division Staff that you're going to get a call from the Chief of Naval Operations, well I had been--I worked at the Pentagon before and everybody is the chief of operations, but not that and I got this message that they wanted me to fly to Washington and to talk with him.  My gosh.  So I did--got on there and flew and when I came in to see him I was pre--prepped by everybody.  This is all about his really--about this letter and what do you want to do about it, but they told me I had fourteen minutes to meet with him.  Well, you gotta remember, I'm a lieutenant commander and there--there's--and--and at the Pentagon and around the Chief of Naval Operations, there were flag officers and everybody that you ever want to know with it and so I knew that I had it.  I thought I'm not gonna waste my time.  So I decided at that particular moment, if I'm gonna have my fourteen minutes, I'm not going to dilly dally around, I'm going to tell him what I think, and so I walked in there and we went to--and said Admiral they told me I only have fourteen minutes.  The Vice Chief of Naval Operations and all the other people were there and the whole notion that a lieutenant commander's going to be joining the staff where all the--could possibly do it and before he could ask me about anything they said--he said, "what I want to do is to talk to you about it and see if there is any possible interest in perhaps you doing something in here," and I said, "Admiral, if you were to do this, here's what I think--here's what I think to make the Navy the kind of place that it really ought to be." And I--and I said I would suggest A, B, C, D and I went down the list, but then I said, but, of course, Admiral--the Navy was never, in my judgment willing to move in this direction but it hoped that this would serve as some value to you and everyone else in case we ever decide to move this way, these are the things that I think should be done.  Now, it was extraordinary presumptuous, this is a lieutenant commander.  There are people with more seniority and so on but I was getting out of the Navy, I mean so what are they going to do?  Tell me to get out of the Navy, and--and I'll always remember this.  He looked at me and he said, you know it's very easy to come and to talk about all the things that need to be done.  He says, "but if you are willing to come and join my staff, as my assistant, we will implement those things," and I--and it is obvious I've got the world's worse face and so you can see the look on my face in disbelief that there is no way that this is going to occur and he said to me some really interesting words.  He said, commander, the conditions will be these.  You do not have to rescind your letter of resignation, but at any time that you feel that I'm not in the spirit of what we are talking about committing to make the kind of changes that you are talking about, then you can leave, and anytime you are not working to the level of what I expect of someone on my staff and I'm not looking to use it as (unclear) matter but as someone who can--then you can leave, and that' the conditions under which we worked for three years and it was--.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: This was 1970 to '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: 1970 to 1973.
Speaker 2: And it perhaps the most profound period of the U.S. Navy, more than--first of all everyone of the things that was on there not only was accomplished but more.  The Navy changed more in those three years in a way in which--never had and it was not because there was a man who had this great vision.  It was that you had a chief of naval operations who was sort of astounded by the Navy that he loved and so on who was very strategic that would have the kind of environment in which this would occur, and I would encourage you if you would read from him his words of how he met me and what happened in there.  I think that you will get a tone of what happened and how the Navy was able to go through this kind of change that it went through, but one of the most satisfying of all the things he did, I would work with him and we had these "Z-grams"? (ph.) and this is before your time, you would never (know?) of this, but one of the most satisfying things--I had this arrangement in which I made--part of the quid pro quo of me coming here is that I said, "Admiral, so that I won't have to have these fourteen minutes, that I would come over to your house and I'd have breakfast with you in the morning and we'd ride to work, and I'd drive my car over then we can go through these things."  Well that lead to--that of--there--to having breakfast with him to--what ended up until the day he died, a very close friendship, but one of the things I wrote down here and I'd do this and I'd have him to initial, "approve", "disapprove", or "let's discuss later".  I have to this day a list of probably one of the more valuable things that you can have of hundreds of suggestions and initiatives for which he's approved.  I never took those and went to anyone and said, the CNO's approved it.  But I knew that I had this in my hip pocket to get some things done.  But one of the--the--of all the recommendations, the one that I remember the most is a recommendation that I made that was probably one of the more contentious, but remember when I told you I originally went there and they talked about all the jobs I could have in the Navy and become a steward because that's where the minorities and so on went?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And at the time it had graduated from African Americans mostly to--to Filipinos and along with others and the recommendation was to stop the recruitment of Filipino's exclusively as stewards and to make the rate comparable to all the other rates in the Navy.  In other words killing the fact that this is where the minorities went.  Every Admiral and everybody around who had these--these individuals you know were mortified about this and it went through and for me, although there were many other things, this was personally satisfying that someone who is as impotent as you could possibly to do anything would finally do any--find themselves in a position one day to get a change across, that could been my plight if I had acquiesced at that moment, but I had a number of experiences there--there is another one, that if I may refer to your book--.
Story_ID: 11455
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the two books "On Watch" and ("Bloods"?).
Speaker 2: The other one was called ("Bloods"?) by Wallace Cherry.  He was a reporter for the New York Times.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know if you know Wally, he's, he's--but my brother was in the Army and in fact he has five pieces of shrapnel embedded in his spinal cord today and we were in Vietnam at the same time, and--and it was a very difficult experience for him, but he (pause) came to me and wanted to do some interviews and this--and this was the raw side.  This was Vietnam from the perspective of--Bloods meaning what the--the typical meaning was and he did a chapter on me and--and some of my experiences but this is Bill Norman in the raw, probably much unlike what you'd would see here and--and but it is--it is a very interesting insight in terms of what racism was like in the Navy from the--and I was one of the few officers that was interviewed within that book, but primarily because I was on someone's staff and had been involved in this kind of thing, so.
Story_ID: 11456
Speaker 1: Can you like briefly tell us a little a bit about your experiences in Vietnam?  Were you in conflict with the war or were you in--supportive of the war?  How, how were you dealing with your feelings about the war and as an African American fighting in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Well, at first it was very you know, easy.  I was in aviation.  We flew, we had missions and--and as you're going around, it's--it was no different than going out to the targets that you go to and directing and all the other things that had to happen and part of your job.  I think after a while--that was one of my first tour, but we came back home and I started thinking about what it is that we're doing and the futility of what we're doing and more and more I started to have comparatively negative feelings, but the negative feeling had to do partly with--from a military point of view that we weren't fighting a war that I thought that we should and could win because of all the constraints and everything that was on there.  The lack of popularity was no so much a portion as I could be very articulate in explaining why we were there but after a while--I--I would have more success in telling others than persuading myself about it and so I became conflicted.  I became conflicted enough in which I actually wrote about it--I would never do anything that anyone would consider disloyal.  I was a really good naval officer.  I really did things well but I--but the logic--the internal logic of what we were doing and how it was being done was that strong.  This is also another one of the reasons why I was leaving the military and it was--and it was also equally true that it was particularly difficult to be--and--to say it more generally, a minority in the military at this time, because here you are if you fly out there and I fly into Da Nang and kind of places and see them and that you were putting your life on the line--you gotta remember what the timing is in all of this.  This is early 1960s and so on and for what, you know?  You didn't really feel that--you felt a sense of patriotism that I think that I really did truly feel, but at the same time, I know that this--that going back and outside of the little cocoon of the--what it was going to be like and things were really were like and so it was not something that unique to me.  I think it was sort of prevalent among all.  You either had to do one or two things.  You could say, alright I'm going to bide my time and I'm gonna be a superb Navy/Army/Air Force officer what it is and I'm gonna excel and I'm gonna do well and therefore this is--and I'm gonna be concerned about what goes on in my own little world but not outside.  I think that for most of us that was not quite as easy to do.  There was a very difficult time and add on to that what the feelings were back home and--and the kind of pride and remember I told you that pride means a great deal to me.  I took pride in the accomplishments that I had but I didn't really feel as proud as I wanted to because in spite of all the--the successes that I had, I--I knew that in the final analysis I had to fight for all of it and it really was true, that in spite of my abilities and all the others in here, I knew I was in some ways as good or better than anyone and it took that in order to achieve.
Story_ID: 11457
Speaker 1: When you left the Navy in 1973, you went to work with Cummins Engine Company?
Speaker 2: Yes, and that's an interesting one, because I--I as I was doing this--as I said, the life of that of that and so on.  If I had decided to stay in the Navy with him--I mean he had given me the kind of performance ratings and pushed me that there was no way in which I could not have been highly successful at moving along within that time, but he also and as I said we became very close friends after I got out, but one of the things that happened is that I'd come up with an idea in the Navy and--and the whole idea in which the Navy had had this particular program is to take the--the resources of the Navy and do some things to improve conditions and community and there was this person called Erwin Miller who was chairman and CEO of Cummins Engine Company and he had their--had decided that they were gonna give five percent of their pre-tax profits to philanthropy and this was one of the really enlightened companies that you ever want to find and they had this idea and he had the head of his foundation there--their personal fortune of some-I don't know what it is, hundreds of millions of dollars and the head of the foundation was an African American by the names of James Joseph--Jim Joseph, who is now Ambassador to South Africa. But we had this idea and that what we would do, there was a community in California and in--in which the arsenic content of the wells, and it was an old African American group that had lived there for years, and the didn't want to leave and they--but the arsenic content of the wells was such that it was solely poisoning and so what we thought we would do is an arrangement by which Cummins and Company--we had the local people here to get all and take care of all the--the details.  The Navy would supply the CBs and all the others that would get it done and Cummins Engine and Company would pay for it.  So this (tri part-time?) arrangement was going to be a model of how the community, the military and the private corporations could all work together and--and we started this thing and we're doing.  That's how I got to know Erwin Miller and so at the time when things--and I can go in depths in terms of what happened in the Navy, but I think the important there was that's how I met him and they had started to ask me if I ever decided to want to leave the Navy come there.  While I--business was not something I ever thought about except back to those days of Irvine B. Klein.  I always said that's a place I which I really ought to go, and to make a long story short they made me an offer and I was going to accept.
Story_ID: 11458
Speaker 1: Except we had a series of racial problems in the Navy.  I had to testify before Congress and--and the whole Congress was saying--.
Speaker 2: What kinds of racial problems?
Speaker 1: It was based upon the notion, we had a few riots on ships, we--I had--we had put together an arrangement by which every command had to have an Assistant from Minority Affairs and the reason for that is to--to elevate the level of consciousness about what needed to be done and so on and--and this was mandated from the Chief and--and I actually had--could tell you whatever happened in every office and all the other things that's in here, but the thing happens in the military which is true that happens in many other places is that when individuals start--are kept very tightly controlled, you have what may be considered the perception of order and good discipline, but when people start getting opportunities to go to school they do the other sort of things and--and more things are happened and they see are--they are least likely to--to want to stay in that very controlled environment and we had an incident on the U.S.S. Constellation.  We had an incident that took place on an oiler, we had things and the Navy--the Congress we actually had some congressional hearings investigating the permissiveness in the Navy.  That was the way in which it was being perceived and that the breakdown of good order and discipline
Story_ID: 11459
Speaker 1: I could not leave under those circumstances and were able to work them out.  It actually ended up very, very well but it was a very difficult time and that's another separate story, but I then decided later on that for a series of circumstances, one is that my wife had unfortunately delivered twin boys who died immediately and I wanted to spend a little bit more time with her. And I thought that it was done and I went back and decided to go to Cummins Engine Company working in an area that it--what was called "corporate responsibility", and--and basically it was a concept that the chairman of the board had at the time that said that the companies and large corporations received their franchise from the public to exist and therefore they had a responsibility to be good corporate citizens, not just only in terms Atlanta but how they do business etcetera and I was brought in and this person Jim Joseph who I was telling you about, was at the time a vice president.  I was bought in as a director at a time and it was a very interesting company.  I would say that Cummins Engine Company in 1973 when I went there probably had more senior business executives who were African Americans and other minorities and probably any other in a place like Columbus, Indiana. You talk about your Peoria that you would never expect that to be, but having said that I went there and then later on-- fortunately things went well and I got involved in marketing and sales and--and from there I became vice president of the division responsible for things and I was doing very, very well and--and I moved to New York to--to run the division out there, but suddenly I was in a new world for which I had not planned and the world of business and found myself doing quite well.
Story_ID: 11460
Speaker 1: So from Cummins you went to Amtrak?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In 1979?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And can you kind of tell us a little bit about what--what the climate was like at Amtrack and what was Amtrak like in the late '70's [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Actually this was a--times were changing very fast at this particular moment.  They might not have been changing as fast as I would have liked, but they represented sea changes year after year in terms of what was happening from 1964 on and each time it--for those who were experiencing It, it's like a snail's pace, but if you were to be objective and stop by you really can see things start to occur in our overall society, and at Cummins because it was such an enlightened company, although it was in Columbus, Indiana headquartered there, the Athens of the Prairie, it was a different kind of a world.  At Amtrack it was interesting because the chairman of the board at the time was a person by the name of Allan Boyd.  Allan Boyd had been the first Secretary of Transportation and I had met Allan when I was a white house aide many, many years ago and so on.  Basically I was recruited but I was recruited at a moment that was very important in my life and my wife who lived in Connecticut, she really didn't like Columbus, Indiana. And when I told her about this going back to--a new promotion back there again, she said as many spouses say, oh, "Bill I'm so happy for you," and you sort of knew the story.  While it was at the time that this recruiter was coming in and I never really thought about going to Amtrak as a career move and so on.  It was convenient.  It was headquartered near Washington, D.C.  My wife, although she was reared in Europe actually was born in Washington, D.C. at--at the time and her parents had moved back here.  Her father was a principal and--of American schools in Europe and had been over there for a while and was coming back.  So the idea of coming--all of this in here together and by this time we had two children.  The two children that couldn't come were born fourteen months apart and when I was recruited I said I will come but under the condition that I will only do this for about three years and--and will do some other things, because even though it was a private corporation because of its entanglement with the government, I kind of considered (unclear) very close as kind of quasi-government.  They did not like that.  Amtrak was different because you have to remember that there is a history of the railroads that go back to the industrialization almost to this country in terms of when things were taking place and so as a result it was a huge organization with most of the African Americans in jobs that had been part of what's happened in the railroads and the dining car and work in there but it was not a very, very well integrated environment, but if you looked at the numbers it was--.
Speaker 1: The corporate environment?
Speaker 2: The--the corporate environment.  You'd look at un--this is how many minorities you have and this is how many this--they would look--on very, very well.  I came there as a vice president of marketing.  I eventually as you know became executive vice president--the number two person there, but I was in a position where I could make changes.  I could direct changes and so as a result, it was a condition in which people knew how strongly I felt about people and as part of my management style I believe very strongly in empowerment and team work and having individuals to work together and how to get the best from them and so as a result it was--it was easy because if I would see some conditions that needed to be changed, I was in a position to make certain that they would occur, and so--and so therefore what eventually ended up happening is that we had minorities and women rising up to higher levels because we could make that and at any given time there was some very interesting person Harold Henderson, who is now the Executive Vice President of the National Football League, who was a general counsel who was there.  We had my--my chief financial officer and the head of my information system were--were minorities.  I had women who were in--and this is sort of their--in fact one of my chief--my senior vice president here of--of government affairs and member programs was their--was one of our vice presidents in my group there was chairman of the executive committee and so we had a very diverse group and was able to do some things so when you ask me what the environment was, it was--one of the good things about being a position to effect change is that you can really make them, so it was--from my perspective it was perhaps much more tolerable than anything else because if something was not being done I could look at myself and say, I'm not either being sensitive enough or so on to get them done.  So, Amtrack really made some very, very significant moves.  I was personally responsible for introducing continuous quality improvement which is a way in which we did business and for an old railroad to be able to do that and so I look back on those--on that period in which we look at the accomplishments, not only in terms of how we were able to increase the revenues and to the--all the new business lines and to--it really was a--I really can say I hope in a very balanced way a much different organization than I left than when I came for the fourteen years that I was there.
Story_ID: 11461
Speaker 1: Were you starting to develop an interest in the travel industry when you went to Amtrak?
Speaker 2: I would wish that I could tell you that my life has been such that I've been plotting what I'm gonna do next and so on.
Speaker 1: But were you finding the travel industry interesting?
Speaker 2: I found--I--I really have found many things of which I'd gotten in there because I've always had this philosophy that whatever I was gonna do, I was gonna do well and was going to excel in it.  So, it wasn't so much that it--it was in the travel industry--I--if serendipity I had--it had been another kind of industry the same thing might have occurred.  I do believe that that is true.  However, I do want to emphasize that I did enjoy it very much.  It--I--I enjoyed the environment.  I enjoyed travel.  I got immediately on as fate would have it because I was the chief marketing officer there at the time.  The Travel Industry Association of America for which I am today had this organization of chief marketing officers from all the major corporations around and it was an interesting one because I ended up chairing that and--and there was not a world in which--it was basically the travel industry (unclear) essentially at that level, particularly in marketing there were white males and I mean it--trust me and those--those kinds of terms, but I became interested and I actually was elected to the Board of the Travel Industry Association for which I am now here and not only was I elected to the Board and on the Executive Committee, but I was elected by the membership as the National Chair, so even though it never crossed my  mind that I would end up being over here, I'd become very interested in travel and tourism and its impact on the social, economic and cultural fiber of this nation and--and Amtrak given my particular role and what I had there, I was able to have a--a leadership role within the industry and so asking me in terms of what it is I--I think if you look in terms of the accomplishment of what it--and what it means, Amtrak was--was always to me the little train that can.  It was the job at which I'm gonna do this one more year because there is such herculean tasks and if I can just finish this and the bar kept moving and moving and suddenly I found myself--my--maybe I was not bright enough or smart enough--maybe it took me fourteen years what I should have been able to do in the three years, but I did--I kept doing one more year.
Story_ID: 11462
Speaker 1: You--came to the Travel Industry Association of America as the Chief Executive Officer in 1994?
Speaker 2: This was a backdoor move.  At the time I had--it was a--a particular difficult time because I was the number two officer there.  There were some--Graham Clayter (ph.) who was chairman was doing everything cause he wanted me to takeover as CEO in here.  There were some political aspects for which I was not prepared to be a part of and--but anyway to make a--I had decided at a particular time with my children ready to go to college and all else.  My daughter at the time was--had just gone to the University of Virginia and a son of mine was getting ready to go to college then--maybe this is the time to make--to go make some money.  I had gotten an offer, a very, very attractive to be CEO of a company operating out of New York and--but it was outside of the travel industry and the--the president at the time (unclear) I--I explained to him that I was going to be doing he says, and I was--happen to be chairman of the compensation committee and we were in the process of going over his contract for renewal of a three-year contact and his name was Ned Brook and said to me, Bill, you can't leave the industry and I said yes, he says, well look, why don't you come over and take my job--oh, gee, no--no way, and I think an honest statement to make is if--and so that you can know that in everything that I've done there is probably nothing I've done where I've carefully planned my next step.  If I had listed a hundred things that I would be doing, this would not have been one of them, and so, as I was kind of moving on, Ned got the chairman and all the other people and they thought, he's gonna be leaving and they decided to make me an offer and I never said yes, but I also never said no, and we sort of went there and I came and they actually voted--the board actually voted that I would become the new president CEO and Ned would leave it but if I did not Ned would remain and he was willing to do this and I came in sort of backing it.  Probably of all the decisions that I've made I made one of the best ones, because I have to admit that these past--these ten years have been extraordinary.  I mean this is a huge industry of $555 billion dollar industry and it's impact is very, very great and I think that what has happened has happened because it was not just something that became a job, but it became a passion for me or it is now.  A passion for me and has we look at this--this Association is an umbrella group that represents the whole of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Industry to promote and facilitate increased travel to and within the United States.  Forgive me, I sound like I'm on a soap box now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter.)
Speaker 2: Now you got me in my other mode now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter.) That's okay.
Speaker 2: I think what is most significant about all of it is that if I take all the kinds of experience and so on and say where as you get to what is getting close to the twilight of your life, what would you like to be doing?  It is something that would give you an enormous quantity of satisfaction, a way to take advantage of all of the skills and abilities that you've had and bring them all together and do them in such a way that you can feel that you can leave a legacy, that would be very important.
Story_ID: 11463
Speaker 1: What impact did September 11th have on the travel industry?
Speaker 2: It was devastating.  The travel industry when the time that I'd come had been having an unprecedented growth and the year 2000 everything was a record.  Every segment of the industry--the airlines, the rental car companies, theme parks and attractions, cruises, on and on and on were doing extremely well, but in March of the year 2001, we started the recession and things started to change and although it was not obvious to everyone, you could start getting business declines throughout the nation and when nine eleven occurred, it actually--what really occurred is that this was the precipitating event in which it--sort of things just sort of fell off and the travel industry was hit harder than any other industry because it actually, virtually stopped and--and here we were in an environment and I'll always remember it because I was here at the (Willett?)) (ph.) Hotel with a member of Congress and a friend of--it happened to be a friend of mine who is the ambassador now to the organization for--for security and a corporation in Europe and we were there, I just happened to be meeting with him yesterday.  He's back here visiting and we were talking about that moment and that day and I came back here and all the employees were sitting here with a--in the Washington office we have office here and outside the country, but the Washington--sort of glued to the television in which the--because I--cell phones couldn't work and I'd come back over and then I realized that this was not like anything that ever had occurred and something really significant happened that changed our industry.  We realized here the impact of what was going on and so in a period of forty-eight hours--I mean I virtually didn't sleep, we put together a recovery plan.  A plan that was oriented to (unclear) first of all insuring that our industry was indeed safe and secure--all the other aspects and secondly, after making certain that was to occur to then ask individuals to come back and travel.  We put together--I immediately applied a million dollars, in fact, and started a campaign.  We surveyed everybody who put together--we put together a--a program including getting the President of the United States, as you remember, to come forth and do a national ad for us on behalf of our industry. To do it and what I think was so significant about this, is that in this lowest moment that our industry--all across the industry, everyone was there.  We lost more jobs as an industry than anything else.  We had more of an impact negatively on everything that's going on but our industry came together in a more united way than it ever has so that now and the only reason that I've made the decision now to retire is that the recovery is--is fully underway, but it was devastating and all of us remember I think that in the most difficult moment for our industry, it was the most defining and finest moment in terms of putting together a framework collectively to come back together.
Story_ID: 11464
Speaker 1: The recovery plan was it geared more to making people outside of the U.S. feel comfortable coming to the U.S. to visit as they had before had considered or was it geared more to making people within the U.S. feel more comfortable in terms of traveling within the country?
Speaker 2: It was geared first and foremost to make certain that with all the things that we had, that we had to know that our industry was safe and so therefore there was a lot of congressional things in terms of what did with aircrafts and ships and trains and little cars and you just name them in here.  That was a large kind of--sort of introspectively working to make certain that we really could say to the public we're safe, come back to us and then after we were assured of that and large part of that--before we would ever advertise or to do anything, we need to redo that.  So there was a lot of legislation.  It was a lot of other things that happened and then after knowing and feeling and knowing whether saying with certitude that it was safe and secure then the next step was to say to individuals, now come back, both domestically and internationally, and so we ran not only advertisements because during the entire period we ran--we had everyone to drop all the ads until we knew that that was being done, and so we came out collectively as an industry to do that with legislative kind of things and it was a program that was so broad--and you shouldn't be interested in seeing it but it had all kind of elements.  There are twenty seven--our industry is such that we only had--our members that--that we have are all organizations and not the individuals one.  We have some 2500 companies and organizations.  I mean it's huge and perhaps more so importantly, there's all of these groups are vertical.  So there's a hotel industry of all the major hotels who are members, but they also have an association and there are twenty six of those things and so you have the heads of all these associations and so, Dexter showed you a picture in which I bring together all of these others under this umbrella for which we--we lead this to talk about how we do it so we can--we know exactly what is happening and how we all work together.  In that effect of all of it I might add in here is that not only do we have recovery, but we have other kind of problems because our biggest issue today--we do the generic, all the research for travel and tourism we--we take care of and not only for government affairs but our--we do marketing, domestic and internationally which is really significant and that's we have offices in Europe and South America and Asia, but what is so significant about this today is with everything recovering, one of the residual things that we are dealing with is people coming to the U.S.  I represent--we are the only industrialized country in the world without a national tourism office and although we represent the private sector when we have to have representation internationally, we do it on behalf of industries. But one of the things--and so the World Tourism Organization--I'm on the strategic planning committee for the--for the--it's an agency of the U.N.  But the only reason I'm telling you this is that the world has changed, because the recovery was stopped by many things in terms of people coming in and--we had SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome].  We had the war in Iraq.  You just name something in the worldwide economy.  We've had everything like locusts coming around here.  Well we finally got this happened, but what is now left is that there's still this residual feeling that were are spending a great deal of time on in terms of people coming to this country. Because there are images of the U.S. in terms of what it is and what it's stands for and you--you--although everyone says we like the people of the U.S. and as a government it is a--it is not the best of all possible positions.
Story_ID: 11465
Speaker 1: We were talking a little bit about the recovery program in place, but now just the current situation in terms of people coming to visit.  Do you--does it seem there a lot of issues at hand and the lack of a national tourism office?
Speaker 2: I--I there are two things.  One is the industry really is coming back.  Hotels--the hotel industry, cruise lines and theme parks, attractions, cruises you just name them all there--they really are and the growth that we have.  We are getting close back to where we were in 2000, except for the airlines.  The airlines is the one sector of our industry that is still lagging, and they are lagging because of this bifurcation.  The legacy airlines are having a great quantity of difficulty, American United, Delta and U.S. Air.  The new starts such as Jet Bluest, they are doing well because the unit cost and--and that's all gonna have to work it's way out, but it's all moving in the right directions although they are losing an enormous quantity of money.  They probably will lose as an industry some five billion dollars this year, but overall it's going very, very well.  International travel is being aided in some ways because of the dollar and it's a better bargain to come here--I am sounding all like a commercial, but I--I would indicate in this regard.  There is one problem that we still have, it's the image of the abroad.  Something that we are very concerned about.  There is the sense here that we have become--I don't want to put this in terms of political terms but I think that there is a sense that there's a kind of arrogance here and it's not just the war, it's the fact that we--the notion that we want to go it alone or that we are not a welcoming organization or country and there we have spent an enormous quantity of time on barriers to travel internationally, but--but because in the name of safety and security we've enacted a large quantity of rules and regulations and if you would ask me I could go about  (unclear) to give you examples of this that says to one you're not welcome here.  So what we are really working on is to show that the welcome mat is in fact open and so we spend an enormous quantity of time and it is not so much the legislation that we get in here.  It is to try to balance, because we as an industry want to have safety and security.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But you also want to have the kind of environment in which this is a free country because travel is a very important freedom that we all want to--to retain and--and to help to nourish and to grow and so, just to answer your question very specifically, a lot of our actions have tended to the wrong message and many people who would come to this country say I don't want to be here.  It's too hard to get a visa and you try to that and people will go to other things in here and although the numbers are growing, our slice of the pie has declined some 35 percent during this particular period.  It is now coming back slowly and--and I think that in the aftermath of the Iraq war, one of the things that has started to happen is we are reaching out to get more people involved, but remember we really did take a position, post 9/11 it--it was our way and you were either with us or you were against us.

Speaker 1: What would you say to someone who asks you if it's safe to travel to the U.S.?  Is travel--and within the U.S. safe?
Speaker 2: I would say the answer is unequivocally yes.  In fact it's kind of interesting.  Immediately after the--the event so nine eleven, we have enormous research group here that surveys everything connected with it and we took all kind of information.  We surveyed twenty-five thousand households months to get a guess of how people are feeling and doing.  It wasn't very, very long in the weeks after 9/11 in which the issues of safety and security became a very small part of whether or not individuals will not travel.  A bigger one had to do with the economy and what was happening in their pocketbooks and things of that nature.  Today, if you would reach a survey is it safe and secure to travel?  You have to put in context because the world has changed.  In other words, if you are talking about 2000, you didn't go to the airports and stand in line and do all the other things.  Today, this has become--there's a new kind of normalcy, and within that context the new kind of normalcy, I think the overwhelming quantity of individuals would say, that's the least of my concern, although and in fact if there is a danger at all-- becoming after all the code oranges and all the other things--me a little too blasé about it but we take it as a way of doing it more of as a hindrance as opposed as we are afraid that something is gonna happen to us while we are in the airplane or the train or the bus or on the cruise line or any theme park, etcetera.

Speaker 1: Mr. Norman when you look back over your life what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: I think that the thing that I am most pleased about is that I've always tried to be the best that I could be.  I've always had a concern and interest in people and I've never forgotten the kind of world and environment in which I lived and hope that my children and their children will not have to experience those kind of things, that they will be considered and judged by their individual merit and worth.  I--this is something that I've always felt very strongly about and I can look back on my life in the very small environment in which I've had to--to operate like a laboratory from--and be able to show and to see that I was able--either through advocacy or direct actions to do some things that would make a difference that they're--they're better than they'd be--I'd look at that, but also I would be very straightforward with you.  Mine is much broader than that in all the dealings that I have, I have never thought about myself as an African American trying to make it the world.  I've never, I've always believed that in terms of competitiveness and the others that I was simply a person who--could be done and I was never going to be limited by those kinds of things in spite of all the limitations that were around me, and that I think I've been lucky and good because I also grew up with individuals and which things went and it could have happened to me. Fortunately, it did not so that in that regards I am somewhat blessed.  I think the second thing is that I have--I had a family who had a sense of values that was instilled into me early enough that a lot of the wrong decisions that could have been too easily have made were eschewed because that was not the way in which I hoped that my life could be and I can use along the way many things that happened.  So I was fortunate having a very good nurturing family, the opportunity to be a (unclear) in terms of an innate ability bright enough to be able to use these things to my advantage.  To have a heightened--out--a sense of--of outrage against injustice, but at the same a sense of proportionality that I'd never want to be on the soapbox making things.  I'm more interested in the outcome and the change and--and getting it done than--than sitting around talking about it.  I've always been a kind of a action oriented.  I think that if I'd look back on my life here now, there is a sense that there are always things that I could have done different or in another way, but I--and in the old Frank Sinatra's verse, I kind of did it my way.  I think I'm better off for having done it.

Speaker 1: What advice would you have for someone who is considering a career in the Navy?  What advice would you have for an African American?
Speaker 2: In the Navy?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: I think that in spite of all the things that I went through and if you would look at it you would say, my gosh.  How could anyone have gone there and--and managed to survive in that environment?  But there was some things in here that came through . As you know, even though I got out of the Navy, after eleven years, seven months and twenty-eight days, not that I count it, over the time I actually stayed I the Reserves and became a Captain in the U.S. Navy and actually ended up getting enough time to retire because I was a consultant to the Chief of Naval Operations and so I--I stayed on the Board of Directors on the U.S. Naval Memorial Foundation and I have had a very strong and close connection with the Navy.  I--so it's not a--a sense of bitterness and all that, what I would say to a young person, particularly an African American is that the opportunities for getting skills and trainings of how to interact effectively with others of being able to have challenges and learn how to overcome and--and hurdles in a very competitive environment, a chance to see and experience the kind of things in a microcosm that you might not be able to see in this society at large builds not only character, but it also enables you to  move forward, so in spite of all the things that I happened, I would encourage a young person to take advantage of that kind of experience.  Not necessarily for a career, but in terms of all that comes herewith because I think that--though I think today my concern about people--my ability to manage, my concerns about empowerment and how you do it, how you do teamwork, continuous improvement and all those things are attributes of what came from my overall Naval experience of being able to build an environment in which you go into a situation that you live or die, depending up how well you are able to interact with one another.  That's it--an experience that has, and if you take advantage of that, that can be very important.

Speaker 1: One of the most discouraging things that I see and I'm particularly concerned about that, having a son is--is watching what's happened to young, young black men today and--and where their value systems have become "it's cool to do this and cool to do that", and almost all of them are leading the way from things that can allow them to be, not only--I don't mean just productive contributors to society but to themselves and their families and everything that's in there.  It's a very sad experience it's one of the groups that I'm in, this "Bollet" (ph.), it's a group of--you may be familiar with all of that--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then there happens to be one here in Washington, "Epsilon" (ph.), and one of the things we talk about a great deal is people in there who've had the opportunity to be successful is that we often are concerned about what can we do to make an impact?  Unfortunately, in too many ways this young generation sees us as detached, caring, but--but much too detached, and so my judgment is being able to reach out one at a time--my--my son, in spite of all the experiences, I wanted him to have a different kind.  My son went to a historically black college, Hampton University, although he had the opportunity and he wanted to do it, I didn't push him into that kind of environment because he said to me, "D"ad, all my life I've never live in anything but an environment where it was the only or something that I wanted--go to place for once that I'm not.  I was very taken and--and proud of that, but I think the thing that has happened is I've always been concerned and I didn't want to keep him insulated because he has to live in the overall world in here, but it is a sad thing.  I--I thing that if I look on our overall society and things have a way of working out, but the saddest part that I have is I'm concerned that a generation of young African American males are--are not moving at the pace in which we had at other times with more opportunities.  Primarily, because it is has become much too easy for those who want to excel or those who want to do things are--are instead of being perceived as someone who should be lauded, is perceived as often, as somewhat to be shot, and I mean you know there are the geeks or the this or the other kind of things and so those would have great skills.  I've tutored and worked with young people, and they're embarrassed they don't want to be seen going through that kind of process. Again, I think that this is something that is happening but still is sad because I've always--I feel very strongly about excellence and people becoming the best they can and so many of them are not.

Speaker 1: Lastly, what you think Mr. [Irving] Klein would think about all of your accomplishments and what you've done with your life?
Speaker 2: I think that if he were sitting here looking at me today, there would be a combination of--of great pride because he never really believed--I think that his notion of--that for me was not that I might be able one day at my very best to--to maybe be a supervisor someplace or to do something or anything, that was the context, but I think he also recognized that I had the potential, in spite of my--the way I talked and all the others to be much better.  I think that--that in today's context, if he were alive, he would be considered one of the--probably would be one of the more enlightened businessmen around because at that you have to remember contextually and I mean this positively and I hope I didn't talk derisively about him, but I think that he really wanted to do some things to make a difference in an environment that--that didn't allow that to happen.  I think that the old Mr. Klein of yesterday would--would be very hardened by it.  The old Mr. Klein if he had lived in the context of today, would--could be euphoric.

Speaker 1: Thank you very much Mr. Norman, and thank you for being so gracious with your time and sharing your story with us.
Speaker 2: Well thank you and I must tell you--you've been wonderful.  I--I as indicated this is the first time I've ever talked about it and I--I don't know if I've ever rambled as much as I've rambled because in talking with you it's been a moment of reflection, but the point is that is that it's been very interesting because it's the kind of reflections and though that I had not--some of which were painful and therefore I--I would not talk about, but you made it very, very easy.  So I thank you for--for this and actually I'm kind of pleased.  I went back and I had a chance to do it and--and last night I made a decision, which I never would have done.  I'm gonna trace those--that Indian tribe and find out where they are.  I'm not gonna do--but I'm gonna get enough because there is--I'm a part of all those and being I hadn't thought much about the fact that my grandfather who I never knew, who died, while I was born I never remember him.  He was part of an industry that I was a part of and what they all had so, this was a positive experience and--and even though I apologized that I had started at 10:00 p.m. last night and doing it through the night, this has been a moment of great reflection and I thank you for how easy you made.  You're not just easy to look and talk to but--but you make it very, very comfortable and you're a good interviewer, you're a very good interviewer.
