 Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  O. Brown  B. Brown  Lemons  We   ll start by letting each of you introduce yourselves, so your name, where  you were born and when you were born.  My name is Bonnie Louise Bouse Brown, and I was born in Shattuck,  Oklahoma June the 13, 1919. My mother   s family came from Norwood, Lucas  County, Iowa. My father   s family came from Crawford County, Bourbon,  Missouri, and my father   s occupation was a tin smith. My mother had no  employment. She didn   t work out  of the home  any, except after my Dad died,  of course there was no Social Security or anything for women. Dad had a  business and he had a lot of work out on credit and an awful lot of people  thought that when my father died that that canceled their debt, so she didn   t get  a lot out of that. She did babysitting and things like that.  Did she try to collect on those debts at all or just   ?  Oh yes, she tried to, but we didn   t have the systems then that we have now,  collecting for things. She worked in a sewing room in the hard times. When we  were in the big Depression, she worked in the sewing room and washed dishes  in a caf  . That   s the reason I married pretty young because I felt like Mama  had all she could handle and if I had someone to take care of me   and it  worked out very well. We   ve been married 63 years.  (Laughs) That   s all right, I guess.  Getting close to 64.  In May it will be 64. I had an older sister, she was six years older than I, and in  between my sister and I, my mother and Dad lost a little baby girl and a baby  boy, and then I had a brother that was younger than me. He was born April 21,  1923 and he died this last year. So I   m the only one left of all the family. I  have a cousin in Shattuck and we are the only ones left out of   our parents  were siblings, there were five children in the family and they   re all gone now.  Well Don Rader is one, there   s three of us left.  What about you Mrs. Suthers, were you born here too?  5  Suthers  Lemons  Suthers  B. Brown  Suthers  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Yes, I was born here on a farm between Arnett and Gage, Oklahoma. I was  born in 1913. My mother was Carla Elizabeth Shaffer Robinson and my dad  was James Emil Robinson   they put a handle on me like Gwendolyn Lenore  Robinson.  (Laughs) Oh, goodness, and you go by Gwen instead?  I   ve lived in this county all my life. I married Hueward Suthers and lived four  miles west of Arnett. I was living there during the dust days. While I was still a  teenager and the big dust, the Black Sunday came, I had just washed a new car,  took a bath and went upstairs and my mother called and said,    There   s a  terrible storm coming, go put the car up.    I did, I ran downstairs and got in the  car. The garage doors were real narrow and I just had an inch or two to get the  car in without scratching it and I did. I came back out and when I shut the door  and looked north, the storm was just a block behind me and I started running. I  ran and I noticed the birds were just milling and it was a terrible black cloud. I  stepped up on the porch and it hit, and I opened the door and turned in and  went in. My grandmother was with us and she said,    Oh, the world is coming  to an end     But oh well. I noticed electrical lights, they turned purple, I don   t  know what it was. It was just a strange thing.  We couldn   t see a light. You could light a match and that   s it. I turned on a  light and you couldn   t see it, all you could see was black. Anything that dense  black you can   t see anything in it.  Well, my Dad and two or three other men here in town were playing golf that  Sunday afternoon and they got lost, they couldn   t see each other, so they began  yelling until they all got together and they held their golf clubs out one to  another as they walked their way back to the highway.  In your interview at Shattuck you   ve got part of what I would have to tell from  Idora Wayland, she and I were together, we lived just two blocks apart.  I know this story, but please go ahead and tell it again, let   s here your version  of it.  Well we were about half way between the two places and we saw that cloud  and she ran in her direction and I ran mine. (Laughing) Is that what she said?  She was telling me she had had chicken pox or something and she   d had to  stay in the house, and then you had come over to see her I guess and she was  supposed to walk you back home and then     And about half way we saw that cloud and    (Laughs)  (Laughing) And took off   We took off and our garage door was open. See, my dad wasn   t with us  anymore and the garage door was open and the car was in it. So I tried to lift  6  Suthers  Lemons  B. Brown  Suthers  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  O. Brown  Lemons  O. Brown  Suthers  that iron thing we had up holding the door open and I did it, and I probably  couldn   t have done it without being scared but I got the doors closed, and then  we went to the cellar. Then it was from that time   I don   t know how long that  lasted really, how long we were in the cellar, quite awhile.  My father-in-law was on horse over in the east pasture and he was on his way  home, that horse refused to go, so he just got off and settled on the bar edge  until things cleared up.  Guess you didn   t have a lot of choice.  You didn   t.  And the chickens all went to bed.  Yes, everything thought it was time to go to bed.  So you mentioned the reaction of a horse, the birds, chickens. Do you  remember any other things that different kinds of animals did? Family pets or  anything?  No, I don   t recall anything about the pets. Of course we had a dog and I   m sure  we took the dog with us, but we were down in the cellar then. I don   t know  how long we stayed down there really.  Several hours.  Did you have a similar experience with Black Sunday?  Well it was all different. We milked the cows and fed the hogs and the calves.  We got most of that done before the storm struck. When the storm struck, we  all managed to go to the cellar. After the storm had been there, it   d been  blowing about an hour. My Dad and I, we   d go to the head of the stairs and  check every once in a while to see if it   d cleared up any and it did kind of  break a little, we could see our hand in front of our face. Up when it first  struck, you couldn   t see two inches in front of your face. He just asked me to  go open the gate. The horses had to come out of the barn and run across the  road, get to the pasture there. He wanted to get the horses out of the barn  because he thought the barn was going, thought it   d blow away, because it was  about a sixty mile an hour wind, it   d be an estimate. He turned the horses loose  and I had to use a prop to open the gate because I wasn   t stout enough to just  push it back in. It was a one-by-six, five panel gate, 12, 14 foot long. But I got  it open enough that the horses got in and we got the horses out there and then  went back to the cellar and stayed until it cleared up to where we could go to  bed. But it lasted more than an hour of complete darkness. I don   t know what  was it was, two hours actually for the storm?  Probably about two hours.  7  O. Brown  B. Brown  Suthers  O. Brown  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Suthers  B. Brown  Suthers  B. Brown  Suthers  B. Brown  Lemons  O. Brown  B. Brown  O. Brown  I   d say it lasted two hours.  And then after the storm was over, that really wasn   t the end. We continued to  have dust for days and days and days.  There was lots of sediment on the ground that came out of North Dakota or  South Dakota.  I always figure eastern Colorado is where it came from, that   s where I thought.  I know I helped move a house, the old Hubble house. When they moved it up  to Carl Rowland   s, we went over there to take the roof off from it and the dust  was at least three or four inches deep in the attic. You stir that dust and it is  just fog, and there   s still dust in places in these houses that   s never been  cleaned out. You go up in the attic, you   ll find that dust and if you stir it just a  little bit it just makes a fog. It   s lighter than air. There   s no grains of dirt in it,  it   s just real sifted out.  It   s so very fine.  Just like powder.  And you put wet clothes over your faces.  I was going to ask you what did you have to do.  Yes, you had to put wet clothes.  My mother was sick and I hung wet sheets over the windows.  We all did that.  Because she had surgery in her throat.  We all had to hang wet sheets over the windows.  We hung wet sheets over the windows to keep dirt out.  And he said they put the wet gunnysacks and put over the horses mouths.  Yes, do you agree?  Well I had to save the neighbors farm. I used the Lister   we had a two-roll  Lister, which was very uncommon. Her daddy-in-law had one and we had one  and Mr. Grimes had a single roll Lister and he went to one field and I took the  big field.  This was later. (Laughs)  That was a little later in the dust storms. But, when I worked out there my  8  B. Brown  Dowler  B. Brown  Dowler  O. Brown  B. Brown  Suthers  Lemons  Dowler  O. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  Dowler  Lemons  O. Brown  Dowler  Lemons  Dowler  mother would bring a wet towel out every hour to replace over my face and we  didn   t change the horses, we   d wet    em down a little every once in a while,  because I couldn   t see the end of the tongue. The Lister is sitting up here at the  Circle E Hotel.  Oren, why don   t you move over here and let Shirley sit.  I   m not gonna be here but just a minute.  How do you know?  Cause I   ve got an eleven o   clock. (Laughter)  Why don   t you sit down?  You may get so interested here you   ll forget about time. Sit still Gwen.  No, I got to get to work and you can tell your story.  Well, thanks for stopping in and talking to us.  I wanted to hear your story.  You   re going to have to read it.  I   ll let you introduce yourself before we get you on here and can   t remember  who was talking to us.  This is Shirley Dowler.  Nice to meet you. I   m Shelly Lemon and this is Steve Kite.  Hi Steve.  We were just talking about the dust storms and he was telling us about having  wet cloth over himself and gunnysacks on the horses.  Her husband and I, we were schoolmates.  It won   t take me long to tell you what I remember. What year was it, 1930?     34,    35, yes.     35, okay. I was seven years old and lived over on the southeast corner of the  square. My dad was a Chevrolet dealer and we had a Conoco sign out front  which was a big pole on the Conoco sign and it swung back and forth. Well I  was up on it swinging, and you could see this dirt coming and everything, but  my dad was up on the house trying to hang onto shingles or something and I  can remember them yelling at me. Well if he was up on the house, I thought it  9  Lemons  Dowler  Lemons  Dowler  Lemons  Dowler  Lemons  Dowler  Lemons  B. Brown  Dowler  B. Brown  Dowler  Lemons  Dowler  Lemons  was alright for me to be out there swinging. (Laughs) We were in the process  of building a cellar, and I remember we had to finally get down the incline  because there wasn   t any steps, and it was all of the bracing and everything  you know, and it was kind of crowded and you couldn   t see a thing. So my  story   s just like everybody else   s.  How many people were in the cellar?  There was, I don   t know, there was five in my family.  That would be kind of tight, five people in a cellar.  Yes, and then all the bracing and everything because we weren   t afraid of dirt  storms, we were afraid of tornadoes   Yeah.  I remember that much about it and that   s really     Do you remember coming out of the cellar and what it looked like when you  came out?  It was just, you couldn   t breathe, you couldn   t   it was just very confining. I  guess almost claustrophobic-like and it was quite and experience. I remember  it and then I remember the snow storm that we had a couple of years later     from one extreme to the other.  Compare that to the dust storms. Which was scarier?  At least you could see in the snow storm.  Yeah.  Part of the time.  Yeah, but I remember, we were city people but Dad always had a milk cow  and I can remember us kids having to walk across the snow drift coming over  here to the north side to deliver quarts of milk. All of this was solid snow,  we   ve got pictures where they dug tunnels. I don   t remember very much but I  do remember those two incidents.  Do you remember   you were small when this is happening this time in  Arnett   what kinds of things, like if it was a typical day, what would you have  been doing for fun? Like your climbing up to swing on the sign?  Yeah, yeah.  Just to get a feel for what an average day was like.  10  Dowler  O. Brown  Dowler  Lemons  Dowler  B. Brown  Dowler  B. Brown  Dowler  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  O. Brown  We skated around the courthouse all the time, all the time, and we played up  there and how we kept from falling off around those pillars down into the  basement, law of gravity and the good lord  (Laughs) Oh, but as I said, we  grew up on the square and there was probably a theatre at that time, either here  or at Harmon   my Dad went there.  Had one of the south side of this.  Well, I don   t know how old I was but I can remember my Dad went to  Harmon and showed movies in an old garage building over there.  Do you remember any movies?  Oh, the old Saturday serials and all that sort of stuff, couldn   t miss those. My  Dad ran the theater and us kids thought it was so much fun to sneak in without  paying  (Laughs)  This was probably sometime after Black Sunday but the dust was still thick in  the air a long time, and this is a joke then, in case you didn   t figure it out.  (Laughs) A pilot flying over Amarillo looked out his window and saw prairie  dogs all over, so he reported that he looked out his window and saw a prairie  dog out there digging his hole. (Laughter)  Well it was thick enough for a while it could have been true   Well they had all kinds of jokes came out of it.  Oh yes.  Do you remember any others? No one   s ever told us jokes.  Well these dust storms continued for quite some time and later after we were  married long enough to have a senior in   well he wasn   t a senior but he was in  high school   and we had a family from New Jersey were visiting one of the  relatives, one of the families at home, and Mandel, our oldest boy was  acquainted with the young man that was visiting from New Jersey. They  corresponded for a while and we   d had a dust storm, so my son decided he was  going to send this boy a dirty letter. So, he went upstairs and took an envelope  and scraped all the dust off the window sill inside and saved it and sent him a  dirty letter  (Laughter) Well you might as well have some fun after all we   d  been through.  That   s right  So what was a typical day like for you, with or without dust?  You   d get up and what would you do each day?  Well at my age then, just routine     Well we had a dairy     11  B. Brown  O. Brown  Dowler  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Well this was back when I was little at home and I just helped Mama and we  had chickens and she milked a cow and I just did whatever I was told to do. I  remember one time when I was eight years old, before the   it had nothing to  do with the dust storm   she wanted me to do some sweeping or something,  and I was fooling around like a kid will do. We didn   t have a refrigerator, and  it was summertime, and she had the window open and pan of water, and she  set the milk in this pan of water with a cloth over it so the wind would blow  through and cool the milk   that was the only refrigeration we had   and I was  fooling around and upset it. Well I did the house cleaning, I got started  cleaning and I didn   t want to quit. (Laughs) I really did a good job, but it was  that getting started that was the problem.  She still does.  Needed motivation. (Laughs)  Now he   s telling stories on you over here   Well let   s see, here are some more questions you had: describe the house; was  it big or small or how many rooms, indoor plumbing. Well it was a small  square framed house, I think probably 32-feet it seems like it was, four rooms  and no plumbing, and one single light from the center of the ceiling. It was the  only one we had in all the house, but each room had this single light, and we   d  turn it one by reaching up and turning it on. My folks had 15 acres out at the  east side of Shattuck. In fact, we lived on the last street east of town and it   s  still the last street. (Laughs) I didn   t know it when I was little, but it   s now  Jenkins Street   well I think I knew it when I was little but it wasn   t marked, it  is now.  What did your neighbors do, occupation? Well we had, the Walton   s on the  north side of us two blocks, and the Macintosh   s were on the south side of us  two blocks and my Aunt lived up the hill west of us two blocks. I could tell a  lot of stories about that too. My Uncle Lester was a barber and his wife, my  aunt, she went to work for Dr. O.C. Newman. You want all this that stuff  aside?  Sure, yeah.  She went to work for Dr. O.C. Newman when she was 17 and he had a two-roomed  office down on Main Street in Shattuck, and he hired her to keep the  place clean and to register guests   people, patients that came in, and she  worked for him all the rest of his years. She became his right hand person. He  was gone on vacation and someone came in with a broken leg and she set it for  him, and when he came back home from vacation he examined it and  everything was just right, just like it should be. She and her husband were on  vacation in Missouri one time and they came upon a very bad wreck, and Aunt  Goldie insisted that she go with the patient up to the hospital. That was about  the time you wasn   t supposed to help anybody, but she did, and they were  opposed to that. She said,    You call Dr. O.C. Newman in Shattuck.    She got  12  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  O. Brown  B. Brown  O. Brown  B. Brown  O. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  O. Brown  B. Brown  O. Brown  B. Brown  O. Brown  the    OK.     It was all right.  Yes, let   s see, typical day     I   d like to know how you two met.  (Laughs) How we met each other?  She tells the story.  I was a freshman in the high school orchestra. He graduated early because he  went to a country school and took two years in one here, so he was ahead of  me, so he went back to school after he graduated for a post graduate course. I  played the second violin which meant I played two fingers, just two notes I  played on the violin and second violin sat over here, first violin sat over here.  He was first chair, first violin and he winked one time too many. 63 years, well  it would be more than that because we didn   t marry for a couple years after  that.  She was 19 and I was 20 when we got married.  So we had quite a romantic life. (Laughs)  Well if you want to get into subject of that, I drove the first school bus in Ellis  County at 14 years old.  Oh my gosh.  And it was an old Model-T truck  No, It was a Model-A.  It was a Model-A, with a house built on the back of it.  Yeah, first Model-A that come out.  It was tall enough you could stand up in it, and I would watch for him to come  into town. I walked to school, I had to walk a mile to go to school and as I   d  get to school I   d be watching seeing that, and you   d see the top of that thing  coming (Laughs) before you even saw it   Well they built it seven foot high when they started, Prof. L. C. Thomas, he  went downtown to the only guy in town that had the money, him and the car  dealer. He gambled and they had the money, he borrowed the money,  200.00  to build a cabin on this truck. Our neighbor, Jim Grimes bought the truck, it  was a used truck been running a year and they all decided, I   d been driving a  Model-T to high school for years before so they decided I was a good enough  13  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  Lemons  driver. I   d never had any problem and drove this fine V-8 truck. It was a 4-  cylinder. So they charged the kids a dollar and a quarter a month to ride it, and  they all had to walk out to the highway. They took the dual wheels off and  made single wheels so I could get up through the mud because, well they put  clay out on the highway and that mud got pretty deep, when they   re axel deep,  and I started driving. We didn   t have any problems. Professor, he had a big  paddle propped on his desk he made history, had a paddle in the high school  everybody knew, everybody in the school got paddled but me I think. But  when he run the whole ring, why he always left me out of it.  Here   s a question: what is your fondest memories of these times? Friends and  family for me as a child, was easy going. We didn   t have much money but we  had good times together. How did you handle your family everyday needs?  This is interesting. Mama made lard and fried the sausage and she layered the  lard in the fried sausage and when you wanted sausage you just dug down  through the lard and got sausage and walked it up.  So it preserved it in there.  That   s the way we preserved it, uh-huh.  Is that your favorite food?  Not necessarily, but food was scarce and hard to come by and you better  preserve it, and we didn   t have any refrigeration.  If you were gonna have something that was a really big treat to eat, what  would be like the biggest treat food wise, something really special?  Back in those days? Oh, I don   t know. I really can   t think of anything special.  You don   t even see    em, I don   t think you can buy    em anymore   dolls, paper  dolls. My friends and I played with paper dolls, sometimes we made our own  and sometimes we cut them out of catalogs and that was that.  Did you make clothes for them too, that you could fold on?  Oh sure, yeah we little   I still got some at home. One of my friends liked to  draw, and she was very good at drawing so she   d draw little girls and we   d  make dresses for them, fasten them on with those little things. (Laughs) I still  have those. Let   s see, what else is there now?  Do you remember ever getting a special gift toy-wise when you were a kid, like  for your birthday or for Christmas, that was your very favorite?  I don   t know if there was a favorite. I got a buggy and I remember that I got a  doll.  What   d your doll look like?  14  B. Brown  Lemons  O. Brown  Lemons  O. Brown  B. Brown  O. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  Kite  Lemons  O. Brown  B. Brown  Kite  O. Brown  B. Brown  O. Brown  Kite  O. Brown  I don   t remember. I do have a doll, well it wasn   t the one I got then though. I  really don   t remember the doll too much. I know her eyes would open and  close and she had a cloth body. Let   s see, what else?  Do you remember a favorite birthday or Christmas or holiday?  I had lots of them.  Yeah?  Nah, the thing that turned my life, my aunt bought me a violin in Fort Worth,  Texas at a pawn shop. It came from the symphony in Cincinnati, Ohio. My  Dad taught me to read the notes and count time and because of that factor I  was sought after everywhere   I tuned all the fiddles.  He still does.  Today I joined the fiddling association, what 20 years ago now? In Branson,  Missouri, we started the    Old Times Fiddlers.    I been to the state of the Ozark  fiddlers, I   ve been to Hall of Fame there.  I   d like to hear you play.  Well how long you gonna be around?  Long enough to hear him play   Well you want to go out to the house?  Let   s go.  That   d be cool, yeah.  Well you want to go up to Bob   s? That   d be a lot handier.  Well you got your fiddle with ya?  Let   s go.  Interview moves to a new location   This is my original violin. I   ve had to do some repairs on it.  Have a seat.  I took all the varnish off, put it back to its natural color. I sanded it     Look at that flame.  I sanded it all down, and I used armor coating to preserve it.  15  Kite  O. Brown  Kite  B.

Mr. Brown continues to tunes violin   I carry my instrument with me at all times because I never know when I   ll  need to use it.  Yeah.  And if I   m gonna be going some place I always have it with me. Can you pay  spoons?  Sometimes. I don   t cheat like you do though. I don   t use those cheater spoons.  I can   t hold the others together. I   ve tried but they slip around to fast.  They do, it   s hard.  It   s hard to do. I have done it but this is easier. Sit down and play a    Ho  Down    so I can play my spoons.  Oh, you want a    Ho Down    huh?  Yeah sit down over here so you can play, have a seat over here. Or sit there,  it   s much easier in that chair, there   s that arm chair over there.  Okay, I   ll sit here.  Now get with it. Play something   I   m gonna snap some pictures if you don   t mind.   Mr. Brown begins playing his violin, while Mrs. Brown joins in on the  spoons   Ah, that   s great. (Laughter and applause)  Wait a minute, where   s your case?

That   s pretty incredible, isn   t it, those deer in the  stream. That   s in Montana or something, right?  This was sent to us from a cousin out in Idaho, and we have a granddaughter  and her husband living in Alaska. They were here the other day and she said,     Well we   ve got that picture in our house.     Yeah, that was sent to me too, it   s a pretty incredible shot.  Yes it is.  It was during those forest fires out west last year.  Beautiful shot even though it is horrible shot. Would you like to try this thing?  How do you do this?  Just keep trying. Can you keep time?  Yeah I can keep time. Okay, I   ll see what I can do here.  Let   s come in and sit down.  Oh, would you look at this? I already took the leather off of it   that   s probably  close to 100 years old.  Wow.  The violin, I   ll give to my great grandson.  Look at that case.  And it   s just like it was when it was new.  Except for somebody wrote on it.  That   s gonna keep somebody from carrying it off  (Laughs) Now the violin I  give to my great grandson out in Albuquerque.  What a beautiful case.  But I   ve thought about this settlement. To be an antique, it had a leather cover  and I took that off and armor coated it. So it   s plain armor coating and I  refinished it and preserved it. It still all works.  18  Kite  O. Brown  B.

Violin music begins  Sorry, off the course. Okay, that   s  all. That   s about as good as I get.  You done real good.  Well started at Harmony, a lady came up to me over at Harrison, Arkansas and  laid a mic on my shoulder. I was playing with Birden Berry at Silver Dollar  City. He died three years ago, something like that. He always come up here  every year and played with me, and I played that harmony, and this lady laid  her mic on my shoulder and says   whispered in my ear, I couldn   t turn around  and see who it was, couldn   t, and she says,    I   m a music director,    at some  college in Missouri and said,    I want a copy of this harmony your playing.     Said,    I   ve never heard harmony like that before in my life.    So as it turned  out, she took a tape and it wasn   t two weeks I heard it on Nashville. A boy out  of Fayetteville, well a famous Arkansas fiddler, he picked it up and used it. I  told him he could take it and use it, I didn   t try to copyright anything cause it   s  not a property. I run into so many problems.  Now you   re all three ready to go.  Play that again.  I want to back out of this one.  No, No  (Laughs)   Violin music begins once again   I can   t hear myself. I don   t know whether I   m doing anything or not   I got lost in there. It took awhile to get back around to where I started.  Well that   s with me, I start out with him and then he gets ahead of me and I  can   t find him.   Music continues   I don   t know too many of your songs. I just know the standards.  Now he don   t know what a good fiddle is. You ought to try that for once.  Actually that one doesn   t fit on my hand.  Yeah, huh.  It sounds a little better with electric but. Now that hasn   t been played, I   ll tune  it up and then you can play it, sound better.  20  Lemons  Kite  Kite  B. Brown  O. Brown  B. Brown  Lemons  B. Brown  O. Brown  Kite  B. Brown  Kite  O.

I   ve had  experiences playing professionally on 101 radio station on the AM and we got  problems over that. You   ve got to have copyright before you can play a piece.  The Woodward station got in trouble?  They tried to shut me down. They did shut me down in Gage. We got live  music, we don   t play the records. They tried to stop me from playing.  Who tried to stop you?  101 AM.  Oh, okay, I get it.  They were giving that man  800 to broadcast.  And nobody listened to them.  Well we, they couldn   t draw an audience.
