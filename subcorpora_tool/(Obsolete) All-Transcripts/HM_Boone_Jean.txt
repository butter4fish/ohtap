Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions that we always ask as a warm up. They only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Yeah, Chilean sea bass.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yeah, orange.

Story_ID: 669188
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Daniel Patterson] side. We'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Sure, her full name is Helen--was Helen McIver and, Patterson [Helen Patterson] of course.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 24, 1903.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Union County, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about the, your mother's ancestor's how far back can you trace that side of the family?  And what, what do you know about their activities?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know very much.  One of the, I think hallmarks of people of her age, and if you, if you calculate my age and her birthdate, you will recognize that I was born when she was almost forty.  So there, I am truly the baby in the family, and most people had died away.  I know that she had no sisters, she had--her mother had several sisters who of course were my great aunts and I knew them.  But beyond that, and they've all passed away, so my knowledge of my ancestry on both my mother and--mother's and father's side is very sketchy.
Speaker 1: Okay now did your, your mother--I mean did her, did you know what her parents did for a living?
Speaker 2: No I did not, again they had all passed away, let me if I may say this, when, when I was born, my mother had already had two daughters.  One died in 1939 before I was born at the World, World's Fair [1939 New York World's Fair, New York, New York] and--of appendicitis.  Which says to me that there, the medicines and the ways of treating appendicitis at that point were limited, and she died in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] actually.  I have one sister [Phyllis Patterson] who's living and she is, she was around of course when, when that happened.  She's sixteen years older than I am, and what I know is what I sort of pry out of her, but again, in the '50s [1950s,] in the South at least or, or maybe more specifically my family didn't really talk about their, their history.  You picked up what you knew and if you asked too many questions, you were told, "Be quiet."
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did your mother--now did she grow up in Union County or she grow up in Columbia [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Union County to a certain age and then moved to Columbia, and she finished her schooling in Columbia.  During my formative years she worked at Benedict College, which is a small Baptist related college in Columbia.  And that was, that was our community, the Benedict and Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina] which are across the street from each other.  And two doors--two blocks down from my house, so.
Speaker 1: Now, now is Benedict a school for, for women?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, Benedict is a coed school, as is Allen University.
Speaker 1: Okay for some reason I got the impression one was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bennett [Bennett College] is.
Speaker 1: Oh Bennett is?
Speaker 2: Right and that's in Greensboro [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, thank you.  So Benedict College and now she, did she have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: She went to a two year college which at that time was called I think a normal school and--in the South and that was the extent.
Speaker 1: Okay so did she teach at Benedict and--or did she (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No she was part of the library system including the bookstore; she ran the bookstore and was a librarian.
Speaker 1: Okay, so normal school generally trains you to teach, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Story_ID: 669189
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's Daniel Webster Patterson [Daniel Patterson] (laughter), Daniel, D-A-N-I-E-L, Webster, W-E-B-S-T-E-R and Patterson, P-A-T-T-E-R-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Now his, his name have anything to do with the dictionary?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You wonder, I don't really know, again, my father died when I was four, so I don't have, I had no conversations of substance with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do, do you know when he was born?
Speaker 2: I honestly don't, I, I think it was in nine- in 1898, but I'm--not sure.
Speaker 1: And was he from Columbia [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: He was from Fairfield County, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay now once again, I have to ask question now what, what can you, well what can you tell us about his side of the family, anything?
Speaker 2: Again very little.  His, his sis- one of his sisters was very close to our family and her, her chil- their children, she was married.  My first cousins we were close, again all have died because of where I sit in the, in the family, line up so to speak.  So there are, there are few people for me to get a real rich history from.
Speaker 1: Now are these like rural areas of Fairfield County, when you say like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and Union County [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So I imagine I would guess their, their families were farmers or something or doing some king of agrarian thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I would imagine, I would imagine but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Speaker 2: And that's one of the--that's one of the regrets that I have that I don't know more about the history of my family.  And I've often thought about trying to do some ancestral research, but time just never has made its way to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now yeah, so what were, were they religious, did they go to church or?
Speaker 2: Oh sure my, my mother [Helen Patterson] was Baptist; I grew up a Baptist in the Baptist church, Second Calvary Baptist Church in Columbia.  And my father was a member of the A.M.E.Z. church and--
Speaker 1: A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion], yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is one, is Benedict, or does, is Allen a, is a regular A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, right?
Speaker 2: Right and--
Speaker 1: I mean a co- college, Allen--
Speaker 2: College, college--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Allen, and--
Speaker 2: Actually they were Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina] for as long as I can remember, and Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina] Baptist, Allen A.M.E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was a friendly rivalry between (laughter) the two schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think it was--other school in South Carolina's Livingstone [sic. Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina] or something, or that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's--
Speaker 1: A.M.E. Zion, A.M.E., that's in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: That's in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Yeah, A.M.E. Zion.
Speaker 2: There's, there's Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And there's South Carolina State [South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], which again is one of those schools that's, especially in sports, rivalries there.
Story_ID: 669190
Speaker 1: From what you understand about your mother [Helen Patterson] and maybe what you've heard about your father [Daniel Patterson], when you consider their personalities and what they looked like and maybe their opinions and sense of humor and other things, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I guess I would have to say my mother because she was the influence in my life growing up, I was fully grown and, and in my forties I guess when she passed away.  So she was the only influence, it's, it's interesting to me to reflect the fact that when I was living and working in Baltimore [Maryland] in the '80s [1980s], I would see young women with babies in strollers.  And I thought ah, they're like me they, they have young siblings and there, you know it's like they're teenagers and they have a, there's a young sibling there.  No.  Those were their babies and I was, I was so I guess influenced by my birth order, I thought everybody else (laughter) was like that, but yeah.  So my mother was my influence, and she was, she was pretty strict.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 669191
Speaker 1: Do you have a earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah I do, I have, I have one of my dad [Daniel Patterson] and me and my family taking Sunday afternoon rides across bridges in, in Columbia [South Carolina].  There's a particular bridge that, and I can't remember, I think it was the Congaree River bridge.  But I was always fascinated, I wanted to go across the bridge, but then I was afraid of the bridge.  So (laughter) you know it's like trying to--but my dad would always do that, I remember that, even though I was four when he passed away, I remember that, yeah.
Speaker 1: So it was a particularly scenic bridge or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and it was--again the water was down below and we were up and, I just, I thought that was fascinating.
Story_ID: 669192
Speaker 1: Columbia [South Carolina]--the black community in Columbia, is there--there a name for it, or the name for the neighborhood that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: I grew up in Waverly [Columbia, South Carolina] which is now a historically designated community so--
Speaker 1: Now what, what makes it historical?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I mean it was the hub of the black middle class as defined by neces- not necessarily financial wealth.  But it was, it--there were professionals, all of whom lived there, and homes were owned by black people, I mean very few renters if at all.  And people who lived in that community or who grew up in that community went on to do, you know, important things.  I can remember from my high school, there were people who went from my high school, C.A. Johnson High School [Columbia, South Carolina] to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] directly, to Iowa State [Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa] directly.  To Bennett College [Greensboro, North Carolina], I mean to schools that were of you know of, of good standing and when I think about it that was pretty remarkable.  Because we were a segregated, highly segregated and highly insulated community.  But we were always told that if you study hard, and keep your eye on the prize you can, you can make it.
Story_ID: 669193
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, well one (laughter) one is kind of funny to people who didn't experience it, I thought it was just normal.  There were people from the county, Columbia [South Carolina] is, is the capital of course and there are coun- there's Richland County [South Carolina] that, that Columbia is a part of.  In the county, people were farmers for the most part and women used to come in on trucks, I guess men too, but the women would walk the streets.  And in the summertime they would sell blackberries and other fruits, and they would sing out what they had.  Like, "Blackberries, blackberries, fresh blackberries," and you could hear the sound through the, you know through the, the community.  And if you wanted your, wonderful fresh blackberries, you went out, and you stopped the lady and she came in and your mother bought the blackberries.  And that afternoon there was a blackberry pie, so that's one of those memories that you know, I think are kind of idiosyncratic to, to me and the people who lived around me.
Story_ID: 669194
Speaker 1: Black communities all over the country at one time had those kind of--you know.  I remember watermelon man used to come through the black community in Dayton [Ohio] singing about watermelons, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you just don't hear that anymore, anywhere, you know.
Speaker 2: No, no.  When I lived in Baltimore [Maryland] there were what they call arabs [sic. arabbers] and these were black men who were on, on carts on, on and, and they were horse draw, drawn, and they would have fruit.  And they would sing out whatever they had, but that's the closest thing that I know to that kind of way of selling, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah it is unique for that period of time, it's hard, hard, you don't--I don't know any, is there, if there's any place where you hear that anymore.
Speaker 2: Yeah I don't know, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in the '80s [1980s] in Baltimore that was happening.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and city government actually, city government tried to, or there were people, I guess it was government, that was trying to make that go away.  Mainly because the animals were also kept in backyards in the city, in the middle of the city.  And I think there was a sanitation issue that they were trying to address, and actually I was in a position to help some of the arabs, as they called themselves, to figure out a way to mitigate the problems that the government thought they had, so.
Speaker 1: Now this is something that I vaguely heard of this before but apparently alluding to not just individuals who, I mean you, you're talking about a whole culture, I guess?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: A subculture I guess of black people called arabs.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Who, who--were they, were they Muslim by--at all or were they?
Speaker 2: You know I don't know where the name--where the label or name came from. When I came to know them that's what they were called.  And I don't--I assume they call themselves that, but you know most of the time it was ref- they were referred to by a third party.  So who knows?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what--yeah they, they seem to have a lifes- so they, did they travel around (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They had a lifestyle, but they lived in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So they were--
Speaker 2: Yeah they lived, yeah they were residents, and they were black people, they were not, they were not immigrants, they were not foreign born, came to Baltimore.  They, they lived in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay and they, they had domesticated farm animals in the city?
Speaker 2: They had, they had donkeys or horses that, that, that carried the, the wagons and they sat you know, and guided.
Speaker 1: Okay so I imagine they, they had been at this for a while, so, so you know--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah (laughter) yeah.
Speaker 1: Donkeys in the city, they just probably never stopped, I guess, yeah.  Okay we'll have to find out more about them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah you'll have to.
Story_ID: 669195
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your grade school in?
Speaker 2: In Columbia [South Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Waverly [Waverly Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Named for the community.
Speaker 1: And did you like school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, sure did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right did you have a favorite subject in school or?
Speaker 2: I guess social studies, and geography.
Speaker 1: And did you know how to read before you went to school?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Yeah I think I did, you're asking me to think way, way back now.
Speaker 1: Well this is significant as being your mother [Helen Patterson], she probably did get some kind of teaching degree, and so she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I did--I did know; I'll tell you, let me tell you what was the most memorable thing for me in grade school.  Remember I told you my father [Daniel Patterson] died when I was four, and for some reason if anything went wrong at school, not because I did something, but because, 'cause I was, I was a good girl (laughter).  But if the teacher said, "You have to stay after school because," whatever it was, I would cry, I would cry.  And then and this was like in third or fourth grade, she, she would then say, "We can't--you cannot leave until Jean [HistoryMaker Jean Boone] stops crying."  That put such a heavy burden on me to stop crying and then I wanted to cry more.  But the point is that, that is what I remember from, from my grade school.  I remember my fourth grade teacher being one who loved art, so art was a part of everything that we learned.  Whether it was math or, or--arithmetic we called it--or reading or whatever.  But I loved to read and there was a--again, very segregated, okay my community, but there was a black library.  And I--in the summertime I would get dressed for the afternoon. Again we're, we're very southern.  And I would drive, I would--drive, I would walk around the corner and up the street to the library and get two books.  I would read those books and then the next week, I'd take them back and, so yeah I was, I, I read a lot.
Story_ID: 669196
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah in high school [C.A. Jones High School, Columbia, South Carolina], my Latin teacher (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And, but I tell people I had a Latin teacher in segregated Columbia [South Carolina], they're like, "You took Latin?"  Yeah I took Latin.
Speaker 1: Latin was--Latin was almost requirement in the schools in the early days, I mean in--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah okay.
Speaker 1: Not until I guess until about 1965 or so, most public schools required Latin in high school.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I took it and we (laughter) she was, she was a very, very strict teacher and she would, we, we--Latin was not easy.  And so she, we would often say to each other, "What did she say?"  And she would turn around, "Don't call me she, I have a name."  And her, her lesson was, don't ever refer to a person that is in your presence by a pronoun.  Always say their name, "What did Mr. Jones say," and I remember (laughter) that to this day, she thought that was (pause) impolite, so.  So we have a lot of you know lessons about morality and politeness and southern etiquette I'd guess you'd say.
Speaker 1: Yeah social, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 669197
Speaker 1: What did you like to do in school, were you a member of clubs or did you like sports or did--what did you like?
Speaker 2: Oh man you're, you're asking me to dig way back here.  Let's see, what did I, what clubs did I like?  I can't, I can't actually remember, I remember being in (laughter) this sounds so dorky, I was in the homemakers club of America [Future Homemakers of America]. That I remember.  But beyond that I can't, I was, I was on the girls drill team. I wasn't that great at it but I was on it, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and so did you get a chance to get to all the games and that sort of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sure did.
Speaker 1: All right, all right and you said you had a, did, now this is, now C.H. Johnson?
Speaker 2: C.A. Johnson [C.A. Johnson High School, Columbia, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: C.A. Johnson--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --High School.  Now did that, was that, was that a high school that served a lot of the surrounding communities in Columbia [South Carolina] too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, it served our community, in other words folk who, students who came from Waverly [Waverly Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina], and then there was another school, Carver Elementary [Carver-Lyon Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina].  Mr. Johnson [Cornell Johnson] by the way was a superintendent of schools that--for whom the sch- a local person for whom the school was named.
Speaker 1: Was this a black person?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes and he had been the black superintendent of schools because again there was a black superintendent and a white superintendent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know it seems so, so archaic to talk about that now in this context, but that's the way it was, that's how I grew up.  And yeah.
Speaker 1: All your teachers are black, all the students (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All my teachers were black, many of my teachers had Ph.D.'s, my English teacher Mr. Luck [ph.] was actually Dr. Luck, I mean there were, there were definitely, they were definitely well educated, our teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Dr. Luck one of your favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Yeah I learned English from him in a, in a significant way.  He, he taught--I, I like English, I like punctuation and (laughter) and trying to--my husband [Raymond H. Boone], my late husband was always about making sure that things were punctuated correctly.  And he always reminded me, I don't know if I ever told him but he always reminded me of my English teacher.  'Cause there was a precision to it all and I sort of liked that, I loved diagramming sentences, again pretty dorky, but yeah (laughter).
Story_ID: 669198
Speaker 1: So Dr. Luck [ph.] was one of your favorite teachers, and was there another English professor you were talking about just now that was--
Speaker 2: Her name escapes me right now.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, that's all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, so but you like to diagram sentences and all those kind of things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: Yeah I was much more of an English as opposed to a math person (laughter) so you know.
Speaker 1: Were, so were you a shy student?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah I kind of take it the way you describe yourself you were probably shy, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I am, I was (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right so--
Speaker 2: I have to work at not being shy.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, but I take it you're a good student when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was pretty good.
Story_ID: 669199
Speaker 1: And what your aspirations, you know for, for a career? Did you have role models or people that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah I did, I did, well you know, okay, so I graduated from high school [C.A. Johnson High School, Columbia, South Carolina] in 1960, and you know the Civil Rights Movement was beginning to take its shape.  And I was influenced by--really, it wasn't oppressive per se. I mean we had a happy and, and a full life.  Because we didn't know anything else other than our community, and our community was, there were lots of good things that happened within the community.  I mean we were friendly peop- you know, families got together blah, blah, blah.  But I knew that I wanted to do something, I knew I had to get out of Columbia [South Carolina], it was, I just knew that.  And--
Speaker 1: Well what, let, let's explore that for a second now what, what were the experiences, what was it like you say to go--'cause Waverly [Columbia, South Carolina] is like a I guess, black, all black.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You got all the professionals here and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm
Speaker 1: --you go to school, an all black school, but at some point you're going to have to go downtown, you're going have to interact with white people in terms of business and other things.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And so what was the, what was those, what were those interactions like in downtown Columbia?
Speaker 2: Actually they were not unpleasant, I mean, I never, neither did my mother [Helen Patterson], have a bad, to my knowledge, had a bad experience.  I have heard, for example, here we are in Richmond, Virginia where people could not--women could not try on clothes, if they were black.  They could not try on hats, if they were black.  That was not the case in my situation.  I don't know if others had--in the community had that.  My mother was treated with the utmost respect, and by, in turn so was I.  I remember I remember selling (laughter) advertising for our high school yearbook [Johnsonian], and I went to one particular store owner downtown.  And I was asking for the, for the sale and he said to me, "Where are you from, have you always lived here?"  And I said, "Yeah," I can remember having that conversation, yes, I did, I do, I did, I grew up here, I was born here.  And it was as if, because I spoke standard English that I had to be from somewhere else.  And that's, that has stuck with me un- to this day.  You now that, that kind of you, you can't be of the system that we're trying to es- keep you in (laughter) you know.  You, what happen to you, how did you get out of it, so but yeah the, the, I knew that I needed to get out of it.  So, but yeah the, the, I knew that I needed to get out, and so, and I had a cousin who, on my mother's side, who was a social worker.  And she lived in, in Ohio, and I would talk to her about what she did and I wasn't quite sure that I wanted to do it exactly the way she did.  But I knew, I would often say this, I want to make the biggest impact that I can in the world, that was, that was--what do you want to be?  I don't know, but I want to do something that will help as many people as possible.  I thought the one by one by one social work, casework kind of thing was not for me, that would take too long (laughter).  I had to do something that was gonna, and I, I didn't know macro and micro at that point in terms of sociological terms.  But I knew, I knew what I just said.
Story_ID: 669200
Speaker 1: You had mentioned the Civil Rights Movement, now was that something that was--I mean were you read- reading a lot about it or seeing it on--?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I was seeing it on tele- television, we had a television.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was, I was, I was reading about, we were talking about it in school.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think it's 1960 that the sit-in movement started in--
Speaker 2: Right.  And I went to Bennett College where--in North Carolina, Greensboro they had already started the, you know direct action by the time I got to Bennett.  And you know I wanted to participate.  Now you have to understand that that, that people of my mother's era were not so, they were afraid.  They were, my mother [Helen Patterson] said, "I sent you there to get a college education, not to get put in jail," so I had to be cognizant of that.  And while I participated, I participated in a way that I made sure that I didn't get arrested (laughter), so.  And, and that was the tension in the black community with people who were aspiring for college and the like.  The, the tension was do you get an edu- good education so you can walk through the door versus opening the door?  And, and the way it was often put, you have to be ready to walk through the door, so don't get involved in all of this.  Meaning--
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) direct action.
Story_ID: 669201
Speaker 1: Let me take you--in high school, now when you, you graduated in 1960, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah and--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --I was not--I mean there was no particular activity to participate in, in Columbia [South Carolina] in 1960.
Speaker 1: What--in terms of the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay all right that's what I, I--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But there was a graduation around (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You--there was a graduation from C.A., C.A. Johnson [C.A. Johnson High School, Columbia, South Carolina], but when you were graduating I mean, how did you chose Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina] how, how was the process?
Speaker 2: My best friends were going to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], mother [Helen Patterson] said, "You need to," she was pretty controlling now that I talk about it.  She said, "I think you should go somewhere where you'll meet new friends." Not that she didn't like my friends, she just felt that I should expand my universe.  And I--you know we all thought that single sex schools were cool, so that was--Bennett was the alternative at that point.  Though I got to say I thought about you know one of the Seven Sister schools, one of the, one of the, you know white single sex colleges in New England.  But that was, that was a, a, and again the fact that I thought about that, my mother felt that we couldn't afford it, which was probably the truth.  But we were taught to, or it was in our minds to, from school to think big and to think beyond you know your--the, the states around you.  But anyway, I went to Bennett and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started in the fall of 1960.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 669202
Speaker 1: Bennett [Bennett College] is in, in--
Speaker 2: Greensboro [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Greensboro, now this is exactly where the sit-ins--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --going on (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Right, right so I went to the belly of the beast so to speak.
Speaker 1: Right, so you--so were, were you part of that initial group at the, the sit-ins?
Speaker 2: No, I was friends with, but most of the, most of the people who were doing that were--who were in the civil rights activities, for example, sit-ins in, in at the Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company] and the like were guys, were boys.
Speaker 1: And they were from North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: They were from A and T.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Now I remember participating in, we had this, this process where we would try to go to a theatre, a movie theatre.  And it was a circle and we would, we would go to the ticket booth and, "May I purchase a ticket please?"  And the person would say, "No," we would move, I would move away, the next person.  And we had this continuous circle of you know, "May I buy a ticket please," and that was, that was the harassment, so to speak.  They didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They had to keep saying no to a line of black people--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So that was what I participated in, that was not worthy of being arrested so I kept, kept my faith with my mom [Helen Patterson].
Speaker 1: Okay now what would happen if your mother had--did you ever sp- like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh God only knows (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 669203
Speaker 1: Did you graduate from Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated from Dillard University in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Now--now what happened, what, what happened (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Why didn't--I hated Bennett, after a fashion.  Bennett was a finishing school, it was, it was all about, I mean one of my classes was Etiquette 101 and I don't know I just felt like I was wasting my time with you know soft classes.  And the only, the only real challenging professor that I had was a gentleman by the name of Dr. Berthette [ph.] and he was a history teacher.  And I loved history, but that was it, the rest of the courses were I, I was just bored.  And so my sister [Phyllis Patterson], keep in mind she's much older right?  So she had gotten married and her husband was the academic dean at Dillard University.  So my mom [Helen Patterson] said, "Okay if you wanna change schools, you have to go where your sister is," so that was New Orleans.  And I didn't really know how wonderful New Orleans (laughter) was but I said, "Okay, that's fine with me."  So I moved to New Orleans and I fin- went to, was accepted, I had to, I mean I didn't get any special privileges.  I had to go to summer school and you know really, really hunker down in order to graduate in four years.  Because that's all we had money for (laughter) was four years, no five, no fifth year (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.  So did you, did you stay at Bennett a full year?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I stayed at Bennett for, for two years.
Speaker 1: Now could you transfer credits?
Speaker 2: And I transfer- I transferred some credits, but like I said, there were some credits that were like, not basket weaving but Etiquette 101 which was not (laughter)--
Speaker 1: It couldn't transfer.
Speaker 2: Which was not transferable.
Speaker 1: That's something, that's interesting that's the first time I ever heard that. I hadn't heard a lot about Bennett, I hadn't heard a lot about it but that's--that's interesting.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So Dillard University now, what were they engaged in the Civil Rights Movement in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: Not, not really and, and I wasn't.  At that point I was, I was more into college life, and graduating.  And I had a really healthy and wonderful college life, I mean I--
Speaker 1: Did, did you join a sorority?
Speaker 2: I did not because again, that was gonna take too much of my time away from classes and I had a mission, and that was to graduate.
Story_ID: 669204
Speaker 1: And along the way my, a visiting professor came to Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], namely Lester Granger who was, who had retired as the National Urban League president or director.  And--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and he was my professor at and I adored him, he was so smart, I thought.  And he told such wonderful stories that taught, that taught a lesson, he helped to integrate the [U.S.] military through his role--role at the, at the Urban, National Urban League.  And just you know, just stories like that and how it happened, the strategies and whatever and--
Speaker 2: So he had a key role in the integration of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Military--
Speaker 2: --military around--during the Truman [President Harry S. Truman] administration?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Right--right after World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah and by the time I met him, as I said he was a retired person, but teaching at, at, at Dillard.  And so we, I told him I wanted to go to grad school and he asked me where did I wanna go?  And I said, "Either NYU [New York University, New York, New York] or Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]," and he said, "I think you should go to Boston," and I said, "Okay."  And--
Speaker 2: So what--what was your major when you graduated from Dillard?
Speaker 1: Sociology--anthropology.
Story_ID: 669205
Speaker 1: Did you intend to, to get a, a graduate degree in one of them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  My, again my mother [Helen Patterson] who's my guiding force said to me, "You know you need to be able to take care of yourself.  You need to be able to make a living and take care of yourself," and by then I had honed in on the fact that I wanted to go, I wanted to be a social worker, but I had understood that there was more to social work than just casework.  And so I was headed toward a degree in policy and community organization, community planning, that track, the macro track.  And so Dr. Granger [Lester Granger] helped me, well I applied and he wrote a recommendation and I'd like to think that, that was a pivotal factor.  I received fellowship, a fellowship to go to--to grad school, and it was a really good experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Boston [Massachusetts] is so unlike South Carolina and, and Louisiana.
Speaker 2: You're, you're absolutely right. It was frigid to begin with (laughter) and yeah and--
Speaker 1: So this is what, what year are we starting here?
Speaker 2: Six--
Speaker 1: You came out of Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] in?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 2: And I started BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] at in the, in September of '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So I went straight through, no stopping and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so Boston is cold and--
Speaker 2: Cold in many ways (laughter).  The, I was the only black person in, in my classes; it was mostly, mostly but not exclusively, Jewish.  And there were three of us who met in line registering: a young woman, a WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] as it used to be called (laughter), a white Anglo-Saxon, a Jewish girl and myself.  And we stood line long enough and decided that we wanted to be, we wanted to find an apartment together, and we did.  And we lived together for two years; it was more economical to do that (laughter) than anything else.  That was one of the best things that we all agreed that we did, because we learned about each other's culture--cultures.  And we were, we could help each other with you know our projects and the like, so it was a good experience.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, did, did you all have similar majors?
Speaker 2: Yes we were all social work makers--majors.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But in different tracks, some were psychiatrics--one was a psychiatric social worker, that was the track she was on, I can't remember what the other was.
Story_ID: 669206
Speaker 1: Now Boston [Massachusetts], this is 1964, now I didn't ask you about--now I know the assassination of John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was '63 [1963], that really kind of rocked the country, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah I was at, I was at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] at the time and I lived with my sister [Phyllis Patterson]--and her husband and family.  And they, they had a house on campus so that was very convenient.  I was right across from the library and right across from the boys dorm so couldn't have a better deal.  And I remember coming home from lunch and the story was breaking at that point about Kennedy, so yeah that rocked, that rocked the world (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah that was really--it was like an end of a, a vision in a lot of ways, like, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --just like, door was slammed on something that everybody was excited about.  The, the previous summer there was the bombing in Birmingham [at the 16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama], the March on Washington--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did, did anybody that you know go to the mark--march?
Speaker 2: Yeah there were people that went, I wanted to go but I didn't go so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You thought, did you, did you consider that your mother [Helen Patterson] might think about it or?
Speaker 2: I didn't have to consider, she (laughter) she was, she was very protective of me as I'm, as I'm listening to myself tell the story.  She was, she was pretty, pretty controlling about my safety, I mean you know it was, it was just.  I mean my sister had gone on with her life and it was just my mom and me, and you know she was, and I think the fact that she had lost a daughter you know made her, made her very protective.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 669207
Speaker 1: All right Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] in 1964, so--so what did you, what was your thesis about in, in Boston [Massachusetts]? I mean, or what kind of project did, did you have to do to get your master's [degree]?
Speaker 2: You know what, I'm gonna tell you I can't remember (laughter) because I can't remember and I'm not gonna make up something.  I know that it was, it had to do with, with mental health services in a suburban area of, of a suburb of Boston.  And we were able to do it as in a group, and once I finished my part of it, that was it, I, I cannot remember.  It was not a remarkable thesis (laughter), sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay and it, were there any faculty members or other people in, in Boston you, that you remember were significant in your?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, [HistoryMaker] Hubie Jones who ended up being--later becoming (background noise), becoming the dean of School of Social Work [Boston University School of Social Work, Boston, Massachusetts], I met [HistoryMaker] Dr. Alvin Poussaint who was just starting out his career.  I went to a lecture that he gave and--
Speaker 1: Now he--
Speaker 2: --ended up becoming friendly with him.  Oh, how can I forget.  Gosh, I cannot remember his name.  There was another person who was very involved in South, South End of Bal- of Boston and who was very influential.  Again I haven't thought about this in a while.
Speaker 1: A teacher?
Speaker 2: He was a community organizer and just became, I became enamored with his--his ability to make things happen.  Though--that was the hallmark of what I took away from Boston, strategies and policy considerations, and concepts about unintended consequences of, of policies.  You can think you're doing something that's really purposeful and good, and yet it can have a deleterious effect on, on the situation, that you hadn't even thought of.  And that was fascinating to me and I think to this day I think about ideas from that perspective of, okay if we, for example, do this, cover this, whatever.  And I, and right now I'm not, I have a managing editor so I don't make decisions about what goes in the newspaper [Richmond Free Press].  I may suggest, but I don't make the final decision.  And even before I make a de- a suggestion, I think about, well, what are the effects of that, and what are the unintended effects?  And that's one of those concepts that I remember from, from Boston.  I mean I'm sure there were others but that is utmost on my mind.
Story_ID: 669208
Speaker 1: What were some of the issues in Boston [Massachusetts] that people were organizing around?  Was housing an issue or--
Speaker 2: Housing and education, Louise Day Hicks was still alive and well and she was--and she was a monster as far as school desegregation was concerned.  Boston was a very segregated northern city, and it, it had as you may know lots of ethnic groups.  And the Irish, the Italians, the blacks lived here you know, blah, blah, blah and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Cape--Cape Verdeans and--um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right, right and so those issues were the, the ethnic clashes as it played out in schools was, was big.  And Louise Day Hicks was the, the icon for not having segre- for, for segregation, not desegregating schools.
Speaker 1: Right, right so did you interact much with the people in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], or?
Speaker 2: I did, as it--in so far as I was, I had a field placement in Roxbury, and, so yeah.  But it wasn't terribly remarkable, I mean I, I don't remember anything that was--
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: --significant.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now did you learn anything about, did you study community organizing?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah (clears throat) I worked at the United South End Settlements [Boston, Massachusetts] and we did organizing in, in the South End projects.  And you know I used to walk the streets of the South End of Boston at six o'clock at night and it was (laughter) it was dark.  And--there was no fear though, you know, it, you did what you had to do and, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you do door knocking and all that--okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah, yeah.  And I met some very interesting people I, first time I ever met (laughter), I know this sounds weird now, but I had never met anyone who was a lesbian.  I had never met people who were transsexual.  That's--I, those are the kind, I mean that was the kind of education I got just by the interactions that I had.  There was one woman who was, who was a lesbian and they were, the city or social services, whether it's state or city, was trying to remove her child from her and we ended up working, working that through so that she could keep her child.  So we had to work on policy issues as well as the individual's situation, so yeah.
Story_ID: 669209
Speaker 1: The organizer you were trying to mention before, when we were up last time, was Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King], right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And he was the head of what now, the?
Speaker 2: United South End Settlements [Boston, Massachusetts] at the, at that time, and he was a huge, huge influence he was, I can't believe I couldn't remember his name a few minutes ago.  But he was an organizer with a purpose, he, he helped families but he also af- influenced the larger systems that affected the families.  And that was right where I wanted to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so now you were in, at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] from, what, from--
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964] to--
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964] to--
Speaker 2: --to sixty- 1966, I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 669210
Speaker 1: So, a two year program now, now did you stay in Boston [Massachusetts] after you graduated?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't stay in Boston in the summers either; I worked at the Nat- at the Washington Urban League [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.] the first summer, with [HistoryMaker] Sterling Tucker who was then a, the executive director and again, my guardian angel, Dr., Dr. Granger [Lester Granger] helped me to get that, that internship.  And so I was in, in the Washington [D.C.] in '64 [1964] when all the civil rights legislation was being debated and passed [Civil Rights Act of 1964].
Speaker 1: Now we've interviewed, we interviewed Sterling Tucker back in 2002 [sic. 2004].
Speaker 2: Ah.
Speaker 1: And I know he ran for mayor and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --he was one of the big leaders there in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Washington.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's where I met my husband [Raymond H. Boone] actually (laughter).
Speaker 1: Really, in Washington--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --while you were still in Boston U [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 669211
Speaker 1: Well tell us how you met him.
Speaker 2: Well I was working for Sterling, Mr. Tucker [HistoryMaker Sterling Tucker], and he had given a speech, and my husband was working for the Afro-American Newspaper [Afro-American Newspapers] as a civil rights reporter.  At that point the Afro had thirteen separate editions and he was covering civil rights that would be covered in all of the, in, in all of the editions.  So whatever Sterling had said he wanted to follow up on, and call the office, Mr. Tucker said, "I don't have time," (laughter), "to talk to that reporter."  So he said, so I told him I said, "I'm sorry he's unavailable," and thirty minutes later, Ray Boone [Raymond H. Boone] called back again.  And I told him that he wasn't available, third time, I said, "Look he's not gonna talk to you, you're gonna have to talk to me."  And he said, "Who are you?" I gave him my name, and I said, he said, "What do you do?" I said, "I'm an intern," he said, "Okay bye."  He hung up, so (laughter) the next day he called back and apologized for being rude, but--and said, "Well can I meet you?"  And I said, "Yeah you can take me to lunch," and the joke in our family was that I was always hungry and always wanting to go to lunch.  But (laughter) I, he said, "I don't eat lunch," so I said, "Well, your loss."  So was that.  And then a woman in the office was giving a party and she said, "Why don't you invite that young man from the Afro?" So I sa- she told me to come and invite a friend if I wanted to.  And I said, "Well I really don't know anybody besides the people I work with," so she said invite him, I did, he came.  And he said, "Ray Boone couldn't come but I came in his place," (laughter), should've known (laughter) so I said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now had you ever seen him before?
Speaker 2: I had never seen him.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And he'd never seen you either, right?
Speaker 2: And he'd never seen me, I knew his voice, I knew it was he.  And some- someone had pointed me out to him so therefore, he knew who I was.  And he didn't, he physically did not appear as I had envisioned him, I mean he worked for the Afro, (background noise) was a black man, so I thought, and he, he was.  But--
Speaker 1: So what did you think he'd look, I mean what, what did you think he'd look like without--before you met him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well he--definitely Asian but I couldn't fig- but again--
Speaker 1: So, so you, so okay so oh it's confusing, but I just wanted to make, make sure we, we know that, now Ray Boone looked Asian, you said?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and--but you have to understand, growing up in South Carolina, black people looked all kinds of ways.  I mean we were not monolithic in our physical appearance, so that someone was blond for example and blue eyed, and still black, identified black was not at all unusual.  So his physical appearance didn't throw me it was just, "Oh, okay so that's who you are."  Never thought another minute about it and, I don't know, one thing led to another and we starting dating.  And I went back to school and stayed in, you know we stayed in touch, I think I came--he then was assigned to become editor of the Richmond Afro-American newspaper.  So I would come, I came down to Richmond [Virginia] a couple of times to see him and then the next summer I again worked in Washington [D.C.].  But he was here and we would meet in Washington, and (laughter) after, after graduating, I mean we had decided we were gonna get married.  And my mother [Helen Patterson] came for my graduation, he came for my graduation, he had graduated from Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], but several years prior to me.  And so it was kind of, that was kind of unusual and so yeah we, we were on campus and my mother said to him, "There's a chapel, why don't you guys go get married, now?"  I was so embarrassed, so embarrassed.  She was, she wanted to, I think not have any more responsibility (laughter) for like, this person, her daughter.  So anyway we, we had planned to get married in July, we got married July 11, 1966, and we were married until he passed away in June of 2014.
Story_ID: 669212
Speaker 1: I have a note here that you worked for--as the associate director of the Richmond Urban League [Urban League of Greater Richmond, Richmond, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --next, so you moved to Richmond [Virginia] after you got married [to Raymond H. Boone], right, is that?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had gotten a fellowship for one year from the National Urban League and back in those days, if you received a fellowship you had to work for the Urban League for every year that they gave you a fellowship.  Which was (laughter) at the time, I thought was a little onerous, but in retrospect that was a really good deal.  Because you were assured of a, of a job, you may not--of a position, you may not have--I was lucky that there was one, a position open here in Richmond where I wanted to come, so it all worked out.
Speaker 1: Okay so, so you worked for the Urban League, can you tell us about the year you worked for the Urban League in, in Richmond, what was it like?
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I worked on housing issues and public housing was, was run by a very harsh regime headed up by a man by the name of Frederic Fay.  And, such policies as, if you had a child--if a mother, a single mother had a child out of wedlock when she was, when she was living in public housing, and she had a second child, she had to move.  It was penalty on children as opposed to penalty on the mother.  And I mean it, certainly it was penalty on the mother too but it was, it was horrible, and so I was able to get a, we brought suit against the, the housing authority.  And that regulation or policy was, was removed, we worked on other issues; Model Cities was a federal program that was in Richmond.  I worked, worked on that, the community action program, the poverty program, was up in and alive.  Worked in coalition with other groups to bring about certain changes, we worked on education issues and we worked on issues related to a very blighted community known as Fulton [Fulton Hill, Richmond, Virginia].  And we helped to change, we helped to get rid of the blight in Fulton, we weren't so thrill- it, those kinds of projects take a very long time.  And the final product was not as, meaning how the community turned out in terms of rehabilitation wasn't exactly what we had planned.  But it was better than what it was. So, yeah we worked on those kind of issues.
Story_ID: 669213
Speaker 1: This is 1966, and so at the end of the year working with the Richmond Urban League [Urban League of Greater Richmond, Richmond, Virginia], what did you do next?
Speaker 2: I went to teaching (clears throat) at Virginia--at VCU.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Virginia Commonwealth University [Richmond, Virginia] which that year was Richmond Professional Institute, it changed to Virginia Commonwealth University where the medical school [Medical College of Virginia] and the, and the academic campus became one, i.e. VCU, Virginia Commonwealth.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and so did you, you taught sociology?
Speaker 2: I taught in the school of social work there.  I taught (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, social work.
Speaker 2: Yeah I taught social policy, social welfare, all the government programs were we, we taught them.  We taught about them and helped the students to understand the theories that were, that guided those programs.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is 1967, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967], sixty- I think I, I worked at the Urban League for more than one year. I went to VCU in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my, my daughter [Regina Boone], my first born was born while I was teaching there. She was born in 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now '68 [1968] was, was there like a riot or anything in Richmond [Virginia] in '68 [1968] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: I don't recall there being a riot, no.
Speaker 1: I know we had like a horrible riot in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and then Baltimore [Maryland], you know.
Speaker 2: Detroit [Michigan] yeah, yeah.  No Richmond, Richmonders tend to be less provoked than others.  It is remarkable now when certain things happen vis-a-vis police brutality and the like that there are demonstrations in this community.  They're driven by students at VCU. VCU is a very important force for social protest, and that's what drives it now.  There was no student movement, Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] students to some extent were involved prior to VCU becoming the powerhouse that it is, but now it's driven by VCU in my opinion, in my observation.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and then students from Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], they're like twenty miles away, right, so they're not really--
Speaker 2: Yeah more like--yeah more than twenty miles away and they, they don't really have an influence here in that regard, as I see it, yeah.
Story_ID: 669214
Speaker 1: Now in the early days did you have any interactions with the newspa- paper at all when you, after you were first married?
Speaker 2: Only to the extent to say, "I don't work for the newspaper, you'll have to call him directly," (laughter). There were so many people who wanted to get to Ray [Raymond H. Boone] through me but--
Speaker 1: So those early days he was representing, he was the editor of the Richmond (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was the editor of the Richmond Afro-American newspaper.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was, there were several editions of Afro-American right, a Washington edition [Washington Afro-American], a Baltimore [Baltimore Afro-American]--
Speaker 2: Thirteen separate editions, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So this is a more than just one black paper. It's a little empire of them, in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was the black voice in Richmond [Virginia], there was no other and he, he was--he had a mission and he was dominant in his, I mean he was very outspoken.  People either liked him or--they loved him or they hated him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a--he filled the room (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right so he took positions.  What, what were his positions about for the most part?
Speaker 2: Anything from how the governor at the time referred to black people, there was a, there was a governor, Mills Godwin who would call black people Negras and he asked him at press conference if he could say hero?  And, "If you can say hero, governor you can say Negro," those kinds of symbolic things as well as other issues.  He was involved with the redistricting of Richmond, meaning there were at large city council people.  You had to run if you wanted to be on city council [Richmond City Council] you had to run citywide, and that was damn near impossible for a black person to win.  And then the, the city was becoming, as some political group--white political groups thought, too--too black.  So they annexed an area of a county, Chesterfield County [Virginia] which ironically I now live in the annexed area (laughter).  And that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So is that now black mostly or is it--
Speaker 2: Yeah it is, it is (laughter) which is so amazingly interesting.  So--the single member district system was, I mean it went through the courts of course.  And out of that whole process, we got our first black mayor, Henry Marsh [HistoryMaker Henry L. Marsh, III], and we have people running in each of nine districts.  And people win.  This, I mean there's a, it's a fair much, much fairer system.  We just changed to a, at large strong mayor form of government, and a black person [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder] won.  The way it worked it, I think they have to win five of nine districts and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --this person won.
Speaker 1: Well I--getting back to, so the, the newspaper had a political impact on the--on the community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very much so, very much so.
Speaker 1: And, and I wanna point out that we have interviewed some people who were part of the Norfolk 17 and people that talk about the suit of Barbara Johns.  And I mean there's, there's a lot of civil rights struggle going on in Virginia, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Virginia was a hotbed.  Virginia in many ways was far more politicized than, than I experienced South Carolina to be.  Now maybe it was my age and, and you know just not my eyes weren't wide open.  I mean I know names like Modjeska Simkins [Modjeska Monteith Simkins] who was, she was always a, a driving force, but beyond--but Richmond to me just was so politically driven and it was such a wonderful place to be actually.
Speaker 1: The governor who would, of course reside here in Richmond, the governor of Virginia [J. Lindsay Almond] closed all the Virginia public schools to avoid desegregation back in what '57 [1957].  I think--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --or '56 [1956], '57 [sic. 1958].
Speaker 2: Yeah that, yeah and our next door neighbor, this, this, this, this newspaper's office is situated next door to the daily paper in Richmond, Richmond Times-Dispatch, which was the mouthpiece for that whole--
Speaker 1: For segregation.
Speaker 2: For segregation and closing down the schools.
Speaker 1: Okay so this--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) is a battle and so, so you're teaching at, at Virginia Commonwealth [Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia] and then, did you teach at the University of--of Richmond [University of Richmond, Richmond, Virginia] too?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 669215
Speaker 1: You all moved back to Bal- moved to Baltimore [Maryland], right?
Speaker 2: We moved to Baltimore (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what, what year was that?
Speaker 2: That would've been '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977], '78 [1978], I think it was September of '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because Ray [Boone's husband, Raymond H. Boone] was promoted to be vice president of the Afro-American chain [Afro-American Newspapers] for editorial content, so he was again responsible for at that point, they still had--there was still thirteen separate editions.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, but Baltimore was the, was that the headquarters of the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Afro-American.
Speaker 2: Right, the--
Speaker 1: The Murphy family.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: We've interviewed many of them, it was still--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is heyday of the Afro so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so he's moving, you moved to Baltimore in '77 [1977] and there you get a job was it the housing group, the Baltimore Blueprint or was it?
Speaker 2: Baltimore Blueprint, yeah.  Baltimore Blueprint was, was much more than housing, it was a federal and sta- federal state and city partnership.  That was it was almost a dream job for someone who had the interest and inclination that I had.  It was designed to look at policies at the city level that were affected by the state and federal governments.  And to make changes where, where, where appropriate in seven different systems, housing, social services, juvenile services, education, and the like--seven systems.  And the way we did it, it well first of all the money came from the state and federal government so there was buy--and city.  And so there was buy in at three diff- three separate levels and we had what we call policy teams that worked on the issues that they decided through consensus and for example, in education this is an easy one to illustrate.  There were--the federal lunch program [National School Lunch Program] and students who at the, at, where the rubber meets the road, students were who received free and reduced lunches had a different system for paying for their lunches.  Or showing that they deserved their lunches through this program and it, it stigmatized them.  Here I am I need a, you know I'm getting a free lunch and the person behind me is not, so they know what my economic status is.  And we changed the process wherein we had student IDs and they simply read the, there was a reader.  And they simply read it and it, it registered whether the student was a free and reduced or not a free and reduced.  So everybody's card get re- got read, nobody knew in front of you or behind you whether you were of a student like that.  Simple kind of thing you may say, but important to the whole process of students feeling equal.  We also did, we got a block of houses that were, that were, had been deeded to the city or the city owned them.  Because they were without, they had not paid taxes so the city owned the houses.  We took a block of row houses; you have to understand that Baltimore, its architecture for many homes was row hou- row houses.  We took a block, got the systems, meaning heating, electrical, et cetera repaired.  And sold those houses for the cost of getting the basic systems up to par so in many instances, we're talking about twelve thousand [dollars], fifteen thousand at that time, maybe twenty max.  Got, they got three, they got 3 percent loans to be able to move into the houses.  And they were then taught, the new owners were then taught how to, how to do drywall and paint and other things of that sort, so they owned a house for fifteen thousand plus sweat equity.  Those were the kind of issues that we dealt with.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, this is Baltimore Blueprint?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is a--one of the initiatives of, of the Schaefer [William Donald Schaefer]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --administration.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 669216
Speaker 1: How long did you work for Baltimore Blueprint?
Speaker 2: Worked for Baltimore Blueprint for, I think it was four, four and a half years.
Speaker 1: Okay so 1981 or so, you--is when you left (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm, Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] came into (laughter) and he pulled the federal money.
Speaker 1: Okay so, I know you worked for the Baltimore Symphony [Baltimore Symphony Orchestra] too, but did that happen next?
Speaker 2: No I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you work in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I commuted (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's only fifty miles but depending on the time of day it can take anywhere from forty minutes to two hou-, four hours to get there--
Speaker 2: Yeah it was about forty miles--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and what's true is that I, I did the, what I call the reverse commute, because I was going into D.C. from, from Baltimore [Maryland].  And I don't know it just, it wasn't, it wasn't terribly onerous in terms of driving, I did, I took, I took the commuter tra- there was a commuter train.  I took the train sometimes, sometimes I drove, but as my children got to be, as my son [Raymond H. Boone, Jr.] got to be in middle school or near middle school, I left.  Because I needed to be closer to home, and by that time my husband [Raymond H. Boone] had left the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers], and was teaching at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  So we were both out of the city, and I felt that was not a good thing.  So that's when I came back to Richmond [Virginia], did some work, I mean excuse me to Baltimore, did some work for National League of Cities as a consultant.  And then finally worked for the Baltimore Symphony to help them address their issues of, of lack of inclusion.  And it wa-, again it was, it was like a community organizing (laughter) job.  Because I had to help, help them make way for a more inclusive symphony community.
Speaker 1: And now what year did you start with the Baltimore Symphony?
Speaker 2: I guess that would've been '90 [1990], I mean excuse me, eighty--
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine [1989], does that sound about right?
Speaker 2: Yeah somewhere like that, yeah '89 [1989].
Speaker 1: Okay 'cause you were at the Children's Defense Fund it says from '81 [1981] to '89 [1989].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So that sounds like--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1989.
Story_ID: 669217
Speaker 1: All right.  So I, I don't wanna skip completely past the Children's Defense Fund so, it's been mentioned at least four times this week, other people that--judges we've interviewed they mentioned they, they worked for Children's Defense Fund or lawyers we've interviewed every--yeah at least four different people have mentioned it, so this is founded by [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and so you were there what, for--about seven, seven or eight years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah so, so you were the director of state and local affairs?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: For the?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, well when, when Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] became president, a, a lot of the activity politically was at the state level in terms of legislation funding for poor families.  And so the process that the Children's Defense Fund used was to select a few states to work in.  To improve healthcare and daycare conditions for, for poor and working families.  And so I worked in, in Virginia a little bit because I knew Virginia, and also in Texas.  We worked on child health issues, funding for child health.  All, all of our issues were really about getting the funding for programs.  And, let's see, where--and Florida to some extent, so yeah.
Speaker 1: So you had to do a lot of traveling?
Speaker 2: I did a lot of travel- traveling. I also, when Marian could not make an event, to do a, a speech I was called upon to do it as long as it wasn't you know, before [U.S.] Congress (laughter).  I did a lot of the--the speaking in the--at the state and local level.
Story_ID: 669218
Speaker 1: Yeah so this is eight, eight years.  So the Baltimore Symphony [Baltimore Symphony Orchestra] now, you're the manager of community affairs and marketing for the Baltimore Symphony.  Now what was--I mean I don't know if many symphonies worry about you know, you know--
Speaker 2: Inclusion?
Speaker 1: Yeah right, so how did this come about, and--yeah, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well how did that come about?  Well, it actually came about because the symphony received significant funding from the State of Maryland.  And a gentleman who passed away, whose name is, was Pete Rawlings [HistoryMaker Howard "Pete" Rawlings] was on the Appropriations Committee [of the Maryland House of Delegates].  If you recognize the last name, his daughter [Stephanie Rawlings Blake] is the outgoing mayor of Baltimore [Maryland].  But Pete was very concerned that the money was coming from taxpayers.  But the symphony was essentially lily white, and he felt that that was not right, and indeed it wasn't.  And so they decided to hire someone to deal with that issue, and I was selected.  I had minimal knowledge of symphonic music, but I had, I had a lot of interest in inclusion and knowledge of how to get basically middle class people and not so middle class people into the symphony hall [Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, Baltimore, Maryland] and to feel comfortable.  And I always said to myself when I went there, that I never wanted to get so comfortable there that I forgot what it was to be uncomfortable in a new situation.  Because that's the way the people would be feeling that I was trying to bring in.  We had a committee; a cross section of Baltimoreans who you know, advised and came up with programs.  And then I sought to implement them and we had, you know we had all Baltimore--we had one that I was particularly proud of.  It's called the All-Baltimore Concert, and what that did was, we did was we found twelve non-profit organizations.  We asked, we gave them tickets to sell to the symphony, they sold them, we gave them the tickets at five dollars, and they sold them for ten.  They kept the five and they got their constituents into this, into the symphony.  So when you looked at the audience, it was a very cross--very much a cross section of Baltimore.  Organizations such as Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] as well as you know a church organization.  You know you name it, so the, the, the, the visual, the optics were all Baltimore and it was a wonderful concert that people enjoyed.  We had African American composers on the program; we had African American performers on the program.  And it, it, it worked and I mean that's an example we, once we had the Boys Choir of Harlem come and perform.  And then we had kids from the community to come and have dinner with them after the concert, again making people feel comfortable in the symphony hall.
Story_ID: 669219
Speaker 1: Yeah Boys Choir of Harlem, I know they were extremely popular after the movie 'Glory' came out 'cause they did the singing for that--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that final rush to the parapet in the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the Battle of Fort Wagner, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that, that song, I, it's a classical piece that they play, it's, it's become popular, so popular now they play it at the beginning of the, no the Cavaliers [Cleveland Cavaliers] play it at the beginning of the NBA [National Basketball Association] games.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Hums) You know like (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The players come out to, to the Boys Choir of Harlem doing this, what is this, I can't think of the name of the song, I used to know it but--
Speaker 2: Sorry can't help you.
Speaker 1: Or the piece rather, symphonic piece.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That the boys choir sang, I know '60 Minutes' covered the boys choir in those days, the director [HistoryMaker Walter J. Turnbull] and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --all that, yeah it was a big, you know.  So symphonies all over the country wasn't, I know it wasn't just Baltimore [Baltimore Symphony Orchestra], but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No Detroit [Detroit Symphony Orchestra] was one of those--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --as well--
Speaker 1: DSO, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and, as a matter of fact (laughter) I was slated to go to Detroit [Michigan] and help them do some organizing that would put them in a--I mean Baltimore was written up in The Christian Science Monitor and The New York Times actually for the kind, the wide variety of programs that, that we gave rise to.  And I was asked to go to Detroit to consult with them, but by the time they had asked me, I was (laughter) involved with the newspaper [Richmond Free Press] here.  With--having started it with my husband [Raymond H. Boone], so I had to decline but that, that was a, that was a very enjoyable part of my career.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Yeah that's, you know, it's an extension of I guess the, the, you know symphonies have in this country have periodically tried to you know put the product out to the general public.  To create more symphonic fans 'cause you can't--you couldn't just depend on a small group of--even though they be rich (laughter)--fans of the symphony.
Speaker 2: Well I--yeah, Richmond [Richmond Symphony] hasn't quite gotten that memo yet, but (laughter) yeah symphonies are getting older and greyer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Symphony audiences at least, yes.
Story_ID: 669220
Speaker 1: So you were at the Boston, I mean the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra from '89 [1989] until, when?
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 1: To '91 [1991], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually November of '91 [1991] I moved, I started coming to Richmond [Virginia] to help my husband (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Now and your hus- your husband had moved to Richmond before you moved?
Speaker 2: Well he hadn't moved he here, he was, he was spending weekdays here and coming back home on the, on the weekend.  He was you know doing all the necessary groundwork to get the newspapers started.
Speaker 1: To start the Richmond Free Press, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now this is now is a good time I guess to turn to his story--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and try to catch up where it was listed on his story.  Now he was--now where was Raymond Boone [Raymond H. Boone] from, where was he born and where, and?
Speaker 2: He was born in, in Nansemond County, Virginia; Suffolk, Virginia was part of Nansemond County.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what, what year was he born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-eight [1938].
Speaker 1: Okay, in 1938, all right, and tell, just kind of summarize his, what you know about his upbringing and, and his career up to this point when he starts the paper.
Speaker 2: Okay so Ray was born as I said in, in Suffolk, he was, his mother [Leathia Boone] was Native American and African American.  His father was Japanese, his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now on that point I just wanna, to just cite that in today's edition as we said earlier today, December 9, 2016, the Richmond Free Press has a editorial about your late husband's father, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who was a Japanese man named, could you--can you pronounce it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Miyazaki [Tsujiro Miyazaki] was the last name.
Speaker 1: Okay all right, all right.  And, and now how did this, this is unusual you know in this coun- country.
Speaker 2: Quite unusual, I would think.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: As, as best I know the story and let me caveat this by saying that for many, I was, my husband told me this of course as we were getting to know each other and sharing our secrets and our, you know, life story as we were about to get married.  He told me who his father was and the circumstances.  As he knew it, his father was a stowaway from Japan.  I've heard some say that he came to the West Coast and then made his way to the East Coast.  The way my husband told it was that he came to, to Norfolk [Virginia] which is a port, and somehow made it to Suffolk, Virginia which is about forty miles or less from, from Norfolk.  He had to be quite my, would be father in law would've been quite an adventurous person.  Because to leave family, to leave family in Japan and come to the United States was, was pretty remarkable.
Speaker 1: Now I don't know, because I've heard at least three other stories--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --a Malaysian, a native of Somaliland and was one other that I think from Madagascar--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --became as part of [U.S.] Merchant Marine to ports in New Orleans [Louisiana], one came to New Orleans, one to Mobile [Alabama] another one--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, out to the--New York [New York], and missed their ship you know and each case the pe- the person either missed their ship or--and, and looked for the black commu- community of people who look like them.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that's, that was, I don't know if that's his story in this but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know 'cause there, this is a racist country, as we--
Speaker 2: Very.
Speaker 1: --we--so, white people are not gonna accept you if you're not white and so these men, each case, I mean there was a woman that did, she works for the water department.  She was head of the water department in New York [sic.]; she used to be in the Jet ads for Raveen hair, beautiful hair (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --her, her daddy was a Malaysian that that happened to, he, he went right to Harlem [New York, New York], he was trying to find some brown people.
Speaker 2: Found, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's how they ended up there and so that, Ayesha [HistoryMaker Bernyce Ayesha Hassan-Fletcher], she just passed away last year, she was married to the fella they call the father of affirmative action, Fletcher.
Speaker 2: Oh yes--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Art Fletcher [HistoryMaker Arthur Fletcher]?
Speaker 1: Art Fletcher's wife.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Her father was from East Africa and his name was Hassan [Salam Hassan] or something and he, he was similarly stranded in New York.  And that's how she got the name Ayesha. That was her given name, it wasn't because of the Black Power movement and people trying to recoup their names, she already had it, you know.
Speaker 2: Got you.
Speaker 1: So this is, so I am just laying the groundwork--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for this.
Story_ID: 669221
Speaker 1: I don't know quite how he [Boone's father in law, Tsujiro Miyazaki] got to, to Suffolk [Virginia] but he did, and what's even more remarkable is that he opened a business, which was called the Horseshoe Cafe [Suffolk, Virginia] (laughter).  And he served a, I'm sure he served more than just one, one fare, but he served something called yak and yaka mein.  And I later learned actually from my daughter [Regina Boone] who spent three years in Japan after she finished college, and yak in Japanese means--had something to do with noodles.  And I don't wanna say it means noodles 'cause I'm, I'm not proficient, but in the language, but at any rate, he served that and it was a huge success.  And, and the restaurant was a huge success as I understand it, and to this day there are people in Suffolk who still make yak 'cause they learned it from him, or imitated him.  So, he was there, my husband's mother [Leathia Boone] I think worked with and for him, and sh- and that's who they met.  And they had a, a child him, Raymond [Raymond H. Boone] and then they had another child, Gerald [ph.], so it was Raymond and Gerald.  What happened in the '40s [1940s] when the internment camps, the white peop- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah during World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: World War II.
Speaker 2: The Japanese Americans were considered the enemy--
Speaker 1: The enemy.
Speaker 2: --or potential enemies by the U.S. government and were rounded up.
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: That's I just want to make sure people know that--
Speaker 1: Yes that, that's--and the relevance to today of course is that the President-elect Trump [President Donald John Trump] is saying he wishes to do something very similar to people of Muslim faith.  And it was a very scary time then and it's even more scary for people who are Muslims in America now.  So that's the relevance and that's the editorial slant if you will, or reason for the editorial in this week's edition of the Free Press [Richmond Free Press].  At any rate, what I know is and what my husband told me is that white people pointed him out; they were the ones who outed him in Suffolk.  And he was taken to Arkansas, there were two internment camps there, he went to one and then another.  And he wrote letters back, we have letters that he wrote asking about the boys, being concerned about people.  Being concerned about his, his business in the, the inventory from the business, a relative of, and keep in mind my, my husband was a young child at, at the time.  So he, what he knows is what you know what his elders told him in later years.  He has the, the photographs that's in the Free Press this week is one that the owned.  I think his mother gave it to him, his brother who he, he passed away in the, in the mid--mid to late--he passed away late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], of a heart condition, he was young.  And my husband never, you have to understand, I am telling his story because my husband was, I'm not sure what the right word is, embarrassed or uncomfortable with telling the story of who, who he was, of, yeah.
Story_ID: 669222
Speaker 1: Well it's--it's a odd ancestry in the United States, and the whole--and if he, he didn't say anything I mean if there, there are so many African Americans that look, look like him.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: That didn't--you know but I, another person we interviewed was Judge, Judge Russell Sugarmon [HistoryMaker Russell B. Sugarmon] who's a part of the Civil Rights Movement in Memphis [Tennessee], his father [sic. grandfather] is Chinese.  There's a picture of him; he has a picture of him you know so I mean--
Speaker 2: But he identified as black, yeah of course (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There's really almost no choice.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  And, parenthetically, though, when we went to get our marriage license in Columbia [South Carolina], the clerk asked my husband [Raymond H. Boone], "What nationality are you?"  And I found that so off putting, you know, 'cause by that time, I mean you know I--it, it wasn't top of mind that he was anything but black.  But she saw him as something other than black, and so yeah the (laughter) the whole, that whole thing was--see there were two things that were going on; first of all he was the product of this union.  And because Japanese Americans were viewed by the larger community as white, he was, his mother [Leathia Boone] and father [Tsujiro Miyazaki] were not allowed to get married.  See the Loving case [Loving v. Virginia, 1967] didn't happen until several years later.
Speaker 1: Well wouldn't it just rest on the fact that interracial marriage was not allowed in Virginia, so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so any races, any two races, if they're perceived as races they can't get married (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly, and that was the, that was the, the shame, if you will or the reluctance to own who his parents were, because they couldn't get married.  And to get married, to be the product of, of a situation that was not a union of marriage was not acceptable.  That was not, that just wasn't acceptable, and so he never talked about it, he never talked about it.  He talked it to me once or twice or three times, and my daughter [Regina Boone] being exceedingly inquisitive would ask questions and ask questions.  And then when she got a chance to go to Japan to teach English after she finished college, she tried to do what research she could in Japan.  Most of the research that has been done that has been useful to our family was, has been through her efforts.  We have a cousin on my husband's side who is a historian who has done some, a lot of research on the whole area of Suffolk, Virginia.  And the free issue, I don't know if you've heard that term or not, but there are people in that area who were never slaves.  And they're very proud.  The, the Boones, the Faulks, the Skeeters, the Milteers, those are all surnames that have, that have a history of not having people in their family who were slaves.
Speaker 1: Well not for a long time anyway, I think if you go all the way back you'll find somebody (laughter) but--
Speaker 2: Yeah well--
Speaker 1: --but they, they, free issue being, I mean the law was in those days in the South if your, your mother is free then the baby will be free, is born free.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: If the mother's a slave the baby's a slave, didn't matter what the complexion is or whatever.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: If the mother is free from by--however she's free, then the issue is free.
Speaker 2: Got you.
Speaker 1: And you know it goes like that, like that, but if, if say a free man, free man of color had a wo- a baby with a woman who's a slave, the baby was a slave.  You know so it's a--and you know if it's a--
Speaker 2: So the mother was the--
Speaker 1: So in those lines of people probably there's, no one ever got with someone--with a woman who was enslaved and, and that way they could make sure nobody in their family was enslaved you know--
Speaker 2: Got you.
Speaker 1: --going forward, but they probably started off at some point with, that's how we came here, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah exactly.  So anyway the, the, the history is sketchy but it's, it's, it's enough of a, it's, it's rounded off enough to be able to tell a coherent story with, with lots of holes in it, but nonetheless a coherent story.
Story_ID: 669223
Speaker 1: Yeah I can't think of her name but Paula [HistoryMaker Paula Madison], her, I can't think of the last name, but she's the owner of the Los Angeles Sparks, that just won the NBA [sic. Women's National Basketball Association] championship.  Her, she has Chinese ancestors and actually went to China and discovered relatives.  She had a, she talked about if for about half hour during her interview.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: But so there are people and you'd be surprised that, Aki Aleong [HistoryMaker Aki Leonard Gonzales Aleong] who we interviewed also as an African American is maybe one eighth African American.  Which is not unusual in this set of interviews.  But his, his great-grandfather was, was Chinese.  No, no his, I'm sorry his father [Henry Aleong] was Chinese, his father was Chinese, his mother [Agnes Gonsalves Aleong] was Trinidadian but a mix of a lot of the people who lived in Trinidad.
Speaker 2: Got you.
Speaker 1: Including the Africans, so, but he plays Vietnamese movie characters in Hollywood (laughter), Aki Aleong.
Speaker 2: Wow, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is a, I just, I threw all these out so anybody watching this knows that there, this is not--
Speaker 2: This is not terribly unique.
Speaker 1: It's not singular but it is, but it is different, it's really different but it's--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, there are other people that have similar backgrounds in the, you know in the collection, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Mervyn Dymally's father [Hamid Dymally] was East Indian, the congressman from Compton, California, who we interviewed.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was born in Trinidad.
Story_ID: 669224
Speaker 1: There's something happen--now what happens to his father [Boone's father in law, Tsujiro Miyazaki] in the internment camp, we were in the internment camp?
Speaker 2: No one's not, no one truly knows, he either, he either died there--and that's actually where we're trying to find some, some answers.  My daughter [Regina Boone] just applied for a fellowship to, to study and to--she's a photographer, but she wants to document through, through photographs, the camps, what's left and so forth, so we're trying to figure that out.  But he either died or was sent to Japan, but there were, as I said there were letters, and then they stopped, so.
Speaker 1: I know Japanese Americans keep relics of those camps, posters of the internment--
Speaker 2: Right, and there's a, there's a museum that was started in I think in 19--in the 1990s, mid, mid to late 1990s.  So you know there's a, there's enough to, there's enough there to, to be able to research and see how far back we can go.  And there's a cousin on my husband's side who's a hi- who is a historian--
Speaker 1: Now what is his name?  You mentioned him before.
Speaker 2: Gosh.  I'm sorry I cannot remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Well we'll just take note of him.
Speaker 2: I just, we just met him very, very recently, he is--but he hopes to be teaching at, at VCU [Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia] next semester, I mean next school year.  But he's done a lot of research on the families in the Suffolk-Nansemond County [Virginia] area.  Because it is, there's so much intermarriage and so much rich history of these, of, of Native Americans, blacks and whomever.  I think that my husband's grandfather was Native American, because all that my husband [Raymond H. Boone] remembers him doing was trapping mink.  Now I said to him, "How many black people do you know that trapped mink?  Your grandfather was, was Native American," and you know he did- he didn't, he didn't seem to think about those kind of things very analytically.  It just, he accepted it for what it was and I would always say, "But don't you think?"  And he'd say, "Yeah well maybe so," (laughter) you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But move on.  He didn't wanna dwell on that.
Story_ID: 669225
Speaker 1: So Ray Boone [Raymond H. Boone], he's, he's raised by the mother [Leathia Boone] I suppose, right?
Speaker 2: He was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) After his father [Tsujiro Miyazaki] never comes back from internment?
Speaker 2: Yeah actually he was raised by his aunt his, his, his mother's sister, and yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and he's--now they had no, he had no inheritance from his father or I suppose probably the government probably confiscated--
Speaker 2: He conf- they con--
Speaker 1: --his business [Horseshoe Cafe, Suffolk, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, and if there was any reparations he chose not to go down that path.
Speaker 1: Reparations for the Japanese who were interned until the 1980s I believe.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I think they got twenty thousand [dollars] a piece or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah or whatever and whenever he, he chose not to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.  So but he, so he's raised in, is he raised in Suffolk [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: He's raised in Suffolk; he would spend summers in, in New York [New York] with his, with another aunt and uncle.  And so they, they helped him to have a, you know a, a more rounded life than just in Suffolk.  He went to Major League Baseball games, he was very avid baseball fan, he played baseball actually.  I guess what was called semipro, they got paid for Sunday evening, afternoon games I'm told, and he was recruited by I think the Pittsburgh team.  But at that point in time they weren't paying the kind of (laughter) of money they're paying these days.  And he chose, he was more interested in newspapers and becoming a newspaper man.
Speaker 1: Okay so he, he went to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], got his B.A. there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then, then he, now did, did he do any work for the Bay State Banner in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: He, he may have, he, he, he wrote for, he wrote for the Quincy--he was hired by the Quincy Patriot Ledger [The Patriot Ledger] I know that for sure, which was a daily paper.  And he probably wrote for other papers, again I wasn't in his life then, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't know.
Speaker 1: And then he goes to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] for his master's degree?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, that's several years later where after he had left the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers] he went to Howard to teach journalism.  He was brought there to be a visiting professor.  He, he, he made his mark in many ways.
Speaker 1: So he was a kind of person that would be hired in and teach because he knows his profession?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Not because of Ph.D. or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Exactly he was, actually Sam Yette [HistoryMaker Samuel Yette] was teaching there. He had known Sam from when he began his career he, he worked for Sam at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And now Sam had done the rounds of having been with the Peace Corps and the like and ended up at--
Speaker 1: He was the director of the Peace Corps--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and worked for Newsweek and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now we interviewed--
Speaker 2: And Life.
Speaker 1: --Samuel F. Yette back in 2003 [sic. 2004]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the author of 'The Choice: The Issue of Black Survival in America.' He is, he was then, he was for many years the chairman of the journalism department at Howard--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so your husband was there, was he the chair you think, or?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure he wa- no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was not the chair at that time, but he was obviously an influential person on the faculty there.
Speaker 1: Then became close friend of the family.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes he was my daughter's [Regina Boone] godfather (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so but while he was teaching he earned his master's at, at Howard?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 669226
Speaker 1: So after many, many years with the Afro American [Afro-American Newspapers] in Richmond [Richmond Afro-American] and in Baltimore [Baltimore Afro-American], he decides at some point to start his own paper, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so this is two--1991, or so?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes and the story goes from that even in college, he was talking about the fact that he was going to own a newspaper, he declared that.  And there is one family friend who became an investor in the newspaper in the Free Press, in Paradigm Communications [Paradigm Communications, Inc.] whose name is Bob Hayden, Robert Hayden [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden].  He is a, he's a historian as well.
Speaker 1: Is that the scientist historian from Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Robert Hayden, Bob Hayden.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They were in school together and he said--or in Boston together, I'm not sure they were both at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts].  But there was such a small group of people of color who were students at, at Tufts [Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts] and BU and BC [Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts] and the like.  So they met and they were talking one day, so the story goes and Ray [Raymond H. Boone] said, "I'm gonna own a newspaper one day."  And Bob said to him, "Well if you do, I will invest in it," and true to the conversation, he, he invested.  He is an investor and actually told that story at Ray's funeral services.
Speaker 1: Okay so that, the name of the now he started a, he, he started the Paradigm pub- Com- Communications first, right?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, Paradigm Communications is the corporate entity that publishes the Free Press, much like, much like The Wall Street Journal has a, I think it's, it was, may still be, Dow [Dow Jones and Company] owns the, The Wall Street Journal.  They, in other words, doing business as the Richmond Free Press.
Speaker 1: Right, okay all right.  And the name Richmond Free Press it sounds--I, I think of the Detroit Free Press when I think of the name.  But it it's probably not the first newspaper or the second or third who's named Free Press.  But is there a reason why he chose the name Free Press?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think that he; he wanted his vision was to be a newspaper for everyone, so he did not want to have the name imply that it was about one racial group or one ethic group.  But rather a newspaper that was fiercely attracted to and believed in the First Amendment, so a Free Press.
Speaker 1: All right so now he had just worked many, many years for the Afro-American which was named that way back--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when we were colored people and it was still called the Afro-American, right?
Speaker 2: Right and still to this day is, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was way back, and the, and it still is to this day, when we decide to call ourselves Af- Afro Americans at one time, and now African Americans.  You know it's still the Afro-American (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: So he didn't, he didn't want to identify with, with the ethnicity as such?
Speaker 2: Right but it was, but when we came here, and he was definitely the spokesperson, he was asked by a, another weekly newspaper, you know, "What is your newspaper about?"  And he said, "We're a newspaper for African Americans and at the same time for everyone."  And I remember the story it was a short--but the story was, "What does that mean?"  And you know after five years no one asked what does that mean, because we had demonstrated what that meant.  It meant that we covered; we covered people and issues as it related to the Richmond [Virginia] community.  Whether they were black, white, blue or green we, we covered it, and we had--
Speaker 1: But of particular interest to black people (laughter).
Speaker 2: And that would be of particular interest to black people.
Speaker 1: I think, I think it's pretty, when you look at the paper; it's pretty obvious who the constituency is on a level (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: --but, but I know we often have this, black people want to make sure that everybody knows that they're not discriminating against other people.
Speaker 2: Yeah and we believed, and he believed that because it was his vision, he believed that, that you cannot cover a city without being inclusive.  And that was, I mean for example, we have a, a feature called Personality of the Week.  The Personality of the Week can be of any ethnicity, as long as they're doing something, and they have to be featured as a volunteer.  They can't be paid for what they're featured for, and it has to be something that is of interest to the majority of the community.
Story_ID: 669227
Speaker 1: The paper started at, on Broad Street [Richmond, Virginia], right?  At--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --201 West Broad.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And is that, is that downtown here or is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: There's a hotel [Quirk Hotel, Richmond, Virginia] there now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So was, was his intent to be downtown because it's--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --always been downtown?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and we moved from 201 to 101 and then to 422 East Franklin Street, which happens to be next door to the daily newspaper.
Speaker 1: Yeah it's right across the street.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he [Boone's husband, Raymond H. Boone] was, he was--
Speaker 1: The Richmond Times-Dispatch, right?
Speaker 2: Correct and he was, he was almost giddy with the idea that we were able to purchase a building here next to the daily newspaper that had been such a negative force in the black community's life.
Speaker 1: So this is when--just being here when we walk up and, and the, the Times-Dispatch is much bigger.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And it's powerful looking, but when you look over here, this is like a very dignified and it had a presence to it, the letters are, you know are, are in relief out here, they're metallic and they look--it looks like a respectable establishment and, and the building is the old Imperial Tobacco Company of London [England], right?
Speaker 2: Correct, yeah it's a historic building and when we purchased it, it was I think it, it, it had some occupants but it was in need of a lot of restoration.  And we restored the second floor and that's where the Free Press [Richmond Free Press] offices are, and then we have tenants on the first and third floors so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I saw on the wall outside the Golden Hammer Award (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --given for quality--
Speaker 2: For our--
Speaker 1: --construction prop- rehab projects in, in the city.
Speaker 2: Well for this building for, for what we did particularly on the second floor here.  And you know one of the things that we pride ourselves in is that we had--all of our investors were African American.  And our rehabilitation or--work was done by, was led by a black construction company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean we wanted to demonstrate that quality could be done in that way and the interesting thing was this, used to really both annoy me and amuse me.  When we first started and the newspaper came out and people would ask, "Well who owns you?"  They, there was a view by black and white people that the quality of our newspaper, which I think is second to none.  The only lacking quality is the lack of advertising and that's a reflection of racism in this country.  The, the thought was that because it was quality; it had to be something other than black owned.
Speaker 1: I mean the, the lobby, the rooms in here, I mean are some of the most orderly and neat we've seen in any newspaper, you know, black or white, in the country I mean we, we remarked, we were talking to each other and said, "You know this is really--," we expected the, you know, to have like boxes in the way and have a small space to occup- you know, 'cause most of newspaper interviews we do, wherever they are, are like cramped you know, we have to, there's hardly any place to do it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know so and so any rate so this is, it's an impressive place and I mean the paper looks really good.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: The photography is strong, it's a nice display of photographic work out here.
Story_ID: 669228
Speaker 1: You know, I haven't spent a lot of time reading it, 'cause I--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --I read some online (unclear) as we sit here today, Richmond [Virginia] has a, a black mayor-elect, Mayor Levar Stoney?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And the--an outgoing black mayor, Dwight--
Speaker 2: Jones (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Jones [Dwight Clinton Jones], right, the police chief [Alfred Durham] is black I mean, what's the demographic here in Richmond, in terms of--
Speaker 2: It is now about 49 percent black.  There's been a recent reversal. It used to be predominantly black, but as the--white people are moving back into the city.  That's (laughter), that's as plain as I can put it, and you know there's that word gentrification that's occurring.  I have mixed feelings about that, I think it--overall it's good because we need the tax base.  There's a lot of poverty in the city still, and we've got to address issues of related to education or the lack thereof of quality education.  So yeah it's about 49 percent now.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I read here that the revitalization cost nearly $2 million?
Speaker 2: Of this building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And black people invested their money in it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah we, we have two entities, the entity that owns the building itself, which we moved in, in 2000, and then the paper which--the newspaper [Richmond Free Press].  Which was, we started, will be twenty-five years old this coming January.
Speaker 1: Okay and I know Raymond Boone [Boone's husband, Raymond H. Boone] stated when he started the pa- paper he said that the paper's goal was to bring a halt to the deplorable situation of one conservative daily paper [Richmond Times-Dispatch] controlling Richmond's news agenda, right.
Speaker 2: There you go, yes and we have tried as best we, well he did that and after his passing we have tried to keep faith with that, that goal.
Story_ID: 669229
Speaker 1: What role did you take with the paper when it opened (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When it started?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I was responsible for advertising and I was the advertising director, I sold advertising, we- let me tell you what we did, and I'm, I'm very proud of this.  The investors in the newspaper, in Paradigm, invested a minimum of ten thousand dollars.  And we had about twenty investors, twenty to twenty-five, some invested more than, than that.  At the end of five years, they got all of their money back, plus during the five years they got, they received 10 percent on their, on their investment.  And at the end, they got a balloon payment as well, that was all germa- generated, generated by advertising.  The newspaper broke even and made a profit, even in that time, we were working super hard to make that a reality.  The downturn of the economy in that, in what--
Speaker 1: Two thousand seven [2007], 2008?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, really hit us exceedingly hard and that along with the explosion of the Internet has caused us to have, we're, we're still, we're still surviving.  And we're still doing okay, but those two factors have hit us hard, but we're still here.
Speaker 1: Yeah now the Internet phenomenon has, has grown as a problem I suppose because I know when we talked to the owners of the Afro-American [Afro-American Newspapers] back in 2003, they were talking about the same thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They were talking about posting a digital edition of the Afro-American and being a necessity 'cause, now some newspapers around--black newspapers around the country have done this and some have not.  Now I'm sure there's some white papers that haven't even done, done it yet.  But, but now the people tending more and more to--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the truth of the matter is you do not make money off the Internet as a newspaper.  The, it does not put you in a profit on the, on the profit side of things.  It, it's, it's a necessity for wider readership but it does not bring in the revenue that I think--it's not the cash cow that people thought it was gonna be, that's the point, that's the point.  But you know we're again, we're still here (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, now most of your, what advertisers really advertise in the Richmond Free Press the most?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Nationally, we have Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.], we have Comcast [Comcast Corporation], we have AARP [AARP Inc.] other, we have some groceries chains but they're, they're, they're intermittent.  We had Rite Aid [Rite Aid Corporation], they pulled out they went to another mode of advertising.  Churches advertise with us very faithfully (laughter).  And but that's, you know we have a church rate which is lower than a business rate, so that's not, that's almost a, a, it's hardly a break even kind of situation with them, but it's important.  One of the people who helped me, 'cause my background as you've walked me through this today, shows that I was not involved with newspapers at all (laughter).  I, I learned this you know on the job training, and John Murphy III [HistoryMaker John Murphy] was one of the Murphys that my husband [Raymond H. Boone] worked for.  He, he was an investor in the Free Press--in the Paradigm Communications [Paradigm Communications, Inc.], and he would come down to Richmond [Virginia] after he retired, and work with me in advertising.  And he helped me to understand what the right mix of advertisers are, and what I should be trying to, to achieve in terms of some, some advertisers are not moneymakers, but they're important to the mix of the newspaper.  Things I'd never, ever thought of, but I got a master's in, in, in advertising thanks to--and in the business side of the newspaper thanks to him.  And, and my husband, but John Murphy was, he was my hero (laughter) in this part of my life.
Story_ID: 669230
Speaker 1: Did the Afro-American ever, I mean so there was no tension between the Afro-American and the Richmond [Richmond Free Press]--
Speaker 2: Well we tried to buy, my husband [Raymond H. Boone] tried to buy the Richmond Afro-American [Afro-American Newspapers], 'cause it was still in existence when we came here.  And I think they sa- for whatever reason they didn't want to sell, they may have thought that they were strong enough to continue and that's, that's fine.  So once it was really clear that they were not going to sell then as I say, and it's really true, we started with one pencil and one piece of paper (laughter).  And, and you now started the newspaper ourselves.  It, had it--probably, had it been we bought the Afro, we may have carried the name.  It's likely that we would've carried that name but as it turned out, we didn't, and so he and, it was he and I, and I mean, again I don't want to make any.  He was the, he was the person with the vision, but I was the one who helped him with his vision.
Speaker 1: You're certainly, certainly considered capable enough to run the paper today. The board of directors chose you overwhelmingly and it wasn't a matter of you just telling people that you were going to do it (laughter).
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: It, you know, it was actually a process.
Story_ID: 669231
Speaker 1: Let me just talk about some of the highlights of the paper's history I guess, some of the issues around town, and some of the things the Free Press [Richmond Free Press] has tried to do that--I have notes here that the Free Press had something to do with re- the re- influenced the rewriting of the city code that expunged unfair gender references that, you remember that?
Speaker 2: That was supreme court, the Virginia supreme court [Supreme Court of Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  There was (laughter) there was a black justice who decided to keep the protocol of generations past, and not allow our photographer in the courtroom when he was, when he was ordained as the, as supreme court justice.
Speaker 1: This is Judge Hassell [Leroy R. Hassell, Sr.], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hassell yes.
Speaker 1: Hassell, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so that really ticked my husband [Raymond H. Boone] off, and that became an issue along with the fact that there were all these gender specific references that he felt was, was wrong as well.  And so for months, maybe a year or more he had a picture of Judge Hassell and a--a small paragraph about the fact that there were gender specific references.  Rather than non-specific gender references in the handbook and other things that, that the supreme court had, the Virginia supreme court had.   So yeah he, that was one of his that was one of his issues. My husband was very dogged in--he was like a, he was like a bulldog who got, got ahea- got a hold of something and he wasn't gone let go until he had to let go or he won.
Speaker 1: Now, now there was a case when someone named Judge Robertson, is he a local, was a local judge here?  Judge Ralph Robertson made some racist remarks and--
Speaker 2: Online?
Speaker 1: Yeah it may have been but he, he apologized to the black community of the City of Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah it was done in an online chat and I, one of our investigative reporters found out and we ran the story and he immediately resigned.  And in resigning in--he, he asked, he asked for forgiveness from the black community.
Speaker 1: Yeah he, he disparaged Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Reverend Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and he said that black people were disposed to violence because of genetics or something.  And, and it was all, it was much like the 'Notes on the State of Virginia,' by [President] Thomas Jefferson (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there were those kinds of issues there were issues of--wherein an insignia, I think Confederate con- insignia was on state aircraft.  And Jud- Governor Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder] was, was governor at the time, we a story pointed that out.  He re- he had him removed immediately.  There were, there were lots of, of issues that we had an impact on.  Certainly the fact that the person who ran with Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] for vice president--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah--
Speaker 2: --Tim Kaine was endorsed by the Free Press, when he ran the first time.  He ran his; the only advertising he ran when he ran for city council [Richmond City Council] was run in the Free Press.  And he, I mean we supported him every step of the way in his, in his in, in his work as, as candidates (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 669232
Speaker 1: The Free Press [Richmond Free Press] has endorsed candidates and supported candidates in the past. How are candidates vetted, is there an editorial board that sits discusses the merits of the candidates and?
Speaker 2: Well we, we do it two ways; we send questionnaires to candidates to respond to us so that we have something in writing to refer to.  And we ask a variety of questions related to the position that they're seeking.  And then for the mayoral race, we had the candidates to come in and meet with our managing editor, our senior reporter who's a political reporter, and I sat in on that.  After reviewing all of the questionnaires for those who did that, we sat and made--and also our, just our understanding of what's going on, and the positions that they've taken--we by consensus come up with who we, who we would support, that's how we do it now.  My husband [Raymond H. Boone] did it pretty much; I was not involved at all, because I was on the advertising side.  He and his reportorial staff discussed and he alone made the decisions.  We, we do it the way I just described; he would also have the, the top people who were the, looking to be mayor for example.  Though in the past, there haven't been a wide slate of people running.  This year we had, oh my gosh, nine to eleven people running--for mayor [of Richmond, Virginia].  And so we had to whittle it down and we ended up interviewing maybe seven people.  And out of that we had a discussion and decided who to, who to support.  We, we did not support the winning candidate but we, we think we made a, nonetheless, a thoughtful--and the person that we endorsed came in second.  We thought we made a thoughtful endorsement, but the people spoke and we're, we're certainly not displeased at all with the results.
Story_ID: 669233
Speaker 1: Who was the candidate that, that the Free Press [Richmond Free Press] endorsed?
Speaker 2: We endorsed a man by the name of Jack Berry [John Berry] who is white, who has, has held in the past several positions within government.  Both in a county, an adjacent county [Hanover County, Virginia] as well as in the city, and has run an organization in Richmond called Venture Richmond, which is a booster organization.  It's not to be confused with, with the chamber but it, it produces events that boost the spirit and the esprit de corps of Richmond.  Ironically the daily newspaper endorsed him also, and people thought that that was a good thing for the most part.  I never heard anyone say it was a bad thing.  The daily newspaper has moved farther to the left, it's more center than anything else now.  It's no longer owned by the racist family that once owned it. Warren Buffett owns it now.  Though I'm not sure he has any direct influence on what's going on in little Richmond, Virginia.  But the, the publisher of the Times-Dispatch [Richmond Times-Dispatch] is a--is a decent gentleman whom Ray [Boone's husband, Raymond H. Boone] called a friend and I call a friend.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now the Free Press has been involved in the campaign of Doug Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder], I think for mayor, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I think he'd already been the governor?
Speaker 2: When we moved here he was governor.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, yeah he was elected mayor and, was that in the '90s [1990s] it was the '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, that was, when he was mayor he, it was in the 2000s.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Mayor in 2000s, okay and Dwight C. Jones [Dwight Clinton Jones] the outgoing mayor, he was mayor from 2009 until this--
Speaker 2: Yeah he served two terms.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And Ray, I think it's fair to say he, he reluctantly supported him, but he supported him.  He happens to be our next door neighbor (laughter) and when the Occupy movement [Occupy Wall Street] was flourishing, there was an Occupy Richmond movement.  Again much--spearheaded by students from VCU [Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia], they were, they were occupying in a public area downtown [Kanawha Plaza, Richmond, Virginia].  And the mayor was calling for their removal from that space and so Ray in an editorial offered them our front lawn (background noise) as a place to come and set up a camp.  And they did, and I'm not sure that our neighbor was very happy with that (laughter) but it happened (laughter).  So Ray was a, Ray was a very in your face kind of person. He, he, he did not, he did not back down.
Speaker 1: I know that the sheriff is up for reelection this year I believe, C.T. Woods?
Speaker 2: Woody [C.T. Woody, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Woody, I'm sorry, and he so as a, did, did the paper endorse him?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay all right, and but, so the, the paper is politically involved in, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would say (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 669234
Speaker 1: And it's going into its, it's going into its--?
Speaker 2: Twenty-fifth year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, twenty-fifth year, it's approaching thirty years.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: So what do you see in the future of the--of Richmond Free Press?
Speaker 2: Well I, I hope it continues, I'm going to try to; I am in the throes making it as solvent as I can make it, so that it can carry on by someone else.  Not doing this forever couldn't do it forever, and we'll see, we'll see.  My, my daughter [Regina Boone] works for the Detroit Free Press; she's a fifth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She started here and now the connections seems interesting that she with Free Press in Detroit [Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Yeah she didn't, she, we, she probably didn't even know there was a Detroit Free Press when we started the newspaper, this newspaper.  But she came back from Japan after three years there and then a fourth year she traveled throughout Asia and Africa, and then came back to, to Richmond [Virginia] where we had then moved to.  And she started working here as a photographer, working with and for her father [Raymond H. Boone] was not the easiest task.  And she decided to go back to school and get her master's in photography, which she did at Ohio University [Athens, Ohio].  And was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that's a famous journalism school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: A lot of the big, [HistoryMaker] Clarence Page and Matt Lauer, there's a bunch of people they can list as members that came out, right.
Speaker 2: Right, it's a very good school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And she was hired right out of school as a matter of fact, they hired her, she hadn't finished her master's thesis, they wanted her right away.  And I'm so proud of her because she, she's covered a number of, of, of situations.  She, she covered the Rosa Parks funeral from all over with Miss Parks with--back to Montgomery [Alabama] and Washington [D.C.] and back to Detroit.  But more recently she has, she covered the Flint, Michigan water problem, and Time magazine ran a photograph of hers of a child who was affected by the water in Flint.  And--
Speaker 1: Now is she a photographer exclusively (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She's a photographer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --exclusively.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she's not so interested in running the newspaper but, and my son [Raymond H. Boone, Jr.] works here with me and he's, he's far more involved in the business side of things.  With the building, with--just the business side of the newspaper, so we'll see.  I think if we're good enough we can recruit someone, this is not a family owned newspaper, we have investors, we just happen to be the best people we know to run it right now (laughter).  But that can certainly change and we have an incredible group of people who work here.
Story_ID: 669235
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who are some of the people that work here and what do they do?
Speaker 2: Well we have Bonnie Winston, who's our managing editor. And Bonnie has, is--has been a Knight Fellow [John S. Knight Journalism Fellowship], she graduated from Northwestern [Medill School of Journalism; Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, Evanston, Illinois], which has a, an excellent journalism school.  She's worked for daily papers in, in Virginia and in Boston [Massachusetts]; we have Jeremy Lazarus who's--an award winning ph- journalist.  Our photogra- our lead photographer is Sandra Sellars; she's won numerous awards for her both national and local, statewide.  And just an array of people who have been here, most of the staff has been here since the beginning.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I like to think that that's because the environment is such that they feel they can make a difference, and they're still here.
Story_ID: 669236
Speaker 1: Now from the vantage point of, of a primarily Af- African American newspa- paper in a city like Richmond [Virginia], now what was your perspective on the last election, on the--well, well let, let me go back first of all to 2008, 'cause you all, the Free Press [Richmond Free Press] is a big supporter of Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Right, and there are signed copies of the paper out now, out in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah in our lobby.
Speaker 1: --in the lobby yeah and he won the state of Virginia--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, when he ran.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Both times.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Yeah so what and recently, you know we just had the, the election of Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump] which surprised, seems like everybody, including him.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: But do, do you have an analysis of that and, and does your, does your, your contact with, with I guess, you know the constituents out here in Virginia tell you anything about?
Speaker 2: Well Virginia went for Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton], went for the Democratic candidates, went for Hillary and, and for Tim Kaine.  So we delivered and we support we, we heartily endorsed the Democratic ticket.  Virginia is becoming a different state, and--even Chesterfield County [Virginia] which is of, of the counties that Richmond, it's, it's seen as the more conservative county, Henrico [Henrico County, Virginia] being the other one, Chesterfield.  And it's even becoming less Re- as a matter of fact Republicans did not carry Chesterfield County in this election, so yeah.  We, we feel that, we feel that, that we are having--we're touching the community in a way that is positive.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay on that same subject Virginia is a state that's really steeped in old, old--some of the oldest traditions in the United States, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: With the--yeah, with, you know Jamestown [Virginia] is right down the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Close by here right, right off the James River, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: There at the ocean, then you got you know this was the capital of the Confederacy at one time, right?  You got like--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --statues of Confederate generals like gods, you know, in the city.
Speaker 2: And if my husband [Raymond H. Boone] had his way, they'd be gone (laughter), so.  Yeah it is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you're facing one of the most staid and conservative traditions in the country, right?  Here.
Speaker 2: We are.  This is--to think that the Confederate flag was removed from the state capitol in Columbia, South Carolina [South Carolina State House] was remarkable for me to think about, and to see that happen.  Richmond, Richmond is--has some of the very same issues, but, I don't know, I think the symbols will stay here for a while.  And if we can interpret the symbols correctly then maybe they should stay, I--
Speaker 1: So, so it could be educational in some ways--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly, though as I said, my husband was, was very much against the monuments, so I'm not sure that I'm committing heresy now by saying (laughter) they could be an educational tool if interpreted correctly.
Story_ID: 669237
Speaker 1: When you think back now your, your husband Raymond [Raymond H. Boone], he passed in 2014, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What today would you consider to be his legacy (background noise)?
Speaker 2: He wanted his legacy to be that he helped as many people as he could with the resources that he had. That was what he said.  And that's what drove him every day.  He worked so hard, he was--in the family, we say, knowing a little bit about the salaryman in, in Japan.  Japanese men who worked, you know, their whole life is about work.  That, that was his genetics because he worked, he was a workaholic, and--but he, he worked toward his purpose.  And even when he was in the hospital, and he passed away of pancreatic cancer, he was, he was writing editorials in the hospital.  So he was driven.
Story_ID: 669238
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything that you've done in your career, is there anything that you would do differently, any major thing?
Speaker 2: Actually no, because each, while my career looks like it's a hodgepodge in some ways, it really, in my mind, isn't.  I was always selling an idea whether it was to poor people in South Carolina to register to vote, which I did one summer.  Or to people in Boston [Massachusetts] who needed to do something differently in order for the--to, to protest something within their community, I was selling them on the idea.  I was always selling an idea, whether I was lobbying for money, so at the state legislature in a given city or state or a state.  And even here, I'm selling, I'm certainly selling the idea of--that we put forth in the newspaper.  So I've always thought of--I haven't always thought of myself as someone selling, but that's what I do.  And I've just try to do that so that it affects positively as many people as I can.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what are you the most proud of?
Speaker 2: The, I am actually the most proud of the fact that I have two fabulous young adults [Regina Boone and Raymond H. Boone, Jr.] that are making their way in the world.  And are good people, they're trustworthy and good and that's what I'm most proud of from that perspective.  And then the fact that--we're still standing here at the Richmond Free Press, that would be the second thing that I'm most proud of.
Story_ID: 669239
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: That we have, that we have an appreciation for and, and an involvement being an educated people.  I think part of the reason that we have Trump [President Donald John Trump] as our president is that we don't have a well educated electorate, black or white.  People did not think about all of the consequences, they thought narrowly about the many things that he said.  So if he said one thing that attracted this group of people, better job, they didn't think about, okay so you elect him and you, he gets to appoint [U.S.] Supreme Court justices that are going to affect your life in a perhaps deleterious way.  I want to see us be far more concerned about education and that's very old fashioned but it's the truth, we just are not an educated electorate.  And we're not involved enough in--I mean people who have made it out of poverty, aren't reaching back in the way that, in the way that we should be.  There are lots of us who are doing it, but there are lots of us who aren't, and that's, that's important.
Story_ID: 669240
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't mentioned that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You have exhausted me (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  But you know I think people will appreciate it, at least the information.  The last question is, is like, is almost like the legacy question but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Much like my husband [Raymond H. Boone], that I did the best I could with what I have, and that I tried to be a good person.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
