Speaker 1: Now we'll begin [HM] Ms. [Wilhelmina] Rolark, and could you please--first let's begin talking about your mother.  Could you please tell me your mother's name and where was she born and where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Margaret; you want her maiden name or her married name?
Speaker 1: Her full name.
Speaker 2: Margaret Boykins Jackson [ph.].
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: As far as I know she was born in Virginia, Portsmouth, Virginia.
Speaker 1: And is that where she grew up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what do you know about her background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I--what I know about her background she was a teacher by profession and she was one of eight children, one of whom passed because she had something, I think it was called spinal meningitis.  That killed at an early age during those days so, so there were seven of them so she came from a large family.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION
Speaker 2: Great, thank you.  And you were telling us a little about your mother's background and her growing up.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, her father was a restaurateur she had six brothers and sisters; there were seven of 'em in all, that was a large family.  Originally there were eight and one died early, you know.  I think she died--she was musical, mother said, but she had spinal meningitis, whatever she had it took it quickly so there were seven of them.  She had four brothers and three sisters when they grew up, so she had a big family she came from a large family and her father was considerably well off because he had his own business and he served--and he sold his food that he made because he was quite a cook and all to men who worked, you know worked in Norfolk [Virginia], you know in the water place and they worked in what was called Lambert's Point in those days and he, he, I guess was one of the first that had a cafeteria style cooking.  That's the ways he served them was cafeteria style so they were able to work and eat, get back quickly to where they were working.
Speaker 2: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 1: She was a very vital type of person, number one she was well educated.  She was a teacher, elementary teacher and she taught in the country part of Virginia in those days and she had gone away quite young long before she was thirty to work, you know in the rural part of the state to teach.  She loved teaching and she loved children and when she stopped teaching after she married she had a what was called a nursery school, these days they would call it that, but she had it as an educational thing for little children up to the age of five before they went to school and she became quite famous for that she rented chairs from our church and the kids would come there.  She used to take them on nature walks; they were very intelligent children, all of them.  They were judges and teachers because when you get that early education, she always said if you get the education before five you can, you can create a child (laughter).  You can create 'em that, that was what she always felt confident about that, that you could teach children.  She even--she was so far ahead of her time, the special children who are retarded, you know, she said they were God's special children, she could teach them because she said all you had to do was slow down and teach them slow and they could learn the same thing.  Now, you know I guess she was way ahead of her time but that's the way she was because she had one of the retarded children in our area was in that class and what he would do--was a great big child, his mother--his father was a doctor, very prominent doctor at home and he would run across two blocks to get there and he was so crazy about her he would say, "Miss Jack", he called her Miss Jack, "Here, I come, here I come," and she'd go out there and meet him (laughter) because she gave him the same attention she gave the other children except she gave him more because he had that problem, you know.  He--He learned slow, she said, "All you have to do is go slow with them and they can learn the same thing."  So, his father was a doctor and he was just amazed that she could teach him.  I say all that to say that she, to me, was unusual, because most people just disregarded, particularly in those days, they now call them special children they have all kinds of special teachers.  That's what she was but she didn't get the money for it she just had--so.
Speaker 2: And did she ever share any stories with you about her growing up?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, because see she was the oldest and she had four of them that she grew up with were boys and they had the highest respect for her but she said they were like boys kinda cutting up mischief and all that she shared those kind of stories with me.
Speaker 2: Could you share some with us?
Speaker 1: Well, I--one that I never will forget they had a polly parrot, we called them polly parrots they're parrots and Nick [ph.], who was her oldest brother and who was an excellent cook, his father taught him all that and he became--he was head of the whole thing over there in Virginia Beach [Virginia], which I'll get to later.  But he came in real late one night and this parrot told on him, because he called him, he said, "Nick", you know, he called him (laughter) and woke up his father, you know who gave him the punishment for coming in so late.  That was a--just a real story about the thing because he had to push him or something like that--and then to push him, the parrot didn't make it.  But, he, of course was punished for going out like that.
Story_ID: 191709
Speaker 1: What about your father can you tell us his name and where he was born and where he grew up?
Speaker 2: My father was a native of Washington, D.C.  He was one of the first two black clerks in the navy yard [Norfolk Naval Shipyard] in Portsmouth, Virginia.  He had passed the examination and he, he came--that's where he met my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson], he came to Virginia, Portsmouth, that's where I'm from and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What's his--what was his name?
Speaker 2: John W. Jackson [ph.] and he was right in what we call old Ivy City [Washington, D.C.], are you familiar with Washington--yeah.  This is the middle north-eastern part of this city and in those days--it's now known as Trinidad [Washington, D.C.], and some of the neighborhoods have deteriorated, but in those days they were extremely nice neighborhoods.  When I say nice, they were old families, they were church families they worked in the civic part of the community, you know, because I had an aunt who didn't have any children but she went to all of the meetings of the school board because she was that interested in the children, Aunt Eva [ph.], his oldest sister.  He had two sisters, Eva and Jessie [ph.] and one brother that predeceased him, he had a brother that died from pneumonia in those days.  And he used to tell funny stories about that because he borrowed his brother's shoes one time and his brother saw him with them on and made him take them off, coming out of the movies with his girlfriend, (laughter) you know, just crazy story, but, but these are the kinds of stories that they used to tell.  Typical stories of siblings, you know.
Speaker 1: And what other stories did you father tell you, and did he ever share any stories about his growing up with you?
Speaker 2: Well that was one of them because you know, (laughter) that was very embarrassing, you comin' out of the movies with your girlfriend and your brother comes along you have to take off your shoes because he had on his brother's new shoes that he shouldn't have worn.  They 'bout the same size and those were, you know, just, just family stories you know like that.  And of course you know, I had great-grandmother on my father's side who lived to be 108, she was a Creek, Indian [Native American] you know, a lot of Indians in my family on both sides, and (cough) little grandma we used to call her.  She was very tiny and she only had one child which was my father's father--my grandfather.  And she was so independent, you know they were a very independent--Indians are extremely independent.  She never would live with anybody, he had a room for her across the street but she was over there all the time and I remember seeing her, she was very small, almost dwarf like she was so tiny.  But she was very energetic, she had to be she lived to be way up in the hundreds you know, and she used to come over and wash my grandfather's shirts.  Nobody could do anything for her son but her, like that.  But my grandmother had a great sense of humor she used to always say that was fine 'cause she didn't feel like washin' and ironin' those shirts, because my grandfather was a valet for a very wealthy man, Bishop [Alexander] Mackay-Smith, that they said used to live at or near 16th Street, [Meridian] Hill Park [Washington, D.C.].  He traveled all over the world with him, he was very, very--he didn't have a formal education, but he had that type of education.  And you couldn't tell that he hadn't gone to some of the best schools--he was very refined.  When I was at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] as a student my classmates fell in love with him.  When we'd go up there the servant, that used to wait on him, the bishop's servants waited on him just like he was wealthy and they would be served tea and cookies and what not they would get me, "Jackie, let's go see your grandfather." As if it were his--their grandfather, you know.  They would fight to be able to go with me to visit him and he liked them because they were all going to school.  He believed in the education.  Now my other grandfather I didn't know because he died when I was two.  He died early, the one that was a restaurateur, my mother's father.  But I knew my mother's mother [Dora Boykins] 'cause she lived with one or two of her children at all times, you know, she'd be at our house in the summer, somebody else's house in the winter, you know, she was always there, we always called her Mama 'cause she would look after us when our parents were working.
Story_ID: 191710
Speaker 1: And what else do you remember about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: On my mother's [Margaret Boykins Jackson] side or my father's [John W. Jackson] side?
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother's, your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, because my grandmother on my mother's side what I remember, you know, she had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was her name?
Speaker 2: Dora, Dora Boykins [ph.] and she was able to punish us and my brother [John Horace Jackson] and--I had one brother, one sister [Gwendolyn Jackson Bowie] and one brother.  And they used to call my brother and me the Katzenjammer kids because we were very mischievous and my grandmother used to tan us good (laughter) she had the authority to punish us (laughter) she didn't act like a grandmother when she punished you.  She tell you to stop she meant for you to stop.  So I definitely remember that, that we were, you know, we weren't afraid of her but we, we respected her, we knew she had authority.
Speaker 1: And did your grandmother ever share any stories with you about how she grew up?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't share stories about how she grew up.  She would sha--she shared stories with us about her mother, who was also Indian [Native American], you know Creek, they were all both--on both sides Creek Indian blood.  And her--and all those are very independent people, and her grandmother wouldn't live with anybody either just like my grandmother on my mother's side, I mean on my father's side.  So she had a small hut up in Suffolk, Virginia, which wasn't too far from where we lived.  And she would come and visit her maybe like once a month, she'd come and see Dora [Boykins], that was her only child, and see us and administer corporal punishment if it were necessary.  So, we were familiar with both of our great-grandmothers like that.
Speaker 1: And just going back to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not our great-grandfathers--hmm?
Speaker 1: And do you want to tell me what you remember about your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Not too much about the great--I know, know about my grandfathers, but not my great-grandfathers, but.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about your grandfathers, what were their names?
Speaker 2: Well my grandfather on my mother's side died when I was two, so I don't remember too much of him except to say that my sister, of course, who's older than I, they said that she and I, when he died, you know, went down to the coffin--they had a real peculiar story they told about the two of us.  That we came down stairs and viewed his remains.  You know people used to bring the corpse home.  And did something, and we were about to pour water--give him some water as if he were alive and someone stopped us.  They told that story for years and as I grew older I used to get embarrassed about that story that we would go down there and disturb our--a dead person, you know, but I was with her and she was my older sister, seven years between us.
Speaker 1: What about your paternal grandfather?
Speaker 2: My father's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you remember?
Speaker 2: --father--oh yeah, I remember him, he's the one that worked for the bishop, Bishop [Alexander] Mackay-Smith.  He's the one that I used to visit with my friends from Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He lived a long time.  And he's the one that I said the girls used to fight for the privilege of going over with me to visit so that they could be waited on by the servants that waited on him.  They weren't a bit more interested in me at all, they were interested in that service (laughter) because the man he worked for was extraordinarily wealthy, you know and they treated him because he was the bishop's man, he was his valet.  He traveled all over the world with him and so he was well educated that way even if he didn't go to school and he was refined, you couldn't have told he didn't go to the best schools going, you now he was a very nice man--
Speaker 1: Did he ever share any stories of growing up with you, any stories about his background?
Speaker 2: No because you see I wasn't around my grandfather like that, that grandfather.  When the other one died as I was telling you when I was two, two or three.  I wasn't around him when I was literally growing up because he was in Washington [D.C.] and I was in Portsmouth [Virginia].  I was around my grandmother on my mother's side, but I would visit the grandfather in Washington.  We always came to Washington for two weeks, my father us a two weeks' vacation, my mother--we would come up here and my uncle was one of my mother's brothers was steward on the Washington steamer [Norfolk and Washington Steamboat Company].  The old Washington steamer used to run between Washington and Norfolk [Virginia] and he was a steward, which was quite a job, you know, he had to prepare and buy and purchase the food and all you know he was highly respected because, you know, people had to have a little money up and down the water on that steamer, the Washington steamer.  And those are some very--and he was able to--you talkin' about summer jobs for youth, he was able to get summer jobs for people.  You now like cuttin' potatoes for the food and cleanin' up on the ship and what not, he always got jobs and so when they went, went to college they always had a summer job for the summer, you know, and he always told them that try to do so whereby you can make your own living, that's what he always preached, my uncle, which is one of my brothers--my mother's brothers--
Story_ID: 191711
Speaker 1: And just going back to your father [John W. Jackson] for a second, how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a very--he had a great sense of humor and he was one of the first two black clerks in the Norfolk Navy Yard [Norfolk Naval Shipyard] at home [Portsmouth, Virginia], you know, only two blacks passed it and he was one of them, other than that people had other types of jobs, servile type jobs and he always preached one thing to us, get a good education, so you wouldn't have to work for, in those days "The Man", which was a white guy, you know.  So you would have something of your own then that's why we all grew up in a very independent fashion and studied very hard in school.  He was very smart, and they only had two black clerks in the Norfolk Navy Yard at that time, which was a big source of employment otherwise people would go to the [U.S.] Navy, you know, cause I grew up in Portsmouth [Virginia], which was a Navy town, you know, from a--nav--what they would call Navy babies (laughter).  And, but he had a good job, he was a clerk and you didn't have--there were two black clerks in the Navy yard at that time, he was one of them.
Story_ID: 191712
Speaker 1: What do you know about your ancestors, how far back can you trace them and what origin and do you know if they were slaves or if they were free?
Speaker 2: I didn't know them as slaves.  I've told you about my--on my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson]--on my father's [John W. Jackson] side.  On my mother's side I did not know my--I didn't know her father, her father died when I was two.  And I told you he was an independent restaurateur, very big one.  He had a lot of money, he had a yacht, I mean, he, they grew up like wealthy, they grew up like rich peoples children (laughter).  Anyway, because they did, he was well off, my grandfather on that side, but he died early because he had kidney disease.  Anyhow.
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever share stories with you about growing up as an African American in a very wealthy family?
Speaker 2: Well, well off, I mean they were independent, you know they had their own business, that's what I'm trying to point out and that's what they always preached that you learn to work for yourself, you know, that way yeah--and in that way you don't have to be beholdin' to people you know, so, that's the type of atmosphere I grew up in on both sides.  My [paternal] grandfather, although he worked, was a valet for a very wealthy man, he did not like that.  He was extremely independent and he always said, use what I give you to go to school, get an education and he pushed you and all of us had good educations, you know.  My father's children, I mean my father's nieces and nephews, their father died early.  My grandfather educated them.  One of them became principal of Cardozo [Senior] High School [later, Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] here, Sojourner [ph.] Jackson and you know, they, they were taught, you get an education and if you get an education you can make it on your own.  That was a very good upbringing that we had on both sides.
Story_ID: 191713
Speaker 1: [HM] Ms. [Wilhelmina] Rolark, tell me about your earliest memory of growing up, what's your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory, you know, I grew up with my brother [John Jackson] (laughter) the two of us, two years between my brother and me.  They used to call us the Katzenjammer kids we were so bad.  And I remember once my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson] took us to a little field place right--about two blocks from where we lived and buried us (laughter) with leaves, babes in the woods, crying, ooh we were so scared but her best friend who lived across the street told that she had gone too far and she came and rescued us from the little wooded area where she had left us.  She was going to come and get us but she was going to teach us once and for all that you know you had to behave.  I never have forgotten that because we were scared to death and I thought, I--my brother had more nerve than I only--but even he was afraid.  Because she left us there, about three to four hours and Ms. Brown [ph.] came to get us (laughter), who lived across the street.  And told my mother she had gone too far (laughter).  She said, "Mag," my mother's name was Margaret, she called her and she said, "Mag, you gone too far this time, shouldn't leave those children there, like tha-like they might die of fright!" (laughter).  But we were cryin', but--and cryin' loud, you know, real loud, but nobody could hear us 'cause it was about two blocks from where we lived, she just left us there she said I'm going to teach you all once and for all that you can't really just have your own way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --I never have forgotten that, it was scary.
Speaker 1: --what was daily life like in your house growing up?
Speaker 2: It was, it was somethin', it was nice, we had a nice life.  I was very fortunate because both of my parents [John W. Jackson and Margaret Boykins Jackson] were well educated and both of my parents liked other children so we were always had children in my house.  My father, he would tutor them in math and mother would tutor them in reading because they both had good educations they shared it because my mother said she always wanted to see who we played with they could come right in the house.  And I remember that on Saturday nights we'd have this big card party, you know like Whist and different things that you could play together, my mother was, what you would call now, a card shark, she could really play--she was a bridge player.  And out play everybody (laughter) of course she would read and what not and she loved, she loved cards. She say cards taught you a lot of skill, but she didn't gamble or anything, but she liked it.  And we had---there were--one of her best friends was Miss Johns [ph.] who was a nurse, her husband was a doctor, and she and this nurse could beat people, you know, they'd go downtown and beat some of the doctors downtown.  They used to get a lot of pleasure out of that, and my father used to refer to them as her "card playing" friends, you know, (laughter) he'd be sittin' home readin' he didn't play cards.  But she was, she was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: And what other memories can you share with us about growing up, what were holidays like at your house, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Holidays were very good, we were very family oriented.  And as I told you, she liked our friends and our friends could be in and out of our house.  And she was an excellent cook and so we would have big holidays, you know. And she was very good, as was my aunt, who lived up here in Washington [D.C.], with their fingers, you know.  They all knew how to do something like that, my grandfather, they tell me was a superb--he could knit, you know, he could make whole things and so he taught them how to use their hands and what not.  So growing up, holiday time my mother would make dolls, make the dolls and make the dolls clothes, not only for me but for friends, you know--had around.  They liked doing things like that, and they could do it.  I don't have that skill.  I guess because she used to do it all (laughter).  And, but the dolls would look just like somthin' from downtown at one of your big stores because she knew how to--and she could crochet me a whole dress, you know she had a lot of skill with her hands.  And my aunt up here had a lot of skills with the needle.  She sewed for some of the wealthiest people here, she could look at a pattern or look at a dress and go, go to one of the most exclusive stores downtown Auerbach's [department store] and look at the windows with her customers and make the outfits, that's the way she was.  And my mother, if it were lingerie, like for their trousseaus, people used to have trousseaus in those days, my mother could do all of the handy stuff like that, crochet to make them look real good, you know, they made good money doing that.
Story_ID: 191714
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your brothers and sisters and please tell me their names in the order of their birth including yourself.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I'm the middle child.  My sister was the oldest.
Speaker 1: And her name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a teacher.
Speaker 1: Her name?
Speaker 2: Gwendolyn, Gwendolyn Jackson and she married a man by the name of John Bowie, and who was an employee of the [U.S.] government, treasury department.  She married here in Washington [D.C.] and they met at high school, they--both of them went to Armstrong [Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.].  See I grew up in Portsmouth [Virginia], but my sister, my father [John W. Jackson] sent her away to go to school because he felt you could get a better education in Washington and he was from Washington, which was a good idea in those days.  So she--she was always at home during the summer but in the winter months she was up here getting her education, she became a teacher.  And then she was able since she was a teacher, she was seven years older than I, when she became a teacher she was able to help me in school.  I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So it was your sister and then?
Speaker 2: Me. My--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And then?
Speaker 2: --brother was the youngest.
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: His name was John Horace Jackson, he became a doctor.  A medical doctor, he was one of the first two black commanders in the [U.S.] Navy.  He and the other commander made the front page of Ebony [magazine] and he is on record as the history--what is the--what is the location, do you know Joe [Joseph Elam (ph.)], the history place right out here on M Street [Washington, D.C.]?  You know where they have all the records-ever--he's, he's there, and, the other doctor, and they, they, people visit that when they come in to visit because he was--they were the first two black commanders in the navy and they made the cover of Ebony.
Speaker 1: And what street did you live on growing up and can you describe your block in your community?
Speaker 2: You want her to stop?  Do you want to?  I grew up on a street known as Downs, D-O-W-N-E-S, 1 Downes [Street, Portsmouth, Virginia], only had two houses on the street.  And, that was the street that I grew up--that's what you asked?  That's my answer.
Speaker 1: And can you describe your block or your community?
Speaker 2: It was just two houses on that, my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson] said she always liked to get the corner house, and so it was a corner house so you wouldn't be impacted by a lot of houses, you know, so you literally had your own, own house (laughter) you know, your--just your house on that block.
Speaker 1: Can you describe your community?
Speaker 2: It was a very nice community, because remember I lived in what they called--it was a [U.S.] Navy area, see everybody, everybody literally had a job.  Because if you weren't in the navy as a sailor or what not you worked in the navy yard or businesses that survived because of their affinity to the navy, you see.  And that was--we have the second largest Navy yard in the United States of America, it is in my hometown where I was born.  Norfolk Navy Yard [Norfolk Naval Shipyard], I know you've heard of that, that's in Portsmouth [Virginia] my home town.  They covered the name of it, they said for camouflage, you know to be--protect the area, it was always known as the Norfolk Navy Yard, but it was really in Portsmouth.
Speaker 1: And what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So everybody literally had a job (laughter).
Story_ID: 191715
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: One thing I didn't like about growing up, we were very close to what was called the Gana [ph.] factory, that was a factory where they tanned hides of horses, you know that gives a very omi--very bad smell, especially like five o'clock in the evening.  And I never liked that time of it because it would be there even though for about an hour and it would pass off, but people were working.  It gave them jobs, that's one thing my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson] always said, some child is eating off that.  That was her famous saying (laughter).  Don't worry about that, some child is eating off that, 'cause she meant that the father had a job, because you know jobs have always been difficult to get for us.
Speaker 1: And what sounds and sights remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well you know anything that gives a boat sound like a boat.  It's, it's sort of like a mournful sound when a boat takes off.  I'm always reminded of my home when I hear those sounds that are related to the water.  I remember once after I was on the city council [Council of the District of Columbia] we went over to Germany, Calvin [Rolark] accompanied me and I, I heard some of those sounds and they took me way back, you know, sort of a mournful sound, when the boat leaves harbor.
Speaker 1: And what sights?
Speaker 2: What sights remind me of home?  Anything that's related to the water, although I don't swim, you know, boats, swimming.  We had a beach at home known as Buckroe Beach [Hampton, Virginia], that was the black beach and it had a lot of quick sand in it and I never learned to swim because I saw so many--not so many, but a lot of people would go to their death--getting' caught in that quicksand and, you know, that the black beach--they had places like that, which  if you weren't careful if you got caught you would die because no one could get to you in time to rescue you, very colorful.
Story_ID: 191716
Speaker 1: So Ms. Rolark if you will, let's talk a little bit about the elementary school years, and which elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Truxton [Elementary School, Portsmouth, Virginia] it was named right after the area that I was born [Truxton, Portsmouth, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any teachers there that influenced you and if so what were their names?
Speaker 2: Well I liked all my teachers because I liked school, I loved school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was supposed to have been a very good student.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was a good student, I liked to study.
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about it, elementary school?
Speaker 2: I, li--I remember that I used to li--always I guess it was a bad att-- I like, I liked to be first.  That made some of my friends angry too, you gotta win this you gotta win that, I was that way.  Very competitive and I strictly remember it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your friends from elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes, a girl, two girls, both of their fathers worked at the navy yard [Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia], you see that's the way things happened and both of their fathers were, one of the fathers was a very good friend of my father [John W. Jackson].  Bea Harold [ph.] was her name and her father worked at the Norfolk Navy Yard too, he was a clerk.  You see you had minimal numbers of clerks, so when you were a clerk, you know that was considered a very high rating, although you might more money doing something else.  But the fact that you were a clerk in, you know, implied that you were educated.  So Bea Harold and I remember her father was very proper.  He used to roll his R's, r-r-r-r-r, I used to like to hear him talk (laughter).  And my other friend, and I recently seen her, about three years ago I saw her she was living over here in Arlington [Virginia]; she's a retired nurse now.  She finished from Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  Her mother was married to a sailor and her mother had, you know she was limited because she had one arm, but she was very neat and she could do a lot of things.  I remember I was always fascinated because she could move around with that one arm and do a lot of work.  And so we all grew up together and they used to walk me, home or I'd walk with them to school and people thought we were crazy, three of us, you know they'd say, "Y'all gotta--why don't you go to your own home?" you know (laughter).  But we were all friends, we were close friends.  My parents liked it because their parents worked, you know, in harmony like with my father. They had pretty good jobs, you know, I don't know in those days, just like people try to do now, you're very careful of who your children play with.  So I distinctly remember that because we were together all the time, you know we went to, went to school together and then we went to, you know, play together, and then our parents visited together you know and so there was like a close relationship.  Almost like family.
Speaker 1: And at this time in your life, did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: I knew I wanted to be educated because I was--my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson] and father always emphasized that, to get a good education.  I liked school.
Story_ID: 191717
Speaker 1: Were you thinking about what you wanted to do or be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I always wanted to be a writer, that was the funny part, 'cause I think I was telling Dr. [Joseph] Elam [ph.] that once.  When I grew up that's what I wanted to do because you see I came up in an area where The Norfolk Journal and Guide, have you ever heard of that?  It's a very big newspaper.  P.B. Young was the editor of it, editor, publisher, black man and so you see, I always--and we used to be taken to the plant to visit and see how they do it--how they did a paper and how they, you know, they run, or print it up and all of that and then you were able to talk to them and of course their people, the boys and all, boys and girls had jobs taking the paper, you know distributing the paper around so it was a very important part of the community.  I distinctly remember that because that's how you made your summer money and all, you know, because you had customers, you know and it was very, it was very--because you know down there people had jobs because you had the Norfolk Navy Yard, second largest in the United States of America.  It's called the Norfolk, but it was in Portsmouth [Virginia] and that's where most people worked.  So I have a distinct memory of that because that was like the, the, it was like it was just a place where you could learn a lot, it was fascinating and you could see the product being turned out in the plant, you know, and then it could come out and we would be selling it.  My brother [John Jackson] was one of the distributors of it, The Norfolk Journal and Guide, you know.  And of course I used to like to read it, and they had a page on there that was called the colored page and I remember the fella who was the editor of the colored page, see in those days it was the colored page (laughter).  And, 'course Calvin [Rolark], when I married Calvin, said that, when you--you remember when they had that weekly for The Post, he was saying, The Post was coming close to being the colored page (laughter) you know because it was right up about us, yeah, but anyway, it was, it was a real--it made you become interested in learning and trying to know how to be somebody, understand?  Because you were dealing with newspapers, you were dealing with focuses of communication and of course my mother was a writer.  She was not only a good speaker, excellent speaker; I tell people my personal joke is I was raised by Barbara Jordan.  She could speak and she could recite Shakespeare and then she could recite funny things and she would raise money for our church by doing comical, like the preacher.  The preachin' she would make my brother so angry, she would dress up as a preacher, my mother was heavy, she'd dress up as a preacher and she was heavy, fat like, you know (laughter) and she'd have on this black pants and all, my father would say she doesn't mind being a fool and all, she doesn't mind people laughing, and she'd (laughter) an she'd be laughing and my brother'd be cryin' because he didn't want his mother to do that (laughter).  But I'd be laughing, but he, he did not like her to do that, 'cause that's the difference between boys when it comes to their mother.  "Maggie, you--I don't want to see you in that preacher's suit," and she would come in with this stick, you know, just like the, just like a black preacher in the country, you know, and she would imitate 'em, so.  I have some very vivid memories of those things--
Story_ID: 191718
Speaker 1: And my father [John W. Jackson] was the church clerk, we were, we were members of the biggest Baptist church.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 1: Oh, my memory slips me on that, the name of the church--Zion, Zion Baptist [Church, Portsmouth, Virginia], that was my church.  And my father was the church clerk, you know, read--read all the notices and my brother [John Jackson] didn't like it because my father would put--his sight was great till he died, but he would put these magnifying glasses, I guess on the end of his nose and read the--and green shade and read the church notices and he didn't like that.  You know you don't like to have your parents do stuff that your friends are laughing at, an, an my father didn't mind them laughing at him, he had a great sense of humor too, you know, it didn't matter to him, but we--but my brother would be the one embarrassed by that (laughter) and he would be read the notices and.
Speaker 2: What were some of your other experiences in church?
Speaker 1: In church?  Well, of course we were in all the programs, you know, I could speak my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson] had taught me how to speak, and so I would always be on programs to speak and what not, you know.  My brother, at that point, I don't know whether you're familiar with this but at a certain point in a boy's life the voice changes, up to a certain point he could go real high and he used to love to sing 'Trees' [ph.], but when he became like seventeen the trees began to crack (laughter) he couldn't sing it anymore and he stopped singing.  You know your voice changes as you get older.  But both of us were very active in church, he was a singer in the choir and I could speak and we, we loved church.  My mother was a very odd woman because where we lived in Truxton [Portsmouth, Virginia], she let us go to Sunday school right out there because we could run over there and go on our own.  My father didn't like it, he wanted us to get dressed and go downtown to the big church.  She said "No," said, "let them"--my friends were out there in Truxton--and we were important out there in that little church, you know, so when she said no--and it was a very good experience for us.  It got us attuned to the church at an early age, you know.  She was that way, she was far out, she could see ahead, you know, in life.  He said, "Oh, everybody should go to the same church."  She said, "Not necessarily."  You know if you were Catholic and we were Baptist, it didn't matter to her, she said long as you're going to a church.  And this particular church that we--that my brother and I liked was what we called the little church, it was a very small church, but everybody was friendly, you know.  And they gave us positions, we could read notes, and minutes or we could get up and make a speech or what not.  We couldn't do that downtown 'cause the church was too big.
Story_ID: 191719
Speaker 1: Were there times when you were growing up with your brother [John Jackson] that you missed your sister [Gwendolyn Jackson Bowie] or do you think your sister (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, we loved our sister, but you see she was growing up here [in Washington, D.C.] because he [Rolark's father, John W. Jackson] wanted her to have that Washington [D.C.] education.  And we looked forward to the summer, we'd be so happy, but the only thing is my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson] would let my sister punish us and she'd be playing cards and what not and so she could administer the whip (laughter).  And, so we, we loved her but we knew that my mother gave her that authority, and she loved that authority, she could use it too.  And she loved us, you know she liked coming there for the summer because we had a nice big lawn and she was born in July and my mother'd give her a big party.  My mother and I both were born in September, so we never had a party because school, she said she had to spend the money on school clothes.  We had one party that I can remember, and boy we had a good time.  One party, all the time (laughter) growing up.  She said the rest of it she had to buy clothes, you know, for school and books and what not.  But my sister always had a huge party because she was born in July.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the party you remember.
Speaker 2: That my brother and I had?  My mother became angry with me because I invited everybody.  It was so packed you, you couldn't get--you know, she said--I remember her saying this, she called me, she say, "Fool why did you invite"--everybody  who wanted to come came.  And she had a hard time fixing stuff for the thing she said, "I see I can't give you a party, 'cause you don't know how to discriminate, you know, don't invite everybody to the party".  But I did, I invited everybody, we had a good time.  One party that's (laughter) we had.  'Cause she had to get clothes and stuff for us--
Story_ID: 191720
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about junior high school.
Speaker 2: We didn't have junior high school in my day, you went directly from elementary school to high school.
Speaker 1: But as a young person approaching the teenage years, you were still at Truxton [Elementary School, Portsmouth, Virginia], tell me a little bit about your friends and what your life was like then?
Speaker 2: Well I think I told you about my two girlfriends and where both of them father's worked in the navy yard too.  And we used to walk to school together, come back home together, you know we were like the three musketeers they used to call us, 'cause we were close, you know, we were just always together because our parents worked together.
Speaker 1: And how long did you attend Truxton Elementary?
Speaker 2: Well, elementary school was eight years--seven years and then I went to high school, I. C. Norcom [High School, Portsmouth, Virginia] that was in Portsmouth [Virginia].
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had to take the street car to work--I mean to school.
Speaker 1: --and as a young person still in elementary school approaching the teenage years, who was influencing you and can you describe some of your experiences then as a teenager?
Speaker 2: Now, now you asked first, you asked me elementary school?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am, as a young teenager thirteen years old?
Speaker 2: Well you know, try to, to--one thing was always impressed on us that we had to get a good education, so I remember studying a lot (laughter) reading and studying, yes and going to libraries, yes.  But it was, it was a very education, and was very competitive because you like to be first, you know.  So I was ahead of my class both times.
Speaker 1: And were you still aspiring to become a writer?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I--that's actually what I wanted to do was to write.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about the high school years, where did you attend high school?
Speaker 2: I. C. Norcom High School in Portsmouth
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like there?
Speaker 2: Well, it was very pleasant, you know, the same friends went to the same high school because didn't have that many--you know, choices.  I enjoyed those years, you go--you could go to the games, you know the football and the basketball.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers in high school?
Speaker 2: Oddly enough I remember my English teacher and I remember my history teacher, both of those were women.  And my chemistry teacher was a man.  And I remember him because, you know, in chemistry when you don't have a lot of supplies, and we didn't because our schools were heavily segregated you--that sulphur, whatever that stuff is that smells so terrible.  Well I remember those smells that came from the chemistry classes, you know.  And I really didn't like chemistry because you had to survive those odors to get--but we had a very good teacher.  And my English teacher was very good and my science teacher was good.  We had good teachin' because you see when I was comin' up teachin' was a great profession.  It's not like it is now.  The teachers got pretty good money, the mailman got pretty good money, you know you could count the people who made pretty good money, but people liked to come and teach in our area because you see the men had good jobs because they're working in the navy yard and the women, most of them taught.  So I remember, I distinctly remember that and I distinctly remember that I didn't like chemistry because those odors that came from mixing those things, you know you get that funny odor it's a real bad odor (laughter).  Sulphur something you call it, I don't know sulphur dioxide or whatever.
Speaker 1: And as a young lady in high school [at I. C. Norcom High School, Portsmouth, Virginia], what kind of young lady were you?
Speaker 2: I can't--somebody else would have to say that--I can't--all I know is that I, I, you know, just went to school and studied and I liked to be very high in the class, you know.  And we went to church all the time and you went to BYPU [Baptist Young Peoples Union] and whether you had after school church activities that were very popular during those days.  And during those days you also had certain big parties that were given at Christmas time or Easter time and whatnot that everybody would come to who was in a certain grade or certain class.
Speaker 1: Can you describe some of those parties?
Speaker 2: They were nice, just, just the usual parties.  You always had pretty good music in that area.  See Portsmouth [Virginia], that's the area Ruth Brown came from, need I say more?  She was from Newport News [Virginia], very good music all the time.
Speaker 1: And at this time in high school were you still aspiring to become a writer and were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --thinking about going to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't change that for a long time.
Speaker 1: Were--what were you thinking about in terms of college?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [John W. Jackson] was pushing me, I had a four-year scholarship to Virginia State [University, Petersburg, Virginia] 'cause I was the head of my class.  And, I was all prepared to go to Virginia State because that's where my friends went and whatnot and that's a good school.  But he insisted that I come to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] because that's where he had gone to school, cause I remember he and my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson] had an argument about that, she said, I had the scholarship and it wouldn't have cost anything and that's what--that's her argument.  I often wondered what would have happened if I had gone to Virginia State, which is a good school.  That's where I believe Reverend Farnwell [ph.] went to for a while, anyway that was a long way after I was there course 'cause he's much younger.  Anyway, to make a long story short, I was still thinking about writing at that time.
Story_ID: 191721
Speaker 1: So, how did your father [John W. Jackson] convince your mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson] that Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] would be the best choice?
Speaker 2: She went along with it because remember I told you my aunt lived up here [Washington, D.C.], which was her sister and my sister [Gwendolyn Jackson Bowie] had gone to school up here.  'Member I told you when my father sent her up here to go to school, so it was just like an extension of home, you see because in the summers he would give us a vacation up here, we would come here two or three weeks.  And stayed with her and then I would be part of the time with my [paternal] grandparents over there in Ivy City [Washington, D.C.], so--
Speaker 1: And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)it wasn't that much difference.
Speaker 1: And what year did you attend Howard University?
Speaker 2: In the '30s [1930], I started in '33 [1933] I think it was and I went all the way through and then I went back to Howard to get my master's.
Speaker 1: So you were at Howard from 1933 to 1937 undergrad?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And what were the years like undergrad?
Speaker 2: They were very nice because I stayed in the dormitories and met a lot of new friends and life was very pleasant.  I tried working (laughter) I decided I would try waiting tables and I wasn't a good waitress, never was.  But I wanted to help my parents, you know, I had a scholarship but that wasn't enough to pay all that and then my brother [John Jackson] was right on top of me to go to school and he wanted to be a doctor 'cause he had been sickly, so.
Speaker 1: So at this time when you first entered Howard were you still aspiring to become a writer?
Speaker 2: My, my taste began to change because I began to become influenced by my teachers.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some of the teachers--
Speaker 1: --who were influencing you?
Speaker 2: --well I had Mr. Hunton [ph.], who was my English teacher; he was very smart, that still kept me in the writing mode.  And then I met Dr. [Ralph] Bunche when I went and I became a graduate student.
Speaker 1: So your, your degree that you received from Howard, your undergrad degree, what is that in?
Speaker 2: Bachelors of Law, LLB.  Bachelor of law, just bachelor, that's the first degree you get in college, yeah, it had no relationship to law, it's just called Bachelor of Law, LLB.
Speaker 1: And when you graduated from Howard, what were you thinking you wanted to do next?
Speaker 2: At that point my mother was saying, get a job (laughter).  Stop going to school and get a job.  Take something whereby you can get a job.  I can remember her saying that now, "Look young lady, you, you're--you gotta start making--you, you gonna do somethin' where you can make, make a living."  'Cause, although I was waiting tables and stuff like that and had a scholarship, still wasn't enough and then my brother was right on my heels, you see.  And he wanted to take medicine and so all this was going to cost money.  But so she say, "Get a job, just do something whereby you can get a job," I can hear her say it now.
Speaker 1: And what was Howard University like in the '30s [1930]?
Speaker 2: It was a lot of fun, we had a good time there in the dormitory there, yeah.  Good teacher--I had excellent teachers 'cause see I was in social science.  My teachers, I read just like a book.  I had E. Franklin Frazier, the great sociologist and he taught me sociology.  Dr. Abraham Harris, the great economist taught me economics and Dr. [Ralph] Bunche of course, taught me political science and Dorthy [ph.], Everett [ph.] Dorthy who was my undergraduate tea--teacher in political science, great guy, they live right here in Washington [D.C.] on 9th Street.  And he just, he was just down to earth, he taught you about life and political science.
Speaker 1: What was it like studying under Ralph Bunche?
Speaker 2: It was good, he was a good teacher.  Dr. Dorthy was a little more fun.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Well, we could go to his house and he wasn't married 'cause Dr. Bunche was married and had a family, you know.  But when you go see Dr. Dorthy, he was just one of the students almost, you know.
Speaker 1: And how do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But he was a very, very good teacher, because he was like down to earth.
Speaker 1: --and when you go past Howard today and you see Howard today, what are some of the changes that you see that--how has the school changed?
Speaker 2: Lotta changes now, you know a whole lot of changes in that period of time.  I don't get up there that much really.  But it's my school and I got two degrees there 'cause I went [Robert H.] Terrell [Law School, Washington, D.C.] for law, at night.
Story_ID: 191722
Speaker 1: After you graduated from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], you stayed there and got your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I got my master's [degree].
Speaker 1: --and tell me how you came to that decision?
Speaker 2: Well to tell you the truth it was hard, hard times.  So staying in school you know you're still like, like a student.  That's why my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson] was saying to me get somethin' whereby you can get a job, you know, just don't continue just going to school.  And so your interest begin to change because you want to be able to be self-employed and you have to think of what you can take, you know, and some of those social sciences wouldn't fill the bill on that.  Law, somewhere that you can learn something whereby you can make your own living, you know.  And see so many people in my family did that, either they did it connected with food or whatever but they were self-motivated themselves.  My aunt had a sewing seamstress business.  She sewed for some of the wealthiest people here 'cause she was creative, you know, she didn't have to use patterns or nothin' she could just do it.  And, so we came from the thing that said that you do it on your own or you know you get a job whereby--you can take care of yourself like that, so.
Speaker 1: And so when did you receive your graduate degree?
Speaker 2: '38 [1938].
Speaker 1: And what was your [master's] degree in?
Speaker 2: Same thing, political science.
Speaker 1: And what were you thinking you were going to do were you still aspiring to become a writer?
Speaker 2: Well at that time my interest began to change because of the employment situation, you gotta get a job, you know.  Remember I was telling you my mother was saying just get a job (laughter).  You're going to school a lot, just get a job.
Speaker 1: So why didn't you get a job as a writer?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't--never thought of that.  There wasn't a--what was there to write in those days.
Speaker 1: So you got your first job?
Speaker 2: No, I continued in school, remember I went back and got my master's.
Speaker 1: Yes, so after you received your master's what did you do next?
Speaker 2: That's when I decided to go to law school [at Robert H. Terrell Law School, Washington, D.C.]--I, I just got a job in the [U.S.] government.  You know this is a government town and I was working in the treasury department at midnight and I decided to use the daytime part to go to law school because I had a, not a daytime--night time law school, [Robert H.] Terrell Law School [Washington, D.C.], that's where I went 13th [Street] and U Street [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: What was your job like in the treasury department?
Speaker 2: Not at all interesting, I was a graphic type operator.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: It's just, you know, it's just like a typewriter except that the product you use you know, for print material.  I didn't like it at all.
Story_ID: 191723
Speaker 1: Why did you decide to go to law school [at Robert H. Terrell Law School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: So I could make a living (laughter), on my own.  I was going to be self-employed and that's what I did.  I came out I went to law school and I took the bar and I passed it the first time and I've been working for myself ever since.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like at law school--how--what were your experiences like?
Speaker 2: Well, law school--the law school I went to was very interesting because I guess I was among the very youngest going there 'cause I had just come back from school [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] there but a lot of those were people who had been out in the community.  For instance, one of my good friends was Reverend Miller [ph.], he had a church, but he was taking law too in the evening.  These were grown folks who went back to school and so it was a completely different experience.
Speaker 1: And what law school did you attend?
Speaker 2: [Robert H.] Terrell [Law School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And who is Robert Terrell?
Speaker 2: Robert H. Terrell was bor--the first black judge here [in Washington, D.C].  His wife was Mary Terrell, I know you know of Mary Church Terrell, she's very famous she was the originator of the Colored Women's Clubs [sic, National Association of Colored Women, NACW], which is a different thing than the National Council of Negro Women, but on the order.  She was the founder of the Colored Women's Clubs, that was all over the United States she was an extremely well educated woman and very militant.  Take up issues, yeah 'cause I remember she demonstrated on the segregation issue.  'Cause I remember I was out there demonstrating with her and I got tired and I was taking a break and she said, "Young lady, wha--what is wrong with you?"  I said, "I'm tired, I'm all right I'm just tired."  She said, "Get right back up", I was sitting on the edge of something, "And come on out here." (laughter) She said, "You're young, and demonstrate." (laughter).
Speaker 1: What year was this and what kind of demonstration was it?
Speaker 2: It was '36 [1936] and it was just, you know, I can't particularly remember what we were demonstrating about but Howard University [Washington, D.C.], during those days, we were always demonstrating on something.  There were a lot of issues out there.
Speaker 1: Is that when you started to become interested in human and civil rights?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, all of that occurred at Howard, because you know you had a completely mixed student body.  You had white, black, West Indian, whatever, Africans all of those went to Howard University.  And it was a very mixed up--mixed school, and you could learn a lot just from the con--just from the people in school.  Just from the students without even going to class.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your law school classmates?
Speaker 2: Well see I was in a course that a lot of women were not in.  I was in political science, but two that I can remember most of all you must--you may know them or know of them.  One of them became a judge, Washington, James Washington and the James Washington before he became a judge was with the public service, you know, commission that's over your lights and your gas, all of that.  Which was a political appointment, and Walter Washington, who became a mayor [of Washington, D.C.] was a classmate of mine too.  So you see all of these were interesting careers and they came out and became successful and you could follow each other that way.  But I took the law and became a lawyer and I practiced full- time and I was considered a good one, I really was.  I loved it, I really did.
Speaker 1: What did you love about it?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean the competition.  And in fact, women, we were very rare, as lawyers.  And I didn't do a lot of criminal law, I did a lot of civil law, but I liked to win my cases and they didn't have what you have now, which is you appoint lawyers to handle certain criminal cases and they're paid by the government.  We had to earn our own, you had to go to the family and see could you collect something for doing all of this free work, for whomever had committed this crime, you now, in their family.  And so they had somethin' they used to call the mourners bench, you would sit up close to the judge, and one of those judges, Judge Raibey [ph.], her father was a police chief somewhere, she used to give me cases 'cause I was the only girl, you know, on the bench.  And she said, "You gonna have a tough time out there (laughter) with all those guys."  But I could win my cases.  I study hard and, I don't care how little the case was, I just want to win it.
Speaker 1: And going back to your decision to go to law school, what did your mother think when you told her you were going to go to law school?
Speaker 2: She thought I was a nut because she said I should get a job and stop trying to get money from my father (laughter) I heard her one night, "Just go head, get a job, teach."  'Cause everybody was teaching in the family, I come fa--from a family of teachers on both sides, which was great, except my aunt.  She worked for herself, she was a seamstress.  She could have taught 'cause she was very smart, but she used it--you know, she was creative--creativity.  And the funny thing about my mother, as she became old she used her creativity then.  She used to crochet and make crochet dresses and what not and they taught people how to make flowers some place over in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.], she went over and taught--took there and learned to make the flowers and sold them to my friends.  Both of them were creative, I don't know what happened to me, I'm not creative like that.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from law school?
Speaker 2: Forty [1940], it was in the '40s [1940s], '44 [1944] I believe, yeah--
Story_ID: 191724
Speaker 1: And what did you do right after you graduated from law school [at Robert H. Terrell Law School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Practiced law.
Speaker 1: You opened up your own (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I passed the bar, immediately.  I passed the bar immediately.  The first time I took it and one of my teachers, I never will forget him Weeks [ph.], Maurice Weeks, from Harlem [New York, New York], he told me I was the best student in his class, so he said I could come to his office in the evening and learn about the practice, which was doing a whole lot of work for Weeks, but anyway, it taught me a lot because he was very smart.  He had three kids and he had to get out there and make some money for it.  But he taught me a lot of stuff about the practice and I used to go in his office in the evening and, you know, and do interviews, did a lot of work because I wanted to learn, you know.  And he was considered a very good lawyer.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first case?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember my first case.  I did all kinds of case, I wouldn't remember that.
Speaker 1: And what do you think was the most beneficial thing you learned working in his office?
Speaker 2: I learned how to practice law, exactly what I was saying to you.  I learned how to interview people and how to work out the mechanics of being a lawyer, you know, that you have to learn how to structure your fee.  See what you have to do, you go to the library, spend a lot of time in the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.], in their law lib--li-law library.  He was smart, he knew how to, he knew how to make a living.  He was from New York, he was from Harlem [New York, New York].

Speaker 1: Ms. Rolark, tell me about when you first met your husband [Calvin Rolark].  What year was that and how--how did you meet him?
Speaker 2: Well, I met him; we were both active in the U Street Business and Professional Clubs [sic, Association, Washington, D.C.]  You remember I told you I was a lawyer and he was a journalist.  He was working with The New Observer.
Speaker 1: About what year was this?
Speaker 2: That was, that was in the four--just aft--that was in the '40s [1940] isn't that right, Joe [Joseph Elam (ph.)], that was in the '40s [1940], the U Street Business and Professional Association. Yeah, [Theodore R.] Ted Hagans had organized it and he was, he was the manager of The Dunbar [Hotel, Washington, D.C.], which was our black hotel.  You, know, 'cause everything remember was highly segregated at that time and as long as it was segregated blacks had their own business.  They were doing all right, you now, integration is good, but integration wiped out some of that volatility that we had to do on our own because then we were just fighting for position in the integrated groups, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you think integrated--integration helped us more than it hurt us--hurt us more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, wou--I wou--
Speaker 1: --than it helped us?
Speaker 2: --I wouldn't answer a question that broad like that.  All I can just tell you about experiences that I had, you know.  In some instances.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: In other words, businesses that you had on your own, you kept those because they gave you position and they gave you status and they gave you opportunities, but then when things became highly integrated and then you would start competing, people started competing for position in that, in the integrated society.  But they soon learn, I know--remember we had a real big argument, heated argument in the Washington Bar [Association, Washington, D.C.], which was a segregated lawyer's organization, we still have it.  There were some lawyers who wanted to abolish our association once we became integrated and joined the Bar Association of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] which was integrated.  And I was among the group that fought very hard not to abolish it.  You know we used to meet over at the corner of D Street, at 4th [Street] and D Street, Northwest [Washington, D.C.].  We used to have more fun there, but that's where all the lawyers met, but once we were integrated they came into the District Bar Association [Bar Association of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] and they started going to those meetings and they were lost because there were so many more white lawyers, you know.  Now, we came all the way back 'cause some of us fought never to abolish it and it's still in existence.  I still go, I was secretary for a long time, but now they have lawyers.  The younger women lawyers are now the president and the vice-president.  They're way up in position, but I still go to the meetings, still belong.  And--but if we had abolished it, you know, where would they be?
Story_ID: 191234
Speaker 1: And so let's continue talking about how you met your husband [Calvin Rolark].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I met him in the U Street Business and Professional Association [Washington, D.C.].  He was working as a journalist and I believe it was with [J.] Hugo Warren who was the editor; he was publisher also wasn't he?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yes.
Speaker 2: Editor/publisher of the New Observer.  I think that paper's still out there, but you don't hear that much about it do you?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear)
Speaker 2: So how did you meet him?
Speaker 1: I met him in the U Street Business and Professional Club [sic, Association], we were both members, both members of that.  I was there as a lawyer, you see because that's what it was.  U Street, business and professional association, and professionals like doctors or lawyers as belong to it as well as newspaper people.  And it was like a gathering place and Ted [Theodore R. Hagans] was a very good business man, you know he became a millionaire in the hotel business, I guess you know that though, but he was the president, and right there at 14th [Street] and U [Street, Washington, D.C.].  And that's where that club operated from, U Street Business and Professional Association.  Everybody who was in a profession or in a business--not everybody, but particularly the younger ones, we like to join there because you'd see others and you could advance your profession.
Speaker 2: Was he intimidated at all by the fact that you were a lawyer and a woman?
Speaker 1: Not at all, (unclear) you didn't know him at all did you, you couldn't intimidate Calvin, no, he wasn't that type of a man.  He was very aggressive and very self--you know, he, he, he, he, he understood himself and he had always been on his own, because before he went into publishing he was an insurance man and if you know, I don't know how much you know, you're from this area [Washington, D.C.] but see if you come from the South you can understand the importance of insurance.  Insurance is where a lot of blacks, you know, became very prominent, wealthy and everything else because black people have always bought their own insurance.  Quite frankly, I believe it's going to return to some of that with this health insurance crisis, you know a lot of people are losing their health insurance.  But anyway, that's where I met him.
Speaker 2: And how did your courtship begin?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, we, went with social things with that too.  They gave parties and all the rest of it, met him and his brother and one thing evolved to the other, okay.
Story_ID: 191235
Speaker 1: What was your life like in the '50s [1950s] and what kinds of activities and things were you involved in in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: I've gone through some of it.  I was practicing law and you know, I was a--busy in the community [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: When did you start becoming interested in politics?
Speaker 2: Well you know, remember we didn't have politics (laughter).  You can't be too interested in something you didn't have.  We didn't have politics, when we got politics, and that was my field, political science, I became--I immediately became--'cause I remember I said to Calvin [Rolark], "I would like to run for office."  He said, "I think that's a very good idea."  He was coming out here [Washington, D.C.], you know, 'cause, we were married then.  But anyway, because we didn't get--you know it was a long time before we even got the right to vote for your mayor.  They talkin' about home rule [the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, 1974] here now, but that was a fight to get to--it was under [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson, we got that opportunity and Walter Washington was like a protege of Lyndon Johnson's because you see the first mayor was appointed.  And he was appointed by Lyndon Johnson, we didn't have an elected mayor in the beginning, it was an appointed mayor.  And [HM] Sterling Tucker, I'm sure you're familiar with him, he was appointed, the chair of the Council [of the District of Columbia].  See these weren't elected, these were appointed positions but that's how they got their experience, you know.  And finally the [U.S.] congress gave us the right to elect them.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: I don't know the exact year, but that's a matter of record.  I don't like to give you an erroneous date right now, but I can get it and get it to you.
Speaker 1: And so when you made your decision to run for office, what office did you decide to run for and why did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I took city council [Council of the District of Columbia] membership.
Speaker 1: --you want to run for office?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be active in my community.  I already was active in the community because long before we got elected we had Polly Shackleton and a group of people from ward three who were active in the Democratic Party.  I was always active in the party, used to go to all these meetings and whatnot, long before we got any right to vote or anything like that.  And when they finally, you know--member I told you at first we had the appointed mayor and the appointed council and it was from that that you finally got the elected one, so an elected one you had a right to run to see if you could, you know, achieve office.  And I had remained active in the community, it's about being active in the community you were known, and then I was a lawyer and I used to win some cases and so, you know, those are the kind of things that helped you know because I belonged to Shiloh [Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.], it's a big church, it's down at 9th [Street] and P [Street].  And was always active in Shiloh at--during those years, I'm not now.  I go to church but I'm not active like I was when I was much younger.  But I used to be--participate in stuff and give speech--try to get people registered to vote and all of that, you know that was very important.  And we still don't register like we should and even though we get registered some of us don't vote like we should, you know.  We could do a lot better if we went out there and voted you know.  So, that's, that's a failing we have as a group.
Speaker 1: And so when you first joined the council in the early '70s [1970s], what were some of the things that you did in the beginning?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to take up issues.  For instance, I was known for my stance on things like rent control, you know.
Speaker 1: What was rent control like, back then?
Speaker 2: You, you, you gotta have rent control for black people to survive in this city.  And some people would constantly working against it.  Which initially a lot of whites would have made a lot of money; you know the Jews and the whites who owned the properties.  But you have to have rent control so that--the same issue is up there now.  We are being moved out of the city because we can't pay that rent, and if you don't own, and a lot of our areas are being taken over and become areas where you have to own in order to stay there.  And it's very sad when you see it because you saw it coming a long time ago, you know.
Story_ID: 191236
Speaker 1: So the first committee you chaired on the city council [Council of the District of Columbia] was the committee on employment and economic development?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: What was some of your work and some of the highlights of your work on that committee as a chair?
Speaker 2: You know, trying to get--I had a--I remember I had an issue called jobs--I had a piece legislation dealing with creating jobs, jobs creation that was a tough committee 'cause you know it was hard gettin' a job and jobs creation, you can't create--you gotta have something to create it from, you know just like now.  But it was very interesting and--you met a lot of people and I can never forget the lobbyists, 'cause they're always trying to get you to come over to their position, but I, I was known to resist them, you know what I mean.  I wouldn't vote against rent control for nothing in the world, and vote for jobs and I always was liberal on the issue of criminal law because even then they were trying to put everybody away.  And you could see it coming.  And see, when I used to practice law, I practiced in criminal law, you know, and I knew that a lot of young blacks, particularly were being shafted.  Just being railroaded (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you think that's changed today?
Speaker 2: Naw--it's worse, it's really worse.  All they have to do is go and visit the prisons.  Do you ever go?  Wherever you go, you ought to go and visit them if you consider yourself an interviewer and what not.  If you don't know anything about the prison system, you don't know your race.  Cause that's where they are, they are killing the black family, cause they arresting the young black guys and giving them long sentences and making up charges and--it's sad, it's really tragic, what's happening.
Speaker 1: And are you, are you saddened that it's gotten worse instead of better over the years?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, you know, it's what the man does to you.  You gotta have--you gotta be savvy on stuff like that.  If you're not you don't even understand the world you're living in.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: You, you'll be one of those people who sit on the block and say, well you know he shot this one--we ought to put them all in jail, lock them up.  We had one council member, very well-known lady, [HM] Nadine [P.] Winter, she was very active she represented ward six.  "I get tired (slams hand down) of you Rolark, what you're saying!  We ought to lock 'em away, lock 'em away and throw away the key."  Now she doesn't feel that way now, 'cause she sees the bad thinkin' that went into a statement like that.  Because you see, they have plans and they keep their plans going and we don't--some of us, I wouldn't say all of us, some of us are not observant as to what's happening to them.  Many, I'm not talking about you individually, or me individually, maybe you can do a good job for yourself, but I've always been interested in the many.  You understand?  So I don't know.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And I feel you need to have more of us--particularly young ones interested like that, 'cause if they aren't you're not going to have the black family, as you know it 'cause all the men are going away before they can get a family.  They got same sex marriage now but they can't have no children.
Story_ID: 191237
Speaker 1: After chairing initially the employment and economic development committee, you then moved on to public service and consumer affairs [at the Council of the District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: That was very important, that had to do with your lights and electricity and gas and you talkin' about lobbyistss, you really get those lobbyis from the big firms and all of that, and I made some very good contacts with that.  That was a very exciting committee.  And developed the energy bill, you know.  I've--I did some--well, you'll see it in that.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit about the energy bill.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the manner in which we get your bills and so forth, this all created from lobbyists on other issues, you know.  And you really have to be active yourself as a consumer of those services in order to keep yourself from just being run out of cities because you can't pay your bills, you know, so.  I remember Charlie Warfield [Charles Morris Warfield, Sr.], you'll see, I don't know if his name is in there or not, but Charlie Warfield ran a union that dealt with that issue.  He was a great guy and was a great friend of mine.  He had a great union and we used to work on those--he could see way ahead and he said, I remember him telling me, "Wilhelmina, it's going to get worse and worse, and finally your telephone bill will run you out of your house."  And it's almost gotten to that.  See, but he was a thinker and he was interested in his community, but, sometimes people just sittin' by and lettin' the world go by and they end up they don't have a house, they don't even have a car because they can't pay that bill, they can't pay their utility bill.  Your utility bills will kill you.  And, you know, it's, it's very sad.
Story_ID: 191238
Speaker 1: And your last ten years on the Council [of the District of Columbia] from the early '80s [1980s] to the early '90s [1990s] you chaired the committee on the judiciary?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about some of your work over that decade.
Speaker 2: That was very, very challenging.  Because as I said, that's when the laws--you know they looked like they have a plan, you know, and the issues then become trying to keep your youngsters from getting incarcerated (laughter).  And being charged you know it looks like every black guy you see is a potential criminal which is not the case.  Not the case.  And you get neighbors who said, excuse me, like I told you this girl [HM Nadine P. Winter] used to say, "Lock them up and throw away the key," which is not at all a smart observation to make because if you lock up all the guys where will your families be?  Understand?  And then everybody that commits a crime is not typical of the whole community.  And that became the attitude, that all of them are out there tryin' to sell drugs or do this or do this so forth.  And you know the real sellers and the real munitions makers are not us.  I mean I know you know that (laughter) got to know that.  And, that's where they make their money, guns the biggest business in the world.  And the way they talk about it it's as if we're the ones in the gun business.  We have the guns, you know, after they make 'em and sell 'em and all the rest of it, but that's not our business.  But that's really destroying communities.
Speaker 1: And you, you've also done a lot of work on sentencing guidelines.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Why is that important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, that is exactly what I was talking about, the numb--the way, the way sentences are levied is to kill your groups, you know.  You have to--I'm not for these very harsh sentences, very long and harsh sentences, not at all.  But, you have to fight it, you know.  Remember I told you there was one person on the council that said lock 'em up and throw away the key, that's what she said.  That's the way she felt.
Speaker 1: But--can you tell us a little bit about some of your sentencing guideline work?  I mean were you successful in reducing some of the sentencing guidelines et cetera, can you tell us a little bit about that work?
Speaker 2: Well, the sentencing guidelines you were constructing the sentences at that time and that was not just me, there was a wide spread effort going on and it's still going on, you now.  And, my part there was trying to look out--particularly for the juveniles.  You know, you, you cut off a person juvenile years, you cuttin' off a life, you know?  And, especially when you see certain neighbors that just make the statement that they're no good they're gonna to do this; they're gonna to do that.  You can't make those kind of statements you know, you never know when it's going to come back on you.  That's number one.  But number two is, it is--it, it sort of just sentences the whole race to do nothing.  They will have you believe that that's the way we are.  You know it's not that way, I mean all we gotta do is follow politics a little, that's one reason why I'm very happy that I took political science because I was able to understand that from another perspective, you know, not just from the law part.  From drafting the laws, you know, because I know a lot of it comes from drafting the laws, and whom you put in office and whom you let--select as the resident and the vice-president, that's very important.  And that's what really saddens me that so many of our young people don't vote.  They say it doesn't--I know you've hear them, you're very young yourself, but I mean you've heard people younger than you saying it doesn't make any difference and it makes a big difference.  I hope maybe what I've just said here today shows you what kind of a difference it makes.  You gotta have somebody on the side to stand up and make a defense of some of these unfounded allegations--
Story_ID: 191239
Speaker 1: Over your four terms on the city council [Council of the District of Columbia], what are some of the accomplishments that you're most proud of?
Speaker 2: Well I think you've got a rundown of 'em right there.  I think some of the things that I was most proud of, number one, we talked about energy.  I was the author of and establisher of the [D.C.] Energy Office [Washington, D.C.], you wouldn't of had it.  That was one of the toughest fights.  They didn't want it, the big lobbyists fought it, they did not want the energy office.  Because you know, that's where the money is in your light bill, your electric bill, your gas bill and all that.  You'd be surprised, thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars I should say.  So, I was very proud of that.  I was very proud of that.  And, I was proud also my term on the sentencing guideline commission to work on trying to defeat the efforts that they were even putting in to put people away for a long time because I knew that would impact the communities.  Particularly our communities, and those are among the things that I liked most and both of those are very challenging committees because you really got the impact of lobbyists stayed in my office.  Because see one was on those utility bills and you know that effects everybody and the other was on law, was on the so called criminal law.  'Cause they'd like to make out--some people like to put out the illusion that all the blacks are the criminals and that's not true, you know that, what's happening now will let us know that.  Current history teaches you a lot, and I remember.  And that's where my political science background really enables me to understand what's going on now because you see, I've always been interested in that, what's happening overseas, what's happening in areas other than our areas.  How it impacts and impacts heavily it really does but you gotta have people get out there votin' discussin' issues, takin' part in issues.  And there's nothing is as sad as the schools is it?  Cause with all that Brown vs. Board of Ed [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]--none of that matter--all of that is very important but what matters is your control now of the schools and how your children are being educated.
Speaker 1: And what are your thoughts on that as we celebrate the fiftieth year--fiftieth anniversary of Brown vs. The Board of Education, what are your thoughts as we kind of reflect and look back over the past fifty years.  How do you think African Americans have fai--have fared in the educational system?
Speaker 2: Well I--what I think, I agree with Justice [William O.] Douglas when he said there will be a long time before you really were able to implement what Brown v. Board of Education was supposed to do.  Because of the use of that phrase, "All deliberate speed", and it's extremely slow.  If--you know, it's very, very slow and it will be slow because it--nothing is there in that decision to give it any impetus, you know to make it happen faster.  And all we have to do is look at the schools; the schools are just about as segregated as they were.  You look at them, you have all black schools and all white schools, you know.  Now it's determined by where you live, and where you live is determined by what you can make, and look how our communities are changing right out here.  You are not going to know out here in the next couple of years, invasion has already begun and blacks are losing their homes, they can't pay the rent and even if they own, they can't keep up with the expenses of it because this is really gonna to become like high rent, right out here.  See we got the river, the Anacostia River, which is in the process of being developed and like on my street, they have developers looking at Valley Avenue [Washington, D.C.] and whatnot which abuts Foxhall Place [Washington, D.C.], which is where I live.  And this was considered a poor downtrodden area, no longer.  This is where the money's gonna come, money is coming all the time, so, it's sad.
Story_ID: 191240
Speaker 1: And reflecting back on your years on the city council [Council of the District of Columbia], is there anything that you wish you would have had more time to accomplish or something else that you wish you could have done during your time there.
Speaker 2: What I always wish was that I could inspire more young people to vote.  To vote and run for those offices, you know.  But you know, you look at it they don't even appear to be interested.  And it's the single--one of the single most important things because it's going to determine the quality of their lives--what happens in the laws that are created by the members of the council, who draft and construct those laws.  And it--you know it just saddens me when I hear people say it doesn't matter.  Why have I--Why have I got to get out there and register to vote, it doesn't matter, nothing is going to happen.  And it's happening every minute (laughter).  I needn't go into great detail but I know you know what's happening, and it's going to continue to happen unless some of us change our perspectives on things, you know.  And so that's so important with education you know and there are many ways you can educate other than just in the schools.  You can educate in your communities, on your block, in your neighborhood and particularly you can educate by getting people registered to vote.
Speaker 1: And as we talk about education and we talked a little bit about Brown vs. Board of Education [of Topeka, 1954], what would you like to see happen in schools, particularly in this area in Washington D.C.?
Speaker 2: What do you mean what would I like to see happen?
Speaker 1: What do you think--how would you like to see it--what do you think would be--how would you like to see Brown vs. The Board of Education working?  How--how--could we determine or define its success?  What would it look like if it were successful?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing I, I think I indicated from the beginning, you can't just look at Brown apart from what happens in the community, you got to look at where people live.  Because they go to school from where they live and that's what I was saying, that you have to look at the complexion of our communities and what's happening to our communities, and money is going to be a very determining factor as to the construct of our communities.  Some places, you take ward eight, which is considered the poorest ward in the city, it's going to become almost impossible to live in ward eight.  It's too high.  You got the river, which is Anacostia River and you have all these developers, they're walking these streets every day, and yet you still have young people say it doesn't make any difference how you vote (laughter).  It's a self-defeating attitude--
Story_ID: 191241
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your work with the SCLC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  When did you first become involved in that organization?
Speaker 2: Well I became involved, you know, from the marches because I knew Reverend [James] Farmer, my husband [Calvin Rolark] knew him very well.  And my husband was the one who was very active in SCLC.  I wasn't.  But he was a member of the board and I used to accompany him to some of the meetings, you now, just sit as an observer, you now because you can sit there as an observer--because I've always been interested in that type of thing.  And I was interested in [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and his philosophy and all of that and of course, the big march was here [March on Washington], if you recall.  And the 'I Have a Dream' speech was made right here in Washington D.C.  And, after he [Calvin Rolark] passed, they nominated me to become a member of the board and I am pre--currently a member of the board.  But it's a little different then what it was when Dr. King was living, because, you know, it's primarily, it's a lot of preachers are on the board you know that?  But now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Sirens) Hang on one second Ms. Rolark; let's let the siren go by.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, well, Miss Rolark, could you just tell me what year--around what time frame did you first start becoming involved with SCLC.
Speaker 2: After my husband's death.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He died in '44 [1944, sic, 1994].  It was October, isn't that right Joe [Joseph Elam (ph.)]? (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  October 23, 1994.
Speaker 2: After that--see 'cause I told you he was a member of the board, and of course I used to always try to go to the meetings and listen, you know.  And I was on the council; my life had been mostly political.  But, I'm a Baptist also, so I'm familiar with Baptist preachers and how they do, it's a lot of preachers on the board.
Speaker 1: What do you think about the work that SCLC is doing?
Speaker 2: Well I think SCLC can do a lot more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: --I do.  Well. I mean they can get more active in terms of, you know, it wouldn't be anti-religious to encourage people to register to vote.  And that's what they're doing now.  You know, they have--what did they--they got a special name for it, that's what I was trying to recall.  The name of this campaign that Martin Jr. [Martin Luther King III] started, but--even he now is doing something else, but--and it was particularly going to be aimed at young people, young blacks to get them to actually become involved in voting and registering to vote and running for office because he could see that you need to do that.  Of course, Martin himself used to say that, that you've got to become part of your communities.  But unless we do that we're skipping a big opportunity because it's almost amazing how many young people just not even interested in voting.  They don't, they don't think--they say it doesn't make any difference.  If you could just, if you could just divest them of that cavalier attitude that it doesn't make any difference, maybe we could start making a difference in our communities.  That's what I believe.
Story_ID: 191725
Speaker 1: So Ms. Rolark [HM Wilhelmina Rolark], tell me about that story we were talking about, Brown v. The Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  But you said there was also another public case?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, there was, there, there was the one of the first sit-ins took place in Alexandria, Virginia, where two lawyers, young lawyers the Tucker brothers, Otto Tucker and Samuel Tucker, sat-in in the library [Alexandria Library, later, Barrett Branch Library] in Virginia (laughter) in Alexandria, Virginia.  You know Virginia is a tough state to do anything like that in.  And they were arrested of course, and as a result of that case, they were arrested and went to court and all the rest of it.  That was, to my knowledge, among the first sit-ins, it could have been the first, but I know it was among them.  They wouldn't move, that particular library in which they staged hat has now become a historical site.  It's been made a historical site in Alexandria.  People come from all over to visit it, and there has been story written about it because you know, it was just unheard of.  That they, number one, would sit-in at Howard Johnson [Ice Cream Parlor and Restaurant, Durham, North Carolina], you know which was looked upon as whites sitting there eating all kinds of fancy ice cream and what not.  And one of the brothers said, "I just want to see how that ice cream taste sittin' at the (laughter)"--it was some exciting times you know.  And they pulled it off, and although it seemed to be small it was--had a huge impact because it was blacks participating in just a, just a simple thing like eating a bowl of ice cream.  Where people could come from a whole public, unless you were black, and sit down and eat ice cream.  You know Howard Johnson was famous for variety, you know all kinds of famous kinds of ice cream that you could eat, but we couldn't go there because we were black.  And so--that means a lot too 'cause you know children, for instance, they'll worry you to death about an ice cream cone or eat ice cream, see they can do that now.  And so you look back--and the library itself, which was a public library, but the blacks couldn't use it.  It has now become a historical site and people come from all over to visit that library in Alexandria, in Alexandria.  That little library has now become a memorial site because it was made open--public library should have been public all along.  People can't realize you had to, you had to go through a session like that in order to get the use of the library, and you encouraged your children to read and study, but if you can't go to the library, what--where are you going to get the material to read and study?
Story_ID: 191726
Speaker 1: And Ms. Rolark, if you will, tell me a little bit about an organization that you founded in the '70s [1970s], the National Association of Black Women Attorneys [NABWA].  Why did you think it was necessary to create such an organization?
Speaker 2: Well, to me that organization did a great job in defeating the notion that to be a lawyer you had to be a man.  Which is sexism, because next to racism, sexism is a very bad thing, I think and so that was my motivation in doing it.  Because everything that we were doing in law was headed by a guy, you know, and there are plenty of smart women lawyers too.  And so it was formed and we formed it after a meeting at the National Bar Association held in--I think we were in Detroit [Michigan] that year and it was controversial.  'Cause see some of the fellas didn't like the idea of forming it, why'd you have to have two of them, you know.  They have The [National] Bar Association as well as the National Association of Black Women Attorneys, why you need both?  We need both to show that women were just as proficient as men in runnin' and managin' an organization like that, it had become very well-known and it's very active and I'm just semi-retired now so I'm not that active in it, but it meets when the Bar Association meets. It's quite a good organization.  And it has inspired quite a few young women to take law.  That was the other reason for doing it.
Speaker 1: And what do you think it's like for women lawyers today compared to what it was like for you when you started?
Speaker 2: It's much different, yes indeed, much different.  For instance, now you have women lawyers with president of the National Bar Association.  Not, the National Association of Black Women Attorneys, but the big Bar Association itself.  Women have run and have become the officers, in fact they have a woman president now and one of the first presidents came from Detroit.
Speaker 1: And what was it like when you were, when you began your law career for women?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't think about that, I was just thinking about winning those cases that I had.  But, it was tough, you know, it was tough for women, all of them white, black, you know--primarily a man's field.  But now you have women judges, in fact you've got a woman member of the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  And, you have chief judges, who are women, like Chief Judge [Annice] Wagner here in the District of Columbia she's chief judge of our Circuit Court of Appeals here.  Excellent judge too.
Speaker 1: And when you look at how far women, more particularly African American women have progressed in terms of the field of law and you were there blazing the trail, how do you feel?
Speaker 2: I feel good about that.  I feel very happy about that because I think it's a field that, you know, it's like anything else, if it's opened up like that it gives, say girls when they go to court--when they go to college, and take up a career, they can look upon law as not only to practice, but you have women judges now, you have women chief judges, you know black women, a chief judge.  As I said, over there in our circuit court you have Judge Wagner, she's our chief judge there and you have them in Superior [sic, Supreme] Court.  You have black women who are judges and chief judges of that.  And it gives them something to aspire to, you know, and it gives them a real good motive for carryin' on and stayin' in school and preparing their children, you know, for different vocations.
Story_ID: 191727
Speaker 1: And in addition to women in law you've also been very active and instrumental in ensuring that young people have access to getting a law degree.  Tell me about some of your work in keeping UDC Law School [The University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law, Washington, D.C.] open.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that, you know that was quite a fight there.
Speaker 1: About what time frame was that?
Speaker 2: I think it was about ten years, about twenty--about fifteen years ago wasn't Joe [Joseph Elam (ph.)]?  The law school at UDC?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah because there was quite a bit of contention that why would you need another law school because you had Howard [University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and you could go to the other law schools and so forth.
Speaker 2: So, tell us about that?
Speaker 1: Well but you see UDC, the university, to make it a complete university the thought was that you should be able to go to law school there, medical or whatever, nursing, just a complete university, which it is now.
Speaker 2: So tell us about the struggle and the fight to keep it open.
Speaker 1: And to establish it (laughter).
Speaker 2: And to establish it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a pretty tough fight.  I remember when the issue came up on the Council of the District of Columbia.  You know, 'cause it was legislative, Hilda Mason, who was chair of that committee, the committee on education had that issue.  And I remember it was a real tough issue because some of the members of the council were not going to vote for it because we had Howard Law School and we had other law schools in the city.  And you know it was always a matter of economy, you know, when you're doing a budget.  And, I remember that John [A.] Wilson, an you remember John Wilson--late John Wilson who was former chair of the council and myself, well they'd get into that meeting, it was at the committee of the whole because we were not on--I was not on the education committee, he was because he was chairman of the council but the committee of the whole all of us are members of that.  And we walked in and that issue was coming up and we saved it.  If we hadn't come in those two votes put the issue into law to establish the law school.
Speaker 2: And why was.
Speaker 1: 'Cause some people were pushing that you had Howard Law School you don't need another law school.
Speaker 2: And why did you think we, we needed two?
Speaker 1: Well, number one, University of the District of Columbia was a public university and therefore it'd be more economical and more open to everybody who wanted to do it to go.  That was the key right there.  Once you put it, once you put it at UDC it, it became public like, you know.
Story_ID: 191728
Speaker 1: And we had began talking earlier about some of your work with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], let's talk a little bit about the United Black Fund [Inc.], tell me about that and how it came about.
Speaker 2: Well, the United Black Fund was quite an issue.  Because it grew out of a struggle that involved black seniors, the United Way [of America, later, United Way Worldwide], at that time, had denied admission, you know in order to come up as one of their agencies--
Speaker 1: What time--about what time frame was this?
Speaker 2: I guess it was about twenty-five years ago.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  It was 1961 [sic, 1969].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anyway, the United, the United Way denied admission to the Start-Up Baptist Home, which was an agency of the United Givers Fund.  It was not the United Way at the time, it was the United Givers Fund, because they did not have the proper auditing set up, they didn't have the staffing and all the rest of it and here were these black seniors who would be deprived of the--excuse me--funds that could come through the United--The United Givers Fund.  And I remember certain community leaders like Doug Moore [Reverend Douglas E. Moore], my husband Calvin [Rolark] and the rest of them got together to form the United Way--I mean the United Black Fund, so that we could have a fund of our own, you know to fund our own agencies.  And I remember that made that very powerful statement that you would have a black fund, and I could hear Calvin now saying you could use black banks, in other words the thing just wouldn't be charity itself, it would be sensitizing us as natives as to our power.  What we could do on our own because of course the Start-Up Baptist Home would have been without funds because there was no agency that would fund them.  Now when we were--when we formed the United Black Fund, we couldn't just form like that, we went to court.  I filed a lawsuit, I was the lawyer--chief lawyer for that and used the issue of discrimination, you know, because we were entitled to participate.  And we were being denied this participation because this was a black group that was being denied this participation because according to them they weren't qualified.  They didn't have the type of auditing set up and all the rest of it.  And so we formed the United Black Fund and they became one of the first agencies and been going ever since.  And now, you know, recently the United Way has come under some questions, but we have been out there all this time ever since, the formation of it, which we're quite proud.
Speaker 1: And tell me about some of the work that the United Black Fund has done?
Speaker 2: Well it has thirty-some agencies and it formed--it allows agencies that would not have been able to get into the charity fundraising business to get into it and to be able to survive.  Not only the Start-up Baptist Home, which was senior citizens, but it has--we have an array of agencies, thirty-two in all, and we supply and fund a number of needs that make the communities more receptive and more able to serve the needs of people out there who need that money.
Speaker 1: And over the years, how have you seen the needs change?
Speaker 2: Well the needs are bigger than ever now (laughter).  Because you see the needs relate to the, to the, what's happening in the communities and the communities are in great need now because of--well the economy is down and when the economy goes down of course.  Agencies like food, you know, and like education all the rest of it suffer for the lack of funds and they can get them now.  And we're very active and we have a particular emphasis on youth.  And one of our main issues is our youth and you know our youth is in trouble.  They're, they're--when we formed the United Black Fund, there was a time when blacks, young blacks had become very depressed about their ability to survive.  Because there was a lot of killing going on, you know a lot of killing going on and I remember him saying, when you see youngsters planning their funerals and trying to describe what kind of casket lining they would have, the girls blue and the--the girls pink and the boys blue, that's a sad time that young people, instead of concentrating on living would concentrate on how they were gonna die.  Because they didn't see how they could survive.  And so that was one of the main things when he [Calvin Rolark] did the opening statement for forming it, he said, "This should be their time of life to live and to live aggressively to help themselves and their communities.  Not to die, not to plan their funerals," and that gave a lot of impetus to what we were trying to do.  Because it was sad to see youngsters stand up, like the girls say, I want pink for my shroud and the boys say they wanted blue or they wanted purple.  You know it was just sad.  They weren't talkin' about living, they were talkin' about dying.  And they're teenagers like eighteen and nineteen and seventeen.  It was incredible.  But the formation of this group had a lot to do their changing of their perspective and wanting to live you know.  And now, that's one of our most popular programs the young people who participate in that program go on.  We have one of them who's doing an excellent job that's now working for us.  He's going to the University of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.], one of the best speakers you'll ever hear.  He was suicidal at the time that he, you know, during that time because it was nothing he said, over there where he lives, which is one of these big projects there were killings every week and he didn't have nothin' to really look forward to, Victor, Victor Armstead.  But now he's at the University of D.C. as a business student and is doing very well.  And an excellent speaker so when we use him as our--in some of our presentations, he can say that because of the nature of our organization it gave him the will to continue to live and now he can be of a great benefit to the community because he's accomplished and he's interested in trying to do something to keep young people goin' the right way.
Story_ID: 191729
Speaker 1: When you look back, you know, over your life--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and all of the young people that you've helped whether they're young female attorneys, attorneys, young people, how does that make you feel and what are you most proud of?
Speaker 2: Well I feel very good about that, you know, I like community participation in any way.  And now, there comes a time when the black seniors are catching it, you know, and we have a program, it's a small program now, but it's growing very fast.  It's called, Call a Senior because there are sometimes, you know, when people have to get a certain age, never hear from anybody, they're home alone, they might be by the phone but nobody calls.  This program allows them to now that there is somebody interested in them and it can save a life, because if you live by yourself you get a certain age you can't take care of an urgent--if a tragedy happens to you at your house even though you may have the bracelet but a lot of people don't have those bracelets that they talk about.  But if you're called by somebody and if you need help, you can, so it's Call a Senior.  And the group that we have, and we're trying to build on it every day, they know they can look forward to these calls.  Call a Senior, it's a very, very, popular program.
Speaker 1: And when you look at some of the changes that the city has undergone what are your biggest concerns about the future of Washington, D. C.?
Speaker 2: One, well, number one, you know, is our ability to stay here in the city of Washington, D.C.  We're--if the rents escalatin' and jobs disappearing that sort of speaks for itself.  And there're certain areas like you take this ward, ward eight, that are being impacted by new comers who have money and who are able to pay some of the high rents that now exist because you get a lot of condos that are being built.  They have great plans for St. Elizabeth's Hospital [Washington, D.C.], they're going to have some big condominiums but they're going to cost a lot of money.  In other words, in other words, in order to live you've got to make a lot of money and so that's a great concern of mine.  Our ability to survive in the capital of this nation, and part of that is because we don't make the money, we can't pay the rents, it's hard to survive.  And a lot of us are trying to work on that now.
Speaker 1: What about home rule?
Speaker 2: Well you know, home rule--the late Julius Hobson (laughter) he was very creative in his use of language.  He used to call it home fool, that we had home fool.
Speaker 1: What is home rule?
Speaker 2: Well I said home fool, but anyway, the home rule would be the ability to govern yourself.  And of course you know we are mainly governed by congress because everything we do our laws and everything have to go up there for final approval.  And unless we meet with their approval some of those laws are not going to make it and we are trying to get full home rule but it depends on who is headin' up those committees up there at congress, whether or not we'll get it.  Now we have a very eloquent representative up there, Miss [Eleanor Holmes] Norton, but you see she can't even vote, now when your own representative doesn't have a vote on the floor that's very sad.  So, we're talking about full participation and, and governing yourself and inspiring your children but you've got to be able to fully participate.  And we still can't do that here, we still workin' on it and she's workin' very hard on it.
Speaker 1: Do you think it will happen anytime soon?
Speaker 2: I hope it will.  I'd like to think ahead.  I like to think, you know, in a, in a way  that feel (unclear) at it, but it becomes difficult and that's what makes me sad when I hear young people say it doesn't matter whether or not you vote.  It matters a lot, now here you are pressing to get home rule, which means that you can vote and you have your coming up generations saying it doesn't make any difference, there's no need for me to vote, to register to vote 'cause what difference would it make?  Makes a big difference, a very, very big difference and that's what I preach to young people all the time, please register and vote, don't just register.  You know, because, you then become somebody that will be taken into confidence by them, you know they'll respect you for it.  They like to hear you say it doesn't matter if you vote or not 'cause you know they don't have to fear you.  You can be feared on issues when you exercise your right to vote it's a very important right, makes you a whole person.
Story_ID: 191730
Speaker 1: --Throughout your political career as well as your community activism you've had the opportunity to work with several different mayors here in the city [of Washington, D.C.].  Can you tell us a little bit about them and who you enjoyed working with most and that kinda thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I wouldn't say most because I enjoy working with somebody that has power.  Of course, some people are more aggressive in using that power.  But our very first mayor, Walter Washington was very good in two respects.  He was not only aggressive; he knew also how to walk a little middle path there to get things done.  He was very good to have as the first.  You know he was first appointed and then he became elected.  Currently, we have Mayor [Anthony A.] Williams who is working to do a whole lot of innovative things and, it's just, it's difficult because we don't have certain rights ourselves as citizens and so we have to really and truly work with Miss [Eleanor Holmes] Norton who is our present representative on the hill to try to bring some things to pass.
Speaker 1: What was it like working with [HM] Marion Barry?
Speaker 2: Well you know Marion Barry, he was the mayor and you had to work with him and--when I think of Marion Barry I think of [David A.] Dave Clarke.  Because Dave Clark was chairman of the Council [of the District of Columbia] and of course a council has a lot of power because it pushes the legislation, it was very good working with Dave.  A lot of times Dave and the mayor didn't agree, but I was on the council so I had to align myself with Dave and then when Dave went up, went away from us, John [A.] Wilson became the chair and he was very aggressive, he was a great chair.  And you know, of course he had a very bad end, he killed himself.  But while he was there he exercised that power.  And, because Marion was very aggressive, you had to have somebody who can use that power and David and John Wilson both used it very well.
Speaker 1: Under Marion Barry's tenure there was somewhat of a dark shadow cast on the city with the cocaine incident, what were your thoughts on that when that first happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm going to bypass that one.
Speaker 1: Okay that's fine, and, and tell me a little bit about--
Speaker 2: 'Cause when I was on the council, he wasn't--that didn't happen, you know it was afterwards.
Speaker 1: But, do, do you want to talk about it just as a resident and as a community activist here in the city?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What your thoughts were?
Speaker 2: About what?
Speaker 1: When that incident occurred?
Speaker 2: What incident are you referring to? I don't know what you're talking about.
Speaker 1: The incident with Marion Barry?
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: The one with the crack cocaine on the video tape.
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) I'm not going to talk about that.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 191731
Speaker 1: What haven't you done yet that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I have to be like [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, you gotta keep hope alive (laughter).  I gotta keep hoping we can get some of these things to come to pass while I'm still here.  It's difficult, but as I say one of the main things isn't hard, which is to encourage young people to do the main--the thing that they can do, which is to register and vote.  And to think that you've still got to go out there and literally beg them on your hands and knees to exercise something that people all over the world are dying to get the right to do.  It's almost unbelievable that they're not out there vigorously participating to help Miss [Eleanor Holmes] Norton get some power on the Hill [Capitol Hill, or the U.S. Congress, Washington, D.C.] so that we can improve the quality of our lives.
Speaker 1: Do you ever think what your life would have been like had you pursued a writing career?
Speaker 2: No I don't but I know I have been able to write a lot because I wrote a lot of legislation.  I wrote that way.  So, I still did the writing, you know, 'cause you had to compose those laws and it would have been completely different if I had written like that.  So, I don't really concentrate on it because life is difficult anyway trying to energize your block.  Now, it's hard to energize your block, luck--I'm very fortunate in that my block is 100 percent votin' block.  Where I live 500 block of Foxhall [Washington, D.C.], all of us always vote.  That's one thing I have preached ever since I have been on that block.  One thing you can do you can register to vote and vote.  And so we are, you know, loud and everything else on my block when it comes to--I say it can go on a block by block thing if every block did that, you know, we'd be more highly respected down at the Hill because it would show that you're interested in getting the vote.  But when you have young people standin' there saying it doesn't make any difference that kinda' cast a shadow on what you're trying to do as a community.
Speaker 1: And we have seen some effort underway to really encourage and entice young people to register to vote, more particularly Tom Joyner what he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, on the TV--on radio.
Speaker 1: --what do you think about those kinds of efforts?
Speaker 2: I think those efforts are very good.  I admire and respect them and I also admire and respect churches and besides--because you see black people are church going folks and if you get preachers, preachers who are active, you know, there ones like SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], but I mean in your individual churches, if you get like Reverend Willie [F.] Wilson, Union Temple [Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.], he's very active in that.  He even ran for office and you have my pastor, Reverend William Smith [ph.], he emphasizes the fact that this is something you got the right to do, you should exercise it, you know 'cause there was a time we couldn't vote and so we just don't ever want to forget that.  Now that's something that you fought and bled for, use it.
Story_ID: 191732
Speaker 1: And what advice do you have for people who are interested in either a career in law or politics, what advice do you have for them?
Speaker 2: Keep on pushing, that's my personal motto, you got to keep on pushing in that, you can't give up or give out because you don't see the immediate results of what voting will do, but I think anything a big effort along those lines will help the whole city, I really do.
Speaker 1: And when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you?
Speaker 2: Well, number one I had a very good--very successful and for--and good marriage with Calvin [Rolark] and we didn't have children but I was able to get a daughter though Calvin one of my step-daughters Denise [HM Denise Rolark-Barnes] who's a very brilliant girl and doing a very good job in writing, she is writing for a living and so I'm very proud of her.  And, the young people in the family, I'm encouraging all of them to go to school.  What I'm preaching now is you've got to get educated just like it was when I was coming up almost now.  Because kids droppin' out of school, can you believe that?  They'll go to the third year of high school and drop out.  Knowin' that they can't get anything without an education, so that's the thing that I'm concentratin' on now, now more than ever you've got to encourage kids not only go to school but stay in school.  And stay in there and finish so that they can get a career and make not only themselves better but their communities.  I, I never thought I would live--at this part of my life and have to, you got to get out there and literally beg children to stay in school, it's sad.  At twelve o'clock, you should come out here at twelve o'clock some days and see all these young people standing around, they're not in school.  And so you see, that's trouble for them, but it's not future for them and if they get married or if they get a family, and a lot of them are having children, what do those children have to look forward to?  That concerns me more than anything else at this point.  The less--the fact that education is not emphasized--used to be that blacks as a group were so proud of their children going to school, I mean when I was coming up it was just considered an honor that you had a child that was going to finish like high school.  Now, it's almost an honor if you get a child to stay in school (laughter), beyond elementary school.  You should come out in some areas, around noon time and all you'll see hanging on the street are young people.  They should be in school or working, they're just hanging and then you read the other statistics, I don't need to go into them.  About murders, about drug arrest, about prisons, all of them--we wouldn't have any of them grim statistics if we could go right back as they used to do in my day, they'd emphasize education, you got to get an education 'cause once you get an education it opens your eyes and I really don't think people focus on education like they should.  To me, that's the main thing, it may sound like the past, but it's the present, we've got to keep these--first we've got to get these kids in school and then keep them in school and second we've got to get people representing us who give sufficient money to the schools so that you can pay the teachers and get good heads of the schools.  Education that is really just going back to [W. E. B.] Du Bois and all the rest of them, the brilliant people in our past.  You can't beat education, education is it.  And that's what I would like to make one of the key emphasis of what I'm talking about now, and it's easy to do.  The schools are public; you don't even have to pay to go there.  These kids are dropping out before they finish high school.  It's sad, it's real sad it actually makes me very, very sad when I see it and whenever I see it I stop and talk to that person.  I guess they'll let me talk to them about it because of my age, but I don't know whether I can convince them or not.  But I say, you know you should be in some school takin' up somethin', that's what I feel.

Speaker 1: Ms. Rolark, at some point you were able to pursue your writing career, tell me a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you very much for asking me that because I was able to get to it during my political career 'cause Calvin [Rolark], in fact it was Calvin who suggested to me, I believe that I should do a column, you now, for the paper.  And I called it, Checks and Balances, because I know that's what you do in politics, one group push somethin' and another group would check it with somethin' else, so I called it Checks and Balances.  And for the entire time I was on the council [of the District of Columbia] I wrote that column for The Washington Informer.  So that was a long period of time, sixteen nearly twenty years in all that I wrote that column so that was a good way in which to use that desire to write.
Speaker 1: And what was some of the issues you wrote on?
Speaker 2: Oh well any political issue we had, like for instance, rent control was a very hot issue because there was a real determined effort on the part of some of these landlords to do away with rent control and so the, the council was like almost evenly divided.  That was during the years when [David A.] Dave Clarke was chairman of the council and John [A.] Wilson was the--on the council.  We had a very aggressive --and [HM] Sterling Tucker.  And the lobbyists would be down there parading the halls.  It was a very exciting time, you had to hold your, you really had to hold your points you know 'cause they would come and openly offer you money and this that and the other.  If you were for the people you were able to stick to your issues, you know, and so having a column helped because see a lot of people who did--who couldn't look at TV, they didn't follow issues, it was not a long column, it was good, it was like two, two newspaper columns, wouldn't it, wouldn't you say my article was, three, three newspaper columns and it came out every week in The Washington Informer, Checks and Balances.  And a picture ran with it, so it was heavily read.  And you were able to get your points across and that was the type of writing I like because then the media could use writing in order to win an issue or fight against a negative part of that issue and the rest of it.  And so it as a very interesting experience and I did get back to the writing for which I was very happy (laughter).
Speaker 1: What are some of your thoughts on affirmative action?
Speaker 2: Well you now basically I just--my--the type of person I am I think there should be affirmative action, I mean there should be no question, that anyone who wants to get an education the mere fact of the color of their skin or their economic status should not block it.  So all these so called technical points that people are trying to bring up, the main issue is should your race be used against you to obtain a better education, you know, a better job and all the rest and so that law suits are being filed everyday on it and I think--and I have had on the legal side of my life I've had some extremely important cases that did--that dealt with that.  I remember one time there I had a case involving a black woman at the [U.S.] Department of Justice, who wanted a raise and the--it was an issue that was decided on the legal issue of sexism because her boss was black.  It was at the Justice Department and it was Dolly--the Dolly Walker [ph.] case which became a very famous case.  We won the case and she got her promotion, but, affirmative action is extremely important I don't think people should back off of those issues at all.  Some of the affirmative issues are race as well as sex, see, women still have a hard time getting and holding certain jobs and we have to remember that it's not just race it's also sex, women are blocked from a lot of things simply because we're women and not considered as efficient, only I think we're smarter, (laughter) frankly I think that because being a woman I think we're smarter than the guys and then I was raised by a woman who thought (laughter) that women were smarter.  That was my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson].
Story_ID: 190974
Speaker 1: When you look back on your life what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: It's hard to answer that, that--so many things, nice about my life.  I'm like [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, "Keep hope alive."  I've been keepin' hope alive a long time but nevertheless, I think I've had a very fortunate very blessed life.  And, I had wonderful parents [John W. Jackson and Margaret Boykins Jackson] and there's nothing like that, as you well know.  And that's one think that I, I, that's in my heart all the time now is that some children just don't have parents.  They're out there, people just have children and they don't think about the family to help them with raisin' those children.  Literally, like out here [in Washington, D.C.] where we live some children are raising themselves, I see them in the stores, little ones like eight and nine rolling the carriage with their baby sister and whatnot, doing the shoppin' and I think that we owe a duty to help those children have the benefits of a family even if they don't actually have the actual families and that's why you have to continue working on these issues.  You really do have to continue working on these issues, like keepin' them in school because a good parent, she or he is gonna make you stay in school, you know. So they can get their education and be self-sufficient and all the rest.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: To me these are very important issues.
Speaker 1: What values are most important to you and why?
Speaker 2: What values about what?
Speaker 1: What values are most important to you?
Speaker 2: I think everybody--well right--in my mind integrity.  You got to be true to yourself and true to whomever you deem that you're serving.  Integrity's extremely important, that's what I feel.
Story_ID: 190975
Speaker 1: And how do you want to be remembered, what do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well I, you know (laughter) I don't really say what they--I hope I have lived in a way that they would think kindly of me when I pass (laughter).  That would be it, but I think that everybody should find something to do to help somebody else out here.  You know seem--we've got to use that good neighbor approach in life and I think if we do we'll have better communities.
Story_ID: 190976
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Well because history is important because it raises your self-esteem.  Particularly if you're reading the history of your own groups, you know your own life or your own groups, your own families your own communities your own schools.  That's why, you know, they talk about things like school spirit and all the rest of it, that's why they matter to children because you like to have something that you respect that's out there doing something you know, so.
Speaker 1: And why do you think we really need to preserve African American history?
Speaker 2: That's a matter of pride with me and I think it means a lot to kids.  And just look at them, you know look, look how happy they are when your school wins a game, you know, or if you get some student in your school who achieves something, "That's one of my classmates", you know, so I think pride means a lot to, especially young people.  And those things that give you pride and they're accomplishment become very important because of that.
Story_ID: 190977
Speaker 1: And what would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Help somebody (laughter).  I think if more people devoted themselves to helping, even if it's their neighbor, you know, on that street, do something.  They feel better not only about that neighbor but themselves and their communities.  I think everybody can, can go out there and be helpful.  When you have to decide what you want to help, mine happens to be the community and where I live, what my street.  You start with your street, you know.  You're workin' with the kids on the street all the time, you know.  And you know I think children like that and you--when you ask them, "What grade are you in? Do you go to school?"  Now my husband Calvin [Rolark], he was extremely aggressive, he'd go to school as if he were their father or grandfather and that's what I heard one of the boys on the street said one day, "Yeah, you better do that 'cause you know Dr. Rolark, be up--be up to the school too." And because just as if he were related to them, you know, because long years ago in the South the people on your street kept track of you just like your parents kept track of you and we've gotten away from some of that.  And if we get back to it, be your brother's keeper, I believe that.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you want to add Ms. Rolark that perhaps we didn't touch on?
Speaker 2: No, except to say that I think what you all are doing is a good idea because you're preserving something, not just because this happens to involve me, but we don't have those reservoirs of our history available like they should be, see some people, particularly young people don't know--don't even know what black people have done.  And so this will be a reservoir of information.  Whether you agree with it or not, at least it's there that can be used and it shows the importance of preserving certain documents like some of the one's that I've given you it's important to keep records like that.  Records--I remember long years ago my father [John W. Jackson] used to always say that was one thing he emphasized, record keeping.  He said that you should always have some paper--he had a desk and my mother [Margaret Boykins Jackson] used to hate that desk because when you opened it--a roll top, an old roll top (laughter) just about everything would fall out of it, he had so much stuff in it 'cause he wouldn't throw away--and he would wrap it with--so forth, 'cause he said, "This is gonna be very important or this is gonna come up," 'cause he was always like--he was always a keeper of records wherever he was, he was the church clerk, he was treasurer of a lot of these fraternal organizations and he believed in--wouldn't have all these people gettin' in trouble cause he always said, "What's mine is mine an what's thine is thine."  Don't even think about somebody else's money.  And I always remembered that and it has helped me a lot in the field of law 'cause a lot of lawyers get in trouble because if they're appointed a conservator (unclear) they actually use the money, they think they can use it but it's not their money.  And that's what he always say, you never get away from the theory that it's not yours, it's somebody else's an--but you have to take good care of it, so.  I think we have to get back--those values, to me, values are extremely important and those who don't have the parents that emphasize those values should get it through their teachers or through people for whom they work or even just from a good neighbor.  You gotta tell people values are important, really and truly and when you start losing those values they start getting in all this trouble.
