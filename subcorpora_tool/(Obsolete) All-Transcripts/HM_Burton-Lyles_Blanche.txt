Speaker 2: Was Ida Blanche Taylor Burton [Blanche Taylor Burton], she was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] on November 10th, 1894.
Speaker 1: And did she ever talk to you about her childhood, growing up in Philadelphia at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes she did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did she say?
Speaker 2: She and her brother who was the late Dr. Daniel B. Taylor, just the two of them, and my mother was the older.  That she would always watch over him, be very protective, that they grew up in North Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] on Burke Street.  And then later they moved and when my mother married and moved to 19th Street, which is where I still live.  My late uncle had his first office, hung out his first shingle right across the street, he is now deceased, he was the first African American urologist in Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: What was his name your uncle's name?
Speaker 2: Dr. Daniel B. Taylor.
Speaker 1: That was your mother's brother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Brother, exactly.
Speaker 1: Your mother's brother.  And where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: He went to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania], and then he went to Howard medical [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] then he also studied at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], but before he went to Howard, he studied at Tus- he taught at Tuskegee and he was so fascinated and he decide then to go to medical school.  He graduated top of his class.
Speaker 1: Well he was probably one of the first African Americans to go to Penn State?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes and he had won a sports scholarship, he was a great runner at South Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Which was the alma mater of Marian Anderson, 1921.
Speaker 1: So the school is the haven for attracting talent.
Speaker 2: Definitely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In all areas.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What else did your mother say about her childhood, did she ever talk about her parents [Henrietta Taylor and Daniel Taylor] and what they did?
Speaker 2: Yes well my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your paternal grandparents--your maternal grandparents.
Speaker 2: My maternal grandmother she stayed at home and cared for the two children and my grandfather taught himself to read.  He worked in a bookstore, bookbinding store, many, many years ago; and I have one of the books.  It's Robert's Rules of Order that he had bound, it is done by machine now, but they used to sew, the books together.
Speaker 1: So he was a book bounder?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes he was.
Speaker 1: And he taught himself to read?
Speaker 2: Yes, by books.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the company he worked for?
Speaker 2: Winston [J.C. Winston Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], it was on Arch Street, of course we're talking eighty or more years ago.
Speaker 1: Right, but then did, was that, did he bound books for white and black people or were they specifically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, well whoever at that time was predominantly white, I'm sure, and my mother started teaching piano when she was about fourteen or fifteen.  She would leave school, she went to Girls' High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and visited the homes, and that's how she started.  She gained such a wide following.
Speaker 1: White and black?
Speaker 2: Mostly black I would say.
Speaker 1: Now who had taught your mother to play, where did she--
Speaker 2: Ah, she studied with Carl Diton who was quite a composer and Russell Johnson [W. Russell Johnson], yeah, she studied with them.  But she was not a performer, she enjoyed teaching.
Speaker 1: Well how, how did music come to her, how was music a part of her life so early on?
Speaker 2: I think just because she loved it, because her parents were not musical, now on my father's [Anthony Burton] side, his brother, often they say I inherited this from him.  Could play anything he could, would hear, anything.
Story_ID: 534136
Speaker 1: What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father was Anthony Bud Houston Burton [Anthony Burton], Bud was his nickname.
Speaker 1: And he was born in?
Speaker 2: He was born in Camden, New Jersey, December 11th, 1897, and he drove a mail truck; oh, he was in First World War [World War I, WWI].  And I know my mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] was interested in meeting a tall gentleman, 'cause my mother was only 4'9".  He had to love music and have a very good job, and know how to cook, because mother did not cook, so it worked out perfectly, a friend (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He did all of those?
Speaker 2: Friend had a dinner party and they were introduced and they met and they courted for about five years.  And they were married sixty-two years, when my mother passed in 1985.
Speaker 1: So you said your father, father's brother was a musician?
Speaker 2: Yes he was, he was self-taught, but he could play anything.
Speaker 1: What, what instruments?
Speaker 2: Piano.
Speaker 1: Piano as well.
Speaker 2: And so I inherited that ability to be able to, although I'd been reading music since I was three, but to be able to play any tune I might hear on the radio.  Popular tunes so I was often, I played at places such as The Ritz-Carlton [The Ritz-Carlton, Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the Bellevue [Bellevue-Stratford Hotel; The Bellevue Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and the Union League [Union League of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And I never had to buy music for those things because I just hear them on the radio.
Story_ID: 534137
Speaker 1: So as your mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] was playing at fourteen, she started to play (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: Well she--
Speaker 1: --well enough to teach.
Speaker 2: --started teaching, exactly, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now talk to me about her teachers, what do you know about those two composers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Carl Diton was a composer and quite well known and heralded at, in the black community and Russell Johnson [W. Russell Johnson] there is a guild named for him at the National, Negro Musicians, National Association Negro Musicians [National Association of Negro Musicians].  She studied with both of them, piano.
Speaker 1: Now do you know why she studied, was it just a hobby or was it something that she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No because--
Speaker 1: --thought she might pursue?
Speaker 2: --it was something she loved so very much, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did she, she ever think she may pursue a professional career outside of teaching as far as performing?
Speaker 2: No, she just, she was stage, she had stage fright, it never bothered me, because I was so young.  I made my first appearance when I was four years old at one of my mother's pupil's recitals.  She had pupil recitals with more than forty students every year, fifty actually, at a big church.  And I, my first tune I learned was called, 'The Choo Choo Train' [ph.], and so I always loved performing, said I was quite a ham, I had no problem, never any nervousness.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first recollection of hearing your mother play?
Speaker 2: Yes, well I would hear her play because her studio was upstairs, she had a piano up there and then they bought me a grand piano for the first floor.  And so I would often hear her play you know, demonstrating to the students, and so she said, "You need to be on the stage, because you love performing," yeah, so it was the life for me, even when I played Carnegie Hall [New York, New York], I had no fright whatsoever; I walked out on stage and saw the people there.  Now in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] there was an African American orchestra called the Philadelphia Concert Orchestra, and I played for them here in Philadelphia.  And they said it was a sell out, I was only like ten years old at time, I played a concerto, which is a foreword for an orchestra and instrument.
Speaker 1: Wow, that's impressive.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So you're, but your very first, do you remember walking up to the piano at three years old and--
Speaker 2: I don't remember, my mother told me that, it was, just during the holidays and she said, "I just walked up," and she heard this, and she couldn't believe it.  She walked inside; I was just picking out 'Jingle Bells,' 'Jingle Bells.'
Story_ID: 534138
Speaker 1: The family on your mother's [Blanche Taylor Burton] side (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --must've been middle cla- pretty well off for some time, being able to have her brother [Daniel B. Taylor] go to school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] to become a doctor?
Speaker 2: Well, he had a scholarship.
Speaker 1: He had a scholarship?
Speaker 2: Plus he worked on the campus in the dining room and so on; yeah he helped to put himself through.  And then my mother being a little older, she was teaching and she and my dad [Anthony Burton] would send him what they call care packages.
Speaker 1: So was your mother able to teach in formal settings at for at school?
Speaker 2: At home, she no, no.
Speaker 1: She only taught at home?
Speaker 2: She preferred teaching at home, because she said getting up at six o'clock was a bit much for her, so and she taught all day, she had Wednesdays off.  We would go shopping and my dad arranged his work schedule, he drove a mail truck on this large tractor trailer for the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  And he would cook everything before he left home, then he would call back about five o'clock, she said, "Oh, I smell the carrots burning."  Because he (laughter), yeah and so he, he loved it, yeah.  Before they were married he said, "Not to worry, my mother taught me how to cook," oh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: And he made the best biscuits and things like that.
Speaker 1: Go ahead he makes the best biscuits.
Speaker 2: Cakes, pies.
Speaker 1: Cakes, pies.  Who had taught him to cook?
Speaker 2: His mother.
Speaker 1: His mother.
Speaker 2: Yeah his mother.
Speaker 1: What did his mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: His mother stayed at home, I think they were about three children, he was the eldest.
Speaker 1: And his mother's name?
Speaker 2: His mother's name was Sydonia, Sydonia Burton.
Speaker 1: And do you know her date of birth and place of birth (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No I don't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because she passed a few years before I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But your, was are there any connections to the South in the family, had the family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well my mother's--
Speaker 1: --migrated north?
Speaker 2: --family, the Taylors, let me see, were from some parts of Maryland that much I knew.  And my mother's grandmother was from near the Sea Isles [Sea Islands] in South Carolina, I understand, because they were very short, very, very short, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 534139
Speaker 1: And what are you rec- your earliest recollections of mem- of your childhood memories?
Speaker 2: Oh playing jacks, going to school, I loved school, I would help the teacher mark papers, I was always a very good student.  So to keep me out of trouble the teacher would have (laughter) me mark papers, you know of other students.  And then I played for the assemblies from the time I was in the first grade, and they would come into the assembly, I would play.
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of your, just being around the house at home with your mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] and father [Anthony Burton]?
Speaker 2: Ah the wonderful smells from the kitchen, my dad cooking, mother teaching and often on Sundays, we always ate together every Sunday.  Because my dad went to work around two in the afternoon, didn't get, didn't get home before eleven o'clock at night.
Story_ID: 534140
Speaker 1: And what street did you live on, the first house you can remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Where I'm living now.
Speaker 1: And what, tell me--
Speaker 2: 1118 South 19th Street [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], it's the family home, although I moved away for a mon- a while lived in a very swanky high rise.  But as my parents [Blanche Taylor Burton and Anthony Burton] grew older, I moved back home to care for them, so there's no other place I would be.  It's roomy, spacious I've had closets built and it's safe, they had iron bars put up from the time I was five years old (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now describe to me the neighborhood itself, what it was like back then when your parents were living.
Speaker 2: Back then it was, it was sprinkled blacks and whites, we all got along very well.  And there was a music teacher on the next block who was a close friend of my mother's.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Romeo [ph.], yes and her daughter and I still keep in touch.
Speaker 1: Was she black as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes she was.
Speaker 1: So there are two music teachers in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And did lots of students come to study music at the time, was it popular to study (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, and almost every child had a piano, which is a rarity in some houses today, they may have electronic keyboards.  But you had a piano, there was, there wasn't a block that didn't have a piano, um-hm yeah.
Story_ID: 534141
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of being influenced by music, you know the feeling (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because I heard it all the time, 'cause my mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] was teaching Chopin [Frederic Chopin] the other things and exercises and then Marian Anderson was a part of my life.  Because my mother grew up with her and played for the church choir when they were teenagers, so it was just a naturally, a natural situation.
Speaker 1: Do you remember going to Union [Union Baptist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the church?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: What are your, what's the youngest, your youngest memories-tell me about it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We sat in the balcony, we always sat in the balcony, we had a special seat in the balcony.
Speaker 1: Talk to me about the church the makeup of the church, the choir, the music department, the supposedly outstanding--
Speaker 2: Oh many years ago we had a large choir, couple of, several choirs and my dad [Anthony Burton] sang bass on the choir, and my mother was playing the organ which is still there, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you?
Speaker 2: And I would often play a solo sometime, in fact I still do when they have special Sunday, Women's Day, I'll play during meditation.  Because as I always tell people you must be versatile, I play hymns, spirituals, do a little jazz and of course the classics and the show tunes.  And you have to, to survive yeah.
Speaker 1: What were they playing at home; you said there's always music, what was the music at home?
Speaker 2: At home, well we had a lot of the old recordings you know the 76 [76 rpm record], where they--78s [78 rpm record] rather, 78s and so all of the classics, Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven], Chopin, mostly piano music, some orchestras.  I heard it all the time.
Speaker 1: So you were influenced by classical music--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --very early on?
Speaker 2: Very, very early, and then we would give, every concert Marian Anderson had at the Academy of Music [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], we were there.  And we went save for a whole year, concert at the Academy of Music and where are seated now is where Miss Anderson lived.  Which she purchased in 1924 and she would have guests here after the concert, and she'd have my mother bring me after the concert and I would play for her guests here.
Speaker 1: And what did she have you play, what music would you play?
Speaker 2: Generally classics, and Chopin and Schubert [Franz Schubert] and maybe a little Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach].
Speaker 1: So she was so willing to show you off?
Speaker 2: Oh she was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And take care, nurture your talent--
Speaker 2: Oh she was, I was, it was just marvelous, but it was just a natural progression for me.  And these two houses were connected that panel over there which is a little bolt.  That was the entrance to the house next door, which is made like this, has the same staircase, except they have pillars in the living room.  So that they would use the kitchen on this side, it was larger and they would cook on the other side.  And the guest would be downstairs, did you notice hardwood floors, it's quite a complete room, and they would have food down there and up here on the other side.  And Miss Anderson would be back and forth, chatting with the peop- yet people like Edward M. Greenfield [ph.].  Freddie Mann [Fredric R. Mann] for whom the Mann Center of the Performing Arts [sic. Mann Center for the Performing Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] is named, and there was an African American legislator, Crystal Bird Fauset, she was present also.
Speaker 1: And you remember being at these parties and performing for them?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I remember those, yes.  I'd have a big bow in my hair, I wore Shirley Temple curls and I have the socks to match the dress with the ruffles you know on the little lace on the anklets.
Speaker 1: Were you ever nervous about performing?
Speaker 2: No, I loved, it, I love performing (laugher).
Speaker 1: So I read that she called you Little Blanche [HistoryMaker Blanche Burton-Lyles].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes she did.
Speaker 1: And why that nickname?
Speaker 2: Well because I was very thin as a child and then, you know I was a little girl 'cause from the time I was eight, she would have me come up to the house and play for her guests.
Speaker 1: Now how did you meet her, I know you that you went to the same church.
Speaker 2: Well through my mother because she would have my mother bring me up when she'd be in town, and she would ask, "How are things in school?"  That of course and she honored me by recommending me to the Curtis Institute of Music [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: When did she hear you playing for the first time to know that you played well enough (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was probably six or seven I believe.
Story_ID: 534142
Speaker 1: Do you remember playing for her [Marian Anderson] for the first time?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh (laughter) it's just like I hopped up on the stool you know.  And so my mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] teaching at home had been my teacher for eight or more years, so she told my mother said, "She needs more advanced training."  And Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] is strictly scholarship you cannot pay, and I was there eleven years.   So I'm just indebted to them that I had the opportunity of studying there on unlimited scholarship and I was the first African American woman pianist to graduate from Curtis, and to receive a degree.
Speaker 1: Well eleven years of studying, that's very long time.
Speaker 2: And even after that, then before Curtis, I studied with a Mr. Leo Ornstein, he lived to be 109 I think.
Speaker 1: And Mr. Ornstein had a school [Ornstein School of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: That's right, um-hm it was on, 18th Street at the Art Alliance program [Philadelphia Art Alliance, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And what year would you have stu- what year did you study (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, that was in the '40s [1940s] (unclear).
Speaker 1: In the '40s [1940s].  So was he, was that your first professional training outside of your mother's professional training?
Speaker 2: Basically although I did study with Mr. Edward Hutchison [ph.] who was a very fine pianist and teacher.
Speaker 1: And how did you get to him from?
Speaker 2: Well new my mother.
Speaker 1: He knew your mother.
Speaker 2: Right after my mother I, within oh not more than a year.
Speaker 1: So he knew your mother how?
Speaker 2: Through her recitals.
Speaker 1: Through (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother was well known for her music.
Speaker 1: So your mother gave recitals for all the children--
Speaker 2: Every year, yes.
Speaker 1: --and all the children came together then people would come to hear the talented children?
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So kind of like what you're doing now with Marian Anderson and bringing the children here [Marian Anderson Historical Residence Museum, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Similar yes the difference is that we mentor them, we're able to give that that personal attention that you would not get from a teacher or a school.  They call us and one young man he says, "I have to get to Kennedy Airport [John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York]." He was one of our first scholars, Issachah Savage, he's a Philadelphian.  Finished Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], incredible tenor, he's on a tour of London [England] now like six months, he's at Catholic University [The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.].  And I said, "Not to worry," so my fingers do the walking through the Yellow Pages and we found a vehicle that picked him up at his home at North Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and delivered him to the gate at Kennedy.  Other times, they have to rent music sometimes the scores are sixty and eighty dollars, and sometimes for the young ladies we'll help purchase a gown for them.  One young lady was going to sing at Wigmore Hall, which is like our Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] in London, so we had two gowns made for us.  I then when you hit the stage before they hear you, they see you.
Story_ID: 534143
Speaker 1: We were talking about you performing your music.  But we're gonna go back and talk about some of your mother's [Blanche Taylor Burton] students (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --because you said that you are still good friends with them today.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: So if you could mention them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I shall.
Speaker 1: --and just about the experiences of them coming to the house and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: --and being taught by your mother.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Well Trudy Pitts from my early recollection, and she lived nearby her mother was a beautician.  And so she and my mother were friends, and after our lesson, after the lessons, we would play jacks if the weather was warm.  And if it was sa- we loved to come on Saturday, because my dad [Anthony Burton] didn't work on Saturdays, he would make biscuits and cakes.  And we'd have biscuits and jelly and biscuits and honey, and I as I said often played jacks or jumped rope, we were playmates.
Speaker 1: What were you, was she, you were both being taught virtually at the same time?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And was there any ever talk about music, I mean did she study classical music as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: As well as jazz?
Speaker 2: Yes she, she studied classical music, she didn't, didn't do jazz 'til she was at the conservatory, she sort of branched off and she went to New York [New York].  And they asked her to sing, she said, "I don't sing." They said, "But you have to sing," (laughter). That's how that came about.  And she's traveled all over the cruise ships and Europe, an organist, she does more piano now, she's an outstanding organist, incredible.
Speaker 1: Did she ever play at the church [Union Baptist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I don't remember which church she attended but she probably did.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then what about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jackie Beach Faulcon [Jacqueline Beach Faulcon], yes the same way her father [HistoryMaker George Beach] used to bring her, 'cause they lived in Nicetown [Nicetown-Tioga, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and, as she grew older, I think she'd come by herself.  And we had the same wonderful times together and you know playing, and just girl talk, just giddy (laughter).
Speaker 1: So but there are three fine musicians being taught by the same--
Speaker 2: Yeah, how about that.
Speaker 1: --teacher, and that's your mother.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now Jackie has her Ph.D. She finished Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] then West Chester [West Chester State College; West Chester University, West Chester, Pennsylvania], and she's been at the Wilmington [Delaware] music school [The Music School of Delaware] more than twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: What type of a teacher would you say your mother was?
Speaker 2: She was stern but very fair and she always had a long pencil, we used to get them in Atlantic City [New Jersey].  Because as I said being short, she would lean back in that very Windsor chair you see in, in the living, in room.  And she would say, "That's wrong," and I keep, I'd say, "I tell you that's the second time that's wrong, and the third time that pencil (unclear)," (laughter).  They always remember that.  And they sometimes would strike, and I put one in her casket (laughter), she would love that.
Story_ID: 534144
Speaker 1: The same as with as my dad [Anthony Burton], I put the bass, the drum--what do you call it? The drummer, the beater for the drum. 'Cause my dad played the bass drum in the post office band, so he was a musician also; he sung bass on the choir.  And he was the first bass drummer they had in the post office band, he marched with them in the (unclear) parade.
Speaker 2: Well he was the only African American in the, in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well they wasn't band, they would, what would they call it the Elks [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks of the World], the Elks band um-hm, that was the early on, yeah.  But they would have black band you're right, I think that was around the '30s [1930s] I'm told (laughter).
Speaker 2: So do you remember seeing your father?
Speaker 1: Oh yes few times we went we stood in the, got to be too cold and there were people on Broad Street [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] who knew my dad and they would let us stay, stay inside you know look out the window.  Oh yeah, we'd wait for him to come by.
Story_ID: 534145
Speaker 1: What would you say was the role of music in your life at this time, because you're surrounded by, your mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] teaches you, you see your father [Anthony Burton] marching.
Speaker 2: Well it's totally relaxing, it's inspirational and I used to play down at the gallery, 8th [Street] and Market [Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] every Monday.  And people would come by sometimes, they'd give me a rose or something perhaps I had played a spiritual; someone had passed in their family.  And they would come back the next week and let me know, so that is my ministry basically, um-hm.  I do the classes but I, as graduate--oh when you're not in a music school, you're able to put yourself into, as far as improvising.  And music at the time of Chopin [Frederic Chopin] and Paganini [Niccolo Paganini] was improvisation, lot of people don't realize it.  And so I do this on some of the things that I perform, I'm able to do that with the freedom that you don't have when you're a student.  You know every note must be the way it's written (laughter) they would call me the female Liberace (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 534146
Speaker 1: Now would you say, did you, you feel your mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] recognized your talent?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes she did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did she recognize the talents of Trudy [Trudy Pitts] and Jackie [Jacqueline Beach Faulcon] as well?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, definitely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there other, other students that she thought were talented (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah there are a few others, in fact one gentleman is a holistic doctor, Dr. Frederick Burton, no relation.  Yes, she taught him and he finished Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and his son is a musician now.  Yeah Dr. Frederick Douglas Burton, she taught him also.  There is one young man if he didn't know his lesson; he would go right out the kitchen door and over the fence (laughter).  I remember him well, and my mother used to give you a, a mark in stars, big gold star, that was excellent.  You got a medium gold, you got a smaller gold, if you got a blue star you were almost afraid to go home.  And if you got a red star (laughter). So there was one girl, she was clever enough, she bought herself some stars. And, but she made the mistake in bringing them back, my mother said, "I ain't give you this star," of course underneath was a blue star over the gold star (laughter).  Then mother would give prizes, cash prizes at her pupil's recital, she'd, I'm talking about in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s].  She was giving out a couple hundred dollars in prizes for those who had the most gold stars and also those who sold the most tickets.
Speaker 1: Did you ever win that contest?
Speaker 2: Well I, no, not I wasn't involved in that (laughter) I was just her pupil.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I thought it was very enterprising; it was encouraging a lot of, that way she would get new students for the next year.  Because they would want to compete for these gold stars and tickets for, one boy and girl I think sold more than a hundred tickets.  And it was always at a church, first Thursday in June.
Speaker 1: So it's kind of like its own 'American Idol' competition (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes exactly, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: People were--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and then they would try to see who would get the biggest bouquet or basket of flowers (laughter) and the florist loved to see that come about.
Speaker 1: So who were some of the other early students, can you remember other names?
Speaker 2: Let's see offhand I can't there are so many, I see a lot of the free, they would come up to me and they tell, and I say oh yes, I remember.  And but they were all friendly, it was just a nice combination of young people.
Story_ID: 534147
Speaker 1: So how did you move beyond your mother's [Blanche Taylor Burton] training into, for her to --
Speaker 2: Well after I studied with the--
Speaker 1: --let you go off and study with someone else?
Speaker 2: --Ornstein [Leo Ornstein] because she knew I needed more you know.
Speaker 1: It was recognized that you--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were called a child prodigy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Prodigy, yes 'cause I was playing recitals, not one of my mother recitals but I have my first recital when I was seven.
Speaker 1: And how did that come about, who organized it?
Speaker 2: It was in church in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and they wanted to present me in recital um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now when you're in a recital like that do you have a conductor or you just play the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No I--
Speaker 1: --music.
Speaker 2: No, I just played solo.
Speaker 1: Play solo.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, you might do a group of three numbers and then you leave the stage and come back and do three, then you have intermission, then you come back and do another, and of course the grand finale you always leave the most spectacular number for the last number (laughter).
Speaker 1: And who help to come up with the numbers, who was in charge of putting the mu, the program together?
Speaker 2: Basically my mother.
Speaker 1: So it's your mother who was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: --putting you out front--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and putting the music together.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So how did you get into the school, into?
Speaker 2: At Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: No, not Curtis the Ornsteins, Ornsteins.
Speaker 2: Oh, (unclear), they were recommended and they were outstanding (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) By whom, who recommended them?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure but they, someone, you know told my mother, "You want her to have one of the finest teachers," you know.  So I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now was that a different part of town that you had to travel to?
Speaker 2: No, Center City [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], right there.
Speaker 1: Center City.
Speaker 2: Are you familiar with Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: No but explain it to me (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was Center City, Rittenhouse Square, actually only half a block from where Curtis is.  And it's still there; it's an art gallery now, the Art Alliance [Philadelphia Art Alliance, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], that's what it was always called.  And the Ornsteins had the top floor, the third floor for their studios.
Story_ID: 534148
Speaker 1: So continuing and talking about Ornstein's school [Ornstein School of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that the school that you saw racism for the first time?
Speaker 2: Yes and it wasn't from the music school itself, actually it was the elevator operator.  We got on except when he let us off my mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] said, "This isn't the studio."  He said, "No I thought you had come for a job and had brought your little girl," (laughter).  So my mother stood up to all of her four feet, nine inches, she said, "My daughter is a student of Mr. and Mrs. Ornstein [Leo Ornstein and Pauline Mallet-Prevost Ornstein], and it's the third floor," (laughter). Yeah, it was quite interesting.
Speaker 1: Was that your first time experiencing any racism in?
Speaker 2: Basically yeah, I had no problem in school, one time a little, one of my closest friends in elementary school.  And, and we were doing something--she always liked some of my lunch, I said, "You have to bring you own lunch."  She called me an unpleasant name, and I slapped her, so my mother had to come up, she said, "Yes, I told her anyone who calls her that name, to slap," (laughter). She said, "And she'll do it again."  And that we were, remained very good friends (laughter), but she had obviously heard it in home, at home and she didn't know.  That was expressing her anger, she didn't know the meaning of the word, you know.
Story_ID: 534149
Speaker 1: So just to going back before we ended (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were telling me the breakdown of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], how it's broken down the different sides and the groups of people that lived in that particular part of town.  And you were telling me that that was Center City [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] downtown.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's Center City where the music school is, was and it's half a block which is Rittenhouse Square from Logan Street.  Where the Curtis Institute [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] adjoins the Bell- The Barclay, The Barclay hotel [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now is the, what part of Philadelphia is con- is there a black neighborhood and a white neighborhood and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes let's see--and this neighborhood is becoming mostly white because the, what do you call them the hip, not hippies, what do they call them?  The upwardly mobile--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Yuppies (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yuppies.
Speaker 1: Yuppies, they moved here, lot of professionals and this street, the cheapest house is three hundred thousand [dollars].  Miss Anderson [Marian Anderson] paid six thousand for this house in 1924 (laughter) and I bought it in '98 [1998], I paid less than seventy [thousand], but he didn't know it was her home.  He did not know it was her residence, see, and this is most interesting, in the '30s [1930s], Marian Anderson owned seven houses on this block.  And that's rare any color, but she would buy one house and then mortgage and then buy another.  Because a singer, professional singer, she was considered self-employed, so she had no pension to look forward to.  So she looked ahead and realized and the farm in Connecticut was more than one hundred acres.  That was ah, that was a gold mine, because I'd say after about twenty or thirty years, she would sell off several acres.  Because she had no health insurance and her husband [Orpheus H. Fisher], in whom she was married for forty-two years was sick the last eight years of his life.  He had had a stroke, was bedridden for awhile, so that was costly, so she sold off some acreage.  With the stipulation she be allowed to live there all of her life, she had the two acre portion.  And so that was quite valuable to her, her nephew he sold it I think in the '90s [1990s], early '90s [1990s] just before she passed.  And but the money was there to care for her, she lived very handsomely, very, not opulent.  Like the home she had was a ranch that her husband built in the '50s [1950s], had a two car garage and she didn't travel with an entourage the way these young people do you know.  They have to have a bodyguard at their side; you know she would get (unclear) just to have lunch at the Crystal Room [Crystal Tea Room, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with just another friend.  And ride the regular elevator and people would gasp, we're talking about the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] I mean, she was in her heyday.  And they would just, "Oh, that's Marian Anderson," she'd say, "Yes, I was when I left home."  She had a dry sense of humor (laughter).
Story_ID: 534150
Speaker 1: Tell me about the time that she [Marian Anderson] recognized your playing and suggested to, to your mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] that you--
Speaker 2: I think it was while I was coming here to play for her guests, and I was playing Schubert [Franz Schubert] and so she said, she, "Do you wanna think about further advanced training for her?"  And so my mother said, "Well we have limited amounts, but if you can make a sug- ." That's when she suggested Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  She said, "She has the ability, take her," she said, "and I will recommend her," so.
Speaker 1: So you went into Curtis on her recommendation?
Speaker 2: Recommendation, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the audition?
Speaker 2: Yes, clearly, because my teacher who would be my teacher at the time was one of the judges and so she said, "Now when you hear the pencil tap, you stop until I give you--." And so by mistake she dropped the pencil, and I stopped, and she said, "No, go ahead," but what impressed her she said I took up the next note, I didn't go back, I didn't start the next measure.  She thought that was quite unusual (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: And who was the teacher?
Speaker 2: Madame Isabelle Vengerova, she was considered one of the best in the world, she came from Russia.  And the week when they would teach, they would stay next door at The Barclay hotel [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and oh it was such a thrill to be able to carry her briefcase to The Barclay.  And--
Speaker 1: What was her teaching style?
Speaker 2: Well it was known as the singing quality, people would often ask, I say, "No, I don't sing, my fingers do the singing."  It was a technique that you didn't just strike it, although it's a percussion instrument, but it was a manner in which the tone was always so sweet.  And I've become more aware as I say in later years just what she was talking about.
Speaker 1: A finesse sort of.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: A way in which you.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: You feel the music.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, but in the way you approach it so that when that tone came out all you could, you know, it would resound.  So I always try to think that, and anticipate what the audience is going to hear.
Speaker 1: So she, you begin studying with her--
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-three [1943] until '55 [1955] actually 'cause even after I graduated Curtis, I still went over occasionally to see her.
Speaker 1: Why did you, I mean you were learning more than music I'm assuming to be there for eleven years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, as a full music conservatory and that I had languages there.
Speaker 1: What languages?
Speaker 2: Italian and French, and I also had theory of course, I studied with, you may have heard of Dr. Voclain [ph.] who was one of the great, he taught at the University of Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I think he just died recently.  And George Rochberg the composer he taught let's see, I had theory, no, counterpoint I studied with Dr. Voclain, theory with Dr., Mr. Rochberg, Dr. Rochberg, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other students that you befriended?
Speaker 2: Well Gary Graffman who was the director for twenty years, we were there at the same time, for a while he commuted from New York [New York] and then he was there, he's on my board of directors of my society [Marian Anderson Historical Society, Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and a very close and true friend.  Anna Moffo, who just passed recently the opera singer, we graduated together in '54 [1954], and about ten years ago she sent a beautiful glossy picture of herself and Marian Anderson at the White House [Washington, D.C.] in 1968.  I don't know, that's upstairs in the case.  Let's see who else--Anna Moffo, oh there were several but those two come in mind there most famous Leonard Bernstein.  But Leonard Bernstein had graduated from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when he came to Curtis.
Speaker 1: And the composer Gianni Carlo?
Speaker 2: Menotti [Gian Carlo Menotti], yeah he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Menotti.
Speaker 2: He was a teacher he taught there.
Speaker 1: He taught, he taught there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm yeah he taught (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did he--
Speaker 2: --composition, but I didn't--
Speaker 1: --did you study--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You didn't have any composition classes?
Speaker 2: I didn't study composition.
Story_ID: 534151
Speaker 1: So during that time, can you give me, can you sort of describe for me the feeling of the school, was it?
Speaker 2: Oh the feeling of the school was wonderful, I mean you--it was United Nations, they were there from all over.  Germany, Sweden, Italy, South Africa, now there many more Asians there now, it's about 45 percent Asian, um-hm yeah.
Speaker 1: And at that time it was a small percentage?
Speaker 2: Yes very, yes very small.
Speaker 1: And what percentage of it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because they weren't living here at that time as much.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you were the only black student?
Speaker 2: I was the only black pianist; there were a couple of singers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were they?
Speaker 2: All of them deceased, Louise Parker, Theresa Green [Theresa Green Colman] she was a soprano, and Louise Parker was contralto, and she had difficulty because her voice sounded so much like Marian's [Marian Anderson] and Marian was still concertizing, she had a great voice.  Let me see who else, now they have several in the string department, chal- I know it's a bass player from Atlanta [Georgia] is there, and there's a clarinetist Gill [ph.], I can't remember his first name, his brother was there.  And often people would ask Marian, they ask me, "Why aren't there more blacks?"  They don't concentrate as much and it takes a lot of concentration, when I was at Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I was up at six [o'clock] in the morning.  I would practice an hour before I went to school, then when I was in junior high; the principal was kind enough to give me a special roster.  So I could be at Curtis from one to five; that is, I did not take cooking, sewing or gym or, you understand, they were afraid I would hurt my fingers, so I just took the majors.  History, English, social studies, math (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Math.
Speaker 2: Yes, so I left school every day at twelve o'clock.  It was down South Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And what's school were you going to at the time?
Speaker 2: At the time it was the Furness Junior High [Horace Howard Furness Junior High School; Horace Howard Furness High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is--I got the bus it was about twenty blocks from home.  And I'd come home and change, sometimes I would walk to Curtis, see I was only twelve or thirteen, you understand.
Speaker 1: Now were you going to a black school and then to Curtis (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No it was a mixed school, it was mostly white.
Speaker 1: That was mixed--it was mixed also?
Speaker 2: Right, at that time.
Speaker 1: Oh it was mostly white school?
Speaker 2: It's now a high school, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 534152
Speaker 1: So how did it feel to be so many firsts, I mean you were the first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It didn't bother me at all because my mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] and dad [Anthony Burton] always said, "You can do anything, the Lord has blessed you with a talent." She would always say, "Just behave," (laughter). 'Cause I talked a lot all the time.  "And you'll have no problem." And as Miss Anderson said, "Let your music speak for you."  See, Marian Anderson was unlike Paul Robeson, as you heard on the video, and although she admired his talent, but they couldn't perform together.  Because, see then she would have been under that shadow that he was under, and he was very, very outspoken, and that's why they took his passport from him.  He died of, of a broken heart in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], but Marian Anderson they, they said she didn't protest, no.  But she, I think it, Miss Phyllis [Phyllis Sims] probably told you, that she, Josephine Baker and Paul Robeson decided they would not give two concerts; they would give one, you know.  And what was unique, and they didn't even know it was happening with this vertical line, they could sit on the left or right side.  Top or bottom, you understand and those who weren't accepted it became more acceptable.  And I think because, she, he was not submissive, she was saying, "When you open your mouth," like when I would go to play at different places, "you don't have to say anything, you just sit down."
Speaker 1: What other advice did she give you as her being your mentor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --early on?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember that in particular, because we had gone to Connecticut; this was after I had played at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York].  And it was the New Haven Symphony [New Haven Symphony Orchestra], I was going to play at Yale's Woolsey Hall [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], (unclear), and this lady who had this mansion was going to be our hostess.  And I was to stay there, my teacher had gone the day before, so we were in the cab when it was winding this driveway so my mother said, "Now, just be prepared to smile," she said, "but here comes racism again."  Because when she, my teacher didn't think to tell what I was, you know, I was one of her fine students.  And the lady, she just turned red, I can just see or, I can't explain it, and so we went up, when we got to the top of the driveway Madame [Isabelle Vengerova] was with her.  She said, "Oh, I'm so happy you're here my dear, but I have some guests coming, but I have a wonderful Jewish doctor and his wife who'd be only too happy to have you, because they have children," so forth and so on.  So my teacher, not being aware of what she, she said, "Darling you didn't tell me you," she said, the guy said, "you didn't tell me you had guests coming."  And so the next morning I had rehearsal that afternoon at the hall, and the next morning after I played, they gave me a standing ovation. And who was the first one backstage arms open (laughter)? And she had the reception at her home, but she didn't want us to stay overnight (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: And who was in the audience at Yale University (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Yale well, there was, it was a Young People's Concert, so it was young students.
Speaker 1: Were they predominantly white students?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were they all white students for the most part?
Speaker 2: Mostly yeah, although I think they did go to what they call the inner city for some students.
Speaker 1: Were you re- aware of, of race at that time, like all the students are white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes you had to be.
Speaker 1: --that she was going to?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 534153
Speaker 1: Did Marian [Marian Anderson] ever talk to you about her experiences with it, being that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, she didn't talk about them, you know this, like the incident at Lincoln Memorial [Washington, D.C.]; she said, what--that it didn't happen.  She said, "We don't talk about it anymore," and the family never talked about it, she said, "It never happened." But she was a good one for it to happen to because she, the way she handled it--understand, because that day, that Easter Sunday, 1939.  And it was selected because black people dress up or Easter, at least they did then.  I don't know if you noticed the hats, the men wearing the hats and the coats and dresses, everything new.  Now Easter Sunday in April of next year, we're gonna have a concert, I think it will be at the art museum [Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Revisiting Marian Anderson at the Lincoln Memorial, we're gonna have the concert of the same numbers.  We have six or seven singers; she sang seven numbers, three spirituals an aria and so on, that will be, and we're gonna be playing, I don't know if you heard the tape downstairs, you'll, that--when you hear Howard Ickes' [sic. Harold L. Ickes] voice, and we're gonna recreate that.
Speaker 1: Did you ever accompany any, or were you just a soloist?
Speaker 2: I was strictly a soloist.
Speaker 1: Strictly a soloist (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, occasionally I played for a couple of our singers, if they're just doing one or two numbers, I knew, you know some of their repertoire.  And yeah our singers are quite remarkable.
Speaker 1: You're proud of them.
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: We're gonna get to them, don't worry (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh we just came back from Sacramento [California], you would not believe they just, that girl just did her, debut as Aida, they went wild like when Leontyne [Leontyne Price] made her debut as Aida. Yeah, so out there we got the--got special rates Phyllis [Phyllis Sims] is great on that computer.
Story_ID: 534154
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you go to Temple High School [Temple University High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what year did you enroll into class (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was in the '60s [1960s] because once I had, it was in the '60s [1960s]--how did that work? No, it was earlier than that.  Because see I graduated Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in '54 [1954] and with my degree, but you could not have an appointed position in the school system.  Because Curtis at that time was not accredited, now it is of course, liberal arts, et cetera.  So, but the high school as I say, I went I think it was in the '60s [1960s] it must've been and I graduated from Curtis in '54 [1954].  And I did some concerts, you know tours, in the southern colleges and then I--well Temple High was for those who wanted to get their high school diploma.  I took four years of state board exams for English and they had a, and that's one of the pictures in the white cap and gown that you saw.  Those pictures Phyllis [Phyllis Sims] is bringing back, my high school graduation, they had at the church you know.  And then I took courses at night, I didn't take the full course at Temple, 'cause they recognized and accepted all Curtis' music credits, so I took sociology, things like that.  And went afternoons and evening and the next year in '54 [1954] I gradu- my diploma which is nice, my picture's on, two pictures at (laughter) in their gallery.  I received my diploma one year and the next year I had gotten enough credits to get my degree from Temple, I only went like a year and a half at the most.  But because I didn't have to do any music courses (laughter).
Story_ID: 534155
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, were you the first in, I mean the Philadelphia Concert Orchestra (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --was the first and only African American--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: --orcha- orchestra?
Speaker 2: And they haven't had one since in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Now wh- did you know them, did you know them personally (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah my godfather was the conductor, but most of them all had jobs, they worked in the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] and different places.  But they rehearsed at the Y [Young Men's Christian Association], they were very well trained, and they would have, this building is no longer in existence, called Town Hall [Scottish Rite Temple] in Philadelphia.  They had cello soloists and so on but I was the youngest and the only pianist and they just couldn't imagine--the first violinist came out hold me by the hand (laughter). 'Cause I was very tiny, I looked much younger, they thought I was like eight years old, I was about ten or eleven.  And they had not heard that you know, a young black classical pianist playing with an orchestra, because the Philadelphia Orchestra had never had anyone.  And I think Leon Bates was one of the few blacks who played with the orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra.
Speaker 1: So you're, you said your godfather was the conductor.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What's your godfather's name?
Speaker 2: Raymond L. Smith, yeah.
Speaker 1: And where did he train, who trained him?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, he played violin. I remember then he decided he wanted to have an orchestra, it might a composer who I believe the story had Henri, (pronunciation) Henri, H-E-N-R-I, Alcone [Henri Alcone (ph.)], he was assistant conductor, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now they were all black?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They were all black, did they, had they all trained in the Philadelphia area?
Speaker 2: Basically yeah.
Speaker 1: Basically.
Speaker 2: Yes they were Philadelphians.
Speaker 1: And they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But they all had other jobs; few if any were playing just performing.  Now Booker Rowe, who is with the Philadelphia Orchestra like thirty-five years he was in the orchestra, and a couple others.  There're only three blacks in the orchestra--
Story_ID: 534156
Speaker 1: So as your career was developing--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Miss Anderson's [Marian Anderson] career was--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in its heights.  What connection did the two of you have, how often did you see her, and?
Speaker 2: It might be once a month, depending if she would come back [to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], because she always came back here first, then she'd go to Connecticut.  See she had the home in Connecticut which they got in '42 [1942] the farm and her husband [Orpheus H. Fisher] lived up there.  Somebody else get it mixed up and said that after she moved up there in '42 [1942], but she still kept this house.  And the last time she came here was in '91 [1991] that was when her sister [Ethel Anderson DePreist] who lived next door passed.  She was the one who was the mother of the conductor Jimmy DePreist [James DePreist], and I watched Jimmy grow up.  Jimmy's now at Juli- no, at Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York], in the conducting department.  But he's never been here (laughter).
Speaker 1: So during that time, you said that she, you saw her once a month?
Speaker 2: Possibly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Possibly.
Speaker 2: Yeah my--
Speaker 1: Possibly once a month.
Speaker 2: Might be more or less depending on her schedule--
Speaker 1: As a mentor, what was she doing for you that once a month, what was her contact with you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, just talking you know general, and she knew how to ask certain questions. I would say to--what I was doing, and what were my plans.
Story_ID: 534157
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were your plans?
Speaker 2: My plans were to be a concert artist exclusively, but it wasn't practical as my parents [Blanche Taylor Burton and Anthony Burton] said, "That's why you're going to get your degree from Temple [Temple University High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (laughter) so that you can have that foundation.  That you know you--if don't have a concert, you're still gonna eat." 'Cause my dad said, "'Cause you know how you love to eat, you like to eat well," (laughter).  And so I, it was the best advice because it's because of my career as a teacher that I have this property and the birthplace, you know.  'Cause see I have a pension and social security, and then, and I have a couple of properties which I purchased now.  'Cause they would just sell, I had a lot and I believe it sold for more than a house it's near where I live on 19th Street [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And so all of that helped in the later years which many people suffer and you know to have the things to be able to do what I want to do.  And as I say, 'cause all the expenses except for maybe two or three months of the mortgage for eight years, eight hundred dollars.  Including the thirty-five dollars for the burglar system came out of my personal funds, 'cause our organizations they, they might have three hundred dollars (laughter), the gas in the wintertime is like two hundred dollars, even though you're not here every day.  Electricity, water, now the birthplace I have the electric, I mean I had the electric was on but only if you turn the lights on, that was very low.  But I had the gas turned off at the birthplace.
Speaker 1: Because there's no one there to use it, right?
Speaker 2: No not only that, plus as if no one here to use--but there, I keep this on but I had it shut off because few people went there in the winter.  In the summer you didn't need it, but I had the water on, that's a lovely, it's a smaller home.  It only has well one big room and a very small kitchen, front bedroom and the middle room, that's it.
Story_ID: 534158
Speaker 1: So you were, you experienced another bout with racism or you can tell me what it was when you tried so many times with the Philadelphia Orchestra (unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: And Young People's Concerts series.
Speaker 2: Exactly I tried three times and the last time was the final time because one of my teacher's students--very good student from Lima, Peru very, very wealthy.  In fact when Ormandy [Eugene Ormandy] who was a conductor at the time the orchestra traveled to South America, he stayed at their mansion, you know. They had like the (unclear) in Lima, Peru and so Madame [Isabelle Vengerova] just told her to go down--I'm trying to remember how it happened.  I was in the finals, this young lady didn't take the audition, they had her come and play in the finals, and made her the winner.  And 'cause my teacher said, "Let's go down and hear Blanche [HistoryMaker Blanche Burton-Lyles], 'cause I know she's gonna be the winner," she just knew it.  Madame said, "It's not possible," (laughter). She couldn't believe it.  And William Smith who was the assistant conductor at the time, this was the third time, said, "Oh you were outstanding, you were wonderful.  But just come back next year," and I said, "Well, but Theresa [ph.] didn't take it." He said, "Well you see," the Ormandies stayed at their place.  So that was just sort of a favorite, this happens all the time, like you may hear about different young people whose parents are in politics or something and someone does a favor, so that person gives that person a scholarship.  And this is what it is the very, very wealthy.  And she just cried, she says, "This isn't fair," she said, "I know you were the best blah, blah, blah," and all that, and she could not understand, being from South America.  So my mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] said, "You don't have to go back, you've already played at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] with the New York Philharmonic you don't have to prove anything."  So I remember Miss Anderson [Marian Anderson] said, "That's right," she said, no, "There's sometimes you beat your head against the wall, it isn't worth it, for what?"
Speaker 1: And you played at New York [New York], at Carnegie Hall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Earlier.
Speaker 1: --earlier, you'd won the--
Speaker 2: The youth--the national competition, I don't know if you saw pictures upstairs.
Speaker 1: So that was the nationwide.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What year was that concert?
Speaker 2: Ah it was in the '40s [1940s] believe it (laughter) it or not, yes.
Speaker 1: The '40s [1940s] okay. So who--
Story_ID: 534159
Speaker 1: Who entered you into that concert?
Speaker 2: Well my teacher at Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], 'cause I was still at, at yes I was still at Curtis, I was right in the midst of my learning there.  And she says, "I think you have a good chance," and so I went and made the finals. It was on WQXR [WQXR Radio] broadcast station in New York [New York].  And Miss Anderson [Marian Anderson], there's a write-up upstairs, Miss Anderson invited my mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] and me to come here to hear the finals that had been taped.  It was a record player in the corner you know a floor model right in that corner, in fact there's a picture of this house of her sitting there in '51 [1951]. Phyllis [Phyllis Sims] has it somewhere.  And she said, "Well I want us to hear it together," and we thought, but that's when we heard it--oh I was, and so mother, mother she winked at me, you know, not to get too excited (laughter).  She said, "She's a child," of course I was probably sixteen something like that, and then I heard that and the winner is Blanche Henrietta Burton [HistoryMaker Blanche Burton-Lyles] of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Well there was this Jewish lady, she kept saying, "But you heard my daughter, she was out--." They said, "Yes, she was.  But Blanche is number one," (laughter) 'cause that was the pride, you know, that was oh, it was in The Bulletin, which was the paper at the time, New York Times [The New York Times]. I was in Musical America, which was like the bible of musical magazines.  And it said, "Young colored girl from Philadelphia winner, the first ever," (laughter), yeah.  And Madame [Isabelle Vengerova] was right there in the audience, "Yes, she's my student," (laughter) she was very proud, very, she was just so sweet.  But she, after about three years she told my mother, "You don't need to come to the lessons anymore because your pressure's going up."  'Cause she was very, very stern and mother, she said, "No, Blanche understands and she can write it down," she said, "but mother, you need to stay home," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Who was very stern?
Speaker 2: My mother.
Speaker 1: Your mother was very stern, so she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no, no, no, my, my teacher.
Speaker 1: Your teacher was very stern.
Speaker 2: My mother used to go to my lessons, and she would write down, she would say, "She's going to have to remember on her own, stop writing." So she allowed me to have a notebook when I would go on my own, you know. Uh-huh, but (unclear)--
Speaker 1: So your mother was encouraging you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, always--
Speaker 1: --all along the way.
Speaker 2: Whenever I, she just, "Do your best, just do your best, um-hm. 'Cause you know what you're doing that's why you're up there on the stage and they're in the audience," oh yeah.
Story_ID: 534160
Speaker 1: I played for a church for about twelve years.
Speaker 2: Union [Union Baptist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, no the minister's son had a church further down, I played for him, I was with them you know twelve years, only missed two Sundays, can you believe it?  But I was confined, every Good Friday every holiday, Easter, Christmas, New Year's (laughter).  And I played with the society artists; we were the only blacks on the mainline you know these country clubs that was interesting, I enjoyed that a lot.
Speaker 2: Because you traveled through, throughout (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --with them.
Speaker 1: Oh yes.
Speaker 2: And what was some of the places you hit in that?
Speaker 1: The, the DuPont Country Club in Wilmington [Delaware], Greenville Country Club, also outside of Wilmington, Philadelphia Country Club [Gladwyne, Pennsylvania], Overbrook [Overbrook Golf Club, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania], Huntingdon Valley [Huntingdon Valley Country Club, Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania] (laughter).  And it's so funny, they would always, "Oh you sang so beautifully," no see I was the only woman in the group, there were six of us.  I said, "No, I did not sing, you thought I did."  "Yes, you did."  "No I didn't." One man said, "Lady she didn't sing," (laughter), but they see a woman you know 'cause Ella Fitzgerald, most of the singers were women, and they were with bands and the singers, the soloist you know.  Carmen McRae, people like that Sarah Vaughn, Sarah Vaughn used to babysit for Miss Phyllis [Phyllis Sims].  She's been around jazz people all her life, Carmen McRae, I met Count Basie, Duke Ellington.
Speaker 2: Did they come through here?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Or you met them on the road?
Speaker 1: I went to different places where they would perform, yeah where they were performing, here, yeah.  Count Basie and (background noise) Duke Ellington--
Story_ID: 534161
Speaker 1: When Miss Anderson [Marian Anderson] was doing you know, prior to the war [World War II, WWII], she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --traveled throughout Europe--
Speaker 2: Yes she did.
Speaker 1: --and did a lot of work over there.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you looking at her from afar in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --in admiration?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was able to watch I think it was a television or the radio said, "Miss Anderson is due to perform two or three, four thousand in such a such a country."  Until they closed the gates, you know, Eastern Europe, Germany and I saw a play about her and this was a fact.  She was at the border and they had taken her passport, and she said, "We must get home." "Well, who are you?"  Well you know what she did? She clasped her hands and started singing (laughter) and the guard was in tears, he said, "Here take your passport, go, go, go."  She was with her accompanist, it was a focal point.
Story_ID: 534162
Speaker 1: We were just going to talk about classical music and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --influences. Who were your influences? Because it's not that many African Americans playing classical music.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Your popular music, jazz music, but classical--
Speaker 2: Yes. Well, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --music.
Speaker 2: Well the first African American that graduated from Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was George Walker, Dr. Walker more than fifty compositions and magnificent composer and pianist.  So he was an inspiration to me also, as a pianist, because as you said there just weren't that many.  And we were breaking ground and people had not heard of, had never seen this before.  Now there were many singers, I mean back in 1800s there Adeline Pat, Patti [sic. Adelina Patti] I think was her name, Adeline--Elizabeth Greenfield [Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield]. These ladies had sung in Europe and some but no pianists, you see, even though the first keyboard as such was made in Africa you know.  The xylophone I had one of those, the gourds underneath, give it resonance.  So it was quite unusual but I always got very good reception wherever I would play, and that was the good part about it.
Speaker 1: So how difficult would you say it was for an African American in classical music?
Speaker 2: Well you first of all if you wanted a music school that was scholarship is very expensive, you had to have a patron or sponsor.  Now I know one gentleman, Freddie Mann [Fredric R. Mann] was his sponsor so he sent him to Europe he didn't have to work, he just got engagements.
Speaker 1: Marian [Marian Anderson] had a sponsor.
Speaker 2: Yes, she did, Rosenwald [Julius Rosenwald Fund] was a competition she won, she went to Europe, then after her money ran out she came back and won it again.  Yeah, so she had sponsors.
Speaker 1: Did you have any sponsors or strictly scholarships?
Speaker 2: Strictly scholarships yes see the scholarship at Curtis that was, that was (laughter)--
Speaker 1: That set you up for all of your yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean it's one of the most prestigious schools.
Speaker 2: Exactly, whatever you are in the world, when you say Curtis (laughter) and there's some many oh, so I say 45 percent of the conductors or the first chair instrumentalists are from Curtis.
Story_ID: 534163
Speaker 1: What do you consider to be your first professional concert?
Speaker 2: I had had several, most of them were at churches, oh I had a wonderful one it was in the '70s [1970s] and that was at Friends Select School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  It was an organization they sponsored me it was--that was wonderful event (unclear).
Speaker 1: But do you consider, what do you consider to be your first?
Speaker 2: My first was when I was seven years old, the church was in West Phil [West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], it has another name now, but it was around 56th [Street] and Vine [Street], the church.  And that I remember vividly because it was my first solo recital, so the people there were all there.  They say the interest in the curiosity basically was always there and--
Speaker 1: And what did that audience look like at the church was it all black?
Speaker 2: I'd say 95 percent.
Speaker 1: Ninety-five percent?
Speaker 2: Yeah just about.
Speaker 1: And the white people who came how did they hear about it?
Speaker 2: Well people from my daddy's [Anthony Burton] job and then my, my mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] loved shopping where she bought her hats, she made sure they knew what was going on.  So sometimes some of the sales ladies would be there, and or the shoe store, you'd be surprised they would very supportive; they would come out evenings to hear Little Blanche [HistoryMaker Blanche Burton-Lyles] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Little Blanche.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What did your peers think?
Speaker 2: Oh they, they were, they were proud, I believe they were proud they were always so tickled, you know they would say, "Yeah I'm a friend of Blanche, I'm going to learn to play the piano like Blanche (laughter)," something like that.
Speaker 1: Well what did you think about your talent?
Speaker 2: Well it was a natural for me, was not something I had to, what you would stay study hard for.  Now there were some people who had to study hard to memorize, it was never a difficult time for me.  Often my teacher would give me maybe eight or ten or twelve page numbers or maybe scherzos, Chopin [Frederic Chopin] and when I would go to my lesson the next week, I would put the music on her piano.  And she would say, "You've learned it already?"  I say, "Yes, Madame [Isabelle Vengerova]," (laughter). So those are some things that some pianist, or lot of musicians struggle with, memorizing.  Some of them may have to do the scientific way it goes from this key to that key, I guess I'm wired differently (laughter) I just knew I could hear it in my mind.
Story_ID: 534164
Speaker 1: Were you aware of any other black pianists that were women at the time, like the woman who was at, at Howard University [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Natalie [Natalie Henderson Hinderas]?
Speaker 2: Yes Natalie, she was, she gave concerts there, yes we were friends, we were friends and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because you came, she was about what six years older than you?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes she was, and she would say how one time she went all the way to California thought she was going to do this marvelous composition, commissioned for her this gentlemen Gennis Terris [ph.] from South America.  And when they saw her, first looking at her they thought she might've been a Latino, they had her do Gershwin [George Gershwin].  And suppose she hadn't been prepared, so she suffered racism in that way and it, it really gnawed at her, it bothered her physically.
Speaker 1: Did she ever, she talk about it with you?
Speaker 2: Occasionally um-hm, but she had changed her name so it didn't sound, her name had been Henderson she changed it to Hinderas so it was not an American name.
Speaker 1: Hinderas, did she change that so the people would think she was Spanish as opposed to?
Speaker 2: Possibly, I guess she thought it might open more doors.
Speaker 1: Did it?
Speaker 2: Not really because at the time she went to California I know she expressed she said, "To think I went all the way out there.  Prepared this concerto and they felt I should only play Gershwin."
Speaker 1: Did she ever sit in with your mother [Blanche Taylor Burton]?
Speaker 2: No, no she didn't.  She was from Ohio, her mother was a piano teacher.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So she went to Oberlin [Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But she ended up here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at some point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly yeah she came here and she did very well, and she married here, her husband [Lionel Monagas] was with Channel 12 [WHYY-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] he was a very fine producer.  They had a daughter [Michele Monagas]; her husband was from some parts of South America but the strains of blackness you know.
Speaker 1: You may have been too young for Hazel Harrison but do you remember Hazel Harrison?
Speaker 2: Yes vaguely, yes, yes oh my goodness I haven't heard her name in so long, yeah.  Was she from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: She, I, I know she ended up in Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hazel, Hazel--okay.
Speaker 1: --the piano department.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I don't know where she was from originally, but she was born in Indiana [La Porte, Indiana].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And she, I know she lived in Washington, D.C.--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for some time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember the name Hazel.
Speaker 1: But she and she taught at Howard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I've heard of Hazel Scott don't forget 'cause she, we know she was jazz but I admire her, I used to go see her at the Dell [Dell Music Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. She would play with the orchestra.
Story_ID: 534165
Speaker 1: When did you get your first opportunity to play with an orchestra?
Speaker 2: Well when I was ten or eleven the Philadelphia Concert Orchestra um-hm, they said they didn't know anyone else who could play classics and not needed music and be turning the pages.  Because when I played like forty pages long um-hm, and it was just, it was unique, it was unique.
Speaker 1: How would you say that, I mean, I mean I know the black community was proud of you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and everyone knew you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and they were somewhat responsible for your success you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know early on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah basically from the beginning surely churches.
Speaker 1: --in the beginning.
Speaker 2: That's the way Marian Anderson started, and that's why this recital in February is gonna be at her church [Union Baptist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Her birthday celebration concert featuring our wonderfully talented scholars.
Story_ID: 534166
Speaker 1: So talk to me about your years traveling, I mean you graduate Temple University [Temple University High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in what year '50 [1950]?
Speaker 2: No, Temple was 1970.
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So it was in '54 [1954] you graduate from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: From Curtis.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I subbed, you know, a bit, I couldn't become appointed because I had to have these credits.
Speaker 1: These credits, but that's the same year Brown versus Board of Ed [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, how about that--
Speaker 1: --schools were desegregated.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm and I recall visiting some schools and there'd be some of the students they would say, "You're the first black teacher we've had."  There was a place in Kensington [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] it was an assignment for about a week or two so someone said, "Walk near the curb, don't walk close to the houses."  'Cause they would throw a bucket of water out on you (laughter) and we're talking about the '60s [1960s], late '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] um-hm.  A bucket of water (laughter) so they got so they would see me, that's when I knew I had to get a car.  And a lady said, "You're a teacher up there?" I said, "Yes, ma'am, I teach music," (laughter).  And then when I would travel to give concerts at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] my mother said, "Now remember, you're going below Washington [D.C.], just say yes, sir and no ma'am."  And I know they had, you know, colored and white waiting rooms, so I remember I stood out there with my umbrella.  So the ticket taker he said, "You must be from up north, girly." "Yes, sir," (laughter). Yeah, I used to change in Greenville to go to Atlanta [Georgia] I remember.
Speaker 1: Greenville, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, to go to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Now, how could he tell you're from up north be, what--
Speaker 2: Because I didn't go in the colored waiting room (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, you just stood outside?
Speaker 2: With my umbrella, in the rain, about twenty, half an hour, I don't know what it was, yeah, and then when you went in the stores, you couldn't try on any clothes.  It was like (unclear) I said, "I'm from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]." I was gonna get a hat.  I said, "I can't bring it back," (laughter). Yeah, yeah.  The restaurants, the same way as you saw it and they, see these young people aren't aware that they had, they can't comprehend, they've never experienced it.  It does something to you, but when you know somebody said it was not that way everywhere you know.
Speaker 1: What does it do to you?
Speaker 2: Well it makes you feel offended that someone is, I mean the reason is just so irritating and so stupid.  I mean, like you have green hairs on (laughter)--your skin's another color, and then they get confused when they see--for instance the Olympics I think brought into focus the fact that there're blacks all over the world.  You remember the French ice skater, she didn't speak English, she was adopted by a French--but she was, was born in France.  And then there were other countries that had black athletes, but the Americans they're narrow vision, they were not aware.  And you have to know, but you have to have a self-awareness because with some it just defeated them, they just gave up any of it you know.
Speaker 1: What do you think of was that kept you going?
Speaker 2: I had a belief in myself; my parents [Blanche Taylor Burton and Anthony Burton] developed that belief in myself, that all I needed was the opportunity.  You know, suppose I hadn't gone to New York [New York] to take the audition for the New York Philharmonic, I wouldn't never known the joy of walking on that stage at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] (laughter) you know, and see my name outside as soloist, for the New York Philharmonic.
Story_ID: 534167
Speaker 1: You were the--how did you, the talk we didn't cover that part yet, you playing with the New York Philharmonic.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 1947.
Speaker 1: And how did that come about?
Speaker 2: The audition, and that was the, that was the prize.
Speaker 1: Oh so it was the New York Philharmonic that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --played with at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I thought those were two separate occasions.
Speaker 2: No that was one occasion.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was one occasion so that was the opportunity you got to play with them.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That was, how well, how did they treat you?
Speaker 2: Beautifully, yes, they were just so astounded (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were there any other black musicians in the orchestra (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.
Speaker 1: --at the time?
Speaker 2: They don't have that many now, they may have two (laughter) no, no, no, they were all European, they were European.
Speaker 1: Well did it, have any, did it resonate with you that you were the first black pianist that at Carnegie Hall?
Speaker 2: I knew I was the first but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that Marian [Marian Anderson] had been in the first black singer?
Speaker 2: Exactly, and she was the first to sing with the New York Philharmonic I believe.
Speaker 1: Right, correct.
Speaker 2: And then she sang with them at the, the stadium, Lewisohn Stadium [New York, New York] and guess who conducted it? Leonard Bernstein.  I think it was in '36 [1936] something like that.
Speaker 1: What conductors have you worked with that you worked with?
Speaker 2: Well, Rudolph Ganz was the conductor when I appeared, I haven't played with that many orchestras, but it was Rudolph Ganz at the New York Philharmonic.  He was from Chicago [Illinois], he was the guest conductor, there's a Thomas Sherman [Thomas K. Sherman] I think he's still living.  When I played with what they call, it's called the New York Little Orchestra [Little Orchestra Society], that was in Newark, New Jersey, at a place called the Mosque [Mosque Theatre; Newark Symphony Hall, Newark, New Jersey].  And then New Haven Symphony [New Haven Symphony Orchestra] I cannot remember the conductor's name and that was up in, in what, Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].
Story_ID: 534168
Speaker 1: What would you say was the highlight of Marian's [Marian Anderson] career for you, given the time you have known her (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, dear. Well the Metropolitan [Metropolitan Opera House, New York, New York] and I got to see it here in '57 [1957] although she made her debut in '55 [1955], but I couldn't get to that.  But the stand, at the time I was standing in as they say the nosebleed gallery (laughter) I saw that in person.  And to go back stage there's a picture inside, she looked so young because she was to represent a woman in her twenties, and she was fifty-eight.  And they were just waiting to see if she could hit, although it was written for a mezzo, but it was a high note.  Her voice had such a range, and so you know how some people is waiting to see what's gonna happen.  But it was full, because she took very good care of herself physically she didn't smoke, she didn't drink, and she got all of her rest, she was never ever sick.  And just to hear when she hit that high note, we have recording of it from the book over when, when Marian sang, I don't know if Miss Phyllis [Phyllis Sims] told you about that book, where is it?  Ah, she's put it away. But we help to edit it and the son of what's his name, the movie director Selznick [David O. Selznick], Selznick who produced 'Gone With the Wind.'  His son [sic.] produced this book ['When Marian Sang: The True Recital of Marian Anderson,' Pam Munoz Ryan]; it's around here somewhere it had been up there.  And we had a big opening here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and several of our singers performed, one in particular did the aria she came in the costume the beads and all, yeah.  And so we had some wonderful experiences with different people we've met.

Speaker 1: How long did your concert career last before you started with the school?
Speaker 2: Well it was almost intermingled I think in the '60s [1960s] in the '60s [1960s] when I started teaching in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: So she retired in the '60s [1960s] also?
Speaker 2: Yes and, yeah actually '65 [1965]--'60s [1960s] she made a world tour you may have read about that, we had an itinerary upstairs of her where she sang.  And who presented her the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] or The Links [The Links, Incorporated] and so on, The Links have been very good to us, yes they've helped us.  And, and also the AKAs, Marian Anderson was an honorary AKA.
Speaker 1: Well, you're both following the traditions and the footsteps of those organizations.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes indeed and I was so pleased as I say this event in September, so many people have said, "Oh, they can't do it in three months, it's not pos- ." I said, "We don't say can't and we don't say don't." I looked at the committee; I said, "You have been chosen because of your abilities to gravitate toward the people and have them support this event."  It was our first real major fundraiser [for the Marian Anderson Historical Society, Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And when was that?
Speaker 2: September 7th [2006].
Speaker 1: Just this past September?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: So that was your first major fundraiser?
Speaker 2: Major, right.
Speaker 1: So this venture is still quite new?
Speaker 2: Yes, and people are still resounding to toward it, they just can't imag- but even some of the committee people.  One man said, "Well now, I'm in the economics department at University of Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and financially, it just isn't done."  I said, "We're gonna do it," I said, "because we're not--." I said, "If so, not you're gonna have to pay for this dinner," (laughter).  We had two hundred people, all paid for, I've had different groups I think Comcast [Comcast Corporation] bought like a table but for corporate be like five thousand dollars.  So if a person wanted to attend they didn't have the, tickets were $250, we could give them a little leeway.  Because the tables were paid for, and the lady who helped us with that was the one who does the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] luncheon, I don't know if you've heard of Teta Banks [Teta V. Banks] phenomenal lady, and so she handled the corporate people.  So that, the tables are paid for and the individuals buy seats.
Speaker 1: And then you can give them a break on the seats?
Speaker 2: Yes, you can.
Speaker 1: If need be because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --the tables themselves are paid for.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, it was the Frank- that's the one that was at the Franklin Institute [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 534170
Speaker 1: What made you decide to go into, the into the school system [School District of Philadelphia], as opposed to pursuing a career as a concert pianist?
Speaker 2: Because it wasn't practical, since I say, I like to eat well everyday (laughter) as my parents [Blanche Taylor Burton and Anthony Burton] would always remind me: "And suppose you don't get a concert for two months, what are you gonna do, you gonna work in a department store?  You don't like to stand." And so teaching was, it was prestigious and it was uplifting, and I, I loved children, being able to help the young people.  And I was always a pianist who taught.  One time we had a concert I was in a gown, the ushers were dressed up you know, the students were as ushers.  And we had a little lesson on how you act at a concert, you wait until the person is finished then you clap.  So it was a learning experience.
Speaker 1: For them having a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --this icon teach for them, teach them.
Speaker 2: 'Cause often I would come in when I was substituting, and I would play, say, "Our teacher doesn't play," and it's interesting there are many music teachers who do not play a piano.  They just have to learn enough to get through the exam, so I would sit down and play, sometimes I--in times of 'Superman' I'd play Super- "Oh you play that?"  Then I teach bells, I had the resonated bells, they loved them.  Teach them how to play 'Young and the Restless' ['The Young and the Restless'] which is just descending notes coming down, but I'd be playing the melody and they couldn't believe it.  One child's mother came, said, "I don't believe she did it, she came home and she said--." I said, "Well let's sit down." I said, "Get the bells, out my dear," (laughter), yeah.  'Cause they have to have instant success, this is why I try to give, you can't do so much of the cerebral and writing and so on.  They have to experience it, so things like well during the holidays they love 'Jingle Bells,' 'Joy to The World,' just come right down the scale, yeah and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So your first teaching job was at?
Speaker 2: Let's see it was at Kensington High [Kensington High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I recall (laughter); yeah, I was there, I was what you call long term. I think I was there maybe a month or two.  And my first appointed job was at a disciplinary school, O.V. Catto [O.V. Catto School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is a center now.
Speaker 1: And what did you do there, you taught children who--
Speaker 2: I taught music.
Speaker 1: You mean students who--
Speaker 2: It was all boys and they, there're infractions were, were minor compared to some of the things the young people, maybe that person pouted at a teacher or talked back to a teacher or principal you know.  I see some of them now; many of them are doing well, a few have been in jail, I saw one young man he said he had just served twelve years.  He was a lookout and it was a murder committed at a grocery store, that sort of thing, and then some of them get into drugs.  They are not able to cope; you see if they don't have families or someone to support them, they can't cope, where do they turn?  And someone gives them a happy pill or something or some weed that, and they think everything is all right.  I see somebody well, boy, I was getting some shrimp, this young man he said, "Miss Lyles [HistoryMaker Blanche Burton-Lyles], you still Miss Lyles?"  "Oh what has happened to you?" He said, "I just couldn't handle it you know," he has three children. I said, "How you gonna take care of the children?"  I said, "I'm not taking care of them," (laughter) "my taxes," and this is what often happens.  I think two or three children, they don't have a good job you know, how many burgers can you flip? You have to have something that you enjoy doing.  I mean I loved to play, I would always be in music one way or the other, you know as I said, I was an organist for a while.  And, and I play all different kinds of music, you know.
Story_ID: 534171
Speaker 1: So it sounds like, I mean a lot of people look upon you as a Marian Anderson historic, historian--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --but it sounds also like that you have used music as a ministry to help young children--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and to educate them.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, without a doubt.
Speaker 1: Which do you consider yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, I consider myself minister in music you know, enlightening and uplifting, sometimes I would go into a class and just start playing something it might have to do with the holiday or whatever.  You get their attention, you have to get their attention on their level, that's why I have things like what's the name of that, 'Exodus,' you remember that movie and this song?  And they would get to learn to play, because music is not that difficult, of course it can become very, very involved.  But some of the basic things are very simple, because they're only eight notes on the white keys you know.  All the together with the black keys are only twelve notes in a, an octave.  And then it repeats itself over and over again.  Thou, and I tell them there's no H, I, Js in music just A to G, and it repeats over again.  So then they say, "Oh." Then when they're able to hear it, it's just like--this little girl I'm getting, take keyboard to as a present.  She'll be amazed; she'll be playing 'Jingle Bells' and 'Twinkle, Twinkle' ['Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'] you know, right away.
Speaker 1: What do you think is the key to having children become interested in music early introduction?
Speaker 2: Early definitely because see that unleashes a portion of the brain that is for the arts and it's a shame that have discontinued it, music in so many schools, music and art.  But there's many a person who would be a very fine musicians; they may not be a mathematician, I certainly wasn't, I had to have tutor for geometry (laughter).  But that, they are able to appreciate and find they can express themselves in so many different ways, even now on the computers you, and that really test their creativity.  Any young person is able to create something musically and they hadn't heard this before, but they did it.  So the same when you're learning from the masters as we might say, the composers you learn it and you might do it your way.  I'm sure you've heard different musicians play different styles of different people you know, I'm gonna play this like Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart], play this like Chopin [Frederic Chopin] like Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven].
Story_ID: 534172
Speaker 1: Who is it that taught you your sense of elegance and style (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother [Blanche Taylor Burton], my mother, oh yes she would never go to the front door if she didn't have her lipstick on, her earrings and she wouldn't wear the same earrings in the evening she wore in the daytime (laughter).  And hats she loved hats, and gloves she always told me, "Now you keep that left glove on, kid gloves, you always got them a half size smaller," (laughter).  "And you keep the right one on so you can shake hands, but a lady never takes both gloves off," (laughter).
Speaker 1: So were there, were there charm schools at the time black charm schools?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes there were, Ruth Harper, who's deceased now, had a charm school [Ruth Harper Modeling and Charm School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], she was very successful here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And she became a state legislator, she had one, there were several.
Speaker 1: Did you attend one?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You didn't need to.
Speaker 2: I didn't have time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Didn't have time?
Speaker 2: No, didn't have time but no mother made sure everything was coordinated you know your gloves, your hat, hat and pocketbook usually matched.  Your gloves, usually white in the winter it might be black, and I love fashion.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what about Miss Anderson [Marian Anderson]?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness, she kept a diary of what she had worn at concerts in different cities, so when she went back the next year, she wasn't wearing the same gown.  'Cause I only, I've heard so often a person I knew I won't name the person.  Came back to Philadelphia for a concert, she wore that last year when we saw her, they don't forget, women don't forget things like that (laughter) yeah so.  This she did and I always tell the young people I say, "You must always be impeccably dressed." Said, "No runs, always carry an extra pair of stockings, you know.  And so that you're well groomed no matter where you have to go, you can't give the excuse, "Oh I didn't know--." No, no, you have an extra pair in your bag."
Story_ID: 534173
Speaker 1: So as she retired and, and you were in the school district [School District of Philadelphia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean you know teaching--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and she retired, did she spend a lot of time here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or most of her time in Connecticut?
Speaker 2: She spent more time in Connecticut, see her mother [Annie Rucker Anderson] passed in I think it was '61 [1961], and she came here intermittently until her sister died next door, which was in '91 [sic. 1990].  She didn't come back after '91 [1991] that was her last trip here, they named the sickle cell unit [Marian Anderson Comprehensive Sickle Cell Care and Research Center] at Chris- St. Christopher's Hospital [St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] because, she said one of her dreams was to become a doctor.  So they took that opportunity to name the sickle cell unit for her.
Speaker 1: Did she have any other people that she was mentoring the way she was mentoring you?
Speaker 2: Well no because see, I was a pianist which was so unique, that's why I always had to tell people, "No, I'm not a singer."  She mentored Natalie Hinderas [Natalie Henderson Hinderas] for a bit, I know this, but I think it was because of the connection my mother [Blanche Taylor Burton] had with her.
Speaker 1: And what, how would you describe the connection your mother had with her?
Speaker 2: Well my mother was the pianist for the church choir [at Union Baptist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], so that's how they're con- they're connected
Speaker 1: Were they friends?
Speaker 2: I would say they were friends, yes they weren't very, very close but there only, my mother's three years older than she was.  And so they just kept in touch and the nice part she would have her sister, who was a good friend of my mother, Mrs. DePreist [Ethel Anderson DePreist] to call and say, "Yes, Marian's [Marian Anderson] coming in town she wants to see you and Blanche [HistoryMaker Blanche Burton-Lyles].  Wants to know what's--." You know, so that was very, very special to have someone of that magnitude to ask you to come up so they could find how you're doing.  And you just read about her in the newspaper you know singing before thousands reviewing troops, like forty thousand troops during World War II [WWII], I think it was.
Story_ID: 534174
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about some of the people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --I asked you what were some of the misconceptions about--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --about Miss Anderson [Marian Anderson], and you said well one of the things that people maybe felt she didn't give as much as they knew her to--that you know that she gave back.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly always. And just the young artists scholarship she helped was a thousand dollars.  One year, and it was interracial, one year it was five hundred to two young people.  And one of the young ladies was at Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] too; she, she was the first, one of the first non-blacks to win.  So as with ours she just said, "Many African Americans need more help and they gravitate towards what we--."  There was a young Italian girl in Florida, we helped her.  And let's say, we make no restrictions except they be extraordinarily talented, and be willing to sit down and listen.  Because I think that my experience of thirty, forty years can be very helpful to a young singer, particular because it makes a difference. You're in the classical world, certain barriers--one singer said in her interview, "Oh, there were no barriers."  Now she has, she'd been to Europe once, which was quite different than being here.  And so I said, "Why did you put that in your write up?" I said, "Because no matter where you go they see you first.  And they form their opinions you may not be aware of it but you have to accept it and know who you are.  And that you are an artist who happens to be black, but you are black, you know."  So I said, "They're gonna try to make certain restrictions on you, you have to be aware of and how you handle it.  How do you--," like, when Marian Anderson was on the road, she did not know where she would stay, if she wasn't staying with friends.  They had to recommend a family the time when she was traveling there were no hotels open to her.
Story_ID: 534175
Speaker 1: Do you have some of those same experiences traveling around?
Speaker 2: Well I didn't when I went to the colleges. I stayed on the campus, I was the guest of Dr. and Mrs. Benjamin Mays [Mays' second wife, Sadie Mays] at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was in the '60s [1960s] as I recall.
Speaker 1: In the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the invited you to play at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Yes I was there for a concert; I played at Atlanta U [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], Morehouse, Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] which was right across, a school at the college campus.  What is it called, like a quadrangle over there, there are several colleges (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I didn't get to Clark--
Speaker 1: --Spelman.
Speaker 2: Yeah when I was in South Carolina I played at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina] and Benedict [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina].  And I joined the sorority up here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because not being surrounded by that many African Americans, I thought it would be good to have other like-minded women who are college level, and it's very beneficial.  And that award, that statue is the highest award of my sorority; they gave me two years ago, the Sadie Alexander award [Sadie T.M. Alexander May Week Award].  Who was, Sadie Alexander [Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander] was our first national president, yeah.
Speaker 1: And which sorority are you a member of?
Speaker 2: Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority].
Speaker 1: Delta, you're a Delta?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Nice.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you we were just talking about some of the places, some of the other places you performed.  So you, you did an extent of college tours?
Speaker 2: Yes, basically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to historically black colleges [HBCUs].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 534176
Speaker 1: And we plan on doing that again with one or two of our singers, you see, focusing on Marian Anderson.  How we are preserving her legacy through these young singers, we find them in colleges, that's where Leontyne Price, basically was discovered.  And many others, [HistoryMaker] Jessye Norman in colleges, and they're all following Marian Anderson's footsteps, whether it's Kathleen Battle.  There are a few others which names I can't recall at the moment, but they're all following in her footsteps.  Many times--Grace Bumbry.
Speaker 2: Audrey, what's Audrey's last name?
Speaker 1: Oh, Audra McDonald.
Speaker 2: Audra.
Speaker 1: Now she is versatile and that she's won acclaim as a Broadway star, but she graduated Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York], classical field.  So it's a wonderful firm background to have you know that classical beginning, you can't go wrong (laughter) you can usually if you're not singing a solo somewhere that you're in a play or musical like you can be on a concert stage.  And our scholars, I like to call them scholar artists.
Speaker 2: Scholar artists.
Speaker 1: Yeah because most of them have graduated or they're in graduate school, one young lady's at Manhattan School of Music [New York, New York].  She just got her master's [degree] from George Mason University [Fairfax, Virginia], she was one of our performers. We had eight to perform up here at our evening concert in September.  In the morning was the unveiling of the statue, and we had two singers, young man who said, "I will now sing 'God Bless America'"; oh, it was awesome.  That mezzo, who's an understudy incidentally for [HistoryMaker] Denyce Graves sang the 'Ave Maria' [Franz Schubert].  And as she finished they unveiled the statue, ah (laughter) we have all that on video, yeah videotaped.
Speaker 2: How, what role did you play in getting the statue, of being bronzed?
Speaker 1: It was because they were in touch with us through our Internet and they contacted Phyllis [Phyllis Sims] and they said, well the artist [Meredith Bergmann] is in New York [New York].  That's where she was working on, in the studio, and said, "We know your museum [Marian Anderson Historical Residence Museum, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], we would love to bring it through to you before we go to South Carolina."  So we're saying, "Why's it going there?" And they explained about this couple [Susan Phifer Johnson and George D. Johnson, Jr.] and their interest, and the young women at this, it's a women's college [Converse College, Spartanburg, South Carolina].  They informed--and feel pride in artist of, I think they have a lady astronaut's sculpture artist, as well as the writer Emily Dickinson, um-hm yeah.  And that's how that, and so we were just thrilled so we made a big, oh my goodness, and we had about twenty members of the choir, the orchestra to come up for the evening concert.  And we had a four course dinner and everyone's in black tie, it was mag- and it really brought an awareness to many people.  Those who attended and those who didn't to hear about our artists, they had never heard such voices, ah, they just applauded and applaud.  So this is the springboard from which we have the concert in February and then Easter Sunday, they don't know about that yet (laughter).  In fact they're just hearing about this, save the date for February 27th, you know.
Speaker 2: And on the 27th is the concert (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Birthday at the--
Speaker 2: Birthday.
Speaker 1: --at the church [Union Baptist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: At the church.
Speaker 1: But all day it'll be open house here, and they'll be refreshments here.
Speaker 2: And then in the evening the performances (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Six o'clock, yeah.
Speaker 2: --will start at the church.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 534177
Speaker 1: When did you become interested in preserving her legacy?
Speaker 2: Well shortly after I retired, I retired from teaching [from the School District of Philadelphia] in '92 [1992] technically, and I did some traveling.  And I was saying there's so many singers, I would hear them say, "Oh we can only do so much," and they didn't know which direction to go, many of them.  And so I knew how wonderful Miss Anderson [Marian Anderson] had been to me and I said, I must do something to continue this.  And to support and encourage these young people, so I got a few friends together.  And now we have a large, I would say a retinue of people who want to know, what are you doing, how can we help, and that's the best thing to hear (laughter).  And this event in September really reconfirmed my belief in doing this, and continuing it you know.  So we're having some people who are in touch with the schools to bring more school children here.  And they come over, they have their papers, they've been on the Internet (laughter) and they, "Oh yes we knew about the, this and we read it in here."  'Cause there are nine hundred boxes in the University of Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] Marian Anderson collection, nine hundred she gave it.  She gave them all her papers like sales slips, like for the kitchen she put six hundred dollars down in 1940.  That kitchen only cost fifteen hundred when I say that, stainless steel kitchen in 1940; but she saved receipts and different things.  I'm glad she did; and how this, the floors were put down in 1926, I think and so she had such insight and foresight (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So after you retired--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you were trying to think of something to do--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to preserve her legacy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did you come, how did you come back to the house and--?
Speaker 2: But see I only lived four blocks from here, and I go to church [Union Baptist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] almost regularly across the street, and I'd see different people sitting outside.  And I, and I said, "Do you whose house you're living--?" It was rental property for nine years before I got it.  And they said, "No, no one mentioned about Marian."  I said, "Well this was her home." They took such good care of it, we haven't had to patch anything.  This place was like this when we said, we had wall to wall carpet, and when I looked at it, I didn't mention to the realtor, I said, "Aren't there floors under here?"  When I look around this step you can imagine I said, "Oh, it's still in good condition," and of course you saw the basement.  And there was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And it, it was always your idea to restore it and have it become a historical--
Speaker 2: Yes, too that it become a museum like the Betsy Ross House [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and that's, and after we all take wings, we're forming an endowment. Those are the next plans for the next few months.  To raise funds that the principal will remain, the interest just for preservation you know like pointing the back of the house, which it needs bad.  I hope the snow won't come in (laughter) and just paint up, we had just had a new pavement put out last week, we paid to put it in.  It has those little pebbles which was from that period, early oh 1940s and so on; we wanna things within the integrity of the period.  That's why that awning is the way you see it.
Speaker 1: So what is it about her legacy that you want to live on?
Speaker 2: Well about the lady herself, what a great lady she was, and the young people need to know she was not one who said, "Well she just came out of rehab."  And you know you hear about so many of the young artists, we know they have many more temptations.  But she had them too, but she remained focused and that they learned that this great lady's art can be repeated and saved through these young performers.  'Cause there're some spectacular voices out there, but mainly just need structure and guidance that you shouldn't be coming in at three o'clock in the morning (laughter) unless it's New Year's Eve.
Story_ID: 534178
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So how are the students enrolled in your program, do they audition?
Speaker 2: They contact us.
Speaker 1: They contact you?
Speaker 2: With a C- a CD and their bio, some, a few, a few of them come up with--one young lady oh and she's from San Francisco [California].  She's been to Germany and last year Phyllis [Phyllis Sims] flew out to hear her with the San Francisco Symphony and she was so thrilled.  She introduced Phyllis, she said, "There's someone who has flown more than three thousand miles to hear me sing."  This girl's incredible, Hope Briggs from San Francisco, and she will be singing in Brooklyn [New York] I think early next year.  So we plan to get a group to go up and hear her.  One of our singers just made her debut at the Met [Metropolitan Opera House, New York, New York] in March, she's a Philadelphian.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Karen Slack, she just, she finished Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] before that, she went to the school performing arts [Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and she's incredible, I mean she just grows and blossoms.  She was the guest in New York [New York] we were up that last weekend, so opera group called Opera Noir, it means black.  And we went to their program and three of our singers performed, one was a mezzo soprano and Karen was the guest soloist.  Oh and she came out, she had one what I call the Kathleen Battle stole that came to the ground. (Background noise) Yes, she was quite, quite wonderful.
Speaker 1: So what is your relationship with Kat- to Kathleen Battle, do you know her?
Speaker 2: Well I have met yes, I have met her I think she knows about our scholars, and several of the singers like [HistoryMaker] Denyce Graves has been here.  She knows about our scholars who are helping and she gave us this computer I believe--.
Story_ID: 534179
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We were talking about Miss Anderson's [Marian Anderson] legacy and why it was important for you to preserve it and some of the things you were getting out it, and buying the house itself.  So what are some of things you've done with the house [Marian Anderson Historical Residence Museum, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Well the house (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) since you've had it?
Speaker 2: --is a tourist attraction and of course we have many of our archives that have been scanned and they're very important, and they're very valuable.  So we, we have so many we had to get assistance to have it, Miss Sims [Phyllis Sims] our curator handles all of that that.  She does all the photography and enlargement and so on, we have enlargements that we carry when, when we are on tour to different schools and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What is in the archive that you have?
Speaker 2: The archives we have pictures that many people do not have like there's one in particular a picture of this house.  Before the steps were turned, I think in 1937 and expresses her how she returned after to twelve years and the writers spoke to her and he said she was the same person except she was wearing French originals you know, and.
Speaker 1: Any, what else is in that collection, the archive that you have some photographs?
Speaker 2: Yes photographs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Any papers?
Speaker 2: There are a few, there are a few papers, yes we have some papers; again, as I say things we have the University of Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] does not have.  Because people bring us personal things that there only one of a kind.
Speaker 1: Of course any personal letters in, in the?
Speaker 2: Well there's one that is being delivered to us that was sent from a ship, when she was on the Ile de France [SS Ile de France].  And of course we have one of the original copies of her autobiography ['My Lord, What a Morning: An Autobiography,' Marian Anderson] that she autographed for me.
Speaker 1: When, when, what are some of the times that she actually saw you perform, did she come to see you perform?
Speaker 2: No she wasn't able to see me perform, except here at the house.
Speaker 1: At the house, so you performed (laughter) she had her own private concert, you were--was she pleased with the, you, the out, your outcome (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and the stuff you we were able to achieve?
Speaker 2: She was very, very pleased I know when I graduated, I sent her a beautiful letter of appreciation for making this all possible, when I graduated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you think she'd--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --when I graduated from Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And what do you think she would think now about what you've done with her home?
Speaker 2: Oh she would say, "Oh, why all the fuss, but I'm glad you did it," because we haven't had to change anything.  Those are the original lights on the wall, the original floors and the railing, so we're just continuing the appreciation, especially for young people.  We have master classes here, the late great Sylvia Olden Lee did a few master classes here, she was a great accompanist.  She coached [HistoryMaker] Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle among others and so this is our, well we hope to continue.  People like Angela Brown and others who come here and give up their knowledge to young singers.  'Cause this is what they need the experience of the past of those who are performing and doing what these young people hope to do on a long term basis.

Speaker 1: Who are some of the people now, you mentioned two women before you mentioned one that's performing in Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 2: Yes, she will yes that's Hope Briggs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hope Briggs, and--
Speaker 2: --from San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: You, you mentioned another.
Speaker 2: Karen Slack, Philadelphian and who--
Speaker 1: And who are some of the men?
Speaker 2: DeAndre Simmons, he's from San Diego [California] and he's performed nationally and he's been to Europe, he's now in graduate school, Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] opera department.  And of course Issachah Savage who finished Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], he was our first scholar.  And he's at Catholic University [The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.]; he's on tour in the United Kingdom [UK] now for six months.  An astounding man, tenor one of the finest.
Speaker 1: Do you have any students on Broadway?
Speaker 2: There is one who is doing some off-Broadway things which he's, he just moved, relocated to New York [New York] and he's tapped quite a few auditions.  And he's versatile and that he does, the spirituals, the arias but, he also does Broadway.  Rag- he was in 'Ragtime' [Terrence McNally] and a few other shows, and he loves that like Audra McDonald.
Story_ID: 534181
Speaker 1: So do you have a favorite genre of music that you like to perform or that you like to listen to, are they the same?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, Chopin [Frederic Chopin], no--Chopin, Rachmaninoff [Sergei Rachmaninoff], Debussy [Claude Debussy] and some Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] symphonies and the concertos.
Speaker 1: What's different about you now versus you as the child prodigy?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I'm more aware of what's going on in the music and the reaction of the audiences; you must please your audience.
Speaker 1: Is that something Marian [Marian Anderson] taught you, or?
Speaker 2: Yes and no, I think her concerts were always really even for raising the audience level so they would know more, that's why they're with the program the music is so important.
Speaker 1: And they are so important because they raise?
Speaker 2: The consciousness of the audience so they're able to know what they just heard, it's just like in opera you know they have the libretto so you know what you hear.  And then the above the stage you know they have the, they have very important piece that translates.
Story_ID: 534182
Speaker 1: So I also read that you're trying to turn this into Anderson village [Marian Anderson Heritage Village, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which means that they, you have her?
Speaker 2: Residence [Marian Anderson Historical Residence Museum, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) House residence?
Speaker 2: The birthplace on Webster Street, her elementary school [Edwin M. Stanton Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which a half a block away, 17th [Street] and Christian [Street].  And you have the recreation center half a block from there, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then the church?
Speaker 2: Of course right across the street, so, therefore, you have all the elements, just a matter, I don't know what we have to do get the city council [Philadelphia City Council], so--
Speaker 1: What are your, what are your immediate plans for this space and then the birthplace space?
Speaker 2: Well to be preserved, that's the most important thing as I said with the new pavement and continuing to help our scholars and the February 27th event.  Which will celebrate her 110 birthday, it'll be open house here all afternoon, and six o'clock in the evening our scholars will perform at her church across the street, Union Baptist Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Was there ever a time after she stopped performing that she was not as known as she is now?
Speaker 2: Never, no, just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was--
Speaker 2: --the name Marian [Marian Anderson]--
Speaker 1: --she was always.
Speaker 2: Always, always, as Isaac Stern said in the video, "If she hadn't been a singer, she would have been a prominent person just because of her speaking voice."  You know she was with United Nations [UN] for a while, then she would just make personal appearances, not receiving any awards, she didn't want any more of those.  But just, the young people got to see her to know that she was living and breathing.
Story_ID: 534183
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So are there currently, or, or I mean within your, within your group of performers were there other African American pianists that came along with you outside of the one that was here?
Speaker 2: Natalie [Natalie Henderson Hinderas] I mentioned.
Speaker 1: Natalie?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there just weren't that many, there was a young lady, she's deceased, she became a Broadway orchestra conductor, Harriet and it was, Harris [Harriet Harris] was her last name.  And she conducted, I mean pit things, such as 'Bubbling Brown Sugar' [Loften Mitchell] and things like, she only lived to be fifty-five, she was at Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] after me.
Speaker 1: So that's, that's a very small world, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, now there are some in New York [New York], I don't know all the names, there are some younger ones who are outstanding.  And they're hopefully pursuing a concert career, but they need to go to Europe, they need to go Europe.
Speaker 1: Still?
Speaker 2: Definitely.
Speaker 1: Even white performers?
Speaker 2: Yes, you notice they go, oh yes, they goes--well often they're able to afford to go they have a manager.  And several of our singers have been to Europe, there's another one Latonia Moore, who finished the Academy of Vocal Arts [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  She was making her debut at Weill Hall [Weill Recital Hall] at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] in May, she has an astounding voice, she's from Texas.  See DeAndre's [DeAndre Simmons] from Santa Monica [sic. San Diego, California], who else, there are several.
Speaker 1: Because you have about forty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At least or yes--
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: Different times.
Speaker 1: --rotating.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One young lady in New York, she does the performance of Marian Anderson, what's her name, Lauren, let's see Davis [Lauren Davis], she has several names.  Very, very talented, she's fr- she's a mezzo soprano.  And there's another young lady Lucia Bradford is in New York, Sequina DuBose is the one who is in Manhattan [New York].  There's one in Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, she's a coloratura, and she had a radio broadcast, classical music on campus, she's in graduate school now.  So you see they're doing the different things relating to their careers.
Speaker 1: But you were saying that they still have to go to Europe now and often the white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Basically to be accepted and then they come back here you know and they're just--
Story_ID: 534184
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who's Marian Anderson's manager or agent?
Speaker 2: At the time it was Sol Hurok, H-U-R-O-K, yeah and he managed Rubinstein [Arthur Rubinstein] and the Russian Ballet [Original Ballet Russe], he had the top performers of that period. But he met her in Europe (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you ever have a manager?  I'm sorry, he met her in Europe?
Speaker 2: Yes, he met her in Europe, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have a manager?
Speaker 2: Briefly, briefly I did.
Speaker 1: So who at the time were teaching African Americans about the business of classical music?
Speaker 2: Not too many.
Speaker 1: About how to make a business of it?
Speaker 2: Not too many, they're doing some of it now for the pop stars, because they make it, they spend it, and then five years they're broke.  And these mansions they have disappear because the upkeep is astronomical, you have to have a gardener, guard (laughter) yeah it's a lot.
Speaker 1: So who, you had a manager once (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: That was the concert that was at Friends Select School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] on the Parkway [Benjamin Franklin Parkway], um-hm, yeah it was, it was interesting.
Speaker 1: Did you ever want an agent or someone booking, was that ever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah we considered, now the time they were asking a fee from, I don't know if it's that way today, it probably isn't (laughter).
Speaker 1: Probably still is (laughter).
Speaker 2: I wouldn't be--yeah, they have to get their percentage.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Their percentages.
Story_ID: 534185
Speaker 1: So what is it that you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Well one who always upheld the classical music and the students, our motto is charting the course of education through music.  So you see they're interrelated, and that the young people are raised in an environment of the arts, and developing that part of their lives (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why is that so important?
Speaker 2: It is very, very important but that's another separate unit, that's the humaneness.  That's the, the special quality that makes us human and sensitive, creative all of that is a part of our lives.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: And if it's not satisfied, then people go into other negative directions.
Speaker 1: Why do you think there are less pianos in African Americans' homes today, you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They're costly number one they're very costly, unless they get an electronic keyboard they're very costly.  Starting at eight, ten, twelve thousand [dollars], you can get a car (laughter) yeah whereas in the earlier days everyone in the block, almost everyone.  There wasn't a block that didn't have a piano, it's, and as I say they get these keyboards.
Speaker 1: So you wanna be remembered for upholding the standard of classical music?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes and assisting and mentoring young classical singers so they know there is a place for them.
Story_ID: 534186
Speaker 1: Do you go to the event they have in Winston-Salem [North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: No, which one is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) annually they, the black composers--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --classical music (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, but I've been to a couple of the conventions of the Negro Musicians [National Association of Negro Musicians], in fact I went to the one in Las Vegas [Nevada].  Carried my CD player and spoke at the luncheon for them, they have some, now that's a very good venue for young people to perform for.  And they have districts all over the country, so that, I think that's very important.  They align themselves with organizations that are going to showcase their artistry this is what it is about, being seen and heard.
Speaker 1: So do you still perform when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: When?
Speaker 2: Yes whenever the opportunity presents, like the places like the Union League [Union League of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], The Ritz-Carlton [The Ritz-Carlton, Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the Bellevue [Bellevue-Stratford Hotel; The Bellevue Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for dinners, either the public dinners, I mean membership dinners.  All of these are special event and they need a pianist while they're dining, and I do dinner music (laughter) also.
Speaker 1: And is that rewarding for you?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness yes.
Speaker 1: You love the opportunity to have an audience?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So is it possible for you to play something for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 534187
Speaker 1: --Going to talk to us about sustaining or encouraging African (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sustaining, sustaining the classical music in the African American community, they must start very early, you don't wait until they're twelve or thirteen.  For instance, well Eric Owens is a very fine bass [bass-baritone] singer, he finished Curtis [Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], he's in Europe now.  He started earl- now with a singer, you have to start a little later, but with a pianist, they can start as young as four and five.  They have to be surrounded by hear it and like it, if they don't hear it, they don't know what it's about you know.  They don't realize most of the cartoons use classical music, most of the cartoons, I often would tell the youngsters that.  And so the earlier they start, and if the parent is aware, you know.
Speaker 1: So do you feel that I mean, I think I read that you said something about talent; it's sort of a God-given (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No question, yes but it has to be developed, yeah, it's like a diamond in the rough, yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you feel we each get something different or?
Speaker 2: Yes we all have our own talents, and musically you usually recognize in the child if they're around the music and they may have an instrument, there's an instrument around that they can play understand?
Speaker 1: Which ones do you suggest for young children to have around to play?
Speaker 2: The piano, because the piano is the jump off spot for anything else, and then they can get to any other ins, violin is very difficult for some youngsters.  So they wouldn't gravitate towards that as much as a piano.  Or the bells you know the xylophone.
Story_ID: 534188
Speaker 1: So as you look back over your--you've had several different careers.
Speaker 2: Basically (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about highlights from each one.  So the child prodigy, what would've been the highlight during those years?
Speaker 2: Performing in front of audiences in churches, mostly churches, because they've, that was the center of the African American life in their music.
Speaker 1: And, I, I saw in the Marian Anderson tape they talked about her touring churches and that at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: --one point throughout the year, she had more churches than any other place.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Was that your experience (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --as well?
Speaker 2: Basically when I went to North Carolina, I played at a church where my pastor, who was up here had been the, had been the pastor before he came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Reverend Kirkland [Joseph Timothy Kirkland] in Durham, North Carolina.  And then also, then I played at the colleges in, in the area.
Speaker 1: Were the, and, and during those years, what would you say was the highlight, what stands out most when you think about?
Speaker 2: Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The colleges?
Speaker 2: I would say Morehouse and Dr. and Mrs. Benjamin Mays [Mays' second wife, Sadie Mays] and the students, the students were so receptive.  They were great, always very, very special.
Speaker 1: And then your years after Morehouse you go into, and after, after your concert years you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Concert. Tour, teach, teaching.
Speaker 1: Teaching.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, again, the young people, they, they enjoyed, but it had to be relevant to them as I said, the things like 'The Young and The Restless,' oh they would catch that right away.  Then you might go into something else, but they, they have to have this instant satisfaction more or less.  If they go a week, because you know I only saw them once a week, maybe twice at the most.  And they didn't learn something they could do; they lost interest, so that's why with the bells, they could learn these different.  Popular songs that everyone knew and they can say, "Well, I can play that," so that made them a step up.
Story_ID: 534189
Speaker 1: I know she's pleased that one of her [Marian Anderson] mentors is keeping her legacy alive.
Speaker 2: I would, I would think so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: I feel her spirit, every time we come in this house [Marian Anderson Historical Residence Museum, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] without a doubt, I feel her spirit.
Speaker 1: And the stamp, when the stamp came out?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, we had hundreds of people all over the country send letters to organizations to Washington [D.C.] to ask them to pass, pass within or the person has to be deceased ten years.  And it's only thirteen years, she passed in '93 [1993] and the stamp came out in '04 [sic. 2005], you know so that's very good.  It's rare that it happens that soon after the person, after the ten years.
Speaker 1: Did you have any, any connection to it, were you working on it or?
Speaker 2: Very, much so yes, yes, we sort of started the, the flooding of letters you know we'd have people, we knew anyone out of town, we'd tell them, "Get ten of your friends and ten more to send letters."  And they had the initial unveiling in Washington, D.C., we went down there.
Speaker 1: (PHYLLIS SIMS): And we had sample letters (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, sample letters were sent out.
Speaker 1: So the initiative started with you?
Speaker 2: Basically.
Speaker 1: It was a grassroot effort.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you think it was possible (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (PHYLLIS SIMS): (Simultaneous) Yeah. That's why they gave us an award.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So who's idea was it to, was it something you had always thought about once you?
Speaker 1: Well I thought it was the next step after she had been dead ten years, we said, why not (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Put her on a stamp?
Speaker 1: Look forward to that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Yeah the stamp.
Speaker 2: Are there other things that you're in the future that you want to do along those same lines?
Speaker 1: Hm, let me see.
Speaker 2: You have a plaque out, out front?
Speaker 1: The plaque out front--
Speaker 2: (PHYLLIS SIMS): Easter Sunday.
Speaker 1: Right, this Easter, I was telling them. Again revisiting Marian Anderson at the Lincoln Memorial [Washington, D.C.], here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], at a venue.  And we will do the same concert with our scholars of the number she sang, she did at least six or seven, so that's--
Speaker 2: (PHYLLIS SIMS): And Easter falls on April 8th, and that's also the date of her demise.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's right she passed April 8th, 1993.
Story_ID: 534190
Speaker 1: So I read or I, maybe you told me, that she [Marian Anderson] was instrumental in King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] selecting the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.] for his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --speech.
Speaker 2: That's right. Because--that's right.
Speaker 1: Because she was performing, well you were old enough then to be aware of what's going on.
Speaker 2: And then Marian Anderson was there at the march in '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Were you there at the march?
Speaker 2: No, no I wasn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we have the album upstairs in a short album cover, bright red album cover that is from the March on Washington it said, "Marian Anderson, Odetta [HistoryMaker Odetta Gordon], Peter, Paul and Mary."  They were all there.  Whitney Young and the political people.
Speaker 1: Now when she came back from Europe did she become more politically active, did she ever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No. She was never politically active you know, they wanted her to be but no, she just said no she was a singer.  It was Paul Robeson who was more political, and so when she returned from Europe it was just gaining more access to concerts.
Speaker 1: What about you and the local community here, do you consider yourself to be politically active?
Speaker 2: No I wouldn't say that, I know I'm on both sides (laughter) so I keep it that way, Democrat, Republican I know them all, um-hm, so they think of me as a pianist not a political person.
Speaker 1: As a musician?
Speaker 2: Yes, and that's most important.
Story_ID: 534191
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well why do you, why, I'm going to ask you about history itself, why do you feel history is important?
Speaker 2: History is important because if you don't know where you came from you don't know where you're going.  And you have to know your roots of what happened and what caused you to be who you are.
Speaker 1: Why did you agree to be a HistoryMaker, to give us this interview?
Speaker 2: Well I was just so proud that you contacted us, I, because it's important that the world know, especially here in America that this great lady [Marian Anderson] lived.  What she stood for, and the people she influenced and that I was fortunate to be one of them.  And what she did for me, I'm willing to do for others, especially singers; we just concentrate on singers right now.  And there's so many of them, they're contacting us constantly from Florida, Detroit [Michigan], California.
Speaker 1: Well the numbers have grown?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: Have the opportunities grown?
Speaker 2: Basically yes, oh yes, the con- the competitions are open, they are, one of our young ladies just won a competition in Italy.  They gave her a crown, her name is Takesha Kizzard [ph.].  We sent her to Vienna [Austria] two years ago.  And we went to twelve or thirteen churches within three weeks and raised three thousand dollars to give her a roundtrip ticket, and two weeks of a hotel.
Speaker 1: So what did you take her with you and she sang at the churches and then everyone would empty out their pocket books (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, I took her, one Sunday we went to four churches we started (laughter) yes we, and she just sang this one number.  In fact at our concert, oh I must call her, our concert in February, she has another commitment but she'll probably be able, she wants me to play for her when she sings 'Great is Thy Faithfulness' because that was the winning number she sang at each church she went and they were so generous, I say two and three hundred dollars at each church.  'Cause they saw the potential they saw, heard they couldn't get over her, she's quite a showman, she's very expressive.
Speaker 1: So you know I can't remember the gentleman's name exactly but he said that a voice like Marian Anderson's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Toscanini [Arturo Toscanini].
Speaker 1: Toscanini.
Speaker 2: Toscanini, yes.
Speaker 1: Only comes along once in a century, or a hundred years.
Speaker 2: Two centuries really actually cause I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Have you heard anything that's close to it?
Speaker 2: No, no, there is one young woman she's Ewa Podles but she doesn't have the range you see Marian Anderson had the high range; the middle and of course that low.  That contralto was unlike any other.  Yeah it's quite rare as I say it was a special gift that she was tact with to be able to--and the world expresses that.  See it was just a miracle all over the world.  Her concerts would be sold out well in advance.
Speaker 1: Well we thank you for being a HistoryMaker.
Speaker 2: Well this is wonderful, it all went well (laughter). I remember most of--I wrote down some things that I had made some notes.
Speaker 1: Do you, did we cover those things.
Speaker 2: I, yes, yes you did, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Are you sure?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter) positive. After all this time.
Speaker 1: I know (laughter).  Well we thank you for the time.
Speaker 2: Yes, thank you.
