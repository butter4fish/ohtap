 Finchum  F. Reece  Today is April 26, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library and I   m in Tulsa, Oklahoma with  Forest Reece. We   re here to talk about Henry Bellmon, former governor  and US Senator. This is part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history  project. Thank you for having me today. Let   s start by having you tell us  a little bit about yourself, your childhood and education, and we   ll move  forward.  I was born in Monahans, Texas, in West Texas. I grew up in that area.  My father was an oil company employee at the same company for forty  years. During the eighteen years I lived at home, we moved eighteen  times, basically within the same area and back to the same town  sometimes. Graduated from high school in Iraan, Texas. There were  sixteen in my graduating class. Went to the University of Texas in 1959  off and on for about six years. Worked a lot. I was a state capitol  correspondent for newspapers and radio stations, while I was going to  school. Did a lot more work than I did going to school. After the end of  the legislative session in 1965 in June, the bureau chief for the Dallas  Morning News gave me a plane ticket to go to Dallas for an interview. I  told him I still needed nine hours to graduate from the University of  Texas and he said go anyway. They offered me  125 a week so I  decided I would go to work rather than finish my degree at that point.  Worked two years for the Dallas Morning News as a political reporter.  Subsequently, some of my friends asked me to go to the panhandle of  Texas and work for a candidate who was running for Congress in 1966,  was elected, Congressman Bob Price of Pampa, Texas. First Republican  from the area. At the time, there were, I believe, twenty-three  congressmen in Texas. Congressman Price and Congressman George  H.W. Bush of Houston were the only two Republicans in the delegation.  Went to Washington with the congressman in January of 1967 as press  secretary. Subsequently, in 1968, went back to Texas to work in another  5  Finchum  F. Reece  congressional campaign. Was unsuccessful, but President Nixon was  elected. Several of my friends suggested that I come back to Washington  and get a job in the Nixon administration. In February of 1969 I began  work as a political appointee in the US Department of Agriculture in the  Farmers Home Administration. The administrator that I worked for was  a former Oklahoma congressman, Jim Smith from Chickasha. So  through him, I was introduced to a bunch of Okies, including the  Bellmon staff. I was invited to go on the Fourth of July trip to the beach  with the Bellmon staff and the senator   s assistant, Elizabeth Morgan,  was one of those that went on the trip. We met on July Fourth and were  married on October 3, 1969.  The same year?  Three months later. When we were married, after the honeymoon, went  back to work for Congressman Price as his administrative assistant.  Worked there until the end of 1971. Sometime in late 1971, Senator  Bellmon   s administrative assistant, Drew Mason, advised me that the US  Senate Agriculture Committee was going to actually hire Republican  staff. The staff had always been non-partisan on the agriculture  committee. However, when Senator Humphrey returned to the Senate  from his stint as vice president in 1971, he wanted to do a large study on  rural development and hired about six staff members. So the  Republicans decided they would hire a staff member and I was the sole   Republican  staff member. Senator Carl Curtis of Nebraska was the  ranking Republican on the Rural Development Sub-committee so I was  recommended to him by Senator Bellmon. After what seemed like an  eternity trying to meet Senator Miller of Ohio, the ranking member on  the full committee, finally met him.  Said I was okay with him and so in early 1972, I went to work for the  Senate Agriculture Committee for the Republican members. We spent  almost all of 1972 doing studies, holding hearings, drafting legislation,  what would ultimately become the Rural Development Act of 1972,  which was basically a business development  act , ways to provide  business and government services to rural areas. Actually, since I was  working for the ranking member, Senator Curtis of Nebraska, I kind of  had to follow his lead. He and Senator Bellmon had some disagreements  on what would be in the legislation. The big part of the legislation was  creating a new rural development lending agency similar to the small  business administration. The Farmers Home Administration was already  lending in rural areas, although not to businesses.  Senator Curtis thought that they should take on this new lending  program for businesses. Senator Bellmon thought there should be a new  agency to handle that. Ultimately, that was voted on on the floor of the  6  Finchum  F. Reece  Senate and Senator Curtis prevailed, and Senator Bellmon and I agreed  that I had to support what Senator Curtis wanted to support. (Laughs)  That was how we agreed to disagree on that subject. So in the end of  1972, the act was passed that provided, among other things, that federal  agencies should be in rural areas where possible, which played a part in  when we decided to move our family back to the southwest. I was  offered a position with a federal/state economic development agency   Ozarks Regional Commission . The office was in Muskogee. I  suggested we move it to Claremore. My boss said,    Why not move it to  Tulsa?    I said,    Because I just helped pass a law that federal agencies  should be in rural areas where possible,    so we moved the office to  Claremore.  About eight or nine months later, President Carter was elected. So those  of us who were President Ford appointees turned in our resignation.  Carter administration asked me to stay on to close down the agency.  They decided they didn   t want to have the five regional economic  development agencies. So I spent about six months closing it down and  then Congress decided that they wanted it open. So I reopened in about  six months and then spent another six months closing it down after they  decided. Your government in action. (Laughter)  Worked with Senator Bellmon closely on the Farm Bill in 1973. That  was his idea to go from the old system of payments to farmers based on  how much they planted. He changed it, along with Senator Young of  North Dakota. They recommended going to a system where there would  be a target price for wheat, cotton, corn and if the market provided that  target price, then the farmers would get no payments. If the market  didn   t, the farmers would get a payment from the government on the  difference between what the target price was and what they actually  received in the marketplace. Also worked with Senator Bellmon on the  livestock auction legislation. There was quite a bit of fraud in the way  that some livestock auctions were handled, and we worked on that  legislation. And then in 1976, had the opportunity to come back to  Oklahoma, so after that, I was with the Ozarks Regional Commission,  Economic Development Commission, as assistant federal co-chairman.  Had the opportunity to interface with him on what the commission was  doing in Oklahoma, which is one of five states in the region. That was  our last official contact until he ran for his second term as governor.  Did you help much with that campaign?  My wife, Liz, worked full-time at it and I worked as I was able to. At the  time, I was very much engaged in the Education Task Force here in  Tulsa. The superintendent of Tulsa Public Schools had set up a  committee around each high school in the city to try to determine how to  7  Finchum  F. Reece  better the schools. We were in a situation where the enrollment had gone  down from a high of 80,000 in the 1960s to 45,000 in the 1980s. D  j    vu, as we speak    Here in April of 2011, the Tulsa Public Schools is  going through the same things again. Through our committees, various  committees, areas surrounding each high school, we recommended the  closure of several buildings. Now Tulsa Public Schools is going through  another closure of buildings because of the enrollment. Actually, the  enrollment now is about the same as it was in 1980.  Doesn   t make you a popular person, does it?  (Laughter) Wasn   t a very popular person at that time. As a matter of  fact, we did recommend the closing of two schools that our own children  attended. So in his first three years of school, my son went to three  different schools even though we lived in the same house. When  Governor Bellmon was elected to his second term, education was one of  his interests and he asked that I serve on the State Board of Education. I  was appointed to that in March of 1987, right after he took office. I was  approved by the Senate and started service in, I think, June of 1987.  Subsequently, worked with the governor and Secretary of Education  Holt on trying to improve education, what we could do to improve  education. Governor and Secretary Holt came up with some proposed  legislation but couldn   t get any member of the legislature to introduce  that legislation. Finally, Representative Veach of Tulsa decided to agree  to introduce the legislation.  It was called for a committee hearing and I received a call from the  governor to please go to Representative Veach   s home here in Tulsa and  explain to him what the bill said. Trying to explain a multi-multi page  bill in a short period of time was quite a challenge. He finally just asked  me to write up everything he needed to know, and he read that  information in the committee meeting. The bill never got out of  committee. He was the only vote for it. Subsequently, the governor  decided to appoint a task force that he and the president of the Senate  and the Speaker of the House, I think there were twenty-one members,  or twenty-two members, each one would appoint seven members and  together, the three of them, the governor, the speaker and the president  of the Senate, would appoint a chairman.  They agreed on George Singer of Tulsa as the chairman of that Task  Force 2000. I was kind of serving triple duty at the time. I was serving as  the governor appointee to the task force, I was still on the  superintendent   s committee for Tulsa Public Schools, and was also on  the State Board of Education. I worked closely with the superintendent,  Sandy Garrett, determining or giving information to the task force and  trying to get what we thought were the best recommendations before the  8  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  task force, to be passed by it. We subsequently issued that report and  most of it was converted to legislation and passed in 1990, I guess it  was. It was House Bill 1017. Then I served on the State Board of  Education for my six year term, until 1993, and that was after Governor  Bellmon had already left office. Since then, I haven   t done much.  I doubt that    (Laughter) Well, in your interactions with Henry, how  would you refer to him?  Governor Bellmon, or Senator sometimes, depending on the context.  (Laughs)  Not Henry?  No, no, no. We only said Henry amongst each other. I don   t remember  anyone ever calling him Henry to his face.  I wondered how to do it for interviews, I always say Henry Bellmon,  former governor and US senator.  Yeah. Some of the staff still call him Senator and some call him  Governor, so.  Well, something impressed you from the beginning when you met him to  keep you doing things with him through the years. Can you put your  finger on it?  Integrity. I think that   s the single word that when he decided what he  thought was right, that was the way it was going to be. Not to mean that  he never compromised, but he never compromised his principles. He  was not a hail-fellow-well-met type of person. He was, at least in my  contacts with him, always very businesslike and statesmanlike. It was  interesting that of all the politicians I   ve ever been around, most of them  were either full of themselves or wanted to just be one of the guys, talk  and pal around, but he was basically all business even in a more casual  setting. He just wasn   t a big talker.  What was it like being on a committee with him?  Never actually on a committee. We were just on the task force. On the  Ag Committee, he didn   t talk a lot unless it was a subject that he had a  very strong opinion about. Being a farmer, of course, anything to do  with farming. He was very opinionated. He was never so opinionated  that he couldn   t listen to someone else. It was not the kind of opinion  that it   s my way or the highway. He was more of a trying to work with  people and explain why he thought the way he thought. He was, most  9  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  times, very successful. One thing about the agriculture committee was it  was generally a very bipartisan committee, because most of the senators  on the committee were from rural states and all had a common goal. The  committee also handled food stamps, however, and the food distribution  program for the poor. There were some partisan divides with regard to  those programs, how they would be operated.  How do you think people perceived him around the table?  As not being political. Even though he had a political side to him, he  was, most of the time, aware of what the political thing to do was, that  really didn   t determine how he would ultimately come down on an issue.  He would determine what he thought the right thing was and stick to  that, no matter what the political consequences might be. He and Senator  Humphrey, actually, in the case of the Rural Development Act, they  worked together in opposition to some of the Republicans on the  committee. In other instances, he was just always evolving in terms of  alliances with whoever saw his viewpoint. He would work with them to  try to work situations out where everyone could agree the best they  could. If it came to an up and down vote, that   s the way it was, but he  tried to work things out before there was any acrimony.  Any favorite memories of times with him? Doesn   t necessarily have to be  work, it could be fun.  I think just being around and listening to him talk about issues. Even in  social settings, staff parties, that type of thing. Eventually someone  would ask him why he voted this way or why he thought a particular  way about some issue, and just to hear him sit and explain his thought  process, on the farm bill for example, the target price concept, getting  away from the old parity payment system. It was interesting to hear him  say    We were just sitting there in committee and Senator Young said  something and it just kind of,    That   s a good idea. Why don   t we expand  on it like that?    By that time, Senator Young was nearing ninety and not  a lot of times did he speak in committee, but he just said the words,    We  need a target price,    or something like that. Senator Bellmon took the  idea and ran with it, basically. So that was interesting how sometimes  just a certain comment would trigger his brain to decide how he thought  something should go.  Open minded.  Yeah, very open minded. But he had a set of principles that he operated  from and I think that probably, toward the end of his term as governor,  he was being looked upon by some Republicans as a liberal. In today   s  Oklahoma, he would really be a liberal. He was for free market  10  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  principles, very much, but then realized that there   s some situations  where people need a hand, and he was very much a people person even  though he was not, like I say, hail-fellow-well-met. He really enjoyed  talking to people and hearing their ideas and trying to do the best he  could for them.  Were you surprised when he didn   t go for a second term as governor?  Not really. I think the education thing really wore him down. That was a  long-term process, plus everything else. He   d kind of come back and run  under duress, I think. I guess most people that have been around him  would tell you that he enjoyed being governor a lot more than he did  being senator. He said being senator was kind of like snot, you just kind  of wipe it off and that   s all you could do. (Laughter) You really had no  power or authority. You   re just one of a 100 or one of 535 in Congress.  Then the president could go some other way, but as governor, you could  have a real impact on people   s lives. That   s why he decided to come  back and run for that second term, I think.  He crossed party lines many times on many, many issues.  Yes. Particularly on the education issues for House Bill 1017. Very few  Republicans voted for that. That was Republican Henry Bellmon and the  Democratic legislature that basically passed that.  Was that hammered out in one session?  Yes. There was a special session, actually. He called a special session.  Probably didn   t make him too popular, either, doing that.  No. I think, ultimately, everybody agreed it was probably a good thing.  There was still quite a bit of animosity between the teachers    union and  the Republicans, because the teachers    union never supported a  Republican for office. Because there was a big pay raise in there for  them, in House Bill 1017, for teachers some people saw it as giving in to  the teachers    union. I think Governor Bellmon saw it as a way to try to  better their profession and get more people into the profession that really  could do something for the children.  An investment for the future.  Right. Right. And one part of the legislation that was not adopted,  although we did adopt provisions for testing, which a lot of teachers  don   t like, I think many of us thought that you needed some way to  judge how students were doing and how teachers were doing. I guess  11  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  that will always be a tough thing to get everybody to agree on.  Personally, I felt as the governor did at that point, that you had to have  some measurement. Until someone comes up with a better one, that   s  about all you have at this point to determine if you   re getting your bang  for your buck, the taxpayer   s buck.  Did that also include the PASS  Priority Academic Student Skills   standards? What they have now where they have to meet certain  requirements for curriculum?  Right. Actually, House Bill 1017 created a curriculum committee, and I  think it was an administration committee, and I was also appointed to the  curriculum committee. We helped write the curriculum. Basically, we  were explained various options by professionals, and we helped select  the options we thought would be the best, those would be the ones that  actually students would be tested on. A lot of people talked about it  being a state mandated curriculum, which to the extent that there were  certain outcomes that we felt students should reach at certain grade  levels. That   s what they would be tested on to determine how well they  were working, achieving compared to other states, other countries and so  forth.  Is most of it still in effect today?  The basis of it, I believe. I   m sure there   s been some fine tuning in the  last twenty years, now. The concept of there being outcomes is  still   that   s every spring. That   s what students get tested on, those  outcomes, to see how well they   ve absorbed them or been taught them.  However you want to look at it.  Were you in the capitol the day it finally passed?  No, actually, I wasn   t.  You missed out.  Yeah, it was kind of a surprise deal. I was here when the governor came  to Tulsa to sign the bill and my wife and Linda Sponsler, who were on  his staff here in the Tulsa office, set up all that activity. I kind of stood  back in the crowd and watched it.  Was it a friendly crowd?  Yes, very. Basically a lot of students because the signing was actually  held on the playground of a school here in town.  12  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Picked your location with some thought.  Yeah. Yeah.  Is there anything about Bellmon that you think most people don   t know?  What you saw was what you got. Most people, after a point, came to  realize that. I had the benefit of living with someone who was there from  the beginning. So at times, you don   t know whose story you   re  remembering, hers or mine. (Laughs) It   s interesting to think back and  then when he was still living, we   d have a staff party at the farm,  generally, at least once or twice a year. Get to see the people you   d work  with and people who   d been there at a different time than you. That was  really fun, and I don   t know if anybody will try to restart those or not. It  won   t quite be the same without him around. It is very interesting. I got  to be kind of associated with the Senate staff, or the two different staffs.  There was the staff that went up there with him and then after the    74  election, there were a bunch of new folks that came up. Primarily OSU  graduates, I think all of them. I think I remember one OU graduate out  of the five or six new staff members that came on board in    75, I guess it  was, when he started his second term in the Senate. That was kind of  interesting working with them. One of the new staff members was a  recent OSU agriculture economics graduate at that time, named Doug  Jackson, who is now an attorney in Enid. He was the senator   s  legislative liaison for agriculture. I kind of tried to teach him the ropes.  He would call or he would come by and ask questions and every now  and then the senator would call and say,    Doug says this is this, is that  right?       Probably so.    Then, Senator Bartlett from Oklahoma was also  elected during that time that I was on the committee, and he also had an  agriculture liaison, agriculture expert on his staff, but time to time,     Forest, what   s Henry doing on this?    Had some calls from him.  (Laughs) It was an interesting time.  It seems like his main focus was either education or ag related.  Yeah, of course, then he became ranking member on the Senate Budget  Committee while he was a senator. Went through all of the things back  then that they   re going through now in Washington in trying to reduce  the budget and the deficit and all that. He was right there in the lead on  that.  Would that have been a bipartisan committee?  No, no. That was quite a partisan committee, because each party had  their idea of what should be cut and what should be expanded just like  13  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  L. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  they do today. I don   t think it was as partisan as it is today. I think a lot  of partisanship today is created not by the senators and representatives,  but by the pressure they   re getting from home. They   ve got to show that  they   re up there doing something. Not particularly the right thing, just  whatever they think the most number of their constituents wants to do.  Want to sell best at home?  Yeah, and that certainly wasn   t a Henry Bellmon mantra. His was what   s  best for the people. He didn   t go out and take a poll and see what the  most number of people wanted. He knew what he thought was best, and  that   s what he thought people had elected him for.  Probably not just what was best for Oklahoma, but what was best for the  country.  For the country, yeah. Although, Oklahoma was always first in mind. He  was very much an Okie. He was very much an Okie.  Did he feel like he had to convert you to one?  No, I think he felt like Texas and Oklahoma were pretty close. Having  not worked directly on the staff, that   s why I was always called the staff  son-in-law. I worked close, but never directly on the staff. Every time he  looked up, there I was with my wife, and she certainly wasn   t a  staff   daughter-in-law, she was the real thing.  Did he come to the wedding?  Yes, he did. He had his daughter, Gail. And actually, they walked down  the aisle right ahead of us, or right ahead of her. He just barely made it.  (Laughter) Wasn   t planned, just happened.  He went back and told the staff,    Liz had a really strange wedding. We  just walked in and were seated and then she came in     Of course, the  bridesmaids and everybody had already come in, you know. Just a little  late. (Laughter)  Most people there probably knew who he was.  Yeah. Yeah. In the 1974 Senate campaign, we came out and took  vacation time to come out and work in the campaign. She worked  around the headquarters in Oklahoma City and kind of took care of the  kid that we had at the time. I got to travel with him some and that was  interesting going around and hearing, as you do with campaigners, the  14  L. Reece  F. Reece  Finchum  L. Reece  Finchum  L. Reece  F. Reece  L. Reece  F. Reece  Finchum  L. Reece  F. Reece  same speech over and over and over and over. Kind of changed a little  bit for the audience, but he certainly didn   t have a rote speech, as such.  He changed it from time to time, but it was interesting. And then the  night of the election, it was a very close race that ultimately wasn   t  decided for several months. There was concern about the balance, and  we had some discussions about some of us going down to the Oklahoma  County Election Board and guarding the ballots. Make sure they weren   t  stuffed. (Laughs) I think he decided that that wasn   t necessary. We never  did that, but that was several sleepless months waiting for it going  through the courts and through the Senate. Finally the day the Senate  decided he was the winner, that was a big relief. I guess Liz might have  told you about that day that the Senate made that decision. He was on a  flight back to Oklahoma and his opponent wound up in the seat next to  him on the airplane. Was it Edmondson?  Ed Edmondson.  Yeah, Ed Edmondson. They were seated next to each other on the  airplane with no other seats left for one of them to move. (Laughs) He  said that was very quiet. Quiet trip back to Oklahoma.  Would have loved to have been a fly on the wall there.  Evidently the only comment was,    What do you think the chances of this  are?     (Laughter) Neither one of them knew, at that time, what the decision  was?  They just ended up sitting there, I mean going back on the same flight.  Yeah, they knew. That was after the     Ed Edmondson just knew that he had not prevailed in his challenge.  Kind of a tense time, I guess.  Had several parties there after, the staff parties. Senator was,    You  know, Ed and I were on the plane together. I just had to say,       What do  you think the chances are of this happening?       (Laughs)  Whoever booked his flight would have been the one that should have  said that.  Never flew first class. He probably was on Southwest.  It was assigned seats and that   s the way it came out. That   s kind of the  15  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  L. Reece  way it was. Kind of a dry sense of humor. He wasn   t, like I say, a big     He   d get to telling jokes every now and then, but they weren   t made up  jokes. They were things that actually happened. That was what he  thought was funny.  Traveling around the state a little bit with him, any funny stories from  road trips?  Gosh, that   s been so long ago.  Didn   t run out of gas. He had a driver, I   m assuming?  He  slept in the car frequently . I remember Joe Allbaugh was the driver,  who ultimately wound up as director of FEMA in Washington for  President Bush. He was Governor Bush   s chief of staff. I don   t know if  he was ever Henry   s chief of staff or not while he was governor, but  anyway, Joe, back at that time was a young fellow. Now he   s an  international businessman. He was driving us. We went to Okmulgee.  Actually, the host of the home and meeting in Okmulgee was an  African-American dentist there. All the people there were African-  Americans. He was really reaching out to try to tell everybody that he  was for all Oklahomans, no matter what their race, color, or creed, so  that was interesting. That was my first event that I attended with him.  Then we came here to Tulsa and this was more of a fundraising town.  When you came to Tulsa, you really were looking to raise money more  than convert people, because most of the people here were already  converted. Most of them were Republicans. This is where you expected  to get your big Republican vote if you were Republican in those days. I  guess still do. Wherever he was, I think people respected him. I don   t  ever recall anybody    even after the Panama Canal and the bussing  situation. Over here in Tulsa, there was not the animosity that there was  in Oklahoma City. I think, of course, they had the bussing in Oklahoma  City and they didn   t in Tulsa. That really never was a factor over here  like it was in Oklahoma City. It was an interesting time.  Do you remember instant seniority? Just talking about the way he put  things together that were just kind of memorable. When he went in for  the Senate against Mike Monroney, who had been senator for years and  years and Oklahoma, Oklahoma had a certain position in the Congress,  because of the seniority of their senator and everything. He went around  and started telling people that he had instant seniority, because he had  been Richard Nixon   s campaign manager, and he was president now so  he had instant seniority. (Laughter) It just kind of took the wind out of  some of that sail. Of course, the whole issue was that he didn   t have any  seniority, but he was going to get some.  16  F. Reece  L. Reece  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  L. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  L. Reece  F. Reece  L. Reece  Yep.  I just thought of that when you were talking about that.  I think by the time I went on the agriculture committee, which was three  years after he came to the Senate, that even though he was basically still  a rookie, he wasn   t looked upon that way. Just because of his demeanor  and his thoughtfulness and the way he operated. He had a lot more  seniority in actuality than he did in fact, because some people just  listened to him because of the way he went about business.  He impacted a lot of lives.  Yeah.  And brought you to Oklahoma.  (Laughter) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  That   s true. He turned you into an Okie.  Your interest in education has impacted more.  Yeah. Yeah.  His legacy lives on.  Yeah, that was an interesting time. I could have just been building a  career and doing more things that direction. Sometimes, you kind of  have to make a choice, and our choice was to work for the kids.  I don   t know if you told her, but I remember Henry had been elected to  the Oklahoma House when he was younger and just served one term,  because he thought he did a good enough job and people would re-elect  him, and of course, he didn   t campaign so they didn   t re-elect him. He  said he would never make that mistake again. But he said the hardest  position he ever held, even including the governorship, was being on the  Board of Education in     Billings.  Billings, and of course, nothing is as close to the ground, to the people as  Board of Education, what   s happening with their kids and their kids     education. We got a lot of that, and you got a lot of that with just all the  decisions you have to make.  17  F. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  L. Reece  F. Reece  L. Reece  Finchum  L. Reece  Finchum  L. Reece  F. Reece  L. Reece  Finchum  Which is true. Yeah. One of our big things in Tulsa, on our  superintendent   s committee, was to get parents involved, and that was  interesting. Liz went to volunteer at our local school and the principal  said he would find her a school to volunteer at. Like,    We don   t need  you.    (Laughter) When I got on the State Board of Education, I offered  an amendment to the rules that school districts would make certain  efforts to get parents involved. The next board meeting, there were  probably 150 superintendents there, opposed to the idea of parents being  involved in schools. One of their friends in the legislature came over and  told me that I was appointed, not anointed. So that kind of intimidated  the board. Out of six votes, there were only two of us that voted for  getting the parents involved. That really showed me the power of the  education bureaucracy in the state. The superintendents just didn   t want  parents involved and they really showed up.  Wonder how Henry would handle that. What do you think he would do?  Well, when you   re outnumbered, you   ve just got to kind of live to fight  another day. (Laughter)  But he also said,    Go ahead and do what you need to do.    He didn   t say,     Hold back on it.    He wouldn   t hold back on anything.  Yeah.  Have you talked to Don Ferrell yet?  Yes.  Because he has the funniest story. Did he tell you about going to the  funeral with Henry?  Yes.  (Laughter) I just wanted to make sure of that. That   s the kind of thing,  he   s just the common man, you know. Get on that tractor and drive it  down the road back to the farm, because he needed to get there.  Didn   t want to pay somebody to drive it. (Laughs)  Didn   t want to pay somebody to drive that all the way. He could do it.  Anyway, it   s those common touches.  Economy to the end, economist.  18  L. Reece  Finchum  F. Reece  Finchum  Yes, exactly.  Anything else before we sign off?  I think that   s it.  Well, thank you very much.  -------  -------
