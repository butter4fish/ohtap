Speaker 1: That's a picture of me in my boy scout uniform.  I was a member of Troop 42 at the Bethlehem Community Center in my hometown of Augusta, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Charlie Diggs--Congressman Diggs, visiting us in Nigeria, I guess Nigeria, and as Congressman sometimes did when you out on the field, that's all I can say about that.  That's Mal Whitfield right there.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's good.  Just describe him.  Just say that, that's fine.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's a photograph of Congressman Diggs paying a congressional visit to us in Nigeria and the person over to the left, the one in the dark suit, is Mal Whitfield.  Mal Whitfield belonged, as I did, to the United States Information Agency.  He was a sports officer in Africa and there he is in that photograph with Congressman Diggs.
Speaker 1: Well, very recently--you ready?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Very recently my grandson from Orlando, Florida came up and with members of his class, they wanted to visit--they visited D.C. and wanted to come to Howard [University] and so I gave them a tour of Howard and especially, including, the Ralph J. Bunche Center which I direct and there's my grandson, Greeley, Horace Greeley Dawson IV in my office talking to his grandmother on the phone.
Speaker 2: That's my high school graduation picture.  I was--graduated from Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in Augusta, Georgia in 1943 and that's the graduation picture out in front of the house, as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Here you have me in my role as director of the United States Information Office in Liberia presenting a film to President William V. S. Tubman, the president of Liberia and this film happened to be one dealing with the landing on the moon of the astronaut--first astronaut.
Speaker 1: One step for man.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Right.
Speaker 1: Just make sure-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  We're ready.
Speaker 1: On this occasion, I took Andrew Young and Coretta Scott King and her offspring, all of them except the oldest daughter, I took them on a--to Africa.  We stopped, first of all, in Rome and then we went on to Zambia and to South Africa and to Nairobi and across to Nigeria.  They were naming the library there in Lusaka for Martin Luther King, Jr. and they had Coretta come out to do the honors of opening it.  And to the left there is President Kenneth Calendar talking to Mrs. King.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a very interesting photo.  It has three American Ambassadors there and it--and my wife who's on the right.  In the center is Ambassador Mabel Smythe who was ambassador at one point to Cameroon.  Ambassador Don McHenry is next to my wife.  He was the ambassador to--he was the permanent representative which is an ambassador to the United Nations for the United States.  He followed Ambassador Young and, of course, I'm at the left.  He visited us in Botswana which is where this picture was taken.
Speaker 1: From my very early youth, I'm there on the left with my boy scout uniform on and all of those other people in there--well, this was a group of us probably about age 14, 15, or so, and we were grouped, preparing to go to summer camp.  On the other end from me is a colleague of mine, he's a very close friend--all of these are friends but this boy is a very close friend, lived on the same street with me, his name is Simon King--Kane (ph.), Simon Kane and he is a lawyer here in the District of Columbia.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Which one is he?
Speaker 1: This one.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Right here?
Speaker 1: Yes, Simon Kane.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right, ready.
Speaker 1: That's me at--when I was a senior in high school.  I had won the National Essay Contest put on by the NAACP.  The subject was "What Democracy Means To Me" and it was a very important issue at the time, of course, because of the War and such like.  So, I had won that contest and this picture was taken of me to try to--well, to publicize the event but also to try to raise funds for me to go to the NAACP convention which I believe in that year took place in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Ready.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me in Botswana.  I had spent about a few months there as United States Ambassador.  The person here, to the right, was my Deputy Chief of Mission and those two people are visitors.  They were coming to talk to us about the freedom of Namibia and that's in my office in Gaborone.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: That's Nigeria?
Speaker 2: Yes. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm shown there in the office of the cultural center in Nigeria where I was Cultural Affairs Officer for three years and this is one of the intellectuals of Nigeria who came in to greet us and to talk about activities in the country.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  We're going to start at the top.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Start here?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--I returned to Nigeria for the 10th anniversary of a program I started there in honor of President Kennedy.  It was the John F. Kennedy Memorial Essay Contest and it had lasted long after I departed and there's Ambassador Andrew Young there on that trip and the Director of A.I.D. right next to--between Ambassador Young and myself and we were--this is just a picture of us at one of the occasions.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, did you want to skip the top one?
Speaker 1: No, I'll do it.  This is more--this picture is on that occasion of the anniversary of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Essay Contest that I started when I was Cultural Affairs Officer in Nigeria.  They carried it on long after I left.  This is the 10th anniversary and the person to--in the center, is a man named Jack Hedges, he was also a United States Information Agency officer.  He was the head of the operation when I got--returned on this occasion and the man is named Dr. (unclear), he was principal of a college in Nigeria and he had been on the original committee of the essay contest that I started out there.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a--this is the actual program, the audience looking--attending the program that we had in honor of the 10th anniversary of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Essay Contest in Nigeria.  These are mainly Americans that you see in the audience.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: And here we have--at a party given in connection with that anniversary of the essay contest, we have a luncheon or reception given after the program and, of course, I'm on the right there and next to me is the man who was in charge of USIA at the time, a man named Jack Hedges and the Nigerian who is shown there was very active in radio and especially television.  He was one of the persons that started television--got television going in Nigeria and one of the leading persons on--in front of the camera and news activities in Nigeria.  He's there because he was one of those who helped push the idea of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Essay Contest.
Speaker 2: Now this--this is a very proud moment.  It's the swearing in ceremony for me when I was named ambassador to Botswana.  I'm--the system is to--for the assistant secretary or the secretary to swear you in, then you go and sign the Letters of Appointment and then you come back and make remarks about what you--what you plan to do and express your appreciation for the appointment.  And here I am in that role.  My father, who was then very--quite old and blind, actually, attended the ceremony when I presented my credentials.  I don't believe you can see him because he was--he had to sit down.  Let me see.  No, he is not shown there but off to my right, on the stage, would be my family, on this side would be my family, who--all of whom were celebrating during the--this program.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Ready?
Speaker 2: Yes.  This picture is a picture of us in the--in the Philippines where I was named--to which I was named the Consular of Information and Culture after spending three years--several years back in this country and after having served three tours in Africa.  This was a--I'm sorry, that's not right.  I better correct that.  Can we go-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, just correction.
Speaker 2: Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Let me just make sure that I--yes, yes Green.  Ah, C.B. (ph.)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're okay.  That's actually Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Again, a very, very interesting picture here.  This is a scene in Liberia.  After my mother passed away, we came home for the funeral, my wife and I, and we decided that we'd like to have our--my father come back to Africa with us.  He had never been to Africa, of course, and he had never actually ridden on an airplane.  So we took him all the way to Liberia and there he is, right here, and he stayed with us for a month in Monrovia.  These are other officers of the Embassy and there I am, I'm afraid, trying to grow an afro (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: And there's my--my father, standing between two Liberians.  We took him back to Africa after the passing of my mother and he came out and stayed with us for about a month and these are two Liberian ladies that he met on the--one of the tour that we took him on as he was visiting with us in Liberia.
Speaker 2: Often when you--when one in the Information Service and the Diplomatic Services abroad, here is one that is visited by distinguished visitors from Washington.  Often, people in the--supervisors in the service where you are and this is one of those occasions with a man named Leonard Marks, who was director of the United States Information Agency and a very distinguished lawyer in Washington, D.C.  He is visiting with me in Monrovia and there we are at--we greeted him at the airport and we're going back to the office.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a family photo on one of the occasion--one of the reunion occasions that we had in Augusta, Georgia.  So it's basically the Dawsons.  My father is there in the center, here, and he is on--either side is one of his sisters.  He was then 90 years old and one sister is older than he and the other sister is younger than he and the rest of the people in the photo are my sisters and brothers, my siblings, and their offspring.  For example, there I am and this is my brother Leslie, the only one of us--the five of us who's passed away, and this is my cousin, Grady, my sister, Mary Ruth, my other sister, Josephine, and my brother Leonard.  And this is my sister's husband, Claude, and this is the daughter of this brother.  This is Lorraine, that's the daughter of this brother and this is the granddaughter of Leonard, this brother.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Zoom in nice and tight.
Speaker 2: Here we--here we have a photo in Liberia of a visit to Africa by the then head of the United States Information Agency under President Reagan, or actually, President Nixon.  This is Jim Keogh--James Keogh, former editor of "Time Magazine" with his wife.  He is then, at the time the picture was taken, he is the Director of USIA and there am I.  We are surrounded by local people who have made a presentation of one of those wooden chains to the director of United States Information Agency.  Yes, this is in Liberia.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is in the '60's [1960s], right?
Speaker 2: Hum?
Speaker 1: This is in the '60's [1960s], right?
Speaker 2: On the (unclear) years.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, sorry, I missed that part.
Speaker 2: This photo was taken on the day that I presented my credentials as ambassador to the Republic of Botswana.  It's significant because I presented those credentials to the acting president, Quett Masire.  I did that--and I was the first ambassador to not to present his credentials to the founding president of the country, Seretse Khama and that is because Seretse Khama was very, very ill at the time and so because they wanted it to--wanted the presentation to be made as quickly as possible, I presented my credentials to President Quett Masire.  This is the Foreign Minister, the then Foreign Minister of Botswana, Archibald Mogwe, and this is my deputy, Chief of Mission, at the American Embassy.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's Nigeria, right?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Shortly after we arrived in Nigeria, the word came out from the United States, from the State Department, that the president of Lincoln University, which is my university, was going to visit Africa.  He wanted to visit Africa and he wanted especially to visit Nigeria where the president, the then president, was a Lincoln man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Nnamdi Azikiwe.
Speaker 2: That's Nnamdi Azikiwe who is here.  Another Lincoln man was named Mbadiwe, who was the minister of aviation and there were several very distinguished graduates of Lincoln who were doing important things and serving important missions in the government of Nigeria of that day.  And so President Marvin Wachman and his wife decided to--wanted to visit Nigeria.  When President Nnamdi Azikiwe, the then president, who was also a graduate of Lincoln, heard about this, he called--he had a reception, really a big dinner at State House, which is the most important residence in the country, had a reception for President Wachman and invited Lincoln men from all over Africa to come and greet the then president of Lincoln.  And that's a picture of some of us standing on the steps of State House in Lagos where we sang the Lincoln University alma mater, President Azikiwe joining in with us.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of Richard Nixon.  He was then--he had lost the election and was now about testing the waters to see if he should run again, after he said, "You won't have Richard Nixon to kick around any more".  He was then testing the waters and he was making a trip to Liberia and here we are greeting him at a news conference at the airport.  This is the then ambassador there.  His name was Bert Matthews and here am I and other people around are either reporters, or local people, greeting President Nixon.  If I said Liberia, I should not have said Liberia, I should have said Nigeria.  This is Nixon in Nigeria.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Ready?
Speaker 2: Yes.  This is our oldest son, Horace Dawson III receiving his law degree in commencement exercises at Harvard [University].  He attended Harvard undergraduate and then went to a law school and business school.  So he stayed up there eight years and here he is receiving his law degree on commencement day.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Ready?
Speaker 2: This is a picture on one of those social occasions in Botswana and there I am talking with the then president of Botswana, Quett Masire.  He succeeded--Quett Masire succeeded Seretse Khama as president of Botswana and we became very, very close friends.  Seretse Khama died as you know, soon after we arrived in Botswana and this is the man who succeeded him.  And there we are on an occasion in Botswana.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, (unclear).
Speaker 2: This is Seretse Khama, the founding president of Botswana, one of the most famous statesman in Africa.  He, unhappily here, is in his declining years.  You can tell, he has a gaunt look about him but in the--in the almost a year, my being there and knowing him, we became very good friends and I visited with him several times but he died while we were serving our term in Botswana.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Ready?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is the scene at the State Department on the sixth floor after I was named and sworn in as ambassador to Botswana.  This--Assistant Secretary of State administered the oath and this chief of protocol, a man named George Seeley, was there attending and as it turns out, that's my father over on the right-hand side.  He was able to visit on this occasion.  He was--he's been--very elderly, that's why he's sitting down, everybody else out front is standing up but my father was there for this occasion and happily he saw me sworn in as ambassador to Botswana.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: This--this is the presidential flag when a person is named ambassador, he is said to receive--to have received his flag and this is my flag, symbolic of the fact that I, for the presidential appointee, and in fact, the president's envoy to Botswana.  It's something that stands in your office, very large--long version of it and that is on your automobile as you ride around town for your credited.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Ready?
Speaker 2: My brother is--my brother, Leonard, who was president of Voorhees College before he retired, is having a birthday here in 2003, here in this house, and we are shaking hands in the traditional way, congratulating each other, and simply having a great time on his birthday.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Ready?
Speaker 2: Yes, my--my brother and his wife and my brother, who is here, Leonard, and his wife, Laura, and my nephew and his wife, this is Conrad Dawson, the son of my older brother and his wife, are celebrating anniversaries, and this is the daughter of my younger brother, Leonard, and her husband.  All three took their vows a second time here in this living room and there's a magnificent occasion and we are having a party surrounding the event when the retaking of the vows occurred here in our residence in Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 91356
Speaker 1: There in Augusta [Georgia] where we grew up, we had something unusual for the South in those days and that was the community center.  It was known as Bethlehem Community Center.  It was financed and directed by the Methodist Church, women's division of Christian Service of the what is now the United Methodist Church and it was there, right in our neighborhood, in our community, and this is a picture of four of us, members of a cooperative.  They were trying to teach us various things, including business and so this is a cooperative with three people, my generation very dear to me, close friends, selling a few items in this community center.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 1: Is--I would say that took place--this particular picture probably was made in 1942.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is a picture of me in my military uniform.  I was drafted in 1944, served in England and then went to the Philippines and stayed there.  At the end of the War, the atom bomb was dropped in Japan as we were in the--on the ocean headed for the Far East and I--we off-loaded in Manila and that's where I served, and I suspect this is where that picture was taken.  I came home in 1946 and resumed my college career.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Picture of my mother.  She's--I suspect she sent this to me when I was in Military Service.  A picture of her in her younger years.  She loved hats and that's one of the ones, I'm sure, was a favorite of hers.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay and then--
Speaker 2: And this also is a picture of my mother, the same person, at a different stage, an older stage in her life.
Speaker 1: My younger brother--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, then maybe do it then.
Speaker 1: I'd do it if you want.
Speaker 2: Sure, go ahead.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my younger brother who--my younger brother Leonard, who succeeded me in attending Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in high school.  He is here and those are classmates of his at Haines.  Haines was a private school because in those days Augusta did not have public education at that level for black people.  It might surprise you but this--this picture was probably taken around 1947, '48' [1948] and it was only then as--that the school system began to have complete public education for black people.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: This is Louis Lomax.  He is a--my first cousin, the son of my mother's brother.  He went on to--he went to Paine College in Augusta, Georgia and he lived with us while he was attending Paine.  Later went to Savannah State [University] where he finished college and, of course, he later became very important in film, in writing and in film.  He was an early Africanist.
Speaker 1: Yeah, author of "The Negro Revolt" and--
Speaker 2: Yes, author of "The Negro Revolt" and I believe his picture--his most famous film was "A Walk In My Shoes".
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, we're ready for this one.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother.  She--her name is Mary--Mary Smith.  This is an earlier picture.  She was then not married.  She was attending Spelman Normal School, which became Spelman College.  She was a native of Norwood, Georgia, which is where my father was from as well and, as I said, she was at Spelman when this picture was taken but they married in about 1919, soon after he returned from the--from the War.  He served in France and he married his childhood sweetheart.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a picture of me at a very early age, I suppose early '40's [1940s].  If you look very carefully you'll see that I'm wearing the--sort of early stage zoot suit with the--with the pants baggy and narrow at the feet.  I'm standing here by Mt. Zion Baptist Church on Wrightsboro Road in Augusta, Georgia.  This is well before I went to--I was in high school at the time well before I went to the Service.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  And who's this gentleman?
Speaker 1: This is my paternal grandfather, Joseph Henry Dawson.  He--we sort of give him credit for sort of the patriarch of the family.  Of course his mother also was known but he was born into slavery and was--took the family out of slavery when it was--when freedom was declared.  He was a very young man, at the time, about 14, 15 years old and he sort of became the head of the house.  His name is Joseph Henry Dawson.  Here, years later, in the '30s [1930s], as a matter of fact, 1930s, he is shown on--at a house on Wrightsboro Road, the first piece of property bought by any Dawson in Augusta, Georgia, which is the--sort of the place where all Dawsons moved ultimately.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is historic. I just saw it on the wall.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right, ready.
Speaker 1: I'm flanked here by, on the right, Alex Haley, and on the left by Alex's brother, George.  Alex, of course, is famous for having written "Roots".  His brother, [HM George Haley] George, was a lawyer and most recently an ambassador, an ambassador to The Gambia which is where "Roots" was set and here we are together in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: About what year is this?
Speaker 1: This picture was taken, I would say, about 1970, '71' [1971], '72' [1972].
Speaker 2: That's before "Roots" came out?
Speaker 1: It was.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, ready?
Speaker 1: Yes, that's my grandmother--my paternal grandmother, wife of Joseph Henry Dawson.  She was a Lucas.  Her maiden name was Lucas and she also lived in Norwood, Georgia.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: That is my grandfather, probably one of the earliest photographs taken of any part of the family and as you can see, it's almost like a painting.  It's the early days of photography as well.  Joseph Henry Dawson gets credit as a patriarch of the family and a native of Norwood, Georgia and he fathered twelve offspring, including my father.
Story_ID: 91357
Speaker 1: Okay. The first thing we do is slate the interview.  My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: I'm Horace G. Dawson, Jr.  H-O-R-A-C-E, G, and that is for Greeley, G-R-E-E-L-E-Y, Dawson, D-A-W-S-O-N, Jr.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a reason why your father was named Horace Greeley?  I know he was a newspaper editor for the 19th century, right, during the Civil War, white man.  Is there a reason why?
Speaker 2: We've always--I've always wondered why my father was named Horace, after Horace Greeley, obviously was named after Horace Greeley, and the only reason I can come up with is that Horace Greeley, not only was a newspaperman, "New York Herald", but he was a strong Republican.  He was a very important Republican politician and he also had been--he was an anti-slavery advocate.  I mean, he talked about reconstruction and those types of things but he was a very--he was a very important editor and a very important Republican politician.  He's famous for having said, "Go West young man and grow up with the nation."
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is January 30, 1926 and my place of birth is Augusta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, I am now director of the Ralph J. Bunche International Affairs Center at Howard University.  I'm in education which is where I started.  I started out in education, as a teacher, and then I joined the Foreign Service, the Diplomatic Service of the United States and I retired from that in 1989 and went to Howard University, almost the very next day and am back in education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I believe it's June 6, is it not?  June 6th, 2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You're in my living room at 1601 Kalmia Road NW, Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 91358
Speaker 1: All right, now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight "People Magazine"-ish type questions that we always ask and they just require a short answer.  The first question is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  That's a--not that lightweight, I guess, I don't know.  I guess I have to say I like beans.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Perhaps I would say blue.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, there's no question that my favorite time of the year is Spring.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, I think vacations are terribly overrated and I seldom take them unless my wife presses.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Hum.  I--yes I do.  I often say, "We don't mess around".
Story_ID: 91359
Speaker 1: Sir, can you tell me a little bit about your family history.  How far can you trace your family back?
Speaker 2: Well we can go back, really, to my--to my grandfather, that's the first substantive point.  Of course, we know a bit about his mother who was the one who was victimized by the slave master in Norwood, Georgia but we know very little about her other than her name and so on.  My grandfather sort of was the one with whom the history begins and it was in, as I said, in Norwood, Georgia that he moved his family away from the Wicker, W-I-C-K-E-R, Plantation and started the family which became known as Dawson later on, was he, we think, my grandfather who changed the name from Wicker to Dawson and we're not quite sure why he choose that particular name but he certainly wanted to move away from the Wicker name that he associated with the institution of slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories that he told about life in the--
Speaker 2: That's mainly the story that he told.  You see, he was very young, probably no more than fourteen or fifteen when slavery was declared ended and he didn't talk much about that at all.  He talked mainly about his occupation which was that of a well-digger in and around Norwood, Georgia and about, and he was quite a person who liked to do a lot of joking and teasing but was not much for recounting earlier stages of his life.
Speaker 1: And I think you said at some point, before we started, that Mr. Wicker was a very--was sort of a mean--
Speaker 2: That's right.  He--that's the one story that, as I said, that he told and that was Wicker was quite a mean and cruel person to the people he owned as slaves and as soon as he could do so, Joseph Henry Dawson wanted to make sure that he himself moved himself, as well as the family, away from that name, Wicker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were born as Wickers, of course, because they inherited the name of the plantation and so once that relationship was ended, he wanted to change the name to symbolize the freedom that he now had.
Speaker 1: Okay, once moved to Augusta, Georgia, your father was one of the children--
Speaker 2: Yes, the family sort of left Norwood in stages, of course, and re-established, first of all, in Augusta, they--representatives of it moved out in later years but the first place that most of them moved to, including my father, one of the earliest to do so, was Augusta, Georgia, not very, very far from Norwood but, in fact, an urban area.
Story_ID: 91360
Speaker 1: Now, tell us your father's full name and--
Speaker 2: His name is Horace Greeley Dawson, Sr., I'm a Junior, of course, and I'm named the same except for that.
Speaker 1: Now when was your father born?
Speaker 2: My father was born about 1894, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did he do and what was he like?
Speaker 2: My father was a, what is known as a call clerk, at Railway Express Company.  That's the person who takes the packages off the trucks, all out of cars and so on, weighs them and then sees that they are put on the train to be moved from one city to another.  In those days, most of the transportation in this country, of goods, was by way of rail, not by trucks.  The trucks replaced--the arrival of the truck meant the end of the, pretty much, the Railway Express Company, which is where my father spent his entire life.  And so that's what he did.  He came to Augusta, almost immediately was employed by Railway Express, his service there was interrupted by going to the--to the War--to the Army about 1917 and then he--when he returned, 1918, 1919 from the War in Europe, he went to France by the way, and that's where he served overseas.  When he came back from there, he re-established himself in Augusta and with the Railway Express Company, where he spent the remainder of his life.  His total employment throughout his life was with the Railway Express Company.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what kind of person was your father?  What was he like?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a formidable character.  He was very demanding of us but more than that he was demanding of himself.  He--this job that he had, he was dedicated to.  He probably had a record for almost perfect attendance throughout the time that he was there and also there was no lateness in connection with his work.  And he tried to inculcate those types of things in us, the dutifulness, and that type of thing.  He had a great interest in education and wanted to see to it that all of his children were--received education.  He was a long-time member throughout his life of Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church.  He was an officer there, head of the senior board of stewards, probably for forty to fifty years and he was also secretary of the church.  And saw to it that we children, all five of us, attended there as well.  He believed in--in the value of work.  He wanted to make sure that all of us were occupied and gainfully so from the very beginning but nothing, nothing, nothing, stood in the way of education, that was the thing that he dedicated his life to.

Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your mother.  What was her full name and what is her date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mary Bell Smith. In the first instance, she later became Dawson and, of course, Mary Bell Dawson.  And she was born also in Norwood, Georgia.  I won't dare try to give you the date.  She never let us--she never shared that with us but she was born in Norwood, Georgia.  She was a very talented person, very capable of learning and very eager to learn.  In fact, she attended Spelman College in the very early days, Spelman in Atlanta, when Spelman was probably a normal school.  She was preparing to be a teacher and when my father [Horace G. Dawson, Sr.] came back from the War in 1918 or '19' [1919], the two of them were married and, of course, that put an end to her pursuit of education and of this teaching career that she wanted because he insisted that she stay home.  They agreed, I guess, that she would stay home.
Speaker 1: I just wanted to ask you, if--did she come from a family of means or was it a struggle for her to get to Spelman?
Speaker 2: That's a very good question.  I would not say that it was a family of means, I would say that they were beginning, as a family in Norwood, my mother's family, was beginning as a family, to acquire property.  They were--everybody was poor, of course, but it was a time when--when senior brothers and sisters got together and pooled their resources and invested them for educational purposes in one person who showed the most likely ability to succeed and that's what happened in that case.  I do think that they were probably beginning to acquire some means because they did later on do so.
Story_ID: 91362
Speaker 1: You were telling us about your mother.  I was asking you about Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  If they really had means or did she--was an exceptional student.  I mean, how did she get to Spelman?
Speaker 2: Yes, as far as I know, they--the brothers and sisters gathered their resources and saw to it that she went to Spelman because they felt that she had the talent and the wherewithal to succeed.  So it was a family affair but then I must say, as I have done, that the family did acquire substance as they went along and this probably represented the beginning of that history.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  You have to be fairly exceptional to go to college in those days--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you represent a family sacrifice, that's what I want to ask.
Speaker 2: It was--it was, it did represent family sacrifice.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did your parents meet?  Did they talk about how they met or did they have a story about that?
Speaker 2: Well, they--of course they grew up in the same, what they call settlements, I guess--
Speaker 1: What was hard not to be?
Speaker 2: I'm not going to say city, of course, what they call settlements in that area of Georgia and they knew each other as youngsters, probably in church situations and family situations and so on.  I think there was nothing extremely traumatic or anything about how they got to know each other.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what was your mother like?  What kind of person was she?
Speaker 2: Well, she was what that--housewife in the very purest sense of the word, she was a steadying influence, she was the one who looked after the youngsters and she was one who looked forward to her husband coming home.  She didn't expect to, herself, go out and do anything, it was he who did all of that and she was a housewife, as I said.  She was a very loving person, extremely mild-mannered and soft-spoken and caring person.  She kept up with what all of us were doing and always enjoyed hearing about the school day and what activities we were involved in and she kept check on those.  I mean, she really was a housewife and mother in the purest sense of the word, and a loving person.  Everybody, not just in our house but in the entire community, thought of her as a loving person with a great, great, great pleasant personality.
Story_ID: 91363
Speaker 1: Okay, I think I've heard that your grandfather was partial to you and one of your female cousins?
Speaker 2: Yes, he--I'm not quite sure why but he seemed to have a--have us as his favorite.  My--the daughter of his youngest daughter, her name was Evelyn, and I were the ones that he seemed to care most about and he saw to it that we were always doing exactly what we should have been doing.  He would take us to school, hold us by the hand, and take us to school and pick us up and bring us back.  He was a very, again, a person who cared a great deal.  He was also, I suspect, a man with a roving eye, even at that age, as I remember so well.  He--the only thing he would--that would cause him to interrupt our trip to school was when a lovely woman passed by.  He would stop dead in his track and look around (laughter).
Story_ID: 91364
Speaker 1: Okay. Well can you reflect back on growing up in Augusta [Georgia] and tell us what was some of the sights, some of the sounds, some of the smells, of growing up.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  We--we--most of our life as youngsters was connected with being in school.  Whenever a Dawson child reached school age, even kindergarten age, he or she was off and doing that and so once that process started, you were always involved with the school as your center of your life.  And then when vacation time came, there were always activities for us connected with the community center.  As I said, we had one of the few community centers in--in that area, the South.  At the time, it was run by the Methodist Church and it was called, Bethlehem Community Center.  And so they had clubs for us.  They had all kinds of activities.  Daily vacation bible school, and then the church had Saturday bible school and so we were always occupied in doing something.  There was no leisure.  At a very early age, I began to sell newspapers and you talk about the sounds, I was certainly privy to and experienced those sounds because I had a bicycle and drove all the way over--all over town from the time, I guess, I was twelve or so years old until I went off to high school, delivering weekly newspapers, "Pittsburgh Courier" being the main one.
Story_ID: 91365
Speaker 1: Yes, I probably had the largest weekly distribution of "Pittsburgh Courier" in the country.  I carried them all over Augusta [Georgia].  By the time I stopped, I was carrying a couple of thousand "Pittsburgh Couriers" a week, all over town with my bicycle.  And, indeed, that's how I paid my way through--through high school.  In those days, we did not have public education at that level in Augusta, Georgia.  I'm speaking now of the--as late as the '40s [1940s].  You could go to--to elementary school, say to eighth grade, but then once you did that, you had to--your parents had to pay for you to go to high school and there were several--two or three private high schools in Augusta, they were church run affairs such as the Walker Baptist High School College, Paine High School College and then Haines [Normal and Industrial Institute].  I finished as an honor student from elementary school--public school, and was awarded a scholarship to go to Haines and--for the first year and I, as I said, I was able to--to pay my way for the rest of the way by selling newspapers in Augusta.  As for those sights and sounds, it was a very--staying in my neighborhood, it was a very, sort of warm and interesting life that I was leading.  I used to do items for the--for the local newspaper from the community.  They had a separate page called, "The Colored Page" in those days and we had--I could do--I was able to write about what was happening in the community and put--have items in both the newspapers, "The Augusta Chronicle" and the "Augusta Herald" and also a black newspaper, "The Echo", which was put out by a man named Simmons, down on Gwinnett Street.  So I had an experience as a journalist, at a very, very early age and maintained that interest into adulthood.  So I was always busy doing things.  I was an officer in this club, an officer in that club, certainly connected with teenage clubs and even before that with boys and girls clubs, both at the Bethlehem Community Center and at the schools that I went to.
Story_ID: 91366
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell me about the Boy Scouts.  Were you involved in Boy Scouts?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had--very interesting.  We had a number of boys scout troops in Augusta, Georgia.  First of all, there were the white troops across town but then various churches had troops of boys scouts, it was looked upon as very good character training for the boys and later on for the girls and Bethlehem Center had a troop, my Troop Number 42.  There was only one big problem with scouting for black--African American boys and that is in order to be a first class scout you had to pass a swimming test, you had to get a swimming merit badge, a badge, and there was no swimming pool, none in the community for--that we could go to.  And so most of us never got above the second class scouting because we couldn't learn to swim, we couldn't test it.  Some--few were able to go over to South Carolina which had the same problem, of course, but there were--you couldn't, you know, you couldn't pass the test in a creek.  You couldn't pass the test in a swimming hole, it had to be a regulation pool and we just didn't have the facilities to do that.  So that was very interesting but anyways, scouting was interesting.  We did hikes.  We did summer camp.  We went to jamborees at regional and national levels.  It was--it was a strong movement in Augusta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Now were they--these segregated jamborees in outings?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  Scouting had two tracks, as everything else did in the South at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The black scouts and the white scouts.  I remember their very first executive director of scouting for black boys, his name was John Harold Roberts and he had been the scout master of our Troop 42 at Bethlehem Center.  He was a graduate of Paine College, the local college there.  But to answer your question directly, yes, it was a segregated system.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is Paine College, P-A-Y-N-E?
Speaker 2: P-A-I-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, it was named for--
Speaker 2: It was named for a Bishop in the United Methodist Church, white.  Paine was in the first instance a product of the endowed by, and supported by, the white Methodist Church as were many of the "H"--Historically Black Colleges and Universities of the South, either by the missionary wing of those churches or by some branch such as was true in the case of Bethlehem Center that I just mentioned a while ago, the women's division of Christian Service, something like that.  But Paine was supported by the white Methodist Church and later was joined in that support by the C.M.E. Church, what is called now the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.  So they--together now, those two churches, one black, one white, support Paine College.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's not to be confused with the Payne and Wilberforce [University], with the P-A-Y-N-E?
Speaker 2: No, no, that Wilberforce, that's a theological seminary which is named for Bishop Payne, who was an A.M.E. Bishop, that's P-A-Y-N-E, yes.
Story_ID: 91367
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, tell me about school.  What school did you attend and what did you first attend?  What were the names of your grade schools?
Speaker 2: Right, my first schooling that I knew was kindergarten and that was at Bethlehem Community Center.  All of us in my family went to kindergarten.  I guess we started at age five and spent some time in kindergarten.  And then after that, I went to, what was then called Maude, M-A-U-D-E, Street School.  I started there and later went to--because the--after the--with [Great] Depression--with Depression in the money, public schools were built--I mean, more substantial schools were built.  The first school, this Maude Street School was a wooden structure with heaters with, you know, with coal heaters in the center of the floor, at the front of the room, and so on.  It was a wood structure.  It was succeeded in [Franklin D.] Roosevelt years by this brick building, the first brick building for a school in Augusta [Georgia], was called C. T. Walker.  It was named for an outstanding minister, Charles T. Walker Elementary School, right on my street.  And so I attended that school from third grade on through the seventh, when I was graduated.  And then I went to, as I said, public education cut off at that point and I entered Haines Institute, which was a private--privately funded school.  It had been supported and was supported to an extent by the Presbyterian Church and by fees and that sort of thing, that they were able to muster to keep it going.  And so I attended high school there and once I left Haines, which was in 1943--
Speaker 1: I don't want to get too far into this yet until I ask a few questions about school--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but you graduated in '43' [1943].  Now, how was Haines spelled, again?
Speaker 2: H-A-I-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, I-N-E-S, okay, that was high school.  Tell me like, what kind of student were you in school?
Speaker 2: Student?
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Pretty good.  I finished all of these schools with honors, that's why I was able to--to really to go on to the next level.  I was a salutatorian, I believe, at--at the--no, I was valedictorian from the elementary school and salutatorian from the high school, with all of--and then I--having a--I was very conscientious and my parents saw to it that I didn't slack, I studied, very good.
Story_ID: 91368
Speaker 1: Well, what were your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: English, always English.  I liked to--to--I liked the sound of words.  I liked to write and I was pretty good, believe it or not, even at grammar.  So, I--English was my very favorite--very favorite subject.  High school was sort of a classic--classical one where they taught us Latin and Trigonometry, Geometry, subjects of that type which was characteristic of those private high schools in those days.  And so I--I must say I didn't care for the Trigonometry and subjects like that, but English was always my favorite topic--subject.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there particular authors that you read that you were inspired by?  Poets or prose writers?
Speaker 2: At that level, you know, we--I didn't have favorite authors as such.  We went--I guess I fell in love, one with--as they were introduced, one after the other.  The--looking back, I think it was really the romantic ones such as [George Gordon] Byron and [John] Keats that attracted my interest most.  But at that time when we were learning poetry and having to commit certain--a number of poems to memory and experimenting and explaining and talking about subjects--talking subjects, I guess it was just one author after another with whom I fell in love.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, at school, were you exposed to much black history and culture?
Speaker 2: In Augusta, Georgia, at that time, every student in this high school, and in any of the private high schools, had to complete what was known as "Negro History".  There was a complete subject that was taught and there was no way to finish high school without having that.  Yes, and so the answer to your question is very much so.  We knew about the figures such as Paul Robeson and W. E. B. Du Bois and Bishop McNeal Turner--Henry McNeal Turner and we knew all of these figures.  You asked me earlier on about George  Schuyler, you began to be introduced to people like that at a very early age through black history.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there a standard text?  Were you studying from Carter Woodson or somebody or was there--was it left to the teacher to come up with a curriculum?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I--when I was in high school, mind you we're talking about now, we're talking about '39' [1939] to '43' [1943], I don't recall that there was a standard text but there was all kind of material that the teachers made available to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't--there was not a standard text, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But with a rich supply of information that was acquired from, I suppose, one book here, one book there, church sources, magazines and different sources of information that were--was available.
Story_ID: 91369
Speaker 1: Okay, now what activities were you involved in in school?  Were you involved in--'cause I know you were busy.  You were an entrepreneur with the papers and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we have club activities such as the English Language Club and I was always, always associated with the newspaper and the yearbook.  Those were--those were my favorite activities.  I wasn't much at sports although I did try in high school to play basketball, a bit short for that even then but such clubs as the French Club and the English Club and the--whatever.  I was also a class officer so I always had that activity going as well.  I was, for example, I was president of my class, the Class of '43 [1943] from the sophomore year until graduation.  In fact, I was invited back to be the speaker on our 50th anniversary a few years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell me, who were some of the teachers or administrators or adults in your community or school that served as mentor to you or model?
Speaker 2: At--at this high school, we had two--we had the principal and the assistant principal, a man whose name was the Reverend Augustus Cummings Griggs was the principal.  He had been a Lincoln [University] man.  He had gone to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and graduated there, as had the man who taught mathematics, his name was John Tutt.  He also was a Lincoln man and he was a coach of the football team and of the basketball team.  Both of them were Lincoln graduates and both of them served as real role models for me in almost everything they did, Reverend Griggs as a great speaker, public occasions and as a thoughtful organizer, Mr. Tutt as a kind of entrepreneur and disciplinarian and hard worker.  I'll tell you, I would not have gone to college at Lincoln had it not been for these two.  My brothers and sisters, my siblings, went to Paine College, right there at home.  I was the first of the family to leave home to go away to college.  The same thing I can say about going away to work.  When I left home the first time to get a job in order to go to college, I went to Narragansett Pier [Rhode Island] as a bellhop in a hotel and Mr. Tutt was the one who made arrangements for that.  He had a kind of a, I would say, a placement agency for boys like ourselves who could go North--go to New York, go to New England and get jobs in hotels and on the cruise ships, Hudson Bay steamers.
Story_ID: 91370
Speaker 1: Okay, so--well tell me about--before we leave high school now, you have a famous cousin, Louis Lomax.  Was he--were you all about the same age or--
Speaker 2: No, Louis was older than I.  He was closer to my brother who is six years older than I am.  I would say Louis is probably four to five years older than I.  His--he was the son of my mother's brother, my mother's younger brother.  He was born in a place called Valdosta, Georgia and came--when time came to go to college, he came to Augusta [Georgia] and lived in our house and attended Paine College for a couple of years and then he went off to Savannah.  I believe he went to Georgia State [University] in Savannah [Georgia] and finished his--his work there.  But, yes, we were first cousins and we were very, very close.  Louis later, as you know, went off to New York and became involved in film and in writing and so on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 91371
Speaker 1: So when you were on the verge of graduating from high school, did you know exactly--did you--well you had made arrangements to go to Lincoln [University in Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And you were bound for Lincoln University?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I--it was understood that I would go to college.  My father [Horace G. Dawson, Sr.] didn't raise any issue--questions about that.  He just--you automatically went from high school to college.  And normally it was good to go to Paine [College, Augusta, Georgia], which is right there in our hometown.  In fact, only about ten minutes walk from our front door.  But I said to him that I'd like to go to Lincoln.  These mentors over at Haines had suggested that I should go to Lincoln.  You know, I should be a Lincoln man.  And he said, well I cannot afford that.  I can't afford to send you away.  Lincoln had given me what was in those days called a scholarship but, of course, not very much money was involved and Lincoln was significantly more expensive than Paine and besides which my father couldn't maneuver in Augusta and he couldn't maneuver in Pennsylvania.  So I said to him, listen, why don't you give me the same amount of money to go to Lincoln, or wherever that you would have given my brother and my sister to go to Paine, and I'll make up the difference.  He thought about that for a few minutes and said, well, that's fair enough.  And so he did.  But--and that year--that summer before I went to Lincoln, that was the first time I went away to--to work.  And as I said, I went to Narragansett Pier and was a bellhop in a hotel up there, Narragansett--I mean the Massasoit Hotel.  Made lots and lots of money.  So, he never had to pay his part of the bargain and he loved to tell that story over and over again that I had made that bargain with him but he didn't have to live up to his side of it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how did you like Lincoln University?  How did you like it?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a great experience.  I started at Lincoln in '43 [1943], September, '43 [1943], was called away to the Service in '44 [1944], I left in the spring of '44 [1944]--I left Lincoln in order to get ready to get to the Service in '44 [1944].  In other words, my education was interrupted.
Speaker 1: Did you finish your freshman year?
Speaker 2: I did not finish the freshman year.  I finished one semester, started into the second and did not finish.  In those days, everybody was going off to the Service and, you know, you didn't resist, you sort of felt strange if you were eighteen and were--and not in the service.  All of your peers had gone.  But Lincoln, as you know, probably know, was an all men's school.  So the draft practically decimated our student population, only the older boys were--were in school at Lincoln.  I guess we were down to 150 people from all of the country at Lincoln.  Anyways, I went away in the spring of '44 [1944], and stayed in the Service for two years and four days and came back and returned to Lincoln and finished.  It was a great, great experience.  Best thing I ever did and one of the most wonderful experiences I could have had in college as far as I'm concerned and I'm eternally grateful for the time I was able to spend in that very, very wonderful college in Pennsylvania.  A small, small town setting, rural really, but an enjoyable place.
Story_ID: 91372
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, just briefly, what did you do in the service?  Where did you go to?
Speaker 2: I was in--really I was in, as most of us where, I was in a Quartermaster Service Company and I trained in Illinois, Camp Ellis, and then went to Britain, I went to England, and stayed--we were about ready to go over to France in '45' [1945] and when the War [World War II] ended in Europe we were preparing to take off for France when the War--had gone to Portsmouth to take off.  And then we all rejoiced because we said, now we're going back home but instead we were--hadn't been in the Service all that long, less than two years, and so they sent us, my company, to Asia and we were to go to Japan and while we were en route to Japan, through the Panama Canal from Britain, the atom bomb was dropped at Hiroshima and instead of turning around and bringing us back to the U.S., we--they kept going and we landed in the Philippines, in Manila.  My first trip to Asia and my first trip to the Philippines.  I later returned as a diplomat to the Philippines but that was the first trip during the War.  So, yes, we stayed there for about eight or nine months and I--by that time I had accumulated enough points to be discharged from the service and I was, in June of '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 91373
Speaker 1: At Lincoln [University in Pennsylvania]--back at Lincoln now, what did you major in?
Speaker 2: English.
Speaker 1: English?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And who were some of the teachers there and personalities that stuck out?
Speaker 2: Well, my major professor was a man named Joseph Newton Hill and in those days you had characters like this who had spent their entire lives, they were very, very brilliant, they spent their entire lives in settings such as Lincoln and they'd become identified with the institution.  He had an Oxford accent and a very demanding person.  He taught Shakespeare.  He taught Dryden and he was a very inspiring figure.  He made English come alive.  He made the characters come alive.  You had to enjoy and know the plays of Shakespeare in order to--it was just simply a great--it was demanded of you to know all that.  And so, yes, Joe Hill was a--was a mentor of mine.  Horace Mann Bond was the first African American to be president of Lincoln.  Lincoln had been started--was the first institution of higher learning, the first college to be founded in this country for the education of blacks and that was done in 1854.  And until that--until Horace Mann Bond came in 1945 or '46' [1946], probably the year that I got back, he had--all the presidents had been white and Horace Mann Bond, as I said, was the first.  And he was a very inspirational figure.  He had a tremendous intellect.  He seemed, in my view, he knew everything.  He just seemed to know everything that needed to be known.  He was a great writer, great speaker.  He did the history of Lincoln before he--while he was president there.  A great scholar.  And so he was a mentor as well.  And then I had two professors who had spent their--the War years, those years that I was in the Service, they had spent those years back here, probably in what later came to be known as "camps" because they were conscientious objectors.  They were members of the American Friends.  They were a community of friends and both were products of Yale [University].  One was a man named David Swift and another, a man named Joel Dirlam.  Dirlam taught Economics, Swift taught Religion and they were mentors of mine.  I came to admire them a great deal as well.  And finally I would point to Waters Turpin who was a novelist and a great, great lecturer and a demanding teacher of writing, composition.  He wrote a novel called, "These Low Grounds", several novels, as a matter of fact, not great novels particularly, I mean, they didn't attain--they weren't best sellers but they were certainly fine books.  He had been on the faculty at Morgan State [University] and now was teaching at Lincoln when I was--when I was there.  So Waters Turping--Turpin certainly was a great mentor for me.
Story_ID: 91374
Speaker 1: Sir, are there any other teachers that stand out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think--I think those would--those are the standout teachers for me at Lincoln [University in Pennsylvania].  Once again, keep in mind we're talking about a very small institution and a very small faculty.  I should have mentioned, though, Dean Frank Wilson, who taught both education and religion and although he was not my teacher, I never had a class with him, he--I was often in touch with him in the activities such as fraternal--fraternity organization because he also served as Dean of Students--Dean of Men, so I was in touch with him and therefore he was really a great inspiration.  He encouraged me and I might say to be in the fraternity that I'm in, he was an Alpha man and so am I.  And he was, as I said, a very fine person, a splendid example.  I worked for a man named James Bonner MacRae, M-A-C-R-A-E, he was a North Carolinian.  He also was a professor of education and he was Director of Public Relations and he brought me into his office, as I told you, I was always involved with the journalism side of the house, he brought me into his office as a writer and I did most of the sports reporting for Lincoln [University] athletic teams.  And so, of course, I worked very closely with James B. MacRae.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of our teachers, by the way, with the exception of one, were men.  Lincoln was strictly all-men's school.  It--as you probably know, was theoretically the black Princeton [University].  It was founded by Presbyterian ministers who had attended Princeton and resented the idea that blacks could not go to Princeton and so they founded a substitute--they founded Lincoln University which was modeled on Princeton as an all-male school.
Story_ID: 91375
Speaker 1: Now did you have any--much contact with any of the international students at Lincoln [University]?  I know there are some famous ones who were in school there at one time or another.  Nnamdi Azikiwe is one, of course, and everybody knows him.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did Kwame Nkrumah, I think, too went to school there.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes.  Lincoln had a great tradition of international--African students, really.  I mean, it was only African--primarily African students from abroad.  Lincoln had this great tradition and they had Kwame Nkrumah, as you said was a graduate there--was a student there, in fact he was a teacher there.  Before him there was Nnamdi Azikiwe.  Actually, Zik was probably among the first, certainly the first great ones, to go to Lincoln and was a life-long love affair between Zik and Lincoln University.  So he was there back in the '30's [1930s] with Thurgood Marshall and in that group.  In fact, I believe, they were classmates, Thurgood Marshall and Nnamdi Azikiwe.  And then Nkrumah came a bit later.  Zaru [ph.] from Nigeria, Bodewe (ph.) from Nigeria, a long list of African students there.  Lincoln was among the first to admit African students.  And you ask if I were acquainted with any, yes, I was acquainted with those that were there in my day--in my day.  In fact, I was more often than not the person to greet and to become friendly with the African students as they came.  I remember most memorably a man named Edward W. Blyden, Edward Wilmot Blyden, III, who was the descendant of the great Blyden of Africa.  He was from Sierra Leone and we were so close that we called each other by the same name that Lincoln men call people from their hometown in their states, I called him my "State Boy" and we, even today, address each other in that way.  He calls me "State", I call him "State".  So I was, yes, the international students--the African students were friendly.
Speaker 1: Is he still alive?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Blyden is out in Sierra--back in Sierra Leone right now.  He came to this country, I mean, he's in and out of the United States.  He was Sierra Leone's, I believe at the Foreign Minister for a while.  He certainly taught at Fourah Bay College, the university there for a while.  He taught in--at the university founded by Zik in Nigeria, the University of Nigeria, in Nsukka.  He taught there for a while and then Ed became a Sierra Leone's ambassador to the Soviet Union as it then was.  He was there for several years and he's married to an American, he has several, very, very accomplished off-spring, one of whom is teaching here at Georgetown [University] and--
Speaker 1: Is that a son or daughter?
Speaker 2: That's a daughter.
Speaker 1: Daughter, oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And there are several of the black kids around one PhD scientist out in California that I know of right now.  So I can put my hand on Blydens.  We maintained that friendship over the years and--but he's back in Sierra Leone now.  He very dramatically says he wants to--to die in his own country.  Blyden is older than I.  He came to Lincoln rather at a--not, at the age of a freshman such as I was when I got there, eighteen, he probably was ten years older than that when he came to Lincoln.
Speaker 1: Now, he's the grandson of the great Edward Wilmot Blyden?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  I hesitate like that because there's some disagreement among people on that subject but he certainly is in that family and he's named for the old man.  Whether he named himself by the old man or whether he was named by the old man, I don't know.  But he is Edward Wilmot Blyden III and he has written extensively on Edward Wilmot Blyden.
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, is he--Sierra Leone, there's so much turmoil now, I just hope he's safe there, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, that's why we were all so concerned when he insisted upon going back.  See, they have a family home there in Freetown and that's where he is, that's where Blyden is.  Blyden left Lincoln and went to Harvard [University] and that's where he earned his Doctorate in Anthropology and he's had a very interesting life.  He's an older man now and, as I said, back in Sierra Leone.  One of his daughters went back because he insisted upon going back.  She went back out there to look after him.
Story_ID: 91376
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's interesting.  That's, you know, so you were developing these--the skills of a diplomat.  Were they being developed consciously or unconsciously?
Speaker 2: Well I had an interest--I had an interest in things international.  I've always did a lot of reading and had interest in other parts of the world.  I didn't--no, I was not trying to be a diplomat, I can say that because at the time I had no idea about going into Diplomatic Service, it was something that didn't cross my horizon.  State Department was just something far removed from any of us at that time.  I didn't become interested--I didn't really become definitely interested in and thinking that I could probably do diplomatic work until I went off to work on a doctorate and that was long after I had started a teaching career.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well when you graduated from Lincoln, when was it when you graduated from Lincoln?
Speaker 2: Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 1: Forty-nine [1949], okay.
Speaker 2: They just called and told me that my 60th anniversary (laughter) was occurring--I guess it's the 60th, if not the 55th or something.  Anyway, I have an anniversary coming up next year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be the 55th.
Speaker 2: Fifty-fifth [55th], yes.
Speaker 1: As one who's born in '49 [1949] can attest to (laughter).  So, so--what did you decide to do?  Did you decide to go to graduate school next?  Or what did--
Speaker 2: I did.  One of those professors, David Swift, encouraged me to go to Columbia [University] to go to graduate school immediately and not to tarry.  So I went to Columbia and studied English and comparative literature and where I got my masters in Columbia School of Philosophy and Science.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what were the highlights of that experience at Columbia?  Now you're at New York City now at this time?
Speaker 2: Yes, well I'd gone to New York before when I went to--before Lincoln, when I went to Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island, I'd always stop in New York where my--I had an uncle and an aunt.  I lived there, at their house, during the summers sometimes and I had become familiar with New York and loved it.  I just loved the place.  At Columbia, though, I, and I--I lived there with my uncle and it was mainly an intellectual experience, working hard, trying to finish a degree, I was on the G.I. Bill of Rights and meeting people who were in--doing the same thing that I was doing, studying in the--in the field trying to finish--complete degrees--a degree, and that's basically what I was doing.  I was not a part of the--of the campus as such because I didn't live on the campus, as such, but it was a very stimulating intellectual environment.
Speaker 1: Where did you live?
Speaker 2: I lived with my--at my uncle's house which was across the park on 122nd Street at Morningside.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--
Speaker 2: I mean at Manhattan Avenue, across the park.
Speaker 1: Is that in Harlem--that's in Harlem--
Speaker 2: In Harlem, yes, in Harlem.  Then you had to--you'd go through the park--you cross the park and you're over there at Morningside Heights.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, I lived with my uncle.
Story_ID: 91377
Speaker 1: And as I said, I was busy trying to finish.  But now, this is the--these are the days we're talking about '49 [1949], '50 [1950] when the Cold War is heating up, the day of the communist and all that sort of thing.  And that was a very prominent part of life in New York and particularly in the Columbia area where you would have these cells and organizations trying to recruit people for--to communism.  I went to any number of activities like that and to parties and so on, not quite knowing what was going on, really, but being caught up in the spirit of the times because it was highly intellectual and highly enjoyable and so on.  And I always found myself being elected to be a delegate somewhere (laughter).  I only had to give my name and say I was "Horace Dawson" and I'm over here in the School of Philosophy and Science, getting a degree in English and boom, I was elected to be a delegate to the such and such a people's convention in Chicago.  I worried about that too when in later life I was in the Foreign Service and I was subjected to these investigations to determine my fitness for Foreign Service, security checks is what they're called.  And so I worried about that kind of past would have caught up with me.  It never did.  I guess because I never really was taking much of a part in these things.  I was just a delegate and came back to New York.
Speaker 2: Well, people were less than that and got implicated.
Speaker 1: I tell you.
Speaker 2: It's a--now those are tricky times.
Speaker 1: Very much so, very much so.  Ben Davis was very much in the news and all of the well-known communists.  You could have black communist you could identify were--
Speaker 2: I think [HM] Angela Davis and others in New York?
Speaker 1: Yes, Mother--
Speaker 2: I don't know, John Henrik Clarke, who's associated at one time with (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: I wasn't acquainted with him at all in that light at that time.  The daily work was always something that you got at your door.  So, it was an interesting time.  But really, I didn't have too much time for that kind of activity, although I enjoyed some of the meetings and discussions.  You're always invited to a discussion and when you got there, the topic was, the women's question, the black--the Negro question, the--this question, that.  So that was always--
Speaker 2: Did you run into Bayard Rustin or--
Speaker 1: Yes indeed, yes indeed.  Not so much in New York as places like Lincoln and the college campuses.  Bayard would travel a lot and lecture and that's how you really ran into him.  You could, in New York too, he'd lecture at some of these gatherings.
Speaker 2: Was Ella Baker a prominent figure in these meetings?
Speaker 1: Vaguely, the name, vaguely, vaguely, I don't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I know, also, at the same time, they were trying to form the United Nations, with Ralph Bunche and Dr. Channing Tobias and other people--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --who were prominent in Harlem, you know.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Did you run across any of that discussion or activity?
Speaker 1: Oh, indeed, yes.  Channing Tobias is an interesting figure.  He was associated in my time with the YMCA and also he was on the board of Paine College.  He may well have been a graduate of Paine College, I think, but I would see him in my hometown.  You see, we had that experience with Channing Tobias.  Yes, I saw those figures very much.
Speaker 2: Okay, now he worked on a U.N.--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: --he's with Ralph--Dr. Ralph Bunche?
Speaker 1: Right.  Bunche--then--is now--was sort of a very quiet background figure.  You just didn't know much about Bunche in those days.  He came--was much better known later and, of course, renowned but he was more of a background figure at the time.
Speaker 2: Right, there's a filmmaker in New York that we interviewed named [HM] William Greaves, a long movie--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --about the life of Dr. Ralph Bunche.
Speaker 1: Yes.  No, I know Bill Greaves and I'm aware of the film and we've seen it.  In fact, we'll have him come down and speak to our students in a few days.
Story_ID: 91378
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, after your experience in--anything else about Columbia [University, New York City, New York]?  Or that experience--
Speaker 2: No, no, you know, I was--I must say that I went to Columbia and got through it in a hurry.  I did a master's in nine months and as soon as I could get out of there, I went and took my first job.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was your first job?
Speaker 2: It was teaching English at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My first job.  I stayed--
Speaker 1: Yeah, how did you like that?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed it.  I was a very good teacher, I thought.  In fact, I was very--that was the most exciting thing that I'd ever done, teaching, and I've--I decided then and there that I was going to pursue this for the rest of my life.  We--a very interesting thing happened in--when I was about ready to leave--when I left--had left Columbia [University in New York City, New York].  This was a--one of those periods of depression in New York and I had written around for jobs but what I really wanted--when I came out in June, was a job to make enough money to let me stay in New York City for the rest of the summer, until I took up my job at Southern in the fall.  Well, I could hardly find a job.  I couldn't find a job.  People said, you're too well educated for this and you don't have enough specifics and training for that.  So, I went to the Methodist, just on a whim, practically, I went to the--to the Methodist headquarters on Fifth Avenue and looked up the woman who had headed this Community Center in Augusta, Georgia when I was a kid, her name was Thelma Stevens.
Speaker 1: The Bethlehem Community Center?
Speaker 2: The Bethlehem Community Center, the Bethlehem Community Center.  I looked her up and I--she was there, she was then handling women's division of Christian Service and I told her my story and she said, wait a minute, and picked up the phone and the next thing I knew, I was working in the reproduction office of the Methodist headquarters.  So that was a great experience.  Then, while that was--and then after that, the New York passed its first mandatory automobile insurance law and they were getting policies--everybody had to have a policy by a certain time.  And so these policies had to be typed and that's one thing I can do in life, I can type, I am a very good typist.  So, I--somehow I found out about this and was hired by Kemper Insurance Company, which was writing a number of policies in automobile insurance that summer.  And so I worked for them.  They gave me extra work to take home and do.  I worked on the weekends and so on and really made a great name at the Kemper.  And while all of this was going--when it ended, they called me in, somebody called me in and said, look, we've watched you throughout the summer, we've seen the work you do, we know how conscientious you are, we'd like you to come and work for us.  And without even asking what the salary would be, what my job would be, and so on, I said, no, no, no, I've got this job at Southern University, I'm going to teach.  And I took off and went to Southern.  I turned them down, in other words, and I often wondered what it would have been like if back there in 1950 I had gone and taken up the job with Kemper Insurance Company.  I said I'm not sure that I would have made a great business executive, I don't know that, but in any case, they made the offer and I turned them down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went down to Southern and I started this teaching career and not only was I teaching English but I was always advising the student newspaper.  They knew that my journalism, my background in journalism, and so on.  And, you know, it's a very modest background but it was better than nothing.  And so I was the advisor to this--to the student newspaper, something I also dearly loved and had a wonderful time
Story_ID: 91379
Speaker 1: But I stayed there [Southern University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] just three years, met my wife [HM Lula Cole Dawson] there, and--
Speaker 2: Now, how did you meet her, now?  What's the story?
Speaker 1: That's a story.  She--she was the president of the YWCA and I was the advisor to the YMCA--the faculty advisor to the YMCA and we had occasions to be planning events where the two of us were there.  She likes to point out that we--when the same car traveling to a site to investigate whether we should have a retreat here or retreat there and we--and that's where we met and where we started talking to each other and where we got to know each other and one thing led to another and we became involved and the year after, the year I was leaving, she'd already graduated from Southern and gone off to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Now wait a minute here.  Now, she says something that's kind of interesting here (laughter).  (Unclear) she says that when she mentioned, you didn't tell her that you were a teacher.  She had to find out from somebody else (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's probably true (laughter).  That's probably quite true.  We were--in those days, teachers could not be seen going around with students, it just wasn't done, so she didn't know until well after we met that I was a teacher.  Others knew it.  They had seen me in class, of course, but she had not.  But anyway, that's how it all happened.  We got to know each other with this connection and she left--she was--graduated middle of the year, took a job there at Southern and then went off to graduate school and by the end of the next year, I had agreed to go to North Carolina College in Durham, take a job there, and we married in 1953, in August the 30th, which makes you--lets you know that come August the 30th, this year, we will have been married for fifty years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so we--off we went to North Carolina College together where I continued to teach English and, again, to advise the student newspaper.  And we stayed there for the first nine or ten years of our marriage and both our boys were born in Durham, North Carolina.
Story_ID: 91380
Speaker 1: Now she, she talked about an interesting character that was there that was--that she met in graduate school who--a man by the name of Moore, who--
Speaker 2: Yes, Douglas Moore.  He was a graduate of North Carolina Central [University in Durham, North Carolina] and he was a Methodist minister and he had come there--he'd been assigned to a church there in Durham and so she had run into him in Boston.  By this time we're back in Durham, he--by this time he was married and had moved back to Durham to take over this church and we both went over there and joined to be very helpful to him, to Doug Moore.  And Doug was a radical, actually.  He would have done much better in New York in those days of the communist than I would have--than I did.  Anyway, he was a radical.  He was always leading demonstrations and integrating his sentiments and so on and being hauled off to jail.  And he--I'm sure she must have told you that he started the sit-in idea right there in Durham at a place called Royal Ice Cream Company.  He took students from North Carolina College, they went there and sat down in Royal Ice Cream Company and the owners asked him to move, they refused, and the police arrested them.  And, of course, that's what Doug wanted.  And he immediately called the NAACP and said, you see they have used the instrumentality of the state to enforce the segregation in a private place.  And the NAACP at the time said, well look, that's true, we know you're right, and so on, but we're not ready yet to tackle that.  So that was probably around, oh I would say, 1955 or six [1956], maybe a little later.
Speaker 1: That's interesting because it's a--we recently heard a story from Dr. Ron Walters that they conducted a sit-in in Wichita in '58 [1958]--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --and it predates the '61' [1961]--it's the '61' [1961] or '60' [1960] or '61' [1961] date that everybody--I said it's the '60' [1960], right--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --that everybody thinks where the three students at North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical State University]--
Speaker 2: Yup.
Speaker 1: --you know, everybody thinks that's the beginning of the sit-in movement but they say that--
Speaker 2: No, no, it's just that the NAACP was not ready yet to tackle that particular issue and so although there were those who--who sat in it before, they, you know, they were in jail.  In Durham, I know this is true in Durham, the powers that be simply went down and bailed them out.  And so you--and that was the end of it.  The city didn't complain any more, the students probably went back to campus and planned their next move and so on.  But the time was not right to test the notion that was involved in that kind of strategy.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That's interesting that--his story on this, I've never heard all these versions of this before and I'd think it'd be interesting for anybody doing research on this to look at all these different stories about start-ups.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Start-ups and stops and all that, you know, 'cause everybody assumes just one act creates a movement but it's a lot of little things--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely and Douglas Elaine Moore was trying all of them.  I mean, he was sitting in at the bus station and sitting in at the private places, I think, this ice cream parlor and, in fact, he was such a radical in this regard and such a pain in the--in the side for the black establishment there which was actually working hand in glove with the white establishment trying to ease in some sort of version of integration.  He was such a pain in the side that the Bishop moved him from Durham and sent him abroad as a missionary.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was sent to--
Speaker 2: Congo.
Speaker 1: Africa.
Speaker 2: Congo, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was sent to Congo.
Story_ID: 91381
Speaker 1: Now, now it leads us to the question of, now you're teaching school and I hear that there's a story that involves Edward R. Murrow and how you got to his a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-hum.  I was--I was at North Carolina College [Durham, North Carolina] as it then was, as I said, teaching English and advising the student newspaper and we decided, my wife and I, that in order for--if I were going to stay in education, as a matter of fact, that's a term John Hope Franklin used to me one day, I was down in the basement of one of the buildings where he was and he said, how you doing, fella?  I had met him when I first got to North Carolina.  How are you doing?  And I said, great.  I was telling him all the things that I was doing with students and how I was enjoying working with the newspaper and all of that.  And he said, oh, that's fine, that's very nice, he said but if you are going to stay in this business, you've got to have a Ph.D.  This is John Hope Franklin.  And so, almost immediately, my attention turned to that as an objective.  My wife and I decided that that was really good advice and that I needed it--well we knew that I needed it anyways.  So anyways, off I went to the University of Iowa to--to get a doctorate.  And I undertook a study out there of the attitudes of foreign peoples--about people from abroad in the United States.  My question was, "What do they think of America?"  "What do they think of the United States?"  "What do they think we are?"  And, "Where do they--what's the source of these impressions?"  "How do they acquire the information about us, about the United States?"  And then finally, what happens after they've been in this country for a few years, say for one year, two years, three years, do they--what happens to their opinions.  So I did a study on this and it attracted some attention at the time because, as I said earlier, this was a period of the Cold War and everybody was concerned about perceptions of the United States and so on.  So we--this study came to the attention of Edward R. Murrow, who I believe was Kennedy's first appointment, President Kennedy made his first appointment and it was of Edward R. Murrow to direct the United States Information Agency.  And this study came to his attention and he invited me to join the USIA [United States Information Agency], in other words to become a diplomat in the U.S. Foreign Service.  He came to Durham on a recruitment trip and came to--in other words, to invite me personally, which is what he did.  And my wife and I decided that, why not try this.  We also had been affected by John F. Kennedy's call to "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."  When we really, I must say, might sound somewhat corny, but we had heard that and really were asking ourselves that very question and when Murrow came along and asked--and tried to interest us in diplomatic service, we immediately said yes, we would do it.
Story_ID: 91382
Speaker 1: Chew on this for a minute 'cause this is--this is some heady stuff.  Now, [President John F.] Kennedy administration, a new frontier--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --and we're coming off this--we're in this--amidst this Civil Rights struggle, but all of a sudden emerges this president who's young, who seemed to have new ideas about Civil Rights and admonishes the South, to some extent, about the behavior down there and then you get a personal visit from Edward R. Murrow, who's a top television figure--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the highest--one of the highest profile men in the Kennedy administration.  He comes to see you in Durham, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: I heard a plane--the mayor, everybody rushes over there to see what's going on (laughter), right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is a big deal, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was.  Keep in mind that's a part of it.  Murrow was sitting down there, my wife probably told you, we could meet only at the airport and--
Speaker 1: Because of segregation in Durham [North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yeah, because of segregation in Durham.  There was no integrated restaurant in Durham so we met at the airport and had food and drink, basically drink.  He--sitting there and he told us, he said, look, our country is receiving a black eye all over the world because of the segregation and it's not going to continue, John F. Kennedy is going to see that something is done about the segregation.  We're going to change it.  He says, it's under change now but under John F. Kennedy, this whole process of segregation is going to be turned around and we need people like you to tell the story of United States, let people know that there is progress in our country and that there will be more progress.  We need--that's the story that this Agency is going to--to get across and we need people like you to help get that question--get that across.  He made no bones about that.  He wanted--he recognized that discrimination and segregation were a part of a fabric of American life but he said that that's not the whole story, we want to get across a plainer view, a more balanced view, of our country and most of all we want to give--let people know that progress is being made.  And that's--those are the arguments that, quite frankly, persuaded us.  We decided to take a chance at doing that.  And he said, this is [Edward R.] Murrow, in heading USIA [United States Information Agency], he said we want to tell--show people our country, whites and all, that's what USIA is going to do under me and that was his theory that you wouldn't lie about the country, you would tell the truth because credibility here was at stake.  You would actually tell foreign audiences what the country was really like.
Speaker 1: Yeah, for those who were not familiar with Edward R. Murrow's television program in the--program on CBS, he was sittin' back smoking a cigarette and he talked to stars and other celebrities on some sort of a closed circuit hookup and what was the name of the show?
Speaker 2: "See It Now".
Speaker 1: "See It Now", right, and it was a let's find a truth out type of show, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Precursor of the "60 Minutes".
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, exactly, and Walter Cronkite, for example, was his protege and by extension I would say Dan Rather.  So, he was a pioneer, was Murrow in television, and in this type of journalism that you're referring to.  So we--we responded to that.  We really wanted to be of service in response to Kennedy's appeal and that, quite frankly, that's why we left.
Story_ID: 91383
Speaker 1: So you decided to go to--
Speaker 2: We decided to join USIA [United States Information Agency] and they were going to send us to the Congo.  We--our assignment, or I should say this, I should make this point, once we got down to sign on the dotted line, I told the visitor who came down, I said, look, yes, we'll go to--we'll join USIA but on one condition, we go abroad--but on one condition.  He said, what is that?  I said, we want to go to Africa, and he sort of smiled, a broad smile began to creep across his face because that's precisely what they had in mind (laughter).  So that was fine.  Our assignment--our first assignment was going to be the Congo and then war broke out in the Congo and--while I was in a French class, preparing to go to Congo, and instead I was assigned to Uganda.  And that was our first assignment, in October, 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we went to Uganda and I--we went on leave from North Carolina College [Durham, North Carolina], took leave for a year.  And then at the end of that year, we asked for--the work was interesting and we asked for another year.  And by the time--we were doing very exciting things.  I was giving lectures at the University, making speeches to clubs and organizations, showing films about this country.  We had a free-lending library.  I founded a newsletter called "Uganda Calling: Vote for the Uganda Students in this Country" and for the people who were trying to attract in Kampala in Uganda.  And it was very exciting work.  In fact, my work was--earned me a merit award--superior service award back in the Agency and my name began to spread around the various posts, especially those in Africa but also other parts, so much so that I was immediately asked to go from the smallest--one of the smallest post in Africa to take over cultural affairs in the very largest post in Africa, in Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Now before we get there, I just want to chew a little bit on Uganda.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Uganda was called at one time a "Jewel of Africa"--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Churchill, yes.
Speaker 1: --beautiful scenery.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's a great place.  Churchill called it "The Pearl of Africa," he called it, and it had a great educational institution.  It had a great college called Makerere University College.  It had great school systems, some of the most illiterate, intelligent people in all of Africa.  It was a part of the East Africa Federation, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, I mean, Tanganyika, as it then was.  And it had its independence in October, 1962.

Speaker 1: Now, what was Dr. Milton Obote like, the first president?  What was he--
Speaker 2: You know, I think, Obote--I always wondered if I have him right.  He was a very fine person, I thought.  He was a visionary.  He had a tough job trying to unite and pacify Uganda.  He was a Nilotic, a Northerner, and the largest tribe, we say now the largest ethnic group in Uganda was the Buganda.  They had a kingdom going back, they said centuries.  They had a huge kingdom.  There was a king and everything.  And Obote had to contend with the strength of, not only the Buganda kingdom but other kingdoms as well, and he was from a minority ethnic group himself.  So holding all that together he did very well for a time.  By the time he began to lose his grip, we had gone.  But let me just tell you our experience with him.  He was a type of person who would just drop off at our house any time he wanted to have a nice conversation, almost without bodyguards, he'd just come by and talk.  He talked about the importance of Uganda and its institutions in relationship to Kenya which was getting all the attention because of Jomo Kenyatta and Tom Mboya and those people, but mainly Jomo Kenyatta.  And in relation also to Tanganyika where Julius Nyerere was, and of course that was a great competition internationally for Milton Obote who was not known.  If the president of Uganda had been Mutesa, the King of the Buganda, then he would have been known much better throughout the rest of the world but Obote was a lesser known figure than these people that I just named.  And so he--but he was very conscious of Uganda's place.  Uganda had more riches than the rest, as has come to be proved, and people were very well governed.  Unhappily, the Buganda contested him and pushed him and things began to unravel fairly quickly around, I guess, '65' [1965] or so.  And he became more of a tyrant, if you follow that--the convention of wisdom, he became more of a tyrant.  If I knew anything, he was being looked upon by the rest of the world as a tyrant and, of course, he was ultimately overthrown by Idi Amin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who was then, when we were there, a soldier in the--down in the ranks, the military.
Story_ID: 91385
Speaker 1: Now is there any--scenario that I've heard is that the British, Israelis and the Americans looked for someone to succeed [Milton] Obote 'cause they thought he was too left and, actually picked Idi Amin for stardom and trained him--I know he trained in Israel and he had help of the--British help, supposedly, in taking over from Obote but then they had a monster on their hands, a guy they couldn't really--who was unreasonable, completely.
Speaker 2: I cannot personally corroborate that, frankly.  Idi Amin was not known when we were there and I mean I never heard the name Idi Amin when I was in Uganda.  We stayed there two plus years and Obote was looked upon as somewhat radical.  There's no question about that.  He wasn't all that much trusted by our own State Department and certainly his Foreign Minister--Minister for Foreign Affairs, was now a man named Sam Odaka.  See, this was the Cold War period and people were contesting to see whether you could gain favor from the right or the left.  Who would the Russians--who would be consorting with the Russians?  Who would be consorting with the Americans?  And Obote was trying to play, I think, a sort of a balanced game in his days as Prime Minister.  But there were often feelings on the part of many people that he was left because he had to come out of a labor movement, by the way, that was another issue Obote had come out of, the labor movement.  I do think, though quite frankly, that he was much more inclined towards the West than he was toward the Eastern Block, in his heart of hearts, I mean.
Speaker 1: Okay, I suppose anyone--well, the labor movement's about change for the poor people and I guess it's ironic that it's always conceived as being too radical.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  Well because they, you know, if you--the labor movement often foments strikes and that type of thing and they are associated with civil unrest and that's one of the issues that the communist were always identified with.  Obote never finished Makerere College.  He was put out because of his radicalism.  That's--that's fairly well documented, fairly well-known.  And--
Speaker 1: So, he wasn't Dr. Milton no more?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.  He never finished college.  He never finished there.  So--but he--and he was actually kind of a compromised president.  The rest of the ethnic groups would not tolerate a Muganda being president as one was when the--just after the independence, they had settled on a Muganda and the other ethnic groups said, no way, we just can't take that because they were already the largest group.  They were the best educated.  They had most of the wealth--much of the wealth and so on.  And so these other ethnic groups objected very strongly to a Muganda becoming Prime Minister and that's how Obote actually came to the fore.
Story_ID: 91386
Speaker 1: Now, now from, you say you were assigned to Nigeria next, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I was Cultural Affairs Officer in Uganda and then based on all these things I was doing over there in Uganda, I was asked to go to Nigeria and take over as Cultural Affairs Officer there, the largest post we had in Africa.  By the way, one of the things that I was asked to do when--I was charged with doing in going to Uganda was proving to the British that American education was worthwhile, that it had some value.  The British had told--well, they said throughout Africa but certainly in Uganda, American education is worthless, it's not--not of any value to you so don't waste your time.  And none of the students, very few of the students in Uganda, were being allowed to come to the United States for an education and that was my mission to change that perception in Uganda and that's what I spent a lot of my time trying to do and I had some success.  And on that kind of success, based with all these other things I was doing, I was sent to Nigeria as Cultural Affairs Officer and, of course, Nigeria's British Africa with some of the same problems, some of the same issues to deal with.  The difference was that Nigerians had been coming to the United States for the longest, they've been coming since the, probably the 1900s, and so they, many of them, had been trained here, including as we said earlier on, Nnamdi Azikiwe and Kwame Nkrumah.  So, I didn't have that problem to wrestle with so much as other issues on education and culture.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you mentioned Nnamdi Azikiwe, now he was the President of Nigeria, I mean (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  He--well keep in mind now, when you say president, he had another one of these problems.  Now Azikiwe, who led Nigeria very much towards independence, he had been the freedom fighter, if you will, even back in the United States in the '30s [1930s], had challenged the institution of colonialism, gone back home and did a great deal to--with his newspaper, he was a journalist, to lead the country to independence but here, the same problem that you see now surfaced then.  The North, which is basically Islamic, did not want to have a Southerner who was a Christian in charge of the country and there was this big battle amongst the--it's not the only issue, but that's one of the issues, this big battle between the North and the South in order to get independence and the British, of course, made settling these issues one of the condition of independence.  And so they settled on a Northerner as Prime Minister, which is where the power was, Sir--to follow Balewa and Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, a Northerner, became Prime Minister, a very, very fine person and Zik took the job of president, which was really largely a ceremonial job.
Speaker 1: Now Balewa, that sounds like--was he an Islamicized Yoruba.  Is that what it was?
Speaker 2: I'm not--I don't think so.  I think he--
Speaker 1: He was from the Northern--
Speaker 2: He's from the North, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, that was his name.
Speaker 1: Balewa sounds so Europe--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --I didn't know.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, he was the first Prime Minister and he was killed in the first coup, as was the Foreign Minister and a few other people.
Story_ID: 91387
Speaker 1: Now, Azikiwe, who was known as Zik, seemed to be a fairly popular person in Nigeria, even though he was overthrown, but, what was your impression of him?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was very popular but you see this popularity we're talking about was basically among his own ethnic group, among the Igbo population and to some extent among the Yoruba but he did not have that same popularity in the North among the Hausas and the Fulani's and so on and so on.  There were some Igbo's in the North and he had popularity among them.  He--if he had become Prime Minister and if he could have pulled all of these forces, these ethnic groups together, I think he may well have done, Nigerian history, of course, would be far different.  It's had a series of coups and countercoups since the '60s [1960s] and this--they're almost always based on these ethnic problems and also, of course, the problem with wealth, the oil, the mineral resources that generated in that country.  The problem is, you see, the minerals are in the South and the Midwest, we used to call it, and in the East and these are among the Southern Christian groups.  The numbers, the population numbers of people in the North and, of course, over time the armies have had to be balanced--well they haven't been balanced, but large numbers of the people in the military, from the North, the officers--some officers from the South but also officers from the North and you see--every time there's a coup, you see all of these fragments at the bottom of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we spent three years there, had a great term of service there and Nigeria was a most enjoyable assignment.  We were there in the days when Nigeria was beginning to feel the joy of independence, we thought, and asserting itself as the largest country in Africa, the richest country in Africa, the best educated country, all of these superlatives, and it continues to enjoy that, it's just not the most peaceful and the most stable, that's a problem.
Speaker 1: And it's interesting that it doesn't seem--it seems as though in Nigeria, where they have a coup, or they have a problem, they never seem to spill over onto the foreign population, I mean, the diplomatic corps--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: It seems it's always just internally.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they're fighting each other, they're not fighting the foreigners and also the diplomatic corps, you know, enjoyed and everybody recognizes this for the most part, enjoys certain immunity.  They don't want to go out and kill the British ambassador because, you know, they don't want the British fighting them or opposed to them or so on or even the Americans or anybody else.  Their fight is internal.  It's definitely not a fight of outsiders.
Story_ID: 91388
Speaker 1: Well from Nigeria where did you go next?
Speaker 2: We went to Liberia and I had served as a Cultural Affairs Officer in both Uganda and Nigeria and then I was assigned to Liberia as head of the USIA [United States Information Agency] operation.  I was what is known as a Public Affairs Officer and we stayed there for three years, three plus years, and that was a fine assignment also.  We had known more about Liberia because of the tie between the United States and that country than we had known about either Uganda or Nigeria, which is the earlier places--which are the earliest places where we had served.  And we had a good tour there but it was--Liberia was very, very close to the United States so you didn't have the challenges there that you had in the other two places.
Speaker 1: It was actually founded by a group in the U.S. called "American Colonization Society" back in the 1840s, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you had--sure, you had--this was a country where freed--I mean America--people who had been slaves or the descendants of American slaves, talked about going back to Africa and there were those who wanted to--want them to go back to Africa at the solution to the American race problem and that was the theory of the American Colonization Society, that's why they were established, to return blacks safely and productively to Africa, and Liberia was chosen as that place to do it.  And a large number of people did go back when that was a part, largely a part, of Marcus Garvey's--Marcus Garvey's movement to return Americans to Africa.
Speaker 1: And he chose Liberia as a target--
Speaker 2: And he chose Liberia, yes.
Speaker 1: --that was a bad choice for him because they didn't let them settle there.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: They basically, though--many Liberians joined the UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association], they didn't let the Americans from here settle over there.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now Liberia is marked by the tension between the Americo-Liberians and the rest of the native population--
Speaker 2: It really was, yes.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (unclear).  Yeah, but can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just a bit.  It was--I do think that that tension was greatly exaggerated under [William] Tubman and perhaps also under [William] Tolbert.  President Tubman had done a great deal to quiet the--to lessen the tension between these ethnic groups.  He was encouraging more and more togetherness on the parts of these two large groups and amongst the tribes as well.  He was truly regarded as the kind of father figure for the entire country.  He had been president--he was president for a very long time and Tolbert, William Tolbert, was his vice president and succeeded Tubman as president and he did not have the skills and techniques and generosity that Tubman had and therefore things degenerated but, yes, it's a fact.  There were tensions, ethnic tensions, amongst Americo-Liberians and the native Liberians.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 91389
Speaker 1: We're talking about Liberia here and we did spend about three years there, very profitable term of service.  One of the things that we tried--one tries to do in the old USIA [United States Information Agency] was to get publicity for the United States in favor of publicity all over the place and we were able to do that in places such as Uganda and Nigeria but the challenge in Liberia was to keep them from saying--to tone down the publicity because there was such an affinity in Liberia for the United States.  America was a model.  So anyway, we had a good experience there.  I was brought back from Liberia in 1970 and--to attend what is known as the Senior Seminar in Foreign Policy, that's a kind of a finishing school for a diplomat who is going on to higher things in the Foreign Service.  And so I devoted a year to that.  It's a period of reflection, reading and traveling and thinking big thoughts and writing papers on your experiences.  So that is what I did for one year.  Then I did--I had a worldwide assignment in Cultural Affairs for another year and then they asked me to become director of all of our African programs.  And I stayed in that job, back here in the United States, but I traveled to Africa.  And so in that capacity, I traveled and visited every African country during the period of three or four years while I was Director of African Affairs.
Speaker 2: What are these years, roughly there?
Speaker 1: They were, let's see, I would say '73 [1973], four [1974], five [1975], six [1976].  I was assistant, I mean, I was deputy to the assistant for one of those years and then I took over and was, myself director for two to three years.  We stayed in the country longer than we should have stayed, that's because I was given this job to have the responsibility for all of Africa in the United States Information Agency [USIA].  So, we did that and at the end of that period, which was a very, very profitable one, as I said, I was traveling every other month or so to various places in Africa, two or three countries at a time, and I visited practically all of the countries and went to--went to them more than once.  You had to supervise our personnel in those--throughout Africa.
Story_ID: 91390
Speaker 1: So then I was assigned to become the Minister of Information and Culture for our government in the Philippines.  And we went to the Philippines in '76 [1976]--'76 [1976], yes, and had a tour there as one of the high ranking officers in this embassy which had the largest contingent of American personnel of any embassy in the world.
Speaker 2: What--why was that, do you know?
Speaker 1: Well because of the long-time affinity between United States and the Philippines and because of the installations we had in the Philippines.  We had bases there.  We had an air base, army base and a naval base in the Philippines.  We had a Voice of America installation, a--what do you call it, a relay station--a relay station in the Philippines.
Speaker 2: It's the radio Voice of--
Speaker 1: Voice of America, yes.  And we had an American cemetery there because, you know, the Filipinos fought with the U.S. in World War II and many Americans are buried right there in the Philippines.  So we had a monuments commission in the Philippines, Veterans Administration, IRS, the whole works, hospital, all of these things, installations in the Philippines.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Philippines has been sort of an American--
Speaker 1: It was thought of as an American colony.
Speaker 2: --(Unclear).
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --Spanish American War.
Speaker 1: That's right, exactly, that's when it came under that rubric.  So we stayed there for three years.  I was doing education and cultural relations to the intellectuals to the country, to the universities, to the government, especially in education and culture, all those kinds of things that I was doing early on in my career, which reached a climax here in that latest assignment in the Philippines.  And then it was--I was there when President Carter invited me--appointed me Ambassador to Botswana.
Speaker 2: Now, before we get to Botswana, I just want to ask you about--now when you were in the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos was president.
Speaker 1: Was president, yes.  Ferdinand Marcos was president and--
Speaker 2: What's your impression of him and his fate, he and Imelda, I mean?  What do you think about what he was doing?  Do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 1: Yes, I once--I have mixed emotions there.  There's no question that he was in--he was a very strong leader, probably a dictatorial leader.  He didn't allow a great deal of opposition, and Imelda was very well thought of among the population and so on but they, again, like so many dictator-type leaders, simply stayed on too long.  They got involved in this issue with Aquino.  Aquino was a popular--a popular figure rising up to challenge Marcos and there was no provision in this situation for Marcos to be challenged and, therefore, it led to his overthrow.  I mean, the U.S. had backed Marcos all these years.  Marcos had been our ally with the Filipinos, whom he led, in World War II.  He was a hero, so we've said.  There was some question about that in his dying days because there were all kind of research done to show that Marcos was not the heroic figure that tradition had assigned to him.  But, anyway, the lack of democratic tendencies, in fact, the growing arrogance of Marcos and especially--and Imelda, and the government, the corruption, these are the things that led to his overthrow.  Yes.
Story_ID: 91391
Speaker 1: Okay, and so at that time, when you're in that assignment, was about the time the president, Jimmy Carter, appointed you ambassador to--
Speaker 2: Botswana.
Speaker 1: --Botswana.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Now we left--when we left the Philippines, Marcos was still in power.  In fact, my wife had become quite a celebrity out there by founding this organization called, "The Friends of the--what is it--the Cultural Center of the Philippines" which she modeled on the Kennedy Center operation here.
Speaker 1: Now there's a--let me ask you about this.  There's a historical relationship in this country between blacks and Filipinos in the same neighborhoods, you know, it seems like a lot of black communities are--Filipinos lived and associated with members of the community on some level--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --and so, my grandmother told stories of living with Filipinos during the [Great] Depression.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: That sort of thing.  I don't, you know, is there any--
Speaker 2: I don't know much about that.  I do know that all Filipinos, well, practically every Filipino you meet wants to come to the United States, that's their ambition.  They want to come to the United States.  In fact, they wanted to make the--many Filipinos wanted to vote that country in as the 51st state.  This always comes up.  So, and I have never been in a position to live in a neighborhood where Filipinos were so I cannot testify to that, but I do know that they think very highly of this country and want--look at it--look to it as a kind of mecca.
Speaker 1: Well, what about the black American population?  Do they see the black American population as the whites see us or does that--especially during that time and--or do you think that there's a different kind of relationship?
Speaker 2: I think there's a different relationship.  I think that because of colonialism, because of this long history of the American presence in the Philippines, and because of the bases and all of that, the--certainly the Filipinos are more closely affiliated with the whites than they are with blacks.  In fact, we were encouraged not to go to the Philippines when we were assigned there because they said that Filipinos don't like blacks.  We heard that and we didn't believe it and we went anyway and we're very glad that we did because we found that we got along beautifully in the Philippines, and especially my wife who was highly thought of, all of the things she was doing, particularly among women there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 91392
Speaker 1: Well let's move on to Botswana then.  Well, how did you find Botswana?  It's a smaller country, adjacent to South Africa.  What's the story there?  What's Botswana--
Speaker 2: See, Botswana was never a colony.  It was sort of a territory that the British thought of it.  They never took it under their wing because they thought it was too poor to deal with and so it was sort of a stepchild.  And the story goes that before, and prior to independence, the British had continued to think of Botswana as very, very poor.  However, diamonds--it had been known by the Botswana's, especially the president, that diamonds did exist there.  And so the British sort of let the country go without recognizing the mineral wealth under the soil.  And so it was given its freedom, granted its freedom, and as soon as it was free, they revealed, this is what the story--tradition has it, they revealed that diamonds were indeed a part--under the soil in Botswana, in fact, very near the top of the soil, the best place for diamonds and exploration.  So, Botswana became--Britain gave Botswana freedom about the same time it did for Lesotho and Swaziland but, of course, Botswana is the richest of these countries and, in fact, its wealth is on the par with that of South Africa.  And, you know, in relative terms, it's one of the richest countries in Africa and has one of the smallest populations.  So it's in a good shape, and good financial shape, has a splendid political tradition.  It has changed governments three times, peacefully, without any problem whatsoever.  It--the thing here is that we had a very modest people who, and peace loving, and who are really very conservative in their outlook.  They're not fighting each other.  They're not trying to acquire great wealth.  There's very little, if any, story of corruption in the country.  People are trying to maximize their resources so as to make for progress.  In fact, they go out and import technicians and technology that they need using the resources that they have for that.  And it's a very progressive country, Botswana.  We--we enjoyed our stay there.  It was my first and only tour as ambassador.  I represented the country--this country at a time when the big issue was, first of all, freedom in Zimbabwe, Rhodesia, as it was then known.  And so I had to--we, as an embassy, sort of served as a conduit for all of the diplomats and all of the technology and so on, flowing from here to this country into Zimbabwe, at a time when Robert Mugabe was looked upon as a very progressive leader.  And so we had some input there.
Story_ID: 91393
Speaker 1: And then after that, we had a great deal of input in the freedom struggle in South Africa.  This was a time when the uprisings were really in full flower in this country, in the United States, and amongst students throughout the country.  And the--unhappily with the time of the [President Richard] Nixon administration and, oh, actually the [President Ronald] Reagan administration, which was not--which was really opposed to bringing pressure on South Africa to end apartheid.  And the chief American diplomatic officer for this government to that part of the world was a man named Chester Crocker who advocated with the administration, something called, "constructive engagement".  That is to say, don't push South Africa too hard, reason with them, try to make concessions here and there and ultimately they will free Africans and bring in--free Africans in a stable society.  Well, as you know, that wasn't happening and so the uprisings here led to the--and here and in Britain and other parts of the world, but especially here, and in Britain, and the boycotts, I mean, the--yes, the boycotts by American business and by--which the student uprisings forced, disinvestments, that type of thing brought about, largely account for the bringing about of independence for blacks in South Africa.  And we were down there through--during all of that period of time and working in what I was working in and what was known as the "contact group".  That is to say the countries which were supporting the boycotts of South Africa and pushing for independence in South Africa for all the black Africans.  That is to say, Canada, France, Germany, Nigeria, they had brought Nigeria into this, Britain and the United States.  Those were the contact group members in Liberia and we had to make representations to the government of Botswana to keep them aware of what was going on and why there should be--they should assist us in bringing pressure on South Africa.  And it worked.  We--I was the chief spokesman for the ambassadorial group because I had--I was closest to the president of Botswana.  We had become very, very close friends, President [Quett] Masire, was president then.  We'd become very close friends and so my colleagues sort of elected me as the chief spokesman for the contact group.  They didn't buy constructive engagement, I can tell you that but they did react to the pressure being brought by the students and others in this country and very much opposed the apartheid in South Africa.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, how long were you in Botswana?  You were there from--
Speaker 1: About three plus years.
Speaker 2: It was mid '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 1: No, I was there from '79 [1979] to '83 [1983].
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine [1979] to '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Story_ID: 91394
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so what happened next when you left Botswana?
Speaker 2: Well I--when I came back here and I served for a brief time, a year, probably in what is known as the recruitment division of our Agency--I mean of State Department.  So I stayed in the State Department for a year or so and then I went back--you see, once you're an ambassador, you have to be in the State Department.  So I came back, I was in the State Department.  Then ultimately, back to USIA [United States Information Agency] where I became the--in the recruitment division and then I became head of the EEO [Equal Employment Opportunity] office in USIA and after a short time in that, until 1979, I'm sorry 1989, I came back in '83' [1983], and by 1989 I retired and the very next day I went to Howard [University] and became--and started back in education.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you've been at Howard ever since?
Speaker 2: Ever since then, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what's your principle, you know, what do you teach--I know you're a founder of--
Speaker 2: No, I came up there to direct a program in communications.  All of our School of Communications, the kids wanted to be announcers and anchorpeople and that sort of thing and they brought me in to help them with their expression, their English and so on, in other words to work in the area of communication.  And I did that for a while and next they asked me at Howard, almost before the year was up, to take over a program in public affairs, in honor of Patricia Roberts Harris, who was the first black woman to become United States Ambassador.  So I took over that program and pushed that and then I founded the Ralph--the International Affairs Program at Howard while working in the public affairs, I wrote a proposal to have an international affairs program at Howard.  I put a proposal to one of the foundations, to the Kellogg Foundation, and Kellogg gave us three million dollars to do this, to establish a program in international affairs and I did so and I became the first director of that.  And for the most part, I've stayed in that.  I was out one year doing public relations for the university, that was the year between presidents when--and acting president [HM] Joyce Ladner, Dr. Joyce Ladner, took over as acting president of Howard.  She asked me to direct public relations for her and I did so.  And after that, when that ended, and President [H. Patrick] Swygert [HM] became president, I soon returned to the international affairs area by which time the international affairs program had been named for Ralph Bunche, and so now my title is Director of the Ralph Bunche International Affairs Center.  That program that started has now evolved into a center.  So we have a center of international affairs and I'm the director of that.
Story_ID: 91395
Speaker 1: Just reflecting back onto your Ph.D. dissertation that Edward R. Murrow read about, the--when he read about the study that you conducted in Iowa, about the impression that foreigners have of the United States, what do you think people, and I guess it's hard to do this as a blanket way, but what do you think people in other countries are thinking of African Americans these days with the high profiles of [HM] Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice?
Speaker 2: Well, okay, in those days when I did my study, back in the '60's [1960s], the whole issue of African American in this country was under close, very close scrutiny, and the feelings generally was that African Americans were certainly suppressed, had no rights, they were comparable to the situation in South Africa and so that was a very unrealistic view of the situation.  Sure, things were bad and I must say, worst than they--much worse than they should have been but in my study I discovered that this was the perception, sort of worldwide.  Over time, of course, this has changed considerably and the Civil Rights Movement after all came into being after that time that I did that study.  And the cities had been burned and [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] had his leadership put to the test many times and led a goodly, a goodly amount of progress in this country for African Americans.  Now, you say, what do people think about it now?  I suspect, given the high profiles that African Americans have through such people, as [HM] Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice and not to mention the athletes, think of the [Venus and Serena] Williams' sisters and Tiger Woods and so on and all of these big named--that almost anyone can refer to and I suspect the feeling is that African Americans are fairly well off in this country.  I would suspect that to be the case.  Again, this is an opinion, a generalized assumption but it's--I think it probably has basis, in fact.  I would say that.  I mean, I have not spent much time abroad in the past few years but based on what I can see, and what one sees when people come here, this is what you would think.
Speaker 1: Is there--I know there was a time where some foreign nationals did not see the United States political for foreign policy as being--or did not see African Americans as being responsible for, or even agreeing with, U.S. foreign policies, not necessarily, and you remember the stories in Vietnam where the Vietnamese were yelling hey, black G.I., run, you know, because I'm not even after you, you know.  I mean, do you think that perception has changed?
Speaker 2: I think that's certainly the case now as well, yes.  I think that's true.  And I think the polls show that.  I mean, I think that the Iraqi War, for example, African Americans opposed that.  If all the polls are correct, there's no question African Americans did not want any war in Iraq.  They were definitely opposed to that in large, large--in preponderant numbers.  That's quite true and but how that plays over--abroad, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the question whether the high profile of Colin Powell or Condoleezza Rice makes foreign national--maybe black Americans are in step with [President] George [W.] Bush on these issues.
Speaker 2: No, no I don't think they have that at all.  No, I think that it's well known abroad that African Americans are, for the most part, members of the Democratic party.  They have a much different view of things than a George [W.] Bush.  Indeed our legislators make that quite clear.  People like our Congressman [Charles] Rangel and former Congressman [Ron] Dellums and the rest, they make that very clear.  You'd be surprised the extent to which people abroad are acquainted with American issues through the press and CNN, for example, "Time Magazine" and all of the rest, those are the things that I was studying as far back as the '60s [1960s].  I didn't have CNN but we certainly had the magazines and the, and the films, books.

Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now did you ever feel pressurized by the USIA [Unites States Information Agency] to say things and put forth positions that you really didn't agree with at all?
Speaker 2: I did not.  I never felt that I had that kind of pressure on me.  The--Edward R. Murrow, when he talked to us the very initial time, he said, we want you to tell the truth about the U.S., warts and all, and we followed that from the--all throughout my career in the Information Agency.  I've written about it, as a matter of fact, and I'll probably--when I send you these forms, I'll send you my article on that subject that appeared in a book called, "Exploring America Through Cultural Exchange".  I'll send you a copy of that chapter that I had in the book on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know there was some backlash in the '80's [1980s] during the [President Ronald] Reagan administration for telling like it is type--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --approach and even shut down public radio, basically--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and said, you know--
Speaker 2: No, no, I was--I spent about a year and a half as ambassador to Botswana under [President Ronald] Reagan and I didn't feel that pressure even then, maybe because of where I was, you know, the policies there were--mainly had to do with South Africa and we were always on the side of the angels there.  The government wasn't, the U.S. government wasn't but we--I must say to their credit, many of the white diplomats as well felt that we were just doing the wrong--we were moving too slowly and had the wrong policies in places like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, you often hear people on the Internet or on television or in the streets, you know, talk about the U.S. government as a monolithic thing and it seems to me from what you're saying, it's a lot more complicated than that.
Speaker 2: Much more complicated, yes, yes.  In foreign service--in international service, of course, there are issues here that have to be worked through.  I mean, you work for the U.S. government and you don't go out there opposing U.S. government policies, no question about that but within that--there are ways of handling the distribution of facts without distortion which I think is a creditable way of handling things that are possible and that I, in fact, observed throughout my stay in diplomatic service.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 91397
Speaker 1: Sir, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes and concerns are that we will continue to find a niche in this multi-cultural society, that we are still not regarded fully as we should be in various aspects of life in such things as international service, for example.  I would hope that the day will come when African Americans would be--they would be recruited like anyone else and brought into Service like anyone else and treated as anyone else in the Service.  The concern that I'm saying, I'm reflecting here, must be that that is not the case today and so that's a concern.  I'm concerned about the plight of the African American male.  We have a real problem there with loss of so many young men from educational institutions, from society generally, into the criminal justice system.  I'm concerned about the AIDS problem which is related, of course, to the drug problem.  So these are issues that concern me a great deal because they stand in the way of the kind of progress that needs to be made in order for us to function productively in this society, as others do.

Speaker 1: Okay, and sir, what would you consider at this point as your legacy and how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I started out, as I said to you, as an educator and I'd like to be remembered for that as a person who--who believed in and had some impact through education on the lives of young people and I think that is the case.  I think that having started out in education, and now ending my career in education, I've had an opportunity to make some impact and I believe I have.  And what do I mean by impact?  I mean, encouraging our young people to venture out to achieve and to acquire knowledge and information in which they can use to their advantage in advancing useful careers.  In international service, I really have a hope that the things that I have been advocating and that have been working hard to do, and that is to bring more and more African Americans into the system will bear fruit.  I'm doing that right now in my position at Howard University where we are encouraging more and more young people to consider diplomatic service for their--as a career.  We have a special program now called, "The Charles B. Rangel Program".  We have a million dollars a year to do things to promote the service and its attractions among young college students, not merely at Howard but also from other parts of the country and specifically at other HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities].  We are trying to encourage them to become interested in international affairs, to take the qualifying examination, and qualify, and then to achieve, to move into the Service and advance in the Service and become diplomats.  They can go from the lowest grade in the Service, on merit, through to the highest grade to become ambassadors and directors and to achieve their highest potential in a service that is really rewarding.  I must say, the Diplomatic Service has been rewarding for me and I'd like to be remembered as one who not only was a good practitioner of it, especially in my years in Botswana where I was a--served as U.S. Ambassador, not only that but as one who encouraged others to go and do likewise.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you, sir.  Thank you so very much.
Speaker 2: And thank you very much, indeed.
