Speaker 1: I want to go back to your childhood, and I'd like to really talk, ask you about your parents.  I'd like to start with your father and if you could give his name and talk about his background and what you know about his growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, my father is Floyd L. Griffin, Sr.  And he was born in Wilkinson county [Georgia], which is one county south of, of Baldwin county and Milledgeville [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Can you spell Wikin-, Wikin-?
Speaker 2: Wilkinson, W-I-L-K-I-N-S-O-N, yes.  My father was born there, and at an early age--and I think around five or six--they moved to, to Milledgeville.  And his mother and father were separated--now I don't know, you know, at what point in time.  But I do remember both of them.  His father lived to be a hundred years old, and he was a minister.  And he died when I was maybe five or six years old, something like that.  And his mother lived to be--I'm not sure how old she was, but she was in her nineties and, and she lived--I guess I was thirteen or fourteen when she passed.  But I do remember both of them.  And my father's been living here in Milledgeville since he served in the military, and, and he's primarily been a private business owner almost all of my life, at least the part that I can remember.  My mother is Ruth Evans Griffin, R-U-T-H, E-V-A-N-S.  My mother was born here in Milledgeville, Baldwin county.  And she was a beautician for a number of years before she start working full time after my father purchased, my father and mother purchased, a funeral home.  And she worked there full time until she retired several years ago.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your mother's maiden name?
Speaker 2: Evans, E-V-A-N-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, either--let's start with your father.  Did he talk anything about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  There's some, especially, you know, the, the early years and the teenage years and, and how he had to, you know, work pretty hard to make ends meet.  My father has always been a very positive thinking person, energetic, and, and independent to some degree.  He talked about when he was in high school and where he used to work in different, you know, people's yards and clean the yards and cut grass and, and do those kinds of things and, and do some work in the homes.  He was making more money as a teenager in high school than some adults working, you know, full time because he always kept something going.  And he also participated in, you know, activities in the school--he played basketball--but he always found time to, to, to take care, help take care economically the family.
Speaker 1: And your mother, did she talk about her growing up at all?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother didn't talk a lot, has not talked a lot about her growing up, but it was pretty typical of the times.  She was, my mother was the oldest child, I think, and still is.  And my mother was kind of the favorite child of the family, and she was treated with a lot of tender loving care and those kind of things and she was spoiled, and she's still spoiled to some degree (laughter).  And my father's helped spoil her over the years.  But she basically, she went through high school and finished high school and, you know, did just a lot of work around the home as, as growing up.  But she didn't work out, you know, go and help clean up people houses and those kind of things.
Story_ID: 7922
Speaker 1: Your siblings--can you give their name and, and the order and where you fit in that birth order?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, I'm the oldest.  I have brother, Toney, T-O-N-E-Y, Toney Willis Griffin.  And he lives in, in the Atlanta [Georgia] area, and he's lived there since going off to college.  He worked for Delta Airlines for a number of years and recently retired.  And he's into real estate now and something that he did off and on over the years.  My sister, Delbra, D-E-L-B-R-A, Waller, W-A-L-L-E-R--Delbra is a graduate of Paine College here in [Augusta] Georgia--it's a Methodist school.  And she's has a son who's a, an adult son.  And she has been back in Milledgeville for a number of years, and she's also in the funeral business with us.  She's the assistant secretary and, and she's a funeral director.  And I forgot to mention that my brother has a son and a daughter, both adults.  And, we get along well.  We don't see each other as often as we should, especially my brother, but we talk periodically telephonically and--and I see my sister more often because we are in the business together.
Story_ID: 7923
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest memory, sir?
Speaker 2: Do I have a earliest memory?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I guess I do have several things I can remember.  I can remember very vividly when the Korean War was going on now. I remember that the Korean War was going on.  I probably didn't understand a lot about it, but that's when I decided that I wanted to go in the Army.  At that time I was very impressed by that--I, and, and I saw some of the young black men coming home in their uniforms and they were looking all sharp and, and s-, very professional-like.  So at that time that's when I decided I wanted to go in the Army.  So that period had a significant impact on my life.  I also remember my parents building a store next to our, our, to our home.  And I remember the bricklayers out there.  And at that time that's when I decided that I wanted to be a, really at that time I decided I wanted to be a bricklayer.  But later on based on that I decided I wanted to be an engineer or construction engineer.  And, and that's one reason I decided to go on off to Tuskegee Institute [later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and, and, and major in building construction and also become an officer in the army.  So all of that had a very important impact.  I also remember an incident that happened with a young white person about my age at that time.  I was probably in, in elementary school or middle school they would call it now.  And my parents ran this store.  And in the area we lived in, in the general area we lived in, whites lived in the, in the same general area, maybe a block over.  So it was not a total segregated living environment, but you, you know, kind of knew your place.  And I remember this guy coming up to s-, to store one day and ordering a soda or something like that and, and something happened and he said something to me that I didn't like.  And I guess he felt that just because he was white, you know, he could get away with that.  And he was in, in our store buying from us, and he's going to pull this, you know, this white power thing on me.  And, and, and I think he threw the soda or something on me and start running out of the store.  And I chased him.  And as he was jumping across this ditch, I jumped and kind of laid, laid it on him a little bit.  And so he went back and told his father and all that.  So his father came over and my, my father, who also just didn't play with that, you know, play those kind of games, and he sort of really kind of laid it on his dad, not from a physical standpoint, but told him that, you know, he didn't want his son coming up to our store anymore.  He couldn't come around bullying us because they were black and white, and we just didn't play that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: So you are--this is what time, sir?  About what is the year when this happened?
Speaker 2: It had to be in, probably the early '50s [1950s], yeah, '50 [1950], '51 [1951], '52 [1952], something like that.
Story_ID: 7924
Speaker 1: And what was the community like, yeah, at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, Milledgeville in Baldwin County probably was as typical as most communities of its size and in, in Georgia and esple-, and especially middle Georgia.  It was a segregated environment.  We all pretty well knew our place in society, you know, at the different ages obviously you started getting a better understanding of the segregated south.  But in Milledgeville there were different communities where blacks lived and whites lived, but at the same time it was not just one major large community that only blacks lived in there and then another one was just only whites.  There were some like that, obviously, where whites lived.  But there were a number of communities where blacks and whites almost lived next door.  Now it maybe was one block over and they were kind of spread out and et cetera.  Whites treated blacks like they were second-class citizens.  Downtown Milledgeville--there were places, for instance, cafés--I can remember one café, I think it was called Macoa's (ph.) café.  One side you could go in and the white was on one side and blacks was on the other side.  And it was just only divided by a, a counter where the servants, they're, they're, the servants, you know, were in the middle of, so they could work, wait on either side.  And you were getting the same food.  You go in and, and order the same thing but you couldn't go over on the white side.  There were drug stores here at that time, you know, where they had the counters where you could, the, the soda fountain counters and et cetera.  In some instances you could go in and order, but you couldn't sit there and, and enjoy the refreshments.  A number of the stores like furniture stores and et cetera you could go in and, and purchase things, but it, that just depended on how they felt about it.  You know, your dollar at that time was sometime different than somebody else dollars.  It's not like today, you know.  A dollar is a dollar.  And people don't run you out of the stores because of your color.  They may not want you around, but they accept that. The schools were segregated.  We got the hand-me-downs--your books and et cetera--and I think it was in 1957 when there was a massive improvement in the, the facilities where we got a number of new schools here in Milledgeville.
Speaker 1: Do you know what caused that?
Speaker 2: I really don't.  I, I think I really don't.  I don't know totally, but I think it had something to do with this, the, we needed more space.  And there were one or two individuals, I understand, white individuals that were procre-, progressive-minded and, and knew that we needed to improve at least the facility structures here in the, in the county.  And, and that made a significant difference in at least the environment and the learning environment.  And I can remember going to the new high school in the seventh grade, Boddie High School, which now is--doesn't exist anymore.  The facility is there, but it doesn't exist anymore.  And we got those hand-me-downs and it's really amazing when I go back and look at my class and my year group in the period of time when I was going through school and the emphasis that our teachers played on education and look at the success stories of people that left this little town and went off, and we have doctors and lawyers and, and retired military people and politicians --people gone and really made a success out of their life.  And you sometime ask--how?  How were we able to do that? You know, to go out and compete with the, the best and brightest from the white community who had all of those things to offer--you know, I go back and think about my military career, and, you know, starting out in 1962 and, and, and retiring in 1990 and was able to achieve what I was able to do in dealing with people who had gone to the military academies and got all of the, some of the, the major assignments and some great and significant education, at least from the standpoint of the systems put in that in there.  But we take our historical black colleges like Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Fort Valley [State College, Fort Valley, Georgia] and a number of the other schools around the country, and we were able to, those universities and colleges were able to put out some very capable men and women, black men and women, to go out and compete in the world.  You know, it's, it's just amazing.  It is--it's just mind boggling to, to be able to, to sit back sometime and reflect on how far we have come and under the situations that we were, we were under.
Story_ID: 7925
Speaker 1: Now let's go back to your childhood and I'm just wondering if you can share some anecdotes of growing up, you know, what family life was like, that type of thing--you're the oldest--?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I'm just wondering, you know, if you can sort of take yourself back and--.
Speaker 2: Well, my, my father [Floyd L. Griffin, Sr.] and mother [Ruth Evans Griffin] was very interested in us getting a good education.  Life was, was Sunday schools, church on Sunday, eating Sunday meals together, if possible, because during the week we were running in a million different ways.  And since my father was in business at that time--he was into what we call the wood business.  He sold wood to people, s-, firewood to people around in several counties.  So he was on the go all the time, and we were out helping him.  We had to work.  My, my brother [Toney Willis Griffin] and I we worked in the, the wood business, and my sister [Delbra Griffin] pretty much helped around the house and in the store.  My father was strict, just like a lot of family parents at that time.  There was a sense of community.  You couldn't go out and when your parents were gone doing different things and you were at home--the community, the next-door neighbors and et cetera looked out for you.  And if you did something that was out of the ordinary, you just, you'd be prepared, because they were gonna, you know, let your parents know what was going on and--.  And--but it was, all of that was out of love.  All of that was out of a desire to, to make sure that we had an opportunity to succeed and that, and, and to, you know, do the right thing in life.  And there were, there were a lot of role models then, you know.  And they were not all professional people.  They was just everyday people who was out struggling like everybody else to make, make things happen.  But, you know, nobody or very few people, probably even if they felt like they were lower class, it was not perceived that way because everybody was there to, to help each other.  As I was growing up, I really never had any real needs that were not met.  If it was something that, you know, we really needed to have--clothing--I never went without shoes or clothes on my back.  I don't, I, I don't know what hunger is all about because my parents, you know, provided for us.  And very few people I knew at that time--that I knew--was going hungry, you know.  I'm quite sure there were. But, you know, people helped each other out.  You go out and you kill some hogs and, which we had a plenty of those, you, you share it with your, with your neighbors.  If they needed something--I was thinking this morning--I don't know why that came up this morning on my way in--just if you needed a cup of sugar or something like that and go next door and ask for a cup of sugar (laughter).  And I don't know if you ever paid them back or if they ever paid back, but, you know, it was no, you know, no big deal.  But, you know, there was some negative sides of growing up.  You know, there was people who--who was not what we would call the highest standards people in the community.  You know, we had people killing each other, cutting each other up, and doing those kinds of things.  But it was not as bad as it is now--it's a whole different, you know, perspective and--.  But I, I enjoyed my childhood.
Speaker 1: And you know, when you think about those early years, can you tell me what sights, sounds, and smells, you know, if you take yourself back, the memories of childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, from a sight standpoint (pause) it was not always that good.  When you looked around the community and you saw the conditions that a lot of our people lived in, sh-, as we used to call them, shotgun houses, homes that in the wintertime were, were cold because of the condition of the, the situations.  But there were beauty also in the extent, once again, that we were able to, to help each other out.  I can remember some of the, you know, school situations--being involved and, and the beauty of seeing how black people can pull things off and, and to, you know, to, to get things done like that.  From the standpoint of s-, smell, it was probably not that bad overall, but, you know, we did have areas in the community even where I lived up to a period of time where we had outdoor toilets and those kind of things.  And some time of year you knew they were there.  And also even in the city we had, you know, animals, pigs, and hogs, and, and cows and those kinds of things that, you know, presented a, a unique odor.  But I can remember going to church homecomings and special programs where they had food on the ground and, and those kinds of things and you, you had all of the, the good food out there and, and the smell of that was just, the aroma was just super.  And the taste--you know, very good, very, very good food.  And just and from a sight standpoint seeing the black people come together really enjoying the moment because for a lot of people--that moment only came every so often because of the environment we had to live in at that time, not only here, but throughout the South.
Speaker 1: And when you say "food on the ground," what does that mean?  Was that food c-, cooked in a pit?  I--.
Speaker 2: Not, no, no, no, no, no, darlin', not, not really.  But, yes, we can talk about that also.  But when I say food on the grounds in the South, at least here in Milledgeville [Georgia] and in the South and especially in this area--once a year most of your churches had what we call homecomings.  And, and, and it still happens where it's an, it's a time when a lot of family members would come back from up North, back to the South during that period of time for a church gathering.  And it was a, basically a all-day type thing.  And food was served, when we say on the ground, it was either laid out on the ground, you know, like a picnic situation or they had tables out there.  And, and the different members of the church and friends would bring these boxes with food in it--chicken and cakes and, you know, all those kind of things and, and in some instances there were, you know, barbecue hogs, people done barbecued the hogs and brought those or they did it on the ground.  But most barbecue down here is not done in, in the pits, itself, but, in a ground pit, but they are pits that are constructed out of concrete blocks or something like that.
Story_ID: 7926
Speaker 1: Now what was the young Floyd Griffin like?  Was he or were you, you know, were you outgoing, were you mischievous, were you a dreamer, were you--I mean what were you like?
Speaker 2: All of the above.  You really need to probably talk to my sister [Delbra Griffin Waller] and brother [Toney Willis Griffin] about that.  But I was a, I was a dreamer.  I always felt that you could do anything that you wanted to do.  Even at that time for some reason I just felt that, you know, I could be an Army officer, I could become a contractor or a construction person.  I felt that I could play football with the big boys and when I only weighed a hundred and ten pounds wet.  I was, stayed in, I wouldn't say stayed in trouble, trouble, but, you know, my, I was always into something, and not from the standpoint of the type of trouble if we get into criminal trouble or something like that.  I was never in anything like that.  But around the house I would sneak and do things and just stand in the mischievous, that thing.  And then the older I got, obviously, I grew up and, and start seeing things a little bit different.  But I always felt that I could make things happen.
Story_ID: 7927
Speaker 1: Now elementary school was what school?
Speaker 2: Well, I started out sc-, school in a little church school called Mount Hill [School, Milledgeville, Georgia] 'cause the Mount Hill Baptist Church--within the same block of where I lived.  And I went to that school up through the third grade.  And there were several classes, grades in that, in that school, and I think it was fir-, first through third.  And I'll never forget the, the teacher there, Miss Ray (ph.).  And that's where really, I guess, I truly started, which you should, that's where I really s-, really started the learning process, because of her.  And she had all these different class groups, and she was able to make that happen.
Story_ID: 7928
Speaker 1: We were talking about your school, you know, your elementary school [Mount Hill School, Milledgeville, Georgia], you know, was actually--was it a church school?  It was--or was it--?
Speaker 2: No, no it was not a church school.  It was a public school.  But you'll find back in those, during that time frame, not only here in Milledgeville [Georgia], but in a number of communities in the South, the school system, especially the early years and, and in some cases throughout, the schools were conducted in, in churches.  And that's the way, you know, it were here in Milledgeville until, until, you know, the, the new schools was built in about '55 [1955], '56 [1956], '57 [1957] town--time frame.  So it was a public school but just in the church [Mount Hill Baptist Church].
Speaker 1: Did you--so at third grade where did you go on to?
Speaker 2: So at fourth grade--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Fourth grade, sorry.
Speaker 2: --I moved to Carver Elementary School [Milledgeville, Georgia].  And I was there until seventh grade.  And then that's when Boddie High School [Milledgeville, Georgia] was built.  Carver--it was really Carver Elementary and High School.  It was in the same location until the, until the high school was constructed.
Story_ID: 7929
Speaker 1: And were there any teachers there that influenced you or was there any development, you know, additional development occurring at that time between third and seventh grade?
Speaker 2: I can't remember anyone that stood out between the third and, you know, and the fourth and, and, and seventh grade.  But after that there was Dr.--can't think of his name now, but there's Miss Lofton, who was an English teacher who had a significant impact on almost of the, the students at that time frame.  And she had a, a major impact.  And Dr. [Joseph] Graham, Mr. Graham, who was the principal of the [black] high school [Boddie High School, Milledgeville, Georgia] had a very significant impact on me in going on off to college.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about Miss Lofton and Mr. Graham and tell us exactly what impact they had?
Speaker 2: Well, Miss Lofton was the premier English teacher who was--wanted you really to be the whole person also.  You know, she wanted you to speak the perfect English and, and write well and, and she did those kinds of things to make sure that you, you know, got that type of education a little--we didn't necessarily have the books, the up-to-date books, but, you know, she taught from her experience and from her knowledge of the, of the, of the language and, and making sure that we, you know, read well, we could write well, speak.  You know, we did all those kinds of things.  And, and I can also remember her, and I'll never forget this--and I don't know how this ended up in, in a language class, but--how you eat soup.  You use the spoon, you know, you always dip away from you, you know.  And I, and I remember, now this small things like that that's, you know, it help prepared you for life.  And, and Dr. Graham, Mr. Graham was really the principal of the high school, and he was, he worked all the time.  He was at the school all the time.  And he made sure that any- and everyone that wanted to go to college could afford to--and even if they couldn't afford to go to college, he tried, he found a way to make that happen through scholarships and et cetera.  And he had a brother who was the vice president of Paine College in Augusta, Georgia.  And a number of high students ended up going to Paine College because of that connection.  And a number of our students went to Fort Valley and Savannah State, those colleges here in, in Georgia.  And I know he had an impact on me getting into Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama].  We had several students down at Tuskegee before I got there.  And, and he was just one of those kind of people that looked out for all of the students and, and did everything he could to keep them in school, to finish high school, also.  He understood the importance of, of having a high school diploma.
Story_ID: 7930
Speaker 1: So it was time then--so you're, you're in high school--are you involved in any extracurricular activities and can you discuss that and--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I can remember the first yearbook we had, and I was very heavily involved in that.  I was on the layout team and did some things like that.  I also, I was on the football team, I was involved in sports.  And I was not a--physically I was a small person at least from the weight standpoint.  And, but I in-, I was involved in football for about three or four years, I think.
Speaker 1: Now--.
Speaker 2: Oh, and I was in the band, and I was in the choir and did all that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 7931
Speaker 1: Now, what are you thinking?  You know, you said that you had always from an early age been interested in the building, you know, and bricklaying, you know, those trades, and you said that influenced you going to Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama], but what actually led, you know, into your decision?  How did the, how did the decision even come about?
Speaker 2: To go to Tuskegee?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Well, there were, as I stated, there were two things I wanted to do.  I wanted to go in the Army, and I wanted to go into, in the construction arena.  And at that time it was not too many colleges that offered both, and, and especially black colleges.  We still had segregation at that time.  I think the only other school was Savannah State [College, Savannah, Georgia], and Savannah State had a construction program and a, an ROTC [Reserve Officers Training Corps] program.  And I knew there were a couple of Milledgeville [Georgia] people at Tuskegee who I knew relatively well, and, and that had an influence on me going down to Tuskegee.  But I knew that they had a, a strong ROTC program and, you know, we had the, a number of black high-ranking officers at that time who came out of Tuskegee.  And, you know, that had an influence on me going there.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the black high-ranking (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) [General Daniel] Chappy James.  Remember Chappy James--was a Tuskegee graduate.  I'm not sure if I--Benjamin [O.] Davis's father or Benjamin Davis were at Tuskegee, completed Tuskegee, or they went through the, the Tuskegee Airmen's program.  And, and that, you know, and that had an impact on me.  So, and one of the--at Tuskegee it was a requirement to wear your uniforms, I mean, during the ROTC program Army or Air Force during your first two years.  So, the one or two or three or four individuals from Milledgeville that had gone to Tuskegee, they came back and, and on the holidays and they were wearing their uniforms.  They didn't have to, but they were wearing the uniforms.  So that had a impact also.  And I went down and I visited Tuskegee, and I say this is where I want to go to school.  And, obviously, the Tuskegee influence and history with Booker T. Washington and George Washin-, George Washington Carver--all of that had an impact on me going there.
Story_ID: 7932
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is really, when you go there [to college at Tuskegee Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] , is this your first time away from home?
Speaker 2: Yes, basically, that's first time away from home.
Speaker 1: And, and your mother [Ruth Evans Griffin] and father [Floyd L. Griffin, Sr.] are losing their oldest son.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: So how was that experience, I mean, when you go off to school?
Speaker 2: For the first time?  Well, it was a, it was a little frightening initially, but, you know, I was one of those kind of bold and adventurous persons anyway.  And, and I just got there and, and, and got involved.  I went down early because I was in the band.  And so I got there two or three weeks earlier and, and kind of got to know some of the so-called big boys on campus from Georgia, from Atlanta, and those areas, and they kind of took me under their, their wing because I was a homeboy and kind of showed me the ropes.  And I was very--after a few days I felt very comfortable and just got in the groove.
Speaker 1: And what--did you immediately go and get involved in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and in the building trades?  Is that what you, I mean, what courses--I'm just trying understand what you went through.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Tuskegee at that time, if you, you know, if you were a healthy, young male and et cetera, y-, you were required to take ROTC.  We had two ROTCs, Army and Air Force.  You could choose between the two.  The first two years it was a requirement, okay.  But it was not a requirement for me all of that because I wanted to do it anyways.  So, I went into the Army ROTC program.  The, the building construction program I started immediately because at that time in Tuskegee  you could start your major area during your, your freshman year.  So I started out taking, other than the, you know, the traditional academic requirements like the English and math and et cetera, started taking a few of the, the construction courses like carpentry, brick-, bricklaying and architectural courses and those kind of, those--electrician and those kind of courses.
Speaker 1: In those courses were pe-, were you actually building things, you know, would that, would you work as teams building things or was it more like shop inside of, you know, a built, you know (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Ear-, early on it was more like shop, you know, and then as the program, as the years, as you went up through your junior and senior year you got involved in, in, in, in some actual experiences.  And, and I, I did some subcontracting.  I had my little subcontracting company there my junior or senior year is where I went out and actually contracted work out and had people working for me.
Speaker 1: So you were pretty entr--you had learned that from your father to be pretty entrepreneurial.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was trying to make money.  I was trying to survive and, and make things happen.
Story_ID: 7933
Speaker 1: Do you feel that you got good training during school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I got great training not only from a, a academic standpoint, but from the, from life and especially the social side and, and working with people and et cetera because it was so many things going on at Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University] at that time.  It was during the peak of the Civil Rghts Movement  during the '60s [1960s].  I was there '62 [1962] through '67 [1967].  I was very much involved in that, my wife [Nathalie Griffin] and I--my wife, that's where I met my wife at Tuskegee.  And we marched the march [1965] from Selma [Alabama] to, to Montgomery [Alabama].  And I did not, I was not on the entire march and I think very few people was on the entire march, but we joined the march and we sent busloads of students over to participate in the march.  And not only that march, a number of other marches around Montgomery and, and in Tuskegee areas we were involved.  And we had another program called the Tuskegee Institute Community Action Program [sic, Tuskegee Institute Community Education Project], TICEP--a very energetic Dean of Students [P.B. Phillips, Dean of Student Affairs] who came in and started this community action program dealing with poverty-stricken areas where we got involved in, in tutoring and construction-related things and helping some of the individuals who was living in very bad conditions upgrade their quality of life, their living, and et cetera.  And one summer we had a full summer's program where students came from various parts of the United States and especially white students came down from one of the northern universities to, to work with this program.  Now can you imagine in 1964 or maybe it was '65 [1965] we have all of these white students running around, not running around, but working around Alabama and especially the Black Belt like Selma and Lowndes county and et cetera with black students and young white girls and, and black males working together and, and living in different places trying to upgrade the poverty-stricken areas--that was, that was a tremendous experience.  And by virtue of doing that, you know, all of that helped me when I went off into the military.
Speaker 1: The exposure.
Speaker 2: The exposure, yes, and the involvement.
Speaker 1: I want to ask the, you know--a lot of the activity around the Civil Rghts Movement actually started in the '50s [1950s] and I'm wondering if you have any sense of that, you know, living here in Milledgeville [Georgia] before, you know, you went off to school?  A little bit more, you became aware more, you know, during the more active, you know, sit-in period or march period that occurred
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, I became aware before I left Milledgeville because I can remember the Little Rock inc-, incident when the, the schools was integrated there or desegregated, I guess, and seeing it on TV.  And I don't know how old I was then at that time because I don't even remember exactly when that happened, but, obviously, it was in the late, mid-'50s [1950s], I would guess, '54 [1954] or '55 [1955].  And that start, you know, having an impact because you say, well, gee whiz, looks like things are gonna start changing around here.  And then you, and then I go off to, to Tuskegee and, and really that's when, you know, in the '60s [1960s] it's--early '60s [1960s], mid-'60s [1960s]--is when the Civil Rights Movement was pretty much at its peak and things was, was happening all over the South and especially in, in Alabama.  I can remember seeing on TV the dogs and, and, and the situation down in Birmingham--never dreaming that I would be a part of that in that, you know, in that arena at the time that, you know, I was involved.  So, it had a tremendous impact on who I am today.
Speaker 1: Now, the ambitious dean you said that started the, the community poverty program, what was her name?
Speaker 2: It was a male--Phillips, Dean Phillips [P.B. Phillips, Dean of Student Affairs].  And I can't think of Phillips's n-, last name.  But he was a young guy.  You know, he was not too much older than, than we were.
Speaker 1: And do you think the people who came down from the, the North, were they a part of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] at all?  Was that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, well, there were people there from SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], I mean, in the area and CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] and, and those, you know, civil right groups.  But, no, these individuals, you, the white students--they came down from a university up north, and I can't remember now what university.
Speaker 1: And that was sort of a very strange experience where people from the South who had not been north, you know, to sort of see white, you know, they were--what were the--so were they naïve in some respects, you know, about the South?  I mean, what was that whole sort of dynamic?  Or were you just, were people just happy to see people, you know, whites who were willing to help?  Was it--I'm just trying to get a sense (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, I think it was a combination of all of that.  You know, there were--you know, there was white people involved in the civil rights movement.  There were a number killed in Alabama.  And, and, and some of them were killed when, when I was there and, and, and in the areas we were out working during the civil rights movement.  But these students came down and why they came--it was a movement, and I think they had a commitment and wanted to participate and see a change in the South.  It could have had--obviously, it had something to do with the commitment of the university that they attended, it had a commitment to do with Tuskegee, and really had a commitment of this young dean, Dean Phillips, in bringing those students down.  And it was a, a learning experience for the, the Tuskegee students involved working with sou-, northern white students and giving them an opportunity to see the culture and, and how people were living in Alabama.  The Alabamians, both black and white--it was a, it was a learning experience.  We had whites obviously was not pleased with that at all.  You had blacks that didn't know how to deal with it and, and was kind of stand-backish because, you know, they, the trust thing.  You know, it was, you know, "What's going on here?" So it was not a easy process moving into some of these communities especially down in the Black Belt in, into Selma and Lowndes county areas and et cetera.  It was not a easy situation.  You know, you got blacks and whites riding down the highway together in the same automobiles and, and going into these different poverty areas and trying to talk to people who were not educated and trying to get them to understand why you are there and what you are trying to.  And, and, you know, you couldn't change this overnight because we were really only talking about a summer program.  Now we did continue some of those programs, but not at the, the degree of, you know, a summer program.
Story_ID: 7934
Speaker 1: The other question I have for you--when you went from mid-Georgia where you're from to, you know, Tuskegee, you know, Alabama, was there a difference or was it just sort of one and the same?  Were there any differences in the com-, you know, the types of community and the exposure?  Now is there just difference between people from Georgia and people from Alabama?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a, there, there is a, there, you know, there are a number of similarities and there are some differences.  Obviously, when I went to Tuskegee, I, you know, I went into a college community.  And especially around Tuskegee--see, that was a Tuskegee Institute, Alabama.  And that's pretty much the college areas at that time.  And there's a-, another story about that and how Tuskegee became Tuskegee Institute and the (go millions?) story and, and how that happened.  And then there was, you know, Tuskegee itself.  But around the university area, you know, you were--the, the environment was an educated environment, and most of the people you came in contact with even when you went out in that general area in the community were college professors and, and the staff who were educated.  But if--all you had to do is go a few miles out and you would think that you were right here in middle of Georgia to some degree.  So it was not a major, major difference, but there is some very, very impoverished areas in Alabama now.  I'm telling you, it was really--I had not seen that type of situation here in, in Georgia, although my travel in Georgia was not that great.  But, what I had seen in Alabama was really, really bad.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the story about--you said there's a whole story behind Tuskegee Institute and, and then you said (unclear).
Speaker 2: There was a Dr. [Charles Goode] Gomillion who was--.
Speaker 1: Yes, can you spell that name?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: I think it (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, it was a court case. [Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 1960]  And I can't remember the whole story now--it's been so long.  But, see, there was Tuskegee and, and how the Tuskegee blacks were treated and et cetera and Dr. Gomillion along with some other people sued [to challenge a case of gerrymandering that excluded Tuskegee Institute and its black population from the city]  And, and based on that suit [sic] that became Tuskegee, Tuskegee Institute, Alabama.  It became a separate entity of Tuskegee, Alabama.  It was not a separate government where you had local elected officials et cetera, but you had then--there was a, there was a post office out there and where Tuskegee received its mail different from, from the people downtown.
Speaker 1: So you mean the college, itself, became its own sort of separate community. Tuskegee Institute became its own like, not its own city, but its own sort of--.
Speaker 2: Community and a certain area, geographic area around Tuskegee Institute.  Right.
Story_ID: 7935
Speaker 1: Now, was there anything else significant about your time at Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] 'cause you graduate and go on to the service?
Speaker 2: To the service, right.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Was there anything else about the college, I mean the college experience besides the year after then, you know, and then having your, you know, you're doing your subcontracting and--?
Speaker 2: Well, it was--.
Speaker 1: And your meeting your wife.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and meeting my wife.  That was a, that was important and that was significant.  But it was just a--you know, I think people go through stages in life and, and there are certain things that you should experience during that stage of life.  And this was one stage of life that, that I went through--was my early high education opportunity.  And, and I took advantage of that in a number of ways--at least Tuskegee gave me the opportunity to take advantage of that and start maturing me into where I needed to go during that stage of life.  It just had so many things to offer, you know.  And at that time, obviously, you know, you go through a certain stage and say why are we doing this?  We had to go to Chapel on, during the fr-, the freshman and sophomore years.  We had to go to Vespers.  Vespers was a evening--or Sunday afternoon or evening program where different arts and entertainment was presented to us.  You know, we would have operas to come in, maybe.  We would have a balle, ballet company to come in.  We would have someone to come in and, and speak with some notoriety.  It was things that helped to groom you and, and prepare you for life other than just the academic piece, you know--the other quality of life things that we need to have.  And at that time, you know, we just probably didn't understand that.  You would try to find ways to, to get out of going and, and, and you would have so many cuts during the semester that you didn't have to go, maybe three that you didn't have to go.  And most of us took those things.  But it was part of the, the overall environment.  And we had some very, some very distinguished professors at Tuskegee, both black and white, see, so all of the, our professors were not, was not black.  I can, I can remember this white history professor I had, Dr. Stallings (ph.)--heavy, (points at head) very heavy.  This guy would walk into a lecture room of about three or four hundred students without any notes at all and for fifty minutes--he would walk in, he would look across the classroom, and he would start lecturing for fifty minutes--no notes at all.  Very impressed with that.  And he could tell who was in the classroom because he stopped me a couple times on campus and say, "Mr. Griffin, I didn't see you in class yesterday."  And he'd blow your mind.  You got three hundred students in there and didn't have a seating arrangement or anything.  And, but he had a impact because I used to go by--he lived on campus in the, in the hotel on campus.  And I would go by and talk to him about a number of things, but especially about the class and get an idea of what I needed to really concentrate on for the exams and et cetera.  But he was very, very impressive.  Those are the kind of people we had at Tuskegee.
Story_ID: 7936
Speaker 1: And, you know, you're graduating in what year?
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967].  And isn't that--well, maybe a few years a--wasn't it the time when there's some questioning about the Vietnam War.  Is that a (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's when it started.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay, so now had Martin Luther King [Jr.], Reverend King, had he started questioning it at that, you know, at the time mentioned?
Speaker 2: I can't, I really can't remember, but I would think so because, see, Dr. King was assassinated in, in '68 [1968], a year after I had gone in service.  And I remember that day very, very vi-, vividly.  And I know exactly where I was and what I was doing and et cetera.  Yes, that was about the time he had start questioning, maybe a little bit earlier than that.
Speaker 1: So that didn't make you question, you know, your wanting, your dream of wanting to go into the service?  There was none of that?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm quite sure--it, it did have, yes, it did have some impact.  I mean it did have some impact on me thinking about that.  Not only then, but at--maybe even a little bit earlier during, back dur-, even during the Civil Rights Movement because, see, one of the things that we could not have--any type of record, criminal record or anything like that to go into the military.  So I had to think very hard about going out participating in those, in the march and the movements.  But even before Dr. King was assassinated, and when I was on active duty, you know, there was some riots and those kind of things going on, and the military was involved in, in helping to quell some of those situations.  And, you know, it did have some impact on thinking about those--I remember when Dr. King was assassinated.  I, I was stationed at Tacoma, Washington.  But when he was assassinated I was back in the Washington, DC area, at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, going through a course.  And I finished the course the same day he was assassinated or the day before he was assassinated, something like that, and went back to Washington.  And my unit was on alert for riot control, for, for the Watts area out in [Los Angeles] California.  And not only me but a number of my fellow black officers--we talked about that and just hoped that we did not, our unit was not called up to go out and, and how were we gonna deal with that.  We had an obligation to the military and we had to do it, but it was always something in the back of your, our minds all up through that period of time when there were a number of disturbances going on around the country from the standpoint of riots.
Story_ID: 7937
Speaker 1: When things really start making a significant turn.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And most of those individuals ended up having a--.
Speaker 2: Problems.
Speaker 1: --having problems.  Now you know Julian, Julian Bond was involved in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and although he turned his, you know, kind of turned his life around a little bit from the standpoint of a tragic situation--.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) his drugs.
Speaker 1: Say again.
Speaker 2: His drugs after (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, he had problems with that and, and some other--those situations.
Story_ID: 7938
Speaker 1: Now, so you, you joined the service, you know, you, you joined the Army.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And now where're you stationed out of (unclear)?
Speaker 2: My, my--initially?  Initially was Fort Lewis, Washington, in Tacoma, Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, for about a year.
Speaker 1: And do you think at this point you want to be a career person in the service?  Is that what your thoughts are?
Speaker 2: I had a, I had some mixed emotions when I went in, if I wanted to, you know, a career situation.  But after about a year or maybe two years, I decided that I probably should stay around.  Because, you know, at that time in 1966, '67 [1967], '68 [1968] timeframe, things, just--things start changing to some degree for, you know, for blacks, but we still hadn't gotten to that point where, where I felt comfortable in going out into the world--that's what we used to call it--and, and, and starting a, starting a career.  I was married, I had a, had a, had a young son [Brian Griffin] at the time, and I think my wife [Nathalie Huffman Griffin] was pregnant, pregnant again.  And that's when some of the community action programs begun, you know, where the government was, you know, putting money into different community programs around the country and, and I started to get out and get involved in that, you know, into that situation.  But I di-, just didn't feel comfortable about that.  And one of the things that I wanted to do, always I wanted to do, was fly.  And then a opportunity became available for me to go to flight school, helicopter school.  And so I decided to, to sign up for that to see what would happen.  And I was selected--and it was during the Vietnam days also.  But I decided to do that and it paid a little bit more money and it was exciting.
Story_ID: 7939
Speaker 1: Why didn't you choose the Air Force, though?
Speaker 2: Well, early on, you know, when I went off to college and as I was in the program, I didn't really think about it that much because, see, at Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] at the time the Tuskegee Army program did not have a flight program.  And I just didn't have any real desire to go in the Air Force at that, you know, at that point in time.  I wanted to be an engineer, not a, an aviator.  And I wanted to be out where the rubber meets the roads.  You know, the Air Force was kind of a laid back, you know, situation and et cetera.  And I, I felt I--for some reason I felt that I had a better opportunity to move up the career ladder in the, in the Army versus the Air Force.  And my senior year, the Army got an ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], got an Army flight program.  And it was really too late for me to, to go through that, that program.  So after I got in the Army after one year or so I decided I would see what happened and--.  So and I, and I could do both.  At that time you could be what we called, you had to be in a branch other than that, the flight program.  So I was in the Corps of Engineers and I went off to flight school.  So I was dual, and I ended up doing a little bit of both over a, a period of time before the Army--after Vietnam the Army went to a aviation branch.  And I was a major then.  I had been in the Army about twelve or thirteen years.  And I had a choice of staying in the Corps of Engineers or going into the, into the aviation branch.  And I decided to stay into the Corps because I didn't want to basically start over again in the aviation branch at the rank I was.  I could have, but I just decided that was not in my best interest.
Speaker 1: So did you--you got shipped off to Vietnam after going to flight school?
Speaker 2: After going to flight school I spent a year in the, in the States, went back up in the Washington, DC, area for a year.  And after that year I went back to a, a couple of courses, aviation course.  I went through the instructor pilots' program.  Then I went to Vietnam.
Story_ID: 7940
Speaker 1: You get to Vietnam and what, what is that experience like?
Speaker 2: Hard to describe.  Fly in to Vietnam--the first thing was the odor.  It's just, you know, it was just--first time I'd been in, really been out of the, the United States for any period of time.  I'd been to Panama and a couple of places like that, but not in a third world country.  And, and, you know, it was just a different, different odor.  A lot of it came, enou-, some of it came from burning the, the, your waste, you know, human waste.  And, and that's what happened over there.  You burned it--at least in, from the mili-, the military side of the house.  And then all of the, all of the military activity around you in a different way than in the, in the United States--everybody's, you know, walking around with their weapons.  And then we had to go through a training orientation program in country and wait then to determine what unit you were going to be shipped to.  That took about, you know, two or three weeks before you, we were actually shipped out to a unit.  And then going out to a unit and just getting adjusted to the daily routine, and a daily routine of working twenty-four/seven, basically, for a, almost a year.  I was an instructor pilot in a couple of the different helicopters, and, and I spent, you know, a lot of my time in, in that, doing that type of--operations--giving what we call check rides.  And then we had to go and give each pilots--every so many hours they would have to have check rides and et cetera.  I also flew on some combat mission when I was also the, the, the unit's intelligence officer--we called it S2 officer.  But it was not, you know, it was not all bad.  We ate well and especially in the, as pilots and in, in those units we normally had a hot meal every night.  And, and most of the soldiers in Vietnam had hot meals every day unless you was out on a long, you know, combat mission.  And we had entertainment.  I remember flying around a couple of days Miss Black America.  Came over and, and I was chosen to, to fly her around the sector that, that we operated in.  And she was from Birmingham, Alabama, and I told her, asked her to contact my family when she got back, and she did that.  And when I came back to, to the States, one, at one point in time when I was in Birmingham just walking down the street I ran into her.  And it's just amazing how small the world is.  But Vietnam was interesting and something I don't talk about too often.
Speaker 1: You weren't on the front line then--why?
Speaker 2: Well, in Vietnam everywhere was the fr-, front line.  It's not a traditional, it was not a conventional war.  You think about World War I or II or something like that.  It was a guerilla-type operation, so anywhere in Vietnam was, was really, you know, you could have action almost anywhere.  But there were operations that took place that put you on the front line.  But most of your helicopter pilots who flew combat missions was on the quote/unquote front lines because you're flying out into the different operational areas and you could be fired on at any point in time, which we were quite often.
Speaker 1: So, was that--did Vietnam--were you affected?  A lot of people were affected on that experience.  You know, I've had friends or people I went to school with who came back really sort of damaged goods but that doesn't seem like that happened to you .
Speaker 2: No, because I wouldn't allow it to happen to me.  I don't--one of the things that I learned in life--don't dwell on the past.  Okay, it's--you need to understand the past and appreciate the past, but don't allow the past to control the present and prepare you for the future.  And, and the same way with Vietnam.  I had some, some bad experiences there but not as bad as, you know, some other people.  I had some very good friends to, to lose their lives.  I had some comrades who lost their lives within two or three days from leaving Vietnam.  And those, you know, those situation have everlasting impact.  But it also, it also can help you grow into a better person and, and appreciate life and to appreciate human beings and to appreciate having a opportunity to know people like that because they were good people.  And they had something to offer, and they offered a lot for their country.  But I don't dwell on that.  And I don't talk about Vietnam a lot because it was not the best experience of my, of my, my life and my career.  Although from a professional standpoint, it was good for me.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we're in the military--when I was in the military, you're in, in the military to prepare for combat when you are called on for your country, by your country to do so.  And, during that time frame, if you did not go into combat, it would be very difficult for you to have 'bat on your resume, if you want to call it that, in your records, to be considered for promotion and advancement.  And that's very significant to have had that opportu-, taking advantage of that opportunity.  So when people are sitting down who's making the d-, determination of whether you gonna get promoted to the next rank or some very important positions, that's very critical for them to look at that and say, okay, this guy served in Vietnam, you know, whatever's going on at that time, and give a nod.  So, professionally, it was very important for me to be able to achieve what I did over the twenty-three years I was in the Army.
Story_ID: 7941
Speaker 1: Now you come back [from service in Vietnam] and now where are you stationed?  Do you move up a rank when you come back?
Speaker 2: Well--let me think now.  No, b-, because it really not, that's not the way the, the grades or ranks is determined.  But I came back to Fort Bragg, North Carolina and stayed there two years with [U.S. Army] Special Forces, John F. Kennedy Center for Military Assistance.  And from there I go back to the Washington, DC, area to what we called advanced courses--probably something like going off getting a, a master's degree.  It's a, a required-type course for the branch that I was in.  I stayed there for a year and then I went off and got my master's degree for a year.
Speaker 1: And then after that?
Speaker 2: I, I was stationed on the Military Sci-, at the Military Science Department ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] at Wake Forest University [Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  And I started an ROTC program at Winston-Salem State University [Winston-Salem, North Carolina], coached on two undefeated football teams at Winston-Salem State University--ranked number one in the country for two years.  Great experience.  That was, that, that was probably professionally and personally was the best four years of time frame of my entire military career.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I want to understand.  So, you're still in the military, but you get this position teaching, you know--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --like to start up a--I don't understand how the, how that came about--you, you actually start a ROTC program at Winston.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, we started two ROTC programs.  I was a--you know, there are different things you do in the military, and it, it, you know, it would take more time to try to explain the whole situation.  But I was, I requested and I was selected to go to an ROTC program.  And Wake Forest in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Winston-Salem State was where, was one of the available opportunities at that time.  And so I selected to go there and I was chosen to go there.  Wake Forest had a, already had its program in place.  Winston-Salem State's program was in its infancy, so I was chosen to go and work both places and really get the program started at Winston-Salem State University, which I did.  Wake Forest is a, a predominantly white college, Baptist influence, and Winston-Salem State was a predominantly black university, state university.  And there was another private college in west, in High Point, North Carolina.  High Point, North Carolina is, is, is the furniture capital of really the South or maybe even the, the United States--that, you know, that area.  And there was High Point College there, and I started an ROTC program for them also during that (unclear).
Speaker 1: And was this the policy of the, the, you know, the service is to start ROTC?  Okay.  It sort of is an expansion?
Speaker 2: It was an expansion program.  They were going through an expansion period.  And Winston-Salem State, since it was a predominantly black university, they wanted to--and the college wanted a program and the Army agreed to that.  It was not a separate program.  It was a program with Wake Forest University, where you would not have to go off and set up a separate program that early on because it cost a lot of money to do that.  And, and they wanted to wait and see if the program would be successful enough to have its, its own program.
Speaker 1: And did you find, find at that time--'cause people, you know, this is after the, after war thing that people--it was hard to recruit people, I mean, much different than when you came along?
Speaker 2: Right.  That was a challenge, a big challenge and especially at Wake Forest, which was, you know, something like a Ivy League school in the South, a very prominent university.  You have some of your best and brightest white students--and there are black students, too, but it's predominantly white school--going there, so it, it took a lot of creative recruiting into the ROTC program.  One of the tools we, we used was scholarships, full scholarships, and that helped a lot.  And then just regular recruiting.  And we had to change our curriculum and how we, what we offered to the students other than just the military science-type programs.  And I also taught a few courses in, in management at, at Winston-Salem State because my, my master's degree is in contracts and procurement management.  And, and the ROT-, getting involved in the football program--see, I volunteered my services when I coached the offensive backfield.  And that helped to build my ROTC program, especially with the male students.  I had a number of, probably 50 percent or better of my ROTC program was from the athletic department.  And a number of those young men went on into the, you know, the advance program, and, and some of them did not.  And some of them we didn't want to go on in.  But they went into the advance program, got their commissions and has done extremely well in the military. They call me off and on and, and, and talk to me about what they are doing.  And some of them r-, have retired and, and call and ask for, if they could use my name to help them get a job here and there.  And I'm very proud of that.

Speaker 1: Well, so you start coaching [football at Winston-Salem State University] what--you coached the whole time as a volunteer, then.
Speaker 2: I was there for four years, and, and I coached three years as a, as a volunteer.
Speaker 1: And, and how was the team when you first took over and what was the, the--why, why was it so successful?
Speaker 2: (laughter) Well, the, the head coach, who was black, was at Wake Forest coaching the year I got there.  And, we got to know each other very early on.  And after that first semester I was there, he was selected to head the football program at Winston-Salem State University.  The other coach was relieved of his duties because they had a--I don't know--two or three seasons where they were not successful.  So Bill Hayes and I went over--he asked me, say, eh--you know how you do friends--you say, well, look, if anything I can help you with, I, I would, you know, I'll give you a hand.  So one day he said, "I need some help.  We don't have a lot of money.  I need some coaches.  Will you come over and, and help us coach?" or something like that.  I said, "Well, Bill, I don't know anything about coaching college ball.  I played high school ball and that was way back when."  And he said, "Well, come on, you can."  And I said, "Well, I played running back, and I'll take a look at it.  And I'll just help you during the spring, spring ball."  And, and, which I did.  And, and the first year--I can't remember the record, but we were like maybe one game or two games from five hundred ball.  And, and, and one or two of those games we just lost by, you know, maybe a touchdown or a field goal or something like that.  And I'll never forget during the next summer when we were planning for the next year, Bill asked me, say--they called me Griff or they called me Cap--I was a captain then so they called me Cap--and he said, "Cap, you know, what are we going to do the next year?"  I said, "Well, Bill, if we do this and we do that, we will go undefeated."  He said, "Now we can do that."  I said, "We will go undefeated."  And we did those things, and we went undefeated--twelve and zero, I think.  It was eleven or twelve and zero and went to a bowl game.  And the next year we did the same thing--went undefeated.  And that was--it's tough to go undefeated.
Speaker 1: So you went--you were in the bowl in the--?
Speaker 2: We were in a bowl game.  It was called the Gold Bowl or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was up in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know they have bowl games all around the country.
Story_ID: 7943
Speaker 1: So you really like that time and that time--you liked that area of the country, too?
Speaker 2: I almost got out of the Army and stayed there because, you know, my, my, my sons [Brian Griffin and Eric Griffin] had got involved, and they were doing well.  And my wife [Nathalie Elaine Griffin] enjoyed the area.  And Winston-Salem [North Carolina] was a nice small city, which had a lot to offer.  And the quality of life and some of the cultural things--and we developed a lot of good friends there.  And that's the first time we had stayed in one place that long, you know, four years a long time for a military person to stay in one place.  And, matter of fact, it was a three-year assignment, and I asked for an extension for a fourth year.  And, and always that carrot sticks out there when you start--it seem like in the military when you decide you want to make, do a reverse thing, something happens.  I came along and I came out on the Majors List, and I got promoted to major.  So, doing that you, you take, you accept the promotion, then you also accepting to stay in for another period of time.  And I think it was two or three years.  So that kind of locked me in.
Speaker 1: So when did you--is it major and then colonel?
Speaker 2: It's major then lieutenant colonel--.
Speaker 1: Lieutenant colonel, okay.
Speaker 2: --and then colonel.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's a big deal in the service.  Is it still, rank?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's what it's all about.
Speaker 1: Not (religion?) (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, if you don't get promoted, you don't stay.  You, you know, you can--what we call passovers as officers now.  And if you get passed over--it used to be, I don't know what it is now--say two times, you were, you had to get out.
Speaker 1: So you're, you're moving up.  Why don't you end up ultimately staying in the service, though?
Speaker 2: Well, I stayed for twenty-three years.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was a colonel.  I stayed for twenty-three years.  Could have stayed longer, but I, I guess a number of things happened.  We had moved about thirteen times in twenty-two years or so, and, and I'd had several high-level assignments in Washington [D.C.].  And I was in the Pentagon.  And, and I kept moving around in some high- proce-, profile positions and get it pretty well cleaned up, if you want to call it that, and then they m-, want to move me somewhere else.  And, and I just kind of got tired of that.  Plus my father [Floyd L. Griffin, Sr.] had had a major heart attack about a year before, and my wife's [Nathalie Griffin] parents--her father was not doing well and on up in age.  My sons were--one of them was out of college and the other one--was about a year left, I think.  And the Army wanted me to move to Panama--I think it was Panama--to take on a pretty high-profile position.  And I just didn't want to move.  And then, and, and, and my wife couldn't go.  It was a two-year assignment.  And I just felt at that point in time in my career, and especially since the children were gone and nobody was really gonna be there with her, although that was okay with her, I didn't need that.  So, and I think it was about time for me to, to change and focus on civilian life.  And I just decided to retire.
Speaker 1: Sir, before we get out of your retirement--moved a little too quickly--are the, are there things that you would say that were very significant about, you know, whether it was serving in the Pentagon or, you know, some of the high level [unclear], I mean, things that were significant or that you were proud of or that you look--were extreme learning experience?
Speaker 2: During the, the latter years or throughout the career?
Speaker 1: Throughout your career.
Speaker 2: I tell you what.  I am very proud of my military career.  I did not have what you are gonna call a bad military career.  I would, I could live it over again and basically the same thing and not make any significant changes.  You know, you--it's just like life.  Obviously, there are a few things you would change, but--there, there is no major, major things I would change.  I was blessed.  I had some very important assignments that put me in the position to, you know, to move up the ladder.  I had some positions I'm--I would say at least three-fourths of the major-type positions I had, I was the first black to, to hold those positions, which groo-, helped groom me for what I'm doing now as the first black mayor of Milledgeville [Georgia], a African American mayor, and when I was in the [Georgia state] senate being the first black senator--because it took a, it has taken a lot of the, the, the pressure off of me that one who's not gone through that before would be dwelling on a, a lot of the nonsense that doesn't make any difference anyway.  But you, you know, bring that to the table because you have not had that experience before.  I was the first African American in the Army Corps of Engineers--and we have branches like infantry, engineers, and artillery, and et cetera.  And we have an, an office called--and each one of those called a branch office--and the chief of that branch, who has several people working for him or her, are responsible for determining the assignments of all of the officers in that branch--you know, where they are assigned around the Army's world--and even responsible for determining what schools they go to.  So you kind of have that person's career, future career under your thumbs.  And it's a very, very important and sought-at position as a lieutenant colonel.  And I was chosen to, to head that up for a year as the first African American to have that because everybody, every officer in the Army Corps of Engineers in this case and even some other branches know who you are--it's a very important job, whether you, whether that person is a lieutenant or a four-star general in that corps, they know who you are and because constantly on the telephone talking about assignments and, and doing those kind of things.  So that was an extremely important job.  Then the last job I had in the Army, I was a, I was a full colonel then, and I was responsible for a, basically, a billion dollar construction and contract program around the Army's world.  And had an interface with Congress, or different subcommittees on Congress, and getting those appropriations, or working those appropriations for those programs.  And then I had the execution side of that, which means that I had people working for me around the world.  And--on any given week I probably was somewhere in the world checking some of these programs out.  Now sometime I would stay in, you know, in the Washington area for a couple of weeks or so, but then I could take off and, which happened quite often, and leave Washington and go to Japan and stay a day or so and then into Korea day or so and then into, into Hawaii--and that's normally the route I would take.  Or, go back and stay in Washington for a couple of days and go to Europe or--Germany.
Story_ID: 7944
Speaker 1: I'm wondering if you could comment about the role that the Army or the Armed Services played in your life.
Speaker 2: Well, it has a, it had a very significant impact on who I am today.  You know, spending twenty-three years in, in an institution like the military and the opportunities I had to--from an experience base and from an educational opportunity, you know, going off getting my master's degree and attending the, the top military professional courses, like the Command and General Staff College and the, and the War College.  You know, that's the, the top level of professional schoolings in the military.  And the, the War College, and I went to the National War College.  There are several war colleges, but I went to the National War College in, in Washington, DC.  That's the last professional course that you can take.  And it's one of those courses that you need to have and in some degree must have to even be considered for general officer.  So, all of your general officers in the Army--up to that point, you know--I did everything that, that they had done to prepare myself for general officer.  And that was my s-, next step.  And I, and I think I had at least a 50 percent chance of, of getting selected if I had decided to stay around.  But the impact has just been tremendous because coming out of the military and coming back into the civilian environment from a, you know, professional standpoint and, and from a leadership management standpoint, I had all of those ingredients in place.  I just had to, to learn how to be a quote unquote civilian again and deal with the, basically, the civilian environment on a, you know, a hundred percent basis versus being in the military.
Speaker 1: So what does that, what does that mean in many ways "learning how to be a civilian again"?
Speaker 2: Well, because when you're in the military, it's an institution.  And even working with Department of Army Civilian Personnel, you know, that's an institution also.  And it's, it's a pretty much a professional environment almost twenty-four/seven.  Now, obviously, we didn't, we, we had involvement with the civilian world.  We shopped and had friends and did those kinds of things, but it's still the--my profession was a, more of a different type of professional environment than being out here in the world, being a business person and et cetera.  So that, that was an adjustment.  The people I worked with and especially in my latter years in the Army, all of those people or most of those people were very professional individuals--now it was a different level of competence, but, you know, when you, when I said "Jump.", some--I liked for people to say "How high?", you know.  And I don't mean that literally, but, you know, get the job done.  And we were more success-, job-oriented--get it done and move on.  It's, it was a, especially working in the Pentagon, was a, a very--it was a high-profile position, but very intense, a lot of pressure there.  It's just around-the-clock type situation.  In the civilian world, it's a lot of laid-back people, not criticizing that, but, you know, it's a, just a whole different ballgame.
Story_ID: 7945
Speaker 1: Now, when you decide to leave the military, you decide to come home, right, for family reasons?
Speaker 2: Yes, pretty much so, yeah.
Speaker 1: But your kids are all grown.
Speaker 2: My kids were all grown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't--off--I don't know--.
Speaker 1: Can you give then your wife's name and spell it and your children's names also?
Speaker 2: All right.  My wife [Nathalie Huffman Griffin] is Nathalie, N-A-T-H-A-L-I-E, and her middle initial is E, it's Elaine, E-L-A-I-N-E .  My oldest son is Brian [Griffin], B-R-I-A-N, and he's a captain in the United States Army.  He's a, he's a professor at Clemson University [Clemson, South Carolina] on the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] staff, so he's kind of following in my footsteps to some degree.  And my youngest son, Eric [Griffin], E-R-I-C, and he's an executive in the technology field, computer technology field.
Story_ID: 7946
Speaker 1: Now, how did the decision for you to run for [Georgia] state senate come about?
Speaker 2: Well, when I decided to leave the, the military, and I--and another reason for coming back home--I didn't want to go and work for someone else, and I didn't want to go and go through the process of starting up a business.  So it was, you know, a little bit easier for me to come back to the family business.  When I left the military I decided that I wanted to get into politics.  Okay, I wanted to give something back because I had been blessed.  So first of all we wanted to find a home in the city where it would give me the flexibility of running for almost any office, city-level office, county-level office, and then, you know, your state or federal office.  I really wanted to run for mayor [of Milledgeville, Georgia], at least that's what I had talked about before coming back here.  And then when I came back I got to know the present mayor [Dr. James E. Baugh], who ended up being, we ended up being friends.  And all of a sudden I didn't want to run against him, and he had been around for several years, and he didn't have too many years left.  The present [state] senator [Edwards Culver Kidd, Jr.] was a institution in Georgia.  He had been in politics for forty-something years, and he was not about to leave the seat, but something, he had some political challenges, and, and he was defeated.  The person who replaced him that won the seat [Wilbur Baugh] went in office and did a lousy job the first year.  Got--and the senate, the legislative seats in Georgia are two years, so you can't afford to go in and, and not do well or you can't go in and make any major mistakes, and which he did that first year and he never was--he was not able to recover from it.  So I dec-, I decided to run for the Senate.  I felt that I could do as well or better than he was doing.  I knew it was going to be a major challenge running in a predominantly white district and that, if it had been done before, no one had won.  But I decided what did I have to lose.  So I went for it.
Speaker 1: And you won.
Speaker 2: And won.  Well, initially it was three of, let me see, it was three of us in the race--there two, two white gentlemen and myself.  And then I got in a runoff with the incumbent.  And I felt I had a, a, a pretty good chance then although blacks have a significant problem winning in a runoff against a white, white opposition, and then on top of that an incumbent because turning the vote out the second time is extremely difficult.  But I, but we were able to do it.  And we won by 53 percent, 53 or 54 percent of the vote in a district at that time that was, I think, 62 percent registered white voters.
Speaker 1: What do you think your success was?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the military had, my military experience had, had a greater impact on that.  Secondly, my, my family name recognition, especially in the, in the immediate area.  Now some of those counties, they didn't know my, my, you know, my family per se.  But then we were in the funeral service business and then that helped in those other counties.  And, I just worked hard.  I kept myself out in the district, and I, I didn't only campaign in the black community, I campaigned in the white community.  And the, and, as I stated, the incumbent was not doing that well or had not done that well.  He was not that personable.  Matter of fact, the incumbent was the brother of the mayor of Milledgeville at that time who was, who I had b-, befriend, befriended.  So it was quite interesting.
Speaker 1: So did you, did you find you enjoyed the whole campaigning process?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I got to, I got to, I got meet new people.  I--the challenge of the district and, and it gave me something else to do, you know.  I was getting bored around here just go-, you know, going to the funeral home and, and working there and--.  The funeral business--it comes and goes, you know.  And we, our business is very successful, and we stay busy, but it's not one of those things that you can be, you can end of being very busy seven days and then the next fourteen days--nothing.  And then all of a sudden, boom, you--snowed under.  So I was--and I needed another challenge, you know.  I needed something more challenging than a lot of routine.  It's--I, I just have problems dealing with routine stuff.
Story_ID: 7947
Speaker 1: Now then so you served two years in the [Georgia state] senate before--.
Speaker 2: Four.  I had two terms.
Speaker 1: Two terms.
Speaker 2: Two terms, right.
Speaker 1: So did you learn--I mean, what did you learn out of that experience and what was--it's--your state senate's located in Al--.
Speaker 2: In Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: In Atlanta.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Right, state capital, right.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  What did you--so you were traveling back and forth between Atlanta and here then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I only--out of session.  During the session when the [Georgia] General Assembly actually convened is forty days between the second Tuesday in January until you complete that forty session days--so generally goes into around middle of March or first of April, depending on how many recess that are taken.  But, you know, then I stayed in Atlanta.  I could have commuted.  But I normally stayed in Atlanta Monday through Friday and during--when we're not in the session, I would go to Atlanta periodically.  I had an office up there, and I would go once every other week or sometimes every week, depending on what was going on and if there were committee meetings.
Speaker 1: Now are you proud of, of your accomplishments?  What did you accomplish that you're proud of?
Speaker 2: In the Senate?  Oh, I think there were several things and, and, and I was relatively fortunate to get as many things done as I did during my two terms in the Senate and especially my first couple years being a, a new, newcomer.  See, then--before I answer your question--see, Milledgeville--we have more, probably more state institutions here than anywhere else except the Atlanta area.  So it's just so many things going on just looking at those state institutions, like the colleges and the, the mental institution, and the prison systems, and et cetera.  And I think one of, one of the things I'm very proud of is saving the moving of a forensic service division operation from Milledgeville to Macon or somewhere else.  That was about 450 jobs that some state legislators and even the governor was pushing at one time to move out of Milledgeville.  And that was a, a major effort to, to keep that here.  Several major capital outlay construction projects that I was able to secure for the state university [Georgia College and State University, Milledgeville, Georgia] here and the military academy [Georgia Military College, Milledgeville, Georgia]  And then some legislation--I've passed several pieces of major legislation that had a significant impact in the, in the state.
Speaker 1: And what--what were those?
Speaker 2: One of them dealt with the, the school system and how schools report their annual audit report, if there are difficulties, and, and, and how they have to report that to the community where they'll know if the school system is in a deficit situation, which I had one school system in my district was at the brink of closing because of a major deficit situation, millions of dollars.  And we were able to help save that system, but put legislation in to try to keep that from happening statewide.
Speaker 1: Well, the other question I have for you is that were there things that were surprising, you know, or disappointing or, or that you've learned from to add to your sort of life experience when you were in a, as a state senator?
Speaker 2: Politics is different than just general--life, I'll put it that way.  It's ruthless.  It's a thankless, really a thankless job.  There are people in politics only there for their own benefit financially and otherwise.  In politics and especially at that level I think you can find a little bit of everything--good, bad, and indifferent in people.  And it doesn't take that long for it to start coming out.  And, not only the people who are actually elected officials, those individuals that are associated with it, like lobbyists and people who are out there trying to get their interests or the people who they're representing interests taken care of.  It's nothing wrong with doing that, and there's a place for the lobbyists and for those individuals.  But some of them will do anything unscrupulous and everything else to get that happen, to make that happen.  And I think that's something that I ha-, I learned very quickly, and I'm glad I did because you can really, really get yourself in some s-, in some, in some significant trouble getting involved in those kind of things.
Story_ID: 7948
Speaker 1: Now, your decision to run for mayor [of his hometown, Milledgeville, Georgia, in 2001].  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, after, after leaving the Senate, I ran for lieutenant governor, you know, and I was unsuccessful there.  And, really, I ran for the Senate seat again that I held, and I (laughter), I lost that race, and that was a big surprise.  But that's probably the, the best thing to happen.  And I--there were a group of black women here in Milledgeville--encouraged me and beat me up and did everything else to convince me I needed to run for mayor.  Because I, you know, although when I left the military my goal was to run for mayor, but after being back for a while and all I decided that it's really not what I wanted to do.  But they encouraged me and they talked to me and they beat me up over the head and everything else, not literally, but talked me into, to doing it.  And not only talked me into doing it, and after I decided to do it, they got out and, and was very, very supportive.  Now there were black men also involved and there were whites involved.  But I'm talking about the people who really, really came down and said now you gotta do this.
Speaker 1: Now, it was a, it was a hotly contested race, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a hotly contested race, and it never should have been that way.  Okay.  Not especially after we got into the runoff.  It was the incumbent and a, another white gentlemen who did not have any political experience at all, a local businessperson.  And he and I ended up in the runoff.  The incumbent didn't end up in the runoff.  I needed ninety-, I think it was ninety-seven votes to win without a runoff.  In the runoff I won by twenty-one votes.  So you can see--you don't have to be a rocket scientist to see exactly what happened there.  It turned out to be a total race-supported election with me getting more white votes than he got black votes.  But it just became a racial divide thing, and it never should have been that way.  And that's, if I had one, one of my greatest disappointments in being in politics, that's probably more disappoint-, disappointing than the, the losses I've had because it never should have been that way especially in the runoff because this young man, although he's a nice young guy and all that, but had no experience to come to the table against a person with my background and experience, which has been a successful political experience.  And everybody here knows that.  And the race come down to, to twenty-one, to twenty-one votes.  It was quite disappointing.
Story_ID: 7949
Speaker 1: So, when you start your, you start your, your term in office [as mayor of Milledgeville, Georgia, in 2001] really on a, a, not a--but with the fact that this was sort of a racially divisive campaign--so how have you been able to deal with that thing?  You know, because, you know, that, that happened actually in our town of Chicago, you know, and it, it sets a tone for the town, you know.
Speaker 2: It does sets, it's, it d-, it does set a tone.  But what I did, once again, I put all of that behind me.  I, I, you know, I, you can't forget it and all that, but you don't dwell on it.  See, I ran on an agenda.  I had a pledge.  I just didn't run for office like a lot of people do and especially at this level and et cetera.  They really were running on things other than a real platform.  And I had a pretty well laid out platform, so that's what I came in and implemented.  Plus, we had something that hadn't happened here for a new mayor in, in modern times even if it ever happened.  I had the weekend--I was sworn in on, on New Year's Eve, which was on a Monday.  That Sunday I had an ecumenical service at, at it's Central State Hospital here in the Chapel of All Faith.  It holds about four or five hundred people.  But I, I asked the, the Mini-, Ministerial Alliance here, which is an integrated type an organization, to sponsor that for us.  And, and that place was packed.  There was standing room only, black and white.  And then that Monday afternoon we had an inaugural ceremony, where the mayor and council was sworn in publicly.  That hadn't happened before.  The mayor and council generally came up here on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day, in the council room with their family and whomever they wanted, and they were sworn in and, and went home.  It was, it was no pomp and circumstances behind it.  So what I tried to do and what we tried to do since I've been in office is bring the, the citizens into, into our administration.  I've had a dialogue night--I promised to have a dialogue night, something like a public town hall meeting.  We had our first one about a month after I'd been in office.  It was televised, at least it was tape-delayed.  But we do have a public service-type TV station here.  And our council meetings are, are televised live.  And I started doing some things there.  I have a--in the past one of the council people would say the prayer and, and for a number of years there was a minister on there and he would do that.  Well, I stopped that.  I start having a local minister to come in and give that prayer.  And I brought the first one in and after that I have each one of the council people to select one for a month.  And I also have a student from the public school system, or any way the school would like to do it, to come in and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.  And that really has taken off.  We've had color guards to come in from the, the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] program.  We've had--what do you call these school crossing kids--I forget what they're called.  Patrol--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Crossing guard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we've had them to come in as a group.  And, and that really has--it's trying to, you know, get the young people involved.  I have probably on the average since I've been in office, on the average made at least two speeches a week somewhere in this area or in middle Georgia, or attended events.  So I have just been on the go around the clock and especially during the Martin Luther King [Jr.], you know, period and then during February, Black History Month.  But all of those speaking engagements are, or appearances, have not been African American oriented.  Most--a lot of them have because of the months and things that were going on.  But I, I'm constantly on the move.
Speaker 1: You know, you know, I want--so you're, you're feeling positive about your time in office in your--it's a different thing being mayor than it was state senator.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yes, it's a difference.  You know, a state senator or a legislator in most cases they don't manage any money, they don't have anyone that works for them, and they're there for one, basically, one purpose, and that's to make policy.  And I'm not criticizing that.  I've been there and it's a very, you know, they play a very--.
Speaker 1: (Black screen.)
Speaker 2: (Videographer:)  We dropped out.  Just a second.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: But a mayor, you know, gets involved in all of those things.  You know, I have a work force.  I have a budget I have to deal with.  I have to present a vision to, to the community.  And in this community I need to be an ambassador for the whole community.  And it's, it's a totally different ballgame.

Speaker 1: Now, I want to talk a little bit about the heritage of Milledgeville [Georgia], you know, what--where this--what's important about or significant about this community.  And then I want to move to talk about your family business (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, Milledgeville was established in 1803.  Next year, 2003, we will celebrate the bicentennial, two hundred years of its establishment.  Milledgeville is also the only city other than Washington, DC, that was established and designed to be a capital city.  I don't think you'll--you won't find any other city that was set up under those premises.  I think in most cites their capital moved around in, a number of times before--well, in Georgia also.  But this one was set up to be a [state] capital city.  The significance, the present significance is that the old capitol building facility is still here and Georgia Military College is located on that campus.  The old governor's mansion is still here and it's located on the Georgia College and State University, which is the, the only liberal, state liberal arts university in Georgia.  And, Milledgeville is significant from the other state institutions we have here.  We have a youth development campus for the youth delinquents people.  And we have a war veterans' home here, a mental institutional, Central State Hospital, and several prison complexes.  And recently opened a war veterans' cemetery, a national cemetery.  And it's also looked at as the an-, antebellum capital of Georgia because of a number of the old antebellum-type homes that are still in existence.
Speaker 1: Now, the black community here--what is its history and sort of form here, you know, what--it goes back also a long time, too.
Speaker 2: It, it, it goes back a long time.  It goes back to early during those years of establishment.  The black history here is probably like a lot of other places.  It's more oral than, than in writing.  And, and that is something that's being worked on now by a group of, of the black and whites, trying to capture the black history in Milledgeville by talking to people like Miss. Rose and capturing that, that oral history and talking to people like my father [Floyd L. Griffin, Sr.], who has a tremendous memory of history here in Milledgeville.  Flagg Chapel Baptist Church is named after a black person who was a, a freed slave and did a lot of significant things here in Milledgeville, working at the old capitol, the mansion.  I think he was a blacksmith and, and had some other, other type businesses.  A black person helped save the capitol once when it was, when it was being burnt, when it was on fire.  And he went up on the top of the capitol and, and did some very heroic-type things.  And, and because of that the Georgia General Assembly gave him his freedom.  And a part of our downtown area--not anymore--was a significant piece of the black community when I was growing up.  Like a lot of other small towns and even large towns like Atlanta, you know, they had significant black streets like Auburn Avenue and, and at that time Hunter Street, which is MLK [Martin Luther King] now.

Speaker 1: ...I raised and spent about hundred and sixty thousand dollars.  Not--before then, a lieutenant governor's race probably cost about two hundred fifty, three hundred thousand, but we had, we went--the guy that's lieutenant governor now is a millionaire and et cetera and he went out and raised a bunch of money and put his money in there.  But I spent a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or hundred and sixty thousand, and he spent probably a couple of million dollars.  And at the end of the day the difference between his vote and my vote was thirty-eight thousand votes.  Now if you take that and you swing vote it--in politics, you know, I take away from him, then you're talking about half of that.  You're talking about fifteen or sixteen thousand votes was the difference if I could have raised say another fifty or sixty thousand dollars to get on TV or do a, a couple of key things to make sure that, number one, African Americans knew that there was a African American running.  On top of that I came in number one--with just that amount of money--I came in number one in about twenty-two or twenty-three counties to include Macon and Bibb County, which is one of your largest counties, Chatham County, which is Savannah, in, in the Atlanta metropolitan area, Fulton and DeKalb County are your lar-, largest counties in the state.  I came in number two there and not to him.  He came in number three.  So, the timing was right.  We just didn't, couldn't get our people--once again, you know, that "Willie Lynch syndrome" and the crab mentality--that's what I really want to say, you know.  You know about the crab m-, the--.
Speaker 2: (Um-hmm?) (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, it's, it's alive.  It's still alive in America.  It's alive in Georgia.

Speaker 1: I want to talk about the, the funeral home business.  A lot of people say if you're in, in that business you sort of have a eye on the whole community.  But I want to talk about, you know, the history of Slater Funeral Home in this community and that, you know, what significance it's had.
Speaker 2: Well, Slater's Funeral Home has, has been around over ninety-five years.  It's one of the oldest funeral homes in, in middle Georgia.  It's the second oldest funeral home here in Milledgeville [Georgia] next to the White Funeral Home, which has only been around two or three years longer than, than Slater's.  It was owned by the Slater's family up until 1966, I think, when my family purchased it along with another gentleman who died later on, Mr. Joseph Graham, person I talked about earlier who was the principal of the school.  And the, really the funeral home had gone down to almost nothing, and my, my mother [Ruth Evans Griffin] and father [Floyd L. Griffin, Sr.], along with the, the limited staff they had at that time worked very hard over the years and built it back to where it is presently today, which is, you know, a very solid business.  And funeral homes, especially in small communities, in communities the size of Milledgeville, is a very, very important, plays a very important piece especially in the black community.  It's not too many major quote unquote black businesses in a community.  You know, you still have your barbershops and your beauty shops and a few mom and pops, corner stores and et cetera.  But you don't have a lot of black businesses in, in communities like this, and we need to, you know, to work on that.  And, funeral homes play a very important piece in the community.
Speaker 1: What do you thing people would be surprised about the funeral home business that they, you know, might not think about?
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of people think there's a lot of money in the funeral business.  A lot of money come in and go out because it's the type of business that it--takes a lot to just operate it, you know, buying caskets and doing the, buying embalming fluids, and doing the embalming and, and then it's, you know, personnel driven.  And it's just not as much profit in the funeral business as a lot of people think.  And I, you know, I think people would be surprised.  And those individuals try to go in the funeral business, I think they are surprised to realize that it takes time to establish a funeral business.  You just don't walk into a community and especially small communities and even in some of your larger cities and start up a business and think that overnight you're gonna end up being successful.  You have to work at it.  And it's still in the, in the black community and, and smaller communities and medium-size communities--people, and not only black people but even white people, you know, they pretty much associate themselves with a funeral home and that family generally stays with that funeral home and something really bad has to happen for them to walk away from not serving, having that funeral home to provide their service.

Speaker 1: Your boots--.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You're known for your cowboy--and I keep saying I'm going to ask this question, but you're known for your cowboy boots.  And can you talk about them?  Those are some very ni-, nice boots you've got on today.  But, you know, I had heard, you know, I had read, actually, about your whole, your legendary cowb-, cowboy boots.  So how did, how did that tradition get started?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's one of those things just, it just gets started.  When I was in the military, when I was stationed in Germany, I bought a pair of cowboy boots.  And it, and it was really for a special function that I a part of.  And I used to wear them off and on, you know, when I wore civilian clothes, but not that often.  And, and when I got out of the Army, I s-, I don't know, I just start wearing that pair of cowboy boots and, and I liked wearing the boots.  So I bought me another pair of boots.  And then people start commenting on the cowboy boots.  So when I didn't wear the cowboy boots, they was asking me, where are the cowboy boots?  So, I got tired of people asking me about the cowboy boots, and I just started wearing them--you know, I just start wearing them.  And, and I like them and 99 percent of the time I wear the western boots or cowboy boots, whatever you want to call them.  And sometime during the summer when it gets very hot, I'll wear some low quarters, but just wear the cowboy boots most of the time.  And it has become a, a part of my persona, I guess, as--when I was--I'll tell you something else:  When I was in the military, it's, it's weird how things get started.  I used to chew on a cigar all the time.  And the way that got started is that one, one of my soldier's wife had a baby, you know, and that's, and it was a boy.  And, and especially in the military that happens, if it's a boy, you give out cigars.  So, for some reason I took the cigar and just stuck it in my mouth and was chewing on it.  And I probably did that for a couple days or so.  And for some reason I lit the cigar one day when I was really kind of upset.  So, soldiers, you know, they can, they, they keep an eye on you.  So they know everything that go down.  So the word got out that--and I was a major then--so when Major Griffin gets upset, he lights his cigar; other than that, he chews his cigar.  So, whenever they saw me without a cigar, they would worry me to death--where is your cigar?  Where--?  So I just start carrying a cigar all the time.  Never lit it, very seldom.  And I'd just chew on it.  So for years, no matter where I went in the Army, it became a, one of those things.  It kind of followed my reputation, followed me around the Army with my cigar.  So now the boots follow me around (laughter).

Speaker 1: Now what are your hopes or concerns about the black community?
Speaker 2: My concerns about the black community is that we have gotten too comfortable.  We have two and three cars in the garage, Mercedes, BMW, and a Corvette, which I have (laughter), but they are old.  We have, we have this nice ranch-style home--I guess that's not in vogue now, but, you know, the two stories and all of that.  We, we are making some pretty good money--middle class or upper middle class.  We are not involved in the community the way we should be in giving back, volunteer-, volunteering.  We don't go to church anymore, on a whole.  We are in the fast lane.  (Pause) We don't like each other--like we used to.  And, I think that if we con-, you know, continue to do those kinds of things that we're in, we're in trouble in the future.  I think we've come a long ways even in my lifetime.  But we are somewhat at a standstill now, in my opinion.  My hopes are that we can recover from some of those things before it's too late.  I think we can.  I think we can refocus.  I think we have some of the leadership out there.  I think we are in a, still in a transitional period of the civil rights leaders to a more modern, different thinking leader in the extent of, of where we are today.  And that's--I'm not criticizing the, the civil rights leadership at all because, you know, they're going by the wayside, anyway.  And they made a tremendous impact.  And the ones that are around, like Dr. Joe [Joseph] Lowery, who's a very good friend of mine, who's just supportive in, in my lieutenant governor's race and my race for mayor and all of that.  Those people are invaluable, and we still need them.  But at the same time, we need to continue to have the Andy [Andrew] Youngs of the world and the John Lewis of the world and, and Joe [Joseph] Lowery of the world, and those kind of people still out there trying to help us groom new, new leadership to think at the next, at the next level.  And positioning ourselves to take over the major leadership of this country--you know, here we are in 2002 and we do not have an African American U.S. senator, you know.  But I read the paper, and I look at where the emphasis is, is on having and getting white women into the U.S. Senate, but where is the emphasis on getting black males into the U.S. Senate.  We have not had a serious move to have a black vice president.  We do not have a black governor in these United States since Douglas Wilder.  You know, politics plays an extremely important role of who we are and what we're all about and what we're going to be.  And we need to be in the arena to help structure strategically this country and, and African Americans.  You know, I have found that most blacks, when they get in those positions, attempt to make life better for everyone, not just for the black community, for everyone.  And that's why we need to, we need to start focusing more on, on those kinds of things.  And that's why we got to start not letting someone else tell us when it's time to do something.  We have some very bright people in this country.  We always have.  We have more now than we had thirty or forty years ago.  And the opportunities are out there.  But we got to do it collectively.  We gotta go for it.

Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I want my legacy to be that I tried to give something back to my community, to the state, and to the nation because I've been very blessed in my fifty-seven years up to now.  And, I just want to give back.  And I want to help.  And I want to make things better for my children and especially my grandchildren and for the other ch-, children of the c-, of this world, excuse me-- of this country.
Speaker 1: And, what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Being a kind person, giving, concerned, want to make some positive change, want to continue to move to the next level and have people around me and, to move to the next level.
