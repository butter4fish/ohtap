 Lemons  Cully  Do you want to state your name and when and where you were born?  Lelah Jones Howe Cully, I was born on 8  August  15, 1917, five miles  northwest of Arnett, Oklahoma.  I   m Anne Cole, and I was born in Ellis County in the first month, third day of     27. But my maiden name was Richardson if you need that.  And we got a copy of your questions that you had filled out so, double duty  here.  Talking to Stella Lalicker  And you get to be number three.  Stella Lalicker. What else is it you want?  Your birthday and where you were born.  Oh, I was born in 1915 on 25 Mile Creek in 1915.  So you   re all locals?  Yes, we lived through it, we   re still here  (Laughs)  We   re the hardy ones too.  Well we   ll just kind of start and let you just talk about um what a typical day  was like for you. You don   t have to start with dust bowl stuff necessarily, just  your typical day in the 1930s. If there was such a thing.  Well we got up pretty early, I mean most of us up between 5:00 and 6:00, had  breakfast, which was a full breakfast in those days. I can remember, back when  my father was still living, that we had fried chicken and gravy and biscuits and  I believe fried potatoes. The one thing that I can remember about my father,  Mother always took the brains out of the head of the chicken and fried it, and I  was sitting in this high chair and my father was going to open that up for me to  eat the brains and I didn   t want him to. He jerked me up and took me in the  bedroom and paddled me and I didn   t get my brains that day. Then there was  the chores to do, there was milking to do, chickens to take care of. We had  hogs and the horses to feed and the men went to the field. And in the summer,  there was garden work to do, plenty of garden work.  5  Kite  Cole  That   s all.  Well mine was about the same, we   d get up early and it was my job to go get  the horses in and they   d always be at the end of the pasture about a mile and a  half away, didn   t fail. I wasn   t a very big kid but anyway I was really scared.  I   d go out there by myself and there   d always be a coyote or something and I  was kind of leery of getting them in. But that was my job, get them horses in. I  had two older sisters and they   d be helping Mom get the breakfast and an older  brother that helped Dad with the milking and whenever they got the chores  done, then we   d have our breakfast. And like Lelah said, we had biscuits and  gravy and potatoes and pork chops or something like that, huge breakfast and  cereal with pure cream. I always ate cereal with pure cream. Now, if I   d eat it,  it would make me sick. (Laughs)  Then we   d have to do chores around the house. I   d have to help wash the  separator. It had 14 eleven million disks, it seemed like (Laughter) and I   d  have to go out there and wash that old separator every morning. Now at night  they   d just run some hot water through it, but in the morning, I   d have to wash  that separator. It was always my job to dust and during the dust bowl days, the  old windows would be so full of dust that we   d have to take a little whisk  broom and sweep it out. My older sisters would take the curtains down. This  was if we had a nice, sunshiny, calm day and then they   d take the curtains  down and shake them. Shoot my curtains could be hanging in my house  nowadays for three years and I wouldn   t get near the dust out of them   (Laughter) But anyway then when I swept out all we could get, I   d get a wet a  rag and wash it cause we didn   t have electricity, no vacuum cleaners or  nothing like that. And my mother had an organ. It had about a million curly  cues around it, and I   d dust and I   d dust. I   d dust on that thing and my older  sister would come by,    You didn   t get that off, do it again.    (Laughs) And I  hated that thing cause I just couldn   t ever get the dust all off of it.  Then of course the folks would go to, I mean Dad and brother, and sometimes  me, I had to go to the field and chop weeds along with my brothers. My little  brother, he   d bring us a drink and maybe a sandwich in the middle of the  morning, say ten o   clock, and then we   d go into the house and eat dinner. In  the afternoon maybe they   d bring us lemonade or something with a sandwich  and we   d have this big meal at night and it   d be dark before you went to bed  and boy you got up at daylight.  I helped feed the chickens and gather the eggs when I got big enough, gather  the eggs without breaking them cause they were really important. Now we  wouldn   t get to eat an egg but maybe once a week, cause that was a treat to get  to eat an egg, because we took the eggs and the cream to town and sold them  and that   s what bought our groceries was with the cream and egg money. We  had an old Model-T but when the dust bowl hit, something happened and it  wouldn   t run and then we didn   t have any transportation. My dad would go  with one of the neighbors, he   d pay him something and he   d go with the cream  and eggs to town and buy the groceries. He   d always bring us kids a little sack  of Red Hots home and the oldest brother would get them, he   d divide them up,  one for you and one for you and one for you, there   s five of us children and  6  Lemons  Cole  Lemons  Lalicker  Cole  then he   d say    I   m the biggest, I need two.    So he   d take two, one, one, one,  one, one and then pretty soon he   d need two more. He always ended up with  more candy and nobody ever said a thing just because he was bigger and he  needed more. (Laughter) But we played out in the yard, we made our own  toys, we didn   t have many toys. We   d take some old, rusty nails if we could  find them and pound them down in the ground and take some twine and tie  them around and that would be our fence, and maybe we   d have corn cobs for  the horses and a rock for a chicken and you know we   d make our farm.  Play farm.  Yeah, we   d make our farm and play with that. We had a lot of fun, we didn   t  know we were deprived or hard up, we just had fun.  Does that sound familiar for you?  Part of it.  Of course, we didn   t have any electricity and we   d have to take our milk and  our butter down to the cellar and put it down on the floor because that   s the  coolest place there was to keep it. Then every meal, we   d have to go down  there and get it and bring it back up and then take it back down when we got  through. I remember, of course I don   t know whether Jell-O was just new then  but it was new to us. Oh that was a great thing, Jell-O, but we couldn   t make it  in the summertime cause it wouldn   t get cold enough. So we   d have Jell-O in  the wintertime once in awhile and we had dessert once a week. We had dessert  on Sunday, but during the week we couldn   t afford dessert.  I remember when that big dust storm come in, we had gone over to the  neighbors and they had a pretty good-sized house and me and their little boy,  he was a year younger than I was, we were setting out there on the porch on  the south side of the porch, all these birds were going by, man, all these birds.  We went in the house, hollered at the folks,    The birds are just going south,  just birds everywhere  We   ve never seen so many birds     Well then they come  out and that dust storm was just almost on us, and they said,    Well run to the  cellar, run to the cellar     So this little kid he was just a year younger than I and  he got scared and he took running off and I run off after him and caught him  and brought him back cause he was just panicked he just was running. He went  past the cave and was just still going  (Laughs) And of course we thought the  world was coming to and end or something, but it was a beautiful day that day  and the folks had left the windows up. The doors were open and whenever it  past and we went back home, we had to shake the bedding. It was just dirt, and  we had to shake the bedding before we could even go to bed and try to clean  up that dirt. You   d just get the house cleaned up and here it was again, do it  again, do it again.  I didn   t have the worries that the folks did cause I was a kid but, one time  during this period, I don   t know how much the government was paying for the  cows, but see there wasn   t enough food for the cows or the horses or nothing.  They came through and they designated a farm and one they designated was  7  Lemons  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Lemons  Cully  about three and a half miles from where I lived. My dad picked out three or  four old cows and drove them up there and they killed them, they slaughtered  them. I don   t know, I think they took these cattle and put them somewhere else  and they ate them somewhere, but I know when he picked them cows out, I  just cried to think that they had to walk three miles and then they were going to  be killed.  Yeah, do you remember that, the killing of cattle?  Yes, yes.  Did you have a similar reaction?  Well I don   t think we had to have any killed, but I know some of the neighbors  did. My father   of course he died in    27   he died before the dust storm days  come along but he raised Galloway cattle. So we had cattle and had just a little  money that we could get by with. We wasn   t quite as desperate as some of  them, but yes, I remember when they killed the cattle and this New Deal that  come along helped some of the farmers and ranchers to stay in business  because you know some of them were going to have to quit, I will tell you.  Well I can tell some more.  Well go ahead     No just go all around, it   s okay.  I want to tell them about the dirty Sunday, I remember that vividly. Go ahead  with yours.  The government had some other kind of a deal. They had CC camp for boys,  but my older brother he didn   t go to that because he had to stay home and help  work, but my oldest sister went to a thing at Woodward and I don   t remember  what they called it, but she sewed. That   s what they had in there for them.  They sewed gowns and stuff for like Fort Supply and there was an insane  asylum and I don   t know what all, but she would go up there on Mondays and  stay    til Friday and oh, I don   t know, she might have got a dollar a day or  something doing it but she got her food and that was real important because  she got her food during the week. I lost my train of thought.  Go ahead and tell your Black Sunday story then.  My husband   s folks lived two miles east of where I lived. We married in    33; I  was still going to high school. This particular day, Sunday, we couldn   t go  straight through because the road had been closed, so we had to go down  Highway 60. The house is a mile and a half north and a fourth west of  Highway 60 and we had to go around, and then they lived half a mile north  two miles east. Well we were over there that day and we could see something  coming up back there. Of course we   d had dust storms before, dust would  blow, but oh, nothing like that. We had an old,    35 Ford Coup and when we  8  Lemons  Lalicker  Cully  Lemons  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  Cole  Lemons  come off the highway we had to kind of go down hill. Oh, that thing was  black, and of course as she says every debris, flower, or birds and thistles and  what all was ahead of it. Well when we got down to the bottom of this hill he  had to stop, and it got so dark, I had on a white skirt and he couldn   t even see  me in there. I don   t know, it lasted seemed like an eternity but it must have  lasted 15 to 20 minutes. Of course you can   t tell, but anyway when it finally  lightened up so we could see where we were driving. We went on home and at  the time we were living with my mother. Well she was out trying to get the  chickens in. Oh it was dusty, of course, she had the house shut up so the house  wasn   t as dirty as it could have been had it been opened, but that   s the one  thing that I remember about that Sunday. Oh I never saw anything like it, and  that is a very good picture of it.  What do you remember about Black Sunday?  Oh, I don   t know.  You don   t know?  Is that picture the kind of thing that   ?  Yeah.  Wherever you were?  Yeah, just a black cloud rolled in and when it did it put the dirt in the house  just like it did outside.  Did you get stuck having to having to clean all that out, all that dirt that was in  your house.  Oh sure, sure you had to clean all that up, but when it was coming in, I was  just flabbergasted. I was just watching to see what was going to happen next. I  never was scared.  Where you in your house when Black Sunday hit?  Yes.  And did you stay in the house or did you guys go to a storm cellar?  Oh no, we had to go see about the cattle and stuff like that, and we   d just go  one way and see if all the cattle was in the pasture and stuff and then go on and  see about the horses and stuff like that and then on to your next job if you  could get the dirt out of your eyes and stuff long enough to see it.  I know the wind was horrible. I don   t have any idea, but it was really, really  strong.  In addition to the black cloud, is that what made it different? Was it windier  9  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Kite  Cole  Lemons  Cully  Lalicker  than it was during these previous storms?  Well it was a beautiful day. Just as calm as it is outside today when we went  over to our neighbors. There just wasn   t any wind, it was just a beautiful day.  But see this originated, so I   ve been told, in the Dakotas, and it   s oily, that soil,  and the electricity that it generated. That soil had oil in it that   s the reason it  stuck so, so hard.  Cause it was really hard to get off.  Yeah, I had an aunt lived up in Colorado and it   s worse up there than it was  down here, and I can remember when we went up there that oh, they had sand  banks like we have snow banks and it oh it was so much worse, it just swept  everything. The fences, most of the wires were down, a lot of them were taken  down to cross. Now we didn   t have it like that here, but that was back in  Colorado. That dirt storm that come that was so bad they said came from the  Dakotas and Nebraska, came and it picked up the dirt all the way along, and  we didn   t have communication then to tell you something was coming.  I don   t think we even had a radio or a telephone.  Oh, we had a telephone; we had a telephone from way back.  We didn   t have no electricity or nothing, we just lived on the farm  No electricity, nope.  And raised what you ate mostly and when the drought came, you couldn   t raise  anything. My mother canned, oh she   d have 400 or 500 quarts of stuff in the  cellar when fall came.  What kind of things was she canning?  Greens. Lamb   s quarter is one thing. I remember we   d have to go out and pick  that Lamb   s quarter.  Yeah, I didn   t know you could can that.  By the tub fulls.  What is it?  It   s a weed, its green, wild.  It   s sort of like spinach  Kind of wild but it grows on the creek.  I remember it called Pigweed, somebody called it.  10  Cully  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Lemons  Lalicker  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Kite  Lemons  No cultivating, it just grows and it was good to eat.  And there were mulberries   trees there and they always had mulberries and  we   d pick them mulberries and can them. She   d make cobblers out of  mulberries and pies. She   d usually put some other fruit with them or  something. I   ve looked back on that and I don   t know how in the world my  mother did all that work. She did have a gas-powered washing machine that  her father bought when my youngest brother was born so she didn   t have to  wash on the board anymore and had an old Maytag gas washing machine.  That doesn   t sound very safe  (Laughing)  Well it worked, never did blow up but it had the little old motor or something  down there that you had a gas thing on it. You fill this full of gas and pull the  rope or something; seemed like you had to pull a rope to get it started.  Do you have a gas washing machine?  No.  My dad would always start it. We   d wash, she   d put a big old boiler, double  boiler, great big old double boiler on and get the water real hot and put that in  there and then she put more water back on. Of course we had to haul it from  the well, pour it in there, and she boiled all the white clothes to get them clean.  Well here   s where I was born and raised  showing photograph . My father  settled there in 1893. This is a dug out down here and that dugout didn   t get  near as dirty as this house did, because it was down     It went over it.  Yeah, it went over it, but anyway, there was a well he dug and we had to carry  water up that hill to the house until 1924 or 1925. He had a fellow come and  dig a well, cause I remember witching   took forked limbs, peach limbs and  hold them and when you walk over a certain place where water was, that thing  would just turn down. It never would turn for me but it did for him because  that   s where he dug the well     There   s water.  That   s where that thing would turn over and then   see that was in    25,    24. In     25 they piped water into the house and we had water in the house. Of course,  not hot water but cold water, and then after he passed away in    27 my mother  bought a Maytag gasoline powered washing machine.  Was there any other kind? Was there any other brand of washing machine?  Than Maytag?  11  Cully  Lalicker  Cully  Lemons  Kite  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Kite  Cully  Lemons  Kite  Cully  Kite  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Kite  Cully  I don   t know, I   m sure there was but I don   t remember.  I don   t remember; my mother had that.  I don   t either, Maytag what my mother had was a Maytag and boy were we     I can see somebody inside the house, is that you in there?  Let me look. I didn   t see this.  I don   t, it probably could be. I don   t know, it probably is.  Can you see it?  No, I don   t think it   s me.  It looks like a little brat. (Laughter)  Well it could have been me. (Laughter) I don   t remember.  I think it was  (Laughter)  I think that maybe a couple of people are peeking their heads out. How funny.  I can   t, well I don   t know, anyway. That   s the only picture I   ve got of that  dugout of which I am very sorry that I didn   t take more pictures of it, cause it  was something. He was the first person between Higgins, Texas and Arnett,  Oklahoma, that was called    the flats.    He was born and raised around San  Angelo, Texas, and when he reached two, I think he was the oldest of seven  children, he took his horse and his colt gun and come north to Higgins, Texas,  and went to work on a ranch out there, and during that, that was in    85. And  during that time, he was looking for a place with live water, that   s the water of  creek and springs, and in 1893 this is where he settled. That   s Red Bluff  Creek. Red Bluff Creek starts about a mile north of where this house is and it  runs down and of course runs into the Canadian River, and to this day, they  don   t have to have windmills to produce water for the cattle.  He picked a good place.  Yes he did, and I still have it.  Peach tree branches were right.  I got it in the    100-year deal    back in    94.  What   s the    hundred year deal   ?  It   s farms that have been in the same family for a hundred years that is at least  40 acres and produces over a 1,000 dollars a year.  12  Kite  Cully  Kite  Cully  Kite  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Are they called Centennial Farms?  Yes.  And what do you get for having that?  You get honorable mention, you get plaques, certificates or whatever you want  to call them and also if you have buildings that are 50 years old and are still  usable, you get them in there too. So I had those, I   ve got pictures at home of  all that but I didn   t think you folks would be interested in that.  Yeah, that would have been great.  We   re interested in lots of stuff.  Yes, you have to prove, I had nothing, I started from scratch. I didn   t have the  patent, I didn   t have the dates and I thought he came there in September of    93   1893  but it was in January the first of    94  1894 . I had to write Washington  D.C., the archives to get all those dates. On September the 16th when they  opened this country up for settlement, they had land offices, one was in  Woodward, one was in Alva, one was in Kingfisher, one was in Perry and one  was in Enid. Had I went to Kingfisher, I probably could have found out all that  because the papers, the copies that I got were dated January the first, in 1894  in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. I had to send to Santa Fe, New Mexico for the copy  of the patent, and when you get all that together and prove to them that it was  authentic, it took me two years but I made it. There are several farms in  Oklahoma, I think there   s   I believe the last I had a count, it was 280-  something, so many of them. We   ve got one right out west here, the Barr  Farm, it   s still there. They were at our place several years ago, before    94 and I  was telling them about that so and I give them all the information of where to  find stuff, and sure enough they finally come out with it  .  Well my Dad come out here and homesteaded in 1902, next year if Virgil  wants to, he could get that     It   d be your turn.  He still lives on it?  My oldest brother. Oh no, he owns it. No, he lives in Woodward.  Okay yeah, but if he owns it and you see     I don   t think there   s any of the old buildings that   s fit to live in anymore, I  think they   re all but, he owns the farm.  Well there   s those buildings, one of them was a shop of which was still usable,  one of them was a barn of which they let cattle go in, one of them was a shed  of which was stored this, that and the other, and let   s see what   and the house,  that was the fourth building. I have encouraged so many people to do that.  13  Kite  Cully  Cole  Cully  Kite  Lalicker  Cully  Kite  Lalicker  Kite  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  Kite  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  You   re the spokesperson for the Centennial farms.  Well I tried, but I haven   t   there   s the Word Ranch down south of Arnett, it   s  over, gosh, it   s over a hundred years old, it must be 105 and I told that son,  grandson, all the original one   s are gone, it   s just the grandkids, and his wife  said,    Yeah I   ll get with that, I   ll get with that.     But they never did anything.  No, he passed away. Charles passed away here a couple years ago and they  haven   t done anything with it.  Mrs. Lalicker, how did you end up in this area, in Oklahoma, in Gage?  Well, I was born there.  Born out on Twenty-five Mile in a log house.  Where did your parents come from?  Well they came from over by Enid.  They were already in Oklahoma?  My father died when I was less than a year old. My mother raised six kids.  Did she, on a farm?  Yes.  Wow, what a woman, with six kids on a farm. What were your daily chores,  what was something that was just your job to do on the farm?  Gee, I don   t know.  You didn   t get stuck washing dishes all the time or tending cattle all the time?  Washing dishes would have been easy but we had to take care of hogs and  cows and horses and everything else.  Did your mom ever remarry?  No.  Wow, I can   t imagine. That seems like maybe it would have been kind of odd  that she didn   t remarry but I would think that most women in that situation  probably would have.  I don   t think she had time. (Laughter)  14  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Cully  She   s probably right.  Maybe.  She   s probably right.  Would you guys remember when you were little what kind of toys or what kind  of games, what you did for fun when you were kids?  Oh, let   s see.  We played store, and if Mom would ever get a can of anything from the town  we   d just beg her to open it on the bottom side so that we could use that empty  can in our store. I mean you just didn   t buy stuff because it was out on a farm  and we ate what we raised, and of course once in awhile they   d buy something.  One of the things that she would buy was pineapple and pork and beans and  we had pineapple and pork and beans in our store for sale (Laughs) and we just  pretended. We   d play with rocks and we   d always get one present at Christmas  time, one thing and it wouldn   t be expensive but we always had one thing at  Christmas time. We really looked forward to Christmas and what we had we  took care of. I always had an old cat, I always had an old cat and I   d play with  them and dress them up  (Laughter)  Is there any particular Christmas or birthday that really stands out from when  you were little?  Well one Christmas I slept in the front room, and my bed was here and then  the sewing machine was there and it was right in front of a window. It was a  real moonlit night and I woke up in the night and I could see the Christmas  tree, cause it was on the sewing machine, course it was just a little tree and I  laid there for a long time and I thought well there   s presents under that tree,  but I was afraid if I   d get up and look I   d wake the folks up, but I did. I slipped  out on my bed and crawled down and got a look under there, and there was a  grape basket. They used to come in long baskets and they had a handle over  them, and my mother had covered that, put some material in that and there was  a little rubber doll about this big laying in there and I saw that I said, to myself,     Oh I hope that   s mine, I hope that   s mine     Sure enough it was.  Well my most remembered Christmas, of course I was alone, I was raised  alone, I had two brothers but they was 12 and 13 years older than I was and  they left home. Oh they were in high school and them and their daddy didn   t  get along so they left home. So it was just me, and I would get a doll. Course I  always liked dolls, and I would get a doll probably at Christmas.  When I started to school I was seven years old before I started, the school  where I was going to go in our district was all boys, and my daddy had decided  I wasn   t going to school with all those boys. So there was another country  school three miles from there that was called the Beum School, the little red  school house now is all     15  Lemons  Cully  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Lalicker  Lemons  Cully  Lemons  Cully  We saw that today.  Okay, that   s where I got my first six years of education. I rode a horse, it was  three miles, course I didn   t go round the road, I went up through the field and  cut through the pastures and I know this particular Christmas, oh it was cold.  My dad dressed me up and put me on the back of his saddle horse and we  went. And so this Christmas I think I was in the program anyway, there were  two or three of the most beautiful dolls you ever saw, big dolls, and every time  they   d call one,    Oh is that mine, is that mine?    (Laughter) No, not mine.  Well, I didn   t get mine until the next morning and it was just about that tall,  but it was a doll. Then blocks, I played with blocks and I   d make pens and put,  I don   t know what I used for the cattle and horses and all but anyway, and  marbles. Oh we shot marbles for, you wouldn   t believe. Well that was my  games.  Did you ever play jacks?  Well after I got bigger in school.  Yes, yes.  Big enough to come to a town school, I was in the fifth grade, then we had  jacks and I always wanted a pair of skates, and I just couldn   t understand why  I couldn   t ever have a pair of skates, but we didn   t have any place to skate all  the way out there in the country cause that   s a little old cement thing out in  front of the door wouldn   t be as big as this table. (Laughter)  We lived in the sand. All you had to do is take one step and you were already  under the sand.  I guess you didn   t want any roller skates then (Laughter) more like snowshoes  or something to stay on top of the sand   Well I rode a horse to school, went six years. After my daddy died I still went  to Beum, but 7th and 8th grade I went to the school in the district and that was  one, two, that was about two and a half miles, and I rode a horse to there. Well  then when it came for high school, it was five miles to Arnett, no bus. We had  a car but I wasn   t to drive it. So I rode a horse to Arnett for one year, and then  they started running busses and then I had to walk over a mile to the highway  to catch them.  Did you ever play with other kids from town or from school that would come  over?  We had a neighbor. There was a neighbor that lived two miles west of us and  she went to Beum when I did. Well we got to play and she   d come down and  play with me and I   d go up and play with her. Of course I had a horse, I always  had a horse cause my daddy was a rancher, and so I always, always had a  horse so, if nothing else I   d go get my horse and just ride it.  16  Cole  Cully  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Lemons  Lalicker  Cully  Cole  Lalicker  Cole  Cully  Lalicker  Cully  One thing I remember is we really had to clean up our plates.  Oh yes, definitely   You didn   t leave any food on your plates and the first thing that was passed  around was bread and everybody took a slice of bread. You ate that bread with  your meal, and if you took too much, you sat there    til you ate it. You didn   t,  so you learned that now you could always have seconds if there was anything  left but if you took too much    One time we had some molasses and of course  we always churned our own butter and I had mixed up this molasses with  butter and had some cornbread, my mother had baked cornbread, so I ate a  piece of it and I wanted some more. She said    Are you sure you can eat it?        Oh yes, I   m still real hungry.    Well I fixed a big old plate of it, well of course  that didn   t take too long to get full and I sat there probably    til four o   clock in  the afternoon. (Laughter) before I got that ate, but that was one thing, you  cleaned up your plate.  So will you eat cornbread and molasses now?  Well yes, I still like it.  I know some people tell a story say,    I   m not ever eating that again.     Well I don   t think I ate it at that time for quite a while but I like it now.  What was your favorite food treat, something like maybe you would get when  company was coming or if there was you know a special occasion something  you didn   t get to have usually what was your favorite thing, you really looked  forward to having that?  When they came to visit, fried chicken.  Yes, fried chicken was one we always had.  Yeah, we always had fried chicken.  Course you had to dress them that day.  Right, go out and catch the old chicken and scald it and pick it   that was what  I always had to do, was pick it.  We had chicken and then steak if you could afford a steak.  We used to go to a country Sunday school and there   d be two or three families  come home with you after church and eat dinner with you.  When I   d get home from Beum, after I rode that horse three miles, I was  starved to death. Well there was generally always something to eat. This  particular evening or afternoon, my mother wasn   t there, I don   t know where  17  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lalicker  Cully  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Lalicker  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Cole  she was at, but there was a quart of pears open, I ate nearly a whole quart of  pears. I didn   t want a pear for years  (Laughter) Oh, oh I   m telling you, those  were good. I don   t remember whether I got punished for eating all of them, but  I think I was sick enough she didn   t punish me.  When you got sick, were there any sorts of home remedies your mothers used?  Skunk oil.  Oh, we didn   t have that. My Dad always had liquor, always had liquor and  there was some kind of salve or something.  What did they mix up with that skunk oil? They   d render that skunk fat.  Oh, my gosh.  My mother didn   t use it.  No, we didn   t have that.  Well we did.  And what was skunk oil supposed to do for you?  Well they mixed something with it I think, and then whenever you   d come  down with a real bad old cold or something, they   d put it all over your chest.  Well now the oil didn   t stink like skunk, it didn   t, it really didn   t have any  odor to it, the skunk oil didn   t.  It soaked in, I suppose.  My mother would say,    If you aren   t better    I   ll mix up some skunk oil,    and  boy, I tell you, we could get better in nothing flat.  Yeah, suddenly you felt better. (Laughs)  And they put a few drops of coal oil on a teaspoon of sugar and you   d take that  for a real bad cough.  I don   t think I ever had to take that. I don   t remember what I took but     Oh I did.  I remember to clean you out every twice a year in the spring you would take a  great big tablespoon full of castor oil and then you   d take a mouthful of ground  coffee and chew that.  That doesn   t sound pleasant at all. (Laughter)  I remember one remedy they had, and that   s when you burned your hand, and I  18  Lemons  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Cully  had burned my hand and they thought that heat would draw that out. Well of  course it drove it further, and I screamed and I hollered. I remember that, but  they held it up to the lamp, I had to hold that hand up to the lamp, and it hurt  so bad, but they thought they was doing something.  Right, right.  Well instead of putting it in some of that cold water, speaking of cold water, in  the winter time when we   d go to bed the next morning you   d get up and, we  always had a bucket or I think it was a big old stone jar or something that we  had our water in, our drinking water, and that sucker would be froze. That   s  how cold the house was. And we had so many old quilts and stuff on you, and  I was of course a kid, I couldn   t hardly turn over at night cause it was just so  heavy you just couldn   t hardly turn over. My mother would always warm up a  little old blanket or something and they   d have bricks at the foot of the bed and  then wrap that. She   d get it warm around the stove, wrap it around you and  you   d run into this old cold bedroom because it never had any heat all day.  Right.  Tuck you in bed under all these old covers and you had to lay there all night  cause you couldn   t turn over. (Laughter)  Yep, I remember heating up bricks and wrapping them up for your feet.  And they felt so good didn   t they?  Yes, they sure did.  Run in that old cold bedroom.  Oh gosh yes, and we always had flannel blankets I mean or something to.  Not these slick tight sheets.  Yeah, there wasn   t sheets, it was blankets or, blanket sheets, that   s what they  call, blanket sheets.  I was supposed to get in the kindling so Dad could make a fire the next  morning. One morning Dad got up and there was no kindling. He came in and  woke me up, and he said,    This time I   ll go out and find some kindling but if it  ever happens again, you   re the one that   s going to get out of your nice warm  bed and go get the kindling.    And I don   t think I ever forgot again. (Laughter)  That was enough of a threat.  Right, well what he said he did. I mean, that wasn   t, that wasn   t no    what if    it  was the law.  His word was his bond.  19  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Lalicker  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Lalicker  He said that   s the way it was.  Well I wanted to ask you Miss Cole about   you had answered this question on  here about gypsies, tramps and you said that you had remembered your  mother giving the family a comb. Could you tell us that story?  Well, there were people that were moving, just going through the country. I  don   t know, we always called them gypsies. But anyway they come down the  road and they stopped and come in and, I think they was wanting something  for their horses, to feed their horses or something and they always got a little  bit of food each place they   d stop. And this wagon   it was an old covered  wagon, that   s what it was, just a covered wagon   and they had several little  kids. You   ve probably seen little kids, that their hair was just so matted     maybe not, but it was just so matted. It was pitiful and my mother asked her if  she had a comb and she said,    Well we started out with one but we lost it  somewhere along the way.    So my mother went in the house and scrounged  around and she found a comb   one of these, they had them about this big in  them days. We did and it had three or four teeth out of it somewhere but she  gave that to this lady and they were so happy to get that comb so they could  comb their hair again. But they were just so matted, it was just terrible.  Do you remember anything about ever being scared of these people you called  gypsies?  No, I wasn   t afraid of anyone.  We weren   t afraid of people then.  We never did lock the doors.  No, doors were never locked.  Everything was wide open.  If they were it was    cause they were blown open by the wind.  Yeah. (Laughter)  I was going to say, we used to say, we used to have a door that the wind would  blow open every so often.  We had plenty of wind.  Yep we had plenty of wind.  While we   re on that subject of transient type people, tramps or hobos, did you  ever have any experiences of tramps or hobos coming by looking for work?  Yes. They stopped in there and they said they didn   t have very much and stuff,  20  Lemons  Cully  Kite  Cully  Kite  Cully  Lemons  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  and my lands, about three or four of them unloaded and started picking up  everything they could get, and my mother went out there and told them she  was giving them so long to get off the place and they left.  Good for her.  Well see, we lived off of the highway or off of the road you see, a fourth of a  mile   nearly half a mile from the north road and a fourth a mile from the east  road, so we didn   t have those. There was a fellow that come through, of course  they sold Watkins products and I can remember my mother, right after my  daddy died she would give him maybe a couple of old hens or a dozen eggs or  something for some spices or something like that. He made regular trips  maybe once every two or three years he   d come by, but as far as people  coming in wanting, hobos or gypsies, we didn   t have them.  It seems fairly dependent on where you lived.  Yes.  If you lived close to an intersection.  Yes, if you lived on a road where   I imagine that was right.  Well what about any friends or neighbors you had that left when times got  hard?  Well the neighbors just about a quarter of a mile north of us had a girl just  about my age and we played together all the time and when all these dust  bowls came up, why they had a auction sale and sold everything they had and  went to California.  Did you stay in touch with your friend?  No, probably couldn   t have afforded the three cent postage stamp, cause I  remember one time another girl that was in the vicinity she lived this other  way but anyway we was playing together one day. I don   t know how come we  even got together but anyway, she had a little old rubber doll about so long. It  had a little green dress with red ruffles for sleeves and a red sash, and I thought  that was the most beautiful dress that ever was. She said,    Well I   ll sell it to  you for a penny.    So I went to the folks asking if I could have a penny to buy  that dress and they said    Well we don   t have a penny to spare, we can   t do it.     And you think about it now what a penny back then was     Worth something.  Cause you could probably buy a shirt for seven cents and maybe a pair of  overalls for a quarter, but they told me they just didn   t have a penny to spare.  But that   s how hard up times was. I mean you watched your pennies.  I can   t, I was trying to think when I ran across that question. I don   t think it  21  Cole  Cully  Lalicker  Cully  Lalicker  Cully  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Kite  Lemons  Cole  Lemons  Cole  was anybody around there that left on account of the dustbowl.  Well the Radcliff   s did.  Right now I can   t think of anybody.  We didn   t have anybody that lived close to us leave.  They just kept struggling like we did.  Probably didn   t have anything to leave on.  Well now, that   s just it.  Yeah, they couldn   t afford to.  Yeah it took money to leave, but my dad said he   d worked hard for that land  and he was going to stay there as long as he could. When he homesteaded on  that place, the rules were you had to homestead, build this little house and live  there for six months and then it was yours. So he did that. He was 19 years old,  he was by himself, he lived on it, then after he got his six months he went to  Woodward and worked in a shoe shop and, got some money so he could buy  some lumber to build him a proper house cause he just had a little old shack  that he was living in. When he finally got back out there, his little old shack  was gone, somebody had stole it, they had moved it. But he was gone for about  six months or so.  He didn   t go back to it then?  No, not for about six months or so, cause it wasn   t like just jumping in the car  and going you know for about 12 miles north of here to Woodward.  Yeah, I know, you rode a horse back then.  Somebody stole his house.  They didn   t rob it, they stole it.  They stole his house, they did.  It seems crazy now, but     So he built him another one and then by the time that I come along he had built  another house and we always called that other little,    the shack    that   s just  what we called it,    the shack   , and in the summer time why we   d usually put a  bed out there and some of us girls would sleep out in the shack with all the  windows and doors open you know. That   s where Mom did her washing was  out in the shack. Course we didn   t have any running water and my dad and my  brother, they built a little old thing up against the shack and they set a barrel up  on top and we filled that barrel in the summertime early in the morning, and  22  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lalicker  Cully  then course they had some old gunny sacks I think, on frames or something  around it, and you could go out there at night and turn the spigot and have your  shower before you   d go to bed out of this barrel of warm water. We   d do that  in the summertime, and that was great.  Oh yeah, didn   t have to get in the tub.  Then, didn   t have to carry the tub in and carry the tub out cause we had to take  a bath just in an old washtub.  Well we had an oblong.  We didn   t have an oblong tub until I was in high school. (Laughter)  Well I guess we didn   t either    til, yeah you   re right.  But we   d climb the ladder and fill that old barrel by bucket, you just climb, get  a bucket and climb it and tip that white barrel and then that night everybody  could get under there and take a little shower. You   d have to be real careful  and not use too much water, had to be enough for everybody. (Laughter)  Well what would you say was your fondest memory of this time?  I don   t know, like I say, we didn   t know we were hard up, we were always  having fun.  No, there were other people that had more money than we did, and had more  things.  It didn   t bother us.  That didn   t seem to bother me.  Didn   t bother me a bit.  No.  Of course I wasn   t old enough to really see what, cause we didn   t get off of the  farm very often.  Oh no, well, before my father died he bought a Dodge car, I had a picture of  that I should have brought it, a 19   I think it was a    25 or    26 Dodge car, and  I   m telling you, we were uptown  They really thought you were moving up.  Yeah I know it, and of course it had the curtains, you put curtains on the side.  He didn   t live too long after we bought that but anyway that was a highlight in  my life.  23  Cole  Cully  Kite  Lalicker  Kite  Lalicker  Cole  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  Lemons  Lalicker  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Well I know our old Model-T when it was running, it had curtains.  Yeah, this was black and with a cloth top. I   ve got a picture of him and I in it  down there but I didn   t get here with it. But that was a highlight of my life.  Anything you remember in particular, that was being a highlight of times back  then?  Well I don   t know.  Maybe a day when you didn   t have to work on the farm?  No, there wasn   t any.  No there wasn   t any days you didn   t have to work, was there?  You worked from the time you got up    til you went to bed.  When did you leave the farm? How old were you when you left there? Were  you through school or get married or something that, where you left the farm?  Well that farm yeah, but I lived on a farm when I got married.  Yeah, when did you get married?  1935.  So you were on with your mother and siblings until then? Did you ever notice  a time anything, anything that sort of stands out as you kind of went, whoa,  things are kind of hard now? Was there ever a time you just kind of?  Oh my lands, you didn   t have time to think about that   What about you guys any time when you kind of went,    Oh, things are kind of  bad now   ?  Even when my brothers worked away from home, why, that just made that  much more for us to do.  Yeah, I guess that would be true.  Well like I say, everybody was hard up and we didn   t leave the farm. The kids  didn   t, very seldom I mean of course now we went about a half a mile to  Sunday school and church, we walked back and forth. We   d walk up there and  walk home and sometimes they   d have a revival up there and I remember  having to walk home when it   d be dark and so cold. I didn   t know why in the  world we had to go up there, I was so sleepy. (Laughter)  Well the church we went to was down at Tierrce Chapel it was on south of the  little red school house. Of course, there was a church in Arnett but my  24  Kite  Cully  Kite  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Cully  mother   s sisters went to this Tierrce Chapel church so when we went to church  that   s where we went. We didn   t go every Sunday of course, especially in the  wintertime.  How do you spell that church name, what was that?  Tierrce Chapel.  That   s an odd name,    Tierrce    So is,    Beum   .  Let   s see, what was his   the guy that either owned the land or built the church  or the first minister, seems like his name was Tierrce, the way I remember it.  Do you remember something that marks your memory of when things got  better?  Well, when the weather changed, we begin to get rain.  Yes, when the rain came.  It   s when the rains began to come,    38,    39,    40, along in there. It seems like,  and the prices of what we had to sell, I think the New Deal must have come in  some, Roosevelt was in then, and I think the New Deal came in of which, of  course we thought that was wonderful. We didn   t know we   d get into the mess  we   re in now, but the government   s involved, but anyway it was helping the  farmers keep what they had and to keep going.  So would you say that people in the Gage area were very supportive of FDR  and the New Deal?  I really don   t remember, I just knew he was president.  Yes, he was a democrat wasn   t he? My relatives are die-hard democrats so he  was a wonderful man and he did wonderful things.  Yeah, I   m sure there   s lots of people that were just the opposite, that they were  republican so he wasn   t.  Yeah, that   s right, and then when I married, I married a republican, but you  know, it don   t mean that much to me.  Me either. I   m not a die-hard.  It   s the person that I try to look at.  Well what would you say that has affected you the most having lived through  the dirty thirties and the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma, what do you think has  affected you the most and that you still see that today?  Learning how to save, and what you have, spend wisely and keep it. I mean  25  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Lalicker  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Kite  Cully  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Lemons  take care of it.  And use what you have.  And use what you have, yes.  And appreciate it.  That   s right.  How about for you? What kind of things have you carried with you because  you lived through that time?  Never throw anything away. (Laughter)  I don   t know, we never did figure it was a    time    or anything like that.  Yeah, just normal day stuff?  That was just life.  But I think those who did go through the Dust Bowl days, I think they come  out better people, most of them did because they knew what a nickel was.  These kids now, they don   t know what a dollar, or a hundred dollars is. But I  think that   s one thing that most of the Dust Bowl people can appreciate now.  So you think the Dust Bowl had some positive side effects to it, the Depression  and the drought?  Yes, later on, they didn   t have it then, but later on. I think it taught people how  to save, how to control what they had and, not waste. There   s so much waste  now, so much.  Did the Dust Bowl and those dust storms change how you felt about the  environment and Mother Nature? You said that when it started to rain again,  that   s when it marked good time so; you watch the weather a little closer than  you did before?  Man, during that Dust Bowl times I know we watched the weather, we   d look  up there and see a little cloud. Oh we   d be so excited to see it.  Oh I know it, just prayed,    come on give us some drops   .  But it wouldn   t, if it did rain it   d just showered. Because we had beds outside  cause it was so hot in the summertime that we   d even sleep outside and, if a  little old cloud     When it rained in a way it kind of made things worse for a little bit cause then  there   d be this mud everywhere.  26  Cully  Lalicker  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Kite  Cully  Cole  Cully  Yeah, after.  Especially where some people lived and they lived in that country where this  mud was and they couldn   t go anywhere.  My mother sowed old gunny sacks together and hung them up over the, we  had a south door, hung them up over that, had a big old tub of water, we   d  carry water to put in that tub and we   d get those gunny sacks wet, hang it back  up on the door and oh that breeze just felt so good. (Laughter) Well of course  they would dry out; you know 30 minutes or 45.  Have to soak it again.  We   d soak it again and hang it up there and stand in front, oh that was just  great that breeze cause it felt so good. (Laughs)  This house, my dad built a house over here, I think it   s these two rooms. Well I  think he moved it from over here to where it is, then he built on this kitchen.  Then there   s a porch on the north side, and this is on the south, we never  suffered from heat in the summer because.  Nice south breezes.  Because see they were screened in and that breeze would blow through there  and it was, we never suffered from the heat, I don   t think the summers got  quite as hot as they do now.  Oh I remember. They were terrible hot.  Well I guess that maybe I didn   t. Of course we lived on a creek when it got hot  I   d go down and play in the sand, picked up poison ivy.  What would you do if you got poison ivy? What   d you slap on that to keep it  from itching?  My mother would open up a shell   shotgun shell   and take the powder out  and mix sweet cream with that and rub it over.  Sometimes I think parents would just see how much their kids would put up  with, on these cures. (Laughter)  Well anyway you didn   t scratch it.  Well no, I mean they really thought they was doing good I   m sure.  But that   s the one thing that, course we had such Poison Ivy all over that creek  and till I learned what it looked like, see it   s a three leaved green thin. Well  they finally taught me what it looked like, well then I began to stay away, but  I   d catch it every summer. Every summer I   d catch Poison Ivy and here come  the shotgun powder and sweet cream.  27  Lalicker  Kite  Lemons  Lalicker  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Cole  Lemons  Then after I was married, we lived up at Chaney and you never had anything in  the house to eat that you didn   t have covered up and you had to have it covered  up good too and you   d go out to the chicken house to gather eggs and you had  to knock the, push the dirt off of them before you could gather your eggs.  Had to dig for your eggs   Right, dig them out.  Yep, and then I gathered them twice a day and then later on when you   d go  out, there you   d do the same thing over again.  It was my job to set the table, and of course we had an oil cloth on the table  and I   d get a wet rag and I   d wash it off and then wash out that rag and I   d  have to do that at least twice and sometimes three times. Get your spoon, knife  and fork and put it down, get your plate out of the cabinet, wipe the dust out of  it, put your plate upside down, get your glass and wipe it with your tea towel  and set it upside down. That   s the way you set, the table    til the meal was  ready, and then when you set down why then you took this out and set it up.  And flies, we had so many flies in the house and we   d open the front door and  everybody would get clear to the back in the other rooms and get tea towels,  we   d shake them.  Shoo the flies out?  Yeah, and they   d go out the door, then we   d go back to the back and do that  again    til we could get all the flies out that we could, then we   d get the fly  swatter and kill flies. I remember in the summertime when the harvesters  would come, well we always cooked dinner for them. I   d set around the table  and shoo the flies away so they could eat without flies getting on their food. I  mean, cause there were just that many flies, and of course we had some  screens on our windows but they probably had holes in them, I don   t know.  Yeah, they   d come in every time the door was open.  The old back door that we had at that time was just boards, just stacking down  boards and then had another board cross wise and you could see cracks out that  door. Those old flies probably just crawled in them cracks, I don   t know.  (Laughter) Oh they had so many flies. Tell you I sure appreciate the fact that  we don   t have flies now.  I do too; we got ways to get rid of them too.  What about bed bugs, did you ever have to get rid of bed bugs?  No, but I had the itch when I was a kid.  Yeah?  28  Cole  Kite  Cole  Cully  Cole  Lalicker  Cole  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Kite  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Cully  My oldest brother went to Stillwater on some kind of a something and they  stayed over night and he slept with some other kid, come home, had the itch.  What was the itch?  Well I don   t know that   s just what we called it, it   s got a fancy, long name I   m  sure. You just itch. Your skin itches, you go and scratch it off, and it was some  kind of a bug or something I suppose that begun it.  Yeah, I don   t know what it was but yeah I remember it.  You   d just itch, just everywhere, and you   d scratch it and it   d get red and what  was it called, but just    the itch   ? Every one of our family had it.  We always said,    The seven years itch   . (Laughter)  Yeah, seven years itch.  That   s a real thing, too.  I don   t know what the medical name was for it, but yeah.  They took Virgil to the doctor at Shattuck when he came down with it so bad  and they give him some kind a great big old bottle of something. Oh, it  smelled terrible, just smelled terrible, and put that all over him and washed all  the bedding, but I mean it just, it went through everybody and I was the last  one to get it and when I did come down with it, it was in between my fingers  and they just split and it   d be red and itched just, and if you scratched em it  made it worse. I had to put that old stinking stuff on and then whenever you  got to where you didn   t itch why they washed all the bedding or burned it or  something. I know sometimes they had to burn bedding cause it was in the  bedding you know just, but he   d went to Stillwater on some kind of 4-H  something and he said he noticed that old boy scratching all night and so then  he had it. (Laughs)  Oh, my gosh.  Found out why.  He had the itch.  Is there anything that ah, we didn   t ask you about that?  I know we always had something to eat, but we sure ate a lot of beans.  Yes, we always had something to eat might not of been what you wanted but.  Didn   t go hungry though.  No, we didn   t go hungry.  29  Cole  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Cully  The kids used to joke, we   d say,    What are we going to have today, are we  going to have potatoes and beans or are we going to have beans and potatoes?     Choice one or choice two.  During those dry days after the dust bowl was kind of over anyway the years it  was dry, about all we could raise was black eyed peas. Oh, we had black-eyed  peas.  We raised butter beans and then I   d have to pick them things, and they had a  thing on the end of the bean pod about like that, just like a needle. It was just  sharp as it could be and course they let them dry on the vine. Then in  September, that   s when we   d have to pick them. When we got home from  school, we   d have to go to the butter bean patch and pick them butter beans.  And oh man, I had my fingers stuck up so bad cause you   d think you were  picking it where you wouldn   t hit one of them. Well, then there   d be another  one there that jabbed you.  We never did raise butter beans.  Well we did.  But I remember those black-eyed peas.  How lucky you were that you didn   t get to have to pick them   I don   t remember butter beans.  So do you eat black-eyed peas on New Year   s Day for good luck?  Sure, yeah we liked them too cause they was good and good for you.  Yeah, I like black-eyed peas.  I still like them.  You just kind of said that like maybe you weren   t a big black-eyed pea fan.  Well, I still like them. I still eat them.  My folks used to by beans by the 100-pound sack. When he   d go to town he   d  by a hundred pound sack of beans.  Flour and sugar, all that. Course you didn   t go to town very often. Oh one of  the things that I can remember well, when my father was still living he   d go to  Shattuck which was 10, let   s see 8, 9, 10 must have been about 11 miles from  where we lived, and he wouldn   t go the highway, there was a mile east of  there. Well that was just a mile from where we lived. He   d go up that road and  he   d leave early in the morning and my mother would fix ice cream. I mean  30  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Lemons  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  she   d make the custard, get it cooled, and he would bring home a block, a  hundred pound block of ice and we had a six gallon can of ice cream. Oh man,  that wasn   t very often.  Once in a while for a treat.  In the summer time we   d maybe two or three times during the summer, but  we   d have   and oh, was that ice cream good cause it was made out of cream,  whole milk, eggs.  It   d kill you now cause you had raw eggs in it, I   m sure.  Those raw eggs aren   t near as bad for you as they think now, yeah.  Well during that time when the government took over I remember my dad  furnished a team of horses and a slip. Now a slip was a just like a great big  shovel.  That the horses pulled.  That the horses pulled and you held on to it like this, and they drug the dirt up  and made that highway north of Shattuck. He had to drive them horses down  there, it was probably eight miles or ten, all this, and used that slip and he got   2 a day, and that   s what saved us really, cause he got  2 a day and I  remember he   d take a boiled egg, a cottage cheese sandwich and maybe a  cookie or a piece of cake or something, but we didn   t get to eat the eggs or this  cookie or cake but once a week, he   d have a desert with his. But can you  imagine eating a boiled egg and a cottage cheese sandwich and maybe a  cookie for your lunch?  I   ve never heard of anybody having a cottage cheese sandwich.  No, I never did.  Well there wasn   t any way to keep anything from spoiling, and he   d have to  leave every morning when it was dark and he never got home    til it was dark  and we had to do all the chores when he done that, we had to do everything.  But I   ve often thought of that, just how in the world, what if I had to go and eat  cottage cheese sandwich and a boiled egg and maybe a cookie for my lunch,  and work these horses all day and get  2. But  2 went a long way.  That cottage cheese was made fresh every day too wasn   t it?  I suppose I remember us making it. Mom even used to make some of that, they  had a cheese press and he might have had just a cheese sandwich, too.  Yeah.  She   d start out with a tub full of milk and whenever she got it through we   d  have a round of cheese about that big around and about that high maybe, and it  31  Cully  Cole  Kite  Cole  Kite  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Kite  Cole  had this old press where you   d just wind it down and down and down and  down and squeeze that.  Moisture, whey out of it.  She   d put some kind of coloring in it and it was usually kind of orangish like  and made her own cheese, made her own hominy when they had corn, and we  ate boiled wheat for breakfast a lot of time was our cereal for breakfast. She   d  go to the barn and get some wheat that we   d raised and wash it real good and  put it on to soak and soak it all night and cook it the next morning and it   d take  thirty minutes or so to boil I suppose. We   d put pure cream on it and eat it and  I thought it was delicious.  Would it be kind of like oatmeal in texture?  Well it was just wheat. No it was still in its kernels but they   d be soft and it  was just whole wheat.  The first health cereal.  I guess.  You pay a big expensive price for that now, well minus the cream.  And we ate a lot of mush.  Yeah, we had mush.  And then fry it for breakfast the next morning and I thought that was so good.  Yep, it was cause we didn   t have it very often, I remember.  But we ate what we had and like, if my folks would butcher a pig, well there  was probably three families right there, they   d divide that pig up. Well then the  next time it   d be this family   s time to butcher one, and then it would this  families to butcher one and we   d just divide it up because you knew there was  no refrigeration or nothing you had to either eat it right then or can it, and I  know the folks canned a lot of sausage and stuff. One way they fixed sausage  they   d fry it, put it in an old crock, big old white crock jars, pour enough  grease on it, they   d fill just as much and then pour over grease and then put  another layer of sausage and grease and another layer of sausage down in the  cellar and we   d go down dig some sausage out of that grease and take it up and  warm it up and that   s what we ate, thought it was good.  Was good.  Probably was, yeah.  It was good.  32  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  Kite  Cole  Cully  Kite  Lemons  Cully  Kite  Cully  Kite  Cully  Lalicker  Kite  Lalicker  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Kite  It didn   t have any insecticides or pesticides or anything else in it.  But just cover it up with that grease and it   d keep.  That   s right, and it   d keep for a long time in the cellar.  We   d eat it up and then somebody else would butcher, like Lelah said, they   d  eat the brains and everything else and Mom would make headcheese.  Oh gosh, yes.  See them old pig   s heads, ugh  (Laughs) And boil them you know.  Pigs feet, gosh we had pigs feet.  And they   d boil them.  Would you eat calf brains or cow brains today?  I never did eat the brains, my dad did but I wouldn   t do it.  I doubt it.  I   ve never had brains.  Me either.  Those chicken brains it the only ones that I can remember.  I never even knew chickens had brains.  They were little but oh were they good. Oh it was good.  Did you eat them with tweezers or something?  They were little.  Well brains are real good when you mix them with eggs.  You like that?  Yes.  I   ve never had it so I can   t really say.  Me either and I don   t want to have it   No I don   t think I   d eat them; I think they have them sometimes in the stores.  Oh yeah.  33  Cole  Lalicker  Lemons  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Lalicker  Cole  Lemons  Cole  Lalicker  Cole  Cully  Cole  Cully  Cole  But I like that headcheese that my mom made.  Well I went some place and ate some of those and I decided I could do that  and I wasn   t very big and my mother says,    Well I guess you can try this when  we butcher if you want to.    And I fixed that and my lands I ate those up before  I hardly got them fixed.  They have some fans somewhere for brains anyway.  But they didn   t waste anything.  No, we sure didn   t waste anything.  We had some relatives that were on my mother   s side that lived in Kansas  City, Missouri. She   d send boxes and boxes of clothes down to us and my  mother would look through them and tear some of them apart and make us  girls little dresses and stuff out of the stuff that she sent. I remember one time  there was, I suppose it was an evening gown, it was real thin, it just had blood  all over it and I never did understand why she sent that dress.  Oh, for heaven sakes.  You can wash it out.  Well I suppose you could of but    (Laughs)  Maybe she   s trying to hide something by sending it to your ho   But anyway we didn   t     You   d have to soak it first but you can get it out.  But we didn   t use that one. Anything, I mean every scrap of material that you  had on the place you used, you made it for a quilt or done something with it.  Or a dress or blouse or something.  You didn   t throw nothing away, and my mother ripped up old suits and stuff  that she would send and made quilts, comforters and some of them heavy  comforters I had over me when I couldn   t turn over. (Laughs)  Then they   d put a lining on it and put some cotton in it or something.  It was so cold, if they hadn   t we   d froze to death like that water; we   d of been  stiff (Laughs) when morning came  People that didn   t ever live through that  don   t know what hard times are.  34  Cully No, they sure don   t.  -------  -------
