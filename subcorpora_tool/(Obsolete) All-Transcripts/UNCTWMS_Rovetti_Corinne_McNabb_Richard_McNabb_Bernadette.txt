JW: This is Jessie Wilkerson and it&#8217;s May 9, 2011, and I&#8217;m doing interviews as part of the Southern Oral History Program&#8217;s Women&#8217;s Movement Project.
BM: I&#8217;m Bernie McNabb and I first started at the clinic as counseling director and then became director.
RM: And I&#8217;m Richard McNabb and was instrumental in getting the clinic started and was director for some time and then Bernie took over for me. But the clinic really was an outgrowth of Planned Parenthood. There were a few people on the board that after the [19]73 decision of the Supreme Court felt that Planned Parenthood here should open a clinic. The board was very split on it, but I was one of those that felt very strongly that that should be done and worked hard on a financial model for it. But we never could get it off the ground with the board. And it was probably appropriate for this community. They had the sense of the community, and they still have not made that move and it may be that that&#8217;s correct for them.   But anyway, out of the frustration of that, as it happened, there was a fellow named Gerald Grossman who had started a clinic in Buffalo, New York, and another one in Atlanta. His mode of operation was to try to get Planned Parenthood to invite him into the community to start a clinic and he did that. They said, &#8220;Well, sure, come on.&#8221; So Dr. Grossman came here and began. He rented a piece of property and began to recruit physicians. He had a helper that was named Steven Blackman, who actually moved to Knoxville and did a lot of the legwork, and I was hired to work with Steven Blackman and with Grossman and to be the first director of their clinic, which was the Knoxville Center for Reproductive Health. We opened in the summer of 1975.   And the opening was very disappointing. The volume did not seem to be there to satisfy their wishes, and they would like for me to have done more to try to jazz that up and get it going. That wasn&#8217;t my cup of tea. I felt like we needed to do good work and the work would come slowly, but it would come. So they were on the verge of dismissing me, and I had gotten some money together and offered to buy them out and I thought that I was successful. But I think in reality they were delighted. (laughs) So in a way, I bailed them out of what they had decided was not a good beginning and was not going to be successful, but that&#8217;s where we started. And we had a wonderful doctor, Dr. Mueller, and we hired [him]. Bernie was one of our first staff people, that first round of staff people. She was wonderful at her job and, as I discovered, in many other ways because we then married. So that&#8217;s where we started.   It&#8217;s been so interesting to see--. For me, I learned a great deal just from watching the work that went on here and from watching the patients that came here. Boy, it&#8217;s an education in women&#8217;s rights and what women, if they are given the choice and the knowledge to take care of themselves, what a great job they can do with that. They can do great things with those choices, and Bernie and I have felt that from the very first, that this is a place where for women, the rubber touches the road. They&#8217;re up against it and if helped to see where they are and make a good decision, it can change their lives and often does. If they take responsibility for what they have decided to do, it can make a real difference in their lives. So to me, that was a real education because that was a facet that I had never seen in working with Planned Parenthood. We were trying to educate people about birth control. There&#8217;s a great deal more to it than that.  It&#8217;s a growth opportunity. It&#8217;s a-what would you call it, Bernie? We used to talk about, not a learning experience, but it&#8217;s a teachable moment. When people come up against the choice of terminating a pregnancy or carrying it, it&#8217;s a life-changing event and it&#8217;s a teachable moment for that woman. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been into.   BM: And helping women come to terms with making responsible decisions in their lives, whatever that choice might be, is really important.  RM: Yes, what the choice is doesn&#8217;t matter so much. It&#8217;s making the decision and taking responsibility for it.   JW: Can each of you say what you remember about the moment when the [Roe v. Wade] decision was made? What was the environment like in Knoxville and what were people&#8217;s reactions and what were your reactions? Do you recall any stories or any moments during that period?  BM: I think Dick remembers exactly where he was when he heard.  RM: Yes, yes. I was driving in downtown Knoxville and heard it on the radio. And I teared up because I just knew that that was going to be important because it gives a woman something that she can do. Birth control is fine, but it doesn&#8217;t always work. And if it doesn&#8217;t work, if it fails, or if she&#8217;s in a relationship that fails or if she&#8217;s got lousy information-which is so available to kids in high school or younger-with those failures, you need something you can do. And up to that point, the answer was, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re sorry, but there&#8217;s nothing you can do. You&#8217;ve been bad and there&#8217;s nothing you can do.&#8221; Well, here was a thing you could do and it just seemed to me that, as I say, I teared up.   JW: Do you remember, Bernie?  BM: Not at the time. I was in graduate school and I wasn&#8217;t really interested in reproductive health issues or I didn&#8217;t know that I was at the time until I did a practicum at Planned Parenthood. With that practicum, it was pre any clinics existing here, and we were still sending people over the state line or to New York for abortions where it was legal. So the actual day, no, I don&#8217;t remember. Do you, Corinne?  CR: I&#8217;m trying to place where I was in &#8217;73. I do remember because I had been working previously in my first two years in college when my awareness began, and we were petitioning and really kind of being at the forefront of that fight for this should be a legal thing. So I do recall waiting and knowing that it was going to come before the Supreme Court and anticipating that there would be an answer at some point. I wasn&#8217;t as actively engaged at that point because there had been a switch in my life and I&#8217;d switched colleges and had been home for two years and then went away. Though my interest in women&#8217;s health was still going on, I wasn&#8217;t as much of an activist in that, the fight for those rights and being involved. But I remember being on campus, and I remember there was a few of us that screamed out and said, &#8220;Finally, finally this will be a legal choice and this will change women&#8217;s lives.&#8221;   JW: Why was Planned Parenthood making the decision it made not to support clinics in this area?  RM: I think something I&#8217;ve heard all my life about controversial kinds of things is that Knoxville&#8217;s just not ready for that yet, and I think that&#8217;s the way that board felt. It was just another thing that Knoxville wasn&#8217;t ready for yet.   JW: It&#8217;s a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, though, right? (laughs)  RM: Well, it really is.   CR: It kind of keeps you exactly where you are and nothing changes.   RM: Yes, it does, it does, but it&#8217;s been, whether it was, well, almost anything. Legal liquor, Knoxville&#8217;s not ready for that. Certainly they weren&#8217;t ready to integrate the schools. Just all kinds of things that they&#8217;re just not ready for yet. And people that decide that are the politicians, the newspapers. It&#8217;s never decided in public. It&#8217;s just sort of an agreement among   the--. You just bump into it. You want to do something? You bump into Knoxville not being  ready for it and that, I&#8217;m sure as the dickens, bumped into it on the clinic. That board, they were torn about it because they were interested in birth control and women&#8217;s rights, but they weren&#8217;t interested in sticking their neck out.
BM: Yeah, and nobody applauded when this clinic started. There wasn&#8217;t a lot of community support.
RM: No.
BM: There still isn&#8217;t.
CR: There still isn&#8217;t.
RM: No.
BM: Thirty-something years later, there still isn&#8217;t. Nobody is calling up and saying they want to support us or &#8220;we&#8217;ll be there for you.&#8221; They can be picketers. So that hasn&#8217;t changed and the climate hasn&#8217;t changed. We&#8217;re still seeing what they&#8217;re trying to do. I&#8217;m appalled.
CR: In fact, it&#8217;s gotten much worse.
BM: Yes, that they are going to in Iowa, Idaho, I shouldn&#8217;t say which, they&#8217;re trying to get women considering abortions having to go to crisis pregnancy centers for their counseling.
CR: That&#8217;s Georgia and Nebraska.
BM: Nebraska, okay. It&#8217;s amazing to me that we are still fighting those same issues. If somebody had said thirty-five years ago, &#8220;You will be dealing with the same things in thirty-five years,&#8221; I would have thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s not possible.&#8221; But that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re dealing with and to me, it&#8217;s patronizing and condescending to think that a woman has to wait twenty-four or forty-eight hours, that she doesn&#8217;t know herself well enough to decide what she needs to do.
CR: Or that she already hasn&#8217;t taken twenty-four or forty-eight or seventy-two, three weeks, and they keep postponing until they&#8217;re further along because they&#8217;re trying to make their decision and decide, and then finally make that decision and come in and then somebody imposes upon them a further waiting time because, &#8220;You really just don&#8217;t know what kind of a decision you might need to make,&#8221; which is very patronizing.
RM: &#8220;You&#8217;re just not ready for that yet."
JW: So in those early, in that first year-or when did you come? When were you hired as staff?
BM: It was two weeks after the clinic opened.
JW: Okay. So you were both right at the start.
BM: I had interviewed, but they had a counseling director and Dick offered me a part-time position. I was just graduating and I couldn&#8217;t afford to take a part-time position. So I did not accept the job, and then the first counseling director didn&#8217;t work out. So he offered me the job.
JW: So in those first months or year or couple of years, how did you publicize this service was now available? What was that like, getting people, getting the community aware about the clinic?
RM: Well, we made mailings to physicians, what we called &#8220;newsletters,&#8221; and they were announcing who we were, what we did, and we did those all over east Tennessee.
BM: And we started off doing only abortions the first year.
RM: Yes.
BM: And then added other services.
CR: So I have a question. So does it seem, in looking back, did the majority of those first people who found their way here, were they largely through the referrals from physicians, do you recall?
RM: Well, of course, Planned Parenthood referred to us too, and that was for sure helpful. We got ads in the Yellow Pages. I think those worked. They certainly cost enough.
BM: And we advertised in The Beacon.
RM: In the college newspaper. Yeah, but that&#8217;s been about it.
CR: So another question that I have, Dick, in regards to either I don&#8217;t recall or I never heard the story of how Dr. Mueller got recruited because Dr. Grossman left and then you were left thinking-
BM: Dr. Grossman actually never did abortions.
CR: He actually never.
RM: No, no, he was a psychiatrist.
CR: Oh, okay.
RM: Originally, we had interviewed and planned on using a physician from Oak Ridge, Dr. John Shaunts. Dr. Mueller was going to be the medical director. He was going to oversee what went on in the medical part of the clinic. We had a grand opening kind of a party. There were drinks and hors d&#8217;oeuvres and we invited people in, and Dr. Shaunts was here and Dr. Mueller and his wife were here and the whole staff was here. I don&#8217;t know. When you&#8217;re in a thing like that and you&#8217;re talking to people, you don&#8217;t know really who&#8217;s there. You&#8217;re just talking to the person you&#8217;re talking to and trying to make it all go. But anyway, Steven Blackman, who was the person that I worked with, that lived here in Knoxville and was kind of a partner of Grossman, he found out that Dr. Shaunts was doing some abortions in his office in Oak Ridge, and he felt that was unacceptable. He confronted Shaunts about it at that party, and Shaunts quit. That was that. So it left us with Dr. Mueller, who was not too happy about taking over the whole load.
BM: And Dr. Mueller did not know how he felt about abortion.
RM: No, he didn&#8217;t. He was a loving man, but he didn&#8217;t know how he felt. He had a physician&#8217;s consultant, and he asked him about it. He said, &#8220;This is now, what was illegal is now legal and I don&#8217;t know how I should integrate that into my practice or whether I should or not.&#8221; And the consultant said, &#8220;Well, why not?&#8221; So he felt better about it after that, but he didn&#8217;t want it to dominate his practice. He didn&#8217;t want that to be all he did, so he maintained a private office and he came here two days a week and performed abortions. He was learning as he went along. He was a wonderful gynecologist, a first-rate medical person.
CR: In OB, we sometimes see patients of his that he delivered that come back to the clinic and say, &#8220;Dr. Mueller, he delivered me.&#8221; And they&#8217;re here for either abortion services or GYN services.
RM: But that&#8217;s how he got, he would say, kind of roped into doing it because he felt such a sense of responsibility, and thank goodness he did. I was afraid he might refuse, but he didn&#8217;t.
JW: And how long did he stay?
CR: Twenty-five years?
RM: I would think every bit of twenty-five years.
BM: Yeah.
JW: Was he conflicted that whole time?
CR: He was.  BM: I think so.
CR: Because I remember having a conversation with him towards his retirement party and he still said that personally, he had a very hard time with abortion, but that he felt such a strong responsibility to women. And as Dr. Tompkins, who also then came to work later and had been in a military environment and seeing, we don&#8217;t have this part of the history anymore, both of these men saw women in desperate situations, presenting in emergency rooms trying to self-abort. And so there was a very personal commitment and sense of responsibility to help these women out. And I just remembered him saying, &#8220;I still am conflicted by this, but I don&#8217;t regret a moment of my practice in helping women make decisions that they felt they need to make and to keep them safe.&#8221;
BM: Yeah, and he truly was a compassionate man, truly.
JW: And Bernie, how did you get involved in the counseling or what resources were there for you to become a counselor at an abortion clinic since that was a new, I guess, kind of a new position?
BM: Okay. I did a practicum with Planned Parenthood, okay. So there I learned how to give pregnancy test results. That&#8217;s all Planned Parenthood did at the time was pregnancy test results.
C: Deliver the bad news and say, &#8220;Sorry.&#8221; (laughs)
BM: But we did go over their options, whether it&#8217;s adoption or going out of state for an abortion or carrying it to term. But then when Dick hired me, he sent me to Buffalo to the clinic that Grossman had opened there. And I spent maybe three or four days there trailing counselors and listening to them. I still remember the first counseling session I sat in was a woman who had had three previous abortions and the counselor said, &#8220;So tell me what&#8217;s going on with that? How come you&#8217;re not grasping that you do get pregnant if you don&#8217;t use birth control responsibly?&#8221; And she said, the patient said, &#8220;Well, the first time, I just didn&#8217;t think it would happen to me.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;And the second time, I just thought there&#8217;s no way it could happen to me twice in a year. The third time,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I just knew it couldn&#8217;t happen three times.&#8221; And the counselor said to her, &#8220;Well, it doesn&#8217;t look like thinking is going to work for you.&#8221; (laughs) I never forgot that. That was the first counseling session that I sat through. So that&#8217;s where I got the experience and then you really learn as you go along.   And to me, it was the greatest job in the world, yeah, working at this clinic. I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better job simply because there is no hierarchy here. There is no bureaucracy. You do it because you want to be here, and most people who have worked here say it&#8217;s the best place they&#8217;ve ever worked because you truly are here for the woman. Sometimes we send women away because they&#8217;re not ready to make the decision or they&#8217;re blaming somebody else. They&#8217;re not taking responsibility. It&#8217;s just been a very supportive, compassionate place to work, and I think the patients feel it and I think the staff feels it.  JW: Can you talk about that a little bit more? Maybe all three of you can have an answer for this because I don&#8217;t think it just happens that it&#8217;s a good place to work or that it sounds like it&#8217;s a pretty democratic place, there&#8217;s no hierarchy. So what was that process like of setting up a clinic that really is about the women, that is a good place to work for staff? What are the decisions that went into that or the philosophy?  RM: Well, I think we&#8217;ve already talked kind of about the philosophy. We want to listen to these people. We want to understand what&#8217;s going on and help them to understand what&#8217;s going on and then to medically just do the best job you can. You&#8217;ve got a great doctor. You&#8217;ve got good nursing. You&#8217;ve got good follow-up care. And if you get a core that&#8217;s trying to do that, somebody can figure out when they don&#8217;t fit in. Anything that&#8217;s negative to that makes them feel kind of outside of the group and the rest of the group, it&#8217;s all pretty much self-supporting. I think I saw that, that that&#8217;s the way it ought to be, and tried to guide it that way and employ people that were that way. And a great help was Bernie seeing it that way. She really understood it.   BM: Well, I think that our motivation was always that it needed to be a good place for women to be able to come to, supportive, and like you said, good medical care, but also it needed to be a good place for staff to work. Yeah, decent jobs and decent pay is extremely important.  CR: Yeah, and I think the other really important trait here is that the two of you set up an environment that-it&#8217;s going to tear me up here-is about respect and dignity, and that means respect and dignity for the women who come here for services. It means respect and dignity for the people who work here, and that is a rare thing to sometimes find in a work environment. And I think that you understood that the forces outside were so strong and so divisive and so difficult and sort of like we had to create an environment in here that was supportive and caring and with respect and dignity. Because otherwise, when you&#8217;re constantly battling those outside forces that are bearing down on you, if you&#8217;re divisive inside, if internally you&#8217;re struggling and fighting with each other, there&#8217;s just no way you could provide those services. And I think you set the environment for that.  RM: We really tried not to battle with the people outside. If they want to demonstrate, do that sort of thing, let them, but we&#8217;re going to do what we do in this building and just let it be.  BM: I can remember the time that you were such a strong force. Remember when we were picketed by a hundred-something people that day?   CR: The entire clinic, we were just run around.  BM: Yeah, it was awful. They had taken all the spaces, women that had baby carriages and said they were here for pregnancy tests and I said, &#8220;We&#8217;re not running pregnancy tests today.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s too bad. We&#8217;ll wait.&#8221; And there were hundreds of people out there and they were saying the most vile things. You remember the day that you sat on the wall all day?  RM: Absolutely.  BM: Dick sat on that wall outside, and we all felt protected here for some reason. Dick was out there. They were screaming. They cut off our water. I don&#8217;t know. Was [Joe] Scheidler here then?   RM: I think it was.  BM: Okay. And I can just remember feeling torn, but knowing that Dick was sitting on that wall, taking the brunt of it, was we&#8217;re okay.
CR: And that we could continue to do the work inside. It was like, I don&#8217;t know, it was  sort of like having an angel on the wall sort of protecting us.
RM: Well, that&#8217;s all it was. (laughs) There was nothing I could do, but I did sit there and watch them and not get upset and not get angry and just try to be there.
JW: So how did people get in the clinic? Were you there to help them or--?
RM: If need be. It didn&#8217;t turn out that I needed to be. They didn&#8217;t forcefully try to keep patients out, but they tried to intimidate them. You could just holler at them, say, &#8220;Come on in.&#8221;
JW: What year was that, do you remember?
RM: I don&#8217;t know.
BM: I want to say &#8217;93, &#8217;92 and &#8217;93.
CR: [Those] were the really rough years. Those were the Reagan years.
BM: Reagan said he didn&#8217;t condone clinic bombings, but their heart was in the right place or some blanket statement and then-
CR: The activity became real crazy after that. I mean, Scheidler and Terry Randall, that&#8217;s when Operation Rescue and all those folks, the violence began to escalate and the activities at clinics really escalated at that point.
BM: And we had two baby John Does. The first one sat outside this door, and we came in on a Monday morning and he said he was going to stop the babies being killed and we said, &#8220;That&#8217;s not happening today. Please move away,&#8221; and he said he would not move away. So we had the police come and he refused to move. So they took baby John Doe. He wouldn&#8217;t walk, because he was baby, to jail where he spent eleven months and twenty-nine days because he refused to give his name. And then the day he got out, he had a press conference below this window over here telling us about his marriage. He had met somebody through letters at jail and that&#8217;s the last we ever heard of baby John Doe. Then we had second baby John Doe who came in. Actually, we had a police officer outside the door, a security guard, not police officer, a security guard, and this man said, &#8220;Oh I&#8217;m going in there to meet my wife.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, go on in.&#8221; And he chained himself with a bicycle lock to this banister here.
RM: By the neck.
BM: By the neck, and then destroyed his key.
CR: Didn&#8217;t he swallow it or something?
BM: Or something, yeah. A staff member came running and said, I&#8217;ll never forget. It was Vi. Do you remember that?
CR: I remember exactly.
BM: (panting heavily) &#8220;There&#8217;s a man.&#8221;
CR: There&#8217;s a man.
BM: &#8220;He&#8217;s got a collar.&#8221; I said, &#8220;A priest?&#8221;
CR: You were like playing charades at this point.
BM: And she said, &#8220;No, he&#8217;s locked himself on the banister.&#8221; Anyway, so we asked him to leave. Of course, he couldn&#8217;t leave. So we had to have the police come. The police-
CR: Had to saw the banister.
BM: Had to saw the banister.
CR: Took him with the lock around his neck.
BM: Broke his finger. Remember the police was trying to--? And took him to three locksmiths before they could get the lock away from his neck for jail to accept him. He too spent eleven months and twenty-nine days. You have to be pretty dedicated to what you think is right because he wouldn&#8217;t come into court. He couldn&#8217;t walk because he was a baby. He was representing all babies. And the judge would just say, &#8220;Take him back.&#8221; So we wasted a lot of time going to court, but that was the atmosphere in &#8217;92, &#8217;93.
JW: Was there always an anti-abortion group or when did you see, when did that, was that from the start or was that something that developed over time?
BM: I think we had picketers from the start.
RM: Certainly, the right-to-life people seemed to have always been around or been somewhere. I don&#8217;t know where they come from.
CR: But as early as you can remember, some people were out here. The [19]90s, the &#8217;93, &#8217;94 got really crazy and people were coming from out of state.
RM: Yes, yes.
CR: But the local right to life people were always here.
RM: They would come. We had people that came regularly. It&#8217;s fine not to pay a lot of attention to them, but you remain rather ignorant. So I don&#8217;t know where they come from, and I don&#8217;t know where they go. You know what I mean? They just show up on the sidewalk.
JW: Can you describe, and I don&#8217;t know if you feel the same way, Bernie, but can you describe why you want to remain ignorant about where those people are coming from and what group they&#8217;re with or whatever? How is that helpful or why do you choose to take it that way?
BM: Because you don&#8217;t want to get wrapped up in their stuff. Yeah, you don't want all their angst. I just don&#8217;t want that. I want to stay serene as much as possible and do my job. We were never ones to fight back. Other clinics have different approaches. Deb Walsh was much more--

CR: Aggressive and assertive.
BM: Aggressive, yeah. I think they attacked them more. There was times that we felt like we were so nice that maybe the picketers recognized we were nice, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case. But we never fought back.
RM: That was the great fallacy.
CR: I think some of it was that some of those years were very stressful and stressful for the staff because you&#8217;re coming in through the picketers, which is still the case, but then things were ramped up, and it was very ugly and it was very aggressive. It was very stressful for the staff. I think in part was you came in here, safety. Again, it was, I think, creating this cushion of safety for the women who were also having to come through the same hordes of people yelling and screaming at them and really being quite horrific. So it really was a matter of focusing our energy inwards and providing a safe environment for both staff and people so that we could continue to work because there were some times that it was really hard.
BM: Oh it was very stressful and then there was clinic bombings and doctors being shot. We put the security cameras.
CR: Security system in.
BM: And learned to lock the doors. In the beginning, it wasn&#8217;t like that. We didn&#8217;t have locks on the doors. But because of those years where Scheidler paraded on the sidewalk and dressed in black from head to toe, you did feel threatened.
CR: And I think we did keep awareness of what groups were there and what was going on, but really our focus, I think what you&#8217;re saying, Dick, really is on the day to day operations, we really sort of created somewhat of a barrier of protection for ourselves to not get pulled into those antics and really focus our energy for the services and for the women and for our staff and to keep everybody cohesively feeling safe and okay about coming to work.
BM: But when they started bringing in people like Scheidler and what was his name, Terry.
CR: Terry Randall.
BM: Yeah.
JW: Did he come here?
CR: Scheidler did. I don&#8217;t know if Terry Randall ever was actually here.
BM: Scheidler did.
CR: But representatives of Operation Rescue were certainly here, but Scheidler himself had come at some point.
JW: So was there any sort of state or regional network where you could discuss these things or even share, troubleshoot about how to run a clinic? I&#8217;m just thinking because Atlanta, that&#8217;s where Operation Rescue, that&#8217;s one of the places where it kicked off and there was the siege on Atlanta. But that made me think--. Was there a regional network that you could tap into of other people working at clinics and providing abortions?
BM: We had the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. [They were] really helpful when we were fighting some of those issues when we got the Casey decision out of Pennsylvania. It was Planned Parenthood vs. Casey. They were extremely supportive as well as the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. So you could talk to them about what was happening in other clinics and on what ground they were fighting on. NAF, National Abortion Federation, was also a source of support, but certainly not locally. There was nobody to turn to for support, and really nobody reached out. There was the, what was it, not NOW? What was the pro-choice group here?
CR: Well, there was the Pro-Choice Coalition that we formed later on. That was somewhat helpful. That was really toward the late &#8217;90s.
JW: So there wasn&#8217;t a feminist network in the &#8217;80s or early &#8217;90s?
CR: Not around reproductive rights. There has been a local chapter of NOW for a very long time, and I think occasionally we would get a call if you need escorts. But they really weren&#8217;t very engaged in the reproductive rights concerns or at least not outwardly in terms of saying, &#8220;Oh there&#8217;s a clinic here. What can we do? Can we help?"
JW: And there weren&#8217;t-I mean, organized religion, I assume, for the most part here was not helpful, but I wonder about the Unitarian Church. Were there other--?
BM: I would say the Unitarian Church was the only one that--.
CR: But there was the rabbi from the beginning that was involved.
BM: Okay, Rabbi Derby. That&#8217;s who helped women get across state lines, minors too, in 1973-74, before there were any clinics here. But overall, there is a certain lack of support for abortion providers. Wouldn&#8217;t you say that? Yeah. Maybe Knoxville&#8217;s not ready for it yet. (laughs)
CR: Don&#8217;t want to get their hands dirty, and yet they&#8217;ve lived with us. Here we are in the Fort Sanders community. It&#8217;s an interesting kind of parable in some ways. It&#8217;s sort of a discrete building, but we&#8217;ve been right here at Fort Sanders right by campus for all these years. We still have patients that come in who are adults now and say, &#8220;Yeah, I remember coming by the clinic.&#8221; We have one woman who is now a public defender in a county outside of Knoxville. She said, &#8220;When I was in law school, I&#8217;d drive by this clinic and I&#8217;d roll my window down and yell at those yahoos and scream at them.&#8221; So people know us as the building that has those people standing outside. So we&#8217;ve been tolerated. It&#8217;s kind of interesting. We&#8217;ve been tolerated. But there really hasn&#8217;t been great support.
RM: More interest than support in the early years, in the late &#8217;70s, on campus than there is now. Students are much more conservative now than they used to be in the &#8217;70s. It&#8217;s a different atmosphere. They&#8217;re not activists the way they used to be, or that&#8217;s the way I see it.
CR: Yeah, and I talked about that when Jessie had interviewed me that we don&#8217;t see and the young people who have grown up in the environment of seeing abortion as murder and being inculcated by the language the forces and they don&#8217;t have the experience of what life is like without the choice and so there&#8217;s that taking for granted, at the same time being influenced by the language that they have been raised with. We&#8217;ve talked about that, Bernie, that initially women didn&#8217;t come in here and say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to murder my baby, but I have to have an abortion.&#8221; That language was just never a part of it and the emotional sort of vortex that has developed was not there. It was not to say that it wasn&#8217;t as serious or as important a decision or as emotionally difficult, but there wasn&#8217;t the drama along with it. Women made hard decisions. They lived with their reality. They came in, they had their abortions, and they left and continued on with their lives.   But now women, young women have heard, &#8220;Oh you&#8217;ll never be the same. You&#8217;re going to be traumatized. You&#8217;re going to be ruined for the rest of your life. You might never have babies. You&#8217;re going to get breast cancer.&#8221; All of these mistruths and misleading information that they have been bombarded with and have sort of internalized. They&#8217;re still getting abortions, but there&#8217;s so much more conflict because they have heard so many conflicting stories or not really stories, but information.
BM: And I think it is, years and years ago, we did an Alan Guttmacher, the research branch for Planned Parenthood polled, I guess, I can&#8217;t talk, and what we found is that across the nation, we were, as far as demographics, we were consistent with other clinics, but this clinic or clinics in the South, but this one particularly, when you were asked, &#8220;Do you consider yourself born again?&#8221; And across the country, I can&#8217;t remember what the percentages were, but across the country is was very low, but here it was extremely high. So patients are coming in here born again. They&#8217;ve accepted Jesus Christ as their savior and abortion is murder, and so they are extremely conflicted and yet they-
CR. They still make the choice.
JW: Can you say a little bit about what strategies you have for dealing with that? Because I guess abortion clinics, abortion becomes legal at the same time that the New Right and the evangelical Right is rising and becoming a major force. The evangelical movement is really developing. So your thoughts on that and how you&#8217;ve strategized or thought about how to speak to someone who says this is a sin or they&#8217;re born again? Since you have a different culture that you have to deal with?
RM: You have to deal with them one on one. You can&#8217;t deal with it as a strategy, but you can help a woman to deal with it. Look at her conflicts and see how important they are to her and what she thinks is true. You can try to give, put out facts that you believe to be facts, not in an argumentative way, but just say, &#8220;a lot of people have found&#8221; or &#8220;a lot of people feel&#8221; and &#8220;how do you feel?&#8221; And maybe she can come through that and maybe she can&#8217;t come through that.   But is that--?
BM: Certainly, for some patients, it was actually saying, &#8220;Do you believe God gave you a brain to make important decisions or does God just want you to not make decisions in your life?&#8221; Some people could take that and say, &#8220;Yeah, he did. Yeah, that is what I&#8217;m supposed to do. I do have four children at home, and I can&#8217;t take care of another one and I&#8217;m going to take responsibility for this decision.&#8221; But there&#8217;s others that were so-
RM: Well, I know that, I think you had a woman that was a psychologist that said she wished it was illegal so she wouldn&#8217;t have to make this decision.
BM: And a well-known psychologist in town. I sent her home because I said that she did have to make a decision, but she had to take responsibility for whatever decision she made and she came back.
RM: People are funny. They really are funny if you listen to them. (laughs)
BM: She came back a week later, and she was a totally different person. She really had worked through what she needed to. Most women who come to terms with making what they feel is a responsible decision in their lives, after an abortion, the biggest emotion is relief. It&#8217;s over with, they made a decision, and they need to move on. It doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s not sadness and you talk about the feelings that they might have. There&#8217;s sadness, a sense of emptiness. And again, it depends where they are. They may have been just rejected by a boyfriend, a husband, and they&#8217;re dealing with that loss as well. So yeah, we take everybody on an individual basis and try to get them to look at their reality and where they want to go.
CR: And yet again the religious conflict was not as strong in the early days.
BM: No.
CR: You didn&#8217;t see that same sort of true inner conflict or torment. I won&#8217;t even [say] conflict. Yes, maybe conflict, but not that torment that we seem to see more frequently now and again, I think it&#8217;s because of some organized Christian religions and particularly the Baptists spend a great part of the time in the pulpit talking about and against abortion and how you&#8217;ll go to hell if you have to have an abortion. These individuals are sitting in church week after week hearing that they&#8217;re a sinner and they&#8217;re going to hell, and yet they know they have to make this decision. So those are the women that you really see conflicted.   Now it&#8217;s interesting because here at the center, it&#8217;s the first time and the only time we have a minister who is our director of counseling. And I&#8217;ve got to tell you, it has really been impactful. Of course, her, she&#8217;s been avidly pro-choice her entire life. She&#8217;s in a very progressive and liberal Christian denomination that also supports women&#8217;s right to choose and reproductive rights and yet, one, spiritual life is very essential to her. Not that she&#8217;s seeking it, but when you find that person who is sort of sitting on the bench and you see they&#8217;re just about to break out sobbing and she&#8217;ll ask them a spiritual question and they&#8217;ll just break down and here it comes: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go to hell. I&#8217;ve been told my whole life I&#8217;m going to go to hell.&#8221; This has been somewhat difficult and conflicting for the staff, but she will sometimes pray with the patient if they want her to do. She won&#8217;t impose that on anybody, but she has asked several individuals who are clearly very emotional, upset, if they would like her to pray with them, and it just calms them down. She talks about God as a forgiving god and that woman just gets on the table. She says, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to do this now.&#8221; It&#8217;s the first time in our experience of just sort of really going right in and looking at that conflict.   RM: Well, you know, on our original advisory board, we had an advisory board of physicians, about ten or twelve, and Ray King was one. Did you know him? And he would frequently pray with patients. He did not do abortions, but he referred a lot of people to us because he had a relationship with Planned Parenthood and was very supportive. But he would pray with his patients.  CR: And it goes against all the grain especially because in the school system and what&#8217;s imposed, but I have to say it feels very appropriate at times here. And again, it's not forced on anybody. It&#8217;s not given that every person is going to have that experience, but that our director is sensitive enough to ask when she particularly senses that that person may need that and that that may be a comfort for them at that moment.   RM: It&#8217;s like Jerry Seinfeld said, &#8220;Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that.&#8221; (laughs)   CR: You know, frequently these days, I&#8217;ve been thinking about something that Sonya Johnson said, who was a radical activist back in the &#8217;90s. She&#8217;d been traveling around the country, and she&#8217;d come to Knoxville and I remember it was a fairly well-attended lecture that evening. And she spoke and she said, &#8220;Abortion should have never been legal.&#8221; And here&#8217;s this feminist standing there saying that, and I remember I wanted to leap across the room at her initially. I thought, &#8220;Let me just give her the space to finish what she has to say.&#8221;   And what she completed that thought with was that what they giveth, they can taketh away. And in looking at all that is going on right now and the ridiculous, ludicrous pieces of legislation and this very anti-woman campaign that we are in the thick of right now, Sonya&#8217;s words have been coming back to me all along because she said, &#8220;Right before Roe made abortion legal,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the movement was moving in the direction of all the underground forces that were in place. Women were taking care of women. Women were finding abortion services and there were more of those.&#8221; And we can talk about all the reasons why that doesn&#8217;t really work well and access, but we still have all those issues. Poor women still don&#8217;t really have access to abortion, can&#8217;t make choices. I had a woman this past week. She&#8217;s got three children. She was sixteen weeks and two days. So Saturday was absolutely [the] last day she could be here. With NAF funding, she still couldn&#8217;t come up with her portion of the abortion.   RM: [Did she come back?]  CR: She didn&#8217;t come back. We would have worked something out with her. We would have done something, and she didn&#8217;t show up on Saturday, and she was going to call NAF and see if they could also give her some more money and that we would work something out and scrape and find. But so poor women still don&#8217;t have, they don&#8217;t have access, easy access to abortion.  BM: And some states only have one abortion clinic.  CR: That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right. But Sonya&#8217;s words keep ringing back of me of there was a momentum of: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to take of it. We don&#8217;t need your help because what you dangle in front of us you can very easily take away from us.&#8221; And I&#8217;m thinking all these years later what truth there rings in that.  RM: Well, you know what I used to say was that it never had any place in statute law.  CR: I agree with that.  RM: It just never should have been there. If it needed to be dealt with in the common law, then that would be one thing, but who needs to sit there and write this thing out? It never should have been done.  CR: Because it was always available. In fact, there&#8217;s a woman in town who&#8217;s just written a novel and she came and consulted with us. And her novel takes place in the 1900s and she has a scene in there. This Italian immigrant woman comes to the US and she&#8217;s raped, and she gets pregnant and she&#8217;s in Chicago at this point. So Pamela has done all this research on abortion in the 1900s, and she came to me because we were looking for what kind of instruments would they have had and used and how would the abortion have been performed. She did just enormous, wonderful research, which she&#8217;s put in the book. It was all known and what she, in fact, our book [club] just had her. We read the book and invited her to come speak with us for our book group and this was a staggering statistic that I just didn&#8217;t realize, but she said in the 1900s, women had, on average, ten to twelve abortions during their reproductive years, legal procedures or there was no statutes.   Supporting what you were saying, Dick, there were no statutes on the book and there were those physicians or those people who provided abortions. It has always been in existence. It has always been a part of comprehensive women&#8217;s health care, and it was not a big deal. It was just the reality. Now those are pre-birth control days, but the clinic was just on the heels of birth control becoming legal in this country. Women didn&#8217;t have many choices, and they took care of business as they needed to.   But they sold pills. This was so fascinating. There was some herb or some pill that was used, and I&#8217;m forgetting the term. It was if you needed, if you were stocked up, some euphemism that sounded like you were either pregnant or you were constipated. I&#8217;m not sure which, but there was something you had to pass. And they were in pharmacies and women would just go in and ask for this particular pill and everybody knew what the code was for and they were given and said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t, come back and see us.&#8221; Because usually affiliated with that was somebody who they could connect with to have the procedure done.
JW: What&#8217;s the name of the book?
CR: When We Were Strangers, Pamela Schoenewaldt.
RM: When we were what?
CR: When We Were Strangers.
RM: Okay.
CR: Good reading.  JW: So I guess one other question I have is we&#8217;ve talked about the movement people, the people on the sidewalks and chaining themselves to the building and what-not, but what about the political battles in the state of Tennessee? How much have you felt like you had to engage thos,e or is that another arena that it&#8217;s too difficult to do your job here and feel like you have to be engaged in these political battles? Especially once, what is it, after Webster, the Webster decision that states get more control over abortion. Am I right about that? I&#8217;m not the expert.  CR: You are right about that, and in the past, I&#8217;d say eight, probably five to ten years, every year, there&#8217;s been over six hundred pieces of legislation introduced in state legislatures across this country.  JW: In Tennessee?
C: In state legislatures. This year alone, there&#8217;s probably about six hundred per state. It&#8217;s just gone amuck, again, some really outrageous legislation.
BM: But the Tennessee constitution affords a woman greater privacy than the federal. Is that right?
CR: That&#8217;s right.
BM: Yeah, okay. So what they&#8217;re trying to do in Tennessee, or have been trying to do, is to change the constitution, which is pretty hard to do. So at this point, if Roe v. Wade was overturned, it would still be legal in Tennessee.
CR: The women of Tennessee are guaranteed a right to their privacy and to an abortion. Now that has irked the conservative Right.
BM: Oh absolutely.
CR: Beyond belief, and they have been trying every year. Now you know that they just passed, the Senate just passed for the second year in a row the legislation. So as of 2014, it is going to referendum.
JW: The part of the state constitution-  (sound cuts off)
CR: There&#8217;s going to be statewide organizing so that we can be prepared before 2014 and get the message out. So that&#8217;s what we have to look forward to. They&#8217;ve been wanting to overturn that and change that and they&#8217;re well on their way now. So it will be left up to the voters at this point. So it is going to take a lot of organizing. It&#8217;s going to take a lot of work and we&#8217;ve been involved. We had a pro-choice coalition that was sort of running out of the center here. We had written a grant. What year was that? It was when Beth was still here because she ran the program for us, well, not for us, but it was a non-profit that we formed, but we had organized out of the clinic.
BM: I&#8217;d say &#8217;94, &#8217;95.
CR: Yeah, I think that&#8217;s correct. And we were active for a while, but during the Clinton years, it was really hard to keep people motivated. When administrations change and things sort of calm down for a while, it&#8217;s really difficult to keep people motivated and organized and so there was this huge sigh of relief. And we continued for, I think, another year or two and then nobody&#8217;s showing up at meetings and it&#8217;s piddling away. And we haven&#8217;t had a pro-choice organization since then. Through the Bush years, there hasn&#8217;t been anybody. There&#8217;s the one group in Oak Ridge who are all in their 70s and 80s now.
BM: I want to say they&#8217;re in their 90s now.
JW: And are they still meeting?
CR: I don&#8217;t know if they are.
BM: I don&#8217;t think so.
CR: But they were until fairly-
JW: I think I saw their website and it hadn&#8217;t been updated for years.
CR: For a long time, but they did continue for a very long time and really until maybe about five or six years ago maybe.
BM: Yeah, but it&#8217;s people pre-Roe v. Wade that were active and stayed active. Since that, young people today, they take it for granted. They really don&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s going to be overturned at any point and that we&#8217;d go back to illegal abortions.
RM: And it certainly wouldn&#8217;t affect them.
CR: Right, right.
BM: Yeah. Just like I had a patient who was running, was it Gore-Lieberman, and we had Gore signs in the recovery room and she said, &#8220;Oh well, I guess you&#8217;d be for Gore.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;And so should you.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Oh, well, no, no. This is my last abortion.&#8221; And I just wanted to wring her neck. You&#8217;ve exercised this right three times and you&#8217;re going to vote for Bush? So people are funny, and they don&#8217;t see it as: &#8220;In my case, it&#8217;s okay.&#8221; It&#8217;s amazing how many people in counseling sessions that they feel like this woman, this woman, this woman&#8217;s not reacting right: &#8220;They should be taking this more seriously&#8221; or &#8220;they should be doing it this way.&#8221; And feeling like they&#8217;re the only ones that really have a good enough reason to have an abortion. There&#8217;s some judgment.
CR: Yes.
BM: You&#8217;ve run the-
CR: Oh absolutely.
BM: Judgmental people who feel like, &#8220;In my case, it&#8217;s okay. In yours, it&#8217;s-
CR: It&#8217;s not.
BM: It&#8217;s not.
CR: As well as some of the anti-choice people who-
BM: Picket.
CR: Picket, but have on occasion used a service. It doesn&#8217;t seem to change their perspective at all.
BM: They&#8217;re back picketing.
CR: And: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a choice. I had to make this decision.&#8221;
BM: &#8220;But nobody else should have that right.&#8221;
CR: And what about all the other women? It&#8217;s like constantly dealing with those contradictions that, well, I think we use humor sometimes to deal with. We confront many of those. It&#8217;s not that we let those opportunities pass. And it&#8217;s a difficult thing because I feel strongly that, yes, we&#8217;re here to provide quality services, non-judgmental services, and yet it is also crucial and important in our role to educate. And if somebody&#8217;s kind of in their own emotional crisis, is that the right time? But yet, you can&#8217;t lose that opportunity and so I think we&#8217;re gentle in our approach, but forthright at times when those sort of situations come up to say, &#8220;You know, this is why it&#8217;s so important to have this choice.&#8221; The number of times, it&#8217;s countless times that women are either getting their ultrasound or when they&#8217;re in counseling, saying, &#8220;I never thought I&#8217;d have to make this decision.&#8221; And it&#8217;s a ripe opportunity, and I can&#8217;t keep my mouth buttoned when I say that, to say to them, &#8220;Yes, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to keep this a legal right because nobody ever expects to be here. Nobody thinks about having an abortion. Nobody wants to have an abortion. Nobody plans on having an abortion.&#8221;
JW: And then it seems like you&#8217;re up against so much because people, I mean, I grew up in the area and as a middle schooler was going to a Southern Baptist church where my grandparents went. In school, the sex [education] is all about abstinence. At church, the narrative you&#8217;re told is women are, that they shouldn&#8217;t get themselves in this situation in the first place and anything that happens to them is God&#8217;s plan or their fault. And that&#8217;s happening on a daily, weekly basis. So it seems like you&#8217;re up against so much in terms of that narrative.
BM: The multiplicity of that.
JW: Yeah. So do you see any efforts to change that around here?
RM: I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with that. It&#8217;s just that there are loopholes that people fall through and they need help. Abstinence absolutely works, but on the other hand, in the aggregate, it doesn&#8217;t seem to.
JW: Well, and also I&#8217;m being kind about the narrative. It&#8217;s pretty sexist, too, and I feel like I can say that because I was bombarded with it [as a teenager] in the &#8217;90s in the cultural wars.
RM: Yes.
JW: Like women, young girls are taught that they&#8217;re not really valuable, they can&#8217;t really make decisions, and there have to be all these rules in place.
BM: But then my son, oh, he might get in a little trouble here and there.
JW: If anything happens, it&#8217;s the girl&#8217;s fault.
BM: Right, right, and that is our sexist culture.
RM: We need all the self-worth we can get that&#8217;ll get us through that.
CR: And that&#8217;s a sad thing because that doesn&#8217;t occur in the school systems very much.  I was just at the school board meeting where Planned Parenthood has been creamed and raked over the coals and this whole demonization of Planned Parenthood both at the local level, the state level, and the federal level. In fact, I just got a message from Lamar Alexander. I was just pulling my hair out and screaming.
BM: Oh me too, me too.
C: And then when I tried to write back again, and I couldn&#8217;t reply. So I&#8217;ve got to find his message, his email, to do a reply.
BM: But (69:55).
CR: I know.
JW: And what are they--? They&#8217;re attacking Planned Parenthood?
CR: Well, they&#8217;re trying to defund Planned Parenthood at the federal level with HR-7, which was just passed.
BM: Yeah, they&#8217;re all pro-life and every letter I&#8217;ve written to Lamar or any of them-
CR: Corker, all of them.
BM: They&#8217;ll send you this form letter that they&#8217;re pro-life.
CR: &#8220;I voted for this position, and I&#8217;ll always vote against abortion.&#8221; I mean, Duncan, I just got a letter from, and I think I&#8217;m going to go to his office and speak. So yes, there is organizing on the state level. The Planned Parenthood meeting at the school board was just the most ludicrous thing I have ever experienced of recent. It was on a first call, first come basis. So the first thirteen speakers, which foolishly, they gave everybody five minutes. Well, Marsha and I were signed up to talk and we never got to it because by eight thirty and I had to get home or the dog was going to burst. But the Planned Parenthood, the teens were there, some of them spoke. They were elegant. There are still some grassroots sort of movements. The Planned Parenthood teen program is fabulous. They&#8217;ve done some great things. In fact, they&#8217;ve just had an art exhibit for first Friday out on Market Square, art representations of choice. And they&#8217;ve got a good active group of kids. They all showed up at the school board meeting. As I said, a couple of them did get to talk.   But all of the anti- people, they were talking. They had all read the same script. They had obviously gotten online and throughout the country, the &#8220;how to attack Planned Parenthood.&#8221; There must be a website that says, &#8220;These are the points that you use.&#8221; They were talking about Kinsey and the Kinsey Report from the early 1900s. That&#8217;s what they were still citing as why Planned Parenthood should be undermined because he was a pedophile and he was a this and he was a that. They were still teaching people to have sex. It was just, it was vile. It was so difficult to sit and listen to the same misleading information and mistruths and misrepresentations that are happening.   And the school board backed off. They had actually made their decision before the meeting, which was about Planned Parenthood has been doing, as we finally have been able to get some sex education in the school system and not only the abstinence-only programs. So Planned Parenthood, the curriculum had been approved by the school board. What occurred was one teacher made the mistake of forgetting to have the kids take home the signed letter for permission to participate in the program because it was still considered optional and so the letter didn&#8217;t go home. The kid sat there. Again, this curriculum had been approved by the school board. It was just basic sexual education, birth control, anatomy, a little anatomy, a little physiology. Nothing very risky at all, nothing terribly progressive. And the daughter went home and told the parents and so this whole organized group about &#8220;we don&#8217;t want our kids exposed to Planned Parenthood and they&#8217;re the largest abortion provider in this country.&#8221; And it just went on from there.  So the school board backed off. They were going to hold this public meeting and they were going to make a decision. They made the decision before the meeting and then still they let everybody come and speak and so they said they would continue with the contract for Planned Parenthood through the school year and they will no longer allow outside groups to come in to do education. So now they&#8217;re going to leave it to the teachers to provide the sex ed curriculum. Now it was very clear that many teachers are uncomfortable in discussing this information. [Are they] the best educators? Are these the best people? Would you not bring in the experts who have spent a lot of time on research, gathering good resources. So it&#8217;s an interesting outcome. Of course, with that comes that the anti- and the abstinence-only agendas will also no longer be allowed to come into the school system.   A friend&#8217;s sixteen-year-old daughter came home and told us that this gentleman who had come in to do a portion of the curriculum told all the girls, &#8220;If you&#8217;ve had sex, you&#8217;re all whores.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t say a word to the boys. The same sexist attitude from your experience in the educational system in the &#8217;90s still exists strong and loud. She was horrified. She comes from a fairly progressive family. They talk about things. They understand. She tried to raise her hand to say, &#8220;Excuse me? Why are only the girls whores? What about the boys who are having sex?&#8221; The guy completely ignored her, and then he went on and did his whole anti-choice talk, anti-sex talk, and did a whole sort of religious stint of them. She came home and she said, &#8220;Now I&#8217;m horrified by this,&#8221; and her parents were fairly horrified, but will the same reaction occur in the school system and by the school board to say, &#8220;Well, this is offensive to me, just as you might consider Planned Parenthood&#8217;s curriculum offensive.&#8221; Where is that equal weight? It&#8217;s just not there. Just like we have an anti-choice, choose life license tag, and we cannot have a pro-choice license tag in this tag. So the same contradiction, the same weighted perspective is still there.  BM: I really do think things have gotten worse than they were in the &#8217;70s, definitely. We used to be invited to talk in schools.  CR: Yes, we were.
BM: We certainly wouldn&#8217;t be now. Yeah, things have gotten worse. We refuse to teach responsible, sex education, which leads people to not be responsible in making decisions.
CR: In their decision-making.
BM: Yeah.
CR: That&#8217;s right.
BM: It&#8217;s much better-
RM: They don&#8217;t make decisions, bingo.

BM: If you get carried away in the back seat of the car and have sex than to plan on it and to be responsible about it. And I think that we&#8217;re really failing our youngsters. People in France and Germany just look at us like, &#8220;What are you doing over there?&#8221; They teach responsible sex education and their teens and young adults are responsible and use birth control and protect themselves against STDs. We are failing miserably.
CR: We are, we are.
RM: Yeah, it&#8217;s not controversial.
BM: What, over there?
RM: Yeah.
BM: No.
CR: Right, right.
JW: This is a huge question, but how do you explain that shift from the 70s, from the sexual revolution and birth control becoming available and it seems like things would have gone the direction of, well, this is something we should talk about and these should be decisions that we&#8217;re making responsibly to what it is now?
RM: It would seem to me that it rides on the back of our stupid politics. We&#8217;ve come, just finished with a president that didn&#8217;t believe in science, that couldn&#8217;t talk straight. There wasn&#8217;t any question that these things were wrong. You don&#8217;t have to think about it. The sentences are all about three or four words. And people followed along. They bought that stuff. None of us are thinking anymore, it would seem. We&#8217;re all arguing, but it&#8217;s a polarized kind of a thing and reason doesn&#8217;t have all that loud a voice. Reason shouldn&#8217;t have to.
BM: But the far Right has a very, very loud voice.

RM: Yes.
BM: How can we possibly pick Palin as the spokesperson for abstinence only when she just had a baby?   CR: Right.  BM: That&#8217;s who they picked as their spokesperson.
CR: What kind of mixed message does that send?
BM: Exactly, exactly.
CR: I think as we have seen in this country in particular, the pendulum swings, and so we sort of went after the [19]60s and the &#8217;70s and we sort of began--. Then we had a little. It hasn&#8217;t been swinging very far left. As we see, the Democratic Party has become so much more centralized in its position. This friend was visiting recently who has lived here and is now living overseas again, and we spoke during the visit and she said, &#8220;You know, I&#8217;ve never heard you so down.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;You know, we kind of knew that we&#8217;d have the backlash for Obama as president and everything that that stands for.&#8221; I said, &#8220;So we&#8217;re right now right in the middle of that backlash, and it&#8217;s really painful.&#8221;   It is a really painful time to be experiencing all that we are. The Bush years were hard enough. Surviving those eight years of really regressing twenty, twenty-five years in terms of the environment, in terms of education, in terms of women and children, in terms of reproductive rights, but somehow we maintained, and then it was hopeful with Obama&#8217;s presidency and look at the backlash now. Look how that pendulum has just swung in the other direction in the midterm elections. Now can we swing back? I think this country always does some, but it seems like we keep swinging more and more this way and we&#8217;re never really quite coming back to make that full arch in that pendulum. It&#8217;s kind of a disturbing time to be engaged and alive.  RM: In our generation, it&#8217;s very disturbing and you feel like that there&#8217;s not much our generation can do about it and the younger, they&#8217;ve lost their, they&#8217;re more conservative, the people coming out of college and going to work. They&#8217;re not ready to pick up the ball the way we would like to see them pick it up.   CR: Yeah, and so what that will mean, I don&#8217;t know.   BM: And maybe we&#8217;ll have to lose some rights to get people fighting again. I don&#8217;t know, but that&#8217;s part of my retiring was you get tired of fighting the fight. You want somebody else to pick up the ball and fight the fight.   CR: And you get tired of reinventing the same wheel all the time, having to fight the same battles. You think you&#8217;ve made progress. Okay, let&#8217;s move on to other issues. Let&#8217;s really talk about women&#8217;s rights and women&#8217;s equality in this world, not just based on having the right to decide what your family size is, which really is a matter of determining what your economic status is going to be in this world because the truth of the matter, the whole abortion issue is not really just about family. It&#8217;s really about women&#8217;s position in the world and the girl effect is a true effect that women who have fewer children, their economic standing in the world and they move themselves out of poverty and they actually improve the lives for themselves and their children and set examples for their children so that they can improve their lives. And we keep women in a position where they have no right to make a decision, which keeps them in the poverty cycle. We&#8217;re not creating any changes.  RM: Well, you can&#8217;t be a professional woman if you can't control your fertility.  CR: You can&#8217;t.  RM: There&#8217;s an awful lot of things that are closed off.   BM: And that is what abortion&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s not about babies and children and taking care-  CR: It is.  RM: Yeah, it&#8217;s about putting women back in their place.  CR: That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right.   BM: And that&#8217;s very, very frustrating. You would feel like that we gained a lot of rights in the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s, and they&#8217;re trying to take them away. To hear a man say that a woman needs a sonogram to know what she&#8217;s dealing with or that she needs to wait twenty-four hours or forty-eight hours is appalling to me. Or just when I saw those six or eight men signing away against the so-called partial birth abortion-  CR:  With big grins on their faces.   BM: With big grins on their face, all men, I think there is something really truly wrong with this picture.  RM: And there is. It&#8217;s horrible. How dare they?   JW: I don&#8217;t want to take up your whole afternoon, but this is great. So what would your advice be to a younger generation? What do people need to be doing? What are the next steps?  BM: Well, my son said to me, I said, &#8220;Tom, you come from people who&#8217;ve tried to influence the counseling, women&#8217;s issues. Your father&#8217;s always been for children in poverty. Dick has always fought and Dick&#8217;s parents have always been fighting for something.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;So why are you a salesperson?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Mom, I have seen you dealing with pregnant women all my life, okay, and reproductive issues.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;And you&#8217;re just like you&#8217;re spinning on a wheel.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;And Dad, I&#8217;ve seen him deal with abused children and there are still a lot of abused children and he&#8217;s spinning on a wheel.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Why would I want to do that?&#8221; In some ways, I think a lot of young people feel that way. Do you see people activists?  CR: I do see some, yes, and it&#8217;s uplifting. I meet some young women here who [are part of] a small group on campus that are involved and the Women&#8217;s Coordinating Council still exists and they sponsor some things. Through Community Shares, we just had Circle of Change, which are awards given to people who are doing important things, activists in the community. And they always have an award for a young person, and there was Isabelle got it last year for her work for baking, which she was the youngest at eleven who ever received an award. But the gentleman who received it this year, he&#8217;s twenty-five. He&#8217;s an African American man who&#8217;s very involved and engaged in organizing the community that he lives in, helping young people get job skills, and kind of particularly for young black men to develop a sense about community and job involvement. So I do see, but it&#8217;s sparse. It is sparse. There was always an active pro-choice group. I don&#8217;t see that. The war--. I&#8217;ve been involved in activities around the war in Afghanistan, and it&#8217;s all us old folks that are there. There are some young people there. I don&#8217;t know what it will take. And certainly, is UNC campus--?  BM: I was going to ask you that.  CR: Fairly conservative? There&#8217;s always a small faction.  JW: I would say the students are much more liberal than UT students. Obama overwhelmingly was supported at UNC to the point that they didn&#8217;t even need any more activists on the ground. They would send people to different cities and counties. But there is Feminists for Life. I just saw this organization on campus. They were having a big meeting. Those groups still have--. I think the kind of day to day students that you run into come from liberal and more progressive families and have adopted those politics, but the actual meetings and the more active students do seem to be the more conservative students. So they&#8217;re bringing in speakers, this whole western civilization thing, the Students for Western Civilization, which is basically a white supremacist group.  BM: The anti-Muslim.  RM: It&#8217;s basically what?  BM: A white supremacist group.   RM: Okay.  JW: Yeah, celebrating white-  CR: So the whole anti-immigration, anti-everything, I&#8217;m sure.  JW: Right.  RM: Okay.  JW: With an academic spin on it, but still it&#8217;s not a great, not a great thing. But then I meant to go to this Feminists for Life meeting because I just wanted to see how are they framing all of these issues. They look back to the late 1800s, early 1900s feminists, early suffragists, who, some of them were opposed to abortion, but I&#8217;m not even really sure if that, if the history that they&#8217;re telling is all that accurate and it certainly doesn&#8217;t reflect a contemporary context. So I&#8217;m not sure, and I didn&#8217;t go to the meeting in the end. I wasn&#8217;t able. So there are groups like that, but I would say there --. We have the Carolina Women&#8217;s Center, which is really strong and students are involved in that. But then there&#8217;s a lot of the same issues. Yeah, I heard the numbers on rape recently. It&#8217;s still very high. Date rape is still very high. There&#8217;s still not a lot of education around those issues. So I don&#8217;t know.  CR: And the abortion rate is still high for a developed country. So where is the education going? What progress have we truly made and are we going to lose much more ground before things begin to improve?  RM: If we look politically or with people that want to frustrate us, there&#8217;s an awful lot of people spinning their wheels, people moving in opposite directions. So there&#8217;s not much progress. We&#8217;re being torn down as fast as we could possibly build up and it keeps us in one place, the same way with the sex education, the same way with--. It&#8217;s certainly all over our Congress. We are not moving in a straight line at all.  BM: Yeah, if we&#8217;re fighting evolution all over again, you&#8217;d think how can we move forward if that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at? And science.  CR: You feel like you&#8217;re on a treadmill.   RM: It is a treadmill and lots of people want it to be.  CR: Right, and you&#8217;re right there because if you keep us reacting-  RM: Keep us frustrated.  CR: Then it&#8217;s hard to be proactive if you're constantly reacting to another attack or another, yeah.  RM: Yes, yes.   BM: And Obama could do so much more if he wasn&#8217;t defending his birthplace. He&#8217;s being attacked on so many levels. I have complete respect for the man after watching what he did last week [announcing the capture and killing of Osama Bin Ladin] and doing it in such a, oh, what&#8217;s the word I&#8217;m looking for? He just was-  CR: With integrity, I guess.  BM: With integrity, yeah.  RM: Strength, integrity, restraint, all those things.   BM: And what an incredible week he had.  CR: Which, and he&#8217;s not let down. I don&#8217;t know if we want to get off on talking about Obama, but it&#8217;s the politics of our time. He&#8217;s this sort of, yes, he&#8217;s made many concessions, but there are some things that he is standing strong on and one of those is the defunding of Planned Parenthood. He says, &#8220;Absolutely no.&#8221;  RM: But there are great efforts to neutralize him.  CR: That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right.   RM: There are great efforts to neutralize anything that's trying to move.  CR: Health care reform. We actually have health care reform in this country. It&#8217;s going to be slow to come, it&#8217;s in stages, and as long as they don&#8217;t keep trying to knock out each next stage, he actually passed that without a single Republican vote. That&#8217;s a pretty remarkable thing.  RM: It is for a political feat.  CR: Now he&#8217;s going to be under attack constantly.  RM: But as a program, I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll ever see it or not.  CR: That&#8217;s right.  BM: And they&#8217;re trying to derail it with abortion. That to me, the Republicans ran on a job, job, job, job, and all they&#8217;ve done is-  CR: Pass abortion legislation or attempt to pass abortion legislation.  BM: That&#8217;s incredible.  JW: Did you ever anticipate that, that abortion would become the issue that was used to debate things like health care reform?  RM: No.   BM: Never.  CR: I didn&#8217;t, didn&#8217;t see that coming.  RM: I really did believe that we could make progress and then when we started in &#8217;75, we would be so far along the road by 2000, and then by 2011, further along the road. We&#8217;re no further along the road because of the controversy and constantly called in to defend ourselves.   BM: Well, and that abortion would be involved in politics at all.  RM: Yes. It has no place there.  BM: I would never have foreseen that.  CR: Not to the degree it&#8217;s used as a wedge in almost every piece of legislation, whether it&#8217;s about water, the environment, completely non-health-care-related issues, but it&#8217;s just really being used as the wedge issue for any piece of legislation that they want to pass.  RM: And it just, the smoke makes it impossible to do anything to do anything else.   CR: And so we just continue to plug away at what we do. (laughs) Remind women on a regular basis this is an important right to maintain. Don&#8217;t bury your head in the sand. It is important how you vote. Your voice does count. Again, without shoving it down people&#8217;s throats during their time of need, but it's the opportunity we have and we just, we have to discuss it. We try to put current related issues or topics on a bullet board out here because family members are sitting through here and when there&#8217;s a particularly contentious piece of legislation or like during health care reform, we posted some articles and some information to help continue to do that educational work to say, &#8220;What you think and what you say can make a difference.&#8221;   JW: Any last reflections on the place of this clinic in this community, what you think that you&#8217;ve been able to do here and what you&#8217;ve been able to provide? We&#8217;ll end on a positive note.  RM: I think we&#8217;ve helped a lot of people. I really do. And I think the progress we&#8217;ve made is one person at a time and that may be all we can do, but that&#8217;s okay because I don&#8217;t know how many charts are down there now. Twenty thousand, twenty-five thousand? There&#8217;s a lot.   C: And we have surveys, the feedback that we get from people, and I think I mentioned that-  BM: Save them for me.  CR: I think the really disturbing piece for me is that women expect to be judged from all around them even when they come here, and over and over again on the surveys, they say, &#8220;I was treated with respect. I expected to be judged. I wasn&#8217;t. I had enormous support. This was the most nonjudgmental environment I&#8217;ve ever been in.&#8221; So that our philosophy and what you two established for the services to be here still exists in that way and that women experience that on a regular basis.  RM: Either that or they missed the whole point. (laughs)  BM: I once ran into a patient waiting in line in a bathroom in a restaurant. She said, &#8220;I know you. I know you. I know you from somewhere.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; She said, &#8220;And I feel so close to you. I feel close to you.&#8221; And I wanted to say, &#8220;Yeah, I held your hand through an abortion,&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t want to say that. But the feeling that that&#8217;s what she left her with is that somehow we connected and that&#8217;s what it's all about or was, is for me.  RM: She thought you were Carol Burnett. (laughs)   BM: People used to ask me, &#8220;Do you know who you look like?&#8221; But yeah, I think that over the years, we helped a lot of people.   CR: And we still do, yeah, and women do feel that. The thank you notes, the surveys that come back, people looking you in the eye and having one of the most intimate experiences other than perhaps childbirth that they have, and say, &#8220;Thank you. I couldn&#8217;t have done this without your support.&#8221;   RM: We can be a component of the women&#8217;s movement, but we can&#8217;t be a women&#8217;s movement, and thank God there is a women&#8217;s movement and it needs to be strong and-  C: Revitalized.   RM: Yeah, yeah.   JW: Any last thoughts or reflections?  RM: It&#8217;s been great.  JW: Thank you. This has been really wonderful.  BM: You&#8217;re a good interviewer.  JW: Well, thank you.  CR: Yeah, and again, thanks for this project.
