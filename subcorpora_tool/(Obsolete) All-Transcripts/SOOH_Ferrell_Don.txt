 Finchum  Ferrell  Today is March 10, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library, and we   re conducting an oral  history project called Spotlighting Oklahoma. Today we   re going to  focus a little bit on Henry Bellmon, former governor and U.S. senator.  First Republican governor of Oklahoma, right?  That   s right.  We   re in Chandler, Oklahoma to speak with Don Ferrell. Thank you for  having me today.  Thank you for coming.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little bit about yourself, like where you  were born and your education, and then we   ll work our way forward.  Great. I was born in Oklahoma City and grew up there. My wife did,  too. After a three year enlistment in the Air Force, I came back and went  to Oklahoma State University. I got a degree in journalism there in 1953  and worked several newspapers. In 1962 we bought the newspaper in  Chandler. We   ve lived here since then. We had it for twenty-six years  and sold out. In the meantime, during all this, I had a career in the  National Guard, and I also found time to work for Henry Bellmon during  his first term as governor and during his second term, and for a short  while during his twelve years in the  US  Senate. That   s how we got  here.  Did you grow up on a farm or in town?  I grew up in town. My wife grew up on a dairy farm. We got over here, I  was trying to find a farm, and she told me once, said,    Hey, the only  reason I married you was to get off the farm.    (Laughter) I don   t think  5  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  that   s correct, but that   s what she said.  What prompted you to go to OSU, versus OU?  Well, I don   t know. (Laughs) I had a friend that was my roommate up  there my first year or so, and he went up there because his girlfriend was  going there. He was later married to her for fifty years, so I tagged  along. But I met Sally at Oklahoma City University (OCU). I went to a  summer  class . After three years in the Air Force, I was in a hurry to get  out in the world. I met her at a seven o   clock class at OCU one summer.  And did you always want to be a journalist?  No, I wanted to be an engineer, and they told me in not too subtle terms  that I was really not cut out to be an engineer, and so I changed to  journalism.  And you graduated from OSU in    53?  I got my degree in    53. I actually left in    52. I had enough credits   well,  I needed six hours, and they let me work that out in some field courses,  and so I got my degree in 1953.  It was Oklahoma A M at that time, wasn   t it?  A M College, yes it was. They offered me a new diploma if I   d write  them a letter, but I never did do that.  Did you have any favorite professors?  Yes, I had several of them. They   re all deceased in the fifty or sixty  years since, but yes, I had some great teachers.  Was Paul Miller there at that time?  No, he was way ahead of me as a student. He was back in the    20s, I  think.  Okay. That name just comes to mind with journalism.  It   s Paul Miller School of Journalism, I believe.  Yes. Once you graduated, then you moved here?  Well, there were a number of years in between, about ten years before  we moved here. In the fall of 1962, we bought the local newspaper, and  6  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  we operated that for twenty-six years, and we   re still here.  At some point you were a senator, too?  Yes. In 1966 I ran for the State Senate. The gentleman that had it for  thirty-two years quit, and I was the first Republican elected to the State  Senate from this district since 1912. Shirley Bellmon was my campaign  manager. My district was Lincoln, Logan, and Noble County. Noble  County is where the Bellmons lived, so Shirley helped me up there.  Let   s back up. How did you meet the Bellmons?  About 1960 or    61, he was the State Republican Chairman. In the spring,  he announced he was going to run for governor, and I went to this little  neighborhood coffee. And Sally was at home with   we had little babies  then   and she was at home and said,    Well, what did you think?    I said,     Well,      no Republican had ever been elected governor. I said,    Well,  he doesn   t have a chance, but we   ve got to help him.    (Laughs) So we  did and he won. During the campaign, at the end of the campaign was  when we moved over here. But I got out and knocked doors in  Oklahoma City before we left over there. And in the meantime, we  bought the paper, came over here. We were here on election night. It  was a big deal.  Sure. So you were here election night? You weren   t with him when he  was   ?  No, all I did over in that campaign was door-to-door stuff. We were not  in on the big victory party.   Were you  a little surprised that he was going to win or did you have a  good  feeling ?  Well, it was one of those things   everybody liked him. He   s not only a  smart politician, but he was a lucky politician. A big deal was sales tax.  Bill Atkinson was the Democrat candidate, and he ran on a campaign of  raising taxes, raising the income tax. They ran a joint meeting, a forum,  and somebody asked Mr. Atkinson,    What will you do if you can   t get  the legislature to vote to raise taxes?    He said,    Well, then we   ll have to  stamp out graft and corruption in state government.    (Laughs) It was just  a lucky thing that he said that, but Henry hammered him on sales taxes  the rest of the campaign, and he couldn   t very well back out of that     Mr. Atkinson couldn   t back out of that. So that was a big part of it. Then  there also had been an awful fight in the Democrat Party in the primary  in the governor   s race, so he benefitted from that. It was a good  campaign.  7  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Did you travel much across the state with him or just mostly in those  three counties?  Oh, I didn   t do it at all the first  time . I was over here up to my eyeballs  trying to figure out how to run a country newspaper. I didn   t do anything  that first campaign after we left Oklahoma City.  While he was in his governorship the first time, anything specific you  remember, special things or   ?  Well, in 1965, fall of 1965, Robert Haught was his press secretary  during the campaign, and then during his governor   s term they started a  new agency, the War on Poverty, I think it was. The governor decided  Bob Haught ought to run that. I had a call from a guy named Truman  Branscum, who was later the highway director, and he ran for Congress  one time and was probably elected, but got counted out. He called me  and wanted to know who I thought might be a press secretary for the  governor. I thought of a friend of mine, down in Southeast Oklahoma, a  newspaper publisher who I   d gone to OSU with. I said,    He   d be a really  good one.    He was a longtime Republican. And so I didn   t hear any  more about it.  One Saturday morning, I was out doing yard work, and we   d never  really known the governor, first term, to speak to, and Sally came out  and hollered at me. I was wanted on the phone. She said,    It   s the  governor     (Laughs) And it was. He wanted to know if I wanted to come  to work as press secretary. A couple of days later, he had been to a  Labor Day  parade , and he flew in and had lunch with us out at the  farm. So I agreed to do that on kind of a part-time basis. I had a pretty  much full-time job here, running this newspaper. That   s how that came  about.  Part-time, so did you get paid for it?  Yes, I got paid  12,000 a year. Well, it was supposed to be part-time, but  part-time never materialized. (Laughs) So I ran the road and     Drove back and forth?  Yes, and I hired a couple more people at the newspaper to kind of pick  up the slack.  Did you have an office at the capitol?  Yes.  8  Finchum  Finchum  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Did you?  Yes. I kind of drew a little chart here. You asked me in your preliminary  notes, where was my office. It was right down the hall of the governor   s  secretary, and I was right next door to there. You had access in the back  door anytime you wanted. Henry, he knew the importance of having a  press secretary. Well, he wanted to call it a news secretary. He thought  press was kind of an antiquated term since the electronic media was just  getting started pretty well. So, anyway, I was right second door down  there and had access in the back door. Anytime I needed to talk to him,  I   d just walk in. The governor   s office was in the southeast corner of the  capitol on the second floor.  You would commute every day.  Yes, just about every day. It   s about a forty minute run in there  from  Chandler, Oklahoma to the capitol  and gives you time to think. I spent a  lot of years running back and forth.  Do you have a couple of highlights from that period?  Yes. One highlight, there was a governor   s conference in Tokyo. Most  of the governors flew in first class on Pan-Am or something, and he  decided   I was in the Air National Guard at the time. Our unit flew  back   it was our mission covering the Pacific   well, covering the  world. We regularly flew into Japan, there, Tokyo, regular navigation  trips. They hauled cargo over and that was during the early parts of  Vietnam, and they   d go in there. He decided he wanted to ride over on  an Air Guard mission. And the governor   s office decided I ought to  accompany him. So we flew to Hawaii, and we saw where he was out  there during World War II when he was in the Fourth Marine Division.  The high point of the whole trip, in fact, almost one of the high points in  my forty-year military career, was visiting Iwo Jima with Henry  Bellmon. He won a Silver Star there, and he was tied down on the beach  during that awful battle. I got to walk the beach and visit the top of  Mount Suribachi and have it all explained by somebody who had been  there. It was quite a trip. It made quite an impression on me to see. I  don   t know how we ever won that battle.  Special times with him.  Yes, it was a very special time.  And the only governor to do that, probably.  9  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Yes, I   m sure he was the only governor that ever served in that battle on  Iwo Jima.  And to get to Japan, this time that way, too.  Yes. There might be others that did, but the others we saw there, they  came out first class. Henry wore a   oh, I   ve got a picture of it in here     a flight suit. We left Iwo Jima and flew straight to Japan, and the public  relations guys that met us there, they were just upset. Here he was  instead of getting out of the airplane with the TV and wearing a suit and  vest and tie and all, he got out wearing a grubby flight suit where we   d  been all day long hiking around Iwo Jima. (Laughter)  How long were you there?  I was just there a couple of days, and then we headed back through  Wake Island and all the way back here. He stayed for a weeklong  conference. I don   t remember how he got back, but we didn   t bring him  back.  What were some of the issues you recall from those days, that particular  time, what he was trying to do?  Actually, that was when we had biennial sessions. The legislature just  met every other year, and so it was kind of quiet on the legislative front  then. There were some of the same issues back then as there are now     teacher pay, retirement situation. But during his term, he did a number of  important things. He established the merit system, the Vo-Tech system,  which is a model for the whole country. That   s so highly regarded  everywhere. The State Employees Retirement System was started then.  But probably the best thing was the merit system, which I remember  how it used to be when   the day after   I used to drive to work when I  lived in Oklahoma City, drive down past the capitol, down to the Daily  Oklahoman. I worked there. And the day after the governor   s race when  you   d drive through the capitol complex, every car would have the  winning governor   s bumper sticker on there. (Laughs) It was pretty well  a cleaned house after they got a new governor if the ones that didn   t  support the right people. And it   s the same way for the legislative  leaders. They could just clean house, anybody they didn   t like. It   s not  that way now. I think that   s an improvement. Some people might argue  that it   s not, but the state merit system was a long step towards  stabilizing the professional work force.  Did he have an uphill battle being the Republican?  10  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Yes, but he did pretty well. He knew how to work with people. There   s  so many other factions, I found out during my legislative tenure. It   s not  just all partisan politics that divide. That   s there for sure, but there is the  rural versus urban split. That makes people get on different sides.  There   s the east versus west, Tulsa versus Oklahoma City, just all kinds  of divisions there that don   t depend on party labels.  Do you have any stories to tell about the governor   s house?  Well, the second term   my wife is a preservation fanatic, almost, and  she and Shirley did a lot to restore some of the original look to the  governor   s house. That was in the second term. They took tile up and  exposed the original 1915 tile, lovely tile. And they found there were a  lot of cabinets in the governor   s mansion, kind of a little den, and the  glass doors had been taken off. They found some in the governor   s  office. They found some in the basement of the mansion. A lot of that  was restored, and they had a good time doing that, trying to get it back to  looking like  when it was built . That was the highlight of that part of it.  When his first term was up     You could only serve one term. They voted   I believe I   m correct on  this   in 1966 at the election. There was a constitutional amendment to  allow governors to serve two terms instead of one. Nobody thought it   d  pass, but I think because of Henry Bellmon   s service as a governor and  the high level of confidence he brought to that office that it was adopted.  So that happened there. Texas voted at the same time, but I don   t believe  it carried there. John Connelly was the governor at that time.  At one point, he appointed Hannah Atkins to serve?  Yes, I think she was in the House, then.  And she   s a Democrat?  Yes.  But he appointed her?  Yes, he appointed her Secretary of State during the second term. I think  she   d worked in the state library system up to that point. She had served  in the legislature, and I believe that   s correct. She worked in the state  library. His chief of staff or his legislative assistant   the first term was a  Democrat, a former legislator. He was practical and wanted to get things  done. He picked good people. He had a lot of Democrats working for  him the first time.  11  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Crossed party lines with no trouble.  No problem at all.  Do you know what went into his thinking to run for senator?  Well, we   d talked about it when he was governor the first time, we had  meetings and talked about it. What led him to not run for senator  at the  first opportunity  was he thought he ought to finish the term as first  Republican governor, he ought to serve out the term, and that   s what he  did. His term ended in 1967, at the end of    66, and then in 1968, after  much soul searching, he decided to run. But he consulted with his  family, and I don   t think the family was too wild to have him run again  in 1966. There were consultations. We had a number of meetings, and he  decided to not be diverted from his governor   s responsibilities by  serving out the term.  When he ran for the US Senate, did you help with that campaign?  Yes, I had the title of Organization Director, and we just worked to get  local organizations and get enthusiasm when we traveled the state. That  was a good campaign, too. We had a very popular candidate, because  everybody liked Henry Bellmon, even the hard core Democrats  grudgingly said he was a good man. We had a young candidate versus  an old candidate. People thought he was old, Mike Monroney, who was  a nice guy. Everybody liked ol    Mike Monroney, too, but he   d been up  there about twenty-five years or so. Anyway, it was a fun campaign. I  enjoyed that one very much.  Different from the governor   s campaign in any way?  I   m sure it was different. If I think about it, it was a lot different.  Well, he was known at this point, so     He was known, yes, very well known. It was 1968, the year that Nixon  ran for president. He spent a lot of time in Washington. He was Nixon   s  national campaign chairman for a while in 1968. That was against my  advice, but I remember we were at a little coffee shop a block north of  here, and he was in town. We had a call, it was before cell phones, so  had a call on the payphone there. It was Richard Nixon wanting to talk  to Henry, trying to talk him into being the campaign chairman. He  decided to do that for a while. He got a lot of good exposure, so, despite  my advice, it was a good thing to do.  12  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  He would always go back to the farm at some point.  Yes. He always talked about that. Like George Washington and some  others always go back to the farm and retire. And he pretty well did that  on his own terms.  Did you have any meetings at the farm during this whole time?  Oh, yes, a lot of them, yes. When he ran for governor the last time, that   s  where he announced he was going to run. I can   t remember in    68 where  he announced, but   yes, I do too. He announced in four or five places in  one day. A big party flew around the state, and we flew into Lake  Texoma Lodge for one of the Senate announcements. John Tower came  up, and we did one in Oklahoma City. Lamar Alexander, who was the  governor of Tennessee at the time, he came up wearing his plaid shirt  and clodhopper boots and a real character. I don   t think he does that  anymore. (Laughter)  I think he walked the state in that     Yes, he walked the whole state. And Tennessee is a lot of state to walk.  (Laughs) So that was a lot different than the governor   s race in    86. He  had a big announcement at the farm. All the press came in and we were  going to do it outside on the patio. This horrible thunderstorm came up,  and we all had to crowd into the house and there was about forty people  there. I think the lights went out for a while. It was not a good omen to  start the campaign. (Laughter) It was a hard campaign, too. It was a  tough one. It wasn   t a shoo-in like the first Senate race.  Were you with him on election night for the Senate race, for the watch  party?  I can   t even remember. Yes, I was. Yes. Yes, we had a room at the motel  up on Lincoln, on the west side. I can   t remember the name of it now. I  rented the biggest room they had, and the whole campaign staff was  there. I remember it looked bad for Nixon. They were counting votes.  He was running against Hubert Humphrey, for president. Henry was  sitting there, wheels going around, he said   everybody was just upset, it  looked like Nixon was going to lose, and he said,    The western states  aren   t in. He   ll carry all of that.    And he did. Henry won easily, and  Nixon won fairly easily, but all the eastern part of the ones he lost were  before the western votes came in. All of the west, he carried. Everybody  was all gloom and doom until Henry said,    Don   t worry about it. Wait  until the western states come in.     Did you do anything to celebrate?  13  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Well, Henry   s celebrations were always kind of low key. (Laughs) We  went off to a big party some place downtown.  And then did you travel with him to D.C.?  Not for a long time. I was still in the state Senate until 1974, and he had  had a real hard campaign that time. There was a contested election with  Congressman Ed Edmondson. And that wasn   t settled for a long time,  the Senate had to vote for who really won. There was a ballot box, an  electronic ballot box in Tulsa, that something was wrong with it, and  they made the case that they didn   t really know who won. It took two  years to get that settled. So I did my thing here until my time was up in  the state Senate, and then he asked me to do some field work around  here. That was kind of a part-time deal. In 1980, he announced he would  not run for a second term. I figured he   d be losing staff members up  there. Everybody would be bailing out to find a job because Henry was  leaving office so I volunteered that we   d come up and help out during  the last part. And I guess he called my bluff, and we didn   t have a  graceful way to say we didn   t really mean it so Sally and I moved up  there for the last year. We got up there in January of 1980 and stayed  until February the next year.  What were some of the things you would do for him in that position?  I was considered a water expert. I did water matters, and I was still in the  guard, and I was his representative on armed services appropriations. It  was the Appropriations Sub-Committee for Armed Services, and I kept  up with issues on that and attended those meetings.  Were you surprised when he decided not to run?  Yes, I was. You thought he would have won, but I don   t know what all  the reasons were. He   d had a hard reelection campaign and things were  going on in Oklahoma, and he wanted to get back to the farm, too.  Well, if you had to look at what his service during that time was in D.C.,  what would you think his legacy might be for that time period?  Well, he was so highly regarded by both sides as an honest, dependable,  thoughtful person. He cast the deciding vote on the Panama Canal  Treaty. He came back, and he talked to groups, he talked to staff  members, and I was totally opposed to it. I had served in Panama and  had been down there a lot with the guard, in and out, and I thought I was  an expert on Panama and the canal. We built it and we had a lease on it,  so I was opposed to the treaty. But he listened. It was typical Henry  14  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Bellmon, he listened to all sides of the argument. So I went to  Washington. I was working down here at the time. I went to Washington  when the vote was coming up. Henry would always see the humor in  things so he had made up his mind what he was going to do. He called  the staff in to tell them what he was going to do. He looked up and said,     Don, I sure hate to see you here this morning.    (Laughs) I knew then he  was going to vote for the treaty.  After the meeting was over and before the Senate went into session, I  went in the office, just the two of us, to talk about it, and the telephone  rang   or the secretary came in and said,    The President is on the  phone.    President Carter. I guess he was wanting to assure that he had  the votes, and Henry did not take his call. He didn   t want anybody,  mainly himself, to think he was influenced by anything other than  making a decision on what was the wise thing to do. He didn   t want to  think the president coerced him into doing it or made a deal or  something. He didn   t talk to Carter before the vote. I don   t know if  anyone else knows that, but he had made up his mind.  Well, we talked about it years later on who was right. I thought it was  going to take forty years to figure out which one of us was right, but I  reluctantly decided he was the wise one on this thing. I know the big  influence on him, he talked to   the canal zone governor was, by law, a  lieutenant general in the Corps of Engineers. The governor, at that time,  was certainly no flaming liberal or anything, but you have to remember  this was 1978 or so, and it was right after the Vietnam War. The general  pointed out that the canal was hard to defend. And if you   ve got a  guerilla war started, there   s places you could probably throw a hand  grenade down the stack of a ship going through  the canal  if you had a  good throw. And it   s tough country. It   s all jungle around the canal. The  governor said he didn   t think, at this point, if a war like Vietnam got  started, the American public would support it. Later on, I heard some  European expert say it was a brilliant move to do that because we still  had the canal to use just like we did before, and we turned the chief  threat to the canal into the biggest defenders. So that worked out. My  advice, again, was a little bit less than perfect. (Laughter)  It helped to bounce the ideas around.  He listened to a lot of people and made up his own mind, and that was  kind of typical of Henry Bellmon. He   d gather all the facts and then  decide what was the right action on that and several other things.  Not to take the president   s call, that   s pretty bold, too, isn   t it?  Well, yes, and it was just before they were going in. He wasn   t snubbing  15  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  the president, he just didn   t want to appear to be under any influence on  the decision he made.  And deciding not to run again and moving back, there was a little bit of  time there before he ran for governor, between     Yes, 1981 is when he came home at the end of his term, January    81.  And then it was    86, was the campaign. In the meantime, he did other  things. Governor Nigh talked him in to running the Department of  Human Services on a short basis. There was a leadership vacuum there,  and he needed somebody. Again, I advised him,    You don   t want to do  that, you   ll make everybody mad.    (Laughs) He did it anyway. He was  the director of the Cowboy Hall of Fame for a while after they fell into  financial difficulties, and they asked him to serve and get that  straightened out and back on sound footing. So he did that.  How did he come to decide to run for governor the second time?  Well, we talked about it, and it was not an easy decision on his part. In  fact, it depended on a lot of other things, his financial and farm  operations, to all come together. We had a campaign headquarters in the  west side of Oklahoma City, over near Penn Square. We were working.  We were going after it, and there was a draft committee and all this  stuff. We were getting ready to send out our first statewide  announcement to all the supporters and had a big list. At the last minute,  he decided he couldn   t commit right then. We had thousands of letters  ready to go in the mail. Well, we stopped that, and the announcement  party was cancelled. We had to take all those letters apart and change the  date.  A week later, he decided there was a go. Part of it was some of his  personal financial things he had to get straightened out before he jumped  into a race like that, which would take him away from the farm and  everything else he was doing. So that happened. That was kind of a  dramatic thing, stopping, taking all those letters apart, had volunteers un-stuffing  them and reprinting new stuff and then re-stuffing the letters.  That was an interesting start to the campaign.  Here   s an interesting picture. (Gesturing to photograph on wall) In 1961,  Kennedy came back to Oklahoma when he was president to dedicate a  two-lane road, down in a place called Big Cedar, Oklahoma, which is  not even a crossroads. It   s not a town or anything. And they built this  two-lane asphalt road, they paved it. And Kennedy came down to cut the  ribbon and somebody asked him,    Why did you?    At that time, Lyndon  Johnson had been elected vice-president and Bob Kerr was our senior  senator. They call him the un-crowned king of the Senate. He was the  16  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  most powerful Oklahoman we ever sent up there. They asked Kennedy,  somebody asked him later,    Why did you go down there?    He said,    I  came down to kiss Bob Kerr   s ass.    But this picture, this is Ed  Edmondson, he was in Congress for eighteen years and was Henry   s  opponent in  the  1974 Senate  race . Mike Monroney was in the Senate  for about eighteen years, and he   s the one Henry ran against in 1968.  Carl Albert, he was the later Speaker of the House. He was probably the  highest ranking Oklahoman ever up there. There   s President Kennedy.  Here   s Ed   s brother, Howard Edmondson, who was a governor in the     60s, and Senator Bob Kerr, who was king of the Senate at the time.  That was quite a historic picture. And then here, that   s me. (Laughter)  That   s very nice.  It was a historic time to get that much power  in one place .  And it was taken where?  Big Cedar, Oklahoma, which is not a town. It   s just a place. (Laughs)  We were talking about his decision to come back and run for governor  the second time.  Well, a lot of people wanted him to do that, and I   m sure he wanted to in  the end, after he got it all sorted out. That was not a real easy campaign.  It was the reverse of the    68 Senate campaign where we had a young  challenger. Here we had David Walters  who  was the young dapper  candidate, and Henry was the friendly, older, senior statesman. And it  was a tough campaign. I found some pictures the other day   cut to the  end, after the chase. On the night we were over at the Marriot Hotel, that  was going to be our big victory party. It got to be about ten-thirty at  night. We were in a big room upstairs with the Bellmons and some of  the supporters and campaign staffers. And it got to be about ten-thirty,  and there   d been no decision. There was nothing decisive on the vote.  That campaign was complicated, because there were a couple of  independents in the race, and they siphoned off some votes, too, I   m  sure. Obviously, it did.  So about ten-thirty, he made the decision that we   d go down to the party,  the big crowd there, and tell them that,    Maybe you better go home and  go to bed, and we   ll get this sorted out tomorrow or later.    That was the  decision because we just didn   t know and it was getting late. So we all  got out into the hall and about that time, somebody came running out of  the room and said,    David Walters is on the phone.    He called up to  concede and that just changed the gloom and doom. (Laughs) Everybody  was kind of down, that changed it to kind of euphoric. So I headed on  17  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  down to the ballroom, where the victory party was. I found this picture  somebody took from the sidelines, and I was up explaining what was  about to happen. And then here came Henry and Shirley. We introduced  them as the next Governor of Oklahoma and First Lady. The crowd went  wild. But it was a tough race. It was not a shoo-in kind of a deal at all.  Did she do her Bellmon Belles for that campaign, too?  Oh, yes. Yes. A lot of three-time Belles or four-time Belles were there.  (Laughter) Yes, it was a hard race. We had a campaign gathering out at  the Oklahoma City Zoo on about the Friday evening before the election  on Tuesday. At that time, we were doing some polling, and it showed we  were losing the race. The other side had done a lot of negative  advertising, and it was taking its toll. We left the party with big smiles  on our face, and we went to Channel 9, cutting commercials, trying to  get in that weekend because it looked like a desperation deal. I had some  personal things going here. We   d had a newspaper fire, an arson fire,  and so I drug home that Friday night or Saturday morning, real, real late  and got back over to Chandler.  The next morning I got up, and I found out from some telephone calls  that the people that were suspected of the arson had been arrested. They  weren   t arrested for the arson, they were arrested for a civil rights  violation over here. Long story, but anyway, I got dressed and I hurried  and went to Oklahoma City to the FBI office, and they announced all  this stuff. And downtown, they arraigned all these people. I went to the  campaign headquarters and I was so euphoric, I could hardly breathe,  hyperventilating. Here was this gloom and doom with the people who  were out there working Saturday morning at the office. But it did look  pretty bad, and it was a close race. But it all worked out. I think the state  of Oklahoma is much better off for it working the way it did.  What kind of commercials did you make to counteract that?  Oh, I don   t remember the details. Just trying to explain some things and  raising some questions about the other candidate.  Campaign financing, I guess, changed quite a bit, too, from the first race  to the last, right?  Oh, yes. The numbers sure raised. They just keep going up  astronomically, like the national debt. I think we raised over a million  dollars at the last governor   s race and thought that was just awful. Well,  that   s not even a start anymore on a congressional race or a Senate race  or a governor   s race. Of course, the dollar keeps getting cheaper so  maybe it doesn   t cost anymore, really.  18  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Do you have any memories of swearing-in day?  I do. This last one, it was a warm day in January, a lovely day. I  remember I sat right in front of Ann Bartlett, whose husband, Dewey,  was the second Republican governor and followed Henry. And he was  also elected to the US Senate later. I remember talking with Ann a lot  and that was on Tuesday. Then on Thursday we had this horrible snow  storm. I was brand new in my office as general in charge of using the  Guard to help with natural disasters. I was broken in in a hurry, because  the state was just shut down with that big storm. It came just a few days  after it was eighty degrees, just like it did here a month or so ago. I  remember that part of it, and then I was sworn in, I guess, later in the  week.  Did a lot of people attend?  Oh, yes. It was a big crowd. The whole capitol south plaza there was full  because it was such nice weather. I think this last one was kind of cold.  Did he have any big issues the second term in office?  Yes, the state was about broke when he came in. That was after the oil  bust and all that. The big issue is that House Bill 1017, the school reform  thing. That was a tough one because it meant raising taxes, and he was  philosophically opposed to raising taxes, but he thought this was an  important thing to do. He never backed off from unpopular issues if he  thought it was right. The school bussing thing was a big deal, the  Panama Canal and this, twenty years ago, the school reform thing, for  which he was honored just before he died. He tackled the hard things,  and he didn   t have any Republican support in the legislature at that time.  It was the Democrats that helped him get that passed.  How early would he get to the capitol, do you have any idea?  Well, that was a legend that he   d show up about six o   clock. When he  first took office in 1963, the governor   s place was locked up. He  couldn   t get in because nobody came to work that early. (Laughs) Yes,  that got to be a legend. And then in the  US  Senate, when I worked up  there, I went up in January, short days and stormy weather in  Washington, he wanted to be there at seven o   clock in the morning.  Some of us are carpooling in, so we   d get down there in the dark, it   s  still dark, and park underground and go to the office. And then he  wanted to keep the office open during business hours in Oklahoma,  which meant we wouldn   t get away from there until seven o   clock at  night, seven-thirty. So it seemed like that first month up there, I never  19  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  did see the daylight except on weekends, because we were parking  underground, driving in the dark both ways. (Laughs)  He was a hard worker. Hours didn   t bother him. And then he   d come  back here when he was in the Senate, and I was doing some work here  for him. We   d drive 600 miles on a weekend going to these gatherings  and meetings and making speeches, and he wasn   t even a candidate.  That   s the way he worked. I probably saw more Washington area in the  year we were up there than he did in twelve years because he was  always back here on the weekend when he wasn   t working up there.  Did he drive himself or did he have a driver?  Darn sure he had a driver. I flew him some, too. I had an airplane then,  and so we   d kind of enlarge the scope of his travels on the weekends  back here. No, he didn   t spend many weekends in Washington.  Did Shirley come, too?  Sometimes, but she spent a lot of time up there. And the year we were  there, we ran around some with Shirley because he was gone. So I think  she was glad to come back home.  Did they have any dinners, when they were there, for the whole staff?  Yes, we   d go out to the house. Shirley was quite a cook so we   d have  these parties, staff parties. We lived in a condo in Alexandria, and we  had a big party room on the top floor, and we   d have some up there.  From what I understand, the staff was pretty close?  Yes, yes. Still are. We get together occasionally. Of course, they   re  spread all over the country and     That   s a little bit unusual from what I hear.  Well, I don   t know. Most of them are from Oklahoma, but some weren   t  and still stay in the loop.  Because of the length of time he was in public service, I guess, the same  people almost served the entire length?  Some did. Bob Haught was in it from the beginning to the end. Well, he  didn   t do anything in the  second  governor   s term, but I was in the first  term and worked in the Senate and then worked in the last governor   s  term.  20  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  His second term as governor, could he have run another term?  Yes, he could   well, I don   t know. You   d have to research the law. I  think he could have.  But he didn   t even think about     Well, I   m sure he thought about it, but he decided not to  run again .  He was ready to go back to the farm.  He was ready to go back to the farm. Yes. He decided not to. It was kind  of a relief to me. I didn   t think I was up to another campaign.  Well, three is quite a bit. He never lost one, once he started in public  campaigning     Well, he did. When he came out of the Marine Corps after World War II,  I think 1946, he ran for the state House seat up there, the House of  Representatives. He served one term, and in his words, he thought he   d  done such a good job his first term that he would just be re-elected. He  said he made a mistake, he didn   t campaign very hard, and he got beat.  Yes, he explained that several times. (Laughs) He wasn   t going to make  that mistake again. The only time he ran for re-election after that was the  Senate race in 1974, and that was a tough race. Of course, he had a lot of  baggage with him, that school bussing issue was one that was really  tough here and controversial. But he did what he thought was right, and  he knew it was not politically popular. He knew that ahead of time.  Did he have a couple of common phrases or sayings?  I can   t recall any right now. You leave, and I   ll come up with several.  (Laughter)  Are there one or two things that you know that no one else might know?  Well, a couple of things. One thing, he was a very modest man, lived  within his means. There was a scandal started when we were in the  Senate that a lot of these senators had sweetheart car leasing deals from  one of the manufacturers. I won   t say which one, but they were driving  big fancy Lincoln Town Cars, and  1000 a year lease or something like  that. The New York Times started this survey, and so they called me and  wanted to talk about the governor   s car. And I said,    I want you to come  out.    Well, when we got up there, he was driving a Ford Grenada Coupe,  which was a cheap car. This was the cheapest Ford ever built, I   m sure.  21  Finchum  Ferrell  It was no power steering, no power brakes, no air conditioning. I said,     You   re living in Washington and no air conditioning?    He said,    Well,  it only takes forty-five minutes to get home.    This was a stick shift and  everything, and it was just the most stripped down car I ever saw.  He was looking at the paper one Saturday morning, and they advertised  at a place out in Virginia, this Ford company, for just some ridiculous  price, about  2,000. And he said he went out to look at it. Well, it was  one of these bait and switch deals. They didn   t want to sell that car  because it was so cheap and no options or anything on it. He thought it  was just great. He said he liked to never got them to sell him that thing.  (Laughs) But he bought it, and he was driving that, and he was kind of  hard on cars anyway. He was used to driving tractors and trucks out in a  pasture. Staff would just hate to have to take him to the airport and drive  his car out there. I tried to talk to the reporter to come out and look at  that car. I wanted him to see it. But that was not sensational, so the New  York Times opted not to see what Senator Bellmon was driving.  (Laughter)  How long did he keep that one?  Well, it was pretty well worn out when he got rid of it. He didn   t swap  cars much. He was a modest man, and there   s one story I   d like to tell  you. When I first went to work on the governor   s staff   most governors,  when they travel anywhere, Washington or around Oklahoma City or  wherever, they take a lot of security with them, and Henry didn   t like  that idea at all. Well, he was invited up to Washington. Lyndon Johnson  was going to explain why the Vietnam War was about over. This was in  the fall of 1965. At the last minute, he decided he ought to have  somebody go with him to keep track of his luggage or something, and so  they pointed to me. I had just been on the staff a short time.   At the last minute, the only airline reservation left was in first class.  So  we took off and Henry was sitting back in the back with the crying  babies and everybody, and I was sitting in first class. (Laughs) He  wasn   t about to ride first class and let anybody say that he   d done that.  We went to Washington, got up there. We stayed at the old Willard  Hotel, which is right around the corner from the White House, because it  was cheap then. Now, it   s about four hundred dollars a night, but this  was in the old days. The next morning, we went over to the White  House. We went over  with  the governor of Washington, and he had a  big highway patrolman going with him, and some of them had two or  three guys. Well, we got over there, and I was his only protection.  (Laughs)  Anyway, they spent the day at the White House. And the conference was  22  so top-level that  there were  no staffers   just the governors and Lyndon  Johnson. They went into session there and  I spent the day with  Jimmy  Jones  who  was later congressman from the Tulsa area and the  ambassador to Mexico. He was the appointment secretary. I knew him  when he was a journalism student down at OU. And all of a sudden they  announced late in the afternoon that there was going to be a press  conference, and it was at the Blue Room at the White House. You   d go  in the north door there, and it was a crazy scene. We walked in there and  here was Lyndon Johnson grabbing these reporters by the arm and  telling them,    Get o in  here  These governors got to get home     He was  dragging them in there, and I walked inside, and there was the whole  leadership of the United States government. Here were most of the  governors, nearly all the governors, Hubert Humphrey, the vice-president,  the secretary of state, and defense, and they were all there. It  was quite a picture. They were all there, except I couldn   t find Henry  Bellmon. I thought,    My, God, I   m a brand new staffer, and I   ve lost the  governor      I asked one of the White House staff there, I said,    Where is  Governor   Bellmon?    They said,    Well, he said it was time to go. He left.    I said,     He left?    (Laughs) I was really getting panicky. I said,    Hey, our  airplane is scheduled to leave here in something like thirty minutes.    I  said,    Is there any way you can get me a car and get me to the airport?     And pretty soon up the north portico, here comes this big black car, and  it screeches to a stop and I got in. We went around the corner to the  Willard, and our bags had been checked that morning so we picked those  up, and we headed out to Dulles Airport, which is a long drive. It was on  a Saturday afternoon and there wasn   t much traffic, but it was still a long  drive. I was looking at my watch and it was getting late and I said,    Is  there any way you can talk to your dispatchers and have them call  American Airlines and kind of explain what is going on?     He got on the radio and he said,    Okay, we   ll hold it fifteen minutes.     Well, it was twenty-five or thirty minutes before we got there. We pulled  up in front of the Dulles thing and here   s two or three blue suits out there  and I don   t know, communication difficulties, and they tore the door  open and got my bags and said,    Governor Ferrell?     And I said,    Uh  oh.    (Laughs) Bad deal. Anyway, I   m sure if I told them it was a mistake  I   d get arrested or something. So, anyway, we swooped up there into the  American Airlines desk, and they slapped his hands on the desk and  said,    Governor Ferrell   s got to get to that airplane out there      They had those big transports, the big bus-like things that take you to the  airplane at Dulles. These people had been sitting there for thirty minutes,  and they stayed right on my elbow carrying my bags, and we went into  the bus there. And here   s Henry Bellmon, sitting over there, reading a  23  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Reader   s Digest. He had decided it was time to leave, and so he caught a  bus out to Dulles and got on there, ready to go. I said,    There   s been a  terrible mistake made, Governor. I   m sorry about all this.    I told him  about what it was, and he just grinned real big, and he didn   t tell  anybody any different. They just kept going and, anyway, he managed to  get himself out there, sitting there on the bus with everybody else and no  complaints about protocol and privilege and all that. That was Henry  Bellmon.  Just a people   s person.  He was, absolutely. A lot of politicians like to think that of themselves,  but he was the genuine article.  That   s a very good story.  Anyway, I was the security on that trip, and I couldn   t even keep up with  him. (Laughter)  Anything else?  Well, 1966 was the governor   s race. Henry was going out of office.  There was a Stillwater man,  Preston Moore , who had been the  American Legion  national commander , and he was  the  Democrat  candidate after another bruising Democrat primary. Dewey Bartlett, a  state senator from Tulsa, was the Republican candidate. And it looked  like the Democrat was winning. At that time, the state treasurer   s office  used to run around and do favors to bankers. He would give state  deposits, which was sort of free money back then so the favored bankers  got that. I think seventeen people filed for governor that year on the  Democrat ticket. It was a nasty battle. The attorney general was Charles  Nesbitt, and he had lost  his bid for governor . He was still the attorney  general so he heard this story that they were going to send Cowboy Pink  Williams, who was by that time the state treasurer, and he was going to  go around and raise enough money, because Preston Moore was a  Democrat. His campaign had run out of money so the Democrat powers  worked out the deal that Cowboy Pink, who was a great old man, but he  was a solid core Democrat, was going to go around and peddle some of  the state money in return for campaign contributions.  Charlie Nesbitt, Democrat, he heard about this. So he got with Henry  Bellmon, and there was a little known state agency called the State  Depository Board. And by statute and the constitution, it was supposed  to regulate who got the state fund deposits. It had never been used, the   state  treasurer had run it. But the governor, the state treasurer, and the  attorney general were the three members of the State Depository Board.  24  Well, Charlie decided they ought to meet. He was no friend of Preston  Moore   s either, because he   d just got beat in a campaign primary. So, at  about five o   clock one evening, I was press secretary then, Henry  stepped down the hall and said,    Come in, we   re going to have a  meeting.    I didn   t know what was going on. It had just come up.  The deal was that the State Depository Board would raise the interest  rate on state funds that the banks had to pay. Poor Pink Williams, he was  kind of caught in the middle. He was kind of sandbagged there, at the  first ever meeting of that  board . Henry always wanted one of his  people to witness what was going on, and I was the only one still left  there. They told Pink what was going to happen, that they were going to  raise the rates, and then they told Pink he had to announce it. I went back  to the office and typed out a press release, and then I took Pink up to the  capitol press room on the fourth floor, and he had to announce it. Well,  that shut off any flow from friendly banks, because he was telling them   the rates were going up for state deposits . They had to pay if they  wanted that money. There weren   t going to be any contributions with  that when they found out they were going to have to pay a lot more. That  might have been, certainly was, a factor in Dewey Bartlett winning,  because they didn   t have that last minute inflow of money in the  governor   s race by his opponent. That was an interesting event, and I   ve  never seen that written about anywhere.  Then another money deal, when he didn   t run for reelection in 1980.  Before he left, he was the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget  Committee and would have been the chairman because the Republicans  took over  the Senate  in 1980. He called a meeting in the office on one  of his last days there. He called in Howard Baker, who was going to be  the Senate majority leader, and he called in the senator  Pete Dominici   from New Mexico who was going to be the chairman, and he called  several others  including  Bob Dole. He had this early morning meeting  with donuts and coffee. He had Bob Haught and me and Bob Fulton,  who did budget matters for Henry. His message to them was don   t get  all excited about cutting taxes, because everybody will be for that, but  then you   re going to have to do these reforms to make up for that, and  nobody is going to be for cutting the budget. They   ve got to go together,  cut taxes and cut the budget at the same time. I think we had a three  hundred billion dollar deficit then. The last year of the Carter   administration , that was considered terrible. That was his story, and he  wanted his people there, but apparently they didn   t listen to him, because  they cut taxes, but they didn   t cut spending.  You asked me about Henry, a couple of things, about his activities. He  liked to fish and hunt. After the 1974 election, they had this long session  to determine who was going to be declared the winner. The Senate has  25  Finchum  Ferrell  the right to decide their own membership and settle these disputes.  Congressman Edmondson was the other party. He   d been the Democrat  candidate. There was a disputed box in Tulsa and, anyway, there was  controversy. And the Senate had to decide that. It was a long drawn out  ordeal.  After Henry was declared the winner, he wanted to have a quail dinner  for some of his core supporters in the Senate. We were hunting quail  down in Oklahoma, trying to get enough quail together for a wild quail  dinner. We were hunting Lincoln County, down south of Chandler, on  the Deep Fork River bottoms and got into a lot of quail. It was getting  dark. We were out there, we were still shooting. It was just almost so  dark you couldn   t see. And when you   d shoot your gun, you   d get this  big flare of fire there, and it   d about blind you. We hunted until it got  just almost too dark to find our car to go back home. But he went back  with a lot of quail and had a big victory dinner.  Then one other story about good ole modest Henry Bellmon, after he  was out of the Senate, a mutual friend, a newspaper editor in Perry, died.  I drove up to go to the funeral, and Shirley had dropped Henry off at the  funeral home about the time I got there. We walked in and sat together.  He said,    Can you give me a lift when this service is over?       Well, sure,  yes.    So when it was over, I said,    Where do you want to go?    He said,     Take me up to the John Deere store.    He had had a big tractor hauled in  there to be worked on, and it was a couple hundred bucks to load it up  on a truck and take it back to the farm. He decided he could drive those  sixteen miles in that tractor. And this was a big tractor with dual back  wheels, and it about filled the road up. So here we showed up at the John  Deere dealership and a couple guys were standing around there. Henry  announced he was going to drive his tractor home. Well, he was in his  best suit, funeral suit. And they got all upset, and they got out there, and  they kind of dust the tractor out a little bit because they hadn   t cleaned it  up, they just worked on it. The last picture I saw of Henry that day, he  waved and he headed up a two lane highway north out of Perry, driving  that huge tractor so he wouldn   t have to pay to have it trucked home.  (Laughs) He was one of a kind, I believe.  You mentioned earlier about he didn   t like to campaign on Sundays?  He never campaigned on Sunday, no. He   d make a point that   he went  to church. If he was at the farm, he   d drive to Perry to the First  Presbyterian Church. That   s where they held his funeral, the second  service. No, he didn   t make any big deal about it. He just said,    No, we  don   t do that. We   re not going to campaign on Sunday. We don   t go to  any events.     26  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Did he attend service in D.C., do you know?  Yes. Of course, he didn   t spend many weekends up there, but yes. I  don   t recall going to church with him in Washington, but one time we  went out to Colorado. They were going to ride with us. We drove up  there and met him at church. Kind of a funny thing. They had a new  preacher. Henry kind of had some old line ways that he knew what  church service ought to be. The new preacher up there said,    Good  morning     Everybody hollered    Good morning.    On the way to the  house after that, he said,    What do you think of our new preacher?    I  didn   t know what to think of his new preacher, I didn   t want to say  anything. He said,    We   ve kind of turned into a holy roller church up  here with all this,    Hello, good morning business.       (Laughter) Anyway,  he had a good sense of humor.  Once he finished with the second governorship, you stayed in touch?  Oh, yes. We   d meet up in Stillwater or Oklahoma City. He liked to come  down for lunch. He got to where he couldn   t drive, hardly, or not like he  could before. And so one of the daughters would bring him down, and  then he married again, married Eloise. She kind of gave him a new lease  on life. He had early Parkinson   s. He started to suffer from that while he  was still governor. He did it about as gracefully as you could. He quit  hunting. He said he just couldn   t swing the shotgun and walk like he  could before. But he didn   t complain. I never heard him complain about  anything.  Was his favorite food quail?  No, his favorite food, when you   d go out to eat, he liked to go to  Mexican places. He had them all picked out, Oklahoma City and Tulsa  and Pauls Valley, he knew where he wanted to go.  He had his favorite spots, huh?  Yes, and it was always Mexican.  When you would fly him from place to place, do you have any stories  about that?  Yes, a couple. He had this well-known thing of going to sleep at places.  He could sleep through   soon as you   d get in the car, he   d go to sleep. I  remember we flew into Muskogee one day and landed at Hat Box Field,   where they have  short runways. It was a windy day, rough and  everything. We flew in there and had a bumpy   the airplane was  shaking all over and landed and taxied up to the parking place, and he  27  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  woke up when I shut the engine down. I thought,    How can you sleep  through that?    (Laughter)  He must have late hours, might go to bed late to be able to sleep     No, he went to bed early. He was not a night owl at all. But he got up  early.  Just felt safe in your hands, I guess.  I don   t know if you   ve talked to Burns Hargis or not, but he   s got this  story he tells that they got started when he was governor the first time.  They got the rumor started that he liked buttermilk, and they called him  Buttermilk Bellmon, some did. The truth was he didn   t like buttermilk at  all, and Burns tells this story that   my wife likes buttermilk   and Burns  tells this story that at these dinners and luncheons and all, they   d  ceremonially bring him a big glass of buttermilk, and he   d say,    Pass  that down to Sally.    (Laughs) Were you going to talk to Burns?  I probably should.  Oh, yes. Burns has got a lot of experiences with the governor.  Well, Burns interviewed Bellmon for us a couple years ago.  Oh, he did?  So if he went to bed early, got up early, then he didn   t do cat naps  during the day unless he was in a car?  Oh, he did a lot of catnaps during the day. It   s a funny thing, sometimes  he   d have a hard time staying awake at these committee hearings and  meetings and all. But then you   d think he was asleep, and he   d wake up,  and he   d ask some penetrating question that kind of indicated he had a  real knowledge of what the guy was talking about and what he   d said.  He   d fool you on that. I think he   d lay a trap for people. (Laughs)  He just had his eyes closed.  Yes. The staff members would bring him mints and things, trying to  keep him awake. He stayed with us  after that quail hunt . We went to  our Presbyterian church the next morning. The congregation was kind of  delighted and impressed to see the former governor and U.S. senator  there. And I have a tendency to drop off to sleep during sermons, and we  both just  fought to stay awake . We   d walked fifteen miles the night  before, hunting. Nobody was impressed that neither one of us could stay  28  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  awake during a sermon. (Laughter)  Quail, I   ve not had quail before.  Oh, you haven   t  Oh, that   s great stuff. You don   t see any wild quail.  They all disappeared around here.  Any stories about his interactions with his senator friends and for  opposing   well, maybe they   re not friends, but     Well, he had a lot of friends up there. He was highly regarded as an  honest, dependable, logical, ethical person. In fact, that last year up  there, they passed a resolution that he was the most trusted senator,  somebody did. The most trusted senator out of the 100 of them was  Henry Bellmon. That   d be an interesting thing to look up. That happened  in 1980. He was well thought of, and he seemed to know all of them.  I   ve never run into an old senator that didn   t know who Henry Bellmon  was.  Did a lot of hand shaking, I guess.  Yes, and he was just good to work with. He made decisions based on  what was right, and he was not overly partisan.  When he finished the governorship he went back to the farm, and what  did you do?  I had sold the newspaper during that period and came home, got  immersed in things around here.  And you would see him once or twice a year or more?  Oh, more. Sometimes we would have several staff get-togethers. He   d  come down and meet us for lunch at some Mexican place. No, we   d get  together, tried to, about once a month. Somebody would drive him down  from the farm. We   d meet at Stillwater sometimes. Yes, he tried to keep  in touch.  Did a lot of reading?  I guess he did. He was pretty well read. He kept up with what was going  on in the world and the state. I   d call and we   d talk on the phone. He   d  either call you at six o   clock in the morning or you   d have to call him  before about eight o   clock at night. He finally got a cell phone. He didn   t  like telephones at all, or the cell phone. He finally   somebody, either  Eloise or the kids, made him get one. (Laughter)  29  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Did he stay much in politics after he left?  He followed it. I don   t think he got involved in any politics. Maybe  some local office up there, but anybody who was going to run for  governor came to see Henry Bellmon. We were at a bridge dedication  down in Southeast Oklahoma one time, during the first term   well, I  think it was during when he was governor the first time. We sat down at  this dedication program  while  some old senator from down there made  his long speech. And, like I said, that was before cell phones, and  somebody came to me and said the office had called and said  the  governor  had a call from a certain person and wanted to talk to Henry.  When the thing was over, I told him he had this telephone call from this  guy and he said,    Well, I know what he wants to talk about.    He said,     You   re having breakfast some morning and talking about what was  going on and your wife said,    Well, you   d make as good a governor as  that guy.    So all the sudden you think everybody in the world wants you  to run for governor.    (Laughter) He had a view on things that was kind  of funny.  Shirley must have, too, if she helped you campaign.  Yes. They had coffees out at the farm for me and things around Noble  County, Perry, and Billings. I ran real strong up there. I ran stronger up  there than I did in my home county. (Laughter)  In part because of your relationship with them?  I   m sure it was. I   m sure it was. I used to have a framed picture of one of  the campaign brochures, and I   ve kind of used it to kind of play on our  relationship. I made that trip to Iwo Jima that time and somebody took a  picture of Henry and I kneeling on the beach with all this leftover World  War II artillery brass and stuff. And in the background you can see  Mount Suribachi, and I used that picture in a campaign brochure. That   s  a pretty cheesy thing to do, I guess, but it didn   t hurt. (Laughs)  He had a good reputation.  Oh, he did. He was so highly regarded. I think that   s the story of Henry  Bellmon, that people had a great confidence in him, that he was an  honest person, and to get elected governor twice over a period of twenty-five  years and elected twice to the United States Senate. And both times  it was a history making thing. The first time a Republican governor and I  think the second time we had a Republican senator for Oklahoma. And  then the first time a Republican ever got elected a second time. Dewey  Bartlett, he missed out, but Frank Keating got elected  governor  twice  30  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum   as a  Republican, but somebody had to break the ice the first time.  He paved the path.  Yes. Someone used to introduce him as the first and last Republican  governor, but it didn   t worked out that way.  And I understand he liked to be referred to as just a farmer?  Yes, but you mentioned something about the Republican Party and his  term as state party chairman. He kind of invented the new Republican  Party in Oklahoma. The joke was they could have a state convention in a  telephone booth, and that wasn   t too far wrong. It was just kind of some  old settled Republicans that were the party in Oklahoma. He made it a  broad welcome party. And if it wasn   t for Henry Bellmon, I don   t think  we   d   it wouldn   t have been as fast, anyway, as it was because he  certainly made the Republican Party in Oklahoma, made it respectable,  made people take it seriously. I know when I turned twenty-one, and I  lived in Oklahoma County, there wasn   t a Republican anything. When I  went down to register, they didn   t even ask me how I wanted to register.  They just registered me as a Democrat. If they had asked me I probably  would have said,    Yes, I guess so,    because my parents were Democrats.  The whole family had been Democrats.  I found out later there were some closet Republicans in my family that I  didn   t know about, because they didn   t talk about it. If you wanted to  vote in an election in Oklahoma County, it was settled in the Democrat  primary because the Republicans didn   t get elected to anything. Now, I  think everything in Oklahoma County is Republican, just about. The  county commissioners and the assessor and the treasurer, so it   s been a  real change. Whoever thought the Democrats would be the minority and  a small minority. When I was Republican leader in the state Senate my  last two years, we had nine Republicans and thirty-nine Democrats, so I  kind of laugh when they complain about the majority rolling over them  now in the Senate and in the House. They   ve got more members in the  Senate than we did when I was a Republican down there.  Do you know how he came to be a Republican? Do you know the story  behind that?  Well, I think that was just family. Noble County was kind of up in there  in the Republican area with Garfield and Grant and all these Republican  names up there. He kind of inherited it and believed in it.  And we   re still talking about it.  31  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Finchum  Ferrell  Yes. The reason he got into politics, he went through this bloody Pacific  War, and his story was he decided there ought to be a better way to settle  things than to go to war and kill millions and disrupt the world and  bankrupt the world. He thought there was a better way to do it. That   s  the reason he got in it and stayed in it.  Who was his first campaign manager?  Oh, let   s see.  They had to have a good strategy to win the first     Yes, and they had a lot of luck, too, like I mentioned earlier, just lucky  breaks. The Democrats just fought each other. The Democrat Party was  really split up when that was over, and there were a lot of them that were  so mad.  Well, then he kind of patched that up by bringing them over and  Democrats     Yes, well, they stayed home or they   Raymond Gary, from Madill,  Oklahoma, he served as governor, and he was sort of involved in that  primary that was so nasty. There was an urban/rural split there, too.  Atkinson was a Midwest City, Oklahoma City developer, and all the  Democrats had all been mainly from rural areas. There was one occasion  that Raymond Gary   s mother died and had the funeral, and Henry just  happened to be campaigning down in that area. He broke off from the  planned events and drove to Madill and went to the funeral. And  Raymond Gary, who was kind of a sentimental old guy, like we all get  to be, that meant so much to him. And he embraced him out on the  church steps there in Madill, and people notice those things. It was a  sincere thing on Henry   s part. But it was events you can   t forecast that  just happen, and he had a lot of lucky events that happened in his  political career.  He just added the human touch, too.  Yes, he did that.  Is that a good way to end or do you have anything else?  Well, we could probably talk all day when you think of something else.  (Laughs) Anyway, I had a good time. It was a big part of my life and  guided me in ways over about fifty years. It was 1960,    61 when we first  got involved and got to know Henry Bellmon. And I don   t know  anybody in public life that I   ve got more regard for, for being a modest,  32  Finchum  Ferrell  honest, nice person to know and to represent you in high office. We need  more Henry Bellmons.  That   s a good way to close. I agree. Well, thank you for your time today.  It   s been great.  Well, I   m glad you came down.  -------  -------
