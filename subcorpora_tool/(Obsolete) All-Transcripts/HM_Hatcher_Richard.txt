Speaker 1: Mr. Hatcher, I'd like to take you back to your childhood.  But I want to ask about your parents first.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: First I'd like to ask about your father, Carlton Hatcher.  If you could tell us about what you know about his background and his growing up.
Speaker 2: My father grew up in Macon, Georgia, as a matter of fact, a small town outside of Macon, Georgia called Lizella.  And he was an individual who worked almost from the time that he was born.  But he, when he was about 12, 13 years old, he dropped out of school and went to work full-time in a sawmill.  He was a very industrious and a very--although he lacked education, he was a person with a presence.  And as a result of his hard work, and I suppose other characteristics or qualities that the owner of the sawmill saw in him, he made him a foreman.  The problem of course was that he was black, and he was a foreman, and he was making less than the whites who were working under him who he was in effect supervising.  And this went on until he was approximately 20, 21 years old.  He had married, and two of my sisters had been born.  We have a very large family.  There were thirteen children in all, and seven of them survived.  But at any rate, my father wanted better things.  He wanted for one thing to make more money.  He was being paid maybe fifty cents a day.  So, he decided-- another sawmill owner offered him a job, and he was going to quit and go to work for the other sawmill.  When his boss, the owner of the sawmill that he worked for found out about that, he did something--or attempted to do something that was pretty typical in those days.  If a Negro did not do what the boss wanted them to do, he would simply call the county sheriff and have the sheriff pick him up and put him in jail until he decided to do whatever it was he wanted him to do.  So, his boss, who he called Mr. Charlie, interestingly, called the sheriff.  And the sheriff came out to this little community called Lizella, where my father and mother [Catherine Hatcher] were living at the time, looking for my father.  Fortunately, my father, who walked home every day from Macon... there was a friend sitting on the porch.  And she called him and told him that the sheriff was looking for him.  And so, he realized what was going to happen--he was going to go to jail.  So, he decided at that point that it was time for him to leave the South.  And they, what they would normally do, they wouldn't let you leave.  So, he and some friends, they got him dressed up as a woman and put him on a train.  And the train was stopped at the next town from Macon.  It was stopped, and this sheriff came on board because he had heard that he was on board, but he didn't recognize him.  And so, he was able to keep going to where he got off the train.  And then he took a bus, because he couldn't afford to take a train all the way north.  His goal was, the place that he wanted to go was Chicago [Illinois].  He had heard all these wonderful stories.  He had two sisters who had moved to Chicago a few years before then.  And they would write back and say--they didn't quite say the streets were paved with gold, but said anyone could get a job.  You know, if you could come up, you'd get a job and they paid a decent wage.  And so, his goal was Chicago.  His problem was that he didn't have enough money to--he only had enough money to buy a ticket as far as Michigan City, Indiana.  And so, his thought was that he would get off the bus in Michigan City and walk around and try to find someone that would let him cut their grass or do something to earn a few dollars so that he could make it on to Chicago.  And that was the beginning of a forty-five year stay in Michigan City, when he only planned to stay for a few days.
Story_ID: 78184
Speaker 1: And at any rate, he [Hatcher's father, Carlton Hatcher] got a job in a factory in Michigan City [Indiana], and was able to earn enough money to bring my mother [Catherine Hatcher] and my two sisters up to Michigan City.  And so that's where the family then began to grow, and that's where we lived.  Now, we lived in the very worse section of Michigan, an area called "The Patch."  It was... they use nice words like "ghetto" these days.  But at that time it was just the Patch, and that was where all the black people in Michigan City had to live.  They had no choice, they couldn't live anywhere else... and we lived in the Patch.  The streets were not paved.  Some of the houses opened onto alleys.  We, I recall as a boy growing up, there was a railroad track right across the street from our house, and sometimes they would leave coal cars sitting on the rails overnight.  That was a mistake, because we would liberate the coal, because we couldn't buy it.  (Laughter).  We would go and get bags of coal and bring it home so that, you know, you could have a fire.  That, my father... the thing about my father, even though he never had an education, he was a very good mathematician, he could count.  He could count very well.  And so, this really helped him to begin to do two things--one, to save.  He didn't make a lot of money, but he saved money.  And he was enough of a, he had enough of the entrepreneurial spirit to buy a couple of houses.  And so, he would collect the rent; he did everything.  He'd make the repairs; he did everything while he was still working.  The job he had at Pullman-Standard [Pullman Palace Car Company] was a very hot, a very hard job.  And the problem with it was that every year there would be so many months that the shop would close down, and so you'd just be laid off.  You wouldn't have any money.  And during those periods I can remember growing up, my father would get a pushcart, and he would let me go with him sometimes.  And we'd go down to the downtown area, go through the alleys and collect cardboard boxes.  And if you got enough of them and you pressed them down and packed them down, then you could take them over to a junkyard and sell them.  And that's how he would support his family during the periods when the Pullman was closed down.
Story_ID: 78185
Speaker 1: My father [Carlton Hatcher], even though he only went to the second grade... he went to the second grade... but he always had this dream for his children that they would get a better education than he.  And that's what he worked for.  So, every one of my brothers--seven of us survived.  Every one of my brothers and every one of my sisters graduated from high school, which at the time was a great achievement and a great accomplishment.  And then one of my brothers actually received a football scholarship and went to Kentucky State [University in Frankfort, Kentucky] and played on the football team until he was called into the Army, into the service.  And so, but he became the first member of our family to go to college, to actually go to college.  And so, after that then of course I had the opportunity to go, and I went.  And the fact is that it said a great deal about my father. Because at the time that I had become a senior in high school, he had drummed into my head this idea you have to go to college, you have to, you know, you have to improve yourself.  And he'd done such a good job of it that in my senior year, I simply assumed that when I graduated from high school, I was going to college.  It never occurred to me that what happened would happen on the night of my graduation.  We had our family all over to the house, and sort of celebrating that I graduated from high school.  And my father took me into a bedroom and told me, he said, "We don't have the money for you to go to college.  You're not going to be able to go to college."  And I was devastated, because I had just assumed that that was going to follow as the night follows the day, that I would go to college after high school.  And so, I remember saying to my father that night that "I know, I understand that we don't the money to do this."  I said, "But I'm going to college."  We called him Papa.  I said, "Papa, I'm going to college."  And so that summer he got me a job out at Pullman [Pullman Palace Car Company] where he was working, you know, doing labor.  And it was the hardest that I'd ever, ever worked.  Even before I graduated I had a job washing dishes at a local restaurant.  So, I had some idea of working, about getting up in the morning and going, you know, going to work on time.  But I worked all summer at Pullman.  My church, the church that I belonged to, Mount Zion Baptist Church, they took up a collection for me, because they all wanted to see me go to college, and they took up a collection.  And then I got, about halfway through the summer I got some very good news.  I was going to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], and they notified me that I would receive a scholarship to play football and be on the track team.  And that, all of that, coupled with my older sisters who were just fantastic--and they weren't well-off or anything, but the little money that they had--and their husbands were very supportive.  They put all that together and I was able to go down for my first year at Indiana University.
Story_ID: 78186
Speaker 1: And I did, I was on the track team.  I was a member of the track team, and I was a member of the football team, I played on the football team.  And it was absolutely the hardest year of my life, for two reasons.  The level of courses that I had to take was extremely... I was not really prepared for that.  And secondly, the-- I was... football would take four or five hours a day practice, you have to practice.  And it was just like having a job; it was just like going to work.  And when you came home you were sore and whatever, and you really didn't feel like doing anything but collapsing in bed.  And so, after a year of that, I made a decision that I wasn't going to learn very much at Indiana University if I continued on that kind of schedule.  And so, I went to the athlete director, and I asked him that if I dropped football but remained on the track team--which did not take nearly as much time--did not take as much obviously a toll on your body as football did--if I dropped it, could I retain the scholarship?  And he said yes.  They were very kind; they agreed that if I stayed on the track team that...  So, I stayed on the track team for the four years that I was at Indiana University.  I also... athletes were given jobs.  And so, I got a job in the dining hall bussing tables.  And one of the things that I always remember about that experience was that it was critical to be on time.  You had to, you have to be at work on time.  And as a matter of fact, they gave a bonus to the person that was never late, that was always on time.  And I was determined to get that bonus because it was more money, and we needed the money.  And it went to the very last day of the semester, and I had a perfect record.  And I had to take a final examination, and the final examination went five minutes past the time that I was supposed to be able to work.  And so, I got to the dining hall maybe about seven minutes late, seven or eight minutes late.  And I talked to the supervisor and I said, "Surely," I said, "I've been there every time."  I said, "Surely, this is not going to prevent me from getting the bonus?"  She said, "Yes, I'm sorry, that's the rules."  And so I didn't get.  And I always remembered that, and that was a good lesson for me.  Because one of the things that I learned from that was that people do not give you very much latitude.  In other words, don't depend on people doing something out of the kindness of their hearts.  Because it doesn't happen in many instances.  And particularly, I don't think it happens with black people.  And so, I think black people have to strive to be almost perfect if they want to be successful, and if they want to succeed--and that any digression or any falling short of the mark, you're going to pay for that, as I paid by not getting this bonus.  And so, that was a good lesson for me.  It was something that has stayed with me ever since throughout my life, that you have to really try to be as perfect as possible.  No one is perfect, but you have to try, and you have to set your goals so high that you're going to come very close to perfection.
Story_ID: 78187
Speaker 1: And so, my experience at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] ultimately turned out to be a very good experience for me.  I graduated with a degree in government and business, and was determined to go to college--I'm sorry, to go to professional school.  I had an experience in the year that would have been my senior year at Indiana that, again, was one of those setbacks that you run into.  One night I was sitting in my room, in the dormitory.  And my roommate came in with three or four of his friends.  And there were some firecrackers that--when I would go home at Thanksgiving time, my father [Carlton Hatcher] who would always go back to the South every year, would bring back firecrackers from the South--because I'm not sure they sold them in Indiana or Michigan City. And so, but he'd always bring some back.  And I'd taken a handful of those firecrackers back to school with me.  And I just had them up on my desk, the hutch of my desk, as a kind of display.  I had no intentions of setting them off.  Well, when my roommate came in that night with his friends, they saw them and they said, "Why don't we set off some fire... wouldn't it be a great thing?"  Now, this is very late at night.  "Wouldn't it be a great thing if set off one of these firecrackers out in the hallway?"  And it would wake everyone up, you know.  And so, they did; they did.  I did not participate, but I didn't tell them not to, either.  And so they set, they set them off, and then they'd run back in the room and close the door.  And the last time they set one off, this poor fellow next door who had been awakened, sort of came out of his room rubbing his eyes, trying to figure out what was going on.  And the dorm headmaster was coming in the door down at the other end of the hall, and he was the one that he saw.  He didn't see any of these fellows.  And so, we wound up with a situation where a meeting was called about 1:00 a.m. that morning, of all the people in this particular dorm.  And the headmaster said, "Now, whoever did this," he said, "I'm not sure who did it, but whoever did it should step forward, you know, and accept the responsibility."  Well, no one stepped forward, including me.  And the... he finally said, he said, "Well, I saw John coming.  John must have had something to do with it, I saw him coming out of his room."  And so he told John, he said, "I'm going to take you downstairs."  And at that point I finally mustered the moral courage to say, "It wasn't John, it was me.  Those were my firecrackers."  And so, he said, "Fine."  He said, "Everybody else can go back to bed, and you come downstairs."  And I went down to his office with him.  And he opened this manual that said basically anyone on University property using pyrotechnic devices will be expelled from school--just no conditions, just expelled from school.  I was devastated.  I was about to be a senior, about to graduate and he was telling me I was...  So, he finally said...  I said, "Well, when?"  He said, "Immediately."  Immediately?  We were two weeks from finals.  And so, he finally talked to people in the administration.  They finally said, "Well, what we'll do is we'll allow you to stay until the end of the semester to finish your finals.  But you can't stay in any university dorm."  And it just so happened that I had pledged Kappa Alpha Psi, and the Kappas had a house.  And so they told me, they said, "Look, we've got like a loft up in... or an attic.  We can put a bed up there, and you can stay there for, you know, the two weeks so you can take your finals."  And that's what I did.  And after that, I asked "Well, how do I get back in school?  Is there any way of getting back in school?"  And they said, "You have to stay out of school a semester."  And I was so ashamed, and thinking of all that my father had done and my family had done to try to get me to that point that I wouldn't go home.  I would not go home.  I first went down to Louisville [Kentucky], and I had an uncle in Louisville and I stayed with him.  And I begged him don't tell my parents where I was.  And of course, they did.
Story_ID: 78188
Speaker 1: And the-- so, after that, I still was too ashamed to go back to Michigan City [Indiana] and sort of face the people there and all that.  So I came to Chicago [Illinois] to one of my aunts over here.  And she said, "Well, you can stay here.  You can stay here and get a job."  Great experience there, because I had at that point completed, or almost completed three years of college.  And I was trying to get a job so that I could earn enough money and might be able to go back to school in the fall.  And I walked the pavements down in the Loop.  You know, I'd see an ad in the paper and I would call them, and they would say, "Well, yes, we have this opening," and you know, "Can you come in?"  And I would go there, and it could have been my paranoia, but it seems that as soon as they found out that I was black that was the end of it.  You know, "You have too much education for the kind of job that we're talking about here."  Or, "You don't have a degree.  And so, we need a person with a degree."  And it just sort of went like that.  And I became very discouraged.  And my aunt was very encouraging and said, "Well, you know, tomorrow... maybe tomorrow you'll get something."  And, but I finally wound up--I did get a little job bookkeeping.  And it didn't pay very much, but I finally wound up--my family was calling, you know, "You can come home."  You know, "Come home."  And so, I went back to Michigan City.  And in Michigan City I was able to get a job for that summer, and wound up going back to school in the fall and completing, you know, my senior year, being able to complete my senior year.  So, I learned from that experience.  Again, rules, sometimes we tend not to take rules very seriously, which is what I did.  I did not take... and obviously my roommate did not.  They never paid for what happened, but I did, I paid.  That was a great problem for me.  But I did learn, pay attention to rules.  You know, don't assume they're just there because someone wanted to write them down; pay attention to rules.
Story_ID: 78189
Speaker 1: And ultimately I was fortunate enough to be accepted in law school.  I went to Valparaiso University [Valparaiso, Indiana] and I finished my studies there--three years, won a couple of awards, that kind of thing.  Valparaiso at that time when I was a first year student had two blacks in the entire school--myself and another young man.  And unfortunately, at the end of the first year, he flunked out.  So, I wound up being the only black in the law school.  And while I did not experience in the law school many direct incidents of discrimination, it was clear that this was essentially a white world.  This was, I was out of place, you know, in that environment.  When I was a second year student I was invited--as was routine for second year law students--to join a legal fraternity called Phi Alpha Delta.  And I was, I received this invitation just as all second year students received one.  And they had an event where, it was like a social event where you met everyone.  And then after this, the people who were already members would stay, and they would make a decision as to which of the law students they wanted to invite to join this fraternity.  So, I went to this party and had a nice time.  And you know, it never occurred to me that there would be any problem... and I left.  This friend of mine who was white told me that after the party was over, and when they assembled to make this decision--he said they were there all night.  They were up there all night, and the whole argument and discussion was about me--whether I would be admitted to the fraternity or not.  And he told me that... I told him I didn't understand.  I said, "Why would they send me the invitation?"  He said, "Well, they never expected you to come.  That was a matter of form, to send it to you, but they never expected you to take it seriously."  And so, at the end of the... I guess that morning they finally wound up taking a vote, and I was admitted to the thing by one vote, they tell me, by one vote.  But that's, that was Valparaiso.  That was what the law school was like at the time.  That was what the university was like.  There were just very few African-Americans there.  Now, a professor... you know, it's a very different situation at the very law school, as I said, that really did not want me to go on to a fraternity.  So, so, as you see things change, you know, I think it begins to-
Story_ID: 78263
Speaker 1: To just get some, you know, to make some clarification on things.  One, the thirteen children-- where do you fit--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in the mix of things?  And can you give their names?  I was wondering why so many passed, died?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's an excellent question.  First of all, I was next to last.  I have one sister that is younger than I am, and all the others were older.  As I said, seven of us survived.  Out of the thirteen, seven survived, and I asked my father [Carlton Hatcher] and mother [Catherine Hatcher], you know, what happened.  Well, first of all, at that time, when a woman was pregnant she didn't go to a doctor, and, you know, all the things that women do routinely today; they didn't do any of those things.  And usually the children were born at home; they were not born somewhere else.  And two of my brothers--well, my brother and sister were twins, was a set of twins.  And they got to be about one year's old, maybe one year and a month old.  And they were actually crawling on the floor.  Well, this house that we lived in at that time in "The Patch," [Michigan City, Indiana] was a big, open, sort of--it wasn't a very nice house.  In other words, I can remember sleeping, going to sleep at night.  And because there were actually cracks in the walls, I would wake up and there would be like a layer of snow on my bed, because snow had blown in through these cracks.  So, it was a very, you know, it wasn't a very good house to raise children in.  And my father tells me that these twins would crawl on the floor.  And they became ill, and I suspect pneumonia or something like that.  But one of them died today, and two days later the other one died because... and that's what happened with them.  He said that some of my brothers and sisters were stillborn.  And my oldest sister said, again, lack of medical attention, and just knowledge about what you should do.  And so, some of them were stillborn.  Others got to be two, maybe three years old, and then caught a cold or caught some other virus.  And again, you didn't call the doctor almost unless someone had almost dying.  You know, so, I suspect there could have been a chance to save some of them had they gotten medical attention earlier.  But again, my parents, they didn't know about things like that.  They just, you know, didn't know.  And my mother was very, very religious.  She was a member of the Church of God in Christ.  And so, what people would do when someone became ill is they would pray for them.  They would come over to the house and pray for them, as opposed to, you know, getting medical help.  And then there was the cost.  You know, going to the doctor was a very expensive thing.  And those were still days when the doctor would come to your house, but you still had to pay him.  And so, you didn't call the doctor unless you really...  So, it was a mix of all of those things.  Probably if you were to talk about one single factor, it was ignorance.  It was just ignorance of medicine; it was ignorance of what was necessary in order to, you know, save a child, keep a child going.  And you know, again, I don't... obviously it wasn't my parents' fault.  I mean that's, they had grown up... and they were doing the very best, the very best that they could.  But we lost a lot of, you know, our brothers and sisters because of that.
Story_ID: 78264
Speaker 1: Now, you have spoken of your father [Carlton Hatcher].  Your mother, when you mention your mother [Catherine Hatcher], now is that your stepmother or your mother?
Speaker 2: No, it's my mother.
Speaker 1: Your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And can you give her name and tell us--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --about her background and her growing up, and even how your parents met?
Speaker 2: She was, she lived in Lizella [Georgia].  They both lived in the same little town.  And so they knew each other from just growing up; they knew each other.  Her name was Catherine.  And my middle girl--I have three daughters--the middle girl is named after her.  And she, she was, I guess we always tend to remember your mother as a saint, literally as a saint.  I can see her face now, just glowing, you know.  She, she was just a wonderful person.  She died when I was thirteen years old, and she died of cancer.  And she would take us to church.  Her church was the Church of God in Christ, a sanctified church.  And we spent most of our time in church.  We went on Sunday, we went to the Sunday school.  And then after Sunday school we went to church.  And after church that afternoon they had Sunday afternoon service.  And then we came back that evening for BTU.  And so, and then during the week they had prayer meeting, and the kids all went.  We'd fall asleep on the benches and all that, but we were in church more almost than we were anywhere else.  And it was my mother, you know, who insisted on that.  My father was Baptist, and so he went, he would take us to church in the morning and drop us off at the sanctified church and then he would go to his church, which was Mount Zion [Missionary Baptist Church in Michigan City, Indiana].  Well, when my mother died, then he took us--we still were very young... I had a sister that was twelve.  And as I said, I was thirteen.  And so, my father then took us to the Baptist church, and that's how I wound up becoming a Baptist.  But my mother was a hard worker.  She worked in a place--and I'm sure, you know, this is where her health problems came from.  She worked in a place called Blocksom's [Blocksom & Co.] in Michigan City, which processed animal hair.  They made cushions for cars and other kinds of things, with animal hair.  And I would go down there sometimes on my lunch hour from school.  I would go down there and run errands, because a lot of black women worked in this factory.  The odor was absolutely overwhelming.  It was unbelievable even to me as young as I was that someone could work in that, you know, in that environment.  But that's where my mother worked.  And they had to sort of pull these hairs and shape them and, you know, put them into these cushions and so forth.  And it was a very, very unsanitary place.  Even... again, as young as I was, I remember that--how unsanitary it was.  And as I said, my mother would have me run errands to go get pop or a sandwich or something, you know, for all of them down there.  And that's, I really believe there were carcinogens, you know, in that processing of these hairs because they treated them with chemicals and so forth.  And my, I'm just convinced that that's what killed my mother.  But she worked there for many years.  And she was, as I... she was very much respected in the community, as was my father.
Story_ID: 78265
Speaker 1: People actually thought my father [Carlton Hatcher] was a minister because he was very religious.  And they would come to him, people in the neighborhood would come to him when they had problems and ask him what they should do.  And he would sit and talk with them.  And many times when people needed help financially, he would loan them money.  And so, we were used to people coming to our house and, you know, spending time with our family.  And my mother [Catherine Hatcher] was a fantastic cook.  You know, we always had three meals.  I mean they were... surprisingly, as much as people have today, many times they don't have three meals; they don't get three meals.  But we always had... we had breakfast, we had lunch, and we always had dinner.  Now, many...  I got to know Karo Syrup and those things very well, and beans and all that.  So, it wasn't elaborate, but we had something.  We always had something at least three times a day.  And even when my father--when the plant was closed down and my father wasn't working, other than as I said, collecting junk and selling it--even then we would go...  They called it relief then.  It would be the equivalent I suspect of what a township trustee does today.  But once a month, you could go up to this office, and you get what they called surplus.  You might get a bag of grapefruits.  And you got powder and you got sugar.  And you know, in bulk like that, and bring them home.  That was, that was like Christmas every month for us.  It was, that was a great time.  And you had fruit and things like that.  So, my family made it with what they had.  They didn't have very much of anything.  But they took it.  And my father, I don't recall ever a time my father being discouraged, or my mother saying, "Oh, we just, we don't..." I never recall a time like that.  They always seemed... "God will provide, God will take care of us.  You know, we don't have to worry about that, because God will take care of us."  And he did, I mean there's no question about it.  So, my mother was, she was a quiet person.  And but, you know, she was, at least to me, she was a very wise person.  And she just took care of us.  I mean there was just never anything that you really needed that they wouldn't find a way to get it.  And I was still in grade school, but I wanted to take piano lessons.  And I went to school, and they had a teacher at the grade school that taught music.  And so, if you wanted to take piano lessons, you could go to the teacher.  The teacher would give you assignments, though, that you were to practice at home, on the piano at home.  The obvious problem was that we didn't have a piano at home, and certainly could not afford to buy one.  And so for a while, I would practice on a cardboard cut-out of a piano keyboard.  That's how I would try to learn the notes, on this.  And so, the teacher realized that I wasn't, you know, obviously wasn't getting the job done.  And so, she arranged with the principal--which at that time was sort of unusual--she arranged for him to allow me to come on my lunch hour at noon and practice on the school piano.  And so that helped, that helped a lot.  But I still wanted this piano.  It was like a dream, that I wanted a piano.  And so, my father started looking--as I said, he used to go around and collect junk.  So he started looking for someone that might have a piano that they didn't want anymore.  And we'd look in the newspaper and see if there was any piano advertised.  Finally, one day he came home and he said he'd found one.  He said he found one, somebody had thrown it out, an old piano.  And so he arranged with someone that he knew that had a pickup truck to go and pick up that piano and bring it to our house.  And it, it could have been a Baby Grand, so far as I was concerned.  It was so incredible that I actually had a piano, a piano at home.  But he didn't have to pay anything for it.  And so it was that kind of thing where they tried to meet the, not just the needs of their children, but the wants of their children.  I still remember many Christmas when, you know, you'd get so excited, "Oh, Christmas is coming, I'm going to get presents," and things like that.  And you'd only get one or two, maybe get one or two presents.  And, and I remember how disappointed I was, you know, that I didn't get a lot of Christmas gifts.  But my family did the very best that they could for us, for all of us.  And so, you know, it was sort of alright.

Speaker 1: We were really poor.  But as people say, we were poor, but we didn't know we were poor.  I mean, we did not have the benefit of a sociologist and a psychologist writing about, you know, our deprived condition.  And so, we didn't know that we were really poor, because everyone around us in our neighborhood, they were in pretty much the same situation.  In fact, we were a little better off.  One of the things that happened with us was that... if you had an extra room you always took in a boarder, a roomer.  And we had a couple living in our house who ultimately wound up owning the first television set in the neighborhood.  No one else had a TV set.  So, my little friends would come over and we would sit...  Because we'd always have to wait until Mr. Ben... that was... until Mr. Ben got home from work before you could turn on the television.  But they would come over and we would sit on the floor and we would watch television.  It was mostly wrestling, that's what you watched.  But that was the only one in the whole neighborhood.  Nobody else had a TV set.  And so, we had things, as poor as we were, that other people simply did not have.  And I recall the radio was a big thing, listening to the radio.  And we did have a radio; we had a radio.  We listened to the Lone Ranger and all of those things.  And so, while life was really difficult, you know, from an objective point of view, it was, I was not unhappy.  I grew up, you know, very... feeling very secure, very confident.  I knew my parents [Carlton and Catherine Hatcher] loved me, I knew they cared about me.  And they would do anything, you know, to try to help me.  And so, that gave me a sense of great confidence--a feeling that my father was always talking about, "You can be great.  You can do lots of things."  You know, and I believed that; I bought into that very much.

Speaker 1: So, so my brothers wound up going to the military.  One brother served up in Alaska for the entire duration of the Second World War [World War II].  And another brother went to Europe to, it was the Battle of the Bulge and all of that; he was involved in that.  But they didn't... like thankfully they didn't allow blacks on the front line at that time, to fire real guns.  And so, he, it was his job just to drive a truck.  And when people would be killed, when soldiers would be killed, his job was to go up and pick up the bodies and load them on the truck and bring them, you know, back to where they could be processed.  So, but they served until the war was over.  They were in the military until the war was over.  And I had a brother-in-law who... we hear about Jackie Robinson and a lot of other people who broke the color line in baseball.  I had a brother-in-law that... I'm not going to say he was as good as Jackie Robinson, but he was a great baseball player.  But at that time, again, there was no...  So, he played, he played in the Negro semi-pro leagues.  He played with the Pittsburgh Crawfords, and he was a great baseball player, and he was also a great person.  And I think much of my interest in public affairs, and particularly in issues relating to race relations and discrimination in this country, were a direct result of... I would go over...  For a while he and my sister, they lived in the same house with us.  And then they finally got to the point where they could afford to buy their own little house.  So, I would go over to his house.  And we would sit and talk for hours and hours about everything.  And because he had sort of traveled a little and seen, you know, much more of the world than I'd ever seen, he knew about things that I didn't know about.  And so, we would just talk about everything.  We would just sit there; I'd sit on the floor, he'd sit in the chair and we'd just talk about these things.  And much of my... again my... first of all my commitment to equality and justice, and my commitment to the proposition that black people are every bit as good as anybody else and ought to be treated that way and ought to have the same opportunities--much of that came from these sort of midnight conversations with my brother-in-law.  His name was Emmett Wise.  And so, we... all those things were going on as I was growing up.
Story_ID: 78268
Speaker 1: And my father [Carlton Hatcher] always told me about an education, "Get your education.  Get your education.  Once you get it, no one can take that away from you.  Once you have it, no one can take that away from you."  And I had an experience in high school.  I think that... as I said, I was working at this restaurant washing dishes.  And at that time there were no automatic dishwashers, so you simply washed the dishes right behind the counter.  And I had... frankly, the thought had never occurred to me that this restaurant where all the waitresses and the chef and all that--they treated me just fine.  I was on the football team in high school, so in a small town like Michigan City [Indiana] if you were a football player or an athlete, you were a hero.  I mean all over town, everybody sort of knew you.  So that's why this guy gave me this job in the restaurant, because I was on the football team.  And so, I was washing dishes.  And one day... this restaurant was right on a through highway that goes through Michigan City.  And one day this couple came in.  And they sat down, and I didn't pay any attention at first.  But then I noticed that they'd been sitting there a long time, and no one had served them.  And so I finally called a waitress--you know, we were good friends, we joked all the time.  And I said, "Those people haven't been served."  I said, "You know, would you go over?"  And she just looked, I mean she gave me that look of a deer caught, you know, in a headlight.  And she didn't say anything, she just went straight back into the kitchen where the manager was.  He was the manager and the cook back there.  And she went back.  And then I saw him come out and go over to this table where this couple was.  And he said something to them.  They were too far away for me to hear them.  And he said something to them, and then they got up and left.  And so, I asked him, I said, "What happened?"  I said, "Why did they leave?  Why..."  And he said, "It's not my policy.  In fact, I'm telling you right now it's the owner of the restaurant."  He said, "If it were me, they would have been served."  And when I realized that they were, had been turned away because of their color, I... the most dramatic thing that I could think to do was to rip off my apron; I had an apron for washing dishes.  I ripped off my apron and threw it on the floor, and I said, "I quit."  And I walked out, I left and I went home.  And on the way home I knew--I said when my father hears this I know he's going to tell me that I did the right thing, because that's the way he is.  And so when I got home and I walked in the house, my father said the owner of the restaurant had already called the house, had already called him, you know, to try to get him to get me to come back to work.  And he sat down and he started talking to me.  And he said, "I know that you feel that the best thing to do is to just quit and just leave, that they would do something like that."  And he said, "I understand that.  That's the way I feel about something like that."  He said, "But you have to think about the fact that you are trying to get something.  You're trying to get an education, and you want to go to school.  You need a job, you need to be working."  And he kept talking.  And I said, "Well, you can't... you can't be telling me that you want me to go back, you know."  He said, "That's exactly what I'm telling you."  And he talked and talked, and finally he--you know, he showed me the larger picture.  And so, I went back; I went back to work.  They called for two or three days, but I finally said, "Okay, I'll come back."  And I went back and I finished out my senior year working there.
Story_ID: 78269
Speaker 1: Went to college [Indiana University in Bloomington].  After I came... when I came home for the summer of my first year in college, I organized a sit-in, the first sit-in in the history of Michigan City [Indiana].  I organized a sit-in in that restaurant [Brownie's Griddle, where he had worked as a dishwasher], and I got a bunch of my friends, and we went up there and we just sat down in the booth.  And the restaurant was a very popular place also, because it was right around the corner from City Hall.  So the mayor, policemen, all kinds of people came to eat there.  But we went in and we sat down.  And we said, you know, "We'd like to order a meal."  We'd scraped together a few dollars just in case.  And we said, "We'd like to order a meal."  And so they said, "Well, we can't serve... if you want to go back in the kitchen we can serve you back there.  You know, we'll be glad... but we can't serve you out here."  And so, we said, "Well, we're not leaving, then.  We're just going to sit here until you close."  And we did.  We went the first night, second night.  The reaction was just anger, you know.  They said, "Well, we're going to call the police and have all of you arrested."  We said, "Well, you know, if that's what has to happen, that's what has to happen."  But after it went on for two weeks... that every evening we would come and sit.  And no one could occupy those booths.  Their regular customers could not, because we were sitting there.  Finally, one day I was at home, and I received a call from the owner.  And the owner said, "Alright, you can have..."  You know, he said, "We're going to, we're going to change our policy."  So, I called all these people who had kind of been telling me that nothing was going to happen.  I said, "Why don't we go down to Arnie's and have a meal?  Why don't we go and eat?"  And so we all went and, you know, we were served.  But that was sort of, you know, my first real involvement in protests and what protests can accomplish.  Because by the time he broke, the entire black community in Michigan City was supporting us, you know, and was urging us to continue to hold these sit-ins.  Down at IU [Indiana University], I have participated...  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was picketing a place, and it was amazing.  They wouldn't even serve... on campus you were fine, as long as you were on campus.  But when you were off campus...  There was a restaurant and tavern right off campus called Nick's Old English Pub [Nick's English Hut].  And the NAACP chapter on the IU campus organized a demonstration.  And so they called for volunteers, and I was one of the volunteers.  And you would have classes... like if you had classes in the morning but you had a couple hours free before your next class, then you'd go down and carry a picket sign in front of Nick's for two hours.  And students, you know, did that, and we did that all semester, all semester long.  And it gets cold in Bloomington in the winter, but Nick's finally had to, you know, concede and start serving... for the first time start serving blacks, you know, in there.  You couldn't get your hair cut in Bloomington, because there was only one black barber in the entire city, and he only cut white people's hair.  And you couldn't go to the white... you know, and get your hair cut.  So, I had a roommate who was a football player.  And one day he and two or three other football players said, "We're going to get a haircut."  They went down to this barber in downtown Bloomington.  And they were big, and they came in and they said, "We want a haircut."  And he started to explain, "We don't cut... you know..."  And they said, "I don't care what... we want a haircut, or we're going to turn this place out."  And so, he was frightened.  And he put this one guy in... this guy was an all-American football player, and they put him in the chair.  And he said, "Well, I don't know how to cut black people's hair."  And he said, "Well, you just do the best you can," a statement which he lived to regret.  Because this man gave him like a Mohawk cut--shaved on both sides and this line of hair, you know, in the middle.  Truly upset, truly upset.  I think that the barbers all ran out of the shop (laughter).  And, but, after that they all cut black people's hair, they opened them up.
Story_ID: 78238
Speaker 1: The black barber who would not cut black people's hair, he would tell you, said, "If you will come--you know, after I close the shop and come around to the back, not come in the front door.  So, I don't want my white customers seeing you.  Come around to the back door, then I'll cut your hair."  And a few people did it that.  I could never bring myself to do that, because I felt that that was so demeaning, you know.  Here was a black who was cutting... and he was going right along with this.  So, so, when these football players sort of upset the apple cart that opened the way for all of us to be able to go to whatever barber shop we wanted to go to and get our hair cut.  And the thing that happened on campus while I was there as a freshman at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] was that the Commons, the place where--the Union Building, where students in-between classes and so forth came to have a Coke and sit around and talk and to do whatever--it was sort of the social gathering place for the entire campus.  That had a sign about halfway back that said, "Colored," you know, behind this sign.  And a new chancellor had just come in when I was a freshman, a new chancellor [Herman B. Wells].  And he, in a very dramatic way, went to this place and put a ladder up.  And he climbed up the ladder, which was an achievement, because he was kind of a heavy, very heavy man.  But he climbed up the ladder and ripped the sign down, and declared that there would never be anything like that.  You couldn't have a white roommate at that time.  He changed all of that so that you, you know, you could if you chose to.  So, so, Indiana University itself was in transition while I was there.  And I was so happy that I had the opportunity to see what, in effect, was segregation and discrimination ended on campus, but also ended out in Bloomington, you know, as it had been.
Story_ID: 78239
Speaker 1: And again, they were really good people.  I remember the student who was the head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at that time.  And he was a great organizer.  He was from Gary [Indiana].  And he got all the students organized, got their schedules and, you know, had someone who was responsible for making sure that every hour of the day was covered with the picketers when we were working at Nick's [Nick's English Hut].  He had great skills.  He ultimately went to law school and became a lawyer.  There was one individual who was a student down there, and he was blind.  His name was John Ward, and he was a top student.  And John was like up to his elbows, you know, in civil rights activities and that kind of thing.  So, we had some really interesting people at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] at that time.  And even though things--certainly you began to become aware of what was going on in other places around the country, and particularly in the South.  But there was a, there was an initiative that sort of developed sort of independently of whatever was going on anywhere else.  Now, one of the things I always think about... because we were blessed with some truly great people--obviously some of those that are really well known and some who aren't all that well-known.  But when you think of a [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], when I think of a [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson--their value I think to us was not so much and is... not so much what they did.  Martin Luther King led marches and demonstrations, and did things like that.  But I think their value to us is that they inspired us to be better than we would have been otherwise.  They let us know that you can be more than people think that you can be.  And so, to me, to have a Jesse Jackson, to have a Malcolm X--to have people who really confronted, you know, this racist system and said, "No, you can treat everybody else that way.  You will not treat me that way."  That is inspirational.  To me, when we think about our history makers they're people who inspired us, all the rest of us, to be more than we would have been if they had not come along.  And so, you know, in that sense we have people all over the place--as I said, some who are well known... some who are not so well-known.  I'm trying to think of the name of this young woman who, when they were planning the Birmingham boycott--that was when Rosa Parks, when Rosa Parks was arrested and taken to jail [December 1, 1955].  And when the NAACP... the NAACP said, "Well, we have to do something about this."  And they called and said, "You know, we're going to have this rally tomorrow night."  The problem was, of course, we didn't have televisions, and we didn't have all those things to communicate with each other and to let each other know.  But this young woman who was a teacher in a junior college there, went out to her school that night and used one of those hand cranked copying machines, and ran off thousands of leaflets that were then distributed, you know, throughout the black community that next day.  So, that night the church was packed, the church was absolutely packed.  And so, when you, when you think about the people who are not famous or not on television, but who... if they had not done the things they did, it wouldn't have happened.  Or, it certainly would not have happened as quickly.  So, so we have some incredible people, and we have people whose stories need to be told.
Story_ID: 78240
Speaker 1: For example, if you were to ask me who was the greatest civil rights fighter in your life, who was that?  I mean who was the...?  I'd say my father [Carlton Hatcher].  I mean, nobody knows my father, nobody knows anything about him.  And yet I know what he believed in, and I know how strong he was in circumstances where he was literally... his life was at risk.  And he passed that on to us.  He, he, he managed in spite of no education, no degrees, no whatever... to pass that on to us.  And so, he had far and away the greatest influence, you know, on my life.  [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] inspired me, [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson inspires me, [HM] Maxine Waters inspires me.  I mean, there are people that absolutely...  But if you talk about who really influenced... who got you off the wrong track and onto the right track on this issue of race and race relations, I'd have to say my father.  I'd say next my brother-in-law [Emmett Wise], you know.  There are people like that I suspect in everyone's life who managed to--
Story_ID: 78241
Speaker 1: I grew up, as I said, in "the Patch," which was not a really nice part of town [Michigan City, Indiana].  I would have very easily wound up in jail, wound up doing all kinds that I shouldn't have done.  But there was one man that...  There was something called the Elite Youth Center in Michigan City.  And the Methodist Church funded it, the local Methodist church funded it.  And all the Elite Youth Center was, was a small gymnasium.  And then downstairs under the church was a large room where you could play ping pong, and they even had some books you could read and that kind of thing.  I went to the Elite Youth-- after I did my chores at home.  Like most of the kids in our neighborhood, I went to the Elite Youth Center.  There was a man there named Charles Westcott.  And Charlie Westcott had played for Johnson C. Smith, played basketball for Johnson C. Smith [University in Charlotte, North Carolina].  Even though he was a very... he was only about 5 foot 5 or five foot 6, but they tell me he'd been really a good basketball player.  And he was, because he had always... whenever one of us would challenge him, you know, to a shoot-around or something, he always won.  He was very good.  But Charlie Westcott was so much more than that.  Because he was the one that was talking to us.  I mean, we had gangs and we had all of that stuff going on outside the Elite Youth Center.  He would not let any of that come in there.  He would not tolerate it, he would not stand for it.  So, when you went there, you knew that you had to behave and you had... otherwise, I mean, the worse thing...  If you're a Catholic and you're kicked out of the Catholic Church, that's a terrible thing to happen.  For us, kids growing up there, to be kicked out of the Elite Youth and to be told you can't come back here anymore, that was the equivalent.  That... that was... that was the equivalent.  So, so, Charlie Westcott talking to us... and you know, just talking informally got me and many other young people... sort of steered me away from disaster, steered me away from disaster and got me going in the right direction.  So, people... again, I'm not sure even people in Michigan City... how many people in Michigan City know about or remember Charlie Westcott.  But I'll never forget him.
Story_ID: 78242
Speaker 1: Let me ask... speaking of your youth, I want to understand what the young Richard Hatcher was like.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What would you, I mean what did you dream about?  You know, were you quiet and shy?  Were you precocious?  Were you a thinker?  I mean, what, what were you like?
Speaker 2: Well, probably the first thing I would say is that my father [Carlton Hatcher] took me to lunch one day, to a little cafe.  It was amazing to me, because I guess I was about maybe 15 or 16 years old.  And he'd never taken me to... we didn't go out to lunch or breakfast, that's something that we didn't do.  But we took me to lunch one day and we were talking, we were just talking.  And he sort of came up with, "Well, Son, what do you want to do?  What do you want to be, or what do you want to become?"  And I remember telling him that, "If I could just become half the man you are."  I said, "If I can just become half the man you are, then I will feel that I have, you know, my life has been a great life."   And so he... and I really meant that.  I mean, I wasn't just saying something.  I mean, I really meant that.  Because to me, to become the kind of person that he was...  He was really respected in the community.  You know, people would say "Well, you know, don't talk to Mr. Carl because he's going to be talking... the first thing he's going to ask you is "When is the last time you went to church?  "What church do you belong to?"  That was the way he was.  And so, he was a person greatly respected.  As poor as we were, if he needed to borrow money in order--you know, if someone was sick and you had a big medical bill or something and he had to borrow money, he would go down--he took me with him one time.  He would go down to the bank downtown, and the president of the bank would sit and talk with him.  And, and, and, he would tell him, "Well, Carl, what do you need?"  And he might say "Well, I have to borrow five hundred dollars."  And he'd say, "Alright, when do you need it?"  And the amazing thing... my father could not write, you know.  And, and, the amazing thing is that that bank would loan him money without signing anything or whatever.  They just loaned him the money.  And the president would shake his hands.  And he always paid it back, and he paid it back on time.  You know, that was...  But he was just highly respected.
Story_ID: 78243
Speaker 1: My father [Carlton Hatcher] was almost eighty years old when he learned to read.  He was almost eighty years old when he learned to read.  He came over here to Chicago [Illinois] to Operation PUSH one time.  And he wanted to... [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson, you know, appealed to people to give money.  And, and Jesse called him up on the stage.  And he told Jesse, he said, "I want to write a check to PUSH."  He said, "But I need you to sign it for me.  I need you... because I can't, you know, sign it."  And Jesse signed, Jesse signed the check for him for PUSH.  And Jesse always told... he told me that story afterwards.  He said, "You know, your father came on day..."  So, out of that, he wanted to learn to read and learn to write.  He wanted to learn to read so that he could read the Bible.  And he wanted to learn to write so that he could like, you know, when he had to do some business he could write it himself; he wouldn't have to ask someone else to do it for him.  And so, he went back to school.  He was like eighty-one years old, and he went back to school.  And they had a little program in Michigan City [Indiana] for people who wanted to, you know, come back.  And he went back to school, and he learned to read and he learned to write.  And, and the manifestation of that was that... when... every holiday--Thanksgiving, Christmas, whenever the family gathered--my father always gave the prayer, you know.  And it was powerful, and it was long.  (Laughter).  You know, he gave this prayer.  But he always wanted to be able to read a couple verses of the Bible before he gave the prayer.  And I remember the first time that he was able to do that.  He was able to take the Bible, open it up, and read.  And that, as I said, he was like about eighty-two, eighty-two years old.  But that was the kind of person that he was, and he was highly respected.  So, so for me growing up, he was a perfect role model.  He was someone that I respected, I looked up to... I appreciated.  He had all of the virtues it seems to me that a young boy, you know, trying to make his way needed.  And the same, of course, was true of all my brothers and sisters.  I mean, he was, he was not like partial to any one of us.  And so, that's what I remember most about growing up.
Story_ID: 78244
Speaker 1: I remember very much about in elementary school, that when we were in elementary school, that I could... you know I had friends who were white, because most of the people in the school were white.  And I had friends, and we were good friends.  And we would go, there was one hill in town that when the snow came it was a perfect place for sliding, you know, sliding down.  So, we'd all go out in the evening and slide the Eighth Street hill.  We had a great time out there, and we were really good friends.  But I remember that when we left elementary school and went to junior high school--we call it middle school today.  But junior high school... that somehow these friends that we had, they went in one direction and we went in another.  In other words, we were no longer friends.  We were no longer close friends.  And it was just like someone had created a fork in the road.  And the blacks went one way and the whites went another way, so we were no longer friends.  And that's something that has always stuck with me, how truly separate this country is.  We, we, we talk about being a democratic society, and we do work with each other from time to time, and we have contact.  But we are truly two separate people, and we're two separate societies.  And most people don't like to hear that, because sort of the dream is that everyone regardless of race and color, you know, will sort of be one; color really will not matter, we'll be color-blind.  But the reality is that that's not true.  That is absolutely not true--

Speaker 1: I teach a class at Indiana University [Northwest in Gary, Indiana].  And one of the things that I reminded--just at the end of this semester.  But I said to the students--and they didn't realize it, they didn't realize.  When the class began, they were interspersed--whites, blacks were mixed throughout the room and sitting in all different parts of the room.  But it was almost as if some magic hand was working as the semester went on.  And more and more when students came in, the black students sat on this side and the whites sat on that side.  And I mean there wasn't anything said, or you know, "Don't sit there," or "I don't..." nothing like that.  Just... so by the time the semester ended a few days ago, I told them.  I said, "I want to tell you something that I think is going to surprise you."  I said, "You have created in this room a perfectly segregated situation."  And I told different students--I said, "Mary, when class started, you sat over in that corner on that side.  Now, you're over here."  "Sally, when class started, you know, you were over there.  But now, the blacks are on one side, the whites are on another side."  And I think that's the reality of our society.  And why does that happen?  I think it happens because we are structured.  I mean, these institutions that we have are structured in such a way that no one has to tell us.  No one had to tell those students which side of the room to sit on.  I mean, that was something that was a natural kind of thing that they chose, they chose to do.  And that's what makes it so difficult to overcome racism.  Because it's not just the fact that something--as we saw just the other day, Senator Trent Lott made these comments about the fact that if this man who ran on a truly racist platform in 1988 [sic, 1948] or whenever Strom Thurmond--that he if had been elected president of the United States, this would be a better country than it is--we wouldn't have all the problems that we have.  This is a man running... now here's a man who's going to be the third or fourth in line to actually to running the whole country saying this.  This is the majority leader in the Senate.  This is the man who's going to have, wield great power.  And yet in an unguarded moment--because he said well, he just got carried away in his praise for Strom Thurmond.  Now, but in an unguarded moment, the truth came out--the true feeling that he had about this whole business.  And put aside all the rhetoric, you know, about equality and justice for all.  No, the truth came out.  And the truth was that he felt the country would be better off today with a president who was a segregationist and believed in treating people differently based upon their race.  So, it's there.  We like to cover it up, but it's there.
Story_ID: 78246
Speaker 1: But, let me, can you state the schools that you went to?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I went to Park School, elementary school, and that was K through 6, kindergarten through six.  Then I went to Isaac C. Elston Junior High School and Isaac C. Elston Senior High School.  So, the junior high and the senior high were named the same, after the same man.  And I graduated from Isaac C. Elston where I did play football; I was a member of the football team.  I was on the track team in high school.  And I actually went out for the basketball team in junior high school.  And we'd never had a black on the basketball team.  Because at that time, again, it seems ridiculous at this point.  But the feeling was that blacks were not intelligent enough to play basketball, that basketball was a sport that required you to think and all that, and that blacks simply--you know, they were physical, but they couldn't play.  And I remember a young man that was, that came along two years after I did.  And he was, as a matter of fact he was the nephew of my brother-in-law [Emmett Wise].  And he was the first black to be allowed to play on the basketball team.  And of course, he was just a super player.  But he was the first one that was allowed to play.  And so, when I went out for basketball in junior high school--and they have this process where they cut a certain number of people over a period of the first couple of weeks.  I always got cut, I was always cut, as did every other black.  And so, so that's something that I always remember about junior high school, that I got cut.  They would let you play football, of course, as long as you didn't want to play quarterback.  You didn't think about playing quarterback, but you could... they felt that physically you could do all these other things and play football.  So, I played football and track, since track is an individual sport; it just depends on, you know, if you're good enough to beat the next person.  You know, there were lots of blacks on the track team, a lot of us on the track team.  But those kinds of things, as I look back on them now, it's almost hard to believe that that kind of ignorance existed, and yet it did, and yet it did.  In my senior year when I was going...  The big deal of course is the prom, going to the prom.  And so, I'm sorry, my junior--I was a junior.  And, and one day I was called in by this guidance counselor.  And she asked, she said, "How would you like to go to the prom?"  And I said, "Well, I'd like to."  But I said, "Juniors aren't allowed to go to the prom.  You know, only seniors can go to the prom."  She said, "Well, don't worry about that.  So, would you like to go?"  And so, I said, "Well, of course, of course I'd like to go to the prom."  And so, there was this young lady who was a senior.  And I guess somehow with the match-up, you know, the number of blacks in the senior class, she was sort of the odd person out.  There wasn't a black male for her to go to the prom with.  And so, what they had decided was they were going to waive this rule that had been in existence for all these years, and they were going to allow me to go to the prom.  And of course, when I found out that's what they were doing--and sometimes I regret it, because this young lady wound up not going to the prom.  But I told them "Absolutely not."  I said, "I'm not going to, you know, I'm not going to be used, you know, in that way."  But that was sort of a natural thing.  When you came to high school, from junior high school in Michigan City [Indiana], the guidance counselor would always tell the young black girls that they should take a home economics course, "Because you know that when you get out of school you're going to be cooking in a kitchen.  So, you should take this home..."  They always told us that we should take shop, that we should take shop so that we could learn to work with our hands and so forth.  And I told this lady, I said, "No, my father [Carlton Hatcher] wants me to take the academic course."  "Well, no, I'm not sure that would be good for you, Richard.  I think that if you take shop, you'll be able to get a job and work."  I had to actually bring my father up to the school to get them to allow me to take the academic course in high school.  Because they had simply routinely routed blacks--and probably some of them with IQ's of 150, 160.  But they routed them to the vocational course where they would take courses like shop and so forth.  So, so that was, that was the reality of Michigan City.  That was the reality of many other places around the country at the time.  And again, the only reason that changed, the only reason that changed is because there were people out there, you know, like [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson, other people who got out there and just challenged that whole racist arrangement and system.
Story_ID: 78270
Speaker 1: We could not eat together as a team.  If we went in, you know, if the coach took all of us in, the fact that there were one or two blacks of us would be enough that they would say, "Well, we can't serve them.  You know, we can't serve them."  And so, to his credit, the coach, you know, would take everybody out.  And what... he established the practice... we would come... no matter where we went--we would go to Goshen [Indiana], Elkhart [Indiana]--wherever we went to play,  we would always come back to Michigan City [Indiana] to a little place called the Eighth Street Cafe.  And we'd come back there where the whole team, the whole team would be able to eat together.  So, there were not very many--as I said, on the basketball team, none, until you know, Billy Wright became a member of the basketball team.  And he was far and away the best player in the school, you know.  And that sort of barely got him on the team.  And then the track team, there were more blacks on the track team.  I'd said maybe ten percent of the track team was black, maybe at least ten percent.
Story_ID: 78271
Speaker 1: Now, when you went to Indiana University [Bloomington, Illinois], how many, what were the ratios there at the school?  Was it a big difference?  I know in law school there were only, you know, a few others.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I would put it this way.  From kindergarten through professional school, I have never sat in a classroom when there was more than, say, two other blacks in the classroom, I've never--kindergarten, elementary, junior high, or high school.  It's always been a situation where the people were overwhelmingly white.  Law school [Valparaiso University Law School in Valparaiso, Indiana] in particular, as I said at one point I wound up--law school was three years.  I wound up being the only black in the entire school, you know, for a period of time.  So, there had never been any large percentage of blacks, you know, in the class.  And I tell people, I said, you know, I'm not sure what that means.  Because I think that I'd probably gotten a fairly decent education.  And so, the question of did I get a decent education because I was in an environment that was literally overwhelmingly a white environment?  Or, you know, did I get a decent education because I worked hard and I, you know, I did the things I needed to do?  I'm not sure, not sure what that means when I hear this debate about... say, "Well, you know, if the class is ninety percent, or, all black--or if the schools are all black, kids can't learn."  I don't buy that.  I mean, I absolutely do not, do not buy that.  I think that one of the things that we have to do--and I never had this great feeling; it's contrary obviously to my own experience.  I never had this experience that it was necessary to sit in a classroom with whites in order to do well.  I never, I've always believed that in Gary [Indiana] we have a number of schools, you know, that are close to a hundred percent black.  And I think it is an excuse to suggest that the mere fact that you have this high percentage of blacks in the class is somehow a detriment to them being able to learn or be able to excel and be excellent.  So, I don't believe that.  I don't believe that.  But my own experience, as I said, has simply been one where I was always in a classroom where the teacher was always white, and never had a black teacher or a professor.  That has been my experience.  But as I said, I don't believe that that... I don't believe that signifies anything, I really don't.
Speaker 1: But the converse of that it's that you were used to dealing in a white world?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you were comfortable.
Story_ID: 78272
Speaker 1: Was it your sister who played a major role on you going to law school, if I get the story right?
Speaker 2: Going to law school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: But you said that she had worked for the only black lawyer in town.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But I'm just wondering--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, how you made that decision, and what were your thoughts at the time that you made that decision?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what you wanted to do, and how you wound up choosing Valparaiso [University Law School in Valparaiso, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, when I was in elementary school I would go up to the office of the only black lawyer in town, Canola Graves [ph.].  And my sister would send me on errands, you know, to go pick up lunch or go do something.  And so I was exposed not only to, you know, to that law office environment, I was exposed to him.  And he was a, he was probably at the time the most sophisticated, the most eloquent, the most articulate person that I'd ever seen.  I just used to enjoy hearing him talk, just listening to him talk.  And so, yes, I think at that age and that point in my life, I began to want to be a lawyer.  Because there were two things in the black community that even white people seemed to respect.  One was the doctor--and we had one black doctor, Dr. Jones--and the lawyer, Canola Graves [ph.].  And he was so, you know, he could just talk to anybody.  Nobody could out-talk him, or whatever.  And so, that was very impressive to me.  And my sister, of course, always encouraged me, you know, that the law was, you know, a great profession.  And she tried to help me, you know, wherever she could.  So, yeah, so I would say that... that was certainly the genesis of my having decided I wanted to go to law school.  Now, interestingly, after I got out of high school and after learning that I almost wasn't going to go to college, and it getting worked out so that I could go to college...  After I'd been in college for a year, maybe it was even the first semester, my family--because the black community had huge respect for doctors.  Doctors... when the doctor came to the house, people would actually whisper, I mean, "Oh, the doctor is here."  You know, they wouldn't...  and they had so much respect for doctors that I guess it was the dream of every family that we'll have... someone in our family will become a doctor.  And so, my family--my father [Carlton Hatcher] and my sisters--everybody, "Why don't you be a doctor?  Why don't you become a doctor?"  And so, I said, "Well, okay, if you all want me to be a doctor, I'll be a doctor."  And I started taking courses.  And that's when I became sober and came to my senses.  I took courses like chemistry, where there were like three hundred people in the class, you know.  You miss one class, forget it.  I mean, you weren't...  And most importantly, I learned that I didn't like it.  I didn't enjoy... science was not where I wanted to be and what I enjoyed.  And so, I came home that Thanksgiving for Thanksgiving break, and I told my father, I said, "I don't want to be a doctor.  I want to change my major.  I want to major in pre-law.  That's... I want to be a lawyer, that's what I want to be."  And so my father was disappointed, as well as, you know, the other members of my family.  But you know, they said, "Well, that's, if that's what you want to do, then that's what you should do."  So, so, I think I had that in my mind going all the way back to the time, you know, that I would run errands for Lawyer Graves and my sister.
Story_ID: 78273
Speaker 1: Now, what were the things in law school [Valparaiso University Law School in Valparaiso, Indiana] that you found surprising?  I mean, you graduated with honors.
Speaker 2: Yes, I graduated with honors in criminal law.  And I guess what I found most fascinating, two courses that I found most fascinating in law school was Constitutional Law.  Because it was always a source of amazement to me that this little document that had been in existence since 1787, that it could still have such power over the lives of people.  And there was almost nothing that you can do or say that in one way or another is not addressed by that document, in one way or another.  And so, I was always fascinated with constitutional law, not to mention as was so many people, I had a wonderful... during the course of my law school years, there was an absolutely wonderful professor that I had who not only taught me about the Constitution and about the law, but also sort of set an example of social activism and, you know, talked about the need to make life better for all people, not just people who had opportunity and wealth and so forth, but to make life better for all people.  His name was Burton Wechsler, and he was a professor there at Valparaiso Law School for quite some time.  But he, he was absolutely amazing.  I had, I was in his class.  The first time I was in his class, he called on me.  And the worst thing to happen to a law student is to get called on frequently, because you have to read all of that, you have to prepare for class.  And he called on me, literally, every class.  You know, "Well, Mr. Hatcher, explain this case, and what does the Court say?"  And so, finally I had had enough of it.  Because no one else got called on, you know, that often.  And, and, so I asked him if I could come and talk to him in his office.  And, and I said to him, I said, "I know what you're doing.  Don't think that I don't understand what you're doing."  I said, "I'm the only black in the class, and, and, and you're trying to make a fool of me by calling on me every time to, you know, to explain this or explain that."  And you know, I said, "I just want you to know I'm not asking you not to do it.  I'm just telling you that I understand what you're doing.  And, you know, I understand that, you know, this is a racial issue, and that you're doing this."  And so, he sat there and he said, "Are you finished?"  And I said, "Yes."  I said, "I've said what I came here to say."  And then he started laughing.  And I said, "Well, you may think it's funny, but I don't think it's funny."  Because I was working full time while I was going to law school full time.  And he said, he said, "No," he said, "I'm not..."  He said, "Let me explain something.  You don't know me."  He said, "Let me tell you who I am."  And then he started, he said, "First of all," he says, "I live in Gary [Indiana]."  He says, "I am the attorney for the local chapter of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  He said, "I've participated in every demonstration, every march that they've had."  And he just went on talking about all these things, you know, that would be contrary to the notion that he might be racist or whatever.  And then I said... after he said... I said, "Well, why do you call on me all the time?  And why do you put me, you know, in the position where I've got to read... I mean I'm at work, and I have to, you know, try to prepare for your class while I'm at work."  He said, "Because the other students in that class have probably have never been in a classroom with a black before, that's the first thing."  And he said, "Secondly, I wanted them to know that every time you ask... I ask you a question, that you'd be able to give me the answer."  He says, "So, you'll have to excuse me, because I was using you to try to educate them."  And after that we became the very best of friends.  When I ran for mayor, when I ran for City Council, he was one of the persons that organized the whites.  There wasn't a large number, but he organized the whites that were willing at that time to support me and contributed to our campaign, of course, along with a number of other people.  And we are friends to this day.  We are really good friends to this very day.  He, he left Valparaiso and taught at American University, the law school in Washington, D.C.  And he lives, you know, with his wife in Washington, D.C.  But, but, when I first met him I was totally convinced that he was one of the biggest racists in the school, and that was saying something at that time, because there were lots of them.  But it turned out that he was just the opposite of what...
Story_ID: 78274
Speaker 1: Now, when you, when you complete law school [Valparaiso University Law School in Valparaiso, Indiana], what are your?  Your first job is--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at that point.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you come back, I mean--
Speaker 2: My sister had a hand in that, too, my oldest sister, Gladys.  Because she had a friend in Gary [Indiana] named Ben Wilson who was a lawyer, and she was a friend of his wife's, Fannie Wilson.  And then she had another friend in East Chicago [Indiana] named Henry Walker, who was a very prominent lawyer, you know, in the area.  And so, she called both of them and said, "My brother's about to graduate from law school, and he would like to get some experience, you know, working in a law firm.  Would you be willing to take him in?"  Unlike a lawyer and judge--a white lawyer and judge in Michigan City [Indiana] who my father [Carlton Hatcher] had talked to--he said, "My son's about to graduate."  "Oh, yes, Carl, yes, we'll take him in."  When I graduated, he said--because I would have been in Michigan City--but he said, "You know we have to move new files in, so we just don't have room for another desk," which I understood at the time, you know, what it was about.  My father was hurt.  But my sister called these two lawyers, and so I went to see each one of them.  And each one of them, after the interview, you know, said, "I'd like for you to come, you know, come into the office."  And so, it was a matter of having to just make a choice.  And both of them, as I said, was well known.  Ben Wilson was a member of the City Council in Gary, also.  And but I finally, I just had a better feeling for Henry Walker, and I decided that's where in would go.  And so, I became a lawyer in Henry Walker's office.  And it was a very good decision that I made.  Unfortunately, Ben Wilson literally a few months later wound up being embroiled in a huge scandal in the city, along with the mayor.  And a lot of people went to prison and all of that.  And if I had been in his office, I probably never would have escaped that stigma.  And so, it was just a fortuitous choice that I went with Henry Walker.  Henry Walker was also a person, though, that was well connected around the country.  He had friends in Washington [D.C.], and many times he would take me with him to Washington, and I would get to meet some people that I'd only read about--you know, very prominent people that I'd only read about.  And Patricia Harris, for example, who subsequently, you know, held a cabinet position [Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Jimmy Carter] and so forth.  Well, she was a good friend of Henry Walker, so I got to meet her and people like that.  So, it helped to open up, you know, certainly my own horizons and to see that there were things beyond Gary, beyond Michigan City, beyond East Chicago.  And so, that was a good choice.  And he was a smart man; he was a really smart lawyer, excellent lawyer.  And it was through him that I ultimately wound up becoming a deputy prosecutor in the, you know, in the criminal court and handling all kinds--everything from robberies to murders and so forth, and got a lot of great experience as a lawyer.  And then I also had the opportunity to do some other things.  For example, in 1964 there a call went out asking lawyers from all over the country to come to Mississippi, because they wanted to file class action lawsuits to desegregate public facilities in Mississippi.  Well, at that time, as you probably know, if you went to Mississippi you were taking your life in your hands.  And, but three of us decided that we were going to go to Mississippi.  We went and we stayed in Mississippi for about three weeks gathering evidence upon which to base these lawsuits.  And I probably would not have done that had I had the, not had this experience with Henry Walker.  And then when I decided that I wanted to run for the City Council in Gary [Indiana], I was able to move from Henry Walker's office to a law office in Gary.  Jackie Shropshire had a law office, and I wound up trying... I'm sorry, running for City Council in Gary as a result of that.
Story_ID: 78275
Speaker 1: I was asking about how you even came to run for [Gary, Indiana City] Council.
Speaker 2: Yes, to run for City Council.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, we, 'we' being a group of young men in Gary in the very early sixties [1960s]--we wanted to get involved.  Gary was a very machine organized town.  If you didn't have, if you were not in favor with the mayor or with other people downtown, then you couldn't even run for office.  I mean, it wasn't a matter of winning, you couldn't even run for office because bad things would happen.  People would get fired from their jobs or whatever.  And so, we thought this was wrong, particularly because the black community, which was very segregated, was getting--they didn't city services, they didn't get any of the things that normally you would expect from government.  And we thought this was wrong.  So, I'd just graduated from law school.  There were two or three others who had come from law school.  And there were some people who were teachers in the group.  So, we formed an organization.  And the name of the organization was "Muigwithania."  Muigwithania is a term that literally means, "We are together, we are united."  And it was the name of an underground newspaper that Jomo Kenyatta published when he was driving the British out of Kenya.  And so, we thought that was perfect for what we wanted to try to do.  And so, Muigwithania became our political base.  Initially, we would do things, we would raise money.  We'd have parties, we'd have dances, I used to call them.  And we would raise money, and we would use the money to buy food, boxes of food and other things.  And then we had an old school bus, and we would load it up.  We'd get our girlfriends and we'd all get on this old school bus.  And we would drive around, and then--because we'd gotten a list from the local welfare department.  And then we would drive around, and a couple of us would take a box of food and go to the door and knock on the door.  And when the people would come answer the door, just give them that.  We wouldn't say anything, we'd just leave.  And pretty soon people were saying, "Well, who are those guys, you know, who are coming around... you know, at night and passing, you know, passing out food and boxes of food and so forth?"  And so, we kind of got to be known, you know.  "Well, it was Muigwithania, it was these guys from Muigwithania."   And so Muigwithania then became--in 1963, we decided we would take our first step in politics.  We would run some of our members for public office.  And so, the agreement was that we would, that I was going to run for the City Council.  And there was support; there were other people that... at this point.  Because Muigwithania only had about fifteen members.  And so, other people came in, people who were politically active and knowledgeable, you know--Louis Drinker [ph.], C.C. Stephenson [ph.]--people, you know, who really knew the community and so forth, and that I'd had the good fortune of getting to know.  I mean, it was truly a good fortune, because they have turned out to be my best friends.
Story_ID: 78276
Speaker 1: And but, at any rate, I ran for the City Council [of Gary, Indiana], I ran for Councilman-at-large.  And of course, we were trying very hard to get enough people to vote for us [Muigwithania], because it was really a very controlled situation.  And here we were sort of like outsiders trying to get elected.  And, but the outcome of the election was a little surprising, because I received more votes than anyone had ever received in history for that office and, of course, won pretty overwhelmingly for City Council.  And as soon as I became a member of the Council, then the question became "What can you do?"  After all, most of the people in the Council are still part of a machine.  They, they have the majority.  But there were a couple of other whites that were elected to the Council at the same time I was.  And so the three of us became a kind of, we formed an alliance with each other.  And there were two blacks, there were two other blacks on the Council at the time also; it was a nine person Council.  And so, we knew that if we could get the two blacks to vote for one of us along with the three of us, we'd have enough votes to elect the president of the Council.  Now, there had absolutely never been a freshman, a first year person, who'd ever become president of the City Council.  That was something--you know, you serve and you wait your time until you have a chance.  But I ran for president of the City Council the very first year.  And somehow, I still...  I look back and don't know how it happened.  But somehow I was elected president of the City Council.  It hasn't happened since.  You know, a freshman hasn't won for president since, but I was elected.
Story_ID: 78277
Speaker 1: And so, we immediately started putting into place our issues, so to speak.  One was, people at that time could not live where they wanted to live in Gary.  They could only live, blacks could live in certain parts of the city.  And in fact, they weren't even permitted to be in some parts of... like on the beach out at Marquette Park, and on the beach.  And so, they... one of the first bills that I introduced was, it was called the Omnibus Open Occupancy Law.  And it basically said people could live wherever they wanted to live, wherever they could afford to live.  I mean, that's where they could live.  So, it was a very controversial piece of legislation.  And every meeting the Council chambers was jammed, you know, with people, mostly white, almost all white, opposing, opposed to this bill.  And we kept working on it, and we finally got to the point where we had four votes.  We had these two freshman Councilmen with me that were elected with me.  And then we have one of the blacks--one of the blacks said that they would vote.  The other was very reluctant, very reluctant to do so.  And so, at any rate we battled and battled and battled.  And ultimately the bill was defeated, and I introduced it again.  It was defeated again.  I introduced... and I told my colleagues on the Council, I said, "You know, as many times as you vote it down, I'm going to bring it back."  And finally the last time the, the black changed his mind, the one that was pretty close to the mayor.  You know, the mayor was kind of controlling him.  But he changed his mind and he voted for it, and it passed.  And so, we had a bill.  The mayor did not dare veto that bill, because, you know, there was too much out in the community that said that they wanted that.  And so, so, it was finally possible in Gary for people to live wherever they could afford to live.  We also were reform minded, because there was a lot of corruption at that time.  If you wanted to get a re-zoning, a piece of property re-zoned, you'd have to go and talk to certain members of the Council.  And I don't mean just talk to them.  You had to pass some dollars to them.  And so, we ran on a reform platform, you know, that honesty--we're not going to have any more of this selling... you know of...  And that was a tough operation.  But we were able to sort of change the climate in the Council, and were able to initiate a number of reforms that gave people a more honest government than they frankly had been used to having.  So that, you know, I considered that a great accomplishment of my time on the Council.  And then we finally had something called the Omnibus Civil Rights Law.  Because, believe it or not, even after the housing open occupancy law passed, blacks still couldn't go to this one hotel in town; they couldn't be served.  In fact, that hotel was called Gary Hotel at the time--

Speaker 1: They apparently could see that Harold Washington was going to win, that he was going to become mayor [of Chicago, Illinois in 1983].  And so, they said "Well, you know, we'd like to avoid in the Chicago community a lot of the problems, you know, that you ran into in Gary [Illinois] and, you know, people saying, well I'm going to move out of the city because we have a black mayor now--what, you know, what kinds of things we can do."  And I spent about two hours out there, you know, talking... talking with him about that.  Now, I have no idea whether they ever talked to Harold Washington or whether he had any notion, you know, that they were, they were...  But they, they went over that.  I tried to tell them a lot of things.  Like, I talked about the City Council.  I said "one of the problems that always develops is that when you have basically an all-white Council, with a few exceptions, they resent very much a black mayor.  And so, they're going to do a lot of things to try to, you know, block the things that he wants to do."  And I said, "That's going to happen unless the leadership in the community, unless the church and other leaders step up and say, 'No, this is wrong, and we have to cooperate.'"  And so, I talked about things like that.  Well, sure enough, as you know, the first thing Harold Washington ran into was Council Wars, you know, [Edward] Vrdolyak and those guys.  So, so, I have no idea what, as I said, prompted them to have that meeting.  But it was a chance at least to talk about some of the things that I saw as mistakes that happened in Gary, and to try to avoid those things in Chicago.
Story_ID: 78256
Speaker 1: Now, I have... I have to ask a question, though.  This thing about you, you know, winning [being elected mayor of Gary, Indiana], which you almost came to as a fluke.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But I can't... was it really a fluke, or was it strategy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think there are sort of two things that were probably key.  And it was a different time, so of course different things apply today that may not have applied then.  But first of all, one of the things was very clear to me.  We had this machine that literally had control of everything.  And until there was a State Senator, a white State Senator from Gary named Konrady, and he wanted to run for mayor.  And this machine kind of basically said, "No, it's not your turn."  And, and they supported another candidate and sort of cast him aside.  He was making a speech not very long after that and... a public speech, and he died of a heart attack.  He had a sudden heart attack and he died.  He had a brother who was a businessman in the community there... a very large oil and coal and whatever firm.  And his brother absolutely believes that it was because of the way this, these machine folks, treated his brother that he had this heart attack--that they placed, you know, so much stress on him.  And so he, he, he blamed them for that.  And so, when the election in 1967 came up, you had the incumbent who was A. Martin Katz, and who was more or less at least identified with the machine, although he was a very decent man and, you know, a good person.  But he, he had been the city court judge, and he also became mayor with the support of this machine.  And, and you had him running and then you have Bernard Konrady, the brother who feels that they have wronged his brother.  And so, he's in the race.  So, you've got two very well known, you know, high name recognition whites running.  And then I kind of eased into the race.  And so, certainly a lot of the... you know, astute politicians kind of saw what could happen.  And so, they went to Bernard Konrady and did every... they offered him money, they did everything they possibly could to try to get him to get out of the race.  But as I said, he, in his heart he felt that they had killed his brother.  And so he stayed, he stayed in the race.  When the election--this was the primary election.  And in Gary, if you win the primary, you can almost go home and go to sleep ordinarily, because it's such an overwhelming Democratic town that you're going to win in the fall almost automatically.  So, we have these two whites and this one black.  Now, there were two or three other blacks that ran, but they were not at all well known, and they weren't even serious candidates, you know.  And in fact some people say there were put in to try to pull votes from me.  But I got most of the black community's vote.  And at that time, the black registered voters in the city of Gary were about thirty-nine percent.  They were about thirty-nine percent of the population.  And, and, I got most of that vote, although Mayor Katz also got some of it, but I got most of it.  I only got about eight percent of the white vote, and that was primarily because of people like [Burton] Burt Wechsler and others who were really trying to help out.  And the result was that I wound up winning the primary just by a very small margin, because these... Konrady and Katz had split the white vote almost right down the middle.  The white vote was larger, but they had split it right down the middle.  And so, I wound up coming through the middle and winning the election, much to the shock...  No one paid too much attention to me in that race, because there had never been a black mayor before.  They had no idea that, you know, anybody could win, could actually win.
Story_ID: 78257
Speaker 1: We had gone up-- two years before that; a group of us that had heard about this black running for mayor in Cleveland [Ohio].  And we had gotten in a car, loaded up two cars and drove up to Cleveland.  Didn't know Carl Stokes, didn't have no idea, we just wanted to go up and try to help out.  And so we drove to Cleveland and, you know, members of Muigwithania, and we went around and found the headquarters and got some literature and passed out literature to try to help Carl Stokes.  Carl Stokes lost, you know, that first time he ran [1965].  But he came back in 1967 and ran again at the same time I ran.
Story_ID: 78258
Speaker 1: And so, you know, we had some idea.  But other people, you know, that was like a pipe dream.  People would laugh, you know, and say, "You're running for mayor?" you know.  But I won the primary [in 1967], much to the shock and surprise of everyone.  And we had very little money and we spent it all, you know, on that primary election, assuming at that point that what had happened before would happen again--what had always happened in the Democratic Party.  Once the Democratic primary was over, the party picked up the cost of the fall campaign.  You didn't have to pay that.  The first time that I knew that something was wrong was when the County Chairman, a man named John Krupa, called me and said he wanted to meet with me at some restaurant.  And when I met with him, he says--I thought he wanted to meet with me to tell me the party was now going to, you know, provide the resources for the fall campaign.  He said, "Well, I just thought I ought to tell you how things are done around here."  And I said, "What's that?"  He said, "Well, we will name the Chief of Police, we will name the City Controller, and we will name the Corporation Counsel."  He said, "Those three offices historically the party always names those.  We decide who those people are going to be."  And I said, "You're joking, right?  I mean, you're not, you're not serious about this?"  He said, "No, that's the way it is."  I said, "Well, let me tell you."  I said, "That's why I ran for mayor, so that I could name these people, so that I could select these people."  And so, I said "I'm not about to allow someone else to decide that."  He said, "You're making a mistake."  And he, he used the allegory, he says, "It's like a three-legged stool that we have here in Lake County."  He says, "Hammond is one leg, East Chicago is another leg, and Gary is the other leg."  And he said, "You know, that's the way it's always been and that's the way it's always going to be."  I said, "Well, it's not going to be that way in Gary this time."   I said, "Because I'm going to name my own staff and whatever."  And so, he said, "Well, okay, you sure you won't change?"  I said, "No, that's the way it is."  Imagine my surprise when I read his version of what had happened.  He announced, he said, "I am not going to be able as Democratic County Chairman to support Richard Hatcher in the fall for mayor because he is not a red, white and blue American."  So, a reporter says, "What do you mean he's not a red, white and blue...?"  "I will not support him until he denounces publicly Jane Fonda...  What's...?
Speaker 2: Rap Brown?
Speaker 1: Rap Brown, H. Rap Brown, Stokely Carmichael, all these people.  I mean, he had a whole list of people.  And at the time, I didn't know where he got the list.  As it turned out, there had been a number of people who had signed an ad that appeared that was published in the London Times against the war, against the Vietnam War; they had signed this ad.  That's where he got the list, out of the newspaper.  And so he said, unless I was willing to denounce every one of those persons on there... I think [HM] Harry Belafonte's name was on the list and, you know, just... it was ridiculous.  And so, you know, the reporters came to me and they said, "Well, the County Chairman said he's not going to support you unless, you know, you do that.  Are you going to do that?"  I said, "No way."  I said, "First of all..."  I said, "Most of those persons on that list, I have never met them, I don't know them; I have had no opportunity to talk with them about anything."  I said, "But beyond that," I said "I'm not denouncing people, you know, because they take a public stand."  I said, "That's what I hope to do, you know, when I become mayor."
Story_ID: 78259
Speaker 1: And so John Krupa, he went on the talk shows, he went on radio, he was on Chicago [Illinois] television talking about this person who was--he didn't quite come out and call me a Communist, but he came very close to that.  And one of the bases that he used--there had been an American flyer that had been shot down, I think in Vietnam.  And "The Call," you know, "Muhammad Speaks," the newspaper that was published over here, they had written a story about this man being shot down and captured, you know, because he was flying a plane and dropping bombs, you know, on the villages and so forth.  And he was shot down and he was captured.  And so, they-- from time to time, you know, I was interviewed by reporters from The Call and from Muhammad Speaks.  And, and, they asked me, you know, they said, "Well, do you think it's fair for someone who is dropping bombs on you and killing your children, your wives and all of that, and then he's captured.  Do you think it would be fair to punish that person for what they have done, you know, for what they have done?"  And I said, "It sounds fair to me."  (Laughter).  You know, I mean, I said, "It sounds fair to me."  And so, of course, John Krupa immediately, when that story came, out he immediately jumped and said, "There's your proof.  I told you that he was not a red, white, and blue American.  He's advocating that our flyers be killed."  Well, I had always been against the Vietnam War.  I had always, you know, said I thought that was an unjust war, I thought we had no business fighting that war.  So, I was kind of surprised that it became like a big issue and, and, you know, really questioned my patriotism and so forth.  But I refused to change my position.  I just told him I wasn't going to change my position.  And they went and talked with people at Muhammad Speaks and, you know, to... and these are some of the Chicago papers--and so, "Did he really say that?"  And I don't remember exactly what they said, but the way they put it, they said, "Well, he wasn't really saying that American flyers, you know, should be killed and so forth."  But I did not, I mean I never told... I mean I got asked that a hundred times.  I never told anyone anything different.  I never, you know, denied it.  Because I mean I was asked to express my opinion, and I did.  That was, that was... that was my opinion.  I am sure that if someone dropped bombs on my house and killed my children and somehow I captured them, I would do something to them.  I mean, I'm sure of that.  I'm absolutely sure of that.  And that has... it's like it has nothing to do with... what your country against the other country, or whatever, you know.  So, so, from that point of view... from that point of view I was just painted with this brush.  "Oh, he won't denounce Rap Brown.  He won't denounce Stokely Carmichael.  Marlon Brando, he won't denounce Marlon Brando."  "Marlon Brando?"  You know, he's an actor, you know.  (Laughter).  And, and so Krupa, though, was very clever.  He belonged to a lot of American Legion organizations and VFW's [Veterans of Foreign Wars] and so forth.  He was very active with those groups.  So, he really was able to use that effectively against me.  And he was able to rationalize and justify--although you can't imagine how it could be rationalized--the Democratic Party not supporting the Democratic candidate for Mayor in Gary, but supporting the Republican candidate for Mayor [Joseph Radigan].  But that's what they did.  They announced that they were going to support...  So, it looked pretty tough for us.
Story_ID: 78260
Speaker 1: Because we had spent all of our money and we didn't have money for the fall campaign [for Mayor of the City of Gary, Indiana].  Then a kind of miracle... I mean that's the only way I can describe how it happened.  Two young white guys from Chicago [Illinois] walked into our headquarters one evening and it was like we were commiserating, you know, "What are we going to do?  You know, we're really in this fix."  We never anticipated we were going to have a battle in the fall.  And they said, "We have a plan.  We know how you can win the election.  We've read about, you know, what's going on, and we know how you can win the election."  I said, "Really, tell us.  What is the plan?"  He said, "We can't tell you, we can't tell you.  But if you can raise..." I think ten thousand dollars, I think that was...  "If you can raise ten thousand dollars, then we will tell you what the plan is and tell you how it works."  I said, yeah, this is a scam.  I mean, this is a scam.  These guys have heard about what was going on.  And so, so I said, "Well, you know, I appreciate your coming.  But no thank you, we're not giving you ten thousand dollars, you know, and then you leave."  They said, "No, no, we're legitimate."  They said, "We work... they named a couple of advertising firms here in Chicago that they worked for."  And they said, "We're, you know, we're really legitimate."  And they said, "Okay, we'll tell you what the plan is; we'll tell you what the plan is."  So, they told us what the plan was.  At that point, they might as well have been saying ten million dollars, because ten thousand dollars was so far beyond our reach at that time that it wasn't funny.  But we were in this meeting, and there was a young lady there that I'd gone to college with.  I was at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], and she was at Indiana University.  And she was married to a doctor.  And she was one of our campaign volunteers.  And [Burton] Burt Wechsler and some of these other people were in this meeting.  And we were all talking, you know, how could we raise this money?  We had no idea.  And so, she spoke up.  And, and, she said, "My husband will give a thousand dollars."  And we said, "Shirley, wait a minute.  You'd better go talk to Doc, you know, before you commit him."  And she said, "No, he will give you, he will give a thousand dollars."  Well, when she said that, that sort of got other people saying... you know, somebody said, "Well, I can give five hundred, I'll give five hundred."  And we kept going, and we actually had pledges up to nine thousand dollars... nine thousand dollars.  So, that was as much as we could go, though, we couldn't go beyond.  We took that and said to these guys, "Okay, you know, let's, let's do this."  And this was their plan.  It was just really very simple.  They were going to buy--and this shows you the time this was.  They were going to buy a full-page ad in the New York Times, in the Chicago Tribune, and the Los Angeles Times, and the Gary Post-Tribune, all for ten thousand dollars.  Now, you know, ten thousand dollars today couldn't get you a paragraph probably.  But that's what it would get you at that time.  And so, so we decided that we couldn't do the Los Angeles Times because, as I said, we only got to nine thousand dollars, and it wasn't going to be enough.  So, so, we did the full-page in the New York Times, did the full-page ad in the Chicago Tribune, and a full-page ad in the Post-Tribune.  At that point, it was the most amazing thing in the world.  People started sending money from all over the country.  And they would send five dollars, they would send... the one I remember most, a lady who lived in West Virginia, a white lady that lived in West Virginia.  She wrote on this, scribbled on this note, she said, "I'm a white lady who lives in West Virginia.  I'm enclosing..."  She enclosed two quarters wrapped in there.  She said, "I feel you need this more than I need it."  I mean, that's how powerful those ads were.
Story_ID: 78261
Speaker 1: They were, they were probably some of the most powerful political ads ever done.  And essentially their ads were based on the theme, "For God's sake, let's get ourselves together."  And, and, that had a kind of double meaning.  Because in the black community, of course, "get yourself together" means, you know, get... do what you need to do, get right.  But in the white community, it meant the racists getting themselves... that's what, that's how they read it.  And so, so, people just sent money from all over the country.  I got a telephone call, "Would you like to come to New York [New York City, New York]?"  There was a program at that time called "The New Yorkers," a television program.  "Would you like to come?  We will fly you to New York, and you can make an appeal on the air and ask people to send you money."  And so, I went to New York, and I was on this show, on this program.  And when I came out of the studio, I was coming out of the studio, and I heard someone around the corner, you know, whispering my name.  You know, "come here; come here."  And I looked around, and there was this guy, this young black man was standing there.  And he says, "I'm a member of Senator Robert Kennedy's staff.  And he asked me to come down here and to talk to you, because he wants to meet you, and he wants to do something to help you."  And so, interestingly enough, that young man turned out to be [HM] Earl Graves, who now owns Black Enterprise and all of that, that's right.  And so, so, sure enough he took me up to this apartment where Senator Kennedy was and introduced me.  And so, Bobby Kennedy said basically... he said, "Well, I'd like to have you come back to New York.  I have a friend, you know, on Park Avenue..." or whatever it was.  He said, "I have a friend, and she will, you know, host a fundraiser for you if you can come back."  And so, I said, "Well, of course, you know, I'll come back."  And so, he got [HM] Ossie Davis to come to this fundraiser and be the person who made the pitch, you know, for the money.  And you know Ossie, I mean he just... there's nobody that could resist, you know, what he had to say.  And so, so, in that one thing, and this was a very big... we raised fifteen thousand dollars, you know, in this...  It was just a little reception where they invited these people... fifteen thousand dollars.  I get back home and I get another call.  And it's the Vice President of the United States, its Hubert Humphrey.  He says, "I'd like for you to come to Washington [D.C.], and we want to have a fundraiser for you."  And so, I said, you know, "Thank you very much."  Well, I'll bet it wasn't ten minutes after I hung up the phone, Ted Kennedy was calling me saying he wanted to hold a fundraiser for me in Washington, D.C.  And it just went like that.  It just... we wound up, on the basis of those ads, we wound up raising probably pretty close to half a million dollars--people just sending money, you know, from around the country.  So, we at least had one problem solved.  We had the money, you know, to run the campaign.  And these two guys, I don't know where they are today, but they... you know, it was just incredible that they wandered into that headquarters that day and said, "We've got a plan."
Speaker 2: Do you remember their names?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  One's name was Jack, Jack Davin, or Devon.  And I don't recall the other's name.  I have sort of a framed copy of the ads themselves, a blowup of the ads themselves.  And I go back sometimes and read them.  And, and, now--I mean at the time, I didn't understand it at all.  But I go back now and read them.  And I see why at that particular time what they have to say in those ads was so gripping to people, and caused people to, you know, feel the way they felt.  But as I said, the money came.
Story_ID: 78262
Speaker 1: The other thing they did, which was very good--but I mean, I knew nothing about advertising at the time.  So, I assume this is what all advertisers do.  But, by virtue... what they wanted to do was announce ahead of time that these ads were coming, you know, in the New York Times and so forth.  And so they were able to place little blurbs, like, in Time Magazine.  Time Magazine had a little like "News of the Week" or something like that.  And Time Magazine had a little blurb that said, you know, "There's a Negro running for Mayor in East Chi- Gary [Indiana], and there's going to be an ad in the New York Times about this campaign."  And I don't know how they did that, but they were able to get little things in, that were not like advertising, but like news--you know, little news inserts.  But at any rate, by the time the ads came out, it was almost as if the country was waiting for them, you know, waiting for them to come out.  Well, we got the money, and were able then to mount, you know, a really serious campaign.  But all the polls were showing that this was going to be a very close race.  So, and, you know, it could go either way.  And then the bomb dropped.  I would say maybe two weeks, a little more than two weeks before the election, there was a lady...  At that time, most of the precinct organization in Gary was white.  And most of them were absolutely opposed to me.  And, and, there was a white woman out in the Glen Park section of the city, which was considered really the most racist section of the city at the time.  And she was a committeeman out there.  And the way she told it later, she said she was...  She was Catholic and she went to church.  And she said the priest in his sermon says that... you know, the church was crowded.  But his sermon, it was almost as if he was speaking directly to her, as if she was the only person in the church.  And based upon that, she then went to, went to...  There were out-of-town reporters... reporters from Look Magazine, and a lot of other national publications that existed at that time that came to town to cover this election.  Because by this time, after the ads and all that, I mean, I don't know if there was anyone in America that was not aware that, you know, there was a black running for mayor in Gary.  And she called... there was a reporter and a photographer from Look Magazine.  And she called them one night.  And she said, "I have some important information.  I'd like to meet with you."  And so, she met with them someplace out wherever.  And she told them this incredible story... that this John Krupa and other officials in the Democratic Party had gone around the city.  And like if there was a building, an apartment building, they would count the number of windows in an apartment building, and they would write down a non-existence voter name for every one of those.  If there were twenty-five apartment windows, they would write down twenty-five names.  Well, he could do that, because in addition to being County Democratic Chairman, he was also the County Clerk.  And under Indiana law, it's the County Clerk who runs the election, has control over the election machinery.  So he was able to just load up the rolls with phony... thousands of phony names, people that did not exist.  And basically, the plan was that they would recruit people to go around to polling place to polling place with the list of names, and these people would vote those names.  They would vote them, and obviously they weren't going to vote for me, they were going to vote...  So, what would have happened is that by ten o'clock that morning of the election--
Story_ID: 78155
Speaker 1: But I certainly did not win.  I lost by a very large margin--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in Michigan City [Indiana], and I couldn't understand it.  Because as I had gone around before the election, everyone said, "I'm going to vote for you, I'm going to support you."  White and black alike... "I'm going to vote for you."  I couldn't understand it, that election night [1958], I wound up not first, not second, but third.  I mean, I didn't even come in, you know, I wasn't the runner-up even.  And so, but that was a lesson for me, too.  I mean I learned something from that.
Speaker 2: But for clarification, for the record, we're talking about your running for Justice of the Peace.
Speaker 1: Justice of the Peace, yes.
Speaker 2: But I want to go back to the story.
Story_ID: 78156
Speaker 1: So, here is Krupa--
Speaker 2: John Krupa.
Speaker 1: Krupa, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He's, so this woman is telling a story about how--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, this whole, this whole scheme.
Speaker 2: Yes.  She meets with these two reporters and tells them the whole story, and how we won't even know what hit us.  I mean it'll just be over, literally, before it begins.  And so, the two reporters then, you know, they felt they had a big scoop, a big story that would be a national story.  But they, they were divided in terms of should we let the Hatcher people know about this?  Or should we wait and let it happen and then write this big story after the election of how we knew, you know, how this happened, how this turned out?  And they, they, sincerely, they were both white.  They, they, sincerely were reluctant to come and tell us about it.  But finally, I think, you know, something prevailed, and they did call one of the people that was working in my campaign and told him what was going on, and what was about to happen.  So, we then immediately sprang into action--Jackie Shropshire and what's his name?  A very famous lawyer here in Chicago [Illinois], who was head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: Ming?
Speaker 2: Ming, [William Robert] Bob Ming [Jr.].
Speaker 1: Ming, Bob Ming.
Speaker 2: Bob Ming.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Bob Ming and his partner, Attorney [Walter] Black, the two of them, my law partner called them.  And so, they came over and they agreed to take this case.  And they immediately filed an emergency petition in the Federal District Court.  And the Federal District Court convened a panel of federal judges to hear this thing.  And, and, it turned out that the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] had been investigating vote fraud in Lake County, and in fact had determined before we knew anything, that there were thousands of names on the voting rolls of non-existent or dead people.  And they apparently were not going to do anything.  They were not going to tell us about it or do anything about it.  And, and, but when we went to court--and it's the first time--the 1964 Civil Rights Act had never before been applied in the North.  It had always been applied to southern states.  This was the first, and to the best of my knowledge, the only time that that law has ever been applied, you know, in a northern state.  And then [HM] Roger Wilkins, who was then an assistant in the Justice Department, Roger Wilkins called.  And he said, "I'm going to have the Justice Department intervene, be an intervener in this case, you know, as one of the plaintiffs."  And so, we have the Justice Department, we had Bob Ming who was a fantastic lawyer, and his partner--I can't think of his first name, but [Walter] Black.  And they, they, they were all in there, and they all went to court.  And here's this federal panel hearing evidence of our contention that there was a scheme to steal the election.

Speaker 1: And, and, when they [HM Roger Wilkins, Bob Ming, and Walter Black] finished presenting evidence, the court voted unanimously, first of all, to issue an injunction against any effort, you know, to do this.  Secondly, the court ordered that all federal marshals in this region be brought into Gary [Indiana] on Election Day to monitor, you know, the election and make sure that nothing, you know, was done improper.  And they ordered that these phony names--and thousands of them were submitted to the court--be stripped, you know, be thrown out.  Well, by that time, we were so paranoid that we didn't even think that was enough.  We didn't think it was enough to have federal marshals and everybody else.  So, we decided on our own that--as I said, we didn't have many white supporters, but we had a few.  And so, what we did was we got them to put on a trench coat and a hat.  And their instructions were to, "You drive around from polling place to polling place, and jump out of the car, and whip out a notepad and act like you're taking notes.  And then you don't say anything to anybody.  Just do that and then leave, you know, and go to the next polling place."  Well, very early on Election Day the word just spread like wildfire, "Don't do anything.  The FBI is here, the FBI is here.  They're coming to the polling places.  So don't, you know, don't do anything."  With all of that--and then the governor [Roger D. Branigin] announced the day before that he was calling out the National Guard, because they were afraid that if I lost there was going to be riots in Gary.  And so, he was calling out the National Guard, and he was going to have the National Guard in the city with tanks and whatever.  And they did, they came into the city.  And it was so amazing, because we knew that all that was going to do was to frighten people, and probably would cause a lot of black people especially to stay home and not come out and vote.  And we felt that's why he was doing it; that's why the governor was ordering, you know, the National Guard out.  Because we didn't... so we didn't know of anybody that was going to riot or anything like that. But he had them all there.  With all of that that happened, when the election was over, I had won the election by... literally, it was almost eight-tenths of a point.  It was, that's how close it was.  I won by eight-tenths of a point.  And, you know, there was some talk for a while about, "Well, we want a re-count," and all of that.  But of course, the problem with the re-count was that there were probably other things that they had done that we didn't know about, and all of that would come out.  So, so, they finally... I think it was the next day around noon before my opponent who was a gentleman named [Joseph] Radigan, a businessman in Gary, called me and conceded, conceded the election.  But my actual election had been certified the night before at about 12:01 a.m.  And I mention that because Carl Stokes and I always have this thing about, "Well, I was first."  "No, I was first, I was the first one elected."  And so, I always... I mean, jokingly.  And I, I told Carl once, I said "Carl, now, let's be factual."  I said, "My election was certified at 12:01 a.m. in the morning.  Yours was not certified until 6:30 the next morning."  I said, "Even though we both ran and were elected the same day, basically, mine was certified before you.  So, that makes me first."  He said, "Well, wait a minute."  He said, he said, "In Cleveland [Ohio], we take office two weeks after the election."  He said, "So, I became Mayor two weeks after election.  You didn't become Mayor until January 1st [1968], you know, the following January 1st.  So, that makes me first."  I said, "Okay, Carl."  (Laughter).  I said, "You know, you..."  We joked about that, we joked about that a lot.  But essentially we were elected the same night, elected the same night.
Speaker 2: Which is pretty amazing. First (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yes, there's no question about it.  And, you know, I thought about that since.
Story_ID: 78158
Speaker 1: If you, if you remember, [HM] Mervyn Dymally of California and [HM] George Brown of Colorado, they were elected lieutenant governors the same night in the same election [1967].  So, I guess we come in two's.  And you know, they became the first black lieutenant governors, you know, in the country.  But yes, we [Hatcher and Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes] were both elected the same night.  And you know, we were very good friends.  I mean we worked together in the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Although Carl was a very... Carl was very debonair and, you know, very stylish person.  So, between he and John Lindsay, who was the mayor of New York City at the time--if you were in a room, a crowded room--and Carl and John Lindsay were in the room, all the TV and reporters, everybody went to them--they took pictures of them.  Now, you just happened to be there, but they were the focus of attention.  But Carl did really a great job.  And Cleveland [Ohio] was a tough proposition for him, you know, at that time.  And I remember asking him when he announced that he was not going to run for another term.  And, and, I called him, and I said, "Carl, why aren't you going to run again?  You know, you have to run."  He says, "Dick, I've just gotten to the point where I hate to get up in the morning and go down to that office.  Because it's that frustrating, you know, that many problems."  He kept having trouble trying to name a chief of police that he could count on.  He had to fire I think two or three of them.  He was really having a hard time with that.  And, and, there were other problems that...  I remember one time he wanted to build some low-income housing in what was essentially a middle-class black neighborhood.  He got absolutely the riot act read to him, you know, by the blacks who did not want low-income housing in their neighborhood.  So he, you know, it was a tough proposition.  But as I said, Carl...  I had it when I was at Harvard [University in Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I asked him to come up and speak at a symposium.  And he came up, and we had a lot of fun talking about those things, you know, that had happened.  But again, at the time they weren't funny at all.  I mean they were not, they were not funny at all.
Story_ID: 78159
Speaker 1: Were there similarities between your races and the, you know, challenges?  I mean, you know, Cleveland [Ohio] is larger than Gary [Indiana].  But--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was it also, you know, was it still the machine there versus that?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was he... you know, I mean, what similarities and what differences?
Speaker 2: From what [Cleveland Mayor] Carl [Stokes] told me--I mean our machine was an ethnic machine, it was an ethnic machine.  It was people, you know, who had come to this country.  And in many cases they were first-generation, and in some cases second.  But they were, they were working people.  Many of the Irish, and the Pols [Polish], and the Italians, and other ethnic groups who came to this country around, beginning around the 1830's and during that period, were treated very badly, you know, by the people that were already here.  They were discriminated against.  You know, they couldn't get certain jobs, they couldn't live in certain places.  They were really discriminated against.  But where they were able to sort of break out, around the turn of the century, was that in these cities... they were sort of drawn to these cities because that was the only place they could sort of be treated, you know--and they weren't treated well there.  But they began to, their numbers began to accumulate in these cities.  And so, eventually they used that--you know, the very fact that they were jammed into certain neighborhoods and all that--to begin voting as a bloc, to begin... you know.  And they began to take over these cities and win, you know, election as mayor and so forth.  That was the kind of mix that existed in Gary.  It was a lot of Macedonians, it was Pols, it was Greeks; it was... you know.  And they, they, they were... they were people who were not wealthy--you know, not the elite in any sense.  But they came together and they built a foundation for themselves, you know, in the cities like Gary.  Then, what happened was the steel mills came, and the steel mills needed workers.  And so blacks came from the South, and people came from Puerto Rico, and people came from Mexico to Gary, because those were great paying jobs.  I mean those jobs really paid well.  And so, you began to see the black community expanding and growing in Gary.  So, so, that was the kind of mix that we were faced with in Gary.  Now, if I am... you know, I just take what [Cleveland Mayor] Carl [Stokes] said, because I wasn't in Cleveland [Ohio]... I visited Cleveland.  But he said that in Cleveland, it was a whole different situation.  He said that he found that most of his opposition came from sort of a kind of upper-middle class sort of English background group of people, you know, the Tafts and, you know, those families.  He said that was his tough, you know, really tough opposition.  And so, so, that was a little different, you know, from the situation in Gary, although as I said, Cleveland is much larger than the city of Gary.  But ours was more of a sort of a working person's population.  Almost everyone worked at U.S. Steel--blacks, Greeks, almost everybody worked at U.S. Steel or one of the other steel mills.  So, so, it was, in that sense it was a little different.  But, you know, the basic proposition was the same--the idea of a black being mayor, being captain of the ship, being the chief executive.  That was just a foreign notion... that was a foreign notion, pardon me, in 1967, 1968.  It was like something went wrong.  You know, "What went wrong here, that something like this could happen."
Story_ID: 78160
Speaker 1: Do you remember how you felt the night of your election [November 7, 1967]?  You know, when you--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, do I...?
Speaker 1: Do you remember how you felt the night of the election when you realized you had--
Speaker 2: Well, I can tell you how I felt about maybe a week before the election.  I had worked so hard; I'd been campaigning for a year.  And, and, everyone had worked so hard.  And, and, I just felt that I was about to die, because I was so tired by going to so many meetings and all of this controversy, and all of that.  And, and, and, all that I wanted was to get it over.  I didn't care whether I won, I didn't care whether I lost.  I just wanted to get it over, because I just felt totally exhausted and totally worn out.  Now, the night of the election it was, it was just exhilaration.  It was exhilaration.  People came to our headquarters, which was on Broadway.  And very early in the evening, even before the returns were in, the place began to fill up.  We had a big storefront, and the place began to fill up.  And then people spilled out onto the streets.  And then pretty soon, they had to block off the two blocks of Broadway and Main Street because the street was just totally jammed, you know, with people.  And people were literally dancing in the streets.  I mean, that was a sight that I never expected to see, and never expect to see again in life.  But it was such a happy, joyous... you know, we have overcome, we have done this.  And, and, and, that really made me... I mean all of the weariness and the tired... and all of that just went.  I mean I just felt exhilaration that this could happen, you know, that...  And it wasn't so much that it could happen to me, but that it could happen to us--that we would be able to actually win after all, you know, that we'd gone through over the past year.  So, I just felt fantastic.  In fact I don't think I got to bed until like four or five o'clock the next morning.  And it was, it was a night that I'll always remember and always, you know, just have great appreciation for.
Story_ID: 78161
Speaker 1: Now, then the issue is you becoming a symbol for black America in many ways, and being able to handle that against actually, you know, putting a team in place and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, running a city.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, how did those, how did you work those things out?  Or what... because both would pull in those--
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you.  First of all, it's an interesting thing, that I never had any doubt that I could run a city.  I never had any doubt about that.  And don't ask me why, because I'd never run a city before.  But I know... I saw people who had been mayor of the city, and to say the least, I was not overwhelmed, you know, by their ability or whatever.  And so, I never had any doubt that I could run the city.  But I got... it was an amazing thing.  That was a different time than today.  Because at that time it was sort as if the entire country shared in what had happened in Gary [Indiana], and what had happened in Cleveland [Ohio].  And so, I immediately... I mean right... literally the first day that I was in office, probably before, began to get calls from people in Washington [D.C] and other places--you know, basically saying, "Look, we know  how to do this.  And we'd be willing to come and say spend a year in Gary working for you to help you, you know, get this in place."  So, we had access to some of the most skilled and able people in the country.  And, and, and, they came.  You know, we had people who helped put together a program of law enforcement for us.  We had people who put together housing programs for us.  We had people who put together work programs for us.  We created three super positions, and were able to fill those positions with people who had extensive experience in the federal government.  Because at that time, interestingly enough, we really had more... as a people we had more experience in the federal government than we did in local government.  And so, these people would come.  Like, there was an assistant, this guy was an Assistant Secretary of Labor.  And he just asked his superiors, "I'd like to take a year off and work in Gary."  And so, he came, he came to Gary.  And we had people from the Justice Department who took off and came and worked and helped us to put together a governing structure that was I thought as good as any in the country, as any in the country.  And then we had this terrific enthusiasm and willingness to work, on the part of local people... people, you know, in Gary who'd never been given a chance before.  I mean you could go to City Hall, and you might see one or two blacks working down there.  And usually, one of them was a janitor or something like that.  But here for the first time they had a chance to actually run the government, run the city.  And so, it was an opportunity that people welcomed.  And what you found was that they were like diamonds, you know, in the rough.  You found that there were people who no one thought could do certain kinds of things.  But they did, you know, and they did them exceedingly well.  And it was, it was a tremendous, tremendous growing experience, you know, to be able to do that.  We knew that locally that folks who had run the government and had all this experience in local government, but were also white, we knew they weren't going to help.  We understood that very well.  But we were fortunate that we had all this help around the country.  We had people who felt they had a stake in our succeeding.  And so they, you know, they came and they made, in many instances, made real sacrifices in order to do that.
Story_ID: 78162
Speaker 1: Do you think that you, on hindsight, would have anticipated the strong reaction of the whites, in the wave of white flight, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --being taken, and creating a whole other city and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  No, I must tell you that I did not anticipate the depth of the feeling of whites.  You know, since that time I've gotten a little better understanding of it.  And, and, I sort of liken it to someone coming to your house and then saying, "Well, now, I'm going to take over.  I'm going to take over, I'm going to run the house."  And if you have always felt that was your house, I mean, you feel, "I worked for this house, this is my house."  And then here's this group of people who've never been a part of that saying, "I'm going to take over," then you can at least begin to understand, not appreciate, but understand the kind of reaction that we got.  And, and, essentially what it came down to was that the very idea of being governed by a black is simply unacceptable.  "I can't stand that, I just can't bear that.  I can't bear that, and so I'm leaving.  I'm going to move out, move out to the suburbs even though there's only cornfields out there.  I'll move out into the cornfields, because I just cannot accept the idea of a black, you know, in effect having hegemony over me.  I, I, can't..."  And that's what many, many, many other people felt.  And we did... it's always interesting, because the victim always get accused.  I was accused of driving white people out of Gary [Indiana].  I mean, I used to joke with people.  I said, "You know, I'm like a dusty John Wayne.  I've got this whip, and I've got all the white people in the city.  And I round them up and drive them down Broadway, you know, and out, you know, into..."  Well, of course, just the opposite happened.  I can't tell you how many hours I spent meeting with people, going to their homes, you know, talking to them about the need to stay in Gary... businesses that we met with, as Sears and Roebuck.  I remember we came over to their headquarters which was in downtown Chicago [Illinois], and met with the chairman of the board and some of the other officers, and tried to persuade them not to move, not to close that store in downtown Gary.  They had this large store.  And I asked this gentleman, I said, "Well, tell me why you're doing it?"  I said, "Is it that you're losing too much money through shoplifting?  I'd heard, you know, something like that?"  "Oh no, no, we have about the same amount of..." he called it slippage... "We have about the same amount of slippage there as we have at our other stores in another area."  I said, "Well, is it that you're not making a profit?  I mean, is that why?  You're not making a profit?"  "No, no, we're making a profit in that store.  We're doing okay in that store."  So, I said, "Well, what is it?  Why, I mean why would you close this store that's been in Gary forever in downtown and, you know, go someplace else?"  He says, "Well," he says, "We're going to build a new store.  We're going to be part of a shopping mall out south of the city."  And he says, "It's just our feeling that that is the path of the future, that that..."  And of course that was tapping into this white flight thing.  That was the direction that whites were fleeing to.  And so, that was, that was the path of the future.  And we did everything we could.  [HM Ronald] Ron Dellums, you know, a great member of Congress, came to Gary for a rally.  And after we left City Hall, we all kind of marched down in front of Sears.  And some of the people in the crowd, you know, they cut their charge cards, their Sears charge card.  And there were actually employees in, you know, in the windows of Sears cheering us on, saying, "Yes, you know, do that, because we don't want them to close either."  But none of that mattered.  They closed the store, built this new one out in the shopping mall which is, as I said, was just in a cornfield.  And of course, then smaller stores followed.  And the big thing was when the two banks--Gary had two large banks--they built their new headquarters out in the same area.  They built... and so that was it.  I mean small banks--I mean small businesses--if they wanted to borrow money they have to go to these banks.  These banks said basically, "Yeah, we'll loan you the money, but not if you're going to, you know, operate a business in Gary.  If you want to operate a business, you know, out in Merrillville out in that area, then we'll loan you the money."  And so, in effect, some of them really had no choice.  They had to move.  But it was a pattern that was taking place all over the country--that was happening all over the country.  And so they left, left the downtown area high and dry.
Story_ID: 78531
Speaker 1: --named this huge library after him [Chicago Mayor Harold Washington], and all of that.  But the reality, the reality is you got us once, you won't get us again.  I mean, you will not get us again.  And that's essentially to some degree the same thing that's going on in Gary [Indiana] right now.  Gary right now is a city that is eighty-five percent black... eighty-five percent black.  It has a white mayor, and what is probably more daunting is that it is likely he's going to be re-elected for another term.  It may not happen, and I certainly hope it doesn't happen--not because he's white.  I supported him at first because I thought he really had, you know, the interests of the city at heart.  No more, no more.  I mean that is very clear, that he does not.  But we have four blacks running for mayor.  If all four of them run, I guarantee you that the incumbent will win another term, there's no question about it.  But it has also to do with a kind of mindset that has developed today.  I mean, today if a black ran for mayor in Chicago [Illinois], I don't think that black could count on getting an overwhelming majority of the black vote, I really don't think so.  I think in fact they might wind up losing that to Richard [M.] Daley if someone challenges him this time.  They may wind up losing the black vote to him.  And so, so, you--given that situation, as I said almost structurally--and it has to do with our own way of thinking, you know, the way we think--that it's going to be extremely difficult for someone to be elected.  Many of our elected officials today, they, it's a different group.  As I keep saying, it's a different time, because it is.  I mean, whoever the philosopher was who said you can't stick your foot in the same river twice knew what he was talking about.  Because things do change.  It's a very dynamic situation.  Many of our elected officials today have absolutely no sense of their history and, and, and where they came from and how they got to where they are.  They just don't, they don't know.  Our young people just have very little knowledge of that, or sense of that, or awareness of that.  You know, my three girls have grown up in a home where we always talked about politics, and we talked about issues, and we talked about race relations, and all that.  But I have to keep pounding, you know, it home that, "Look, you know, this is not a situation out there where you should assume that people are going to be fair with you... are going to treat you fairly, you know, in spite of your race or whatever it is.  So, never assume that, and you should always be on the alert.  You've got to be excellent, I mean you've got to be the best.  Don't even think about being second or third or whatever, try to be the best.  And I think that's the situation we're in today.  Our elected officials think of themselves as "I'm in this position because I'm really qualified, you know, that's how I got to this position."  They have no, they don't have a clue as to why they're in the position that they're in.  And so, if they don't, then those kinds of issues--and I, the last few years when go to meetings in Washington [D.C.], those kind of issues aren't even on the table.  They aren't even discussed.  That's not even a part of the agenda anymore, you know, and so... and in part because we don't raise the issue.  And if we don't raise the issue, who's going to raise it?  I mean it's just not going to be said.
Story_ID: 78532
Speaker 1: And people have this feeling... I've gone to church in Gary [Indiana] where most of the people in church think of themselves very much as middle class.  They think they're... I mean, if not higher... you know, upper middle class.  They think of themselves in that way.  They don't... a minister began, you know, in a sermon one of the assistant ministers began talking about, you know, black pride.  In his sermon he started talking about black pride.  He, he was saying that... he made a statement, I know it upset them.  He said, "The people in Gary are stuck on stupid, because they're being entertained, you know, with the Jazz Fest and Gospel Fest and all kinds of fests, while their money is simply being taken away.  I mean, do you know that some people left the church because he was talking about, you know, talking to them that way, and that he was talking about how black people ought to assert themselves, you know, in a community where they're eighty-five percent of the population.  Some people actually left the church because you know, they felt that was so inappropriate.  "Why would he get up there and talk about things like that, you know?"  And I mean it's just amazing, so it's just a different time.  It's a different mentality out there.  And when you really think about it, people are able, the mayor of Gary is able to do things that twenty years ago would have gotten him dragged out and strung up by his thumbs or something.  But he's able... and nobody even, you know, raises a thought about it.
Story_ID: 78533
Speaker 1: Now, are there things that you would have done differently when you look back at your... you know, your administration.  Would you have done anything different?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question.  I have always had ambivalent feelings about certain people.  For example, Andy Young [HM Andrew Young]--I've always thought of Andy--and Andy Young marched with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  I mean, he took risks, you know, in those situations in those demonstrations.  He did... and on top of that, a really smart guy, a very smart guy.  The thing that always bothered me about Andy, though, was that Andy, Andy somehow had mastered the art of saying to white people, "I don't like you, and I don't like what you're doing," but saying it in a way that white people didn't mind, you know.  I mean that's an art to me, it's an absolute art.  I mean for me--I am so blunt and, you know... and just say... "Well, look, you know, I was wrong and I'm against that."  But Andy, I guess the only term that would apply--he's more diplomatic.  He's able to say things, but to say them in a way that, as I said, they aren't so threatening to white people I guess.  I guess that's... and yet I kind of, I remember the experience in 1984 in San Francisco [California] at the National Democratic Convention.  And at that convention, black people were really, the black delegates, you know, were really in a militant mood.  I mean they were not, they were not to hear-- there to hear anybody telling them, you know, that everything's going to be alright, and all of that.  They wanted to see some action, they wanted to see something happen.  And Andy got up in a meeting, we had some black Caucus meetings.  And Andy got up in a meeting, and I think really tried to explain why instead of maybe talking about a black candidate for president... [HM] Jesse [Jackson] had run, you know.  In fact, that now, you know, we needed to sort of put together whatever our thing was going to be and support the Democratic nominee for president.  I mean, I tell you people got very upset with him, got very upset with him.  And Coretta Scott King, she tried to, you know, kind of fix it for Andy.  And I understand, because Coretta loves him and he loves her.  So, she tried to sort of fix it.  But the people and those... those delegates, they just did not accept it.  So, when the time came--and Andy, I mean [HM Ronald] Ron Dellums I think announced that he might be a candidate for president.  But a lot of that was all designed to be able to get a few minutes on national television to talk about what you really wanted to talk about.  And Andy got up to... in effect... I don't know if he introduced the candidate or--but he certainly, you know, spoke.  He was booed, he was literally booed off the stage, off national television, by the black delegates, by the delegates to that convention.  And I went down and talked... he was standing back in the back.   And I went down... I mean his wife [Jean Childs]... I mean it was really terrible, because she was crying, she was down there crying.  I mean it was just a terrible thing.  And I tried to talk to her and sort of console her a little bit.  And I talked to Andy, you know.  You know, I said, "Well, Andy, you have to do what you think."  But that was a manifestation of this idea that... I mean that somehow the important thing is to sort of reach an accommodation, to you know...  And, and, and, some of us saw that as a compromise of principal, you know, not being willing to stand up and take whatever you have to take, in order to say we're, you know, our people are entitled to everything that anybody else is entitled to.
Story_ID: 78534
Speaker 1: And so, in a way I've always had mixed feelings.  I've always had on the one hand a great deal of admiration for Andy [HM Andrew Young], and you know I've always tried to be a friend, you know, to him.  On the other hand, it just seems that he has mastered too well this...  I mean, and they used to tell me, I used to hear stories about how they would... Ralph Abernathy and Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and Andy, you know, they would be debating about what they should do or what action they should take and so forth.  And, and, Andy said that many times he would be the devil's advocate.  He would be the one sort of saying the other thing, "Well, you know, maybe if you do that too much, pretty soon you're no longer the devil's advocate, you're your own advocate.  I mean, that's what you believe and you're doing.  So, I mean I see distinct differences between people.  And they all have made a tremendous contribution.  But I see differences between an Andy Young and for example, [HM] Maynard Jackson, who I thought showed unflinching courage when he stood up to the whole business community in Atlanta [Georgia] and said, "The airport will not be built unless African-Americans get forty-percent of the action," or whatever percentage.  I mean I thought that took real courage to do that.  And as it turned out, I mean there are lots of folks in Atlanta who need to be very happy.  A lot of black folks in Atlanta are very happy that Maynard had that kind of courage to stand up.  So, I see a difference.  I mean, today I see a difference between a Maxine Young or a Sheila Jackson [Lee].
Speaker 2: [HM] Maxine Waters.
Speaker 1: Maxine Waters... I'm thinking of Andy Young--Maxine Waters or a Sheila Jackson Lee on the one hand.  And then on the other hand, maybe a [HM] John Lewis.  I mean I love John, and John obviously took a beating for us that was just terrible.  But there's a difference.  There's a difference between you being willing to take whatever the consequences of telling the truth is.  And you're being, you're kind of looking for a way to kind of work it out, you know, and do it in such a way that maybe people won't be upset with you or so angry with you.  There's just a difference.  And if you look at... I mean I, I don't know Sheila Jackson Lee.  I think I passed her once in an airport.  And you know, she said hello, but I wasn't sure it was her.  So, I, you know, I didn't stop and try to talk to her.  But I love her.  I just love her, because she stands up and she speaks out.  Maxine... I mean what can you say about Maxine Waters?  I mean she's out... when she was in the California State Legislature, she was reaching beyond anything that anybody expected her to be.  She made Willie Brown the speaker of that legislature.  She made, she did that.  I got to be vice chairman of the National Democratic Party because Maxine said, "You know, it's time for us to pick our own, and not let them select somebody for us."  And, and, so she was like probably the very first one that said to me, "You ought to run for vice chairman of the Democratic Party.  So, so, people like that, I think they are the ones that it if a change is going to come, they are the ones that will bring about that change.  Because they're not afraid, they're not worried about whether people like them or think they're nice people, or anything like that.  They're not... that is not an issue with them.  What they are looking for is truth and justice and fairness, and they're going to go for that no matter what, and no matter who.  I don't care if you talked to-- I can see some of the discussions and debates that take place in the Congress.  And you look at...  Maxine Waters does not hesitate to take on presidents, the leaders of her party; she doesn't care.  I mean she, if they need to be told the truth, she tells them the truth.

Speaker 1: And so, and you've got... I'm really pleased because we have a number of people in the Congressional Black Caucus that are like that.  And it used to be you'd count [HM Ronald] Ron Dellums and maybe one or two others, and that was it.  But now, you know, we've got a number of people that, they just, they don't take anything.  And I've watched the evolution and the growth of... what's the man from New York [New York City, New York]?  [HM] Al Sharpton...  I've watched Al Sharpton, you know.  And Al Sharpton has gone from a person I think who probably would be described as a hustler, to a real statesman--a person who speaks, and speaks with seriousness and directness, and who is impossible to ignore.  And he's grown.  I mean, to his credit, he has just absolutely grown.  And so, you look at people like that, and you say "Well, we've got... you know, we've got the people to get the job done... we've got the people to get the job done.  The only thing we haven't been able to do I think up to this point, we have not been able to sort of bring it all together.  Because now we have a presence in the corporate world, you know, it's not a great presence, but we have a presence in the corporate world.  That's something that when the 1972 convention took place in Gary [Indiana], when the National Black Political Convention took place in Gary, we didn't have like businesspeople that were officers in huge corporations--I mean, a Reginald Lewis, you know, who winds up owning a Fortune 500 company [Beatrice Foods].  We didn't have... we didn't have that resource available.  We have it now.  In 1972, we did not have eight thousand black elected officials around the country at every level.  We have that, we have that now.  In 1972 we did not even have, we had a few academics.  I mean we had a guy like [HM] Derrick Bell, you know, who was a real thinker, but just a very few.  But now, I mean it's hard to go to any major university in this country and not see at least two or three--not enough by any means--but not see at least two or three blacks, you know, you know what they're doing--who absolutely know what they're doing.  So, we've got resources today that we never had before.  We just haven't been able to really pull it together.  And our issues, unfortunately, have been pushed into the background.  They're... in fact in one sense there's a lot of talk, well, you know, the fastest growing minority are Hispanics and Latin Americans.  It's sort of like you all aren't significant anymore.  Well, if we allow that, if we allow that... first of all, if we don't get together with the Hispanics and work on a common agenda, put together a common agenda...  But if we allow ourselves to be so disrespected that we can be just sort of shoved aside...  And when you think about it, from the very beginning of this country, that's what has happened to us.  We've been moved aside.  Every new group that comes in, they move them right over us.  We have to stop that.  And we can stop that.  I mean it really is about leadership, about the kind of leadership--how strong that leadership is and, and, and, you know, its ability to pull all of us together--to pull all of us together and set some common goals and set some time limits.  And say, you know, "By such and such this is what's going to happen."  That's what, that's what I think we absolutely need to do.
Story_ID: 78536
Speaker 1: It is a disgrace... it is an absolute total disgrace that this country has never had a black man or a black woman sitting in the White House.  That is just absolutely... and the most disgraceful thing is that somehow people see it as a natural state of affairs.  It is not a natural state of affairs.  We are a significant part of this population.  We have made huge contributions to the building and development of this country.  All of those things... and to say, "Yes, but you're not good enough to hold the number one spot."  And I even hear blacks say, "Oh, it's going to be years, you know, before..."  No, I mean, that... we ought to thinking in terms of doing that the next time around.
Speaker 2: So you, that's why you were so excited and got on the bandwagon of [HM] Reverend Jesse Jackson when he was running?
Speaker 1: Oh, without a doubt.  Again, some people do us a service, and sometimes we don't realize it's a service.  Because people said everything in the world about Jesse Jackson, you know.  "Oh, he's such an egotist."  And, "You know, he's just in it for whatever he can... he's a..."  Jesse Jackson, I tell people, is like a national treasure for us.  That's what he is, he's a national treasure.  Because he ran a race.  Shirley Chisholm ran for president in 1972.  Shirley Chisholm ran, and in one sense... even though we couldn't get Shirley to come to the 1972 black political convention... because people around her had told her that if you go there, they're going to embarrass you.  You know, they're not going to, they're not going to endorse you; they're going to embarrass you.  Just the opposite was true.  If Shirley had come to that convention, people would have just gone up and spoke in support of her.  They would have gone up and supported her.  So as a consequence, I think in part of that, her campaign never really got going.  It never, you know, caught on.
Story_ID: 78537
Speaker 1: But if you come to 1984 and look at the first race that [HM] Jesse [Jackson] ran, with no money, no...  I remember a minister from California saying that, "I'm going to ask my people for a dollar.  And if we can get enough folks to give us a dollar, we'll have enough money, you know, to run an election."  No resources to run an election.  The only real resource was that black people had a sense of the history of the moment, and Jesse Jackson understood the history of the moment.  And so, and because he is such a capable person... he is such a unique individual... I mean I don't know if Jesse's ever had his IQ tested or something, but it has to be off the chart.  It has to be off the chart, because he can analyze, synthesize, and summarize anything in the world.  You give him a five hundred word book, I mean a five hundred page book, and he'll do that.  So, he's a really capable person.  And so, in that position, he said, "Yes, I'm willing to do it."  I sat in the room when a whole group of our black leaders sat around the table.  And the discussion was should a black run for president?  Should a black run?  This is 1983, should a black run for president?   And, and, it came down to a poll around the table saying, "Well, John, what about you?  I mean, why don't... what about you running?"  "No, I can't run, because I've got this or that."  All the way around that table it went.  Everybody declined.  And so they got to Jesse, and Jesse said, "Well, if nobody else will run, I'll run... I will run."  And it was so amazing to me that after that, outside the room, you know, in little private conversations people were saying, "You see, I knew Jesse Jackson was just trying to get us to endorse him for president.  And I told him, I can't make any endorsement.  I can't say I'm going to support him until I go back and meet with my board.  I've got to meet..."  I mean there were things like that going around.  And yet, they had sat there at that table, and every one of them had had an opportunity to say "Yes, I'll run," and every one of them had an excuse.  And every one of them had an excuse.  Every one of them had a reason that they couldn't run right now, this wasn't the right time for them.  But Jesse didn't hesitate.  I mean, he just stepped up.  And he said, "I'll run it.  If nobody else wants to run, I will run."  And so, what he did was to take us to another level.  He took us to another level.  He did not win.  I don't recall the number of votes he got, but he got a large number of votes.
Story_ID: 78538
Speaker 1: And it sort of set the stage for 1988 when he [HM Reverend Jesse Jackson] ran.  And, and, that was the most serious campaign for president that any black has ever run in this country.  And, as a matter of fact when he... if just a couple things had gone in a different direction, I really believe that he would have won the nomination for president.  Because after Super Tuesday, he came in either first or second in about twenty-five different states, on Super Tuesday.  I mean, he was either first or he was second.  The momentum of that carrying him--and I regret very much because he's a friend of mine.  But [United States Senator] Paul Simon, Paul Simon was a great Senator and a good person.  But the fact is that Paul Simon would not withdraw and allow Jesse to... Jesse was going to win Illinois.  He was going to win Illinois if Paul Simon had withdrawn.  But I know people around Paul Simon got to him, because at that point, Senator Simon knew that he couldn't win.  He knew he couldn't win the nomination.  But people around him said, "No, stay in.  Stay in, because I'm a delegate, you know, on your ticket.  And therefore, you know, don't pull out."  But if he had pulled out, Jesse would have won Illinois.  And then if you recall, he went to Michigan.  He won Michigan, I mean absolutely won Michigan.  It was just amazing, you know, and it shocked so many people, but he won the state.  And then there were some things that happened in Wisconsin that should not have happened.  I mean it was just, it just should not have happened.  Some people made some serious errors and antagonized... I mean I think they antagonized every black minister in the state of Wisconsin.  You know, it shouldn't have happened.  But that hurt him, because then he dropped down in Wisconsin, you know.  And then on to New York [New York City, New York] and [Edward] Koch, and all of that.  But he would have been successful there.  As it was, he won New York City, you know.  And Jesse was... I think if [Al] Gore could have stayed in the race instead of dropping out after New York... if Gore could have stayed in the race so that you had this three person tandem going, then Jesse would have won a lot of other states as he went.  But when it became a head-up race between Jesse and [Michael] Dukakis, you know, in those states as you moved west, I mean it was... it just didn't happen.  But to have given us that and to have given us a blueprint, and to have shown us... to have shown us how to run for president--which is a completely different idea all in itself, running for president.  But he has, he has now broken that barrier, you know, he has shown us how to do it.  I think that was a great service to the country.  And there is no one else in America that I know of that just, on the issues, is as consistent and as persistent as Jesse Jackson is.  He is out there on the case.  When no one is saying anything, he's out there on the case.  So I, I just think he's a tremendous resource that we have.  And as I said, we have other people that are very good and very good at certain things.  And what we've got to learn to do is to bring it all together and agree on some things.  We've just got to agree on some things.  Where do we want to go, say, by this next election?  Are we going to be back in the position of choosing between people that in a sense we don't really believe in, which is because you know...  And then we get all split up; somebody's over in this camp, somebody's over in that camp.  And even that wouldn't be bad if our interests... if we have common interests.  If we said, "Okay, I'm over here..."
Story_ID: 78214
Speaker 1: [Donald] Rumsfield and the Justice... the Attorney General [John Ashcroft]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean, they are absolutely on one side, and [HM] Colin Powell's over here, you know.  I mean on this issue of Iraq, he does not want... he knows, he sees the stupidity of doing something like that.  And yet, you know, he's a part of the administration, so he doesn't come out publicly and say that.  I don't think he's a very happy man at this point, you know, within the Republican Party.  So if Colin Powell were to announce, "I've decided, you know, after searching my conscious and talking to the people, that I have decided to change parties," then I think Colin Powell could become the first black president of the United States.  I think he has everything that it takes to do that.  And some people might say, "Well, you know, that's not great."  That may be going back to my concern, you know, about Andy [HM Andrew Young] and others.  But I think the thing that I appreciated about Colin Powell was when he first sort of jumped into that pit.  He, you know, they tried to get him to come out against affirmative action, to come against things.  And he wouldn't do it.  And he stood... "You know, I believe in affirmation action.  I wouldn't be where I am if it weren't for affirmative action."  And so, you know, his principles caused him to stand up, even though it made him very unpopular with the far right, certainly of the Republican Party.  So there are things that he has done, even in that environment, that I think I can admire, I can appreciate.  And if he were to become a Democrat, I think I could vote for Colin Powell, I could do it.
Story_ID: 78215
Speaker 1: Now, there are other blacks that I could vote for, you know.  Obviously, I have high respect and appreciation for [HM Reverend] Jesse [Jackson].  I have high appreciation and respect for [HM] Maxine [Waters].  There are four or five other people.  I was really disappointed in young Harold Ford [Jr.], because he's really a bright and capable young man.  I was very impressed with him, you know.  And I talked to his mother [Dorothy Bowles Ford] once when she, that was before he ran.  But she told me, she said "Well, you know, Harold, Harold [Ford], Sr., he's not going to run again.  But, you know, our son is going to run.  He's going to be a candidate."  And I was really elated. I said, you know, "That's great.  We'll have some young people in the Congress."  But this last move, you know, that he made, that was... that was very disappointing to me.  Because what he in essence was saying was the Democrats lost because they were too liberal, and that they need to move...  Wow, remember this is the same party that was moved to the right by [President William] Bill Clinton and the Senator from Virginia, [Charles "Chuck"] Robb.  And you know, they went through that Democratic Leadership Council thing to say we've got to move the party closer to the center.  Now, here's this young man saying that's not far enough, we need to move further.  We need to become more like Republicans.  Well, you know, as the old saying goes, "the last thing this country needs is two Republican parties."  And the more the Democrats try to be like the Republicans, I think the more they lose their vote, their historical base, and, and, the less their chances are of winning.  So, I was disappointed when he did that.  Now, maybe that was an aberration, because I heard him speak at the convention, and I mean he was good, he was really, really good.  So, he is obviously a very capable young man--
Story_ID: 78216
Speaker 1: But somehow I think you've got to say to young people and old people alike, "Look, we did not get where we were trying to appease people.  We made the greatest progress in our history in the sixties [1960s], when riots were going on and when militancy was at a maximum.  That's when we made the greatest progress as a people."  So, if you, if you really look at history, you'll find that appeasing discrimination and racism doesn't work, it doesn't work for us.  And what we have to do is stand up, and we have to speak up, and we have to stop apologizing for the fact that we want to be equal and treated equally.  I mean that's nothing to apologize for.  That's something that people ought to be apologizing to us, because they have not treated us that way.  And so, that's the ingredient that I see at least that seems to be missing, you know, in 2002.  It seems to be missing, and that's what I think we really ought to give some thought to, and think about--how do we re-capture... you know, why aren't we angry?  Why aren't we upset about what is happening to us?  You know, police brutality is on the rise in this country.  It's not going down, it's on the rise.  So, you know, if we just sit back and watch this, anything might happen, anything might happen.  And we've already reached the point now just in the last several months where racial profiling has become acceptable, respectable.  It's respectable to engage in racial profiling in the name of, "Oh, we're fighting the terrorists, we're fighting the terrorists."  In the meantime, many of those gains that black people made in the sixties [1960s] and seventies [1970s] are being just taken away, just quietly taken away.  So, I never thought I'd see the day in America--and this shows my own naivete--when it would be possible to arrest an American citizen, hold him incommunicado, not allow them to see a lawyer, not allow them to see anyone; no one knows where they are; nobody knows what condition they're in.  I never thought that I was... that's the kind of stuff I used to read about in Nazi, Germany.  That's, that's what happened in Nazi, Germany.  And for America, you know, that holds itself out as this democratic, freedom loving, basic constitutional rights loving kind of country--to be engaging in what we've seen since September 11th [2001] is just, it's just a tragedy, it's just a tragedy to me.  I just never thought I'd see that happen.
Story_ID: 78217
Speaker 1: Mr. Hatcher, with Gary [Indiana] and your administration, and I'm talking about-- for those people who would say you stayed too long, or the whole... the state of the city was based on you.  How do you... what does, what does... how does that feel to you?
Speaker 2: Well, what I think... first of all I would agree with people about staying too long.  I, and let me try to explain that.  Because in a way I do agree, and in a way I don't.  But I would not seriously disagree with them.  Because I think in public office and in public life, it is not--it's good to be there long enough to be able to do the things that you feel you can do.  There are some things you're not going to be able to do if you stay there fifty years.  But to do the things...  But then once you do those things, I think that in public life you should be... you should then be able to move on up to a higher office, or to another position.  You know, and people I'm sure would laugh.  But if I had my druthers, I'd be running for president; I wouldn't be running for, you know, mayor or City Council; I'd be running for president.  I mean I feel I am best suited, most suited to do... that's the office that I'm best suited for.  Now, I know obviously many people--if not a 101 percent, pretty close to a 100 percent--disagree.  But that's, that's just the way I feel.  Now, say, so it meant that as mayor I wanted to do what I could do.  I wanted to help the city, I wanted to help the people of the city.  I wanted to make the best contribution that I could make, and then I really wanted to move up, you know.  Even if it had meant like running for the U.S. Senate--that would have been something that would...  I didn't quite like the idea of running for Congress, because there's so many Congresspersons... you've got to sit around for twenty years before, you know, you get seniority before you can really have any influence.  But the Senate, that would have been okay.  Running for governor, I wouldn't mind running for... minded running for governor.  But as I said, president, vice president... those are not things that I saw beyond my reach--you know, in other words that could not, could not be attained.  But the reality of that situation was exactly that.  The reality was that no black was going to be elected at that time to be governor of the State of Indiana or United States Senator.  Richard Lugar became mayor of Indianapolis [Indiana] at the same time I became mayor of Gary.  He served two terms, and then moved on and ran for the U.S. Senate, and he's sitting there today as one of the most powerful members of the Senate.  That path was not open, it was never open to me.  That opportunity was never open to me, as it was not open to pretty much every other black in the country.  I mean look at the... you can count on one hand the number of black Senators that we've had, you know, in all this time.  So, that's where I would have gone.  I mean, I think that probably after three terms, I would have said, "Now, I'd like to go for something else."  But having to be... I mean being in Indiana, let me put it that way... those avenues were just closed off to me.  I mean that opportunity was simply not available to me.  So, really, the last two times that I ran for mayor--you know, it wasn't that I didn't work hard and didn't try to do the best job that I could for the people.  But you know, my heart and thinking was going up, and not, you know, staying in that same place.  But it was just cut off, it was not... it simply was not available to me as it was to Dick Lugar--you know, as it was... seems to be for just a lot of other people that I've known in politics.  It just wasn't, it wasn't...  I had a couple of offers to... I had an offer to work... President [Jimmy] Carter invited me to work in the White House, you know, as an Assistant to the President.  I turned that down.  I've had some other offers, you know, to do things in Washington [D.C.].  But I'm very interested in elective office.  I mean, that's the kind of office that I'm extremely interested in, not appointed office.  And so, in my circumstance, it's as if I almost had no choice--I have to run for mayor again.  I have to run for mayor again and again and again.
Story_ID: 78218
Speaker 1: So from that standpoint, from that standpoint, you say, "Well, what would you have done differently if you could?"  Probably after maybe three terms, four at a maximum, I would have run for some other office.  I would have run, you know, for a national office.  That's what I would have liked to have done.  Now part of the reasons that, you know, that was not available to me, of course, is that I have always in my public life, have always tried to speak up for our people.  I've always tried to speak up and speak out for our people.  I've always tried to support helping poor people.  I mean, I always... I knew what it was like to be poor.  I, I, you know, I've had that experience in my own background.  And so, I've always wanted to... in every office I've always held, I've always to try to help poor people.  And sometimes when you do that, that brings you flush, face-to-face with the power in this country, which is economic--the power in this country.  And so, you have a choice, you know.  You can sort of back away, or you can stand and take whatever the consequences.  For me, I really believe that one of the consequences has been that I have not--I mean that opportunity to move up, to become a U.S. Senator, to become a vice president of the United States, to become a president--that opportunity has not been available to me.  I had a reporter from a San Francisco [California] newspaper tell me really something very interesting before the 1984 Democratic [National] Convention.  And, you know, I never, I never mentioned this to [HM Reverend] Jesse [Jackson].  But we had had a lot of meetings.  And some of those meetings had been pretty hot.  Because we were demanding, you know, that blacks have a proportional share of everything that went on at the convention--all the contracts, all the committees, all--you know, everything.  That, I mean that was our position.  And there had been a lot of meetings, and Jesse had led those meetings.  I mean he, you know, he was the one that had been the candidate, so he had led those meetings.  And so, I happened to run into this reporter in San Francisco before the convention.  And he had resigned... whatever newspaper... he had resigned.  And he was now on the staff of Vice-President [Walter] Mondale, he was on his staff.  And so, we were talking about some of these kind of hot meetings that had taken place.  And I said, "Well, you know, Reverend Jackson is not going to back down.  He is going to be, you know, he is going to stand for those things that we talked about."  He said, "Let me tell, you."  He said, "We were not worried about Jesse Jackson."  He said, "We were worried about you."  He said, "You were the one in those meetings that was upsetting, you know, everybody.  Because, you know, it looked like you were not willing to compromise.  You were not willing to do something."  And I thought about that later.  As I said, I never mentioned that to Jesse, but I thought about that.  And I said, you know, when I look back, I have always tried to be as straight as I could be.  I just, I didn't want to be saying one thing to people and believing something else, or meaning or intending something else.  And so, I can say... I mean first of all, you know, he was wrong about--I mean Jesse is the most formidable person that we have.  I mean, I have no doubt about that.  But I think the idea--what they were upset with was that I was not trying to paint it over, or make it look any better than it was.  I was saying to them exactly what, you know, what I was thinking.  And so, I think about that and I say, "Well, you know, maybe that's part of your problem, too.  Maybe that's why, you know, you don't wind up maybe having this opportunity to really go for something, you know, that is very large."  I don't know.  But I don't really regret what has happened.  I mean I think that I've always tried to do what was right.  And if that--you know, if the price that you pay for that is that maybe these chances or opportunities to run... because that's how it always works out.  Someone says, "Well, what about Hatcher for this, you know?"  I mean, someplace that you're not... and so it sort of gets going that way.  But if that doesn't happen for me, as I said, I feel that I've had a wonderful life.  I've had a wonderful opportunity to participate in things that, in truth, I never dreamed I'd be able to participate in.  And so in that sense, you know, I have no regrets, and, and, would not do anything differently today, you know, than I did at whatever the time was.
Story_ID: 78219
Speaker 1: I have two, possibly three questions left.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: One is... the legacy of the black mayor in the urban area.  What did you, how did you...  Has that legacy really been fulfilled?  Because we have urban areas that are decaying, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, and so, I'm wondering can you point to one case?  Because one can say, you know, we stand on the shoulders that come before us, and--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And many people have stood on your shoulders.  But I'm just wondering what your thoughts--
Speaker 2: Well, I think first of all, one of the legacies that would apply particularly to black mayors--although black-- all mayors have problems.  But one is the idea that the problems that cities face can be overcome, can be resolved.  And there's a number of good examples of that.  The truth is that before Maynard Jackson became mayor of Atlanta [Georgia], Atlanta wasn't this great city that everybody talks about today.  It really was not.  And so, while people may not want to give him the credit for a lot of that, he deserves it.  If you look at Cleveland [Ohio], I mean, Cleveland used to be a joke, absolutely a joke, the mistake by the lake, I mean and all of that.  I think that Carl's [Carl Stokes] contribution to Cleveland hasn't yet been measured.  I think that [Michael] Mike White's contribution to Cleveland--if you go to Cleveland... Cleveland is not the city that it was, say, when Carl first became mayor.  It is a very different city.  It is a city that shows growth and prosperity, and what they've done on that lakefront, you know, with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the football stadium and the science facility [Great Lakes Science Center].  I mean, that's just great.  I mean... and so Cleveland in many ways is a different city.  Does Cleveland... has Cleveland solved all of its problems?  No, not by a long shot.  But it is a better city today.  And I think Carl Stokes and Michael White can take credit for it.  There was another mayor [George Voinovich] who was the, he was the Governor of Ohio and then became Mayor of Cleveland.  And he did, I thought, a very, very good job.  I thought he did a very, very good job as mayor.  So that's one legacy, I think, that these cities have terrific problems.  But they can be dealt with, they can be addressed.  Everyone's calling Rudy Giuliani America's mayor.  I mean, think about what people were saying about Rudy Giuliani before September 11th [2001].  Let's think about that--that he was a right-wing... always backed policemen when they treated minorities brutally... always apologized--I mean you know, made excuses for them and all of that.  He was not very well liked at all.  So, America's mayor?  I don't think so.  I don't think he's America's mayor.  I think [HM] David Dinkins did a good job of keeping New York [New York City, New York] together through a most difficult time... a most difficult time.  But you don't give David very much credit at all.  But I see that as one of the legacies, you know, of black mayors.  Now, one other thing.  I think about people like [Ernest Nathan] Dutch Morial down in [New Orleans] Louisiana, who really did a fine job.  You've got... when you start putting the whole record together of what black mayors accomplished and what they had to overcome in order to overcome--that's the other thing that you always have to put in the mix--then I think that you'll see that black mayors have been a true benefit to urban America.
Story_ID: 78220
Speaker 1: They have... and they've been creative.  If you look at the black mayors today and compare them to my generation of black mayors--the [Kenneth] Ken Gibsons [mayor of Newark, New Jersey], the Coleman Youngs [mayor of Detroit, Michigan] and a number of those of us--most of us came out of some kind of civil rights movement.  That was sort of our background... that we came out...  Most of the black mayors today did not come out of the Civil Rights Movement.  In fact, most of them, you know, haven't really participated or have (unclear)...  But what I think is different today is that the black mayors of today are better trained, they're better educated than the mayors of my day.  I mean, obviously there were exceptions.  I mean, Ken Gibson was an engineer, you know, and all that.  And Maynard [Jackson], you know, Maynard certainly has an outstanding educational background.  But for the most part, the mayors today are better trained and better educated.  Unfortunately, they are not--and they're very knowledgeable of how a city works and what makes a city work, and you know, budgetary requirements and so forth.  They're very knowledgeable of that.  What I think they lack, if they lack anything, is the passion for justice, for wanting to see things be done right, and wanting to see people treated absolutely fairly, no matter what their race and no matter what their color might be.  Now, that's not a fatal flaw, because that's something I think you can learn or you can get.  But if there was anything that I would suggest may be missing somewhat today among black mayors--because a lot of that's been missing a long time among white mayors--but among black mayors, it would be that.  Not their ability, not their... they're very capable, very able.  But they, I think in part because they didn't come through that period where, you know, you couldn't even go into a restaurant and be served.  That's something that they simply were not a part of.  Now, in some cases, if you take [HM] Marc Morial, the mayor of New Orleans [Louisiana]--his father, [Ernest Nathan] Dutch Morial, you know, sort of passed that on to him.  So, I see in people like Marc, you know, that willingness to stand up and to speak up, and to speak out.  But many of them did not have the benefit--you know, the father who was mayor before you.  And so as a consequence, they feel-"I'm mayor because I'm really the best qualified person to be here, and I am the person..."  I've never met [HM] Ron Kirk, for example who's mayor--I think that's his name--Ron Kirk, who was mayor of Dallas [Texas] and ran for, I think, the U.S. Senate this time [2002].  I've never met him.  But I don't know whether Ron is really committed to the proposition that black people are going to be equal, no matter what it takes.  I'm not saying that he's not, because I don't know him, I don't know him.  But it's just that... I think if that were the case, I think I'd know it.  I think I would be aware of it, even though I've never met him.

Speaker 1: Where is Richard Hatcher today?
Speaker 2: On--
Speaker 1: I mean, who is the Richard Hatcher of today?  Or what--
Speaker 2: Today?
Speaker 1: Today.
Speaker 2: That's really a good question.  I think that I have... I'm essentially the same person.  I remember hearing Paul Robeson over a recording in Carnegie Hall.  Because he was ill, and was he in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and he couldn't travel to Carnegie Hall for this tribute to him.  I think [HM] Harry Belafonte put the tribute together.  And, and, the lights were dimmed, the lights were down.  And suddenly, there was this booming voice, this powerful booming voice.  And he said, "I'm the same old Paul.  I have not changed."  And I guess for me, I feel I'm the same old Richard Hatcher.  I'm the same person.  My views have not changed on most things.  Some things they have, because I think if you can't change, you know, then you're not still growing.  Right now, my passion is to build a national Civil Rights Hall of Fame.  I've been working on that for a number of years, along with a number of other people.  And, and, and that right now, that's my goal, to build a national Civil Rights Hall of Fame.  Because I think, as [HM] Lerone Bennett [Jr.] said, "If we don't build it, every day these really important artifacts of a movement that changed the very face of America are being lost."  And so, if we don't bring those things together under one roof so that they can be preserved for our children and our children's children, then that's our fault; that's our fault if we don't do that.  And so, right now that is my passion.  I want to see--and I believe that an African-American is going to become President of the United States.  And I want to see that happen.  Not twenty years from now, not twenty-five years from now--I want to see it happen in the next election, in the next election.  If Al Gore, nice guy... but if Al Gore is good enough to run for president twice, then don't tell me that there are not African-Americans who at least ought to be given the opportunity to run for president once.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I truly cannot answer, and to leave to whatever... anyone that cares.  Because I don't know, because I don't think of it in terms of leaving a legacy.  I just think of it as the things I want to do.  I have three beautiful daughters, truly beautiful daughters.  The middle girl, the middle girl [Regan Hatcher] has just recently announced that she's going to be a candidate for my old seat in the City Council [Council-at-large of Gary, Indiana].
Story_ID: 78539
Speaker 1: This a photograph, this is the only time in my life that I met Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] in person.  And Dr. King had come to Gary [Indiana] to make a speech at St. John's Baptist Church.  And the Reverend Julius James, who's sitting right next to Dr. King, he and Dr. King were classmates at Morehouse [College] in Atlanta [Georgia].  And so, Reverend James had invited Dr. King to come to Gary to speak.  And Dr. King was in this little restaurant in Gary, and Reverend James called me.  I was a member of the City Council at the time.  And Reverend James called me and asked me to come down to the restaurant, that Dr. King was there, and he wanted to introduce me to him.  And I did, and Dr. King said "Well, why don't we take a picture?  Why don't we take a photograph?"  And so this is, this is the photograph that was taken.  As I said, I had the opportunity to actually touch this great man and to meet him and to get to know him.  When I ran for mayor a number of years after that [in 1967], Dr. King was not going to come to Gary, because there was a political conflict in Gary, and instead he went to Cleveland [Ohio] and spoke on behalf of Carl Stokes.  But he did issue a statement endorsing my candidacy also in Gary.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a photograph that was taken at the White House [Washington, D.C.] in the Rose Garden.  And at the time--this was in 1981 I believe, or 1980, I was president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.  And behind me and to my left is President Jimmy Carter, of course.  And next to President Carter is Moon Landrieu.  And at the time Moon was, I think, Mayor of New Orleans [Louisiana], and he was very active in the National-- U.S. Conference of Mayors.  There, I believe the person next to Moon is the... was the Secretary... was [Robert] Bob Weaver, the Secretary of HUD [Housing and Urbana Development], he became Secretary of HUD.  And I believe the gentleman next to him was the Mayor of Paterson, New Jersey.  And that, I'm not absolutely certain about that.  But I know he and the other two gentlemen, I believe, were mayors.  But I was president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors at that time.  And we were at the White House to lobby the President on behalf of more aid, more assistance for the cities of the United States.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: This photograph was taken in Johannesburg, South Africa.  Nelson Mandela, who had recently been freed from prison, and had subsequently run for and been elected Prime Minister, or President of South Africa, had invited a group of us to come to South Africa.  At the time, I was chairman of the TransAfrica.  And then Randall Robinson was the executive director.  And so, Randall and I had put together a delegation to come to South Africa to spend some time working with Nelson Mandela with regards to the government that he was putting together.  And in this particular photograph at the time, one of our three daughters was, I think about eleven years old.  And she, when she learned that I was going to South Africa and there might be a possibility of meeting Nelson Mandela, she made me take a vow that I would not leave South Africa without an autograph from this great man.  And so after our meeting had taken place, and Nelson Mandela was speaking to the group that was assembled there, he said, "I understand that I have an absolute responsibility to make it possible for Mayor Hatcher to go back home.  And that is that I must sign an autograph for his daughter."  And so, this is a picture of him receiving the paper upon which he then wrote a very nice message to my daughter and signed his name, which I might say to this day--she is 19 years today--and she has that framed autograph from Nelson Mandela in her, on the wall of her room.  This was a great meeting, because other people such as [HM] Quincy Jones, Arthur Ashe, and a number of other very prominent Americans came to South Africa, met with the leaders of South Africa, and exchanged ideas as to how we could be mutually helpful to each other--how they could help African-Americans in our country, and how African-Americans could be helpful to them.  And President Mandela was indeed a most gracious and kind host.  And the three days that we were in South Africa we saw him every day, and he spent a considerable amount of time with us.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: President [Jimmy] Carter had asked me to come to the White House.  And when I arrived there, he offered me a position in his administration as an Assistant to the President.  And he had called me into the Oval Office to discuss this with me, and we were talking about it.  And I first of all was very surprised to be offered such a position.  But I also advised him that I could not make a decision immediately, that I would have to go back to Gary and talk to my family, and talk to people whom I worked with in our administration, and that I was honored to be offered such a position but that I would have to get back within a few days.  And he was very accepting of that.  This was at the point, I think this would have probably been around 1979 or 1980, because it was at a point where he was going to be up for re-election in a couple of years, in a year or so.  And he was in the process of shaking up his administration--that is, re-organizing his administration, bringing in some new people.  And he seemed to feel that I might be able to help, particularly in connection with cities and mayors around the country and civil rights.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: This picture was also taken in South Africa, in Johannesburg, South Africa.  Because while we were there, there was an opportunity for us to individually spend some time with each other, and to talk.  And I'm talking here, of course, with the great [HM] Quincy Jones, a musical genius--everyone knows that--but a person who is truly committed and dedicated to equal rights and equal justice.  And he had traveled to South Africa with us under the auspices of TransAfrica, and was one of the key members of that delegation.  And he, I'm not quite sure what it is that he's explaining to me here, but we had, really had a wonderful time.  And it was an opportunity--I'd had known Quincy for a number of years.  But this was really the first time that we'd had an opportunity to spend time together.  Coming down... it's a sixteen hour flight down to Johannesburg, South Africa and back.  So, there was a lot of time on a plane that we were able to talk with each other, and talk about all kinds of different things.  That was true also of the late and very great Arthur Ashe.  He was on that trip, and there was time to spend time with him and to discuss a number of things.  So, this was part of, part of the, what was called the Tour for Democracy in South Africa.  And we spent a great deal of time as the guests of Nelson Mandela.
