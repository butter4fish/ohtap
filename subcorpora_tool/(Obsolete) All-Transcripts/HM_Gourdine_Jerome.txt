Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  Yeah, December, Christmas.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  And what about food?  What do you like to eat?
Speaker 2: Everything, unfortunately.  I have to watch my--you know, I was telling somebody the other day that I like--I used to live to eat, and now I eat to live.  So, I--yeah, (laughter) everything basically.    But I don't eat it like that anymore.  You know, chicken.
Speaker 1: That's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you know, I got to be--chicken, fish, rice, stuff like that, vegetables of all kinds, it doesn't matter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you go on vacation, what is your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite phrase?
Speaker 2: Oh, I got a lot of those.  My dad [Thomas Gourdine] sticks with you, you know.  It seems like the older I get, the more wiser my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] and father become.  One was, t- tomorrow is another day.  Don't throw rocks and live in a glass house.
Story_ID: 598050
Speaker 1: Tell me about your parents.  Tell me your mother's name.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was--because she's passed on--was Elizabeth Victoria Stafford [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine]--that was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Savannah, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Do you know wh- when?
Speaker 2: You know, I never thought about it.  I think she got--she was four years old, so had to have been--1916, I think it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I never knew them, only what they told me about them.  On my mother's side, they say my great-grandfather was a great singer.  He was a deacon in the church, that's what I was told.  He was a great singer.  My grandfather, I don't, I never got that.  Because it was my mom's father and her sister's father had some problems, where he later left my mother's mother.  So, they really didn't talk about him a lot (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you know his name at all?
Speaker 2: You know I--vaguely.  It comes to me, but I will take a wild guess.  But I heard that name, and right now it's like George Henry [ph.] something.  I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 598051
Speaker 1: Now your father's name, what is your father's name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My, my father's name was Thomas Elliot Gourdine [Thomas Gourdine].
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1912, I believe it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about his parents [Elizabeth Gourdine and William Gourdine]?
Speaker 2: His parents, as I remembered, his father--my great-grandfather, I had a picture of him somewhere, he was a very distinguished looking man.  I can't remember his name.  But what they did was they switched names.  Like you know, say, Thomas Elliot--Elliot, you know, that kind of thing.  And they did my brother the same way, they switched his name.  And I'm not accurate enough to know, and to be precise as to actually what my grandfather's name was.  But I got a gut feeling that there was a Thomas in there somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did your father ever talk about your heritage on his side?
Speaker 2: You know, my father--my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] talked more about it than my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was the kind of man that really--he was a, he was a present man--what's happening now.  We would discuss politics.  In fact, he was the one who got me interested in that.  But he never really talked about it much.  Yes, he did, but not about his, his father as much as he talked about his mother, my grandmother, who I remember as a little boy, and his--my Aunt Eleanor [Eleanor Gourdine], my Aunt Wilhelmina [ph.], and my Aunt Naomi [ph.]--who I got to call, her birthday's coming up--and all these people.  Aunt Eleanor was very special and I got to know her, which was really good for me.  But that's on my father's side.  He never talked much about my, my, his father, but I have a picture somewhere in the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's kind of old.
Speaker 1: What about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was, I remember just as clear as a bell, I used to love to run behind her.  So I was only about eight, seven or eight years old.  She died when I was pretty young, maybe about nine, eight.  She died of breast cancer.  And all I can remember was her--is she helped to name me.  And I remember that I liked to take her slippers and run with them and hide them from her.  That I remember as a little boy.  And she used to make these peanut butter cookies, I remember that as clear as a (unclear).  Boy, I loved them peanut butter cookies about her.  And she was a very gentle lady, very nice.  And that stays in my brain.  Oh, she was sure nice.  I wish I would have known here a little bit longer.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: You know, it's a shame.  I don't actually remember my grandmother's name.  I do, but my brain won't connect as to what her name was.  I don't know why that is.  I don't know if there's anything significant about it, but I just can't remember.  It does--it came in my brain just now, and then it left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe later on I can let you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.  So, as a child, did you travel to Charleston?
Speaker 2: No.  My brothers did, though.  They went a lot when I was a little boy.  Why I didn't go, I don't know.  But yet I knew everything that was going on down there through my brothers coming back and telling me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about the South at that time, which wasn't a lot of fun.  And they would come back and tell me these things.  And I got to the point where I started saying, I don't want to go down there.  I don't want to--you know, I don't care.  You know, I'd kind of--if I didn't end up down there I said, okay, I don't care.  Because I had heard all these negative things about where my father came from and stuff.  And I heard some positive things, too.
Story_ID: 598052
Speaker 1: Well you said that your mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] had more knowledge about her heritage?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me, tell me what you know.
Speaker 2: Well my mother told me things about her sister, my Aunt Ellen [ph.], and how she was--who she was.  She was like the matriarch.  She told me that when her mother died she was a very little girl, maybe about eight, ten, eleven, something--ten.  And she said, her sisters, which was my aunts, who I loved the ground they walked on--these women helped raise me and my brother with my father [Thomas Gourdine] and all of them.  She said that, she said when her mother died, the thing she said was "Oh, damn."  And that they were all singers, they all--my mother's sisters all sang, all of them.  And remember, I said my great- story of my great-great-grandfather, they said was a great singer.  Like they said, like he must have been very important in his time.  And they were all in Savannah, Georgia.  She told me about my cousins, who I met a lot of them.  She told me about the slave quarters that they talked, told her about.  She told me also that they, the owners, the white owners, stole her father's land, and they were very bitter about it.  That forced them up to the North because their mother got very sick and she couldn't hold it together and she died.  So the sisters all got together and they came on a boat.  In those days, it was either a train or a boat.  They came on a boat, and the name of the boat was the Spirit of somebody--Spirit of Atlanta [sic.]?  Sp- I can't remember.  It was, they all came up.  That was her and--one, two, three, four sisters.  It was Aunt Bessie, Aunt Sarah [ph.], Aunt Shortie and her.  And they came up when she was a little girl, and they had to raise her because they had no--they actually came up cold.  I don't know if they knew anybody in New York [New York].  It sounds like they didn't.  They literally just--like a lot of people from the South who migrated to Chicago [Illinois], New York, Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], they just went; they had to get away.  And the impression that I got was that whatever happened with this land grab, it was pretty bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your mother came to New York.  How old was she when she came to New York?
Speaker 2: She was about eleven or twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my Aunt Shorty and the older ones raised her as their mother.  Because the mother said, "Take care of my baby," you know, before she, before she died.  "You girls take care of my baby, now."  And so they raised her, these wonderful women.  They were just--I'm talking super.  I don't know about anybody else's aunts, but these women had so much influence over me, I get a little teary-eyed.  They literally molded my life and gave me the things that I needed from a character basis.  I realize that now--because I hear them as if they're alive.  Like I hear them talking, "No, no, remember I said don't do that.  Don't go there, don't do that."  And I quote a lot of things they say, and I remember it.  So, I'm blessed that way, man.  They were--and that's as much as got.  There were other things that can't come to mind, but this trauma about their land being taken seems to be very strong in my mind when she told me.
Story_ID: 598053
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] and father [Thomas Gourdine] meet?
Speaker 2: Well, my father (unclear) from Charleston [South Carolina].  He moved to New York City [New York, New York] with his brother, Uncle George [ph.].  Why they moved, I don't know.  And they took their little sister, my Aunt Naomi [ph.] who I'd better call (laughter), birthday coming.  (Laughter) Anyway, they took her.  She was a little, the youngest of the children.  And how they did it, I'm not really sure.  It's complicated.  My great-grandfather was a rolling stone, so there're a lot of Gourdines in that (unclear) (laughter).  They're all over the place 'cause I found them.    And so I don't know how that worked, but they ended up in New York City.  And he was twenty years old, he's five years older than my mother.  And I guess he met her through my aunts, somehow somebody knew somebody.  I mean New York at that time--Harlem [New York, New York] was a small community at that time, and everybody knew everybody.  And she was fifteen years old when he met her, and he married her when she was sixteen.  They got married young in that day.  And they stayed married until my father passed away.  We celebrated their fiftieth anniversary in 1983.
Story_ID: 598054
Speaker 1: Now tell me about your siblings.  You have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about them.
Speaker 2: My brothers were another bunch of u- unique guys that I miss them very much.  All of my brothers have passed.  All of my immediate family is gone.  There's only two of us left of my immediate family, my cousin Paulette [ph.], and I talk to her on the phone all the time.  We stay, we've got to stay together; it's just us.  And, but my brothers--my brother Donald [Donald Gourdine (ph.)] died of, of--he was, he was, unfortunately, he got himself in trouble with drugs.  And he was next to me.  And he died.  He got clean, but he died from complications of diabetes.  He was a genius.  In fact, he was far more talented--he had more talent in his little pinky than I had in my whole career.  But it didn't happen that way for him.  He was so smart that in those days--black kids, they ain't supposed to be that smart, I guess.  And we find out later on that he had a tremendous IQ, very high.  And they didn't know in the public school system, and they didn't care, actually at that time about--. So, he couldn't--he was so ahead of them, as the story comes to me, that he couldn't catch up.  I mean they couldn't realize that, wait a minute, we should put this kid in another kind of a class.  Bump him up or do something, he's very smart.  Not with black kids, they didn't do that, you know.  And so he used to build things with his hands, and he built--once he built a house out of matchsticks and actually took it to a bank.  And I was in in Brooklyn [New York] not long ago, and saw that bank.  It's called the Brooklyn Dime and Savings Bank [sic. Dime Savings Bank of Brooklyn; Dime Savings Bank of New York].  And he actually sold them for a few dollars, which they turned and used, obviously, and made more money from it.  But he did it with matchsticks, and I actually remember him doing it as a kid.  He was brilliant.  That's Donald.  My other brother next to him, the middle brother, was Elliot Gourdine [ph.].  And Elliot was a musician, and Elliot was really good at playing drums, stuff like that.  Now, my brother Donald played every kind of instrument in the world, n- self- not taught.  And he actually composed a musical score in prison.  That's Donald.  Elliot was more home, more family orientated, more disciplined sort of young man.  He died of alcoholism because there seems to be a problem in our family, from a gene pool going back on my father's [Thomas Gourdine] side more than anybody else, of these problems.  And that's why I'm very aware of it because it's there, you know.  And he died and he was, he was really talented.  My brother, Sonny [ph.], was my half-brother.  His father was a lieu- lieutenant in the [U.S.] Army.  My mom [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] was his mom.  Somehow the story that I got was that my mom got in trouble, and so my father actually married my mother to, being noble, to get her legal, or whatever that might be.  But my brother Sonny and I were like this (gesture).  He was my half-brother, but I didn't know who he was.  I knew he was my brother.
Speaker 1: He was the oldest?
Speaker 2: He was the oldest, the wisest, the smartest, and I loved him until the day he left this earth in 1987.  He died of, he died of heart--he was very, very heavy.  But he didn't really--it was just a plain heart attack.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he also was a musician and played.  Everybody in my family, especially on my father's side were musicians, to this day.
Story_ID: 598055
Speaker 1: So when your mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] and father [Thomas Gourdine] got married, they settled in Harlem [New York, New York] first--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or did--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they lived at 140-something street and 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard]; I think 148th [Street] and 7th first.  And then they moved--(cough) excuse me--to 99- to 99th Street and Central Park West.  And they--that's where I was born, I was born, and that's where I lived.  Actually, people don't realize--I used to freak people out.  I can actually remember the house, the little doorway, and I was only two years old.  But I remember it to this day.  For some reason I remember.  And they say, "That's--yes."  I say, I remember the kitchen was over here, and the little doorway was over there, and I remembered all that stuff.  And they said, "That's right."  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, that's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember that as clear as a bell, to this day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so how long did your family live in Harlem?
Speaker 2: They lived there--I was born in '41 [1941].  Forty-two [1942], let me see, '41 [1941].  They said I was almost two years old before they moved to Brooklyn [New York].  And the reason why they moved to Brooklyn was because it was during the war, World War II [WWII], that there was all these jobs.  Remember, it was just out of, out of the Depression [Great Depression], so everybody needed a job.  And they needed workers at the Brooklyn Navy Yard [New York, New York] for the war effort.  And it happened that my father was a very good handyman.  He could do anything--electricity, anything.  He was just handy.  And he got a job rigging lights, electrical situations on the ships.  And one of the things he did when I was little, he took me to the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  I can remember that as clear as a bell.  He took me to the Missouri [USS Missouri], which is called the Iowa-class.  I'm a history buff.  It's called the Iowa-class.  It was the Missouri, the New Jersey [USS New Jersey], the Wisconsin [USS Wisconsin] and somebody else.  And these were the largest warships in the world at that time outside of the Yamato, which is what the Japanese have, and the Graf Spee [Admiral Graf Spee], and the Bismarck.  This was the largest--I was into this.  So he took me there once, and he took me all around the ship.  In fact, I'm taking my grandchild to see a few in June.  I'm going to Hawaii and I'm going to take them to see the Missouri, just like my dad took me around the ship.  So he worked in the Navy Yard, and that's what forced us there, he got this job.  And they put him in a housing place there, that at that time was governmental run, and it was very mixed.  There were Jews, Italians, you name it.  They were all there working in the Navy Yard.
Speaker 1: And so, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Before it became the projects (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was the name of the housing?
Speaker 2: The housing was called Fort Greene projects [Brooklyn, New York], which I found out they're turning them into condominiums.  So, interesting.  And, but that's where we lived.  And that is where my life really began, understanding where I--the streets that I ran, the friends that I knew and the things that happened to me, was there.  That was the beginning of it.
Speaker 1: Fort Greene projects, tell me where that is in Brooklyn.
Speaker 2: Fort Greene projects is right around--well, you got Hillary--Tillary Street--it's between Farragut projects [Farragut Houses, Brooklyn, New York], the Navy Yard, it's right next to the Navy Yard.  And that would be, oh, maybe about ten blocks from the Manhattan Bridge [New York, New York], where you begin to get on the Manhattan Bridge.  So it was right there, where the Brooklyn Navy Yard is today, it's there.  And so, that's how--and the East River was there.  We were kids, we played around that area there.  I was fool enough to jump in that nasty water.  But we didn't know no different.
Story_ID: 598056
Speaker 1: Tell me about the neighborhood.  Now, you alluded to the fact that it was very mixed in the projects (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It--totally.
Speaker 1: Tell me about who lived there.  Who were the, the storeowners?  And--
Speaker 2: I will tell you--
Speaker 1: --just tell me about the neighborhood, and how, your relationship and your family's relationship with the other people who lived there.
Speaker 2: There was a movie done many, many years ago.  And no one will remember, because it's too far to remember.  It was called 'Our Town.'  It was a 'Our Town.'  It was a drugstore, we knew everybody's names.  Where you get your ice cream, and in those days it was loose ice cream, and soda pop, and all that kind of stuff.  That's where you went.  And the drugstore was in there, everything was in that one place.  I can remember when we shopped, we shopped at--they used to have the fish market, there you go get your fish.  Then they had these carts, and they would come around on horse-driven carts.  And they'd go, "Get your fish, your fish," and blow a horn.  And people would run out and buy fresh fish.  Vegetables, everything was brought to you.  There was no supermarket at that time. When you'd go get chicken, you'd go to the chicken market, and they'd actually be alive.  And they would pick out the chicken.  (Laughter) And I remember my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] would take me every Saturday.   And they actually would slit the chicken's neck, if that's what you wanted, turn them upside down in this giant pot and bleed it.  And then they would have it plucked on a machine, and you'd have fresh chicken.  It wasn't until I--the first time I remember a supermarket, the name of that supermarket was called A and P [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company].  The next one came in, I must have been ten.  It was called Safeway, which is today.  So that's the only--and they're everywhere now.  And there was a place that we went as kids.  Me and one of the Imperials [Little Anthony and the Imperials], Clarence Collins, we were laughing about this the other day.  There was a candy store, it was called Sarjay's [Brooklyn, New York].  And we were laughing because I got caught stealing candy (laughter). They caught me and pulled my hand up, trying to get the candy, and they grabbed me.  And in those days it was 'Our Town,' it really was 'Our Town.'  The policemen--the name of the priest, his name was Father Termine [Vincent J. Termine].  I can remember, Father Termine.  Kelly [ph.] was the police officer that everybody knew, Officer Kelly, he was Irish.  There was, this little community was just a community that was run by the Navy Yard [Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York, New York].  And so, everything was kept.  We were very protective in this little community.  The school there was called P.S. 67 [P.S. 67, Charles A. Dorsey School, Brooklyn, New York], where I got some of the greatest influence in music in my life by a teacher who passed away many years ago, who was so influential to me that I think of her every day, and I thank God for her.  Her name was Ethel Mannix, she was a music teacher that helped catch the little talent she thought I had with my Aunt Bessie.  My Aunt Bessie was the first to figure it out.  But then they saw it, and they said, wait a minute, this kid's got something going.
Story_ID: 598057
Speaker 1: This was a, this was a place where, where we would go to other kids' houses.  And there would be Italian kids, where I learned about Italian food.  I like Italian food to this day because I used to go eat there.  No one--I didn't even know I was supposed to be black.  I didn't know what that was (laughter), until I heard somebody called me a name one day.  Now my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] took me to the bank, and the kid said, "All right nigger."  And I go, "Huh?" It bothered me, and I (unclear) I went, "What is that?"  I never knew it with my friends.  I actually have a picture today of this bunch in my room, it was preserved for me by a friend.  It says 1947, you see all of us standing there, all these little kids.  And I'll show it to you.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you remember some of your friends that lived in the projects?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, many of them.
Speaker 2: Who are they?
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh, Earl Washington [ph.].  Earl Washington and I went to school.  He's now big-time, he's a big-time bro- investment broker.  And he used to be the bully in the school.  I know Earl don't want me telling this.  And I used to be so scared of him (laughter).  We laugh about it now, but you know, it was kid stuff.  There was Earl, and then there was a kid called Howdy Doody [ph.].  There was so many of them.  One kid committed suicide.  It was--in fact, I once wrote a story, just fooling around, because I write and it comes naturally to me.  And I used to--called 'The Navy Street Gang' [ph.].  And I once--somebody told me, "Man, that's the cutest story I heard in my life," about this bunch of kids, all these little different races of kids running around the street like The Bowery Boys.  And they said, "You need to take that someplace."  I took it--I'm just going to say this.  I took it to Universal [Universal Studios; Universal Studios Hollywood] on a--because a friend asked me to take it to a particular guy.  And they took it, and the next thing I know a movie came out years later called 'Stand By Me.' And as I watched this movie, I'm going--it talked about the railroad tracks.  When we were kids, we'd--except in that movie it was the actual railroad tracks.  With us, it was the trolley tracks we used to play on on Navy Street [Brooklyn, New York], and the adventures that we had.  And I started going, oh, no, it can't be.  No, no, no.  But to this day, it always bothered me, I mean it just--and I never knew what happened to that little thing that I wrote, the synopsis.  And it was about these little kids, Jews, Italians, blacks.  Little kids who didn't know--they didn't know they ain't supposed to like each other, whatever that meant.  We just, we were--we were there.  And yeah, that time to me was wonderful.  I was, man, I ain't got no sad story there.  That, that's, that was good, that was real good.
Story_ID: 598058
Speaker 1: So tell me about elementary school.  You went to P.S. 67 [Charles A. Dorsey School, Brooklyn, New York]?
Speaker 2: P.S. 67--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --public school.  And I remember my teachers.  Mrs. Thompson [ph.], she was the only black teacher in the whole school at that time.  She was, Mrs. Thompson was a geo- geo- geography teacher.  Mr. Morley [ph.] was the--and (unclear) say Mr., Ms., you know, they do that in them days.  Today you have to bring a gun to school, but then it was cool.  But he was a physical education teacher.  He told my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] that I was like a little baby, I needed to be toughened up (laughter).  He said, "He's like Ferdinand the bull.  All he does is look out the window and sing and hum songs." (Laughter) "He's got to act like a man."  You know how that was.  And then there was Mrs. Crowley [ph.], and she was crabby Mrs. Crowley.  Then there was Mrs. Romeo [ph.], my third grade teacher, who really was the one that found out and told my mother and father [Thomas Gourdine], "This kid, for his age he's so hip to politics, knowing who is who."  She asked me well, who is the secretary, secretary of state at this time, and that was when President Truman [President Harry S. Truman] was in--.  And I said, "Dean Acheson."  No one would have known that, but I knew.  I know to this day, Dean Acheson.  And that's when she said, "He has a real want to know history.  For whatever reason he's like--well, the other kids don't care.  He does."
Story_ID: 598059
Speaker 1: Okay we were talking about elementary school [P.S. 67, Charles A. Dorsey School, Brooklyn, New York].  But outside activities--what about church?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, I went to everybody's church.  Actually, I remembered every Ash Wednesday I would always get jealous because all the kids would get to go out, the Catholic kids. (Laughter) They'd get the day off.  So one day I said, I want to do that, too, and I left and went to a Catholic s- church.  And you're supposed to have--all those things you have to do in Catholic church before you receive that.  Well, I lied.  I told them, "Okay, yes, I did that," just to get the ash so I could walk around and say, "Well, I can't go to school today because it's Ash Wednesday."  So, Father Termine [Vincent J. Termine] one day got me.  (Laughter) He said, "Look," you know, he was the father of the Saint Edwards Church [Church of Saint Michael-Saint Edward, Brooklyn, New York], Catholic church.  He said, "You kids have got to stop doing that stuff.  Why don't you just come to church?  We got all kinds of good stuff and activities."  So I went.  And I actually to school for a while, the Catholic school, for Communion.  But prior to that, that was just, I just needed an out.  You know, I'm just, I was hustling.  Prior to that, where I was raised in the church, it was a Baptist church.  Those sisters that I talked about came from Savannah, Georgia--Aunt Bessie, Aunt Shortie, Aunt Sarah [ph.].  And my Aunt Ellen [ph.] had died before I was born.  But those remained, and my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine].  They all went to church in New York City [New York, New York].  In those days there were a lot of storefront churches, they didn't have big churches.  I can't remember the street where it was on, but it was on 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] and 100-somebody street in Harlem [New York, New York], and it was called the Nazareth Baptist Church [ph.].  My mother and her sister sang there, and the name of their group was the Nazareth Baptist Singers [Nazareth Baptist Gospel Singers], gospel singers. Sh- they sang there for years.  So when I was kid, that was mandatory to go to church, that was mandatory (laughter).  Because I remember Sunday mornings--I'd go there in the morning and looked like the sun was down by the time I got out.  But they fed you (laughter), they kept you busy.  And that is where my Aunt Bessie began to realize--she said--well, the story goes that Aunt Bessie said that--oh, okay, I told you about the movie 'Soul Food,' where every Sunday they'd get together and then the reverend would be there.  Well, the Reverend was, my reverend was called Reverend Milton [ph.].  He was the reverend of that church, and I guess he saw that meal every Sunday, so he rolled in.  He sat at the prominent part of the table.  The little kids sat at their little table, not with grownups, they wouldn't sit with the grown people.  And all of my cousins and all of us--and just every Sunday that was what it was; that's what we did.  We'd go to Harlem, we'd get on the A train, we'd go from Brooklyn [New York], we'd have dinner there, which was great, because the food was outstanding (laughter).  And we would sit there, and Reverend Milton would sit there.  And that's what it was.  And so the time that I spent in that church was the beginning of my introduction to, to Jesus, to God, to Christianity, to where my character was molded from a spiritual standpoint as well as psychologically, or for that matter, physically being there in the physical person.  I was influenced by the preacher so much that I, I used to see in this Baptist church women falling out.  They used to have like nurses in there, literally.  They were wearing white, and they would pick them up because the Holy Ghost would hit them or something.  I don't know, I couldn't understand.  I said, "What is that?"  And they'd put smelling salt in their nose.  I said, wow, that's powerful, just some powerful stuff.  I was very young, but it influenced me.
Story_ID: 598060
Speaker 1: When my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] would sing with her sisters that influenced me.  I said, look at these people applauding and everything for them doing that.  Sh- I wish I could do that, maybe they would like me, you know, and I got involved.  And my Aunt Bessie, when we would have these Sunday things, it's the weirdest thing.  We'd have dinner, and then we would have blues or put on the blues or--at that time any blues s-.  And they would dance and laugh and have fun.  And I used to do what they called the shuffle, or something.  And everybody said, "Look at that boy, look at him dance.  Look at that boy."  And I'd be talking up a storm.  And my Aunt Bessie said, "That boy is either going to be a preacher, or he's going to be a performer, one of the two."  She took me under her wing and convinced the pastor--because she would have me talk.  My mouth was going--which is not hard for me--and she convinced him that she wanted me to sing a song because she heard me singing.  Well, as it goes, my mother said they started knowing I was singing when I was three years old because when I was in the hospital for a little back trouble or something I had as a kid, I would sing in the hospital.  And the nurses told my mother and my aunts, "Oh, that boy keeps all the kids up at night.  He keeps singing, and he sings this song 'Annie Get Your Gun.'"  And I didn't know all words.  I would say, "Lay that pistol down, lay, lay that pistol down, lay."  That's what they told me.  And so Aunt Bessie saw all this in the church, and started developing it, and she would encourage me to sing.  "Come on boy, sing.  Come on now, you know you can sing."  And she would give me little songs.  She gave me the first song I ever sang in church called 'God Is My Sunbeam' [ph.].  And I got to sing that in the church, and everybody went, "Oh."  I said, attention, attention, wow, I must be doing something.  And then they had me--they called it youth--the--we had a thing twice a year or once a year, when they'd have the youth do something special, like a play or whatever.  Well, this time they had the visiting preacher, you can be the preacher for that service.  So she said, "The way that boy talks, I know he's going to be a preacher."  Now she didn't give me anything to say.  And I remember her saying, "Boy, now you know you say your prayers.  Ask God what to say.  I don't tell you what to say."  I said, "Well, what am I supposed to do?"  "Just ask God, like you talk around here with your mouth going all night."  And I remember exactly what I said, "Faith is like, like a coin in a turnstile.  You got to have a coin to get on the subway before you get in" (laughter) something like that I remember.  Everybody went crazy.  And I'm saying, "What am I doing that makes people excited?"  And then with the combination of my mother singing, and my s- and my aunts and the music, and my father [Thomas Gourdine] was a jazz musician.  He was alto tenor sax player, and he played with lots of people.  He played a little bit with Count Basie, just to sit in.  He played with the Sinclair Orchestra.  He had his own band.  And so, my father used to take me with him to Savoy [Savoy Ballroom, New York, New York] and all these different places.  I met Duke Ellington when I had to be about eight years old.  I didn't know who Duke Ellington was, but now that I grew up, I said, "I met that guy" as a kid.  So the influence of my mother in the gospel area, where her sisters were more--they were very much more Christian bound than my father's side of the family was.  Though, on the side of my father, my Aunt Eleanor [Eleanor Gourdine] was a God-fearing woman.  But the rest of them, you know, they were like, whatever.  You know, they went through the motions.  But on my mother's side they were very, they were some praying ladies, man.  They were like, they, they always talked to me, always telling me that I was something more than just being--that this was this God.  And that's how that started, that relationship.  And the singing and all of that came together, what made me who I am today.

Speaker 1: Tell me about your relationship with your, with your mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did your mother, did she work outside the home?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Mama worked, she w- (laughter) she worked at the A and S, A and S store [Abraham and Straus, New York, New York].  And people don't know what the A and S is.  It's like Macy's or whatever them big s--
Speaker 1: Abraham and Straus.
Speaker 2: Abraham and Straus.  So, she used to--you know how you'd come in there, and they had the--in those days they had the elevator to go up and down, but they had somebody to run the elevator.  She did that, and she also was up in this information booth that was this high (gesture).  And she used to tell me--I'd come in in my dirty face after school with nowhere to go, and I'd run over there to bother her.  And she'd look down and she'd say, "Look at this dirty-faced little boy."  That was me (laughter).  So she--and that's what my mother did.  My mother also used to have these weekend house parties, card games. She made money from it, you know.  She would, she was, she--well, they called it the house or whatever it is, to make ends meet.  Well, you know, you had to.  Because after the war [World War II, WWII], all those jobs like my father [Thomas Gourdine] had at the Brooklyn Navy Yard [New York, New York] was gone.  So we ended up in a Greek place, in a place that did f- furs, and textile place.  And it was called the Galutans [ph.], and it was on 22nd [Street] and 8th Avenue, it's still there to this day, and it was a Greek building.  My father learned how to speak Greek, fluent Greek, by being there for forty years.
Speaker 1: What type of work did he do there?
Speaker 2: He was a maintenance man, a jack of all trades.  He fixed things, he ran the elevator, he did whatever was needed.  He must have been very important because he was there for forty-something years.  They wouldn't let him go.  I mean he had a job.  I mean--and my father would always tell me, "Man, you don't know what it's like, kid."  Then when we were growing up, he said, "You ain't never been through the Depression [Great Depression]," he would always say that all the time, "You don't know how this Depression was."  My dad wanted me to be a draftsman, a somebody, a lawyer, or something.  My mother understood from my aunts, he's show business.  We got to push him in that direction.  She pushed me one way, and he pushed me another.  My mother wanted to put me in Music and Art [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York], which would have been the right thing to do, because I would learned how to play piano and really enhance myself as a musician.  But my father wanted me to go to Boys High [Boys High School; Boys and Girls High School, Brooklyn, New York].  Now, here's the thing.  I never went to Music and Art.  There's a part of me that says I should have, to advance myself as an entertainer to play music.  But another part of me that had a wonderful life at Boys High, so much so that some of the friends are--we're still friends to this day.
Story_ID: 598062
Speaker 1: Where I'm going (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Before we get to high school, did you go from P.S. 67 [Charles A. Dorsey School, Brooklyn, New York] to a junior high school, or did you just go straight to high school?
Speaker 1: In those days, there were no junior highs.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You went straight from eighth grade to, I guess you call it junior high--the high school, whatever that was.
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: We called it freshman year, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They don't that much now.  Today they have junior high.
Speaker 2: Did you belong to any organizations like the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)]?  Or was there a community center?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Tell me about that.
Speaker 1: Compared to today, in those days there were several things that were, was a given: music classes, sports, gym and recreation centers.  In those days we were kids, we weren't really latchkey kids.  Because everybody knew everybody in that community, everybody looked out for everybody.  So we would go to the P.S. 67 every day. They had the gym.  They had basketball, we had--
Speaker 2: Ping pong?
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't ping pong.  It was that hockey thing you do on the table.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We had that, we had poison ball, what they call dodge ball.  We had just everything.  And that was in the winter, it was indoor.  And in the summertime we had baseball, we had Little League, we had all of that stuff.  That wasn't like it is today.  I mean, it's bad now.  But then, there was a sense of community.  And some wonderful people came out of that community.  They became giants in this business.  I can name them all, giants.
Speaker 2: As?
Speaker 1: Well, you had the King brothers who played for the Knicks [New York Knicks], Albert King and his brother [Bernard King].  And then you got commissioner, was the commissioner of the NBA [National Basketball Association], Simon Gourdine.  We don't know if we were connected or anything like that, but we always wondered if we were connected (unclear).  And, oh my gosh, my brain went blank.  Who came out of that neighborhood?  There were really influential people that came out of that neighborhood.  Oh, gosh, my mind doesn't click right now.  But fr- but they used to say, like a lot of the places in New York City [New York, New York], you either become a priest, a thug, or you go to show business, you know.  So, it was either or.  We had some people who didn't make it, you know what I mean.  But mostly, a lot of them who came out of there were quite influential.  In fact, the most influential people I've ever seen in my life, that I know to this day, came out of Boys High [Boys High School; Boys and Girls High School, Brooklyn, New York].  I came up with Connie Hawkins.  The great Connie Hawkins was just leaving, I got to meet him.  And Tommy Davis of the Dodgers [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers], Richie Havens, the singer.  Oh my goodness, Irwin Zucker, became big producer.  Man, there were some powerful people who came out of there, I mean really, really big.  That school turned out some really good--especially black folks, man, it did.  That's, it's called Boys, Boys and Girls High School now, they moved it.  But it was Boys High School at that time.
Story_ID: 598063
Speaker 1: Tell me about your experien- your personal experience there at Boys High [Boys High School; Boys and Girls High School, Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 2: Man, I had so many.  I came in, went to a place called the annex as a little boy.  I was only fourteen years old, scared to death.  I didn't know--you know, it was just a big jump for me.  I mean they gave me a pass to go on the bus.  My whole life at fourteen, my whole life had always been in one area.  I walked to school.  So, now I'm told I got to take a bus and a train to way over on the other side of Brooklyn [New York].  That was rough, you know.  I was a very sensitive child, introvert.  The only time I'd express myself was musically.  Then it would all come out, while I was telling jokes or doing something.  But then when it was over, I always got that feeling I'm not good enough.  And for whatever reason that is, I'm not sure.  Maybe a good psychiatrist could tell you.  But I didn't know, and I used music as a form, a way of expressing myself.  And when I went to Boys High School, it was like I was a boy amongst men.  I mean, there were all these guys who were street smart.  And I'm going--. And it was pretty rough until one person here, and one person there, who would kind of bring you in and like you, whatever it is.  And if they were popular, you know, they don't mess with you, you know.  In fact that's how I started getting involved with gangs.  Boys High was great, but there were these gang problems in those days, not like today.  They didn't know what they were doing.  There were no drive by shootings and all that kind of crap.  It was more fighting and carrying on.  But there were gangs.  And so when I went to Boys High, what I found out was that this singing stuff worked there, too.  Because when--I didn't, I couldn't connect.  And they used to have a--we had--and they don't do that much anymore--lunch period.  They actually had a place you'd go eat lunch in the lunchroom, food.  And I think they'd charge you ten cents a plate or something like that (unclear), and you'd get a variety of food every day.  It was pretty good, I thought, you're hungry and you're a kid.  And they used to have a thing where when the food--you had forty-five minutes.  So if you finished your food in a half hour, there was maybe twenty minutes left, or whatever maybe left, and that was your time.  So the kids would do different things, laugh and talk to each other.  And kids would sing, or whatever they do, like singing groups.  And I said, hm.  So I did a duet with another guy, I can't even remember his name, it's been so long ago.  We did a thing like the Everly Brothers did, called (singing).  I don't know, we did it, and everybody was listening went, "Oh, man."
Story_ID: 598064
Speaker 1: A kid came to me by the name of William Dockerty.  He said, "Man, I'm putting this group together, man.  Can you sing harmony?"  "Yeah--," I learned it in church.  I learned how to sing harmony with my cousins, you know, we'd sing gospel.  "Yeah."  "I'm putting this group together."  And that group was called the Duponts.  Those were the experiences I had in school that actually started my life.  And we actually fooled around and fooled around, and got a record contract.  And we--the first record I ever made was on a company called Winley Records, Paul Winley [Paul Winley Records, Inc.].  And the name of that song was 'You,' Y-O-U, that somebody wrote.  It wasn't me because I really wasn't writing then.  And that's, that was a local hit.  And then I realized people really like you when they heard you on the radio a little bit, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you were in high school [Boys High School; Boys and Girls High School, Brooklyn, New York] during that time?
Speaker 1: I was in high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Very young.  From that, I met Tommy Davis, who at that time was a big star on the baseball team.  He came in the lunchroom, and him and a guy named William Buxton [ph.].  And they said, "Man, we going to put a group together."  And Tommy--all the kids were laughing.  But at that time Tommy was, Tommy was--you could see he was going to be a great ball s- a great star, and he became a great star for the Brooklyn Do- first, he was with the Brooklyn Dodgers.  He was drafted by the Brooklyn Dodgers, then the Los Angeles Dodgers was where he won the World Series ring and all that.  I know--haven't talked to him in a while, but yeah, I know Tommy.  And I met him.  And then Richie Havens came in one day.  And Richie was playing guitar.  Nobody was playing guitar.  So that was cool.  And he was doing, at the time he was doing folk music, I mean folk music.  Why?  And he was black, too.  I said, "What the heck is that?"  We all were singing R and B.  I said, what the heck is that?  But he had a guitar, and we needed that guitar.  And I laugh about that with Richie sometimes when I run into him.  And he became a big '60s [1960s] star.  And that intermingling, and the band, and the good and the gangs, and the good, and all that was happening at one time.  Thank goodness--well, actually what happened was I got involved so bad in gangs, I got myself in trouble sometime.
Speaker 2: What was, was there a name for the gang (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The name of the gang was the Chaplains.  Anybody from New York [New York] would remember that group, it was a notorious gang.
Speaker 2: The Chaplains?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And then it was the Bishops, and Uptown and all that.  And I would always try to be smart and not get myself to a point--. What I found out was, I'd get myself out of trouble by singing.  So, even my enemies liked me if I could sing good (laughter).  I'd find a way out.  And that all was going down.  And what happened was when I was with the Duponts, we did this little thing.  A company by the name of Royal Roost [Roost Records] was a big jazz company.  And there were these people that were involved in this company, which there was a book written about them called 'The Boys' [ph.] that started this whole thing.  This started this whole rock and roll thing.  And through them, they were associated with, with Alan Freed.  So they needed an opening act, and they had none.  And all they needed was to sing one song.  And they song we sang was called 'Prove it Tonight.'  It was the second song we made for Royal Roost.  We left Winley because that was not working.  And we went there and we sang, 'Prove it Tonight,' and we were at the New York Paramount [Paramount Theatre, New York, New York].  And that was the beginning of my ca- as, I didn't know at the time, but that was the launching pad.  I loved everything that was going on, but I didn't take it seriously.  I thought it was a great place to get with girls and all that and stuff, you know.  I--you know, when I sing, things happen.
Story_ID: 598065
Speaker 1: Well tell me about the gangs before we go on to the music career (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, the gangs.
Speaker 1: You said you got yourself in some trouble?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh man, yeah.  I mean s- they had two cops in Brooklyn [New York] called the Payne brothers [Carl Payne and Neville Payne].  And the Payne brothers were the most notorious cops in the world.  They had their mission to beat up every gang member they found.  And my brother, actually my older brother Sonny [ph.] started the gang.  It was named the Royals [ph.], the Royales [ph.].  And it was a social club at the time; it wasn't really meant to be anything other than a social club.  But it evolved, and then it became the Chaplains.  And then a lot of gangs started happening, and a lot of bad things starting happening, people started getting killed.  Not at the rate they're doing today; nowhere near this.  But still, it was really bad, I mean for us at that time.  And I remember Clarence, when I left, Clarence Collins, one of the Imperials [Little Anthony and the Imperials]--we were all raised together.  And he said that my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] used to tell him, "Boy, look after, look after Anthony [HistoryMaker Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine].  Because you know, he--."  He said, "Well, look after him?  He's older than me."  And I remember one day he hollered out the window, "Hey, man, come on, man.  We're going down."  We used to call it going down.  And my mother said, "If you going down, you're going to go over my dead body."  (Laughter) I couldn't get out the house.  I cried.  "They going to call me a punk.  Oh no."  (Unclear) I just wanted to be with the boys; you don't know.  That night, some of them were arrested.  Clarence was arrested by the Payne brothers.  And boy, they didn't--in those days there wasn't no political correctness.  They beat the living crap out of them (laughter).  They still remember that beating (laughter).  They could beat you, and you didn't even have any marks on you.  I don't know how they did it, but they did.  And I got out of that, and realized that one of the friends we had got killed.  And I think that hit me, like wham.  It hit Clarence, and we said, "This ain't--no."  So we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He got killed by getting beat up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that same fight.  Yeah, something happened.  He got hit with a bat and it crushed his skull.  And the night prior to that--a few days later I'm looking up in my window at 146 North Elliott Walk, facing my school [P.S. 67, Charles A. Dorsey School, Brooklyn, New York], I was right across the street from the school, and there was a gang thing.  And my mother, again, shut that door, boy, and threw her arms up, "Boy, you ain't going out of here."  And I saw out of my window, a guy that I knew take a garbage can and killed another man with a garbage can top.  Now, in those days you couldn't--if you ratted, oh, you just might as well move out of the country.  I just stood there like everybody else.  I saw it happen.  And in those days, it was two Italian cops--Italian sailors--(unclear) big to-do back then around 1954, two Italian sailors.  It was big news in New York [New York], all over the--were killed by gang members, some of the gang members I knew.  They killed them; they took their money and they robbed them.  And they asked Saint Edwards Church [Church of Saint Michael-Saint Edward, Brooklyn, New York] to go do--they were Catholics.  They were just, they were off the ships from the Brooklyn Yard [Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York, New York].  That's, you know, they were visiting.  They go and get robbed, and we knew who it was.  And I knew then, you know, I can't do this.  This is not going to be.  This ain't going.  Thank God I had enough sense and good people around me--my mother and my aunts all beating me in the head--that I realized that this, not, not for me, not for me.  And that was it.
Story_ID: 598066
Speaker 1: The group was called the Duponts.  How did you come up with that name?
Speaker 2: William Dockerty, he couldn't think of a name.  We started singing--doing little bitty little contests around town in those days.  You know, in those days we could fail, today kids can't.  We used to go to these here schools and, you know, you go to the auditorium and have these contests--the battle of the groups, all this kind of stuff.  And we had to come with a name.  And I don't know where William, Doc got that name, but I hated it.  I said, "Dupont, ain't that some kind of electrical company?"  (Laughter) He--legend says, he saw it on, something on TV that said--Dupont commercial--Dupont chemicals [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company] or whatever, and he said, "Oh, Dupont."  That's how--I never liked that name.  I hated that name, to this day.  But that's how it came about.
Speaker 1: So your, your first performance, was this--Star Time Studios [New York, New York], when was that?
Speaker 2: Star Time Studios was--my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine], again, she knew, like my aunts and them knew, as opposed to my father [Thomas Gourdine].  My father didn't want me to go through what he went through as a musician.  He felt it was a dead end.  He just felt it was a dead end, and if you don't get education--and he was right in that respect.  But he kind of didn't really see the big picture that I wasn't really cut out for that.  What I was cut out for, was what my aunts and my mother saw, and that was to sing.
Speaker 1: So Star Time was--
Speaker 2: So my mother would--there was a kid on television, the first black kid we'd ever seen.  It was called 'Star Time Studio' [ph.], it was every Saturday, just like you see 'American Idol,' they used to have that kind of show.  Like it was a, it was, it was something like 'Major Bowes' ['Major Bowes Amateur Hour'] that we used to have in those days.  You know, they used to have 'Star Time Studio,' and on that--Star Time Studios, they actually had these studios where you could go and join and learn a dance or play musical instruments and stuff.  They had this kid called Sugar Chile, Sugar Chile Robinson.  Now, you had to be much older to remember Sugar Chile Robinson.  Sugar Chile Robinson was big, just like Michael Jackson.  At his time, he was the biggest thing that had blown up at that time because he was on TV and he was a little kid, and he could play and dance, and all this stuff.  And he could sing, and oh, everybody went crazy.  He was called Sugar Chile Robinson.  And my mother wanted that, so she signed me up to the Star Time Stu- Studios, and there is where I actually learned pop music.  Because everything was blues.  Everything was--what I was raised up with, man, you know, 'Help Me Somebody,' The Royales [The "5" Royales], and The Ink Spots, and who else?  The Robins, and The Orioles, and all these groups at that time--Ravens [The Ravens].  I was influenced by the blues singers, [HistoryMaker] B. B. King, and all them cats were singing that stuff, man, and we wanted to be like them, you know.  But she sent me to this, and what they did was give me some culture.  I starting singing show tunes, and--ew.  But I guess what?  I got the hang of it.  It opened my head up a little bit more.  Look at that other thing. They were the ones that encouraged my mother to take me to Broadway shows.  And she did.  She didn't have a lot of money, but she found a way for us to get in there.
Story_ID: 598067
Speaker 1: Tell me who were the members of the original group, of the Duponts?
Speaker 2: Well, it was William Bracy, William De- William Delk--a lot of Williams in that group.  You know, I think it was William Dockerty, but I'm not sure.  It was Doc, Dockerty, Delk and Bracy.  Bracy just died--not just died--he died six years ago.  He was in the Vietnam War and he got wounded, and it played with his head, and he never was the same again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Doc, I don't to this day know whether he's alive or dead.  I've not seen him in fifty years, or forty-something years, I don't (unclear).  Delk I saw--he came to see me do a show in 1989 in New York City [New York, New York], he came with his wife.  He was doing very well.

Speaker 1: So there were other musical groups in New York City [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) who had recorded.  So you knew that it was a possibility that your group would be successful.
Speaker 2: Abso- absolutely.  And in this respect, it's a lot like the rappers are today.  Because that's where they--they're urban kids, they come out of that.  And that's what's influencing these kids today.  It's a little different than it was then.  In those days, it was singing groups.  Those days it was set by The Ink Spots, The Ravens, The Orioles, and people like that, Flamingos [The Flamingos].  They really influenced all these kids--The El Dorados.  And we--every--it's like every place had a singing group.  And I, mine's really was, like I said, in Boys High [Boys High School; Boys and Girls High School, Brooklyn, New York].  I got together with them and created a thing called the Duponts, and we were pretty good.  We won a lot of prizes and we won a lot of stuff.  But we ended up with Paul Winley.  And Winley was, we didn't know--he said, "I got a label called Winley [Paul Winley Records, Inc.]."  And we said, "Winley?"  We never heard of him.  But he did record us, and he did it very cheaply.  He went into his own pocket, he didn't take much.  Because we didn't get any royalties.  (Laughter) If there was royalties, we didn't get it.  So Paul, we were his first clients.  He went on to do some good things.  And that's how that was.  But then I got disillusioned--not so much disillusioned, as I was turned on by Clarence Collins.  Now Clarence was the founder of The Chesters, which became the Imperials [Little Anthony and the Imperials].  Clarence had a group called The Chesters, and we used to do contests, a lot of contests in certain places, schools.  And we were the king of the roost; we would just knock them down.  We'd win every time.  When I'd walk--, "Ah, we're going to win." And we, and we always did--we weren't smart enough to change our material.  We kept winning with this song called 'You' by, by The Moonglows; they had that big record at that time.  We were knocking them down with 'You.'  But then this little group comes along called The Chesters, they were in the same group.  And I heard them rehearsing, and I remember passing the room they were rehearsing in, and I said--I heard the harmony and how tight they were, and how disciplined they were.  And I said, oh my goodness, we got a problem.  So we went out, and I sang.  And they won, the first time.  I was, I'm like I'm used to winning (laughter).  I'm not used to losing.  And they won.  And Clarence and I knew each other since we were little kids.  We played in the mud together, seven or eight years old.  And he would always tell me, "Oh, I'm going to have a singing group someday."
Speaker 1: Did you all go to the same high school?
Speaker 2: We went to the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He went to Boys High School?
Speaker 2: --everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, we couldn't--we're still stuck (laughter).
Story_ID: 598069
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other groups around town, or--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Because this is about 1955?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jimmy Hicks [ph.], man.  Jimmy Hicks is one of the greatest bass singers I've ever heard.  The Velours, oh my gosh, they have one of the greatest bass singers on this--Ji- what was his name, not--they were from New York [New York].  Oh, there were some goodies that came out of there.  I met a guy the other day, and he was with one of the groups that really influenced me, and I can't remember their name.  But there was so many of them.  So the influence was so strong, you know, to be--like I said, these kids--it's the same thing, to be that--every kid want to be a rapper.  Well, then, every kid wanted to be in a group.  And once I heard Clarence's [Clarence Collins] group, I put in my back of my head, I said, I sure wish I was with a group like that. (Unclear) what I gotta do.  And that was prior, before I went to New York Paramount [Paramount Theatre, New York, New York].  It was the opening show with Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers and The Platters.  We opened with the big boys.  And in fact that's where I met Teddy Randazzo years before he became one of the most influential people in my life, and I wanted to be with them.  At the time, Clarence was running around trying to find a record deal, you could do it in those days.  You could run and get the subway and run over to a building called 1650 Broadway.  And that's where all the independent record companies was in America, in that one building.  And the Brill Building [New York, New York], you've heard about the Brill Building at 1619 Broadway where all the publishers were.  See, we knew where they were, and we used to go there and they'd--kids would audition.  You know, they would just let you sing, literally.  And he used to go over there and he found this guy that had a group called The Chantels.  This is '56 [1956] now.  And they were doing great.  I mean, they international.  They were getting like--they were The Supremes of their time.  "I know this guy, man.  I know the guy, I know the guy." He kept telling me.  He said, "I tell you, I know this guy."  And I said, "Man, I'm with the Duponts, man, I got a gig."  He said, "But, but--."  He went off.  And Clarence will tell you the story, he's done it on other interviews.  He went off--that's how I get it--he went off and saw him.  This is 1957, and they sang, and they loved the group.  But they said, "You got to get a leader.  You know, Ernest [Ernest Wright, Jr.] is not--it doesn't--you need--if you guys can find somebody that is actually a lead voice, you know, and able to carry that, come back."  So Clarence said, "I know a guy."  (Laughter) So he came to me and said, "Man, we got a chance, man.  If you can go over there and sing this song, man, that Cl- Ernest wrote, we can go over there and we can get this deal."  And I'm saying, "Well, we can't get a (unclear) with Dupont."  The magic word was a deal.  Record deal?  Goodbye, Duponts.  Hello, Chesters [The Chesters; Little Anthony and the Imperials] (laughter).  That actually broke the heart of Doc [William Dockerty].  Doc went--some say he got a nervous breakdown because of it.  True.  That's, that's legend, or I heard it.  But I never saw Doc again, to this day, never again.
Story_ID: 598070
Speaker 1: You recorded some, a few records with the Duponts (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, I did 'You,' 'Prove It Tonight.'
Speaker 1: 'You,' right, okay.
Speaker 2: Couple other things.  But it wasn't until I got with The Chesters [Little Anthony and the Imperials] that I started--I used to have to take a train, the A train, to my aunts all the time.  And I loved the ground to--I mean they--I loved to be with them, they were fun.  We went boat riding--
Speaker 1: The Chesters?
Speaker 2: No, my aunts.
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 2: They would take me on boat rides.  They were just fun people, they always were active. You know, they always wanted to do something.  We'd go to Coney Island [New York, New York], we'd go to this park, that one, you know.  Like, but they are like--I love these people, they are fun.  So I would always go up there, even as a teenager, and hang, not knowing what was going to go down that weekend.  And as I would go back and forth, I wrote a song, because I was bored on the A train.  And I called it 'Traveling Stranger,' which I have (unclear) to this day--a collector's item.  And I wrote this song, and I went back and told Clarence [Clarence Collins] about it, and so we started rehearsing it.  And then he said, "Look, Ernest [Ernest Wright, Jr.] got a song called 'Just Two Kinds of People in the World' ['Two People in the World']."  He says, he says, "Man, listen to it, and maybe you can put something to it."  And I did, I put this tenor part to it.  And he said, "This guy's going to tell you--if we can bring you with us, he'll give us a contract."  And they did; they brought me over there, and that's where I met Mr. Goldner, Mr. George Goldner, the head of End [End Records], Gone Records, who had The Isley Brothers.  He had The Dubs, he had The Chantels, he had them all.  He was the [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy of the city at that time.  And we went over, and I got to see a man by the name of Richard Barrett, who was the A and R [artists and repertoire] man there.  He's an historian himself.  He's in the--they've got pictures in the--what's the name of the institute?  Washington [D.C.]--of all these original people, it's in the, in the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution].  Yeah, actual picture.  Hundreds of them still alive.  They took a giant picture, and it was in the Smithsonian.  Anyway, he's a story in itself.  He wrote a book, actually.  Well, he, I met him and he said, "Richard, this is the guy."  And we started singing, and Richard said, "Hold it, hold it, hold it."  He got on, picked up his phone and he called George Goldner in the other office and he said, "You got to come and hear this."  And George Goldner came in, and he says, "Richie, Richie, Richie, who are these kids?"  He says, "The same guys who were here last year.  But they came back with this kid with this high voice."  Well, he, his baby at that time was Frankie Lymon, Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers.  So he needed--Frankie was all messed up with drugs and stuff.  And they needed somebody, you know, to--new because he was just messed up.  And I knew Frankie from way back. That's another story.  But then I went in there, and that's how we got the deal.  And, and, and, and, and that's when it all, it just blew up.  It just blew up.
Story_ID: 598071
Speaker 1: So tell me all the members of, of The Chesters [Little Anthony and the Imperials].
Speaker 2: The Chesters at that time was Tracy Lord, Nathaniel Rodgers, and of course--those guys left in 1960.  One was drafted in the [U.S.] Army, the other one just didn't want to sing anymore.  You know, he got dis- whatever, disillusioned.  So then that leaves us.  And who was together there?  Ernest Wright [Ernest Wright, Jr.], Clarence Collins and myself.  Sammy Strain came in 1962.  Remember, he was with The O'Jays for sixteen years.  He was with us originally, came back with us.  I can show you the pictures.  Came back with us, but then again he retired left.  But he already (unclear) The O'Jays--and he had two successes, two successful worlds.  He lived in both worlds.  Me and [HistoryMaker] Eddie Levert talk about that to this day. To this day we talk about that.  He said, "I don't understand how he did that."  (Laughter) He did.
Speaker 1: And these were all guys from the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Sammy was from Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York] that Clarence had met.  And Kenny Seymour, who used to be our musical director, all these guys found him.  And Harold Jenkins, who's with us now, was our choreographer back as far as 1962.  He now sings with us.  So Ernest, myself, and Clarence are the original of the original.
Story_ID: 598072
Speaker 1: So now you graduate from high school, you're doing all of this.  And--
Speaker 2: Now that's a story.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me your (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.  Remember, I told you I fooled around with these gangs?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I can't remember exactly, but I know it was in the main building.  This had to be '57 [1957], yeah, in the middle of '57 [1957], almost the end of '57 [1957].  I went off, running with them kids, man, and you know, hanging with them boys.  They were smoking that dope and everything thing else that they turned me on to.  And I, it felt funny.  I, I, I, I didn't go back to school.  I would--I hung out of school for sixty-something days.  Now all this time I'm making--my mother's [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] making me--you know, whatever, getting me ready for school.  I'd get on that train and head just for (unclear) project, for my buddies to hang, do nothing, smoke cigarettes, Pall Malls.  I'd hang around with (unclear) little girls who was doing the same thing we were doing--up to no good, you know.  And finally a smart teacher in high school found out about this, and said, something's wrong here.  My mother never knew about it.  But when they found out, when my mother found out about it (laughter), they took me to school.  They were disciplinarians in those days.  They don't do that much anymore.  They had a lot of influence, the teachers.  The parents were, they worked together in those days.  I mean, it was a double nemesis, you couldn't get around it.  And they sat there and they told them, "Look, there's only one thing that boy can do to get his studies up so he can graduate with his class."  They said, "And the only way he can do it is go to summer school."  I said, "Summer school?" (Laughter) You know that's what (unclear). "I don't want to go to summer school."  My mother said, "You going to summer school."  My brother said, "You're going to summer school."  My father [Thomas Gourdine] said, "You're going to summer school."  My aunt said, "You're going to summer school."
Speaker 1: So you went to summer school?
Speaker 2: I went to summer school.  I was miserable.  It was hot.  There was no air conditioning.  I was in the eastern district, another school that they used.  I had to take all these trains to get there, and I used to go, "This--(unclear) having fun this summer, man.  I miss going to the beach, I'm not going to Coney Island [New York, New York]."  And I actually--at that time, remember I told you we had ju- The Chesters [Little Anthony and the Imperials] just were given a contract because of 'Just Two Kind of People' ['Two People in the World'] and we were singing it.  And another song they gave us was called 'Tears on My Pillow.'  And I didn't like it, and George [George Goldner] told me to sing it.  And--he was the head of the company [End Records], and he said, "Look, sing it like you talk.  You talk with a high voice.  Do that."  And he said, "Who's your favorite singer?"  I said "Nat Cole [Nat King Cole]."  "Well, do--enunciate like he does.  You know, make it clear."  And he created me.  And not knowing--they were all excited.  I didn't think about that; I had to go to summer school.  I was in summer school (laughter), and I'm miserable.  And in those days, kids used to bring transistors to school.  And when they--nobody would look, you know, or they had a little break or something, they'd listen to their little music in their (gesture).  And there was a show called Dr. Jive, Tommy Smalls, or something like that.  Yeah, Dr. Jive was big, R and B, and they were killing that record.  So a little girl was singing, she was going, "Tears on my pillow," she was just singing on that.  And I sat up in the chair going, "Tears on my pillow?" I said, "Excuse me, can I hear that?"  It was me.  When I heard that, I said, "Excuse me, I'm leaving."  (Laughter) School was out.  I'm in show business.  I'll be a star.  I was gone, left.  Never picked up my diploma.  In fact, it was the final test.  I took the test, I wasn't sure I passed.  Found out years later I passed.  And I got a diploma, to this day, it's in Boys High School [Boys and Girls High School, Brooklyn, New York].  They asked me to come and get it; they want to honor me, the stories of all my buddies.  They said, "Man, you got, you got a diploma."  I didn't want no diploma, I was in show business.
Story_ID: 598073
Speaker 1: You know, and Clarence [Clarence Collins] told me--he was working the meat market for this guy, and cutting beef, and cutting beef, bored to death.  And when he heard the song ['Tears on My Pillow'] come over the radio he was listening, he said, "That's me."  (Laughter) He said he took his apron off, "Goodbye."  (Laughter) He left.  We were gone.  We--that was it, it just blew--we didn't in our wildest dreams ever think anything can be that be that big, I mean, for anybody.  I mean we became, it was like, there's something really special here.  This song was being played everywhere, all over the world, to the point that Alan Freed started really doing stuff.  We started getting all these--we were the first black group to ever be on a thing called 'Hit Parade' ['Your Hit Parade'] on television--the only, the first black group ever allowed--R and B group ever let on the 'Hit Parade.'  We broke so many things.  We were the first black group that ever sang on 'Today Show' ['Today'] back in the day, the same 'Today Show' you see on NBC in the beginning with Dave Garroway, and what's the name of the girl, the lady now?  She's an icon now.  What's her name?  Whoever, she always interviews all these big diplomats and people of the world.  She got this thing called 'The View.'  What's her name?
Speaker 2: Barbara Walters.
Speaker 1: Barbara Walters was the first interview.  And she didn't even know how to interview us, she didn't know what to ask.  And I heard her say, "I don't even know that--."  They said, "Well, just ask them this and that."  We were the first to ever be, do that show live, that they do often now.  We were the first to do everything.  We were the only, we were the only ones like our kind.  What it was, was the song 'Tears on My Pillow' wasn't particularly an R and B song; it was a crossover song.  We didn't know what a crossover meant.  To the rest of white America and everybody--(unclear) they must be all right to sing this.  And we just crossed over and we became not just an R and B act, we became a pop R and B act, and we got blown up.  And it was like going from nobody to somebody overnight, and that was rough.  That was a trip that we had to learn trial and error.  We couldn't handle it, it was just too much.
Speaker 2: So what was it that you couldn't handle?
Speaker 1: It was just everything.  We didn't understand.  We didn't know we should have got theatrical lawyers who should be in there; we were getting real estate lawyers.  Our parents didn't understand.  They didn't know, they were laborers.  We were getting all the wrong people to run our business.  And one of the mistakes that was made--actually it was a young kid who was a stock boy, who was writing, trying to get himself going.  And he wrote a song for me.  And he told Mr. Goldner [George Goldner], "I wrote this song for Anthony [HistoryMaker Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine].  I love his voice."  And that song was called 'The Diary,' that was Neil Sedaka.  They--Richard Barrett didn't particularly like the song, so when George was out of town, he changed it and put on his song, 'So Much,' until that song became for that boy--when they found out it wasn't going to be released by me--I mean, us singing it, he just gave it to some other company.  And then he said, "Well, why don't you record it?"  And it launched his career.  So when I do talk to Neil, he says, "Hey, look at it this way.  I would have never been in show business (unclear) unless you turned my song (unclear). I mean everything worked out."  You know, it was 'The Diary.'  It was one mistake after another, one mistake--you know, like it was--it just didn't, we just didn't have what we needed, you know.  We'd like to think that [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy and everybody else, to this day--Beyonce and all of them--learned what not to do through us.  These kids today, they come in with their lawyers; they're already set up with their corporations.  We didn't know nothing about c- we didn't know what a corporation was.  We didn't know the tax problems and liabilities.  We didn't, we didn't s- all we knew is we were on the--I never flew in my life.  I flew on my first plane in 1958 to Boston [Massachusetts], I took my father [Thomas Gourdine].  We both never flew in our lives.  He was so proud.  We went flying. I mean we were in Hawaii.  We were the first black singing group with Sam Cooke to go to Hawaii.  We were the first group--we were the first for everything, to take a jet, the first, the first 707 jet, commercial airline.  We were on that jet, and Ed Sullivan was on that jet.  And that was from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to New York [New York], the first commercial jet, we were on it.  We were--I was--the next thing you know, "You're going to write a song with Sam Cooke."  I knew Sam.  Sam used to go to my mo- my aunt's house, because in those days the gospel singers didn't have no place to stay.  I mean, they couldn't stay in the white hotels, so they stayed in guest houses.  So she, he called Ms. Ford, that was my aunt.  Sarah Ford [ph.] was her name, Ms. Ford, and that's how I met him when he was young.  He was with The Soul Stirrers.  He knew me, and once he figured out it was me, then they called me and said, "Man, Sam said,"   he said, "They wanted Sam to come over and hear your song."  Because he had just made 'You Send Me.' He saw me on the stage doing 'I'm Alright,' we were at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York].  We went downstairs in the basement and worked on a song called 'I'm Alright.'  I get residuals from that song to this day (laughter).  It just--so much happened so quickly.  The next thing I know, I'm next to Moms Mabley, I'm with Redd Foxx, I'm with people that I just--you know, I'm dumbfounded, man--Little Willie John.  I'm going--you know, Little Willie went on stage.  We were at the Royal Theatre in Baltimore [Maryland].  And he said, "Hold my gun, man, while I go on."  (Laughter) He gave me a .38 to hold for him.  I mean I'm dumbfounded, I don't know--I meet Pearl Bailey, I'm going, "Is that that woman I see in the movies?"  You know, it was like over and over.  I was pushed from one world, one moment, into this world that I wasn't psychologically prepared for, or was my group.  We were just Brooklyn [New York] street kids.  We learned on the job, by trial and error.
Story_ID: 598074
Speaker 1: What was the name of the label that you were with at this time?
Speaker 2: The label was called End Records.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how long did you stay with End Records?
Speaker 2: Two and a half, maybe three years.  Then he s- George Goldner sold out to Roulette Records to Morris Levy.  He sold all of his companies: Gone Records, Kico [sic. Tico Records], which is a (unclear) Latin company.  He sold it all to Morris Levy.  And then we, things got really bad and we start, you know, we just, we just had no emotional understanding.  We were just kids.  We were like not strong enough, not educated enough to be able to direct our destiny.  Couldn't do it.  And so, fate was that we were headed for a crash (gesture).
Speaker 1: Tell me who The Cellos were?
Speaker 2: I don't know who--The Cellos, the group?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I don't remember that name.
Speaker 1: Was that a group that introduced you to the Apollo record label, Apollo Records?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It was, I think it was the--oh, man, Bobby, his name was Cox [ph.].  He was with a group called--(singing), "Oh, little girl--."  They were big hit.  And we met them one day, and I think they were the ones, but I don't think it was The Cellos.  That word does ring a bell, but I'm not sure where.  But they were, they were the ones that introduced us to Sa- what's his name?  Saperstein [sic.], whatever his name was, I can't remember.  Anyway, he was the president.  And at that time, that was when we were The Chesters, actually.  That wasn't the Imperials [Little Anthony and the Imperials] yet.  We had not gone to End Records and met Richard Barrett or any of these people, and George Goldner at the time.  We were still The Chesters, and we did a thing called 'The Fires Burn No More,' that was another song that I wrote.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you said that you were destined for a crash.  What happened?
Speaker 2: Just constant crashing.  We just didn't--we learned on the job.  I mean, you're taking a boy and you're throwing him into a man's world.  My teachers in the world was LaVern Baker.  My teachers were Ruth Brown.  My teachers were Bo Diddley.  My teachers were Little Willie John.  My teachers were Moms Mabley.  My teachers was, was Pigmeat Markham, my teachers were these people.  They taught me how to survive, how to make it; how to be streetwise, smart, and stay out of this and stay out of that.  One of the best teachers we ever had was a group called The Dells, who took us under their wing.  Marvin [Marvin Junior] and them, I see them.  We played with them about nine months ago, and it was just fun talking and reminiscing.  They took us under their wing.  The Flamingos were my teachers; they were my mothers and my fathers at that time.  Because I'm on the road, I'm away from home.  I remember the first time I left.  Here we have 'Tears on My Pillow,' the biggest thing on the planet.  And the next thing, we're put on a tour, a three-month tour.  And I ain't been away from my house three days.  I mean wait, wait, I'm exaggerating.  But the most I ever left my house was to go to Long Island [New York] with my in-laws to stay and have fun, and that was three months.  I'm sorry, that was less than a month.  So, here I'm gone three months on the r- on the road, going to every city in the world and the South when, when Jim Crow was at its height.
Story_ID: 598075
Speaker 1: So then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was not used to that.  I came out of an environment where I did what I wanted to do.  I sat there and, you know, I heard it when Emmett Till died.  I mean I knew it was something bad going on down there, you know.  And these people took me under their wing, they protected us.  They showed us how to survive, what to say, how to act.  "Don't do that, man.  Shut your mouth, I'll talk."  You know, because we--you could get somebody hurt not knowing.  We're street kids, we're--we don't understand this.  "Why can't we eat in there?"  You know, shut up.  LaVern [LaVern Baker] used to just (gesture) because we'd be on a bus together.  For three months we lived together--Joe Tex, Jackie Wilson.  We all lived together as a family, and doing these shows from the biggest show of stars.  [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick, all of them I met through doing these things.  And I'm thrown out there in a world--. The first job I ever had, I meet this fellow by the name of [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler and the Impressions out of Chicago [Illinois], and they was big with all the stuff they had.  And we had to go to Virginia, and it was Christmas Eve.  I'd never been away from my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] and father [Thomas Gourdine] in my life on Christmas Eve.  Christmas is my favorite time to this day.  My family, that's the time the family gets together.  I had to go away on Christmas?  I cried like a baby.  I was in Richmond, Virginia in some little dirty hotel with a radio on, where you put a quarter in the radio and they'd give you about an hours' music, and it was playing Christmas carols.  I cried like a baby, scared to death.  And I had to learn.  And they, those guys were tough, they were tough.  They didn't baby you.  Now, either you're going to grow up, or you're going to, you know, get out of our face.  And they just slapped us into submission.  And in a way it saved our lives, because they were old-timers, they knew that road.  But the other things--(laughter) they also influenced us on some things, too, which they shouldn't have been influencing.  So, yeah, you know what I mean.  But they made us grow up.  The stories I can tell you. Doc Bagby's band and orchestra and the (unclear) they used to have on the bus, just like they did in the big band days.  And you'd go from one city to another, you don't know where you're going.  You wake up, you're in Charleston [South Carolina].  You wake up the next morning you're in Boston [Massachusetts].  You know, that bus--that whole--you know, you get out (unclear) to sing, you'd perform.  You take a shower.  You can shower, if you showered in the facilities.  Get back on that bus, and you travel all night until the next place.  And maybe if you're lucky, they'd give you one or two days out of a month in a hotel.  Alabama, Gaston's Motel [A.G. Gaston Motel, Birmingham, Alabama], was the first time I'd ever been to a black-owned motel.  There we lived, learned, and met people from Jet magazine.  I met people from Johnson publication [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] down there, that's where I met them.  And it was just, it was like, it was just--then I got less homesick, less homesick, and less--and became a veteran.  And as time went on, I became, oh, this is what I do.  But in the meantime, we blew so much.  We didn't have the proper people to know, like Motown [Motown Records] did with their arti- some of the artists they did.  They put them in a position to be successful. We didn't have that.  They actually learned from us.  Because I mean Otis Williams [HistoryMaker Otis Clayborn Williams] was telling me, of the Temps [The Temptations] told me, "We learned from y'all what not to do" (laughter).

Speaker 1: When did the name [The Chesters] get changed to Little Anthony [Little Anthony and the Imperials]?  Who started calling you Little Anthony [HistoryMaker Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine]?
Speaker 2: Alan Freed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's legend.  I don't have the--all I go by is the legend when it was told to me that I had, knew Alan Freed when I was with the Duponts, but he didn't know I was the same person when we opened for his show in New York [New York].  And he, he, as it goes, they tell me that somebody came in and they played this song, 'Tears on My Pillow.'  And he said, "That girl sure can sing."  (Unclear) said, "That's not a girl, that's a guy."  And he says, "That's a guy?"  And he says, "That's a guy?  He must be little."  He just started saying "Little Anthony."  And they had to repeat--our fact check people--the original record said Imperials, and they made it Little Anthony and the Imperials, and that caused a problem with the guys in the group, because we all came up--you know how that is.  That's nothing new; that goes with every doggone group in the world.  That's jealousies, and rivalries, and cliques, and everybody, "Why is he got that?"  You know, they didn't understand that I was the voice at that time.  Then we all, we grown men now; that baggage is gone.  We call ourselves Sears and Roebuck.  I'm Sears, they Roebuck (laughter).
Story_ID: 598077
Speaker 1: So you actually were still The Chesters when 'Tears on My Pillow' came out (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Nods head) Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: So how did the name get changed?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's all public relations, they, they had to build this thing up.  And they--there was a man there by the name of Lou Galley, who was, who was their PR [public relations] man.  And he once said--they had like meetings on us, you know, how do we present--, you know.  He said, "That name's got to go.  That ain't got, there's nothing to that.  We've got to call it another name."  I said, "Well, what can we call it?"  He said, "Something regal, something kings, the kings--the Imperials."  I said, "There's a car called the Imperial, isn't it, the Chrysler?"  "Yeah, we have to clear that."  I remember hearing somebody say that.  He said, "How about the Imperials?"  And I said, "The Imperials?  All right, better than the Duponts."  (Laughter) So, "Okay," and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how did it become Little Anthony and the Imperials?
Speaker 2: Well, Alan Freed, who they call the father of rock and roll because he was the first guy to really play race music, or mixed music on the same show--nobody was doing that except for R and B people playing black music.  Other people were playing white folks' music, you know.  You know, they, they, it was weird, but it was.  But he was the first to start doing it.  And no one knew who he was.  His name was Moondog at first, but then somebody sued him and took his name away.  So he just used the 'Alan Freed House Party' [sic. 'The Moondog House'; 'Alan Freed's Rock and Roll Party'].  And when he would come on, everybody thought he was black.  So all the black people started listening to him.  Actually left the R and B stations, Dr. Jive, and started listening to him.  They thought he was black.  Then they found out he was white, and they went back to the--.  But he was playing black music, just like the R and B stations were, and he was killing them, he was killing them.  And he changed my name because he got--legend says that he got--somebody came up with the record, I guess, hawking the record or something, record company.  And they said, "Well, who's the girl?  It's a great song, who's the girl?"  They said, "It's not a girl, it's a guy."  He said, "He must be real little."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: That's how it came about, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 598078
Speaker 1: Tell me the whole band, the original--the band of Little Anthony and the Imperials.
Speaker 2: Well, of course there was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Besides yourself--
Speaker 2: --I think I told you--
Speaker 1: You were the lead singer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm the lead singer.  Then it was--the original--it's still original.  But we started out with five guys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One was Tracy Lord, and one was Nathaniel Rodgers.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They left in 1960.  Nathaniel Rodgers was drafted.  And Tracy fell in love, and he couldn't take the road anymore.  Remember I told you how homesick and stuff--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was as bad as I was.  He couldn't take it anymore, and things weren't going the way he thought, so he left.  So, it really was just me, Ernest [Ernest Wright, Jr.] and Clarence [Clarence Collins], and we brought this young man on in '62 [1962] by the name of Sammy Strain.  And we were together all the way up to 1975.
Speaker 1: And who was your musical director and keyboardist?
Speaker 2: Well, the first musical director we had was a man by the name of Joe Richardson.  We used to call him Tender Slim.  He used to be like--you know, he was from South Carolina, he could play that f- he played a guitar--I never saw it before--with a long neck.  And we called it a fender, and today it's called a Fender guitar.  And it was the first time I'd ever seen a guitar like that.  And he played that, and he was really, really good.  And then after him--oh, so many, oh my.  In fifty years there were so many.  We had some great ones.  We, we, we--oh gee, we had some people that--
Speaker 1: Who was Mary Elkler?
Speaker 2: Oh, Mary came years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mary Ekler.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean she came--I mean that's now, in this era (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But Hubert Laws, the great Hubert Laws--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, at the time, I needed a guitar player.  And he wanted to get back, because he's left Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York].  So he played, he majored in the trumpet, and he majored in the alto sax, tenor sax, flute, and all that, that was his major in Juilliard.  But he played--the secondary thing was the guitar.  So he needed a gig.  So he said, "I can play it."  And that was the first one.  There was another musical director who became--Hubert Laws, and his sister and all of them came.  So we, we had so many people that were so influential.  Pat Sherrod became one of the best jazz drummers around, and was with us for years; we picked up on him.  And the other musical director was Roger Bethelmy, he played with Stevie Wonder and all them cats.  He, eventually he left.  We've had some of the finest musicians who ever ca- Eric Gale played with us for two years.  Oh my gosh, it just goes on.  We played--"Pretty" Bernard Purdie who played with--so many people he played with, man--Aretha Franklin, that was her drummer for years, he played with us.  I probably missed somebody--I mean who became big stars on their own.  We're very fortunate like that.  To this day, we always seem to come up with these really good, fine people as musical directors, MDs.  And Steve [ph.] (unclear) was with me for thirteen years.  He went with Barry Manilow.  Ekler right now is with Rita Coolidge, and she plays with us sometimes.  You know, it was just--and after so many years, you build and develop a book, they call it the black book.  So we have other artists who will call us, "Man, can you help me out?  I need--" blah, blah, blah, "I need--" da, da, da, da.  And that's how that goes.
Story_ID: 598079
Speaker 1: So now we're in about 1959.  What is your second hit?
Speaker 2: It was the funniest thing.  We blew 'The Diary,' Neil Sedaka's tune, and everybody was upset.  It actually cost Richard Barrett his job.  George Goldner fired him.  But George came up with a song from some kid in Brooklyn [New York], and it was called 'Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko Bop.'  When I, when they played this song for us, I said, "I'm not going to sing that, that's terrible.  They're going to laugh at us, man.  We're not--that's so vanilla, you know."  I tell you, I can feel it's going to be a hit.  You know, sometimes you have to listen to other people; they see it from another perspective.  And I didn't want to do this song, I was so mad.  If you listen to me singing that song, there's not a lot of enthusiasm in my voice.  But, but, but it came out, he was right; it was a huge hit.  To this day I've had congressmen, I've had the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Myers [Richard Myers] come.  We did a thing in Washington, D.C. for all these bigwigs, who had to be cleared by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  And he came with his wife, and he said "Let me tell you something.  You sang--I love that song."  We had the biggest people--Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell], all of 'em, we're going 'Shimmy, Shimmy, Ko-Ko Bop'?  But yeah, they were kids, they loved it.  And that's what we found so much.  And that song, I have a little skit I do in the show that, I can't--think it's one of the dumbest songs I ever heard in my life.  We do a little thing like that.  And people loved it, but we do it anyway.  And they love it.  It's just crazy, I can't put my finger on it.
Story_ID: 598080
Speaker 1: Tell me about, about your rehearsals, and, and who picked your wardrobe and how--because the Imperials [Little Anthony and the Imperials] were always so immaculately dressed (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We still--that's something that to this day even--everybody talks about it.  We're cursed.  We just got to spend a ton of money the other day, just the other day.  We just developed this thing.  Like, Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] says, "Y'all, y'all so clean, it's scary."  We spend a lot of money on it, and we developed--it's something like Liberace.  We got into this bag, and it started with, with Richard Barrett, who's really a visionary, he had a great vision.  And he was really trying to teach us about pop music more and more.  And I already had that information from the days of Star Time [Star Time Studios, New York, New York] in my head, so it was easy for me to start doing stuff.  But he also said, "I gotta--you got to be--."  He said, "Two things. 50 percent of s-," well, no, "75 percent of success in show business is how you look."  In those days, that was.  Women are still glamorous today, but the guys--forgive me, they got to clean their act up.  And, well, Jay-Z's got it together, you know.  But he said, "75 percent is what you wear." And entering and exit, those are the disciplines he was trying to teach us.  So, he took us to this place called F and F Clothiers [New York, New York], who did, they made your clothes.  You'd just look at swatches, and what you liked, and whatever material they would recommend.  And they would measure you and actually make the whole thing.  And we were the only ones--and we got The Isley Brothers to go there.  Because the Isleys used to see us and say, "Man, where did--where did you all get that?"  "From this place called F and F."  And Jackie Wilson was going there at that time.  So, it was just us--Isley, Jackie and us; that was their client.  We was all clean.  If you would have seen us, we were all so clean.  They had to keep us separated to get--so we won't look alike and have something the same.  And so that's what started it.  And we got so involved in it.  And we had a man that came in the group, like--was Sammy Strain, who was immaculate; he loves clothes to this day.  Sammy is so clean.  He became--what we did was dedicate- we delegated different jobs to everybody.  Harold [Harold Jenkins] was wonderful at choreography and putting things together.  Clarence [Clarence Collins] to this day--he produced this new CD we got coming out.  He's very good.  He was always the guy that made the music and the harmony, to this day.  And then I was the creative head, like I would think of things to do on stage, and how to present us, and stuff like that.  That's how that happened.  And Harold, after Sammy left, Harold took over the clothing thing.  So we kind of listened to what he said.  So if he senses something, we'd go with it because he's usually right.  And we'd just delegate different things to different people.  All groups are like that; they all got different people to do certain things, certain things.
Story_ID: 598081
Speaker 1: In '63 [1963], you have a, another big hit.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: What year was it?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964], okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962] we broke up again.
Speaker 1: You broke up?
Speaker 2: I got--wanted to go into movies.  Because that's another story.  My mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine] got me into, she got me into acting as a little boy.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Through Star Time Studios [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about that (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I did some plays, I did some off-Broadway stuff, I did something for the Blind Institute [New York Institute for Education of the Blind; New York Institute for Special Education, Bronx, New York].  I played John in 'Life With Father' [Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse].  I did--and I got stung.  I love it to this day.  I've done a lot of things that people don't even know I've done it.  And I liked that.  So that was that part of my life, you know.
Speaker 1: So you broke up, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: And that was the time in '62 [1962] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I wanted to act.  And some lady came into my life and she said she was the manager of a great--an actress that--I forget the name of this lady.  Gene Tierney, Gene Tierney, she was managing her.  Didn't even remember the lady's name--Gloria [ph.] somebody.  And, and then the guys were acting crazy, still fighting that Little Anthony and the Imperials thing.  And there was a lot of friction.  And them Sam- and then Tray- Casey- Tracy [Tracy Lord] left because he got mad.  It was just breaking down.  And then, then, then, and then Nate [Nathaniel Rodgers] was drafted.  So it was just, everybody was un- everything was moving around, it was terrible.  And I saw that, and I said I want to be that.  And that was--we broke it.  I broke it up and left.  They kept singing, and developed far quicker than I did in their singing.  To survive, they went into the mountains, which was called the Jewish mountains [Catskill Mountains], the borscht circuit.  And they had to learn how to sing Jewish songs.  And (singing), 'Eli, Eli,' to this day I can do it.  It's (singing).  We had to sing that to survive.  They taught it to me, so they got better.  I went off, and this woman was a fraud.  In fact, I ended up in the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] calling me because they were looking for her (laughter).  Here I am stuck.  But we never lost our friendship, we just never did.  We were kids, we had all grown up together--me, Ernest [Ernest Wright, Jr.], Clarence [Clarence Collins], and myself.  And Clarence, one day Clarence called me and said, "Man, there's this guy, he said if we can get together, they'll put us in this place called the Town Hill in Brooklyn [New York]," which is a very famous club.  So we said, "All right, we'll just do it for that gig.  I'll come and just do that."  And we got together and rehearsed a little bit.  And (unclear), you know, we were very successful there.  From that, my manager at that time was Ernie Martinelli.  Now here we're going back to something that I told you about Teddy Randazzo.  Remember, later on in life, that I guy I met when I was with the Duponts, came back into my life.  Well, Teddy became a big producer with Don Costa, who was Frank Sinatra's producer.  They had a record company called Don Costa Production [Don Costa Productions, Inc., New York, New York].  My manager met him one day on the street, just walking down the street in Broadway.  And he said, "What happened to that guy, man?  I s- met him when he was a kid with the Duponts."  He said, "Oh, no, I manage him.  They're getting back together again."  And he said, "Have him come up and talk with us, man.  I've got a hunch."  And that's when we met Teddy and that's when we met Don Costa.  We got to talking and then he played us a song called 'Outside Looking In' ['I'm On The Outside (Looking In)']. And we decided, "Well, yeah, we'd like to do this."  So I decided--I was back with them again.
Story_ID: 598082
Speaker 1: Now I actually had a contract--I told you about those gangster people that came by to see me--with Morris Levy at Roulette Records.  Roulette Records, they wouldn't let me out of the contract, so I went back and told Don Costa.  Now remember, Don Costa is Sinatra's [Frank Sinatra] boy.  He said, "Well, don't worry about it."  He called Sinatra, I was out of the contract within two hours.  And we all know why that is.  And he said, "Just tell the kid he sings good."  And that's the only (unclear) I ever met Sinatra.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).  So, who wrote the song, 'I'm On The Outside (Looking In)'?
Speaker 1: Teddy Randazzo.
Speaker 2: Okay, so Teddy wrote that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And this is around the same time that Sammy Strain becomes a member of The O'Jays?
Speaker 1: No, this is way after that. Sammy was with us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Way after that?
Speaker 1: --on 'Goin' Out of my Head,' and 'Hurt So' ['Hurt So Bad']--he was there all the way.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was all the way to 1972 that he went into business with Redd Foxx and, and, and, and, and [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick and a bunch of other people.  They got a club together called the Meat Rack in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], and he just became an entrepreneur.  And there was a strained relationship anyway.  He was having problems with one of the guys in the group who took Ernest's [Ernest Wright, Jr.] place because Ernest left in 1959. His name was Bobby Wade.  They didn't do well together.  It wasn't me and him, but it was him and Bobby, it was just--they just couldn't see eye to eye on anything.  And so he got this chance to go into the business, and he left.  And then the business went under a couple of years later, and then he ended up having to--and one of The Temptations--we ran into The Temptations.  "Yeah, man, you know, The O'Jays are looking for--." Because (unclear), what's his name, died.  The boy died, and they needed another guy.  So they, they always were admiring the way we dressed, and our class.  They said, "Man, Sammy Strain, what is he doing?"  Well, that's how that happened.  He got in touch with them, and went with The O'Jays.
Story_ID: 598083
Speaker 1: So now you're with Don DeCosta, right?
Speaker 2: Don Costa.
Speaker 1: Don Costa?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you have a--now, I even remember Murray the K.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  So tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Murray the K. Murray was the replacement of Alan Freed.  After they crucified Alan, you know, we all know the story about that.  They destroyed him, and there was this void.
Speaker 1: You say we all know the story--
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but we don't.
Speaker 2: Well, okay, let me--
Speaker 1: So tell me, tell me the story.
Speaker 2: Okay, let me do it quickly.  Alan Freed was what they called the father of rock and roll.  Because he promoted black music so much, there was elements in this country that weren't going to have that.  So that he got set up from payola.  And he became an alcoholic.  He was so depressed, he lost everything.  And they just ripped him apart.  Well, Dick Clark got away with it, and all the others got away.  But he got, he was made an example.  So that's, that's so you know what happened to Alan Freed (laughter) what happened to him.
Speaker 1: A little trivia that they say is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what was that?
Speaker 2: With Alan Freed?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, the last record that he played before--
Speaker 2: The last record that he played was 'Shimmy, Shimmy, Ko-Ko Bop.'  He said, "This is Alan Freed, signing off."  It was told by Bob Dylan.  Bob Dylan wrote it in his thing, of the thing he remembered about Little Anthony and the Imperials.  He was a fan.  He said, "That was the last record I ever heard on Alan Freed when I was a kid."  And I wanted to be, you know, play.  And we all know who Bob Dylan is now.  So, we influenced a lot of people.  We didn't realize until now how many people--we didn't even realize it.
Speaker 1: So now, Murray the K comes on the scene?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Murray comes on around 1963, '62 [1962], '63 [1963].  He was a friend of Don Costa and all them and Teddy Randazzo.  And he was doing--he said he wanted to do the things that Alan used to do in the Brooklyn Paramount [Paramount Theatre, Brooklyn, New York], and all that.  Well, the Brooklyn Paramount decided they didn't want to do anymore rock and roll shows, because it was such bad publicity from that.  And then they were going into--becoming a university, the Long Island University [Brooklyn, New York], which is there now.  I just played it last week, and they still got the top part of the theater still there.  It was nice, a really nice homecoming.  And they--he found a place called the Fox Theatre, the Brooklyn Fox [Brooklyn Fox Theatre] over on Flatbush [Avenue] and Nevins [Street], and that's how we met him.  He had a very--I--WINS [WINS Radio, New York, New York] was going to get off the air.  They didn't want to do no more of this rock and roll stuff because it was just so bad with Alan Freed.  They were ready to let it go and become an all-news station.  But because he got so hot, they actually went a few more years with him, like seven years, before they went with (unclear), a news station.  So he got so big like Alan Freed, and he used to do shows just like Alan Freed, a following.  And he had all these sayings--the Swingin' Soiree and this.  And he became so big, and he played a lot of the black music.  But by that time everybody was playing it, but he was well-respected, you know, by all the black artists, and he wanted to play it.  Now, I can tell you something.  How's this for a bill?  Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross and The Supremes, The Miracles, Jay and the Americans, oh gosh, Joanne Campbell.
Speaker 1: Was Patti LaBelle?
Speaker 2: Patti LaBelle was on that show.  And also who was on that show was--oh, was it--not The Marvelettes.  I can't remember who it was.  That show, you couldn't even get that show--
Speaker 1: Martha and the Vandellas?
Speaker 2: Martha and the Vandellas was there, on that show, I remember that very much.  We became very close, we're friends.  That was one of the greatest--that was billion dollar worth of talent by today's standards.  Marvin Gaye's room was here, mine was here, Smokey's [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] room was there.  So we hung out all the time.  And then we did the show.  And I look back--somebody brought me the magazine one day, and I said, "Oh my goodness."  You couldn't even buy--that show, whew, was a heck of a show (laughter).
Speaker 1: But they used to make albums of Murray the K shows.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did, they did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So did everybody had a single on the album?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't remember.  I know he did it for so long, you know.  Johnny Mathis was closing one of the shows.  I mean, the kind of acts they got on that show was incredible.  They had lines wrapped around the corner.  The police had barriers, that's how big it was.  And we was his darlings.
Speaker 1: It was like playing the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did it the same time.  We were at the Apollo twice a year on contract.  And we would play there, at the Fox, and three months later we were at the Apollo.  It was crazy, but we loved every minute of it.  I mean it was just wonderful.
Story_ID: 598084
Speaker 1: And the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] was where we learned--I learned my business actually in the Apollo.  Because it was tough going there, man.  I mean, you, you slip and slide coming out of there, (laughter) you ain't going to make it.  Moms Mabley said, "Baby," she used to say, "Baby, I got to get y'all to come on this thing right.  Y'all are entering wrong, baby" (laughter).  So you got help from other artists.  You know, Redd [Redd Foxx] would say, "Man, say this, man.  This--I feel like, man, this will be funny if you say this."  And that's how we got on there.  And to this day, all these people--they may be dead, but they're alive in my head to this day.
Speaker 2: Well, how was it working with all these different groups, you know, at the same time?  What were the egos like?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It was very competitive.  I mean, it was funny stuff.  I remember The Isley Brothers were on the show, and we're in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at the Uptown Theater, Georgie Woods.  He's like the big cat in there.  And he had The Isley Brothers, The Flamingos, James Brown, Jackie Wilson on the same show--Dells [The Dells].  Stevie Wonder had just came out with 'Fingertips.'  (Laughter) So they--so we were in the middle of the show somewhere, and The Isley Brothers opened up.  If you ever saw The Isley Brothers, all three brothers, these guys are high energy.  I mean, they were like--they just tore the joint down start.  And they would come off the stage, and if you were just unfortunate enough to be the next act, they go, "Y'all better call the fire department and put that fire out."  (Laughter) "Y'all better." It was very competitive, very--it was like--it was just, you wanted to just set the stage on fire.  And the benefits, the people who benefitted from it was the audience.  They saw the best of these acts because they were out there giving all they had.  So, not because of the audience they wanted (unclear) act (laughter) that's how it was.  It was wonderful, it was wonderful, (unclear) was.
Speaker 2: Do you remember the first time you played the Apollo?
Speaker 1: Yeah, my first time, I actually went there on an audition one day.  And they said, "Come back, kid, when you're a singer, when you've got your thing together." It was just sad.  But 'Amateur Night' ['Amateur Night at the Apollo'], I couldn't even get through the amateur part that's how bad it was.  First time I played at the Apollo was in 1958.  It was the summer of '58 [1958], just after 'Tears on My Pillow' came out.  Maybe it wasn't even--'Tears on My Pillow' came out in June, and this was like August or September.  We went in there when it was hot; I remember how hot it was.  And I remember how disappointed I was in the theater.  Because we had already been in big theaters before, you know, and they had nice big dressing rooms.  It was (unclear), it was rough.  They had a cat upstairs at the top who used to cook for everybody.  He had a restaurant at the top of the theater.  And at first when I got there, I was scared.  I said, this is, this is primitive.  They had a mic that used to come out of the floor, and all three of the groups had to sing in that one mic, and then you had a mic.  And the band was Reuben Phillips' band.  And they were so impatient with you.  These guys were--and they were from the big band era where they were playing--you know, so they didn't want to play your stuff anyway.  So, but that's the work, they got to take the work.  So it was always the attitude at the Apollo.  And yet Mr. Schiffman [Frank Schiffman], who ran the place, and his son, he ran it with an iron fist, iron fist.  And I'm on there with Pigmeat Markham on the show, all these people on there, Moms Mabley, everybody--Little Willie John, all of them on the show.  And I got to go through this, you know, and I'm young.  But we held our own, we held our own.  We went out there and we did what we did, did it better than anybody could do it.  And we got respect from all those artists and became friends to this day, to this day, those who are alive.  Ruth just passed away, Ruth Brown, we all talk about it.

Speaker 1: Now do you remember your first television program?
Speaker 2: Yep (laughter).
Speaker 1: And who was--who were you on (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The first TV program I ever did was with one of the most bigoted men on the planet.  It was down in Baltimore [Maryland].  I can't--I wish Clarence [Clarence Collins] was here.  He--Clarence got one of them trap brains; he remembers everything.  This place was called something Baltimore.  You got to understand where Baltimore was.  Baltimore was like the beginning of the Mason-Dixon Line.  It was like, they didn't know whether to be southern or what.  So, it was bad.  And he was, he had to put us on the show.  Again, we were the first.  Because now we were so big in the white thing, the white audience wanted to see who these people were.  They thought we were white at first.  So, he had to put us on.  That was the very first TV show that I did with the Imperials [Little Anthony and the Imperials].  I did something before that, a little local thing, but that ain't what I want to talk about.  But that was the first, something really big.  And then the next one was Dick Clark ['American Bandstand'].  And I became friends with Dick to this day.  We were on there a zillion times.  Because once he, once he likes you, it's over.  And, hey, we sold a lot of records by going on that show.  But we went to Dick Clark.  And everything was lip-synching, you know, so it was easy.  We lip-synched everywhere we went.  So you sing--. But then a show came up and they were all excited.  We signed with GAC [General Artists Corporation], which was one of the top agencies at that time.  They got excited.  They said, "We got a surprise for you guys."  We said, "What?" "You're going to be on the sh- on 'Hit Parade' ['Your Hit Parade'].  "'Hit Parade'?"  It was all white, you know, nobody black--(unclear) Nat King Cole? Didn't care.  Snooky Lanson and that other girl (makes musical sounds).  It was a big hit.  We didn't look at it--but that's how I was looking at it.  And we went, and they told us we had to sing live.  We said, "Live?"  (Laughter) Oh my gosh I'm scared, you know.  We came with our little music, you know.  And it was nice.  We did it, and we were a big--we blew up again after doing that show.  It was national, we blew up.  Everybody started calling.  Everything--we said, "What?" Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me--well, Dick Clark's show was, they would have black performers--
Speaker 2: Very little.
Speaker 1: --sometimes.  But the audience was not black.
Speaker 2: No, there was nobody black in that audience.  It was lily white up until about--until he got pushed and pushed and pushed.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] got on his case, "You got all these black artists, but you ain't got no black people in your audience."  He, he was like any other person.  Personally, was he bigoted?  No.  But the network and the advertisers wouldn't let him do--he didn't care as far as he was concerned, but they would not have that, not them dancing together.  It wasn't until the '60s [1960s], it wasn't until the '60s [1960s] that there was this kid, a black kid and a black girl came on that wasn't white.  That was it.  But up to that point, no.
Speaker 1: Were your television performances the only time that you performed for an all-white audience?
Speaker 2: No, we did, we did Jocko's [Jocko Henderson] show ['Rocket Ship Show'], and that was an all-black audience.  He was a big disc jockey.  We did just about everything.  At that time there wasn't not that many black shows.  Obviously, there wasn't a lot of that going on.  But a lot of these record hop type shows were around the country.  Even out of Virginia, we went on a show like this where we met Otis Redding down there.  He was on the same show.  But--
Speaker 1: So most of the audiences were white?
Speaker 2: I would say 90 percent at that time.  And we're down--when we went to do some of the shows down south, it was all-black.  I mean, I actually performed one time--if you can imagine this is in Alabama.  They had a stage that had two sides--one side white, and one side black.  Now, where do you sing to?  So they told us that you had to sing to the white audience.  I said, "Well, our backs will be to the black audience."  And we're street kids, and that just bothered us to no end.  It really (unclear) my--and no one could think of it.  And I don't know if it was me, or who.  We came out on the stage, and we bowed to the black audience, we bowed to the white, and we sang to the wall.  So, they got the side of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have to stop now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's the way we protested (laughter).  That was our little protest.
Story_ID: 598086
Speaker 1: You were talking about the, about Birmingham [Alabama] experience, where you sang to the wall.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now tell me about that auditorium [Municipal Auditorium; Boutwell Memorial Auditorium, Birmingham, Alabama].  What has happened there?
Speaker 2: I don't know the name of the auditorium.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we stayed at a place called Gaston's [A.G. Gaston Motel, Birmingham, Alabama], which was a black motel.  It was--the 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama] where the little girls got blown up.  We were right there, we stayed at this place, area.  In fact, when we got there the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] warned us not to co- they didn't want the show to come.  Why they put that show on, I don't know.  They used to do things that didn't make sense.  So they put the show on because I guess money.  So they had two sides of the audience, one black, one white.  The day before we got in, there was some young black man who was--I don't know, he was running.  And we all were standing out, just standing out to get on the bus.  And they shot him dead, right in front of us.  Now, you got to think of the psyche in my mind.  I'm going--I'm eighteen or nineteen years old.  Emmett Till flashed in front of my face.  I'm, I'm in danger down here.  I realized I'm in danger.  And they intimidated us to the point that--I cannot not tell you--to the point where the promoters there said, "Well, we can't have--." We're going to have a black audience and a white audience.  But they made it so you couldn't--I don't know what they did.  But they put the curtain up, and you could be on--one side was black, and the other side was white.  And they told all the acts--Jimmy Reed (singing), "You got me running, you got me--," all of them--Big Joe Turner.  Everybody just sang to the white folks.  Because they came from the South; they was, they brought up--but I'm a New York [New York], bunch of hoodlum- you know, we don't know.  We got rebellious.  We didn't like the situation.  We didn't know why we did it, we just said, "Man, I ain't going to sing to no, no, no--my people are there, and we ain't singing--we're singing to white--."  Well, we went out there, and we couldn't turn around.  I said, we can't turn around.  So we just turned around and went to the wall.  Bo Diddley was on that show.  If you ever get the--ask him about that.  He remembers that, we talked about it.  We scared, we scared the entire tour artists.  "These fools going to get us all killed" (laughter). We sang to that wall, and the promoters turned red, beet red.  They were like--. And we came off, that was it.  And they just, the audience went crazy.  Then we turned towards them and said something, and they watched me.  And then I turned this way.  And that was the only way to protect--we didn't know no other way.
Speaker 1: But this auditorium--something happened.  What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Nods head) Yeah, prior to that.  A few months before that, Nat Cole [Nat King Cole] was kidnapped from his show at that auditorium.  That auditorium was terrible, man.  I never see--never saw it since, and I never want to see it.  It was miserable.
Story_ID: 598087
Speaker 1: Back to, to television shows because television was a lot different from doing live shows (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, way different.
Speaker 1: --wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Ed Sullivan.
Speaker 2: Um-hm (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now that was--Sunday night everybody watched Ed--
Speaker 2: That was the place to watch Ed.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Ed was a columnist, com-, comlet- com- comulist? Whatever the hell he was.  He was newspaper man, a com- comlet- (gesture).
Speaker 1: Columnist.
Speaker 2: There you go.  And he worked for the Daily Mirror [New York Daily Mirror] in New York City [New York, New York].  He was a very famous one.  And then he got his show ca- but the name of the show wasn't 'The Ed Sullivan Show' at that time.  It was called 'Toast of the Town,' and he was just the, the, the emcee, you know, he just would introduce people. Well, he was so stiff.  He was so, he was so bad that he was good. (Laughter) I mean (unclear). He actually became a character, I mean everybody dug it. He got so big that they turned it into 'The Ed Sullivan Show.' But people don't remember when it was 'Toast of the Town.'  The only black artist I saw on there was, was Pearl Bailey.  I didn't see Sammy Davis [Sammy Davis, Jr.] until later on.  Oh, the Will Mastin Trio was on there once, that was it.  There wasn't nobody going on there.  They--again, the sponsors and all of them didn't want any of this R and B, rock and roll stuff on the stage, because it was strictly pop stuff.  But you can't get bigger than a lot of the acts were getting.  I mean, Supremes [The Supremes] were blowing up.  The Temptations were blowing up.  Little Anthony and the Imperials were blowing up.  [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick was blowing up.  What could they do?  All this stuff was crossing over.  That's how we got the show, not because we were--they had to do it.  And we started doing it, and, and at--in time, Ed, (laughter) Ed Sull- Ed Sullivan, when we did the show, I was so scared because he was so cold.  And I said, "We're going to mess up."  And with Ed, if he called you over after you did your song that, that was that stamp of approval (claps hands).  And he said, he said, he says, "Those boys from Brooklyn [New York], come over here, boys."  (Laughter) We said, "Oh yeah" (laughter). And Ray Bloch was the orchestra leader, and Don Costa made sure all our charts were--.  And we used all them violins--and they never heard anything like that.  We did 'Hurt So Bad,' 'Goin' Out of My Head.'  And they just went--the lines lit up.  It was that good, they say.  I saw the actual--they redid it for PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] or something, the show, this summer.  It was really good.  We were young, too.  But that's how that was, very exciting.  And I get to meet a lot of people.  I met Tom Jones there, Petula Clark, other people from other countries.  You know, when you see these people that you came up with as a kid, and you're looking at them all--it's just a fascinating thing to me that made me feel--. It, most of my life's singing was just singing.  I sang, and that's what it did, it was better than working.  But when I got around thirty, thirty-two, thirty-three, I realized it was, that this was really what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.  This is it.  You, you'd better do good at it because this is it, buddy.  This is going to pay your rent.
Story_ID: 598088
Speaker 1: What other shows do you remember?  What about out in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], did you do 'The Tonight Show'?
Speaker 2: Well we did 'The Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'] in New York City [New York, New York] when, when Johnny [Johnny Carson] was in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And how we got that was we were playing at the lounge in Las Vegas [Nevada] at the Sahara [Sahara Hotel and Casino; SLS Las Vegas].  The Juni- what was the name of that lounge?  I forget.  The--whatever.
Speaker 1: The Copa [Copa Room]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It was called something else, but I don't remember.  But in the main room was Johnny Carson.  So they used, they used to have a thing called the peanut gallery, it was just for guests.  And of course we worked there.  And because we worked there, we didn't have to pay nothing, and we went in there to see Johnny Carson.  He was very funny.  His regular--his show was more funny than his TV thing, because he got to do all the skits.  And he looked up there, and he said "Oh," he said something about us up in that thing.  So the next day somebody said, "Man, Johnny Carson's in the audience, man."  Because we had the late shows.  We would do the one o'clock in the morning.  His show was at eight o'clock, and he's over.  He came with a bunch of people.  He came with Don Ho, him, and a bunch of people.  And they said, "Oh, oh, Johnny Carson's out there."  And we said, "Oh, that's nice."  And we went out and that was the best show we ever did in our life.  And he came to us, he says, "I want you guys to do my show.  I want you to do the show."  But he wasn't there.  By the time they booked us, he was on vacation.  So, Flip Wilson was taking his place.  If you saw when Flip used to do the--. He loved Flip.  So we did the show with Flip, and that was in New York City.  We did, we did the 'Shindig!' 'Shindig!' was a famous show, and that was in Los Angeles, where we met all the West Coast acts that we normally wouldn't have met.  I mean maybe, maybe not.  And we got friendly with all of them.
Speaker 1: There was another show, though.
Speaker 2: Steve Martin at that time was playing guitar in the band.  He was no comedian, I met him.  I c- c- oh, gee, just a lot of great artists; I can't remember.  That crazy son of a gun is up for murder right now--the girl was shot--I met him.  Just everybody.  I met--we worked with Aretha Franklin a lot.  This is where I met Ike and Tina Turner, worked with them for a month, we went on tour with them.
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, bizarre, bizarre.  Ike [Ike Turner] was, he loved Clarence [Clarence Collins].  To this day, he's still friends with--you know, they just liked each other.  But he was just a very country, rude dude, I mean with everybody else.  And the way he treated her was--I picked up on it, it was not very nice.  I mean, she didn't have a life.  It's like she sang, and that was it, you didn't see her no more.  You know, we were a bunch of kids running around trying to go out with The Ikettes, you know what I'm saying.  But very rare that we saw her.  And we always got the feeling--and Clarence told me, he said, "Man, this thing is strange."  So, we can tell.  But that was a heck of a show.  It was us and them and somebody else, I can't remember who it was.  And we toured all up in California.  We met Sonny and Cher that way.  We all--they came to see our show.  They were at the Cow Palace [Daly City, California] in San Francisco [California], and they came to see the show.  I met this young b- young guy who was trying to get his act together, his name was Sly Stone.  Then we started meeting all these people, all these big rock acts, you know, Joan Jett, all these people, man.  We started meeting, we started getting into the psychedelic world.  And it was just a phenomenal thing.  I mean we were like growing in leaps and bounds past all the people that really came up with us.  We left them, it was like another world we were in.  And, and, it's just amazing.
Story_ID: 598089
Speaker 1: So did you tour outside the country at this time also?
Speaker 2: No, here's the funny part about it.  Again, bad managers, bad people get, get into our lives.  We, we were street kids, man.  We trusted more the pimp and the hustler than we did the actual people who could have helped us.  Now if you ask me why, they can tell you.  Those were the people we knew.  Those were the people we were running around with, and we trusted them.  And they hustled us right in, (unclear) in the poor house, you know what I mean.  And they, and they blew it, they blew the things in Europe.  I didn't get to Europe, I didn't get to England until 1994.  People have asked me, "You mean to tell me you've never been to Europe?"  Unh-uh. We had the biggest records in the world there.  Time passed by, you forget.  Out of sight, out of mind.  But still we found all these records.  There was a record company, United Artists [United Artists Records].  When Don Costa sold his company [Don Costa Productions, Inc.] to United Artists, it was downhill after that.
Speaker 1: Well, during the '60s [1960s], I mean your group [Little Anthony and the Imperials] actually co-existed with--Motown was really big.  And you weren't with Motown [Motown Records]--
Speaker 2: We, we were all by ourselves.
Speaker 1: Then we had the British invasion.
Speaker 2: That came and we got part of that, too.  What happened was we got a call from the agency, that there was this group called The Beatles.  I never heard of them.  And there were no real records in America, but they was raising heck in Europe.  And they were coming to do their first concert tour.  And Murray the K, was (cough) was their sponsor, he used to call himself the fifth Beatle.  The agency called us and said, "They need an opening act."  At the time, we had 'Goin' Out of My Head.'  It was the number two record in the world (laughter).  We said, "We ain't opening for no doggone bugs."  So, we did the dumbest thing in the world.  Instead of management telling us, "No, this is different.  You need to get this new audience they got." We didn't have the people to do that.  My manager was, I don't even want to give you his name because he's down and out and he don't need to read nothing or hear nothing that would make it even worse.  But he was a street dude.  "Oh, man, we ain't going to do that. That's a lot of crap.  Y'all stars, y'all not supposed to be doing this."  That was the dumbest thing we ever did.  Again, we went on that show, it would have just given us a second shot, you know.  The group they took was The Chiffons.  (Laughter) We said no.
Speaker 1: So now you, you go to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And The Beatles wanted us, because they were big fans.
Speaker 1: They wanted you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Harrison [George Harrison] loved the stuff I did.  I found that out later. They were big fans of all black artists.  That's what most English groups--they love everything that we do. (Laughter) I said, okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 598090
Speaker 1: In '70 [1970], no in '69 [1969] is, is when you go to United Artists [United Artists Records], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you say things started--
Speaker 2: It had got, it just, it was just one mistake after another was made.  And once we went to United Artists--and then they had another group by the name of The 5th Dimension, which was h- which was on fire.  And so, all of their energy was with The 5th Dimension.  Now, we hadn't had a hit record since '66 [1966].  And you can get lost in the shuffle, and we got lost in the shuffle.  The promotion wasn't there, it just began to fall down.  The only people that stayed with us really was William Morris [William Morris Agency; William Morris Endeavor].  Those people really stuck it out with us.  Lee Salomon, who was the vice president of William Morris, really stuck it out with us, and started putting us on TV shows like 'Mike Douglas' ['The Mike Douglas Show'], all these shows, and it really helped us, it opened the way for us to come to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada].  And so we spent a lot of our time in Vegas developing our thing because we (unclear) couldn't make hit records anymore; it wasn't happening.  We went to Tommy Bell.  We ran into Thom Bell, who had The Stylistics and everybody else.  That's another strange story.  He--we were, we were with a new record company called Avco Embassy [Avco Embassy Records], and they got into a big fight with Tommy. Tommy had a song called 'Betcha My Golly Wow' [sic. 'Betcha By Golly Wow'] (laughter).  And another big smash.  We actually recorded--he has the actual recording.  I s- he moved to Hawaii, so I can't--I'd love to get ahold of the actual recording with us.  And so he couldn't--so what they--he wouldn't record us no more because he had to fight with them.  And I never could get the gist of what that fight was about, but we got caught in the middle.  And so he gave the songs to a group called The Stylistics (laughter).  So every time I hear them songs today, I go, "That's my song.  I'm supposed to been singing that."  That's the kind of thing that happened to Little Anthony and the Imperials.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now in '75 [1975] what, what, 1975, the group breaks up again?
Speaker 2: Yeah, breaks up--well, actually, only left is Clarence [Clarence Collins] and I.  Ernest [Ernest Wright, Jr.] is gone, Ernest left in '69 [1969].  Sammy [Sammy Strain] left in '71 [1971], '72 [1972].  So who's left was Bobby Wade, Harold Jenkins, myself and Clarence.  And we met Tommy Bell.  And Tommy was a great lover of this group.  He felt he could do it.  And we were just about ready to get ready to get there.  We did a thing called 'I'm Falling in Love With You,' which was, we got into the top twenty in that song.  And all we needed was that next step.  Then the fight started, and we got caught in the middle.  And so the songs that we were supposed to have, The Stylistics had.  And we just sat there and just cried.  And that was so traumatic that I said, "Gentlemen, I'm done, I'm done.  This is crazy."  We're just swimming. We're not going anywhere, upstream. You know, and Bobby Wade was getting a little strange, and tension with him and Clarence.  And you know we just, I just couldn't deal with it no more, and so I left.  I said, "Goodbye, guys."  And then went back into acting, and then started having children with my wife, Linda [Linda Duke Gourdine].
Story_ID: 598091
Speaker 1: When did you get married (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My boys, you see them all around here.  This is my son.  And we started having children.
Speaker 1: When did you get married?
Speaker 2: I got married in nineteen seventy--actually '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we met in '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: And your wife's name is?
Speaker 2: Linda [Linda Duke Gourdine].
Speaker 1: Linda, okay.  And then how many children do you have?
Speaker 2: We had four.  We have three biological children, and we adopted one, Sarah [Sarah Gourdine].
Speaker 1: Tell me your children's names.
Speaker 2: Sarah, there's Sarah, and there's Casey [Casey Gourdine].  Casey, my son, passed away four years ago in his sleep.  He (gesture).  Well, that's another story.  That's Casey, that one to the left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the oldest.  And there's Damon [Damon Gourdine], who's doing very well, by the way.  And Daniel [Daniel Gourdine], he lives in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And then my other sons is--from my other marriage is Andre [ph.], and then there's Tony [Tony Gourdine].  I feel like the old man in the shoe.  I've got so many kids I don't know what to do.  Grandchi- I got, I just found out I'm going to get my eleventh grandchild on the way.  And I've got three great-grandchildren.
Story_ID: 598092
Speaker 1: Anyway, you started having your family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you said you went back into acting?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I went--what ha- because that's what my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine]--you know, I said, I started thinking, you know, I got to--. You know I was working, but not as much.  And Linda [Linda Duke Gourdine] was schoolteacher; she's still schoolteacher today, to this day.  And we lived in, we lived in the Raintree apartments, really nice place in Culver City [California].  And I'm just trying to find my way.  And a friend of mine by the name of John Zinder [ph.], he was an actor--he was already doing TV, he was character actor.  And he said, "Man, you're pretty good, man.  I mean, you said, acting--why don't you come out and study, man, with this guy called David Alexander."  David Alexander was the guy that brought in Matthau [Walter Matthau] and he brought in Jack Lemmon.  And all these people studied under him for quite a while, other people, Raymond Burr, (unclear) people.  So I went, went to class.  I was just going to go for one day, and I stayed for two years.  Did a lot of plays, I did a lot of--in plays.  I did everything.  You name it, I did it.  And I got very good at what I was doing, he taught me.  And he actually surprised me one night.  I did a, I did a showcase on a thing called 'Slow Dance on the Killing Ground' [William Hanley].  And he brought in a guest, and they didn't tell me who it was.  And the guy came back and it was Jack Lemmon.  And he said, "You--I don't know who you are as a singer, but you're sure one heck of an actor."  And that was a good time in my life.  And so I got into that, the next thing I know I was doing TV.  I got agents.  I started doing character actors, movies, plays.  I did a big play in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] called 'Sisters' [ph.].  It almost went to Broadway, but something, something went down at the last minute.  They wanted me to go, but it didn't, didn't work out.  I did a couple of movies.  I did--
Speaker 1: What movies?
Speaker 2: I did a movie called 'Contact 303' with, with, with Mr. Fonda, Henry Fonda, and Chad Everett and Billy Dee Williams, when I met him.  And it was another world.  Now I'm not singing, I'm in another world now.  Quite comfortable in that world because I was already prepared a long time ago.  You know, it was just my studying and everything else.  So I felt I belonged, and they said I belonged, and it was fun working.  And that movie fell apart.  It didn't, it wasn't released.  I did another movie in 1980 called--I don't know what that was.  That was on cable, by the way.  Some people see it to this day, sometime they see it.  I played a tugboat guy.  And then the next thing you know, I met a lady by the name of Gloria Agario [ph.].  I don't know where she is.  She was a well-known black writer from the Negro Ensemble [Negro Ensemble Company] in New York [New York], and she wanted me to get into that.  But she hipped me to Gordon Davidson in L.A. at the Taper--Mark Taper Forum.  And she said, "Why don't you just--. Man, they got to see what you doing, man.  They know you as Little Anthony [HistoryMaker Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine], but they got to see what you do as an actor."  But I did a lot of--I did 'The Jeffersons' on television.  I did Raymond Burr.  I did a thing on Raymond Burr called 'Kingston: Confidential.'  I played--because I know dialects, I have a tendency to do them.  It was a Jamaican dude that they needed real bad.  And I just actually talked to their character--casting director over the telephone, and did it.  So when they told me what was happening, I just called them up and started talking with an accent.
Speaker 1: What did you say (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I don't remember what I said.  I said, you know, "My name is Anthony, and I call here 'cause somebody told me to call here right now.  So, I'm calling you."  And he said, "What?  Keep talking."  Got the job.  You know, you figure it all out, how to get it.  And then I made one thing after the other, and missed a lot of the ones I should have had.  'Roots,' I was out of town on that one, and I got back and they had already cast, I missed it.  Somebody had put me in that one, and got--I could have got a shot in that, but didn't.
Story_ID: 598093
Speaker 1: Then I--the biggest thing was in 1981 I got a call from Winkler- Winkler's [Irwin Winkler] office, Winkler and whatever that guy's name is who did all of De Niro's [Robert De Niro] stuff, all of De Niro's movies.  They were there, his producers, with, with the guy, the famous director.  And they called me, and my wife [Linda Duke Gourdine] remembers that.  We talk about this all the time.  And said, "Can you come down?  They want you to read at MGM [Metro Goldwyn Mayer Inc.; Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios Inc., Beverly Hills, California]."  MGM, cool. They were making at that time, 'King Kong,' the remake of 'King Kong,' not the newest 'King,' but the other one.  And you could hear the sounds and the noise.  I remember them going boom, bam.  I said, "What's going on here?"  Well, they're making 'King Kong,' and then--on the sound stage--.  And I walked in there, and they had a lady there.  And Gloria Agario [ph.] had told them that De Niro was a big fan.  I found out--I just left Al Pacino's brother.  We all went to dinner the other day.  All those guys, they all came up.  They were big fans of mine from back when they were young.  So, when he found out, he says, "Well, what do you mean, he asked her?"  Well, there was this movie they were doing, it was about Vietnam veterans.  And I was to play a principal role--that's good--of this guy that was really freaked out because somebody seen me doing 'Slow Dance on the Killing Ground' [William Hanley] when I played this crazy, insane person.  So, you know how this business is, they found out.  And I read for it.  And they were sitting, and I blew their minds.  And then they, and I read again and again.  And then they had somebody come in and read with me.  And we were supposed to meet.  De Niro was supposed to take a plane, come out and be with me, because he never did anything unless he could feel you in the movies or what--he'd just feel you.  And his style, and how he does it, you have to kind of go with him.  So everything was wonderful.  She was excited.  The writers' rike- writers' strike came in.  That writers' strike--I don't know if you remember--it went on for like a year or more, killed the project.  That's the story of my life. (Laughter) So that didn't work, so.  Somebody said, "Hey, man, they doing these oldie concerts, or this, whatever, revivals."  And they started handing that money to me, and I started going back out.  I started singing again, and I started bringing that money in.  And she got very accustomed to that money coming in.  So I'm going, well, I don't like this.  And to make a long story shorter, or longer, I ended up in New York City [New York, New York].  And a man by the name of Dick Fox called me in 1990.  He said, "Look, man, I got an idea for a thing called the 'Legends,' and I want to do it.  And would you be interested?"  And then we negotiated, and I said, "No, man, I ain't going to--."  He offered me a price, and I said, "Yeah, that's for the Imperials [Little Anthony and the Imperials].  What you going to pay me?"  I'm coming--now I'm much more stronger, I understand the game, you know.  So finally after two years he came back.  He said, "We're going to do this thing.  We really want you."  And they paid me a lot of money to do it.  And they had Bruce Springsteen band.  E Street Band was backing up, and they had everybody from The Ronettes to all--they had the, they had Ronnie Spector there.  That's Crazy Spector that I'm talking about--the girl got killed, him--. They had, they had Ben E. King and Charlie Thomas, the two original Drifters [The Drifters].  And they had all these people, it was a big show.  They had like fourteen, fifteen thousand people in there.  And I told the guys, I called them up.  I said, "We can make some quick money and get together for a minute."  Sammy [Sammy Strain] at the time was not doing as much with The O'Jays because The O'Jays wanted him to do more recording, more producing, because they were on the road.  So, he wasn't doing nothing.  He found out about it, and he called me.  He said, "Man, I heard about this show coming up."  I said, "You're with The O'Jays, you can't come with me."  "Yeah, I can."  (Laughter) So he called Eddie [HistoryMaker Eddie Levert], and he said "Cool, that's all right" because he wasn't doing nothing right now.  We were just going to do that one show, and that was 1992.  And that was the beginning of us coming back together again, and it was on a fluke.  There were no intentions of coming back.  I was working as a solo artist, and I said this is much better, no problems.  And man, we went, and the whole place went to crying.  People started crying, and everybody cried; my conductor cried.  And then Dick Clark found out about us through some people, and he called us.  He was doing that thing called 'Dick Clark's 40th Anniversary' on ABC.  And they had a young group called the Boyz II Men, and they wanted to do a contrast, old and new.  And once we did that show, it was such a huge success that letters came in from all over the networks.  And that was it.  We had to stay--to this day.
Story_ID: 598094
Speaker 1: Now you said you had a solo career?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Singing?
Speaker 2: Singing and acting.
Speaker 1: You told me about the acting.  But what about the solo career (unclear) the singing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was just singing as Little Anthony [HistoryMaker Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine], that's all.
Speaker 1: But what circuit were you singing?  Was it in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 2: Anywhere wherever they were listening to me. No, I was playing a lot of nightclubs.
Speaker 1: --in, in Las Vegas [Nevada]?
Speaker 2: In those days it was clubs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Vegas a lot.  There were clubs.  I did a lot of the revival shows.  I did a lot of things.  I did--one of the best jobs I ever did was a place called the Cellar, the Underground Cellar [ph.].  What was the name of that place?  It was in New York City [New York, New York], and it was a very quaint little place.  A lot of the well-known actors and singers played there, you know, really classy, real classy people, very rich.  And I ended up--and I did so well that they wanted to keep me for the rest of my life.  It's like the car lot, you know, they did with so many of the other artists.  It would have been a--it was a heck of a decision to make, that I can stay here for the rest of my life and I'm getting steady money.  What (laughter)?  I had to think about that.  And then I met Bill Parcells, the coach of the Giants [New York Giants], who was a big fan and came to see the show.  And he said, "I love--the thing I love about you is that you sweat just like my players sweat."  And that's when they won the Super Bowl.  And we were talking about the days--how he loved the things I did.  And the more I met people, especially there--because they're very wealthy people I'm meeting--I mean they were so influenced by what Little Anthony and the Imperials did.  And then I started thinking, dang, maybe my life wasn't (unclear)--gee, wow.  And I think that was a prelude to what was coming.  And then when '92 [1992] came, we got back together again.  But I loved that gig.  That was a cool gig.  I had some of the baddest musicians (unclear).  And it was my gig; it was my theater, packed every day.  You know, I'd walk in and I was a big man, I was a star.  And I did all the TV shows.  I did Regis Philbin and then--well, it was not this girl--Kathy.  It was the other one, Debbie, or whatever her name was.  It was Kathy Gibb--
Speaker 1: Kathie Lee Gifford.
Speaker 2: Kathie Lee Gifford was there at that time.  We sang a duet together.  I started doing all these--I started moving in areas that were like very classy.  And I developed this real cool thing that I got--a little Nat Cole [Nat King Cole], a little [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler.  I told Jerry Butler that I borrowed some of his stuff, man, (laughter) the Iceman, you know, being real cool.  I didn't, it wasn't high energy.  I was like just singing, just relying on my talent and my experience in how to make a song work, you know.  I was doing pretty good.  But then when they came with that big money about getting the Imperials back together (laughter) I said, well, I think I better think about this.  And so I did.
Story_ID: 598095
Speaker 1: Tell me what era in your life was the most significant for you?
Speaker 2: For me it's the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Tell me why (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because we went--well, in the '50s [1950s] we were called in those days--somebody made the word up.  I don't know what we were called, but we were like--they used to call us lollipop type acts.  Then somebody made the name doo-wop.  I don't know where that came from, I'm not really sure.  And we did what was considered doo-wop, you know, really ice cream music at that time, 'Shimmy, Shimmy, Ko-Ko Bop,' 'Tears on My Pillow,' really, you know, soft, fluffy stuff.  But when we went into the '60s [1960s] and we met Teddy Randazzo again and Don Costa, Don Costa told me, "Let me--you got a great voice, man.  But let me show you how to sing."  And this guy--we're doing violins, violas, cellos, huge orchestras.  I'm going what?  It was the most influential thing in my life to be the relationship with Don and Teddy.  Both of them are not with us anymore.  But like I told you earlier, Mrs. Mannix [Ethel Mannix], my music teacher [at P.S. 67, Charles A. Dorsey School, Brooklyn, New York]; my Aunt Bessie and my aunts; Teddy Randazzo; and Don Costa--in my whole life.  And one of the--oh, let me not forget Richard Barrett.  Those people will hold a very, very dear place in my heart, not because they were the nicest or smartest or whatever people and they didn't make a lot of mistakes, but they were so influential in where I have come, and where I'm at, and to the point that I can feel every minute of their influence on me today in one fashion or another.  And not just those people, but Redd Foxx was, I used to call him my second father.  He latched on to me when I was a kid, and put me under his wing.  Flip Wilson I knew.  We all knew each other when we were all broke, yeah.
Story_ID: 598096
Speaker 1: Sixties [1960s] that was just really, whew, man, it was heavy (laughter).
Speaker 2: The '60s [1960s] and civil rights. How did that--
Speaker 1: Oh (shakes head).
Speaker 2: --affect your music?
Speaker 1: You know, we weren't the type of group built or created to be--protest, or write something about how or what we were experiencing.  That wasn't our thing.  Maybe James Brown did it, 'I'm Black and I'm Proud' ['Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud'], and maybe one person here or there.  But we weren't built for that.  But what happened though, we experienced it first hand: the humiliation, the degradation of being a human being.  Not just being a human being, but being what we're told quote unquote stars, and to be treated with such indignity, such shame.  You know, it bugs me.  I've got to calm down, because I keep remembering it, and it brings back these memories.  The way we were treated was just, was awful.  But then on the other hand there were people, white and black, who, even from the South, did something good, or did--were better.  They just stood out among the others, and no, no, we're not like that.  Maybe that's what kept us going.  But I was in the airport in 1964, and I ran into Muhammad Ali.  No, it wasn't in '64 [1964], I'm wrong, I'm thinking about something else.  No, it was around '67 [1967].  I ran into him and Mr. Luther- Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] the same night (laughter) at the Atlanta [Georgia] airport [Atlanta Municipal Airport; Hartfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia]--the old airport, not the new one, the old one.  And, and, we ran into Muhammad.  He was sitting there with this little box or something he had.  And that was when they had took away--they wouldn't let him--you know, they were just beginning to get a lot of problems.  And we started laughing and talking.  'Cause we knew him from--he was a big fan.  We knew him years before.  And then at the same time he was in the restaurant, I went out to go to the bathroom or do something, and here comes--I said--the first one I saw was Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy], I recognized him.  They were coming in with an entourage from somewhere.  So I just walked up and said, "Mr. King, I'm, I sing with a group called Little Anthony [Little Anthony and the Imperials]--."  He said, "Oh, yeah.  My wife [Coretta Scott King] just loves that."  I felt like--. (Laughter) He was a little guy, he was about this big.  I was looking down at him.  So the '60s [1960s], that kind of stuff happened.
Story_ID: 598097
Speaker 1: And then in the same time, in the '60s [1960s], is when I was on a tour and we were in, in, in, in--gosh, where we were?  West Virginia.  You would think it would be better in West Virginia, it wasn't.  And in the tour, Bo Diddley went up to do his show.  And he was doing his Bo Diddley thing, you know, dancing.  And the cops next to me had a--he was like a trooper, one of them highway troopers, big, six feet.  I don't know, he looked like Goliath to me.  And his gun looked like Goliath's gun, that's how big that thing was.  That was one of them magnums, you know.  And I was admiring his gun.  That was a pretty gun, boy.  And he said to me, he said, "Oh, you niggers can dance, huh?"  I said, "Huh?"  And I didn't say anything.  I said to myself, stop, don't do nothing.  And I said, "Hey, is that a magnum that you have on?"  I'm just trying to hold a conversation.  "A magnum-something?" He said, "Yeah, that's to kill niggers like you."  We were in Tennessee, and the head of the black students association came to us, University of Tennessee [sic. Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], that came to our hotel and asked us, "Don't do the show there, please" because of all the mess that was going on down there in Memphis [Tennessee] at that time.  Memphis was--. And we stood our ground, and we didn't go.  And then we got threatened by every white racist group.  They were going to kill us--they were going to do this.  We tried to call the police to protect us, they wouldn't.  So the students of the Tennessee, the black students, they found the biggest brothers they could find, and they slept outside our door all night long to protect us because they knew we didn't go to that gig.  That's all they asked, please don't, don't.  We saw--we were in August- Valdosta, Georgia.  And it was LaVern Baker, Bo Diddley, quite a few thousand other people--The Chantels, I don't know, just a lot of groups on the tour.  And we had to play this barn.  I don't know how we got in a barn, but it was a giant barn that country singers sang there, too.  I guess it was a barn they had there.  And we--when you're on a bus that long, you have to find things to do.  So we, we had like softball.  So after rehearsal and the sound check, have a game of softball.  And we were playing, all of us were playing, Bo and all of us were playing softball.  And a truck came up, a pickup, a giant pickup, one of those old panel trucks came rolling up.  Ask Bo if you ever see him.  He'll tell you the same story and back me up on this one.  And all of these redneck cats with guns and rifles and everything were sitting in the truck, maybe twelve or thirteen, I don't know.  They said, "You boys going to be singing tonight?"  And we said, "Yeah, we're going to be singing."  "Y'all ain't gonna sing nothing.  We don't want no niggers here.  We don't want any your kind in town."  So somebody said, "Well, why did anybody book us here?"  "I don't know.  But y'all better not be here tonight because we got something for you if you come."  Well, I was taught by those guys to protect myself.  So prior to that, we were in Texas.  And now I know why they told us we'd better get guns.  So, we all brought pistols.  I had a .25 automatic.  Richard Barrett was there, he had a .38.  Bo had three or four guns.  This tour was armed.  And we had to do the show or run away.  We decided to do the show.  They came back with their guns, rolled the truck up.  And when they turned that truck up, we turned around I pulled out my--and we all went like this (gesture).  They, they, they--I f- swear, I think saw one of them was fainted.  They turned around and got that--that truck--the dust, you could see the dust coming out of the truck.  Why?  Because we weren't like--we city, we don't--we ain't got no sense.  On and on, I can tell you stories that go down that I--just misery and pain.
Story_ID: 598098
Speaker 1: And it was just like, embarrassment.  And, and sometimes we had to do things that we didn't want to do.  And, and a lot of black, some of the black organizations didn't--. You know we were caught between the two worlds, and we didn't know what to do sometimes, man.  Some of the artists--and LaVern [LaVern Baker] used to tell me, "Look, you're a singer.  What can you do?  Do your job."  I was with--I was taken--I missed the tour bus one day, and [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Price had (laughter) this big Cadillac.  So he happened to be--he went where he felt like, he was a big star.  So I had to go on the tour bus, but I missed the tour bus, fooling around there partying or something.  And the tour bus--, "If you ain't ready, goodbye."  So your job is to get to the next job any way you can.  So I saw Lloyd, you know, in the foyer there in the hotel.  I said, "Lloyd, I missed my bus, man."  He said, "You can come with me, man."  So, me and Lloyd Price was in that car.  And so we had to stop.  He had a big ole Fleetwood Cadillac [Cadillac Fleetwood].  We had to stop and get gas, and the gas men were looking at us like this.  And that's when a cop came.  And the cop said, "Hey, boy, what y'all doing with a car like that?  And anyway, you just went through town doing twenty-five miles sp- an hour."  We were going to die.  I said we going to die.  You could see it coming, you know.  And so, Lloyd being--he was smart.  Lloyd knew how to talk and just--, "No, we--I'm Lloyd Price and this is Little Anthony [HistoryMaker Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine]. We're on the biggest show."  They said, "Y'all one of them black singers, nigger singers?"  I said, "Yeah, yeah."  What we going to do?  We can't--we got to play the game.  "Well, now, you know what?  Y'all need to get y'all something less conspicuous."  They going to tell you what to drive.  I wanted to say I like Cadillacs. (Laughter) But I had to keep my mouth shut.  I drive it because I like it.  And they just, and they let us out, and followed us a ways.  We were in, we were in North Carolina--oh no, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  Again, we're being booked by a promoter there by the name of Cecil Corbett [Cecil Corbett, Jr.].  Well, we come in on the plane, which is not unusual in those days, we flew in.  And he had his secretary pick us up.  Well the secretary was white.  We're talking 1964, '65 [1965].  She drives us to the hotel, and it's evening, dusk.  And we see these lights (makes sounds) pulled us over.  And everybody, you know, was looking like that. And the cop came, held his gun like this, and looked into the window.  "Look a here, what's your name?  What's your name?"  "Well, I'm, I work for Mr. Cecil Corbett.  I'm his secretary, and I'm here to pick these boys up.  We're going to do a show" and whatever.  He said, "That's what it is?"  He said, "You sure you picked them up to go to the show?  Ain't nothing wrong here, is it?"  And he looked at me and said, "You boys sing?  Go on sing something for me."  We said, "Well, no, sir, we're tired, and we can't--."  I mean, that's not--no band or nothing.  "Y'all singers, huh?  I ain't never heard of you.  Now, I likes country music, myself."  He's holding a conversation, holding his gun half out the holster.  And we talked about this, Clarence [Clarence Collins] and I and Ernest [Ernest Wright, Jr.].  All you can think is I'm going to die.  They're never going to find our bodies, we're dead (laughter) you know.  We knew all about Chaney [James Chaney] and all that, we'd come through all of that.  We knew it was bad, it was tough down there then.  And that's just a small--I can go on and on and on.  There were so many incidents that we went through.  And I know many artists can tell you the same thing that they went through the same time.
Story_ID: 598099
Speaker 1: So did it eventually get better for entertainers?
Speaker 2: Yes, when, when the civil rights bill went through [Civil Rights Act of 1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In nine- in nineteen sixty- I believe it was '69 [sic.].  After Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] pushed that, to get that thing through.  The Dixiecrats, which were Democrats at that time, wouldn't want that bill to get through.  But it was the Republicans and some other arm thing they did that pulled the civil rights bill that we live by today.  It changed the whole South.  We saw it change overnight.
Speaker 1: That's what I was going to ask you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It became the law.  They had to follow the law.
Speaker 1: But you saw the change?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had to follow the law.  The one thing about southerners is that they want them--Americans understand law.  And as long--while the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] always ran, they manipulated the law so it looked like they were the ones doing the right thing, by you were the one doing the wrong thing.  But once you have a national law that comes through the [U.S.] Congress that says this--you cannot discriminate.  No place can do it because it's going to cost you your shirt if you do, then all of these chains started saying--they didn't like it, but we just took a shot.  One day we just said, let's go.  And we (unclear) the Holiday Inn in Georgia.  And boy, they were looking at us like, well, sign here.  Get the--go on and sign here.  They were just gritting their teeth (laughter).  But it was the law (laughter) that was it.  People died for that law.  A lot of people died for that law.  Luther King lost his life for that law.
Speaker 1: Did you not ever have any more problems?  I mean because every place didn't change overnight.  But where you went on tour after that, you just never had a problem when you wanted to go into a place that was not integrated before now (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It literally changed overnight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Literally, like they were scared.  It was a federal law, and they could get in federal trouble.  That's the last thing that people wanted.  I mean you go to the North--we had trouble in Chicago, Illinois, in Flint, Michigan, but they did it subtly, Washington, D.C., they just did it outright.  But the thing that I found out about them--the law.  Once the law--they knew what it was.  They knew that the game was up, the jig was up.  They just went off doing other things, but they knew the jig was up, that they had to go by the rules.  And that's how it was.  And the change that we s- now the South you see today, oh, my gosh.  No, there's no way.  I mean, come on.  It's another world, better than the North, as far as I'm concerned.  I'm going to get me something down there.  I like it down there (laughter).
Story_ID: 598100
Speaker 1: So what are your plans for Little Anthony [Little Anthony and the Imperials] in the future?
Speaker 2: Well right now we just finished a CD ['You'll Never Know'] that we did, and we're very fortunate to have some people involved who financed this.  It's a very big project.  We finished it, and we now--look like we're going to have Rhino Records [Rhino Entertainment Company], and the distribution and all of that.  And right now we're told we're going to do 'Letterman' ['Late Show with David Letterman'], we're going to do, we're trying to get 'Oprah' ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'].  We're trying to get this stuff, and do the CD and all that stuff.  So I'm very excited about that.  I'd like to go back to acting, that's something I'd like to do.  But right now my focus is on getting the CD and getting it going, and see where we go with it.  Now we're not going for the same thing that these kids go through because you can't.  The mainstream stations won't play it, because they're all youth orientated.  But there are a lot of other ways so beautiful.  There's the Internet, there's this, that.  And there's Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.], thank goodness.  People holler about Walmart, but Walmart and all them other large--all these places are distributors now.  You can get your stuff laid out.  I actually began to sell a lot of records all over again over (unclear) because the people that I came up with, they now have a place they can go to.  They can hear it on iTunes, they can hear you--they don't have to turn on the radio anymore.  They can hear you on Sirius radio [Sirius XM Radio, Inc.], I got that in my car.  They play everything, they don't care, you know.
Speaker 1: What music is going to be on this CD?
Speaker 2: This CD is, is something that Clarence [Clarence Collins] and I beat around for a few years, and we came up with an idea.  And Clarence--we actually did remixes on things.  In other words, we actually did a couple of--three things that we did--"Goin' Out of My Head," "Hurt So Bad," "Two People in the World."  We got fourteen, thirteen songs on it.  In fact, I'll give you a CD.  And on there, what we did was, I wrote a song called "You Don't Fun".  We had other writers.  We had, we have Jim Gilstrap, who worked with Stevie [Stevie Wonder] a lot, he wrote a few songs.  I did a duet with Deniece Williams.  We did a lot of things.  It was just a thought of--each song was thought--well thought out.  And we took "Goin' Out of My Head," and we actually did a--call it a remix, we did it entirely different in the way we would do it today, how we see it today.  And then we also did a remix on "Hurt So Bad."  But we always, we also figured we'd better do a remix on it the original way, just to give people an opportunity to figure out, oh my gosh, same song.  And then we did a thing that--because we're Brooklyn [New York] kids and New York [New York] kids.  We came up, like I said, with all these different people.  One was Puerto Rican so we was hanging with most of Puerto Ricans, and salsa music, we were raised up on that stuff.  So we actually--a man by the name of Zara- Toto Zara from Spain and a lot of Latin brothers, friends of mine we know in town--Danny Reyes [Daniel Reyes] and all these guys, bad boys--we put together a salsa song, and I sang a verse and a half of Spanish because I wanted to do something entirely different, and that's what we did.  So, the CD is a so- CD that we like to think is just artists doing their thing, man, like being creative.  And if you like it you'll buy it, you'll love it, and you'll listen to it.  That's how we see it.  And there's a lot of people out there, especially our people, who follow us everywhere.  We have a very devout, loyal audience.  They just go everywhere we go.  They're just getting old with us.

Speaker 1: Do you have any advice for someone just coming into the business?
Speaker 2: Oh my, oh my, my.  (Sigh) It is so much harder.  You'd be surprised.  That's why 'American Idol' is on there, that's why it's successful, but there's no place to go.  When I was a kid, I had places to fail--clubs and schools and churches.  You could sing anywhere, and they would listen to you--subways in New York [New York].  We sang in, under lamps, anywhere people listened.  Today you don't have that.  Today the corporate people have literally taken over the recording business, and everything is in the black.  It's about the black.  And these kids are, you know, the urban kids, they didn't have no money.  They didn't have no way to do anything, so they actually put--they put things together themselves, and technology allowed them to do it.  With the technology today, through the computer, man, you can take--you can do a whole record in your bathroom literally.  Yeah, a little bitty machine.  These kids did, and they started selling stuff out of the back of their cars.  That's what Jay-Z and them did.  And they started selling so much that the record company started taking notice of it.  But a lot of them, when they get into the business they have to go buy tracks and everything else because they don't have the experience to understand how to do it live.  Now, Jay-Z is--I've been watching him, I'm a fan of his, you see him.  I watched him grow, that's why I like him.  I saw him grow, and what's I like about him as opposed to a lot of the others.  And they don't have that, so they depend on 'American Idol.'  That's where the kids come out by the millions.  They got nowhere to go, they got no one to listen to them anymore.  There's no more George Goldners, or Morris Levys or Berry Gordys [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy], or where you can walk in and, "Hey, I want to sing a song," and they listen to you.  That's gone.  I feel sorry for them.  They make tons of more money than I ever made, but they ain't had nowhere near the fun that we got, we had.  We then we had, we had rivalry, but it was fun rivalry.  It was fun, we laughed at it today.  These kids are shooting each other.  (Laughter) What is that?  And it's a shame, because so many of them are very good, very, very good.  You know, and I think that it just reflects the society today.  I'm not going to blame them, it's just a reflection of what society is today.  Unfortunately it's not as good as it should be.  But when I see a Jay-Z then I feel good.  I never met the man, but I got a lot of love for this dude, man, and respect, because I watched him grow.  And when he's done. He t- he's a Brooklyn [New York] cat, man, and that made me feel real good, you know.  And I hope someday to meet him and shake his hand.  I met D.M.Z. [sic. Run-D.M.C.] and all them cats.  I got an award with them not along ago, last year.  And so, I wish them the best, man.  But, you know, I want the guys to dress up a little bit more, that's what I want.  Because the women are so glamorous.  They're the ones that's doing all the dressing.  What happened to the dudes?  Put some clothes on, y'all.  You know, this is show business.  (Laughter) Please, god dang.  (Unclear) legacy, oh. Don't look nasty, put on some clothes (laughter).
Story_ID: 598102
Speaker 1: Who--besides Jay-Z, who, who do you listen to?  Or who do you like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm really more into jazz.  I'm no- hardcore jazz, yeah, but not as much as smooth jazz.  Boney James, those kind of guys, I've always been--I'm also, believe it or not, I've been an opera fan since I was a kid.  And that's a long story, how I got into opera.  In fact, my wife [Linda Duke Gourdine] and I are planning on going to Italy next year. I want to go to La Scala [Teatro alla Scala, Milan, Italy].  I just want to see Puccini [Giacomo Puccini], and all those things I came up with.  I got introduced to Pascal's opera music by Richard Barrett, he opened my head.  And my teacher [at P.S. 67, Charles A. Dorsey School, Brooklyn, New York], Mrs. Mannix [Ethel Mannix], opened me and Clarence [Clarence Collins] when we were kids, and we got into it.  So, I'm a big opera fan.  And I like that jazz.  I still love rhythm and blues when it's done right, you know.  And Broadway tunes, I always loved Broadway shows.  There's always something great coming out of Broadway shows, love that.  And as far as rap is concerned, I'm not as heavy, but I do--Jay-Z is one of my boys.  I mean, I like the way--when he did the Annie thing from 'Annie' ["Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)"] that was it, he had me.  That was smart, man.  That was, I don't know anybody thought of that one (laughter).  Hard li- Hard life in Brooklyn [New York] (laughter).  And I like--and of course, the girls, it's Beyonce, I love her.  I love Christina Aguilera, man.  She's just, she's for real, man.  She's a real singer.  Mariah Carey--and there's a lot of women more than males that seems to be knocking everybody down these days.  And you know, obviously the people I came up with--the Nat Coles [Nat King Cole] and the Sinatras [Frank Sinatra] and Sammy Da- [Sammy Davis, Jr.] they all were the kind of people I was raised up with.  Ella Fitzgerald, her music is in my house now.  Learned a lot of them.  But I also learned a lot from just listening to some of the younger people today.  And gangster rap is not my thing.  I don't want to deal with it; that's not my thing.  It's, I can't go there.  I been--that's what I try to get away from.  So, but a lot of acts have done some really fun things.  Ludacris has a couple of funny things.  And what is the name of those two guys?  I forget.  Oh, I forget, they're very good.  Yeah, that's a few of them I like, you know, I do.  But the other hardcore--or whatever that is--I don't think I want to--it doesn't stimulate me.
Speaker 1: What about Outkast?
Speaker 2: Now that's who, that's who I was trying to talk about; I couldn't remember.  They funny, man, I like them.  I like Outkast a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just a lot of cats.  And D.M.C. [Run-D.M.C.], I like them a lot.  I know them, a couple of cats in there.  The Reverend [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run]--what's his name?  I never met him (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Run-D.M.C.?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I never really met him.  The other two guys I met.  And so that's really about it.  And there's a lot of women.  Most of the guys I know are more atta- attracted to women.  But years ago it was mostly men, and now its women.  I don't know if men are ever going to come back, but you know, you don't hear a lot of good R and B singing.  Once in a while, it'll pop up, you know.  Some guy will come up with a follow through and keep going.  It's very difficult, because the women are so dominating right now.  They're dominating the business, which is good.  It's about that time anyway.

Speaker 1: What advice would you give about management, and, and attorneys and royalties and--
Speaker 2: First thing, if you get an attorney, get an attorney that is a musical attorney.  And get information about that attorney, and make it your business to--make it--this is called show business.  Make it your business to do your business, and make sure you do, you research that person out.  I mean, you got the Internet now.  You got all kinds of--and you can find out a lot about people.  And find out (unclear) who's his clients?  You know, what has he done?  Because they're going to charge you a lot of money.  But if they can do the job and help to develop you to where you're going, and they believe in you, good.  Don't get a real estate lawyer, like I did, to be a musical lawyer.  Don't get somebody out of district attorney's office.  It's not going to work; they don't specialize in that.  You won't have a brain surgeon doing heart surgery on you.  It just isn't done that way.  And now that's the advice I'd give.  As far as managers, managers are a dime a dozen.  Excuse me, but they come out of the woodwork, and 90 percent of them are not worth the time of day.  But the other 10 percent are creative managers, they are hard to find.  The people that make--if you can make Britney Spears, you good, you good, you know what I mean.  You make NSYNC, you're good.
Speaker 1: What about Usher?
Speaker 2: I like Usher.  Usher, his voice is there, I mean he's got the chops.  I just sometimes wonder, why don't you spread out a little bit?  Try something, go against the grain.  It's almost like he's scared to--he wants to stay in that one area: I don't want to lose that money, man, I want to stick with my fans.  You're a creative human being.  Your creativity is what it's all about.  If you get an idea about something and you believe in that idea, go for it, doggone-it.  Don't have all these people--these yes men and everybody around you in your ear.  Miles Davis taught us that.  Now Miles did what he wanted to do, one of the greatest trumpeters there ever was.  Have you heard anybody play like Miles Davis?  He did stuff nobody would do, because nobody didn't want to get out of the mainstream.  I can go on and on, you know.  So I would suggest, man, if it's a manager, make sure he's rich.  And he can help you, and buy your way in.  You better have some talent.  But that's something, man.  What you really need is a good agent, a good lawyer.  And after that, man, if you can find a manager, you don't it's just, that's how I am, man, I don't know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 598104
Speaker 1: Because this is going to be viewed by future generations, is there a message that you would like to send to the future generation?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, kids today, and people today, for that matter, live in a world that's not very stable.  And, and I've always--because, see, I was raised--though I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't a b- a choir boy by any stretch of the imagination.  I mean I was more like Robin Hood as a kid.  But the Bible says train up a child in the way they should go when they're old, they'll never depart.  Because these wonderful women, these aunts I had--my mother [Elizabeth Stafford Gourdine], and my people down in Charleston [South Carolina] and Savannah [Georgia], and all these people that influenced me--one of the things they all have in common, especially on my mother's side, was that I was a spirit f- person, and that there was a God, an absolute, and someone I had to deal with, and that he had things laid out for me.  And if I go against that grain, then I'm taking my life into my own hands.  Now I've been through so many things in my life that I should have been dead, but I'm here by the grace of God.  So if I was giving some advice, man, don't try to think there's nothing here in this world but you.  They can talk about everything.  They can talk about whatever you want.  You can talk about evolution, you can talk about all.  But I know one thing, there is a creator far bigger than me.  And someone once told me, man, believe, not believe in God--it's harder not to believe than it is to believe.  And that faith and that spiritual bound in me brought me through more crap than I could possibly believe.  And I know a lot of performers who came up the same time I did, didn't have that.  They're dead, or they're destroyed, or they're just whatever it is.  I know that I know that I know.  It was something that loved me and kept me from going that one step in the wrong direction.  So my advice is, though a lot of kids didn't have what I had--I had a mama and daddy at home, I had a structure.  A lot of kids in the urban world today don't have a structure.  Daddy in jail, especially black kids.  Mama's this place, and that, and the kids are down there raising themselves.  But if there was anything I could tell those kids, man, you don't need--you don't need a church and you don't need anybody there.  You need to fall on your knees and say, I don't know who you are.  But if you really do exist, I need you.  Now, if you're going to show me, show me.  If you ain't going to do it, leave me alone.  He'll show himself to you.  My advice is to have that.  Once you have that foundation and understand who you are, then anything you do you'll succeed at it because that's what it's all about.  You'll have something to, to work from, (unclear) succeed.  Do that first, before you do anything in your life.  Then make your plan, focus.  You focus on something, you put blinders on.  And if that is where you want to go?  Eighty percent of any success is passion.  If you have a passion for something, don't let nobody tell you nothing.  If you really believe, if something in you is telling you you got to go in this direction, go that direction.  Chances are, it's going to take you to your success.  Because there are many people, they don't mean--they mean well.  But, you know, Johnny, you can't do that.  You need to get you a job.  All that wasting your time, painting all the time.  Boy, you better--.  You know, people do that.  You got to believe and understand.  And that's why I say the foundation of knowing who you are in your god, making your peace there spiritually, so that you can then--you're going to have another voice in there that's going to tell you, "Hey, you're right.  Go in that direction, that's where I want you.  That's what you were made for."  You know, and that's what's going to pull you through.  I heard what Fantasia [Fantasia Barrino] said on 'Idol' ['American Idol'].  Man, every time you hear a lot of those kids--it's--they all found that that gave them the strength to get through.  That's why I love that movie, 'Dreamgirls.'  You know, it's just, it's just knowing that.  And once you get that under your belt, then take your shot, because sometimes the journey is better than getting there.  Because there's an old story that I was told once.  An old person asked this lady--it was in a movie, actually.  And they asked the lady, they said, "How did you--you're eighty-something years old.  How did you deal with your husband and all the things you had to go through in life?"  She said, "Well, I look at it this way," she said.  "When we ever go to the amusement park, my husband would always go on, on, on the merry-go-round, and he'd go round and round and round.  I used to think, what does that do, going round and round?  I, on the other hand, loved the roller coaster.  I was scared to death of that roller coaster, scared to the point I couldn't hardly breathe.  We'd go up, we'd go down, we'd go sideways.  Oh, what a ride.  But when it came to an end, I was so exhilarated."  What do you want?  Do you want to be a spectator or a participator?  Do you want to ride the r- merry-go-round?  A lot of people do it.  Or do you want to go on the roller coaster?  Think about the roller coaster.  It's frightening, that's all I can say (laughter).  But what a ride.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I was thinking about that.  I told Clarence [Clarence Collins] the other day, man, I want to clear up some things in my life, my personal life, that I need to clear up.  And that is to leave with my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren, that that was their Poppy [ph.].  They call me Poppy.  My Poppy was somebody special.  He did things that I can't imagine.  But I'm a part of him, I am who he is.  He's my blood.  So if he got--I got his blood, then why can't I do that?  I want to leave a legacy that those children, my children and great-grandchildren, will see.  And even some other child, that ain't even related to me, will say, my goodness, look what that person did, and latch on to that.  Because I did.  That's the legacy I want to leave.  I don't want to leave a legacy of being a dope addict, or drugs, or he died in his vomit.  Oh, oh, no, no, you know.  I want to be able to, to, to die well (nods head).
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you'd like to say?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Well, I want to thank you for sharing your story--
Speaker 2: Thank you, Denise [Denise Gines] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and taking the time, you're very busy, out of your very busy schedule to, to tell us your story.
Speaker 2: I need to tell my story.  So thank you for giving me the opportunity.
Story_ID: 598106
Speaker 1: Well this one is with David Gest who was married to Liza Minnelli, we all know about that.  And this was in London, England, and this was for the Princess Di's [Diana, Princess of Wales] foundation, back before she died.  And this is Brenda Collins [Brenda Duke Collins].  That's Linda's [Linda Duke Gourdine] twin, identical twin sister, and obviously me.  Robert Wagner, Jill St. John, Clarence Collins and Ernest Wright [Ernest Wright, Jr.].
Speaker 2: All right, okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: That was in 1958 when we were with End Records.  And these two guys there in the front, that's Nathaniel Rodgers, Tracy Lord, and then there's Clarence Collins, Ernest Wright and guess who?
Speaker 2: All right, ready.
Speaker 1: This is 2003, and here in Las Vegas [Nevada] we had it done.  And of course you see there's Ernest to the left, top left, and Clarence Collins at the top to the right, and myself down at the bottom.  And Harold Jenkins was with us for about thirty-something years, came back in the group to take Sammy's [Sammy Strain] place.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Same dudes (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: That's (laughter) that's me when I was about six years old in New York City [New York, New York].  That would have been 1947 or something, I'm not really sure.  But I know it was New Year's because you could see the horn.
Speaker 2: 'Cause that bike you see was the Cadillac of bikes in those days.  That was a J.C. Higgins.  And my father [Thomas Gourdine] did everything he could and saved every dime to get me that bike because I wanted it so bad.  He got it for me for Christmas.
Speaker 1: Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: Those are the, these are the gang of kids that I talked about in the interview.  And it says on there 1940 whatever it says--'48 [1948], yeah.  I was seven years old.  My brother over there, my brother's Elliot [Elliot Gourdine (ph.)] I see.  Myself is on the left with a tie.  And bunch of--all these are the kids that I talked about.  We called them the Navy Street gang.
Speaker 1: Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: Up at the top left--of course, we talked about that picture; that was 1958.  This is around--that was 19- la, la, la oh, I lost myself--2004 over here we did a concert somewhere, I'm not really sure. And this one is when I was very, very young, with Tracy and Nate in the picture.  You see Ernest and Clarence to the left of the picture, and then in the middle of it is Nate, and then the next one is Tracy.  And then guess who, on the right.  That's Harold Jenkins doing a dance back in 1973 when we were singing.  So, and then this is us back in 2004.

Speaker 1: Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: This is a flashback, which it was done on a whim.  Gladys Knight needed to have something interesting to bring on her show because she was closing out after five years at the Flamingo [Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada].  And she came up with the idea of finding a bunch of the guys that we hung around with, get together and put together a show.  And we actually did put that show together.  From left to right, if I'm not mistaken, let me make sure.  That's [HistoryMaker] Harry Elston of The Friends of Distinction; Bubba Knight [HistoryMaker Merald "Bubba" Knight, Jr.] of the Pips, of Gladys Knight and the Pips.  And there I am in the middle.  And that's [HistoryMaker] Robert DeBlanc, who does a lot of shows around town.  And that's [HistoryMaker] Sonny Turner, who sang 'With This Ring' of The Platters, one of the original Platters.  And of course, that's [HistoryMaker] Lamonte McLemore of The 5th Dimension.
Speaker 1: Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: Oh, who's the babe (laughter)?  That's my wife, Linda.  We've been married for thirty-one years.  Where did I go wrong?  Oh, and that's me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm ready.
Speaker 2: Uh oh, that's part of the gang there.  That was two years ago.  I guess that would make that 2004.  Or--no, that was 2005, I think.  Yeah, New Year's, right.  Up at the right part of the picture there, that's my daughter, Sarah [Sarah Gourdine].  And then my son Daniel [Daniel Gourdine], and his fiancee, Isabel [ph.].  That's my son Damon [Damon Gourdine], that's his wife, Joy [Joy Gourdine]. And there's Linda to the right there.  And of course, that's my son Ca- Casey's [Casey Gourdine] son, that's Trey [ph.].  And of course, there's Bailey [ph.], I'm going to beat her up.  That's Bailey, and of course, there's me.
Speaker 1: Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: This is a rarity.  This doesn't happen often, especially when your children are all spread out all over the world, around the country.  I'm exaggerating, but these are my children.  These are all of my children, the first time I ever got them in the same place all at once.  To the right there is my daughter Sarah, then there's Daniel, Damon, my son Casey, who passed away four years ago, myself, my wife Linda, my son Tony [Tony Gourdine], my daughter, Lisa [ph.], my son Andre [ph.], and my oldest daughter Antoinette [ph.].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, this picture at the right is me, and obviously my wife Linda, looking pretty cool there, girl.  And this, this is the wife of, I can't remember the name of the gentleman there.  But he used to be on 'Father Knows Best.'  He played the oldest son.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: This picture is the Pioneer Award for black artists over the years that we got back in, this was 1992.  And this is Boyz of Men [sic.].  And in the middle is Ruth Brown, the great Ruth Brown, one of the finest R and B, rhythm and blues singers there ever was.  And that was 1992.  And Boyz II Men are those guys right there.
