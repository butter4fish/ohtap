Speaker 1: --name is [HM] Sandra [Ford] Johnson, and I am the interviewer for today.  [Edgar] Carey Lane is the videographer.  And we have no observers today.  Please state and spell your name, including your middle name.
Speaker 2: Okay, my name is Hilbert Dennis Stanley, H-I-L-B-E-R-T, Dennis, D-E-N-N-I-S, Stanley, S-T-A-N-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Your date of birth and location of birth.
Speaker 2: Okay, I was born February 24th, 1931 in Cambridge, Dorchester County, Maryland.  That's on the [Maryland] Eastern Shore.
Speaker 1: Today's date please.
Speaker 2: Today's date is March 6th, 2004.
Speaker 1: Please tell us the location of this interview, the address.
Speaker 2: Okay, you're at 413 George Street, which is in the historic district called Seton Hill in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well I started out as an educator, as a science teacher.  I became a department head, an assistant principal, and then I ended my career working as a principal of a high school, Edmondson[-Westside] High School in Baltimore, Lake Clifton High School [later, Lake Clifton Eastern High School] in Baltimore, Southwestern [Senior] High School in Baltimore, and during that time, I spent three years working in the mayor's office as liaison to education.  I did that for about three years.  And I spent one year working in the central office of the Baltimore City Public Schools.  I retired from the school system in 1990 and went to work with the National Black Catholic Congress [NBCC] as executive director.  And I retired from that job in October of 2002.  So now I am retired, officially, but I'm working a number of volunteer positions that keeps me going.

Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about five People magazine-ish type questions, and just bear with me.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food I guess has to be chicken.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I really don't have a favorite time of year.  I like summer, I like winter.  Now this year has been a lot different 'cause we've had a real severe winter.  But spring and fall are still good times for me, so I, I think I like being in an environment like this rather than being in one where it's all warm weather or all cold weather.
Speaker 1: You like variety.
Speaker 2: Variety, yes I do.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Well right now I think I'd have to say it's purple and gold, those are my fraternity, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity colors.
Speaker 1: What's your vaca- favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I think probably I'd have to say it's in Italy.  I spent a great deal of time in Italy when I was working with the National Black Catholic Congress [NBCC], and I traveled from northern Italy all the way to southern Italy.  And I enjoyed meeting people and seeing the historic sites there.  So I think that would probably be my favorite vacation slot.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite phrase or saying?  Do you have one?
Speaker 2: Well I guess I would have to say I have an African outfit that has the symbol God is omnipotent.  And I think that becomes my favorite saying because God is present wherever we are, and if we can accept that fact, then I think we'll be blessed.
Story_ID: 191947
Speaker 1: We're going to explore your family background.  Please tell me, start out by telling me about your mother.
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother.
Speaker 1: Her name.
Speaker 2: Her name was Emma Pauline Magee.
Speaker 1: Please spell it.
Speaker 2: M-A-G-E-E.  My father's name was James Hilbert Stanley, and that became my first name, the Hilbert, H-I-L-B-E-R-T.  They--
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in a town named Easton [Maryland], which was the county seat for Talbot County.  My fath--
Speaker 1: And did she grow up there?
Speaker 2: She grew up there.  My father was born in Trappe, Maryland, which is a small town just about ten miles from Easton.  And they--
Speaker 1: What do you know about your mom's background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: I don't know a lot about my mother and father's background.  I know they went to school in Easton, [Robert Russa] Moton High School [Easton, Maryland], which is the same school I graduated from.  She went to the ninth grade, and my father went to about the ninth grade.  And they were married in about 1930, and I was born in 1931.  Shortly after marriage, my sister was born in 1932, her name is Jewell Constance Stanley Duggins.  Jewell, J-E-W-E-L-L, Constance, C-O-N-S-T-A-N-C-E, Stanley, S-T-A-N-L-E-Y, and she's married and her married name is Duggins, D-U-G-G-I-N-S.
Story_ID: 191948
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your mom [Emma Magee Stanley Lewis].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Did she tell you or share any stories with you of her growing up?  And can you share those with us?
Speaker 2: Well shortly after my sister [Jewell Stanley Duggins] was born, my mother and my father [James Stanley] separated.  And my sister and I grew up in the home of my grandparents, who were in Easton [Maryland].  And those were my father's parents, Clara Stanley and James Stanley.  And I stayed there with them until I graduated from high school [Robert Russa Moton High School, Easton, Maryland].  My mother moved to Baltimore [Maryland] and my sister moved with her to Baltimore.  And she went to [Frederick] Douglass High School in Baltimore and graduated from Douglass.  And that way the only reason--I guess the only information I could say is that I knew my mother was living in Baltimore, she was working as a nurse's attendant with a private family in a very rich neighborhood of Baltimore.  And periodically I would visit her in Baltimore, but most of my time was spent with my grandparents.
Speaker 1: So she was a private nurse.
Speaker 2: Well she wasn't a nurse.  She had a nurse's assignment to look after kids and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And your father?
Speaker 2: My father remarried and he moved to Wilmington, Delaware.  And I did visit he and his wife a couple of times, but again, it wasn't a close relationship because really my grandmother and grandfather were like my parents as I was growing up.
Speaker 1: And their names, please, your grandparents.
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Clara Stanley, C-L-A-R-A, S-T-A-N-L-E-Y.  My grandfather's name was James Edward Stanley, J-A-M-E-S, middle name E-D-W-A-R-D, Stanley, S-T-A-N-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: What do you recall about visiting your dad in Delaware?  Were there many other African American families there?  Were--what was, what was the situation like?
Speaker 2: Well I think what it was, I went there and it was like for dinner.  And it was he and his wife and my father had had another son, and he was there.  And my grandmother had gone along, and it was just a family dinner and we returned back to Easton after dinner.
Speaker 1: So you did that several times.  I mean was it a regular thing?
Speaker 2: No it wasn't, it was just a couple of times that we did that.
Speaker 1: And so your, your memories then of your dad are kind of scant.
Speaker 2: They are.  I knew--
Speaker 1: What kind of work did he do?
Speaker 2: He worked with an oil company, and when he passed, in 1968, he had passed out--he was cleaning the inside of a oil storage tank.  And on his death certificate they mentioned that there was a heart failure.
Story_ID: 191949
Speaker 1: Can you trace your family back beyond your mom [Emma Magee Stanley Lewis] and dad [James Stanley] and your [paternal] grandparents [Clara Stanley and James Stanley]?  Tell us about your grandparents.
Speaker 2: Well my grandparents, my grandmother was a member of a Holiness church, and I grew up in a Holiness church.  We've visited the bishop's home in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] for conferences, to Atlantic City [New Jersey] where they had--not Atlantic City, to New Jersey where they had a farm where they had baptisms.  And that--she was a, a mother of the church.  It really was the way I grew up.  And of course when I came to Baltimore [Maryland] after I graduated from high school [Robert Russa Moton High School, Easton, Maryland], my mother had become Catholic and my sister [Jewell Stanley Duggins] had become Catholic.  And I decided maybe I should become Catholic, so I did, I took instructions and became Catholic.  So from 1948 until the present time, I have been a member of the Roman Catholic church.  My grandparents owned a home in Easton [Maryland].  It was a brick home which was kind of a new experience for African American families in that small town of Easton.  And this is gonna go aside from the question you asked, but when they passed, I was supposed to be the executor for the estate.  And I found out that the Easton hospital, which was located right next to where they lived, wanted to buy the house.  And I learned they wanted to tear it down to expand their parking lot.  So I interceded in that and I finally ended up giving the home to the church that my grandmother belonged to.  And that's what has happened to settle that property situation.  Because there were not many African American families who owned brick homes in Easton and I didn't want to see it torn down.
Speaker 1: Is it a historical site?
Speaker 2: It is a historic site.  When I was working in the mayor's office here in Baltimore, Mayor William Donald Schaefer, he was invited to speak to the city council in Easton and they sent him a book to show him something about historic Easton.  And he let me see the book because he knew I was from Easton.  And when I looked in the book, there was my grandmother's house and my grandfather's house.  So I asked him, I said since you're going to Easton and that's my home, I'd like to go with you, so I did.  And they had a, a dinner that night in the hotel, the Tidewater Inn in Easton where blacks had never been invited to participate.  So it was quite an experience to be there to meet the mayor and some of the politicians in Easton, and then to highlight the fact that my grandparents' home was a historic site in Easton.  And it's still standing there, and here I am living in Seton Hill [Baltimore, Maryland] in a historic house.  So I guess that's something that ran through our family.
Story_ID: 191950
Speaker 1: Around this time when you were born and living in Easton [Maryland] as you said yourself, there were not a lot of African Americans in that area.  Can you tell us what it was like growing up there?
Speaker 2: Well of course when I can remember back, in Easton there were two areas where blacks lived.  One was the--they called Port Road, which was near Port Street, P-O-R-T.  And the other section was called On the Hill.  And that would have been like on the east side of the, the town.  We were--
Speaker 1: And Easton, excuse me, but Easton is located exactly where?  For people that are hearing this and live out in Nevada, where would--might they find it on the map?
Speaker 2: Well in the State of Maryland, the Chesapeake Bay divides the state into the Western Shore and the [Maryland] Eastern Shore.  Easton is located along Route 50, and it's probably about thirty or forty miles from the Chesapeake Bay once you get on the Eastern Shore.  And it's let's say forty miles from the bay to Easton, and then if you keep going south, you go to Cambridge [Maryland], and then to Salisbury [Maryland], and those are the main towns on the Eastern Shore there.  There were not a lot of African Americans living there, but we also lived of course in this segregated setting where we had a black high school and the high school for other groups.  And the thing that I do want to mention is the fact that I went to Robert Russa Moton High School [Easton, Maryland].  And we only had eleven grades.  But the white school had twelfth, a twelfth grade.  So when I graduated from high school and was accepted at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], I was a year behind the other people at Morgan who were coming from New York [New York] and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and that kind of thing.  And I was selected, I selected biology to be my major.  Well the science program in my high school wasn't that outstanding.  And if I was gonna major in science, I had to take a foreign language.  Well we didn't have foreign language in high school.  But I think that's why I am still working with Morgan because Morgan helped me get a college education.  And I'm just so thankful that the faculty was so supportive and encouraging that I was able to survive the fact that I didn't have a twelfth grade when I finished high school.
Story_ID: 191951
Speaker 1: That's pretty much the setting.  I think we had very good teachers [at Robert Russa Moton High School, Easton, Maryland] who were dedicated, and as I think about how they were paid in those days, they were paid very little.  And most of them were from out of state.  And when you think about it, they had to pay rent and travel back and forth.  But they were really committed to teaching.  And--
Speaker 2: And where did--
Speaker 1: --did a good job.
Speaker 2: Where did most of the teachers live?  They didn't live in Easton [Maryland]?
Speaker 1: They lived in Easton.  What they did, they lived in houses, in family homes where they would have a room.  And many times they shared meals with the family that lived there.  And a lot of 'em were from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], New Jersey and frequently they would travel home on weekends.  But again when you think about the, the low salaries they were getting, they couldn't do this every weekend.  But that was it.  They were pretty much members of the family where they lived.  I do recall there was one house that was owned by a African American who moved to New Jersey and he rented his whole house to teachers.  And there were about five teachers that lived there.  And of course you know he was collecting good rent and they were taking care of the house, so frequently they would have meetings and invite some of us as students there where they would tutor us or mentor us and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Have you been back to this setting since say Brown vs. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]?  And can you share with us your impressions and how things have changed?
Speaker 1: Well what happened, the school, Moton High School was really Moton Elementary High School.  When you started first grade, you went to Moton and when you graduated, you graduated from Moton.  The principal--
Speaker 2: In the twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Eleventh grade.
Speaker 2: Eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: Eleventh grade.  The principal of the school when I was there was the principal when my mother [Emma Magee Stanley Lewis] was there.  And if I had lived in Easton, my, my son [Guy Stanley] and daughter [Denise Stanley] would have gone to Moton High School.  And then shortly thereafter he passed, but the point is after 1954 they built a school near Moton High School, a brick school, nice school.  The school we went to was a wooden school.  It was almost a fire hazard because they oiled the floors to keep the dust down and that kind of thing.  My grandfather [James Stanley] was the janitor there.  And of course I used to help him clean up the school after school.  But they closed that school and moved into the new school and changed that wooden--there were three buildings.  They changed those three buildings into apartments for African American families.  And I was so concerned because I said if they didn't put new floors in with all that oil it would be a real fire hazard.  But it's still standing now.  I was there just about six weeks ago.  And it's an apartment complex right now.  And I might say too that when they finally integrated the schools, they changed the Moton High School that they'd built to the elementary school and middle school.  And the high school students now go to the school that was built for whites.  So it's an integrated school right now.  And some of the teachers who were at Moton went to the white school.  And many people who've grown up in that kind of environment know that the African American teachers in many cases were much better prepared than some of the teachers they had in these other schools.  So I think we're moving in the right direction at this point.
Speaker 2: It--it's been told that they were fully certified and well prepared, college educated.  Whereas some of the other teachers were not.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And a lot of the teachers would get master's degrees and in the other schools they didn't have master's degrees.  So I think that's why I have been able to survive in an educational environment because they had committed teachers who worked with us and were really concerned about us.
Speaker 2: And they were--the same held when you went on to Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] is what you were sharing with us.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 191952
Speaker 1: So you knew your grandparents well. Were your grandparents on your mother's [Emma Magee Stanley Lewis] side?
Speaker 2: They were on my father's [James Stanley] side.  My mother's mother [Lavina Smith] passed when I was very young.  I do remember her vaguely, but never as a grandmother.
Speaker 1: And what about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I never knew my grandfather.  In fact, when my mother passed in 1990, I went through her records and found her birth certificate and I found two birth certificates.  And each of them had the name of a father who was different.  And you know during that time, the records recording our births and that kind of thing were not very accurate.  But I do remember she would tell me that this gentleman, Mr. Robert Goeby, was her father.  But then as I grew up, my grandmother would tell me that wasn't her father.  So I never did really know for sure who her father was and we never talked about that.
Story_ID: 191953
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?  Share some of those memories.  In other words, your holidays and your special events in your life and family life growing up with your [paternal] grandparents [Clara Stanley and James Stanley].
Speaker 2: Well I guess the big holiday was Christmas.  When we would go out and find a Christmas tree and come home and my grandmother's daughter lived right next door.  And they would do the trimming of the Christmas tree after they told us to go to bed.  And then you know Santa Claus would come while we were in bed, that was a big, big thing.  As I grew up and my mother [Emma Magee Stanley Lewis] was in Baltimore [Maryland], then I had opportunities to come to Baltimore and there was a ferry that left the [Maryland] Eastern Shore and came to Baltimore.  So we would come on the Love Point [Maryland] ferry and she would meet us down at the dock where right now in Baltimore that's the Inner Harbor, and that's the real tourist attraction for Baltimore right now.  And maybe I'd spend a weekend with my mother and she lived in a home--
Speaker 1: And your sister [Jewell Stanley Duggins].
Speaker 2: And my sister, yes.  And she lived in a family home where they rented the room and my mother and my sister shared that room.  And the people that owned the house had a son who was the same age as I was.  So we shared a room.  And that's how I visited, that was my vacation.  We didn't stay in hotels or anything like that.  But again, with my mother--my grandmother's [Clara Stanley] church, if there were conferences, I would go with her to the conferences and usually stay at a member's house in the place where we were visiting.  Like most of the time it was Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And then my grandfather [James Stanley] did not belong to that church, but he would drive us to Philadelphia or to New Jersey, and he might even come back home and then come back and pick us up, so that was it.
Speaker 1: So the family had a car.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Back in from the beginning of--
Speaker 2: In fact my grandfather spent more time waxing his car than anything else.  Every day he would come home from work and we had a garage, and he would back the car out and wax it and polish it and all this.  He worshipped that car (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you were the--actually the only young child growing up in that house at that time.
Speaker 2: After my sister came to Baltimore, I was.  But then my grandparents did a lot of child raising for other people in the family, like they had two daughters and a son.  And when they had kids, my grandmother would help raise them and it seemed like we all lived--the two sisters, one lived on the right side of the house and one lived on the left side of the house.  So it was really a family corner that they had.  But those kids were the--were not staying in the house with my grandmother.  They were close enough and she would play a major role in raising them.
Speaker 1: With you and your sister, by the way, what is her name?
Speaker 2: Jewell Constance Stanley Duggins.
Speaker 1: And are you the oldest?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm one year older than she is, and she doesn't like for me to tell people that she's just a year younger (laughter).
Story_ID: 191954
Speaker 1: What street did you live on in Easton [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: West Street.  128 West Street.
Speaker 1: Can you describe the block?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a block--actually west, 128 West Street, the block if I were fa- looking out my front door, the block to my left was all white families.  There were one, two, three families that lived in that block, and they had large lawns and all.  To my right were all black families in the 100 block.  But in that block there was a big garage that took up maybe space for four or five houses.  And in that block there might have been I would say ten families.  But as you got to the next--the end of the block to my right, there was a section that had stores and, and that kind of thing.  So it was a very small block.  And then behind us, because we lived on the corner, behind us was a funeral director, white funeral director's business.  And they had tombstones out on the yard.  And one of my aunts, my grandmother's [Clara Stanley] daughter, worked to keep an eye on the tombstones.  The company paid her to keep an eye on the tombstones so nobody went over there and fooled around with them, knocked 'em over and that kind of thing.  So we lived on a block that was African American, but we were surrounded by whites.
Story_ID: 191955
Speaker 1: Do you have any other memories of growing up, what it was like growing up [in Easton, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes I do.  The thing is I was--even though my grandmother [Clara Stanley] probably went to the first grade and that was it.  She couldn't read, but what always impressed me was if you're doing math problems like counting money, she could do it better than I could.  And she promoted education.  In other words, she didn't tell me to stay home if I felt bad.  She told me to go to school.  And if I felt bad, then I could come home later.  But she pushed education.  And that was a real, real important part in my life.  And then when I went--got to college, she promoted that.  And knowing really that they were not rich and thank heavens I was valedictorian of my high school [Robert Russa Moton High School, Easton, Maryland] class and I got a scholarship to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And what was so interesting, my mother [Emma Magee Stanley Lewis] gave me a hundred dollars at graduation to pay my way through college.  And my grandfather [James Stanley] not to be outdone, gave me a hundred dollars.  And that's the money I had to pay my way to college.  And they couldn't afford more than that, but thank heavens I was able to stay at Morgan for four years and graduate.  So my family pushed education.  And of course that's what I'm doing now with my grandchildren.
Story_ID: 191956
Speaker 1: In the town of Easton [Maryland] we were talking about that town and what it was like growing up.  And we know that there were not a lot of African Americans that lived there then.  Can you tell us a little bit about as you're describing your early years there, how that was and how things have evolved over the years and what it's like there now?
Speaker 2: Well initially when I was growing up, I only recall a couple of African Americans who had businesses.  One was an upholsterer, another one had a restaurant.  And the rest of the people worked in private families as caretakers, as maids and cooks and that kind of thing.  So really they were struggling to exist.  Now there are a lot more people who are entering professions and they're able to do a lot of things that they were not able to afford when I was growing up.  And they're also living in different sections of the town that were not open to African Americans when I was there.  We really were segregated, but growing up there, it didn't create a headache for you because you knew where you could go and where you didn't--you couldn't go.  And that was it.  And I remember I worked in a restaurant washing dishes one year.  And I said you know what?  When I grow up and I have enough money, I'm gonna come back here and have a meal.  Well I thought I could do that, but I know I couldn't.  But now the restaurant's closed, so I can't go back there.  But the thing is there are people now working in stores that couldn't get jobs before.  So it's, it's improving.  We still have some racism to deal with.  I don't care whether it's a small town like Easton or Baltimore [Maryland] or Washington [D.C.], whatever.  But it's much better now.
Story_ID: 191957
Speaker 1: Aside from the story you just told, as the valedictorian of the class [at Robert Russa Moton High School, Easton, Maryland], and you were fortunate enough to be able to go on to college [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  Did you have dreams and aspirations?  And if so, what was it that you thought about being in the future?
Speaker 2: Well I think my mother [Emma Magee Stanley Lewis] thought about this more than I did because she said I should become a pharmacist.  And that I could go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Well when we looked at the cost at Howard, I couldn't go there.  So when I got the scholarship to Morgan [State University], that's why I majored in biology.  I said well I'll major in biology and then when I graduate, maybe I can go to pharmacy.  But when I graduated from Morgan that was it.  Science was my field and I wasn't interested in going into pharmacy.  So--
Speaker 1: How did you get into science being your field?  How did that seem to happen or evolve (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think I was saying that I would prepare to go into pharmacy.  And when I came to Morgan, you know people are asking me what do you want to do.  And they would say well you know you ought to major in science, so that's what I did.  But then when I found out I had to take a foreign language.  If I look at my transcript today, that's the lowest grade I have on my transcript.  But I never had language before.  And even the science in high school was not at the level that you have in the high schools today.  Because when I was principal at Lake Clifton High School [later, Lake Clifton Eastern High School, Baltimore, Maryland], that was a new school built, they had science labs that compared to the kind you find in colleges today.  So you know it's improved, believe me.
Story_ID: 191958
Speaker 1: Where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: [Robert Russa] Moton [Easton, Maryland].  Moton Elementary, Moton Junior High and Moton Senior High.
Speaker 1: And who were your friends?
Speaker 2: Well like I said, there were three people that graduated from my class that came to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And one's living in Florida, one's living here in Baltimore [Maryland], there was one living outside of Washington [D.C.], he passed.
Speaker 1: They were your friends all through school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And all through school, and then all through college.  Now the one who lived outside of Washington had gone to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  But we still maintained contact.  And right now there are three people on the [Maryland] Eastern Shore that were in my class that we communicate with by way of email on the Internet.  And when we recently had a class reunion down there, it was good to see them.  And those are the only three that I know that are still living in that area.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.
Speaker 1: And who, who mostly influenced you?
Speaker 2: Well I tell you, I could start the first grade.  Ms. Beulah Caldwell [ph.] who really retired from school in Easton [Maryland] and came to Baltimore.  And I was working with Bethel A.M.E. Church [Baltimore, Maryland] when they were planning to open a school.  And when we got through the curriculum and all of that, they were looking for a principal.  And I said you know what?  I think you should call Ms. Caldwell and see if she would take the job, and she did.  So she was the opening principal and did a great job.  And then my second grade teacher lived in Atlantic City [New Jersey], she just passed last year.  And three of us went down to her funeral in Atlantic City.  And she had been very influential, she was a tough teacher on us.  But she kept us on the right path, and I liked that.
Speaker 1: In the second grade?
Speaker 2: In the second grade.  And then my English teacher was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], this was high school.  And she was so good and encouraging and helping us, and she was a member of the Morgan [State University] Alumni Association.  So I used to see her whenever we'd have alumni day.  And the last time we had alumni day she said she was moving to Atlanta [Georgia].  And I said, "Why are you doing that?  'Cause you're close and we can see each other."  She said well her daughter lives in Atlanta and you can imagine her age, having taught me in high school.  She said, "I want to be near my family," so she moved.  But I tell you I think almost every teacher I had had a real deep influence on my development.
Story_ID: 191959
Speaker 1: How did you spend your spare time?  Your extracurricular time.
Speaker 2: In high school [Robert Russa Moton High School, Easton, Maryland]?  Well I said I mentioned I worked with my grandfather [James Stanley] who was a janitor at the school.  And my uncle was the janitor at a theater in Easton [Maryland] that blacks could not attend.  So I used to work for him on Saturday.  And then I got a job working to be the janitor at the public library in Talbot County [Maryland].  And the strange thing, I had these jobs and what I tell my kids I made fifty cents an hour.  That was a lot of money for me at that time.  But those are the things when I was out of school, I was working.
Speaker 1: Interesting.  Did you play sports or--
Speaker 2: No I didn't play sports, but I was--the physical ed [education] teacher selected me to be the manager for the teams.  We didn't have football.  We had soccer, basketball and track.  So I was the manager for the teams and we used to travel a lot to schools on the [Maryland] Eastern Shore.
Speaker 1: That was fun.
Speaker 2: And a couple on the Western Shore.  So that was it.
Speaker 1: And were you involved with your church at that time?
Speaker 2: At my grandmother's [Clara Stanley] church, I was, and they had a youth program.  And we once got a lady that came in to work with the church and she wanted to form a youth choir.  So my sister [Jewell Stanley Duggins] and I joined the youth choir, not that we had any musical ability, but it was a way to get us to be a part of the church.  And that was very interesting.

Speaker 1: What would have happened do you think, had you not gotten the scholarship to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I don't think we could have afforded it because I tell you when my mother [Emma Magee Stanley Lewis] gave me the hundred dollars that was a big, big contribution.  And then when my grandfather [James Stanley] matched it, you know, well two hundred dollars is not gonna pay your way through one semester at college.  So the scholarship I had really carried the weight.  And I had a job.
Speaker 1: Had you, had you realized that as a young--I mean when did you realize that good grades might bring you that kind of a reward?  This is very important for children nowadays to know that from the beginning of high school you have to start being concerned about your good grades and possibly helping yourself by getting a coll- a college scholarship.  When did you--
Speaker 2: Well I think really the fact that my parents and grandparents were so focused on my getting an education, that that helped.  But when I started working, you know, hard at my studies, I wasn't thinking about college.  I was thinking about getting an education.  And then it was the senior year when I found out that I could possibly get a scholarship.  And when I did, that was a real awakening.  And when I applied to Morgan and got accepted, and had that money in the scholarship, it was great.  And I lived on campus.  So you know that was something else.
Speaker 1: So you were prepared.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: That's a great story for our youth of today.
Speaker 2: And see like I said earlier, that not a lot of people in Easton [Maryland] who went to college.  So you didn't have a lot of you know, your colleagues, co-students, who could say you know, you gotta go to college, you gotta go to college.  I can only remember maybe three or four people before me who went to college from Easton.
Story_ID: 191961
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any student organizations?
Speaker 2: I worked with the school newspaper, and that was pretty much it.  Because--
Speaker 1: Were you still working?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I had the jobs?  Oh, yeah I was still doing that in the school, but again--
Speaker 1: I mean at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], when you went on to Morgan.
Speaker 2: Oh, at Morgan.  Well when I went to Morgan, I worked in the cafeteria for a couple days and that wasn't gonna work.  And then I was a student assistant to the dean of men where you work in the office and answer the phone and that kind of thing.  So that helped me.  So--and then I took--
Speaker 1: That was a paying job?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then my senior year, no junior and senior year, I took ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and got paid there.  So that helped me pay my bills.  So I was kind of rich when I was junior and senior because with the scholarship and with the money I was making--oh, and one, two, three years I was the Chesterfield cigarette campus representative.  And I was the one that gave out these little four packs of cigarettes to students, and that's what I did and I got a little bit of money on that.  Now right now I wouldn't dare pass out any cigarettes.  But at that point it was a job.
Speaker 1: When did you become affiliated with your fraternity, which seems now to be a--
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-nine [1949].  I started Morgan in 1948, and you know the brothers in the fraternities begin to kind of recruit you.  And I was recruited by the Kappas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] and the Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  Well the strange thing about Morgan, the Omegas were strong on campus, and the Kap- Kappas were strong in the City of Baltimore [Maryland].  So I made a decision I'd rather be a brother to the people who live on campus than to be with the brothers in town because I did stay in the city one semester.
Story_ID: 191962
Speaker 1: And at that point, we had to walk from Loch Raven Boulevard [Baltimore, Maryland] down to the campus [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] because the buses didn't go down there.  Well that one semester I had to walk down there and I said this isn't gonna work, so I went back to the campus and that's where I stayed until I graduated.
Speaker 2: Tell us a little bit about why the, why didn't the buses work?  What was, what was happening in the city at that time racially speaking?
Speaker 1: Well to let you know that Morgan [State University] was a black institution.  And a lot of the students who went to Morgan lived on campus.  So they really didn't have a lot of people to warrant--I'm trying to justify why it was, but I know part of it was racism.  But a lot of the people, their parents would drive 'em there or some would take the bus like I did, walk down there.  Then you had to walk back up to catch the bus home and that kind of thing.  But now they do have buses that run to the campus and they're talking now about running a subway station to Morgan's campus, which will be a great thing.  But now Morgan has just built a new apartment complex for students and it's a dormitory complex.  But I went to visit and they're just like apartment buildings.  Much better than what they had when I was there.  But people, you know when you talk to students here in Baltimore [Maryland] and say you know, where do you want to go to college?  And they'll tell me and I'll say well why don't you go to Morgan?  I wanted to go someplace where I'm away from home.  Well if they go look at those apartments now at Morgan, they are away from home and I think it's gonna make a difference.  But the buses do go to campus now and it makes a difference.
Speaker 2: [HM] Dr. [Hilbert] Stanley what was it like though in the city back then?  Are you saying that Morgan being an all-black school, it was kind of isolated and maybe a little segregated out by itself?
Speaker 1: Sure was.  In fact, I'll tell you having grown up on the [Maryland] Eastern Shore and coming here, I went to a department store downtown one day.  And I stood there at the counter and nobody came to wait on me.  So finally I saw this woman, I asked her could she help me.  She said, "Do you work here?"  I said, "No I don't work here."  She said, "Well I can't serve you."  That was one of the big stores in Baltimore.  And I never spent a dime in that store afterwards, even after they opened up.  But that's the thing.  And right now with all the complaints you hear or read about in the paper about Morgan being given more money than somebody else.  Morgan is just trying to catch up with the things that they didn't get years ago.
Speaker 2: What year was that incident that you just described about--
Speaker 1: About the store?  That was '49 [1949], '48 [1948], '49 [1949], '50 [1950].  Because that was the early years here.  And the thing is [HM] Dr. [Earl S.] Richardson who's the president of Morgan now, has done an excellent job in trying to catch us up with all the things that we've done, we didn't get earlier.  And it's just great.
Speaker 2: So you're saying not only has the campus life changed, but also the relationship between the students and the people of this larger community, City of Baltimore.  Can you talk about that a little more?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I don't know if--a lot of people may not have heard about this, but Morgan has now the Carl Murphy Fine Arts Center, which just opened last year.  It compares to the [Joseph] Meyerhoff Symphony Hall [Baltimore, Maryland] in the city.  And we've had high class talent performing there, including the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.  And we're beginning to draw people from all races to the Morgan campus.  And when they get there and see what it looks like, they are awakened.  And we've had Jessye Norman who opened the Fine Arts Center with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.  And you would have thought you were at the Meyerhoff auditorium downtown.  But that was Morgan campus.  And the thing is we're now serving the city with that kind of facility.
Story_ID: 191963
Speaker 1: Back in the day, let's say around the '50s [1950s] and '49 [1949] so on, were you involved in any of the demonstrations that were going on?  Any parts of the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Not really, because that had happened before I got there.  There was a shopping center adjacent to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], a Northwood Shopping Center [Baltimore, Maryland].  And they didn't invite blacks up there, so there were students who picketed and that kind of thing.  That was done before I got there and when I got there, they weren't doing a whole lot of picketing.  But the thing is Morgan didn't have a gymnasium.  And whenever we played basketball, we had to come downtown to the games to play in the [Fifth Regiment] Armory [Baltimore, Maryland] or you know a facility here.  But again, that has changed now because what happened, we had a case last year where we were having trouble getting funded to build a new library at Morgan.  And we had students who were very upset and so was I.  So we took about eleven busloads of students to Annapolis [Maryland] to talk to the legislators about that because this is the students saying we need a library.  And so I was there for that and I'm still ready to help.  Just last week I was in Annapolis with the administration as they were presenting the budget for next year.  So I'm involved, let me tell you (laughter).
Story_ID: 191964
Speaker 1: You majored in college [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] in biology?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And after that experience, how did you get into your vocation?
Speaker 2: Well let's see.  When I went--I took ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], I went to the service.  When I got out of the service, I applied for a job in Baltimore [Maryland] and I started teaching at a high school.
Speaker 1: Where were you in service?  In what branch were you?
Speaker 2: I was in--initially I was in infantry, and then I transferred to artillery, and then I retired.  Not retired, I re- left the service and came to Baltimore.  And I started teaching at Edmondson[-Westside High School, Baltimore, Maryland] and the principal there was a retired [U.S.] Air Force officer.  And when he found out I was coming from the [U.S.] military, you know he became my mentor.  And I was successful there and I think after about two or three years I was offered a job as department head in a junior high school.  So I took that for a year.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was '69 [1969].  Stayed there one year, then Lake Clifton [High School, later, Lake Clifton Eastern High School, Baltimore, Maryland] opened.  And I was assigned there as an assistant principal.  They call it special assistants and I stayed there for a year.  Then they transferred me to Forest Park High School [Baltimore, Maryland] as assistant principal.  And what happened, we got a new superintendent, Dr. Roland Patterson who was hired to reorganize the school system into regions.  And I worked on the committee to develop those regions.  And I think he saw the talent that I had.  So after that one year at Forest Park I was appointed principal at Edmondson High School where I had started teaching.  So I stayed there for two and a half years.  And then I got a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study for the program they had for African Americans being trained to be superintendents.  So I took that.
Speaker 1: But you had gone back to school by now and gotten more degrees.
Speaker 2: Gotten my master's [degree], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So I did that in the summer.
Speaker 1: Where did you go to graduate school?
Speaker 2: Morgan [State University] to get my master's.
Speaker 1: In?
Speaker 2: Administration [sic. Ed.D. in administration from Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].  So then when I went on this internship, I spent a semester in Detroit [Michigan] working with the superintendent and a semester in Miami, Florida working with the superintendent.  And the thing I learned from that experience was I did not want to be a superintendent because it was so much politics involved.  And I was working at that level.  So when I came back, I was assigned to Lake Clifton as principal.  And I stayed there for a couple of years and then went to work in the mayor's office, Mayor [William Donald] Schaefer here in Baltimore as education liaison.  I stayed there for three and a half years and then came back to the--I was on leave from the school system.  Came back to the school system and was assigned one year to the central office, and then to principal at Southwestern [Senior] High School [Baltimore, Maryland].  And that's where I retired from in 1991.
Story_ID: 191965
Speaker 1: As a person who has had an opportunity to influence young people over a period of time, what do you--what would you say has been your most prominent initiative that you've tried to bring to bear to help young people?
Speaker 2: Well the main thing I try to do is encourage them that education is the key to success.  And the fact that you know you have these athletes who are good basketball players and football players, and I'm saying you know with that kind of talent, that's good and I commend you for it.  But you need to also be prepared to enter business.  For example if you become injured, but then after a certain age you may not be able to play so you need to have this background.  And I try to encourage them that way.  And then when--my last year of teaching I was teaching physics.  And I was--these were seniors taking physics.  And I would try to tell them, you know how important it was that you may not be interested in being a science major, but there're so many principles you can learn in physics that will help you be successful in other areas.  So I try to demonstrate to them that I had to work hard to learn what I'm teaching and I want to do the same thing with you, to teach you so you can be successful.
Story_ID: 191966
Speaker 1: Right now, I might say I'm working with the NAACP ACT-SO [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics] Program.
Speaker 2: Tell us about that.
Speaker 1: What that is, it's a program for high school students and it's ACT-SO means Afro-Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics [sic.].  And the students select projects or demonstrate their talent and it's competitive, and they get gold medals first prize, silver and bronze.  And then in July when the NAACP has its national convention, the gold medal winners from each city around the country goes to the convention and they compete.  And they get scholarships.  This past year I went to Miami [Florida] where they had the convention, and McDonald's gave the winners computers.  So it's a very, very good program.  And the students who win have a door open for them to go to college, et cetera.
Speaker 2: Is this a national program?
Speaker 1: National, yes.
Speaker 2: And how would those who are listening to this interview, how would they get involved?
Speaker 1: They would contact their NAACP chapter and ask them about the ACT-SO Program.  It's written A-C-T, dash, S-O.  And it's a high school talent program, or you could even go to the Internet and pull up the NAACP website and look for ACT-SO.  And right now I'm working with the Baltimore [Maryland] chapter and we're soliciting applications.  We've met with the high school principals to tell them about the program, and asking them to encourage their students who have talents in science, in music in art.  In fact what's so interesting, last year the gold medal winner for the national competition was a young lady from Baltimore.  She designed a hotel.  And it's not so much just designing it, but they have judges and they question you about your project.  And you've got to be able to explain it and justify it; it's an excellent program.  And what I've done also is to have the Baltimore chapter partner with Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] because I would like to see those winners come to Morgan because Morgan has excellent programs in all those areas that they have competition, mathematics and art and music and science.  So that's my retirement job.
Speaker 2: One of them it seems, because you have a few.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: We'll talk about that in a minute.  Are there any other highlights from your years as a school administrator that you would like to share with us?
Speaker 1: Well I think probably the main thing, you've got to be a leader.  And a leader has to be you know, stepping out to see where should we be going and try to plan for getting the school to go there.  But just to take a job as a principal and just go the way everybody else is going, doesn't move things.  And that's what I'm trying to do right now and I'll tell you when I worked with the National Black Catholic Congress [NBCC] and I can tell you this medal I'm wearing right now was awarded to me by the Pope [John Paul, II].
Story_ID: 191967
Speaker 1: --What kind of qualities does it take actually to be a good school administrator?  What are we looking for these days?
Speaker 2: Well I think the thing that I was looking for, you asked me earlier had I been involved in athletics when I was in high school [Robert Russa Moton High School, Easton, Maryland].  I was not, but I was a coach, a team man--
Speaker 1: Manager.
Speaker 2: Manager.  And what I'm saying--we have so much focus that we put on athletics in school and the people who are in music and they, you know, become stars and all.  I say but the people who are achieving in the academic area that would lead them to other kinds of professions, we need to work with them on that.  And when a student says I want to be a lawyer, I want to be a doctor, then--and they play football or basketball, well go on and do that, but you've also got to focus on the academic area.  And when my assignment at Edmondson[-Westside] High School [Baltimore, Maryland], I created a program which I called Career Majors.  And when students--I'd ask 'em what do you want to do when you graduate from high school?  And they would tell me and I say now these are the kinds of subjects you need to take to prepare for that, and they were in the academic area.  And it was so interesting because one class, in fact one of my graduates from Edmondson High School was just appointed by the governor to replace a delegate who died.  And he is now a delegate in the House of Delegates for the State of Maryland.  And his graduating class gave me a great big diploma when they graduated.  And what had happened, when they selected their career major, we would put a sticker on their diploma saying what their major was, and they gave me one.  And they had a career major on it, and it was for disciplinary removal.  And what they were saying is that students who didn't listen to you and try to do what you asked them to do, you sent them home to get their parents so the parents could come in and talk to you.  That's what I'm saying.  We need to involve parents in the educational process and not let them think that you send your kids to school and they're gonna take care of their education and their development, et cetera.
Speaker 1: Now I also hear you saying that we need to have more emphasis, perhaps on careers as young people are completing or going through their high school curriculum.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I think that's true.  And when I'd walk around the school and I'd see a junior let's say, and I'd say, "What do you want to be when you graduate?"  "I don't know."  Or even you'd talk to seniors and they'd say, "I don't know."  I'd say, "What would you like to do when you finish high school?"  "I don't know."  So then I'd try to get with those students and talk to them.  And I'd look at their grades and I'd say, "Look, your grades are good in this area.  What do you think could--kind of career do you think you could be in if you're a master in this area?"  And they began to think about it.  But you've got to sit down and talk with them and encourage them.
Speaker 1: Now [HM] Dr. [Hilbert] Stanley you were doing this as a school administrator.  What does the counseling staff do in the school?
Speaker 2: Well you gotta train the counselors to do that too because see some of the counselors will talk about you know when they select their courses, they look at the state or the system requirements that they have to have for graduation.  That's fine, but you need to talk to them and see so many schools, the counselor to student ratio is so high that they can't do that.  But I still work with the counselors and say look, I want you to do this.  And even if you have to schedule all of your students and they have to miss a half an hour of a class, I think it's important for you to work with them to get them to start thinking about which way they're going.
Speaker 1: So once again it comes back to the leadership.
Speaker 2: Exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The person at the top who is responsible, having that as a goal and an objective for these children in their particular schools.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 191968
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about your medals and your--particularly the one that you're wearing, and how does that fit into the whole scheme of things?
Speaker 2: Well I guess I need to say to you that when I retired from the school system [Baltimore City Public Schools], my mother [Emma Magee Stanley Lewis] had had a stroke and I had enough time to retire and I said I would retire and I'd spend time with her.  And I was beginning to work with my church and the National Black Catholic Congress [NBCC], which had been organized over a hundred years ago, they had five national meetings in the 1800s, and then they stopped.  And in 1987 they revived the congress movement and had a congress meeting in Washington [D.C.] and attracted people from the--in the Catholic church who were African American to that meeting, and had a re-awakening of that program.  Well when they planned that one, the bishop here [Baltimore, Maryland], Bishop John Ricard who's now the bishop of Pensacola-Tallahassee [Florida], asked me if I would work with them in planning, so I did.  And as it happened, I didn't go to the congress because I ended up in the hospital the day before it started.  And I couldn't go.  But it was such a success, I wanted to continue doing that.  So when I retired in 1991, my last day at work was on Friday.  On Sunday, I got a call from the bishop asking me if I would be willing to work a couple hours a week with the congress.  And I said yeah, I think I can do that.  So I was looking forward to working a couple hours a week.  In a couple of weeks, he wanted to know if I would be executive director because the executive director was from out of the city and she was gonna go home.  So I said here I go.  So I did.  But I worked with that because the point is growing up in the Holiness church, which was all black, and you know you have all the other predominantly African American congregations and, and religious groups.  A lot of the people I was working with were asking me, "Why do you belong to that white church?"  And I said you know what you need to look into this because we've had black Catholics in this country when the first people stepped on the soil.  Anyway I worked with the congress and as a part of my work, I, I had a project that was assigned to help build our Mother of Africa Chapel at the [Basilica of the] National Shrine [of the Immaculate Conception, Washington, D.C.] in Washington, which is the mother church for Catholics.  And in that shrine, there are ethnic chapels all around the walls of that church, but none dealing with blacks.  So when I started working on that, the leadership in the Catholic church here in Baltimore [Maryland] recognized that I had some skills to bring to that job.  So I was recommended to the Pope, Pope John Paul II, to be awarded an award, Knights of St. Gregory the Great, and that's what this medal is.  It's a--I was named a knight and this is one of the Pope's organizations.  And now whenever I go to Rome [Italy] and I have this on, then this introduces me to the guards and that kind of thing.  But also it lets people know that some African Americans are recognized by the Pope, and he said that many times that you know we need to serve all of our people.  And when we had the [Second] Vatican Council over when Pope John XXIII, they had the, the conference and they began to say we could have Mass in English and this kind of thing, it made a difference--
Story_ID: 191969
Speaker 1: --So I spent after I retired, about fifteen years working with the [National Black Catholic] Congress.  And one of the things we did and I feel most proud about, we built a chapel in the [Basilica of the] National Shrine [of the Immaculate Conception, Washington, D.C.] to our mother of Africa.  And we raised the money to build it.  We built it and had it dedicated in 1997, and I would certainly encourage everybody to visit there to see it because the artwork is excellent.
Speaker 2: Tell us again where it is.
Speaker 1: It's at the National Shrine in Washington, D.C., and it's the mother church of Catholics in the United States.  It's on the Catholic University [of America, Washington, D.C.] campus on Michigan Avenue and it's the--it's like our mother church in the country.
Speaker 2: Now how many other African Americans then are in your status--have--hold that status to be wearing that kind of a medal?
Speaker 1: There are a few.  I know of a couple, but there may be more because this--the roster is maintained in Rome [Italy].  There's one other person here in Baltimore [Maryland] that I know has one who's African American.
Speaker 2: And did you--how did you happen to have that in your possession?  Did you have to go there and be awarded, or how--
Speaker 1: No, what they do, they notify the archbishop of the diocese where you're located, and they present it to you.  In fact I just got a letter saying that they have some awards they're gonna give in a couple of weeks and they wanted me to be there with my medal to show people that I'm a Knight [of St. Gregory the Great].  And I think that's the key.  When you're talking about as a Catholic, as a Christian, we're charged to evangelize, to spread the word of our Heavenly Father to people who are un-churched and if they can see that I've been recognized by the Pope [John Paul, II], then that ought to help for them to listen to what I'm saying about the teachings of the Catholic church.
Story_ID: 191970
Speaker 1: So for the past fifteen years, you've been very much involved with your church, church work.
Speaker 2: Executive director [of National Black Catholic Congress, NBCC], yes.
Speaker 1: And can you describe those fifteen years and some of the things that you've experienced in your working with the [National Black Catholic] Congress and so on?
Speaker 2: Okay the national congress like I say, was reorganized in 1987 and because the bishop who was in charge here in Baltimore [Maryland], we had one black bishop, Bishop John Ricard.  The other black bishops elected him to be the chair person for the board of the National Black Catholic Congress.  So that's why the headquarters is located here.  But since I guess about four or five years ago, he was named bishop of Pensacola-Tallahassee [Florida], so my friends were asking me are you gonna move to Pensacola [Florida]?  I said no, I'm gone stay here.  So the office is still here, but we worked with more than 130 dioceses around the country.  From East Coast to West Coast.  And what happens in each dioceses that we work with, they have a contact person and in many cases they have an office of black Catholics, or an office of African American Catholics.  And we work with those people to work with their parishes in the dioceses.  We have training programs.  For example, one we had a pasturing workshop.  Because what happened, most of the pastors of our parishes are not African Americans because we don't have that many African American priests.  But those people who are serving as pastors know very little about African American history and culture.  And so often people who are assigned to a parish which is predominantly black, think they're being put out to pasture.  And they're not there for the real reason.  Well we've been working on that, and knowing that just because you're white and I'm black, you're gonna tell me how to save my soul.  We've got to work together at that, and that's what we're doing with the training programs.  We have a, a training program for lay people who work in the parishes so they can learn some of the things that lay people can do to help make the parish more effective in terms of what the parish should be; it's a family.  And we have youth programs.  So we've been working, and it's not just for African Americans, it's for people who working in African American parishes and communities.  And also we encourage the dioceses to have some of its staff members participate in the training program so they know what we're doing and how we're doing it.  And it's getting to be much more success.  So we have a National Congress every five years.  The first one was in '87 [1987] in Washington [D.C.].  That is in modern times.  They had five in the 1800s.  And I think probably what happened is these black folks in 1800 were making too much noise, so they cut it.  But then in '87 [1987] we revived it.
Speaker 1: What would they have been making too much noise about?
Speaker 2: Talking about what the black people ought to be able to do to be Catholic and all this kind of thing.  And I don't know there's anything written that says that's the reason, but if they were going, Daniel Rudd who was a newspaper publisher, was the founder of the congress movement.  And they grew and in five congresses they were beginning to gather more people together and they were becoming a real, I think, a challenge to the Catholic church in the United States.  So in--
Speaker 1: This was when?
Speaker 2: This was in the 1800s.  And then in '87 [1987] it was revived, and we've had one in Washington in '87 [1987], we had one in New Orleans [Louisiana] in '92 [1992].  Let's see, five, in '97 [1997] we had one here in Baltimore.  And at that time, we were dedicating the Our Mother of Africa Chapel in Washington.  And we had eighty-four buses that took people from Baltimore to Washington for the dedication.  And that was quite, quite an experience--
Story_ID: 191971
Speaker 1: But I'm very curious as to what kinds of issues would black Catholics be raising at this point in time?
Speaker 2: Well first of all, and there's some people who are being critical of this.  The fact that most of us grew up in Protestant environments where they had choirs that sang gospel music, spirituals in English.  We didn't grow up listening to Latin and Greek and the other things that we frequently had.  We also are used to very effective preaching.  And that's something that we have not been experiencing so these are things we're pushing.  Worship services.  Making the parish like a family because we would--and I've been through this situation myself, where we during the Mass, they invite you to turn to your neighbor and say, peace be with you, and shake your hand.  Well I've been to places where I reach out to shake the hand, and if it happened to be a white person, they don't wanna shake my hand.  Or--
Speaker 1: In church?
Speaker 2: In church, right.  So these are things we're trying to say, we're not saying the parish has to be all black, but we want to make sure that people feel comfortable when they come to church and when you invite somebody who's not Catholic to come to service and they don't understand what you're doing or what you're saying, then how do you expect them to say well I want to be a part of that?  So those are the things we're trying to do.  Greeting people.  When I was in Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], there was a parish near Morgan and I won't name it.  But the only reason we were able to go to Mass there is one of the teachers was Catholic.  And she used to pick up the Catholics and take them with her to Mass.  We didn't have a whole lot, but at least we were maintaining contact.  Because--
Speaker 1: She was African American?
Speaker 2: She was African American.  She was Catholic, and she worked with us and that helped.  Now that church has a very, very good pastor.  They have a number of Africans who are here in this city who go to that church.  And people feel comfortable going.
Story_ID: 191972
Speaker 1: And that's how I feel that we've been successful in the work of the [National Black Catholic] Congress [NBCC] and the fact that we were able to raise the money to build that chapel with that original artwork and I would tell people now you can go on the Internet and pull up the [Basilica of the] National Shrine [of the Immaculate Conception] in Washington [D.C.] and look for chapels, Our Mother of Africa Chapel.  Or if you take a trip to Washington, go by there and see it.  It is a beautiful, beautiful and very touching site in that, in that shrine.
Speaker 2: Tell us some of the features of the chapel and a little bit about the dedication.
Speaker 1: Okay what happened, we went through, and this was something that I'm saying was a real test of my education.  We were interviewing artists and the board said that we should have a black artist to develop the artwork in there.  Well I was a member of the National Alliance of Black School Educators [NABSE], and at one of their conferences there was an artist who did sculpture work, and it was excellent.  So I talked to him and we interviewed him, and plus we interviewed a number of artists.  But he's the one selected because when he came to present it to the committee at the shrine, and they do have an iconography committee that has to approve all the art that goes in that shrine.  And he came fully prepared.  And he was selected and he did a statute of Mary holding the baby Jesus.  He also did a bas-relief panel on one of the walls that shows Africans being taken from Africa into slavery across the Atlantic [Ocean] during the Middle Passage.  Shows them in slavery in the United States, the Civil Rights Movement.  And at the end of the panel, there's a family that emerges, a man, a woman and two children, to show that they have reached freedom.  We also have a cross over the altar.  The body of Christ was done in ebony wood by an African artist in Tanzania.  So that was our connection to the continent.
Story_ID: 191973
Speaker 1: In the altar in most Catholic churches they tried to put a relic of a saint in the altar before they seal it.  And we wanted to get a black saint to put in there [Our Mother of Africa Chapel, Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Washington, D.C.], and we couldn't get one.  But what happened, the bish--
Speaker 2: Because we didn't have any at that time?
Speaker 1: Yes, we had some black saints, but--and I won't go through the history of that, but we had a number of them.  And all we wanted to do was get a relic of one to put in the altar, well we didn't get it.  So the bishop who was the president of our board had met the Daughters of Charity of Canossa in Rome [Italy] during one of his meetings there.  And they gave him a relic of one of their sisters who was black.  Her name was [Saint] Josephine Bakhita.  She was kidnapped when she was seven years old from Sudan into slavery.  And she was abused and just mutilated and just a terrible experience.  And shortly after she was kidnapped into slavery, an Italian government official saw her and thought she was so beautiful and the same age as his daughter.  So he bought her and took her back to Italy.  And she went to school with his daughter and she became a member of the Daughters of Charity when she grew up.  And just did so much work to help children.  In fact one of the children asked her, said Sister--Mother--they called her Mother Josephine.  "If you met those slaves who kidnapped you right now, what would you do?"  She said, "I would get on my knees and kiss their hand because if they hadn't kidnapped me, I never would have met Christ."  So she learned all that while she was in Italy.  And when I found out that the bishop had this relic of her, I said look, maybe the church hasn't named her a saint, but I, I'm willing to say let's put her relic in the altar, and we did.  And we dedicated the chapel in 1997.  And in the year 2000, or it was actually 1999 we got word that the Pope [John Paul, II] was going to canonize her a saint.  So we had a saint in our altar after October 1st, 2000.  And the [National Black Catholic] Congress [NBCC] and as executive director, I planned a pilgrimage for her canonization.  And we had over ninety people who signed up to go to Rome for her canonization, and we did.  We went there the night before the canonization.  They had a program for her, and they told her life.  And they had a little girl who came from Sudan who played the role of Josephine at seven.  They had a young people's choir that sang.  And they sang with the Symphony Orchestra of Milan [Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi, Milan, Italy].  And you would have thought they had been together for years and years and years, they were so, so great.  Then the next day when they had the canonization, this youth choir was in St. Peter's Square [Vatican City] singing at the Mass that the Pope celebrated.  And she became a saint.  So we have a saint in the altar, her name is Saint Josephine Bakhita.  And if anybody would just go online and type in search B-A-K-H-I-T-A, it brings up a number of pages on her life from her order and from a number of other organizations that have really adopted her as their saint.  And because I was there for the canonization, she has become my saint.  So I'm a Knight of Saint Gregory [the Great], and she's my saint, Saint Josephine Bakhita.  So I hope everybody will understand that.  And the thing is she was canonized the same Mass that [Saint] Katharine Drexel was canonized, and she was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  She was a white sister and did an awful lot of work creating Catholic schools for blacks and Indians.  She gave a lot of money and she was from a rich family, that's why she's able to do this.
Speaker 2: What is her name?
Speaker 1: Katharine Drexel.
Speaker 2: Spell it.
Speaker 1: D-R-E-X-E-L.  In fact Drexel University in Philadelphia is named after her family.  But she gave money that was really foundation money for the founding of Xavier University [of Louisiana] in New Orleans [Louisiana].  X-A-V-I-E-R.  So she was canonized the same time Josephine Bakhita was.  And a lot of people are promoting Saint Katharine Drexel.  And I'm saying let's can- let's recognize Saint Josephine Bakhita because they're both very, very important to us as African Americans, but also to the whole world.  But we ought to claim her.
Story_ID: 191974
Speaker 1: First of all, exactly where did you earn your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: I got a Ed.D. from Wayne State University in Detroit [Michigan].  And that--
Speaker 1: How did you work your way to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Well what happened, when I was the superintendent, in the superintendent training program sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, I spent six months in Detroit working with the superintendent, and six months in Miami [Florida] working with the superintendent.  And while I was in Detroit, the people there said you know you ought to come back here and work on your doctorate, 'cause I hadn't even thought about working on a doctorate.  So when I finished in Miami, I came back to Baltimore [Maryland] and I got a call from Detroit saying are you coming to Wayne?  I said I guess, can I afford it?  Well I got a position in the School of Education [sic. College of Education] at Wayne State, which gave me tuition free to work on my doctorate.  I took leave from the school system [Baltimore City Public Schools] to go there and work on that.  And what I had planned to do was just go there and take my coursework because I had taken some coursework here at Johns Hopkins University [Baltimore, Maryland].  And they took those credits, so I really didn't have, you know, a lot of courses to take.  And I said to myself well I'll take the courses and I'll come back home and write my dissertation.  Well while I was there, my advisor said don't do that.  Said because I have too many people who've gone home to write their dissertation, they never write it.  So I stayed there and wrote my dissertation and got my degree.
Speaker 1: And what was your dissertation topic?
Speaker 2: I wrote on the superintendent training program by the Rockefeller Foundation.  And what I did, I surveyed people who had been through the program and tried to find out what advantages did they get through participation.  And that was my, my study.
Speaker 1: So when did you finish?  When did you actually receive your degree (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen seventy-eight [1978]--
Story_ID: 191975
Speaker 1: And one of the highlights that you've talked about during this interview was your pilgrimage to the canonization of the black saint.  So could you tell us a little bit about that?  I mean not too many people have done--had an experience like that so we'd like to hear (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Well the main thing I want to say over and over again and loud, Saint Josephine Bakhita, B-A-K-H-I-T-A.  She is the person who was kidnapped when she was seven years old into slavery and I said that before.  But the point is when we put her relic in the altar at our Mother of Africa Chapel [Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Washington, D.C.], and I found out she was gonna be canonized, I said we need to have people there to witness this canonization so they make it more real that it's important that she's in the altar.  And what I did, I contacted the order that she belonged to, which was the Daughters of Charity of Canossa.  They were in Rome [Italy].  And when I went to Rome to check on the--some of the artwork that was being done for our Mother of Africa Chapel, I met with the Daughters of Charity of Canossa and found out that they had sisters in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  So I contacted them and told them that we wanted to do a pilgrimage to Rome for the canonization and of course you know they were all excited about it because she was one of their sisters.  So I had a person there in Albuquerque who worked with sisters they had here in the United States and in Mexico.  And I worked with the offices of the dioceses that we worked with, and that was 130 and had them register.  I got a travel agent here in Baltimore [Maryland] to work with us and they had people in Rome who knew the sights and they were gonna be our guides and all.  So we sent out the notices and we had over ninety people who signed up.  We got some people like the ones from the West Coast, met us at the airport in New York [New York].  And the ones from Baltimore, we went by bus to New York and we met there.  And what was so interesting, Cardinal [William Henry] Keeler, who is the archbishop here in Baltimore, was on his way to Rome for the canonization and he saw us there.  So you know that was a great, great moment for him.  So we went there, we got there and they had the identification tags for us to wear.  They had scarves with her picture on it to wear.  And I tell you, there were a lot of people there for the canonization.
Story_ID: 191976
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did many come from her--the Sudan also [for the canonization of Josephine Bakhita]?
Speaker 1: Sudan, yes.  They had the president of Sudan [Omar al-Bashir] was there.  This youth choir was there.  And then a number of sisters from around the world were there because here this was a religious order [Daughters of Charity of Canossa] and one of your sisters is being canonized as a saint, so you know they're gonna be there.
Speaker 2: And this was the first black?
Speaker 1: The first black woman to be canonized a saint.  The difference is, people say well there were some more saints before her.  I said yes, but they were not canonized, they were declared saints by the pope, and there's a big difference because right now there's one from Baltimore [Maryland] who's been recommended to be a saint.  And you have--there's a procedure you go through and it's not just a matter well you're a saint.  You've got to go through and there are miracles that have to be attributed to your sainthood qualifications.  Anyway, she met all those standards and was canonized.  And they had the canonization Mass out in Saint Peter's Square [Vatican City].  It poured down rain and everybody got soaked, but they stayed there.  And after the Mass was over, and incidentally, there were a lot of government officials there also.  In fact the United States representative to the Vatican [U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See, Lindy Boggs] was there.  And course they had umbrellas and all this.  But anyway after the canonization--well I should back up because the night before the canonization, they had a prayer service for her.  And they had--young people from Sudan sang.  And the Symphony Orchestra of Milan [Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi, Milan, Italy] backed them up, and it sounded just like they were professionals all their lives.  But it was a great program.  They had a little girl that came from Sudan who played the role of Josephine when she was kidnapped.  And it was just a moving experience.  So then we went to the canonization Mass.  After the Mass the next day, we left Rome [Italy].
Speaker 2: Who presided over that Mass?
Speaker 1: The [Saint] Pope [John Paul, II].  The Pope presided over that.  And I can tell you he enjoyed that Sudanese choir.  They were great.  So the next day we packed up and we started moving north of Rome to all the places that she had visited and worked.  And it was so interesting because one of the pers- she worked with young people.  And one of the young people that she worked with asked her, "You know if you met those people who kidnapped you and made you a slave, what would you do?"  She said, "You know what?  I would kneel down and kiss their hand and thank them because if they had not kidnapped me, I never would have met Christ."  And I tell ya, that is something that really hits you right here in the heart.  So anyway we ended up in a little town called Schio [Italy], which is outside of Milan [Italy].  And the Sudanese youth choir was there and the pastor of my church, Father Edward Miller, had gone along with us to be our chaplain for the pilgrimage.  He celebrated Mass in the place where she was buried and where they have a wax figure of her in front of the altar and the Sudanese choir sang.  And I'm telling you that was a beautiful, beautiful experience.  And right now that's why she's my saint because I was there when she was canonized and we had a Mass in her hometown.  And it's a little town about where I grew up in, and it was there.  When we went to that town, almost every house had a picture of her on the outside, they loved her.
Story_ID: 191977
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit [HM] Dr. [Hilbert] Stanley, about your other involvements now that you have retired from the [National Black Catholic] Congress [NBCC] of--
Speaker 2: Well people know that I've retired.  And there's so many programs that they want me to help them with, like my church.  I'm chairman of the fac- of the pastoral council.  I'm working with NAACP ACT-SO [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics] Program I told you.  I'm chairman of the Morgan State University Foundation.  Just last month I was elected president of the Seton Hill Historic Society [Baltimore, Maryland], which is where I live.  And we are concerned about preserving the history of this neighborhood because [Saint] Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton who was the first American woman to be canonized, worked right here, down the street from where I live.  And there's a park there that used to be a seminary.  And they tore down the semin- seminary and moved north of the city.  And it's now called Saint Mary's Park, and that's a part of our neighborhood.  Also in our neighborhood, there's a building that used to be a Josephite Seminary which served African American parishes.  The seminary moved to Washington [D.C.] and that building was made into a nursing home, but now it's a senior citizen center [Charles R. Uncles Senior Plaza, Baltimore, Maryland].  And that's where the first African American priest was ordained in this country, Father Charles Uncles [sic.].  And we're working with them to try to get them to you know, celebrate him and put a wax figure of him in the [National] Great Blacks in Wax Museum, which is located here in Baltimore [Maryland].  So that's keeping me going.
Speaker 1: So you have a lot of things to--that you can look back on and be very proud of.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And the thing is right now I have almost every day is committed to one of these projects.  So I'm putting as many hours in as I was when I was getting paid, but now I'm working for the Lord.
Speaker 1: Dr. Stanley I have to ask you, are you, are you--do you have a clone?  Are you mentoring others to do your work and show the same passion for it that you have?
Speaker 2: Well I'm trying.  Just like I say when I left the Congress, the person, the young lady who was working with me was the program coordinator.  And when I found out that I could not go to the congress in Chicago [Illinois] this year, I had to notify her and she took over and I've heard reports, my daughter [Denise Stanley] went to the congress.  And several people from my parish, and they thought things went well.  So I feel proud of the fact that I had worked with her to make sure--and I didn't know this was gonna happen.  That I had to--I couldn't say well next month I'm gonna retire.  I just called and said you know I can't go.  And she took over, so that's working.  And that's what I'm trying to do with the NAACP ACT-SO Program.  I just started with them this year and they asked me if I would be the director of development.  That means raising funds for the program.  And I said I'll do it, but I want somebody to be working to learn how to do this because I know I can't do this for a long time.  So--
Story_ID: 191978
Speaker 1: Your career as an educator was quite eventful.  Would you have chosen, looking back, would you have chosen that career again?
Speaker 2: Well if I had to relive, like if you know they say when I come back, I'm gone be--I would be an educator, I really would because I enjoyed it.  I enjoy working with young people.  And now, right now I'm working with my grandson.  I worked with my granddaughter and she finished college at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And when my grandson comes to visit, I take him out to Morgan 'cause I want him to come from Detroit [Michigan] to go to Morgan.  And I'm working with him.  So--and the kids at our church, I try to help.
Story_ID: 191979
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I hope we get to the point where we can accept the fact that we're citizens of America, and that we can have the same powers and privileges of every other person that lives in this country.  Because we talk about democracy, but so many of us have so many bad experiences from slavery on up, that we don't many times feel comfortable.  But that's what I hope we achieve.
Story_ID: 191980
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: Right now I tell you the thing that stands out the most is our Mother of Africa Chapel [Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Washington, D.C.].  Because my daughter [Denise Stanley] has been there, my son [Guy Stanley] has been there, my granddaughter, my daughter-in-law.  And they feel proud about it.  And I think that's something, the fact that one of my students has been appointed to the House of Delegates here in the State of Maryland.  I think that to me are examples of things that I had a small role in, and I feel proud that I did it.
Speaker 1: And who would that person be?
Speaker 2: This is Delegate Marshall Goodwin who was appointed to replace the chairman of the delegate house, the House of Delegates' appropriations committee.  He died recently and this young man was appointed to be his replacement.
Story_ID: 191981
Speaker 1: What values do you consider most important and why?  What values?
Speaker 2: Well the fact right now that I'm still here, living and able to contribute something to the community and to my church.  Because I had an experience where I almost passed, and I keep telling people that I prayed to the good Lord and I prayed that Saint Josephine Bakhita would walk with me and I'm healthy.  And that's the big value I have right now.
Story_ID: 191982
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Whatever comes from their heart.  Don't just try to make news that I did this.  But if you feel sincere that you can say something good about me, please do because I think the family that I leave here would appreciate that.
Story_ID: 191983
Speaker 1: What message or lesson do you have for your children [Guy Stanley and Denise Stanley], grandchildren, the world?
Speaker 2: Work hard, work hard, set objectives that are attainable and work toward that and not, you know so oftentimes we try things and the first time we stumble, we quit.  I say get up, continue.
Story_ID: 191984
Speaker 1: And why [HM] Dr. [Hilbert] Stanley, do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Well I think it's important for people to have the experience of seeing that some people have been successful at doing this and this and this.  And because we're recognizing African Americans who have been coming through such hard situations have achieved.  I think it says to others that I can do it too, and I'm gonna try to do it and work hard at it.
Story_ID: 191985
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well I want my granddaughter to keep working, she's doing a good job now.  My grandson, he spends a couple of weeks with me each summer and he knows what I'm pushing.  And I, I just want to be an example to them and not just tell them things to do.  I want them to see what I do and I think it's easier to follow.
Story_ID: 191986
Speaker 1: Okay that was taken in Easton, Maryland at the home of my grandmother [Clara Stanley] who's sitting in the center of the buil- of the picture.  My mother [Emma Magee Stanley Lewis] is sitting to her left.  My sister [Jewell Stanley Duggins] is sitting to her right, and my daughter [Denise Stanley] is to the right of my sister, and my son [Guy Stanley] is standing in the back.  And then on the right side over my daughter's head is my sister's son.
Speaker 2: And this is your mom.
Speaker 1: That's my grandmother in the center.
Speaker 2: Her name?
Speaker 1: Clara Stanley.  My mother is sitting on the left of her, Emma Stanley.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was taken just out--in front of my house.  That's me with my grandson and that was when he was about two years old.  So that's been about ten years ago.
Speaker 2: That is me when our choir went to Italy to sing at a papal audience.  I went to the home of Saint Bernardine [of Siena], who was the saint after which our church is named, and that was a store we went where they had a plate showing the symbol of Saint Bernadine.
Speaker 1: That is a picture of Saint Josephine Bakhita who I spoke about and attended her canonization.  And if you can see up in the top that little red spot with a white piece in there, that's a relic of her.  That's something that she wore.  And the sisters when they put that together, her religious order [Daughters of Charity of Canossa] put that together, that's a relic in there.
Speaker 2: That again is in Italy.  And while we were there with my choir, this was in the 1970s, I met a sister from Africa.  And she was excited to meet us because we were a black parish and she was a black nun.  So we had a short conversation.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me in Italy, and that's the fountain [Trevi Fountain] that was in a movie 'Three Coins and a Fountain' ['Three Coins in the Fountain'].  And every time I've gone there, they've been working on that fountain to keep it modernized.
Speaker 1: This is in Rome [Italy].
Speaker 2: In Rome, yes.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Bishop John Ricard who was the auxiliary bishop here in Baltimore [Maryland], who's now the bishop of Pensacola-Tallahassee [Florida].  He was the president of the board of trustees of the National Black Catholic Congress [NBCC].  And I was serving as executive director.
Speaker 2: This is a picture in Senegal.  We went to a village where there was a family living.  And we got a chance to meet some of the, the family, the father, the mother and the people who lived there.
Speaker 1: This is again that same village where we were.  And those are some of the family members, and this is outside of Senegal.  And they had a lake, they called it the Red Lake [Lake Retba], which was certainly red with red fungal plants that grew.
Speaker 2: Well this is our transportation when we were in Senegal, that bus, and I just happened to be posing beside it as we were getting ready to go on a trip.
Speaker 1: Okay this is a, a picture at the commencement exercise at Morgan State University [Baltimore, Maryland].  [HM] Dr. Earl Richardson is the president, and I'm there and Dr. Par- [HM] Ben Carson.  And the other gentleman was a speaker.  And I'd have to pull out the program to get his name, but that was on commencement day.
Speaker 2: This is a part of the group from my parish that went on the trip to Rome when the choir went and sang at one of the papal audiences.  And we did a lot of sightseeing in Rome during that time.  And that's one day we had a sightseeing tour.
Speaker 1: This one--I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me as a youngster in Easton, Maryland with one of my neighbors who lived across the street.
Speaker 1: Tell us when, when this was taken.
Speaker 2: Well that looks like I'm about six or seven years old, that would have been like 1939, 1940 with my mother in the center and my sister on the other side.
Speaker 1: And that's me and this would have been about 1932 in Easton, Maryland.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 1: Okay that's a picture of my son and his wife, and they were married about fourteen years ago in Detroit, Michigan.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me.  I was probably about twelve or thirteen years old.  My sister and then in the middle the young baby is one who lived across the street from us in Easton, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay that's a princ- picture that was taken when I was principal at Lake Clifton High School [later, Lake Clifton Eastern High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  And they came up with this program where they would put pictures in the rings, the class rings.  And that would have been in the 1980s.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of the identification badges we had when we were at the canonization of Saint Josephine Bakhita.  And what they do is have flags around her picture showing the countries where the sisters of the religious order, the Daughters of Canossa, were serving.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my daughter in the middle, my granddaughter on the right side and me.  That was probably taken about maybe six or seven years ago.  Oh, that was taken here in Baltimore.
