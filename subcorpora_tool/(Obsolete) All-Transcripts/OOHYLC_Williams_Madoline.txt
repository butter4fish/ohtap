So let   s start by having you tell us when and where you were born.  Williams I was born in 1915, February 26.  Finchum And where?  Williams Down at Ceres, Oklahoma, which is just a little north of Red Rock.  Finchum And did you have brothers and sisters?  Williams I had two sisters, no brothers. My oldest sister passed away at seventy-two  and the other one at eighty-six.  Finchum Wow, so did you ever think you   d make it to 100?  Williams No, but I   m trying now to catch up to Zella, the lady that grew up in the  same town that I did, in Red Rock. She lived to be 106, and John says,  my second son, says I can beat 107. So I said,    I   ll work on it.     Finchum (Laughs) Good for you. What did your parents do for a living?  Williams Carried the mail and just done a little bit of everything, mechanic work,  and I was my daddy   s mechanic. I worked at Tinker Field, and I   ve  done a little bit of everything, beauty shop work and got my beauty  5  operator   s license, graduated from high school in Red Rock. So here I  am here.  Finchum What year did you graduate?  Williams Nineteen thirty-five. As I say, Zella worked at the telephone company,  then I worked at the telephone company. She worked at the post office,  then I worked at the post office. She was up here and here I am up here.  Finchum That   s your sister?  Williams No. That was Zella   used to be Tanksley when we grew up, but she  married and her name was Sullivan.  Finchum So a good friend.  Williams Yes.  Bishop She lived to be over 100 right?  Williams She was 106, so I   m trying to catch her. (Laughter)  Finchum So can you describe the house that you grew up in?  Williams Well we grew up in just an ordinary little wooden frame house. As I  say, we had a barn out here and we had a pet dog. My dad was a  mechanic and I was his helper. I worked at Tinker Field.  Finchum Doing what?  Williams Worked at Tinker Field.  Finchum What did you do at Tinker?  Williams Run a lathe, run a turret lathe   Made parts.  Finchum When did you do that?  Williams Oh that was back in   whenever the war was going on.  Finchum In the    40s?  Williams Yeah.  Finchum So how was the house heated when you were growing up?  6  Williams Mainly with coal or wood. We chopped wood and carried coal or  whatever.  Finchum Did it have indoor plumbing?  Williams Yes, finally. We used to pump water, but finally they got a hydrant and  we got running water.  Finchum That was a happy day, wasn   t it?  Williams Every day   s a happy day. Every day   s a better day.  Finchum Do you remember getting electricity on the farm?  Williams I wasn   t   they would   ve had electricity in town. We weren   t on the  farm very long. We was in Red Rock when I grew up and went to  school from the primary right on through to the twelfth grade.  Finchum Were all twelve grades in the same school? Was the first through the  twelfth grade all in one building?  Williams The building was up on top of a hill and it was a brick building.  Finchum Would you go from the first grade to the twelfth grade?  Williams Yes, all the way through high school.  Finchum Okay, and what was your favorite subject?  Williams Oh, we had arithmetic, and English, and spelling, everything   history.  Finchum And what did you plan to do?  Williams Oh, I didn   t plan. I just lived each day.  Finchum And did you get married?  Williams I got married twice. I married to Helen   s dad  in 1948 in Oklahoma  City . He run the grocery store and I gave him money and he said,     You   re going to give me that?    I said,    Yeah,    and then I helped him  in the grocery store. Then we separated because he got to drinking and  wouldn   t take care of business, so I separated.  Then I married an Indian man, Frank Williams,  in 1956 in Oklahoma  City . He was a barber. I took care of him and what have you. He got  started drinking.  7  First, I had Frank, my son. My son is fifty-seven. I said to Frank   s  daddy, I said,    You   re drinking  I separated from the man before  because it was         Well, I can do different     So he walked out. So we  got a divorce, but I kept the name of Williams because I called out to  the Capitol and got Frank put down at school at Ardmore, because he  was running around with kids that would get him in trouble, and there  wasn   t anything I could do about it. So  Carl Albert, a politician in the  1960s  at the Capitol says,    Put him in school down at Ardmore,    and I  did. He, like I say, thanks me today.  Finchum You   re a pretty strong woman.  Williams Well, I   m just thankful I   m here. As I say, God takes better care of us,  and you better believe it, than you can yourself. You can do what you  do, but when you   ve done all you can do, God does the rest. We   re his  children.  Finchum Was church important when you were growing up?  Williams Yes. We went Baptist and Christian, both of them. So anyway, (laughs)  I   m here.  Finchum Did your mother have a big garden?  Williams Sometimes.  Finchum Would she can?  Williams Once in a while. We had a cellar. We went to the cave when it stormed.  Finchum And would she make your clothes?  Williams Yes. My mom was a wonderful sewer and she crocheted, and I do too.  Finchum She taught you how. Would she buy patterns or make her own?  Williams Would she what?  Finchum Make her own patterns?  Williams Yes, I know she did a beautiful job. She kept me in clothes.  Finchum Okay, and you had a sister that was older?  8  Williams My oldest sister, Helen, was about six years older than I was. She  passed away at seventy-two, and the other sister was only three years  older than me. She passed away at eighty- eight .  Finchum So you were the baby?  Williams Yes.  Finchum Did you have chickens, and cows, and that sort of thing?  Williams Yes, we had chickens and a cow, but not too long.  Finchum Did you have to milk?  Williams I didn   t, Mom milked.  Finchum And who killed the chickens?  Williams Mom cut the head off the chicken and dressed it, took the feathers off of  them, cooked it.  Finchum And what were holidays like as a young child?  Williams Christmas was wonderful. We had everything. We hung up our socks.  (Laughs)  Finchum And what would they put in them?  Williams Oh, we had dolls and toys   well, just a little bit of everything that they  had back then.  Finchum And you got married in    35 you said, the first time. No, that   s when you  graduated from high school     Williams I was married a little later than that I think, the first time, because I  graduated, I think, around    35.  Finchum I   m getting my dates mixed up. Yes, that was during the Depression.  What can you tell me about that?  Williams Yes.  Finchum Do you have any memories from that time period?  Williams Yes, it was hard to get anything. Everything was cheap. You used to  pay a dime for a loaf of bread, now it   s a dollar something. We paid  9  anywhere from ten, to fifteen, twenty cents for a loaf of bread. Now it   s  a dollar and over.  Finchum Do you remember rationing?  Williams Yes.  Finchum Your husband worked for a grocery store. So  I thought  you might  have had to handle the rations.  Williams I always had a good day.  Finchum So you lived in Red Rock. Did you always live in Red Rock, until you  came here?  Williams I   ve never lived any place else but either Red Rock or right here or in  Oklahoma City. I moved to Oklahoma City when I worked at Tinker  Field and when I   well, worked several places. Anyway, I was living in  Oklahoma City when I moved up here. I was living out on Ann Drive.   I lived in Oklahoma City for sixty years.   Finchum Were your parents born in Oklahoma?  Williams No.  Finchum Where did they come from?  Williams Dad come from Missouri and Mother from Kentucky.  Finchum And they came to Oklahoma with their families why? Do you know?  Williams They were here in Oklahoma.  Finchum Did they come with one of the land runs? Your grandparents?

I get them every morning usually between seven thirty and  eight. Like this morning they were a little later, and I chased the girl  down and I got my pills. Then my second son and daughter came and  brought me back to my room then took me down to exercise. We went  the other way around, so here I am. And as I say at ten o   clock, and it   s  ten-fifteen now, we   re supposed to see the foot doctor.  Bishop I want to know   what was wartime like?  Williams Same old thing like it is today.

Williams He played it anytime. He had his own trunk that he kept things in and  you don   t touch it. (Laughter)  Finchum So if he played the banjo would people dance?  Williams No, but Dad took us to dances and we square-danced, one-step, two-step,  whatever.  Finchum Even when you were married did you still do that?  Williams No. Frank didn   t dance and her daddy, he didn   t dance either. In fact, he  was doing good to drive his truck and get his groceries to sell   to re-sell.  Bishop And you had children a little later in life.  Williams As I say, I had my daughter and then I had my son.  Bishop How old were you when you had your daughter and son?

Widner Yeah.  16  Williams And he drives an eighteen-wheeler. As I say, he brought me those  (gestures to flowers) for my birthday and Mother   s Day and told me  how much he loved me and how thankful he was.  Finchum So how did you celebrate your 100th?  Williams With my daughter right here just like always. Just like being here with  you. As I say, it   s time to go see the foot doctor right now.  Finchum I   ve noticed got lots of cards around the room, a lot of birthday cards.  Williams Yes, I   ve got over 100.  Finchum Wow. That   s pretty cool.

Williams Yes, I can do the two-step. (Moves feet)  Widner Her daddy called square-dances. He called square-dances and played  the banjo.  Williams Yes, Daddy called for square-dances. I believe in angels. I believe in  God because he does take better care of you than you do yourself, and  you better believe it, because the traffic gets bad out there. As well as  the storms get bad.  Bishop Now you said you used to go to the cave when it stormed. Can you tell  us about that?  17  Williams That was at Red Rock and we used to have storms that uprooted trees  and things. Mother always took us down to the cellar and then when it  was over we got out, just like now.  Finchum Was Red Rock a pretty good sized town?  Williams No, it was just about 400 or 500 people.

Finchum Did he use the horses to pull the threshing machine?  Williams No. They used tractors.  Finchum Okay.  19  Williams They used horses when they was out there getting the bales of hay,  things like that. Sometimes they had tractors, but most of the time they  had horses.  Finchum Were the streets in town paved?  Williams No, not at that time. They paved later, the paving company, but it   s  usually not concrete, usually blacktop.
