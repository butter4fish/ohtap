Speaker 1: Okay, my name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Neculai-
Speaker 2: Burghelea.
Speaker 1: --yeah, Burghelea.  Observing is Janae Bert [ph.] and Scott Stearns.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: It's Audrey, A-U-D-R-E-Y, Smaltz, S-M-A-L-T-Z.
Speaker 1: And now, do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: Yes, Lavinia, L-A-V-I-N-I-A.
Speaker 1: All right, and can you tell us now--
Speaker 2: I very rarely use it though.
Story_ID: 128526
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind the name Smaltz?
Speaker 2: Smaltz, yes I would say that there--I don't know how big the story.  I didn't question my father too thoroughly.  But my father [Raymond Bailey Smaltz] was German, American Indian, and of course African American.  Now how much and what the percentages were I have no idea but he was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in an area called Germantown, a little section, like we all have sections in various cities.  And I didn't know his father, my grandfather on my father's side and I didn't know the grandmother.  I did see pictures of my grandmother and Smaltz was the way he was told it was spelled from his mother.  But then Pennsylvania was the very first state to have birth certificates and it seemed to me that there was a birth certificate and it said Smeltz, S-M-E-L-T-Z.  So thank God, you know somebody said Smaltz and not Smeltz.  But when I went to Germany I saw a lot of Smaltz, so it's a German name and I never really went any further than that.  I love it cause I say Smaltz, I like to say it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we don't have any idea if, you know who the--well whether--
Speaker 2: Was--my grandfather--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --was a Smaltz, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it's just, all I know it's German and when I went to Germany, I went to Cologne, went to Frankfurt.  I, I'd see the name everywhere.  It was not common but it wasn't unusual.  But it is unusual in the New York area and all over because I use to, when I traveled a lot, I use to go look in the phone book, I could very rarely found a, you know very rarely find Smaltz.  But now the family has really gone big.  And my father was the only child so then I had three brothers and my three brothers begot eight children so there's a lot of Smaltz out there.  Now they're having children so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Smaltzes.
Speaker 1: Have you ever met any African American Smaltz that weren't related to you?
Speaker 2: Never.  I never met a Smaltz other than my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was a John Smaltz who lived at 1040 5th Avenue and I called him once but he didn't know me and I didn't know him.  But you know to live at 1040 5th Avenue and Jackie Onassis lived uh--no, 1035 5th Avenue and Jackie Onassis lived 1040, I figured ooh, let me check him out, but I didn't know him.  I was gonna go visit but I didn't.
Story_ID: 128527
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is June 2nd, 1937, and my place of birth, the county is Manhattan in the village of Harlem, in New York, New York, Harlem USA.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what is your occupation at this--?
Speaker 2: Self-employed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 128528
Speaker 1: An entrepreneur.  I've been in business for myself for twenty-seven and half years, it's exciting.  I'm in fashion.  I produce fashion shows, fashion videos and fashion shoots.  But most importantly I came up with a niche business of backstage management where we manage fashion shows for various designers, various retail organizations, manufacturers, it's very exciting.  It's a passion I've always had and you know to be able to work, love what you do, have fun when you're doing it and then make a decent living, what more could you ask for?  I'm blessed.
Speaker 2: Okay, and the name of your organization?
Speaker 1: The Ground Crew, and I got that name because many years ago in Harlem [New York] at Convent Avenue Baptist Church at 141st Street and Convent Avenue--no, 145th Street and Convent Avenue, it's a big church called Convent Avenue Baptist Church.  And in the early, mid-sixties [1960s], I'd say mid-sixties [1960s], the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] spoke there one evening.  Whether it was a Wednesday evening or Tuesday evening I, I can't remember.  And we were sitting on the front row and--because we knew Dr. King and he spoke that evening about the big 747 plane.  And this huge plane had just come about and he said, well how do you take care of such a huge plane?  You know there's the pilot, the co-pilot, the engineer but what about all the invisible people, the people that you don't see?  The people that clean the plane, the people that service the plane, the people that make certain the plane takes off, all those invisible people, that's the ground crew.  And he did that whole story or preaching, maybe it wasn't preaching but he just did this whole talk on the ground crew.  Well that stuck my mind and so when I started my business, I didn't know, it hit me, The Ground Crew.  We would be those invisible people who make things happen, hair, make-up, stylists, assistant stylists, directors, producers, runners, callers, dressers, steamers, pressers, tailors, you name it, to make a fashion show possible.  And so hence, The Ground Crew.  We're in--we're trademarked and, and I love when people say, The Ground Crew, you know, it's The Ground Crew.  Or sometimes they just say Ground Crew and that's how I got the name.
Speaker 2: Well, that's beautifully conceived.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm telling you, just thinking about how you, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean just thinking about the whole concept of how things get done and the people it takes to get anything done, you know, yeah that's something.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Well--
Story_ID: 128529
Speaker 1: We'll talk more about it when we get to the career part of this, but what is today's date?

Speaker 1: Okay.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at Teachers College here in New York City and that's a part of Columbia University [New York, New York].  I think it's part of Barnard [College, New York, New York], you know, Teachers College on 121st Street between Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway.  So we're in Harlem, far as I'm concerned, we're in Harlem.  This is my kind of town.
Story_ID: 128530
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now before we get into depth, we ask like five lightweight questions and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: No, I really don't.  I love--look at me, I love all foods.  Favorite?  I don't know, fried chicken.  It's not really my favorite.  Hot apple pie, wow, lemon meringue pie without the meringue.  I love lemon, anything lemon.  But it's, I wouldn't say it's favorite.  I love collard greens, oh gosh.  No, I don't have a favorite.  Look at me, I love food.
Speaker 1: Okay well--
Speaker 2: It's interesting.  Good question.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?  Or do you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yellow.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: I love yellow.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: New York [City], all the seasons.  And I really like the rain.  And it's rainy today because I always tell people, it's raining but it's good for your skin.  Not for your hair but for your skin.  I love, I love to experience cold, cold weather.  I like hot weather--no, I really don't like hot weather, not too hot, I have power surges.  The hot weather can sometimes--I can't get cool but in cold weather, I can get warm.  I like all the seasons.  Spring is beautiful.  You know to see the cherry blossoms if you go to Washington, D.C, you know to see the leaves growing on trees, to see growth happening, that's pretty.  Spring, so I guess spring.  I like spring, yeah okay, spring.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Wow, no.  I like to travel.  Favorite?  I mean, my--the last spot I've been to would be my favorite, so the last spot was the south of France, the Cote d'Azur.  That's my favorite cause I was just there recently.  And now I'm on my way to Singapore so when I get there, I'll probably say that's my favorite destination.  In America, I love New Orleans [Louisiana].  Ooh, I love New Orleans and I love Bel Air [Los Angeles], California and I like Upstate New York, the Adirondacks.  I really don't have a favorite.  I just love a lot of places.  A favorite?  Wow.
Speaker 1: Okay, the last question in this series is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I say it every day, interesting.  "Divine love always has met and always will meet every human need," Mary Baker Eddy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's so deep.  And I say it before every meal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And everybody learns it who hangs out with me 'cause they like it.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 128531
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother's full name is Rebecca, R-E-B-E-C-C-A, Dora, D-O-R-A, Capers, C-A-P-E-R-S.  And then she married my dad so we'll add Smaltz, S-M-A-L-T-Z.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth, March 12th, 1900.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Hilton Head, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what do you know about her--the ancestors on her side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what do you know about them?
Speaker 2: Not too far back.  I know she had Indian in the family cause all of her sisters when they were alive, they, they looked Indian.  They had a lot of red, dark tones and they had all long beautiful hair.  I can't tell by me but my family had long beautiful hair.  They were tall and they were very stately.  All of the kids were tall, I think of her sisters.  And her--then she, there were some half-sisters and brothers or step sisters whatever they called them then, they were shorter.  But basically her immediate sisters, they were all tall.  And I didn't know my grandmother.  I did not know her mother and her mother's name is Lavinia, which is my middle name, Lavinia Robinson and she married James Capers.  So I didn't know them but they, they lived between Daufuskie, South Carolina and Hilton Head [South Carolina].  Those are small islands in South Carolina.  And they lived there for many years and then they moved to Savannah, Georgia which is not far from Hilton Head.  And then my mother's mother died when she was very young, she was only nine.  And so my mother's aunt, which would have been my grandmother's sister, we called her Aunt Essie [ph.], she really looked like an Indian, you know the way we see American Indians.  Aunt Essie raised my mother and they moved to Boston, Massachusetts.  And Aunt Essie was married to a Mr. Jacobs, Jake--no, Jacob Griffin [ph.], Jacob Griffin and they raised my mother from nine until she was about seventeen or eighteen.  And then finally mother said it was time for her to leave because then Aunt Essie, as we called her, had started having children and my mother said the house got kind of crowded.  So it was time for her to leave Boston and she came to New York [City] and that's about all I can remember, she got--she came to New York.  So she came to New York when she was about nineteen or twenty I believe yeah, about that age, so from Hilton Head, Hilton Head to Boston, Boston to New York.
Story_ID: 128532
Speaker 1: Okay now, what did she [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] do in New York [New York] when she--?
Speaker 2: When she came to New York she started working at John Wanamaker [Wanamaker's].  Now that was "the" department store.  I mean it was the, what they called the carriage trade, only the top of the line you know, very wealthy women and men shopped at John Wanamaker.  It's no longer there.  So when she went to John Wanamaker she had one or two choices for black women in 1920 let's say, the Roaring Twenties.  Black women had a choice of either working in the bathrooms or operating an elevator.  Because my mother was tall and pretty, guess what job she got?  She was the elevator operator and then she became the elevator starter and she worked there for many years.  And the reason why I say she worked there for a long time because she got married in 1924 and then her first child wasn't born until she was nineteen--till 1928.  So it seemed like she worked there a long time at John Wanamaker.  I never heard her talk of any other job.  Now she had an eighth grade education but we did find a beau--a diploma where she had gone to beauty culture school in Boston [Massachusetts].  So she had taken a beau, but she didn't like being--no.  She didn't like doing hair.  That's what--she hated it.  And she had lots of hair.  I mean--and her hair was kinky, very kinky.  And I have pictures of her which I didn't bring with me but I had a pic--I have a picture of her and she would say before the straightening comb, before Madam C.J. Walker came out with the straightening comb, she said that was a blessing when Madam C.J. Walker could straighten that hair.  But she said they used to put her hair on, on the ironing board and press it as best they could.  They would press hair.
Speaker 1: With an iron?
Speaker 2: Yeah with an iron, yeah that's how they would--you know you'd go like this, I guess.  She used to show me but that was her job.  She was at John Wan--and she loved that job, she loved it.  And then when Raymond was born, my older brother, he was born in December of 1928, then she stopped working.  After that then my next brother was born, Kenneth, so he was--thirteen months difference in their ages.  So he was born January, the first week in January of 1930, and Raymond was born the first week in December, 1928.  So you know just a year, they're thirteen months apart.  And then I came along much--I think I came along by eight or nine years later.  So as far as work for her was--she stayed at home.  My father [Raymond Bailey Smaltz] worked and then she raised the family and people say, well what else did she do?  I said play numbers.  She was always home.  I didn't have a key until I was about twenty eight years old.  I mean she was always home.  And I never had a baby sitter.  She took me everywhere with her.  She was quite a woman.  She was very funny.  She loved to gamble.  She loved to play cards.  That's all she did.  She would just figure out what the number was going to be.  She was very fortunate, very lucky, play the numbers.  I don't play numbers, I don't play lotto.  I play solitaire on my computer.
Story_ID: 128533
Speaker 1: Okay, well let me go back a little bit to Hilton Head [South Carolina].  Are there any--now Hilton, the area around Hilton Head is one of the--those are one of--that's one of the most African I guess of the areas--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the United States for Black people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A lot of African holdovers there, and then Gullah Country and all of that.
Speaker 2: Yes, Gullah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) so are there any stories about your mother's [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] people from those days?
Speaker 2: Well you, but you know what happened about fifteen years ago or less, I went to Hilton Head.  A friend of mine had a timeshare in Hilton Head and I forgot the plantation, I can't remember the plantation.  They call, each section had a plantation name so her plantation had a particular name and I said, wow that sounds so familiar.  So that Sunday I said I want to go to church.  I want to go to a Baptist church.  I go to this church and I sit down in the church, a little church, cute, and I sit there and I said, this place sounds familiar, it feels familiar, it just something from--so I go up to one of the elders in the church and I said, did you know a Dora Capers?  Did you know the Robinson family, Minnie Williams, did you--I'm naming--they said yes.  And the man looked at me, he said are you Dora's--?  He thought I was my mother.  He just like--he thought I was my mother and I'm--and I just hugged him and I kissed him and he knew my family.  And he remembered my father, it was, it was so beautiful.  I said oh my--then my mother had a half-sister and I said, well there's a woman--she probably still lives here and he said yes, I know where to find her.  He gave me her address.  I went over to visit her and believe it or not her name was Dora also, Doty.  And believe it, (unclear) Doty.  Anyway, it was strange because she used to come visit us in Harlem and I hadn't--she was much younger than my mother.  And my mother said she was--they were half-sisters you know you never question those days.  There's your half-sister, whatever.  I went to visit her, she was so happy to see me.  I was, I was thrilled and I didn't know what she wanted.  I asked her what she wanted and she wanted, she wanted I think a can opener or something simple and I went and bought it and brought it back to her.  It was, it was so--and my mother had been dead many years.  My mother died in fact thirty-one years ago today.  And so this talk to her was wonderful.  What a wonderful memory.  But I just picked out this church, I don't know.  The church--I just said let's go to this Baptist church cause I knew my mother was Baptist, I knew that.  Even when we were growing up she did not go to church.  She sent me to church but she didn't go to church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What a connection!  Now when did you go there?
Speaker 2: It was fabulous.
Speaker 1: When did you go there?
Speaker 2: I, if I really wanted to concentrate on it, I could tell you exactly because I was with my girlfriend, Terri Springer-Walker.  I was with Terri and she invited me to come to her condominium, you know timeshare, beautiful house, and I said fine.  So I met her.  We met in Savannah [Georgia] and then we rented a car and then we drove to Hilton Head.  And it was something about Hilton Head and I was there as a child.  I was there very--my mother, we'd go there every summer to Hilton Head, Daufuskie and Savannah and Fort Screven, Georgia.  We'd go to all--and Tybee [Island] Beach [Georgia], it was gorgeous.  And the family had you know land there and I was, as a child, I played there cause you know it's far different from Harlem, you know the city, and I liked it.  Every summer we went 'cause I was--my mother always took me to the South.  I--she never took me to--I never went to camp.  I always wanted to go to camp.  She wouldn't let me go to camp.  Anyway, yeah so it was--we loved it.  It was beautiful.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Beautiful--
Story_ID: 128534
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us his full name and spell it (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah my father's full name was Raymond Bailey [Smaltz].  Raymond, R-A-Y-M-O-N-D, Bailey, B-A-I-L-E-Y, Smaltz, S-M-A-L-T-Z.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place--?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is February the 10th, 1898.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what do you know about the ancestors on his side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: That's the problem, he didn't talk much.  He had a cousin named Washington and Cousin Emmanuel Washington [ph.] was his first cousin on his mother's side.  That was the only family that I knew of and it seemed that he had family--I would try to piece it together but I never really went into it thoroughly.  He had family in Beaufort, South Carolina.  And it seemed--
Speaker 1: That's very close to, yeah very (unclear).
Speaker 2: Beaufort, right.  So he left Philadelphia.  There were some women in Philadelphia, white women who started a school who took colored kids, you know colored children to John Small School on an island in Beaufort.  You know there are a lot of islands out there.
Speaker 1: That was James (unclear)?
Speaker 2: John Small was the name of the school I think 'cause I went to see it.  I went to Beaufort and it seems that that's where he and my mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] met.  They met in South Carolina some kind of way.  I don't know how.  Anyway that's how they met there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: St. Helena's Island, that's it.
Speaker 1: St. Helena [South Carolina].
Speaker 2: St. Helena's Island, now how close that is to Hilton Head, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: They're all close.
Speaker 2: They're all close so they're all down there, Gullah, Gullah, Gullah.  And I went down there a couple of times to Beaufort cause my family, my--as I said Emmanuel Washington, he had a lot of property down there and that was my only connection with my father's family, was one cousin named Emmanuel Washington who was older than my father, and my mother loved him.  He was very good to my mother and father when they were very young and then he was, oh he was very good to me, just nice, a wonderful man, married a wonderful woman.  I think they had one child and that's all.  I just know Cousin, I called him Cousin Emmanuel.  His name was Emmanuel Washington and he and my father both worked at the post office together.  And he was--but he was very clever.  My father never made a lot money.  Emmanuel made a lot of money.  How I don't know, cause they both worked at the post office.  I think daddy told me that Emmanuel used to loan money.  He always had money.  He'd loan money to co-workers and then I then he got a quarter on everything you borrowed.  You know, if you borrowed a dollar, you got to pay him back a dollar and a quarter so you could make a lot of money like that.  He was a loan shark.  That's what daddy said.  Yeah, it was funny, yeah.
Story_ID: 128535
Speaker 1: But before daddy [Raymond Bailey Smaltz] went to the post office he--now I don't whether this is true, they--this is legend, I don't know.  Daddy was tall, I mean gorgeous, gorgeous, I mean really tall, handsome, thin, not heavy, about one hundred and eighty pounds.  And he was a dresser, out of this world, could he dress.  I mean he always wore a suit with a vest and a pair of pants, a shirt and a tie, every day.  I don't think he was ever really casual, casual, was always just so.  Handkerchief and he, he'd make his own handkerchiefs.  He'd go to Archer Street, buy the fabric, linen and then hand roll the handkerchiefs.  And till this day, I have to have handkerchiefs.  I like men handkerchiefs, big ones.  Anyway daddy was really gorgeous and he married my mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz].  She had to be married to this gorgeous man, she told me cause how she wanted pretty children, anyway neither here nor there.  But they say--I didn't hear it from her but from other people that he was a pimp.  He would--had some girls on the street.  I said whoa!  He never said this to me but I heard it you know.  And I'm not surprised.  And they were white women cause he was very fair.  Very fair, gorgeous hair you know, as we would say good hair.  You know you've heard that expression wasn't kinky (laughter).  That's funny.  My father hated that when I say that too.  I thought about that.  Anyway, then he was a tailor and he worked at--he could sew.  He was a hand sewer.  He, I guess he worked a machine but he worked at the, one of the finest dry cleaning establishments in New York City.  I think it's called--I don't remember the name right now as I'm talking to you but it, it was a big--you know, where the carriage trade brought their clothes to be dry cleaned and fixed and repaired.  He did that for a while but mostly he gambled and my mother you know, got upset because sometimes he'd have a lot of money and sometimes he wouldn't have a lot of money.  So she told him he had to find a real job because you know she was having babies now and so he got a job at the post office.  So she said a little bit regular is better than a whole lot every now and then.
Story_ID: 128536
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your father [Raymond Bailey Smaltz] got a steady job at the post office?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: He stayed there until he retired.  They, they--he stayed there until the last day in February of his seventieth birthday.  And I'm sorry I wasn't able to give him a real fabulous job but he did get other job.  Mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] made him leave the house 'cause she couldn't deal with him.  He would find jobs on Wall Street.  They used to walk--he's a walker 'cause he used to take me on long walks.  So he would get jobs taking securities from one bank to another bank or one investment firm.  That was nice.  That lasted just so he'd be out of the house, give him something to do.  They were married almost fifty years, you know fabulous.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where did the family live?  Where did you live in--?
Speaker 2: Well I was born in Harlem [New York] and so I would tell everybody, I know I belong to my mother and father 'cause I was born in the Harlem River Houses at 2651 7th Avenue on the second floor in apartment 2A.  And I was the first baby the doctor delivered.  Yeah, my father was right there.  My father was there for--when all of us were born, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now that's unusual for those days, really unusual.
Speaker 2: We were all born at home, all born--in fact Mickey [Kenneth Smaltz], the second son, I think my father really brought him into this world because the doctor was late.  They--some founding hospital that you know the doctors came and helped you deliver the babies, I don't know.  And Mickey's birthday is January the 8th, but I really think it's January the 7th, cause--they said the 8th, cause that's what the birth certificate said the 8th.  But daddy brought him in ahead of time.  I know--
Speaker 1: Maybe that wasn't unusual for those days.
Speaker 2: No, it was 1930.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about '37 [1937], yeah.
Speaker 2: Hey, yeah, thirty--I was born '37 [1937].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know, I--
Speaker 1: Maybe not.
Speaker 2: I know I belong to my mom.  I use to tease everybody else, you know you're in the hospital, could have been a mix up.  I, you know just 'cause I was fresh.
Story_ID: 128537
Speaker 1: But yeah, we were, we, we were in Harlem [New York, New York] and someone said about what kind of wedding my mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] and father [Raymond Bailey Smaltz] had that was really funny because I have their wedding pictures.  But his picture and her picture, not together, you know a single picture of her and a single picture of him which I didn't bring with me.  And they got married on July 17th, 1924 and they went to the aquarium for their honeymoon on Staten Island [New York, New York].  (Laughter).  Is that hysterical?  They got married--I remember Emmanuel Washington [ph.] was the best man, his cousin and then his wife was--stood up with Doty and another lady, Ms., oh Ms.--I can't think of her name right now.  Everybody's gone, that's a shame.  You don't remember all the names, but they, they were--Carrie Bob [ph.], that's right, Ms. Carrie Bob and Uncle Emmanuel's--Cousin Emmanuel's wife Coreen [ph.].  Coreen, oh it came to me, Coreen, had beautiful names, Carrie and Coreen.  Okay, anyway, then they came home cause my mother said she--they were rooming.  They had a, they had--so Carrie Bob had this huge apartment in Harlem somewhere.  I don't remember exactly where, you know those long apartments and the rooms off to the side.  You know you could walk down a long hall.  And Carrie Bob rented my mother and father a bedroom.  So they had a bedroom and a bath and then they, everybody shared the kitchen.  So they came home from the honeymoon which was in Staten Island at the aquarium and then she said daddy undressed and got dressed again, cause he you know loved clothes and he said he'll be back.  He went out.  It was their honeymoon night.  He went out and she told he didn't show up for three nights.  I said stop it!  You didn't divorce him?  That's major.  That's--you should have divorced him.  She said he was gambling.  There he was, cause that's what he did you know, those poker games go on, on and on and on.  I said you mean to tell me on your wedding night, your husband of almost fifty years walked out and didn't come back for three--and you were still there?  Said, where was I going?  I think that's so funny.  You know young women could learn from that.  They really can.  You know you don't put up with things like that now you know.  Some man doesn't show up for three days that's the end of that.  That's the end of that.  It was funny.  So then they've been married a long time.  In fact she died three months prior to their fiftieth wedding anniversary and I was going to take them to [Las] Vegas [Nevada] cause they had not been to Vegas.  The two of them could really play cards.  They loved cards.  I thought I'd take them to Vegas so they could play cards till they got tired of playing cards.  That was a--they had a nice marriage.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They really, they really did.

Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?  What's the first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: Wow!  The first thing I remember.  I don't know about the first thing.  That's something interesting.  My first childhood memory, hmm, I remember like going to church.  I liked singing.  I liked playing, we had a little courtyard.  We lived in the Harlem River Houses, the very first public housing ever in New York City designed by a black architect.  And we had a little courtyard.  I was always playing in the courtyard digging in the dirt, taking the rocks and moving the rocks around.  And I had lots of friends and we all lived in this little courtyard.  There was June Burgess and there was Eleanor Lawson, Fern Burgess and Emily Beard and the wonderful sisters who lived up on the top floor.  They played piano.  It was wonderful.
Speaker 1: The Harlem River Houses are different in those days (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we knew everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was beautiful.  We knew everybody.
Speaker 1: When people think of projects now they think of (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no we--that, that's not a word you say, project.  We were the Harlem River Houses, the first public housing.  And we were only four stories high.  And some areas of the housing development we were five stories high.  Oh wow, what a beautiful place.  It was unbelievable and it was clean.  And my mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] used to wash, did the laundry on Monday and we had a basement downstairs and you had your own cage to hang up your clothes with, with the ropes.  So you would wash in the big washing room and then on Monday she would hang up her clothes.  And then the lady who washed on Tuesday who used that same bin with us would take her clothes down and she'd hang up her clothes and it went like that.  And you would see bicycles along the wall cause that where you--you didn't keep you bicycle in your house, had your bicycle--and then if you wanted to get into the private cage, you had to know the lock to get in.  And the basements were so incredibly clean.  You could go from 153rd Street all the way around to what they now call The Jungle where they have people play tennis.  Only white folk were playing tennis in those days.  And we used to collect tennis balls.  I used to play a lot.  I had wonderful friends.  I was a little tomboy, I remember that because I had two brothers [Raymond and Kenneth Smaltz] and they taught me how to box and fight.
Speaker 1: Now how many of you is there in all?
Speaker 2: Three.  Three.  Five in the family--we had two bedrooms, a two bedroom apartment.
Speaker 1: You had two older brothers--
Speaker 2: Two older brothers.
Speaker 1: --and your--?
Speaker 2: My mother and father [Raymond Bailey Smaltz].
Speaker 1: You're absolutely the youngest one?
Speaker 2: I'm the baby.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 128539
Speaker 1: And I--my mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] got me a doll every Christmas but I really didn't like dolls.  I, I used to--I had a snake.  I had a frog and I played with the Lionel trains.  My father [Raymond Bailey Smaltz] used to set up my brother's train underneath the bed in the bedroom, in his bedroom cause they had a big bed and that was the tunnel.  And we'd be on the floor and those train--play with those trains.  Ooh, I used to like to play with all--all the things the little boys played with, I played with.  I had dolls but I really didn't play with them.  You know my mother wanted me to play with them but I, I liked--I only rode a boy's bike.  I never had a girl's bike.  Had a boy's bike, I was always tall.  I was the tallest. I remember just being very tall and other memories, just happy memories, just always playing, always having fun.
Story_ID: 128540
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Cooking.  You could smell all kinds of cook, all kinds of food.  And everybody took care of everybody's children.  The sights and sounds, we lived at the upper end of 7th Avenue and at 153rd Street [Harlem, New York], then the street took a sharp left and then a sharp right, cause when you got to 155th Street, there were no more building past 153rd.  So picture the building ending at 153rd and then you just have green grass and then you see the Harlem River was right there and then there was nothing really there except down below.  There was a park and then the Harlem River Bridge.  So for two blocks the cars were moving too fast, coming up 7th Avenue, then there was a sharp left and then a right.  I saw accidents, oh yes.  See, people didn't realize you know in middle of the night you'd hear an accident.  Ooh, there were so many--you know that's interesting that I thought of that when you asked me about the sounds.  Lots of car accidents there.  And you had to be very--my mother wouldn't let you cross the street.  Oh, no you had to wait for an adult who was crossing the street before you could cross the street.  It was dangerous crossing those streets because at 153rd Street you could cross there but you still had to be careful cause those cars are coming up 7th Avenue.  But at 152nd Street, it was dangerous because there's a tunnel that takes you right down to Macombs Place and 8th Avenue.  And so it was the tunnel and then you'd go up 7th Avenue.  You have to see it, it's still there.  And that was a dangerous place too.  The cars were just, you know were moving too fast, people coming out the tunnel, cars going down 7th Avenue, cars going up to 7th, going up the tunnel, out, in the--so I remember that.  But it wasn't noisy.  Oh, and then you had wonderful sounds because I lived right on the, this side of the river, the Harlem River and then on that side of the Harlem River, Yankee Stadium [Bronx, New York].  And so you get all the people going to the Yankee Stadium, they're coming up 7th Avenue, going across the bridge, go to Yankee Stadium and leaving the stadium.  And I remember we--some summer nights we were sitting out there waiting honey because Joe Louis was fighting at Yankee Stadium and we'd see the pretty cars going up you know to the Yankee Stadium, people all dressed up.  Joe Louis would fight, oh that was exciting.  Exciting things were going on.  And then Sugar Ray Robinson use to drive a hot pink convertible Cadillac and you'd see Sugar Ray and he'd wave, you know we'd wave to Sugar Ray.  We'd see a lot of wonderful people.  And one of the most vivid memories I had and we and look up that date, I must have been about eight or nine.  But the president of the United States had died, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  Well I needn't tell you, black folk loved them some Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  It seemed like all of Harlem was crying and we were standing outside in front of our houses and the cortege came up 7th Avenue, was that a sight.  Everybody was crying, ahh--I didn't know why they were crying. I was crying too because my mother was crying.  I was--and his cortege came right up through Harlem, all through Harlem and he was on his way to Hyde Park cause that's where his estate was in Hyde Park.  I remember that well.  Wow.  I was just waving you know.  I was happy and then--until I saw my mother crying.  So we lived in a really chichi area when I think about it because people got all dressed up to do something really exciting at Yankee Stadium.  It wasn't just about baseball.  It was things happening there.  I remember the Jehovah Witnesses use to have conventions there and it was a lot of people going--you know it was always action, action, action.
Speaker 1: Some of the--
Speaker 2: And there were trolley cars too in those days.  We had trolley cars on 155th Street and you, you take a penny and put it in the trolley track and you got a nice shaped penny when you picked it up.  Oh, my mother use to get mad at me, don't do that, you know cause I did everything she said not to do.  And I never got hurt.  I use to try it anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nice memories.
Story_ID: 128541
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay so you would describe yourself as a tomboy--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was a tomboy with long braids.  I had long braids.  Always had two braids over here.  Sometime the braid hanging down here with a bow, two braids, long braids hanging in the back.  Sometimes braided here and then you pick up some more hair and you braid it all down.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you had a lot of fun growing up I take it?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah I did because I would get lost and my brothers [Raymond and Kenneth Smaltz] had to, had to--if sometimes my mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] said, okay, take your sister with you.  Can you imagine?  Take your sister with you.  And then they would take me to the park and they would start playing basketball and then I'd wait till they got really into that game and I'd cut out.  I'm gone.  Then they lost me.  They didn't know where I was.  My mother said, well where is your sister?  Oh, I was someplace, but not far away.  You know I knew I couldn't cross 7th Avenue.  I had to stay on--and another thing, we lived on the riverside.  You know there was the other and there--but we lived, you know you--to live on the riverside, that's the most important side of the Harlem River Houses.  You may want to call them projects, but they weren't.  So those people lived on the other side, but we lived on the riverside cause we had a river view.  No, I used to get lost from my brothers all the time.  It was fun.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: But my father [Raymond Bailey Smaltz] had a whistle for me.  You know they'd whistle.  Everybody knew everybody's whistle.  Audrey, your father is whistling.  You better go--honey, I started running in the direction that my father was whistling.  You better get home, get home (unclear) he was whistling.
Speaker 2: Do you remember what his whistle sounded like?
Speaker 1: Yeah!
Speaker 2: Can you do it?
Speaker 1: I can't whistle.  But like said, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah, dah, dah.  He'd go (attempts whistling).  That was my whistle.  Everybody knew everybody's whistle.  And some mothers could whistle good cause some you know kids I grew up with didn't have fathers.  No, my mother did not whistle.  My father whistled for me.  My mother started screaming like me. I got a big mouth.  She'd scream, where is Audrey?  And everybody looked for you.  The whole neighborhood, stop what you're doing go look for that child.
Speaker 2: It's something that doesn't go on anymore.
Speaker 1: No, that doesn't happen anymore.  You're in somebody's house, somebody's apartment.  We call--we didn't call it apartments, someone's house or someone's home, you didn't say apartments, interesting.  You was in somebody's house doing something, whatever, playing.  You were in Ms. Burgess' house or you were in Ms. Edwards--we liked going to Ms. Edwards cause Ms. Edwards could make biscuits.  Oh, Ms. Edward made the best biscuits.  Joyce and George, they were twins, and Dolores [ph.], wow.  And then there was--I mentioned Fern.  There was Vivian and her sister, Vivian Smith.  Oh wow, great--and I'm still friends with quite a few of those ladies I've just mentioned.  June Burgess and I are still friends.  She just had a seventieth birthday party and I was there.  And I grew up with some wonderful people, yeah, great.

Speaker 1: On the non-riverside?
Speaker 2: Oh he--uh-uh.  We were on the riverside, he lives on the other side.  And Bob Moses took me to his prom at Stuyvesant.  I was about fifteen, um-hmm.  My mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz]--never forget, my mother--I had a strapless--no, no, my dress wasn't strapless.  I had a light blue wonderful halter lace top with a tulle bottom and I had this light blue jacket that matched.  And I had Capezio light blue shoes on cause he was shorter than me.  And then he brought me a corsage that I put on my hand--wrist and then he walked over to my house.  He was all dressed up and he walked over to pick me up and then we went back over cross, across 7th Avenue and he was at 151st Street and they lived on the top floor so his mother who wasn't well at the time could see me.  She wanted to see us together.  I wish I had those pictures.  Ooh, we were sharp.
Speaker 1: Now--

Speaker 2: You know we have some, oh we have some famous people from the Harlem River Houses, did very well.  In fact I've known [HM] Congressman Charlie [Charles B.] Rangel cause he was there in the Harlem River Houses.  He lived there for a while.
Story_ID: 128543
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Now, where did you go to grade school?  What was the name of--?
Speaker 1: I went to P.S. 146.  No, no, P.S. 46 [New York City].
Speaker 2: Forty-Six.
Speaker 1: Now my mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] sent me to P.S. 46 because that was on the hill.  Now the hill--we were living in the valley so the valley would be 7th Avenue and then you could go up the 155th Street viaduct which is still there and when you walked up the viaduct your first avenue would be Edgecombe and after Edgecombe, St. Nicholas and then Amsterdam.  And I went to a school between St. Nicholas Avenue and Amsterdam Avenue on 156th Street which was out of the district.  I was supposed to go to P.S. 90 on 147th Street between 7th and 8th.  Mother didn't want me to go there because only black kids went there.  She wanted me to go to an integrated high school where white and black kids went.
Speaker 2: For grade school?
Speaker 1: Grade--yeah, junior high, elementary school, yeah--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --that's right, elementary, first grade to--that's right, elementary school, P.S. 46.  So she had a friend who lived on St. Nicholas Avenue.  We used her address like I lived there.  That's how I got to P.S. 46.  And there were white and black children in that school, whereas in the other school that was strictly in Harlem [New York] even though that is considered Harlem now.  That was kind of Washington Heights then.  So I went to that school and from that school--I did very well in that school.  I got all kind of awards.  I still have some of those awards, fire department.  I use to draw.  I use to like to draw.
Speaker 2: What--I wondered about that because a lot of people into fashion were artists.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm an--yeah.  I'm a fine artist.  I--
Speaker 2: So you draw (unclear)--?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I went to the High School of Music and Art [New York City] on my art ability.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I majored in art all the way.  That's my love, art.  I collect art now.  Anyway, so we went there and then when we--we graduated from P.S. 46, so then my mother was really upset cause she wanted me to go to Stitt [I.S. 164, New York City], that was at 164th Street and Edgecombe Avenue. That's even more white up there.  Well lo and behold, here I am back in Harlem at Harriett Beecher Stowe [New York City], HBS, better known as "Harlem's Best Studs." That's the title, that's how we got our--oh, it was a tough school.  So I went there but they put me in an advanced class.  I was in Class 7-3, which was for art students.  And I had a wonderful teacher, Ms. Samili [ph.] and she would teach us, those who really were, we were interested in art, she'd give us more of a variety in art. You know how to--with crayons and paint, we did more.  We did a lot.  And I use to do the murals.  I used to do all the murals.  And I'd work--you know pretty, we'd make the school pretty, I use to do that.  And I got my ears pierced.  I remember the girl pierced my ears.  My mother was so mad.
Speaker 2: Cause you did it without your mother's--?
Speaker 1: Of course.  She wouldn't let me wear earrings.  So I had (unclear)--Carolyn Pruitt [ph.], she pierced one in homeroom and then she pierced the other--and we both got demerits but I got my earrings.  My mother wouldn't let me wear earrings so I had to have pierced ears.  I was thirteen years old, it was time for me to wear earrings.  Anyway, so we went to the Harriett Beecher Stowe which really turned out to be A-okay, because there was a teacher there who told, who gave $100.00 every month to twenty deserving students if they wrote an essay about something and I used to get $5.00 a month.  I was one of the twenty students that got five--one of those rich white stu--teachers gave us money.  And we learned how to read the New York Times.  So the school really wasn't that bad, you know.  It was a good school, only black kids in that school.  My mother--so she--it was okay.  So the teachers took a lot of care with us, lots of--
Speaker 2: Was Bob [Robert Parris] Moses (unclear) there?
Speaker 1: No, Bob Moses--no.  Bob Moses went to, he went to the equivalent.  I--he--his equivalent would have been Frederick Douglas on 139th Street.  Yes, Bob went there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay so different grade schools but they fed into the same high (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.  That's right.  We were the girls, you know it was a girls--that's right, that's another thing.  We were a girls' school and Frederick Douglas was a boys' school.  You know they would separate the girls and the boys.
Speaker 2: So they did that in the (unclear)--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm glad you brought that up.  We were a girls' school.  We were a girl--but they called middle school now.  We were junior high school from the seventh grade through the--seventh through the ninth.
Story_ID: 128544
Speaker 1: But what happened, I took this exam for The High School of Music and Art [New York, New York] because I was very talented in art and I--the teachers told me I should take this exam and they prepared me very well.  I'd go to stay after school one or two days a week so I could get my portfolio together and about four or five kids from P.S. 136--and I use to look at High School of Music and Art because I'd be sitting in my classroom at 135th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue and just look up the hill.  There was a park and there was the castle which was The High School of Music and Art.  I use to dream of going there 'cause it was a small school.  And so sure enough I took the exam and I passed and I went to The High School of Music and Art and I started there in the ninth grade.  So they allowed me to graduate but I was really in eighth grade.  They just you know let me walk with the class.  I didn't really graduate.  Then I went right to high school.  So I went to The High School of Music and Art which is a fabulous school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's near City College [of New York, New York City] right, right up (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yes, right the--it's a part of City College now.  And who was there, [Carol] Diahann Johnson, better known as [HM] Diahann Carroll.  Diahann Johnson was there.  I went to school, I was in class with Billy Dee Williams [William December "Billy Dee" Williams, Jr.] He has a twin sister named Loretta.  Peter, Paul and Mary, oh everybody--and this year is going to be the fiftieth anniversary of our graduation and we're all hanging out together.
Speaker 2: Peter, Paul and Mary?
Speaker 1: Right.  That's right we all went to The High School of Music and Art.  Peter Yarrow, wow.  Then from City College--no, from The High School of Music and Art to CCNY [City Colleges of New York] which was right next door you know, dah-dah, buh.
Story_ID: 128545
Speaker 1: Now before we get you there, let's--I wanted to ask you some--about high school.  Now who--did you have a favorite teacher in--teachers in school period from beginning to the end, who were some of your favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Well I had--there was Ms.--no, I guess--Ms. Samili [ph.] was nice.  She was in--
Speaker 1: How do you spell (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.  Ms. Samili.  She was young and pretty, we liked her.  And she was our art teacher and our homeroom teacher.  Then I had a teacher at, in junior high school that I liked too. She was a science teacher.  She was a, an African American woman.  Oh she was fabulous but I can't think of her name right now.  She was wonderful.  And then when I was in elementary school I had a teacher that, I had Ms. Briding [ph.].  I remember Ms. Briding.  I had her for a long time, from maybe the fourth, fifth, sixth grade, Ms. Briding.  She was nice to me.  She was very nice.  And then I had another teacher--I loved when my teachers were black.  You know I had a lot of white teachers, isn't that interesting?  I didn't have a lot of black teachers you know.  I use to--ooh.  When I got a black teacher I got very excited.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I liked them--
Story_ID: 128546
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking about high school.  Now you were at The High School of Music & Art [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: With all these-[HM] Diahann Carroll, Billy Dee Williams--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and his--his sister went there too?
Speaker 2: Yes, he has a twin sister named Loretta.
Speaker 1: Okay, Peter, Paul and Mary and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what did you focus on art basically?
Speaker 2: Art.  In the beginning I was doing, I also did--I was in the chorus, the junior girls' chorus and I was in the senior girls' chorus, but I was always an art major.  But I wanted to be an art and music major and they could me I could not be both.  I was most upset so when I got into my junior year in high school I had to make a decision whether I was going to major in music or major in art and I took art because I couldn't get theory, you know.  Theory and I did not get along.  I mean I didn't know one note from the next and I wasn't about to study now on a--you know and everybody had perfect pitch.  I could sing but I didn't have perfect pitch. I said well I'd better not do that you know since everybody had perfect pitch and they knew every note.  You know they knew F sharp and a B and a B flat and I didn't know that so I just stayed in with art.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's easy, more creative.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now during I guess your tenure in high school you started modeling, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You say you started when you were fifteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did, how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did you get involved with modeling?
Speaker 2: I was always tall, always thin, always loved a lot of clothes.  And everybody said well you should model, you should model, you should model.  So Loretta Williams and Fern Walker, both of those ladies were going to the Ophelia DeVore School of Charm which at that time was called the Laura Dell [ph.] School of Charm, and they were going. My two friends were going to charm school and I said to my mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz], I have to go to charm school with Fern and Loretta.  And my mother said, no and I said well it costs fifty dollars and she said oh, that's a lot of money.  That's a lot of money, fifty dollars for charm school to learn how to walk.  To learn how to sit, you know to learn these things.  And so she did--
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the--?
Speaker 2: Laura Dell School of Charm, Laura--at 271 West 125th Street.
Speaker 1: Was this black (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Of course.  It was [HM] Ophelia DeVore's school, of course it was black, yes.  [HM] Diahann Carroll was the receptionist part time at that time and so that's--I got to go and that was in 1954, 1954 that I went to charm school and in the spring of '54, [1954], and it was nice.  And then I graduated in August of '54 [1954] from charm school and then my first job, my first modeling job, now hear this, I had a great first modeling job.  I was a "Say Hey" kid for Willie Mays [Jr.].  He was with the New York Giants.  And Willie Mays use to say, say hey.  He didn't say hey, he said say hey.  And I was a say hey kid for Willie Mays.  That was fabulous.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well he took Harlem by storm really.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was great.  And you know the, the Polo Grounds [Upper Manhattan, New York] was right there where I lived.  I mean you could walk from the  Harlem River Houses, go through the tunnel, 8th Avenue, up 8th Avenue, cross over 8th Avenue and you're at the Polo Grounds.  So here I am growing up in Harlem [New York, New York], Polo Grounds on one side and the Yankee Stadium [Bronx, New York] on the other side.  I lived in a fabulous neighborhood.  And I mean it was busy, it was wonderful.
Story_ID: 128547
Speaker 1: Okay.  So as a "Say Hey" kid for Willie Mays, what did you do?  Did you like (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well what we did, they--there were six of us and we had little uniforms made you know, we had baseball uniforms made.  We had on sneakers and socks.  We had a baseball cap and we had to go around to stores and bars and tell everybody about Willie Mays' Day was August the 8th, 1954.  And we wanted them to come to the Polo Grounds [Upper Manhattan, New York] and we--I remember for some reason we were selling tickets or selling raffles or selling something and that's how we got paid.  As many raffles as you could sell or many tickets you could sell, you kept the money.  Ha, you know I sold a lot of tickets.  Whatever we were selling honey I was making twenty-five, and fifty dollars a night, afternoon.  So oh, about a week or so, promoting Willie Mays' Day.  That's what we were promoting Willie Mays' Day, and I made money cause they didn't have any money to pay--but they had money to give us our uniform.  We kept the uniforms.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting concept.  They didn't have to pay you a salary but they gave you a means by which you could earn the money.
Speaker 2: And I earned some money too, yeah.  It was fun and I'm still friends with one of the girls, very--Helen Williams.  No not Helen Williams--Helen Jones.  She and I are still good friends.  She lives in Florida.  Helen Ackenow [ph.], wow.  I'm friends with a lot of friends from back in the day as they say now, back in--that was really back in the day.
Story_ID: 128548
Speaker 1: So that was that, led to my-- that was my first modeling assignment, and after that I didn't really do that much [as a model], you know.  It was, there was not much of an outlet.  You do fashion shows, that's what you would do, fashion shows at churches.  And one particular fashion show they needed a commentator and the commentator I believe was going to get twenty-five dollars and the models were getting ten, so I became the commentator.  I just said, I'll be the commentator, just like that.  I'll be the commentator.  And then they heard me do the commentary.  My mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] came with me to make certain that I did the right thing and she was my critic.  Oh god was she the critic.  And she told me, well you said pretty too many times and you said this too many times and you licked your lips, you know, don't you lick your lips, you know.  You black folk always licking your lips.  Stop licking your lips and make certain you smile and take--oh, did she give me cree--feedback and criticism all the time.  That was funny.  So she was my first critic and I became a well-known commentator after that.  People would hire me.  I just started getting hired all the time.  Then I went up to thirty-five dollars an hour--I mean for the show, not an hour, for the show.
Speaker 2: That was pretty good.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was big money, big, big cause you could have a whole dress made to order for twenty-five.  So that was great.  You know whatever I made I had a new dress made.  I didn't save any money.  I was living at home and I spent my money, fun, all in Harlem [New York].  Everything was Harlem.
Speaker 2: So this is all during high school [High School of Music & Art, New York, New York], right?
Speaker 1: High school, um-hmm, all during high school.  Wow, yeah.  And then when I went on to CCNY [City College of New York, New York City] I just kept on modeling and--well it wasn't full time you know.  Not like today you know, it was the weekends.  You didn't have to take off.
Story_ID: 128549
Speaker 1: Now did you consider when you were a senior in high school thinking about college, did you consider going away to school to some other (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, I wanted to go to Howard [University, Washinton, D.C.]. I wanted to go to Howard in the worst way.  And they gave me some kind of little scholarship and my father [Raymond Bailey Smaltz] said, if you leave New York you are camping out.  Why would you leave New York?  The best schools are right here in New York City.  End of story.  End of story.  How are you going to argue with that one?  I said, but I got a scholarship.  So.  They didn't want me to leave home.  Um-um, I was not leaving home. I mean they didn't let me go away to camp.  I didn't go away to camp.  I went to, I went south and then when I got older they had friends who lived in Queens and I would stay with friends in Queens.  My mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] just, you know she had to be in total control of where I was, not with my brothers only with me.  She always knew where I was.
Speaker 1: That was the burden of being the baby girl (unclear).
Speaker 2: Probably, I don't know.  Didn't matter, I mean it was okay.  No problem with that.  So no, I didn't go away so I went right here to City College [of New York, New York City] which is like walking distance--
Story_ID: 128550
Speaker 1: Now at this time we were no longer in the Harlem River Houses.  We had moved to the Bronx [New York, New York].  We left the Bronx and we were back in Harlem [New York, New York] but what they call Washington Heights [New York, New York].  So we were on the hill.  You know there's a difference.  There's the hill and then there's the valley.  So now we're living on the hill at 158th Street between Amsterdam and Broadway at 547 West 158th Street.  And my mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] would love to say it's the second house from Broadway because see, Broadway, white folk lived on Broadway.  So she'd let you know, the second house from Broad--so funny.  And now it's all Dominican.  It's all changed.  Everything has changed in life you know.  Things that were so important, they're not even important anymore.  It's funny, funny.  Nice, very nice building, very nice apartment and my mother played her numbers and she was always--we lived right on the first floor so she could see the number men coming and going.  And, and she was just a fabulous woman.  The landlord loved her because they use to come around and collect the rent you know, cash.  It was, rent was what, $58.00, $68.00, $78.00, wasn't a lot of money.  Everybody--nothing over a hundred dollars for rent, five rooms, parquet floors, French doors you know all the trimmings.  And I guess that apartment now would probably be $1,500.00 or more dollars, maybe $2,000.00.  Oh, who knows.  Anyway, to make a long story short, the landlord came in one day and he was collecting the money from my mother and he dropped all of his money, big roll about--cash like that.  And he went around, he went--kept, kept going.  And then he called my mother or my mother called him or found him or something and she said you know you left all your money here.  You dropped your money.  You left it right here in the hallway, in our hallway.  He was shocked.  He knew he lost the money.  He didn't know he lost the money and then my mother gave him back his money.  I mean he loved my mother from then on.  Anything Mrs. Smaltz wanted, anything Mrs. Smaltz wanted Mrs. Smaltz got, anything.  It was amazing.  You know I'm the same way.  I've found a lot of stuff and I very rarely lose anything.  In fact I lose it, and then I find it, you know.  It's just how you live.  I don't know how I got on--I got off on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 128551
Speaker 1: But, so at City College of New York [New York, New York].  Now who--did you still pursue painting there or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was an art major.  But this time now I, I went to City College at--from the afternoon till the evening and so my first job I worked at, I worked at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.  That was okay.  I mean it was nice, you know, it was forty-one dollars a week or forty-four dollars a week and they gave you lunch.  And I stayed at that job for a little while.  And then since I was in art, somebody said well you need to go get a job you know as an artist.  So I--there was a thing opening for an art, commercial artist at Reuben H. Donnelley Corporation.
Speaker 1: Now this is in, this is when you grad--the year after you graduated (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, I--this is while I'm going to school cause I would work in the day and then I'd go to City College at night.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what year did you graduate from high school?  Which--what is it--?
Speaker 2: Fifty-Five [1955].
Speaker 1: Fifty-Five [1955], (unclear).
Speaker 2: Fifty-Five [1955], so this is between '56 [1956], '57 [1957], '58 [1958], '59 [1959], '60 [1960], '62 [1962].  So I stayed in college from '55 [1955], September, '55 [1955] to 1962, and I didn't graduate.  I don't know, a few--I don't even know how many credits I needed to graduate.  By this time I'm really moving along with my career in fashion and beauty, etc.  So I went to college for seven years from three in the afternoon till ten at night, at City College which was right in my neighborhood and I'd just walk home or take the bus home.  We're very--it's right--it's Harlem.  'Cause I like to tell people I was born, bred, toasted, buttered, jellied, jammed and honeyed in Harlem, and it's the truth. Everything was Harlem.
Story_ID: 128552
Speaker 1: So I got this job at Reuben H. Donnelley Corporation to do the yellow pages.  I use to do the ads in the yellow pages.  Now I was really good at doing those ads in the yellow pages cause it was the kind of job where you, you had an art director and you had, you had this easel board and you had so many specs to do.  I think you had five or ten specs a day, I don't know.  You had originals you had to fix things.  Anyway, it was a production job and I liked to talk.  Did you know that?  And so I use to talk to everybody around me and they couldn't get their work done.  Well I could talk and get my work done.  So finally the, the, the art director was so mad at me.  He put me in the corner.  I'll never forget, I had the last desk but he gave me a big window.  So I only had one person to talk to on this side.  He didn't give me somebody on that side.  So what I would do, do my work and then I'd roam the entire place.  I'd just go visit folk because I said why should I do more than anybody else?  I was fast.  I was always fast.  So anyway, I stayed with that.  That was a fun job.  I stayed with that job for a while and then the next thing because of [HM] Ophelia DeVore and modeling and you know getting to know a lot of people moving around, an opportunity came through Ophelia DeVore.  They were--Lena Horne--
Speaker 2: Can you spell that for--I'm sorry, can you spell that for us?
Speaker 1: Ophelia, O-P-H-E-L-I-A, DeVore, D-E-V-O-R-E, capital V-O-R-E, Ophelia DeVore.  And she had a model agency and the model agency is called the Grace Del Marco Model Agency.  And I use to teach charm school--excuse me--at Ophelia DeVore. I taught charm school there.  And the charm school--I started at O--I started out at Laura Dell in Harlem [New York] and then Ophelia moved to 1697 Broadway.
Speaker 2: So you taught charm school there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, for ten years.  When she gave me my ten year pin, I had to leave.  I couldn't believe I had done ten year--oh let me get out of here, ooh.  But anyway, through Ophelia people would--you did a lot of stuff through Ophelia.  You--we were in the Rheingold contest.  She would see to it that blacks got their due you know cause it was just white folk out there and they wouldn't want any--they didn't want any black folk anywhere modeling.  So she was really forceful.  But anyway, through Ophelia, that's how I got to work for Lena Horne beauty products and I started working for Lena Horne beauty products I think in 1962.
Story_ID: 128553
Speaker 1: Six--'60 [1960], '61 [1961], '60 [1960], things are really just going for me.  I had this boyfriend and then he worked for Bache & Company [later known as Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Incorporated] and Bache & Company--I have, I'm having my dates kind of mixed up.  I can go over that.  But Bache & Company, they were looking for an African American woman to train to become a stock broker.  That was me, I got that opportunity.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Bache?
Speaker 1: Bache, B-A-C-H-E, Bache & Company.  So they were looking for an African--so this young man, John Patterson told them about me cause he worked at Bache & Company in institutionals with John Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's son.  And they came into the neighborhood in Harlem [New York, New York] and they did a real, real big inspection about me, you know, you--they asked my neighbors who I was.  They wanted to know because I'm dealing with money.  So I got that opportunity to work for Bache & Company and I stayed with them for about nine months.  I went to school, all the time was going to school so I could become a registered rep.  And I took an exam, the NASAD, the National Association for Security Dis--you know Dealers.  I think it's NSAD or NASAD [NASD, National Association of Securities Dealers], whatever.  And I got that exam and then I wanted to sell you know, I wanted to be a stock broker.  Well, how are you going to be a stock broker?  I'm from Harlem.  I didn't know anybody who had any amount of money and I was going to sell mutual funds.  I think I sold my mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] and father [Raymond Bailey Smaltz], I sold a cousin or two.  I think I sold five or ten mutual funds and that was the end of my career because you can't work in that business, not unless you have money or make money.  So I wasn't making any money so I just said, oh, let me go back to modeling.
Story_ID: 128554
Speaker 1: So then I got, I was very fortunate.  I was, I, I networked a lot.  I just knew a lot of people. And there was this wonderful woman who I use to do a lot of work for.  When I say work for, I use to train her young people in how to sit, how to stand, cause I had learned that from Ophelia DeVore School of Charm and her name was Katie Hicks.  And Katie Hicks was in Harlem [New York] and she had a, some kind of organization where she was helping young people and I use to do things for her.  And she said to me one day, Audrey, you have a lot going for you but you're missing something.  You, you, you need to have psychological testing.  So she gets this wonderful man from Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey], I go through all of these psychological tests on what I'm good at.  So he finally figured out I'm really good at talking.  And I really have to be around people.  That I cannot have a job where it's production and I can't talk and I, I have to be selling something, being with people and have to be talking.  So we figured out.  You know I didn't know, but I knew I was good at math.  I was very good at math but that was boring.  Boring!  So what happened, the next thing I know I go to this, oh this whole, this orientation with this man and he gives me all these exams, nice young man from Princeton.  And then there was a job in the New York Times that said that Bloomingdale's was looking for an assistant--no, not an assistant.  Bloomingdale's was looking for a model salesperson, model salesperson.  I went and I went out for that job and they hired me.  And it was amazing why they hired me because the woman liked me a lot but she had to have these robes made especially for me cause I was so tall, but she really liked me.  So I had all these gorgeous robes that they made for me and I would wear these beautiful robes and I would sell.  I'd sell all robes that I had on and I could sell anything else in this wonderful little place called Place Elegante.  And so there I was at Bloomingdale's.
Speaker 2: What year is this?  When did you--?
Speaker 1: Nineteen Sixty-Two [1962].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's amazing cause--like between '60 [1960], '62 [1962] everything is going on.  I worked for Lena Horne, I'm working for--and just a lot is going on in my life, a lot.  And it was really very interesting because I--they liked me at Bloomingdale's and one of the HR people there said, oh you know we have a, an exam and maybe you could become an executive, a junior executive at Bloomingdale's.  And so I said okay.  So they said you got to take this exam.  This is all during Christmas selling.  So I took this exam and I did extremely well because it was the same kind of exam that, that I had just taken with Katie Hicks and the community group that she was with.  And so I did extremely well on this exam and the head woman from the executive placement committee came down to find out who is Audrey Smaltz?  So the lady with the white flower said, that's her over there and they said oh no, that can't be her.  That's Audrey.  And she looks at the, you know Smaltz, Smaltz.  And then she looks at the exam results, it was--I must have had an outstanding--and she just couldn't imagine that a black woman, a colored woman, an African American woman could have done that.  So anyway, I had to go to her office.  I get interviewed and next thing you know I'm, I'm--they want me to go through training squad and it's a long story.  But anyway, that's how I got into retailing and fashion.  I really got into fashion in another aspect, not modeling but selling, the selling of fashion, the business of fashion, working in the retail store then learning about buying and learning about being a fashion coordinator and learning about display.  I mean really it was there right at Bloomingdale's.  It was exciting.
Story_ID: 128555
Speaker 1: Okay, now before that time now did you do a lot of modeling before that time?
Speaker 2: A little bit, not a whole lot.
Speaker 1: We have pictures of--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I got plenty of pictures but--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in a beau--I was in lots of beauty contests.  Oh, I won all kind of beauty contests, Miss Medina, Miss Ponce Soeur [ph.].  I was--you--I was in another beauty contest, I can't even think of the name.  I was in Miss Schaefer [Beer], which was Miss Beaux Arts.  I didn't win.  Dee Simmons won that contest.  But I won three beauty contests and always got, you got money you know.  Oh, I was Miss Transit.  How could I forget that one?  I was Miss Transit.  Yeah, you got a Bible, $500.00 cash dollars.  Oh, and I would meet a lot of people. I was meeting people, lots of fun.  And always, everything was always wonderful.  I had a fabu--not I had.  I have a fabulous life, a wonderful life, as people would say, a blessed life, yeah, yeah, in Harlem [New York, New York].  That was all Harlem.
Story_ID: 128556
Speaker 1: So at Bloomingdale's you start off as a, as an executive now.  You're, you're--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't start off as an executive.  I started off as a model salesperson.
Speaker 1: Right, sell, selling the robes (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, selling.  Then, and then finally a year later they let me get on the training squad and I was the second black that they had on the training squad.  The very first black, the first black was Willette Klausner and she and I are still good friends.  She lives in Beverly Hills [California], Willette, a producer, she pro, she produces Three Mo' Tenors, uh-huh, Willette.  And she was the first and I was the second African American at Bloomingdale's on training squad that they allowed to be assistant buyers.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: Klausner, K-L-A-U-S-N-E-R, Willette, Willette, W-I-L-L-E-T-T-E, Willette Klausner.  Oh yeah, she's fabulous.
Speaker 1: Hmm, that's something yeah.
Speaker 2: Willette, yeah, uh-huh.  So yeah, we were at Bloomingdale's together.
Story_ID: 128557
Speaker 1: Okay.  So well how did you like it then being on the inside of the (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I liked Bloomingdale's very much.  It was very good because I had wonderful teachers.  I had Ms. Dell [ph.] who was the buyer for the robes.  She was the robe buyer and she was supposed to have three Christmas assistants and the girls couldn't cut it.  And so I was her one and only Christmas assistant.  I did the job of three girls.  She told me that later on.  She said you were fabulous.  And she said whatever you want in this store I will see to it that you get it.  And so I said well--and I had to write a big report for her.  I think I still have that report somewhere about how to improve her department.  But she said, what do you want in the store?  I said, well I want to be a fashion coordinator.  She said oh, no problem.  Doris Salinger and I are very good friends.  Doris Salinger, a family name.  J.D.'s [Jerome David Salinger] baby sister.  I met J.D.--
Speaker 1: Oh the author?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: "Catcher in the Rye."
Speaker 2: Doris--right, "Catcher in the Rye."  So I worked for Doris Salinger because Ms. Dell saw to it that I got that job and that was wonderful.  And then, so Salinger was going to hire me and then she had about three other people who wanted that job.  She said well you know other people want this job and you will be the third assistant cause she had two assistants above me.  I said fine.  So she said, well why do you want this job?  And I looked at her, I said because I have no idea what a fashion coordinator is or what a fashion coordinator does and I want to know.  She said, excellent answer.  I'm a fashion coordinator and I have no idea either.  It was so funny.  So I got the job with her and that was nice.  I went from third assistant to second assistant and that was big.  That was a big job, big.  And then I--then they noticed me on the floor you know I guess so, six feet tall and black, and then I liked that job but that was like a no-end job.  I wanted to be a buyer.  I wanted to know, find out how you buy clothes and how that worked.  So I got a job as an assistant coat and suit buyer at Lane Bryant.  I worked for a fabulous man, Bruce Morrison.
Speaker 1: Now what year is that at Lane Bryant?
Speaker 2: By this time it must be--no, no, this is at Bloomingdale's.
Speaker 1: At Bloomingdale's?
Speaker 2: Bloomingdale's.  I worked for Bruce Morrison at Bloomingdale's and this was about 1963, '64 [1964].  Oh, I guess so, 19--let me see, cause I went to the March on Washington, that was '63 [1963].  I was working for Lester Gribetz in housewares so this must have been '64 [1964], going on '65 [1965], um-hmm, working with Morrison, '64 [1964], '65 [1965], and I stayed with him until there was a job opportunity that they told me, "Audrey you must go on this job interview for Lane Bryant."  So I went on that job interview for Lane Bryant and I started working for Lane Bryant.
Speaker 1: And that's 1965?
Speaker 2: '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 128558
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to reflect--we're at 1965 when you started at Lane Bryant.  But I wanted to jump back to '64 [1964] for a second.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just to find out, I just wondered like, were you following the Freedom Summer in Mississippi in those days--
Speaker 2: Oh, of course.
Speaker 1: --with Bob [Robert Parris] Moses--
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: --and the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] people?
Speaker 2: I knew Bobby had--was there.  I didn't really know exactly what was going on.  It was very secretive you know.  So, I heard, you know through the grapevine but I really would just follow what I read in the newspapers, knowing he was there but not knowing 'cause we didn't know too much.  They didn't tell us.  It was very secretive.  But I was at--in 1963, I went to the March on Washington.  I was at Bloomingdale's and Mr. [Lester] Gribetz who was my boss at the time gave me the thirty dollars round trip ticket, can you imagine, on the plane, Eastern Air Lines shuttle.
Speaker 1: That's unusually supportive, isn't it?  Isn't it?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Isn't that unusually supportive for an employer to do that?
Speaker 2: He didn't remember.  I told him, I said, "you know you gave me the money Lester Gribetz."  "I did Audrey?"  Well everybody kind of liked me.  I could--I use--I have gotten away with a lot of things in my life and I still do.  (Laughter).  I don't know why.  People just give me--I ask.  I tell you the, I tell you the truth, I asked, I told him, I said, "I'm going to the March on Washington."  "Oh, it's going to be (makes unclear sound)."  He was upset.  I said, "I'm going.  Now I'm going.  It's Wednesday.  I'll be back Friday."  I never did get back.  (Laughter, unclear).  I called him, probably called him and they paid me and everything.  I was a good person, a good worker and this was history, the March on Washington, wow.  Then, I remember that.  So, that was '63 [1963], August 28th and then I went to Lane Bryant and then I tell that boss cause now it's '68 [1968], I said, "um, you got to let me off because I'm, I'm going to [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s funeral."  "You are?"  "Yes, and I need money.  I have absolutely no money."  So I--they gave me money so I could go to the funeral.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 128559
Speaker 1: Now did you, in '64 [1964], did you see the Democratic National Convention on television when Fannie Lou Hamer spoke and (unclear)?
Speaker 2: That was in--yeah, Fannie Hamer, yes I did.
Speaker 1: Yeah that was--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was incredible.  Now where was that convention?  '68 [1968] was Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Atlantic City [New Jersey].
Speaker 2: That was Atlantic City, yes indeed.  I remember that well with Fannie Hamer.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: She was a part of the delegation--
Speaker 2: She was a part of that delegation.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) Bob Moses brought (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, oh I remember that, 1964, wow.  Yeah, a lot was going on.  I even remember somewhere around that time, I was in Miami, Florida.  I was on the--in--but they have--called South Beach.  I was on the beach and the beach was very discriminatory, you know.  And I was at some hotel.  I think it started with an A, the Atlantis, the Atlanta, I don't know.  It started with an A and that particular hotel, we were--it was downstairs and they had a big restaurant with a huge you know place where you can eat.  What do you call that?
Speaker 1: Buffet?
Speaker 2: A counter.
Speaker 1: A buffet?
Speaker 2: No, a counter top and I sat down, another friend of ours sat down and the little lady said, "I'm not gone serve you niggers, no indeed.  I'm not gone serve you niggers."  And I was in Miami Beach.  I'm from New York City, you know it's, whoa.  And I said, "well I'm not moving until you serve me."  And I said can you imagine here's this woman making fifteen dollars a week telling me that she's not going to serve me and we stayed there till the police came.  The police came and they took us to jail.  Nothing happened.  My--that was my time in jail.  But I would not leave.  The police made us leave.  But they called the police and what you gonna do?  The lady, that lady, I think they fired her.  She refused to serve us.  Isn't that sad?  So that was my only claim to fame.
Speaker 1: That's something.  Now I'll tell you like in the rest of the country, I mean you would--living in Ohio, we would never have suspected that you couldn't be served in Miami Beach.
Speaker 2: It was on Miami Beach.
Speaker 1: Black people didn't even think about that.  I think some probably knew but you know--
Speaker 2: Well you know--
Speaker 1: --growing up, you didn't know that.
Speaker 2: --blacks couldn't be on the beach except during the day.  At night you better be, honey, cause if you didn't work for somebody on the beach, if you didn't have a job on the beach, you better not be on the beach.  It was very discriminatory there cause, oh, I use to stay in what they called Overtown [neighborhood in Miami], you know at the Sir John Hotel in Miami.  That was called Overtown, where the black folk live.  Nothing wrong with that area but it wasn't Miami Beach you know, wasn't the water and the ocean and all those beautiful hotels, yeah that's--it wasn't like that.  But that was all right.  So that was just--that's about what I can remember, you know and reading about--you know reading Jet [magazine].  You would get all your information from Jet magazine.

Speaker 1: What was going on--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now did, did you--when did you first pick up on the Ebony Fashion Fair?  Were you always kind of aware of that when it was--?
Speaker 1: Always aware of the Ebony Fashion Fair because the very first Ebony Fashion Fair, my friends were in it.  Elaine Calloway and Carol Brantley, they were in the very first Ebony Fashion Fair.  And I knew Freda DeNight and I had modeled for Ebony magazine, you know because of my Ebony days.  So I knew in 1958, the very first Ebony Fashion Fair had only went to a couple of cities 'cause my two girlfriends who grew up with me in Harlem [New York, New York], they were in it.  So I always knew about it.
Story_ID: 128561
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Lane Bryant, now tell us about what you did at Lane Bryant from '60 [1960]--
Speaker 2: At Lane Bryant when I was hired there by George Paley [ph.], who was the president of Lane Bryant Tall, so I worked for Lane Bryant Talls as the tall model and the buyer.  I was a tall model and a buyer and that was really exciting because he told me that I couldn't wear designer clothes anymore, I had to wear Lane Bryant clothes.  Ugh, I was really upset with that, Lane Bryant--
Speaker 1: Now Lane--
Speaker 2: --cause the clothes are very inexpensive, cause I only wore--I was at Bloomingdale's wearing designer clothes.  I had designer this and designer that and then I couldn't wear it.  But then I got used to it because I got all my clothes for free and then I was very enterprising.  I had so many clothes and I could sell clothes to all of my friends from my apartment.  So I had a side, you know gig going on.  I had two racks in my living room.  I used to sell clothes, 'cause I had--everything was made on my body.  So then I was the--a model and then they told me that I had to remain a model and I said no, no, no, I want to be a buyer and then I became an assistant buyer.  And then he said well Audrey in order for you to you know just be a buyer or assistant buyer fulltime, you have to find a model.  You know I went to the stores and I found another model take my place.  They still liked me though. I said listen don't do that.  This girl is very nice--I (laughter), cause I didn't want to model anymore.  And then from there they asked--they made me the fashion coordinator and then I just, just took that business and just--oh, it was wonderful.  They just let me have my, my way.  And then I stayed there until it was time for me to get married.
Story_ID: 128562
Speaker 1: And so it was 1969, and I told my boss at Lane Bryant that I was getting married and he didn't mind that but what he was so upset about, that I was moving to Chicago [Illinois].  And I was marrying Dr. Stanley Hughes.  So I married Dr. Stanley Hughes, moved to Chicago in May of 1969, thirty-six years ago.
Speaker 2: Now where did you meet Dr. Stanley Hughes?
Speaker 1: Well you won't believe this but I met him through a very friend named Dorothea Towles Church and she was one of the top models.  In fact she was the first model who modeled in Paris [France].  And Dorothea and I both taught at Ophelia DeVore School of Charm, that's where we met.  And she had two friends coming into town, Marshall Bynum out of Chicago and Stanley Hughes.  And she knew Marshall very well and they were here for the World Series in September of 1960-whatever.  I have to look that up.  Anyway nineteen early sixties, and that's how I met Stanley in New York City.  And when he was here--I think Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], right.  I remember Pittsburgh was playing the Yankees and they would, they had a Cadillac, they'd drive from--they stayed at the Summit Hotel.  It's called--it's not the Summit anymore, and they would drive to Pittsburg, doing you know three, four days here in you know, New York and then they'd drive to Pittsburg (laughter), it was hysterical, and then drive back.  That's what those guys use to do in those days, um-hmm.  So that's how I met Stanley.  But then that was very early '60s [1960s].  I'd say I met Stanley in '61 [1961], maybe '60 [1960].  I think I, I met him in '60 [1960], '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Yeah that World Series with Pittsburgh and the Yankees was '60 [1960], I think when Bill Mazeroski [William Stanley "Bill" Mazeroski] hit the home run.
Speaker 1: There you go!  So it was 1960, I met him.  Okay, and we didn't get married till 1969.  I know, I knew him a long time before we got married.  And then I moved to Chicago.  That's how I got to have all my Chicago friends.  And I met the Johnsons [John H. and Eunice Johnson] because our marriage didn't last very long and it was the--we were getting a divorce and within a year we were getting a divorce.
Speaker 2: Now that's what, you know, you went together for a long time and knew each other a long--
Speaker 1: Hey when you, when you live with somebody, it's another story honey.  Long distance romances are fabulous you know.  You see each other and excited you know.  When you live with each other day-by-day, things change.  Well anyway it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't right but what happened he had this daughter and the best thing that happened to me was to have a beautiful daughter now you see?  So everything turned out great.
Story_ID: 128563
Speaker 1: So that didn't last long so I knew this marriage wasn't working out and I went to the judge 'cause you know by this time we had gone to court and so the judge had--was giving me a lot of money and I, oh I could live on this money you know.  And I had my own apartment at the Windermere Hotel yeah.  You know the Windermere right on the lake?  At the Windermere Hotel--
Speaker 2: It's very nice (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I was living at 6700, why not?  I was living on the lake so I couldn't live less than the lake.  Anyway the judge says to me, Ms. Smaltz, well what do you do?  Now you know you can find a job.  I was too through.  He told me I had to find a job and I found a job.  So I called my girlfriend Delores, LaDoris Foster, who worked for [HM] John [H.] Johnson and I said LaDoris, I would like to do the Ebony Fashion Fair.  Now I know they have a commentator.  I know they have somebody but what I need is a little part-time job.  When this girl is sick, if she can't speak, I can just do the commentary cause I could do commentary.  That's all I did in New York [City].  I was the commentator so I knew how to do a commentary.  So I said set up an appointment with Eunice Johnson and she did.  And she set up an appointment, I went to see the Johnsons and they had models there that day and Mr. Johnson was in the library and the models were there and then he said Audrey, okay let me hear you do the commentary.  And I just started talking with whatever the models had on, I just started talking.  He said, whoa, that was unbelievable, cause he--you know, I just described things in a very unusual way.  And he said wow, come back into our office.  So I went into the office and he said, well tell me about yourself.  I said well, I'm married to Dr. Stanley Hughes but I'm getting a divorce.  You're married to Stanley Hughes.  Oh you're not going to divorce him.  Yes I am.  I've been to court and I have to have a job.  (Laughter).  I was just matter of fact.  I said listen--but why would you leave?  I said I'm leaving the doctor.  Oh but he's a pillar in the community.  Fine, I'm not there.  So anyway both of them hire--you know interviewed me and then he said too--it was really funny, he said, well--I said if you need a reference let, call this number here.  And I had him dial George Paley's number of Lane Bryant cause I just left a year ago.  And he got George Paley right on the phone.  George Paley got on the phone and he said to John Johnson, well listen if you don't hire her we want her back here at Lane Bryant.  We miss her so much and she's fabulous and dah, dah, dah.  Mr. Johnson said, hired!  Hired!  So I was hired right away, I mean one ref--one phone call.  And I started working there in August of 1970.  I started the 13th of August, 1970.  And I had a little routine of being you know, the housewife and so forth.  And so I'd start a job and I can't believe it, I'm going to work every morning.  And then when it got to be Friday, I said oh my God, thank God it's Friday.  I can get my nails done.  I can get my hair done.  I can get things done because I couldn't get anything done.  I had a job working nine to five.  This was unusual.  To make a long story short, I'd go into Mr. Johnson's office, he calls me in his office, he says Audrey you need to go to Detroit [Michigan] this weekend because I need some models and there are some Detroit models that I want you to look at.  I said but I have to get my nails done.  I have to get my hair done.  He said not this weekend.  So I go to Detroit and he's in his office and there's books stacked everywhere.  I said, oh my god, look at this book.  I want that.  I, I have to have a, that book.  I have to have that book.  And if you're going to send me to Detroit, I have to have something to read on the plane.  And the book is, 'I Know Why A Caged Bird Sings' [sic, 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'] by [HM] Maya Angelou.  He had stacks of them, gave me my book.  I said okay.  He said go to see Mrs. So-and-So, get your money and that was, that was it.  I've been traveling for Ebony from then on.  I mean the very first week I had to get on a plane for them.  And I started, I did the Ebony Fashion Fair.  It was the most incredible experience one could have, traveled first class all over the world, first class.  They had first class hotels, meet the greatest people in the world--
Speaker 2: Now the--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--on both sides of the Atlantic [Ocean].
Story_ID: 128564
Speaker 1: Now the Ebony Fashion Fair was the idea of Eunice Johnson, right?  I mean what started the--
Speaker 2: Actually it was the idea of Freda DeNight.  It was Freda DeNight's--well you know it's a lot of stories mixed up now after forty eight years.  But Mrs. Dent from New Orleans, Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana], she needed a fundraiser and she called--she, she said she called Freda [DeNight], Freda spoke to [HM] John [H.] Johnson, John Johnson said fine and Freda got a fashion show together cause Freda was the Fashion Editor or the Home Director Editor or something.  And Daviera Edwards [ph.] knew about fashion shows who was Freda's assistant, and so they got a fashion show together.  They picked up the girls out of New York.  Those are all basically New York girls I think, cause two of my friends are--I'm sure there were some other girls in there and they hit the road with six shows in 1958.  And they went by plane and then they realized it's--then it was thirty shows and then they needed a bus and then from then on it's now 160 shows.  So when I went there we were doing about seventy-eight shows and then into the third year with me, we doubled those shows.  So we went from January to December, we had a break and then we went, we were--excuse me, we went from September through December, then we had a break and we went from January through April.  And I think basically they still do that same schedule, I'm not sure, but it was an incredible time.  I met Yves St. Laurent, I met Givenchy, Hubert de Givenchy, Emanuel Ungaro, Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta, Pauline Trigere.  I met all the top designers of the world.  I went to their ateliers.  We purchased clothes.  Eunice had an unlimited budget to buy anything she wanted.  We purchased all the clothes for the Ebony Fashion Fair.  We'd come back, I would organize the show.  I was the fashion coordinator.  We hired the models, we'd have model exhibits where the--auditions where the models would come from all over cause there are thousands of girls and guys who wanted to be an Ebony Fashion Fair model.  And I--all those young ladies, not all, but so many of them are still my friends.  And the most beautiful people you can imagine I met on the road with the Ebony Fashion Fair, doctors, lawyers, Indian Chiefs, bus drivers, sanitation workers, you name it.  And people even till this day, "Audrey, I remember you from the Ebony Fashion Fair."  I say, "oh, you must be very old.  That was thirty years ago."  But so many people always remember me from the Ebony Fashion Fair.  I had fun.  I was a fun commentator.  I would just sit up there in a high chair and just talk.
Speaker 1: Can you give--
Speaker 2: Make people laugh.
Story_ID: 128565
Speaker 1: Can you give us some example of what you might say?
Speaker 2: I used to say crazy things.  A girl would come out and she'd have on a white fox collar on a white wool jacket and a long skirt and a little belt there, all in white fox and she'd stand there, and I said uh, consider this to wear when the invitation says don't dress, you know.  I mean she was just so drop dead in white wool and white fox, you know.  And then I would say, another suit, I loved this suit.  It was gray and she was the symphony of gray.  Gray hat, gray shoes, everything was gray, more fox and I'd say to the ladies as the girl was walking down the runway, Ladies what to wear on Sunday when you don't get home till Monday.  They'd scream cause everybody could relate to that.  And then you would see a Jersey dress, a matte Jersey on this perfect body, perfect body and she's walking the runway and I'd say, Mother may have, then papa may have and god blesses--and everybody else knew the rest, you looked at that you said well I'll be darned, look at that.  And then we'd have a client like Sears who would advertise with us and because we had bought the clothes from all over the United States, I'd say what to--uh, I would say, and if you can't get to Paris and if you can't get to Rome, try Sears.  The people screamed because the outfit looked great, you know that it was Sears.  Oh my god, Sears!  And then I would say, and what do you suppose she's wearing underneath this gown?  Hanes pantyhose.  They--another advertiser, they would laugh.  And a beautiful fur and I'd say, ladies you owe it to yourselves, you know, get a second job, whatever.  They would just-- every night we'd just go on and there was a commercial once that said don't mess with Mother Nature.  And I would, you know use whatever was current whatever was popular at the time.  Whatever was going on around me, that's what I used for my commentary and I never insulted anybody.  I never told you what color it was.  You could see the color and I never said, "and she's wearing".  Well you know she's wearing it.  She's got it on.  You just talk about it.  I would teach them, it was on the bias.  It could be Emilio Pucci print and you know it's Pucci print but only those who wear Pucci know that he signs Emilio, see.  I would say Valentino, Rome and his last name is Garavani.  Nobody knew his last name was Garavani.  It was just--till this day it's Valentino.  And I would say Hubert de Givenchy and everybody thought it was Givenchy [pronouncing it guh-vin-chee], so it was fun.  And I'd sit up there, cross my legs, have my high heels, and just, just talk and mess with guys in the audience and talk to people in the audience and just have fun.  Just have fun, laugh, just laugh and just have fun with the fashion, you know not serious.  So I knew fashion, I spoke well and I, I, I had a sense of humor and that worked.  It worked very, very well.
Story_ID: 128566
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were with Ebony [magazine] until or Johnson [Publishing Company] until 19--?
Speaker 2: For seven years.  That's the longest time I ever had a job, seven years.  Usually my jobs were three and half years, the most.  This one was seven.
Speaker 1: So, well what happened in '77 [1977]?  Why did you decide to stop?
Speaker 2: I turned forty.  Oh, my god, oh, oh, am I going to be on this Greyhound bus going from city to city at forty?  No way Jose.  And a great awakening, it's Sunday morning, I'm leaving Memphis, Tennessee on my way to Little Rock, Arkansas or vice versa, I don't know.  I was leaving one, one of those little southern towns going into another and I says, "Smaltz, how many years are you going to sit on this bus?"  I had the eighth seat on the right hand side of the bus if you're going straight ahead.  That was my seat.  I said, "no-no, no-no, no-no."  And so then I started making plans.  What am I going to do?  So that was like February of '77 [1977], and I waited till August.  I told [HM] John [H.] Johnson in July that I was leaving and I was on my way to Europe with Eunice and he said Audrey, if you want to have a pleasant trip in Europe do not mention to my wife that you are leaving.  And he was very happy that I was going into business for myself and he said, well I'll be your first client and I will tell my wife that you are leaving but that's after you come back from Europe.  And then he said you have been such a fabulous person, a wonderful worker.  I have had no problems with you, nothing.  And he said why you don't take two weeks in Europe on me?  Whoa!  All expenses paid on John Johnson, and I did.  I worked, I did my European trip which was July, and I stayed on in Europe for about two weeks and I had the best time.  And I came back and I called Eunice Johnson and I told her, "I said Mrs. Johnson, I am letting you know that I am resigning as of the 13th of August and a letter is in the mail to you," cause everything was mailed in those days.  She was furious.  She was so mad.  She was really mad.  I thought John Johnson was going to tell her but he didn't.  So anyway then I left and I started my business.
Story_ID: 128567
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you come back here to New York [City]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came back to New--but I was always in New York when I worked for [HM] John [H.] Johnson.  I, I wasn't in Chicago [Illinois].  I sold space when I wasn't doing the Ebony Fashion Fair, I was a salesperson.  Oh, I had to earn my keep.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were hired in Chicago but you actually moved back to Harlem?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--my office was in New York City.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we worked at 1290--1270 Avenue of the Americas.  So I worked in the New York City office of Ebony Magazine.  I'd go to Chicago all the time.  I mean I could be in Chicago five, six, seven times a year.  Then I was on the road all over the United States traveling or I was in Europe, wherever I was.  But my office was at 1270 Avenue of the Americas.  From the very first time, from the very first show was '70 [1970], and I started work in the New York office in January of '71 [1971].  And that's when I was told that I would be a salesperson.  So I sold space.  I learned a lot.  I learned a lot working for Johnson Publishing, a lot, great job, fabulous job.  Best job a young girl could possibly have.
Story_ID: 128568
Speaker 1: When you started your own business now what did you focus on with your business?
Speaker 2: With my own business, I wanted to have what was called an atelier.  I wanted to sell clothes at a very reasonable price from Europe, yeah 'cause it--I use to, I use to be on the international best dressed list and I had all these great clothes and I got them in Europe because I found out all the little places to shop where people didn't know about it.  And I wanted to bring all of those clothes into New York [City] and sell them to my friends.  Well I was way ahead of time because my friends couldn't afford what I-- the prices I was selling at.  It wasn't a bargain for them.  What I spent on clothes was far more than what any one of my friends spent on clothes, so that didn't work out.  That was a bust.  And I had another friend who was doing something similar in Memphis, Tennessee and I gave her my clothes on consignment and whatever she sold, she sold.  She gave me some money.  I lost a lot, a bundle.  But I knew when you make a mistake, get out, get out, get out fast.  That was not working.  The atelier where I was creative and I'm selling clothes, that was a disaster.  You hear me?  A mistake.  I got out boom, boom, boom.  Next thing I know, that was that year, that same year Alma Rangel calls me, Audrey!  Audrey, we need you to do the Black Caucus Fashion Show!  No problem.  I had three weeks to organize the Black Caucus Fashion Show and that was a biggie.  That was a biggie.  Nineteen seventy-eight, I did the Black Caucus Fashion Show.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then within that time I, I was with very good friends.  I had just started my business so that wasn't working.  But I met with a man name Chip Rubenstein and Chip Rubenstein was the husband of Anne Klein, the famous designer.  And he said to me, Audrey what are you doing?  I said well I'm doing a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  I wasn't really doing that much.  I was--and I didn't try to pretend I was somebody really fabulous which I used to do you know.  I didn't have a dime but oh, (unclear sounds).  Anyway I said let me cut the BS, tell him the truth.  I don't know where I'm going.  I started my business, it's not easy.  So he said great.  I have a friend at Revlon and that they need to talk to you because Revlon wants to start a line of black cosmetics.  You'd be the perfect person for us.  I talked to Revlon and sure enough, I get this fabulous job with Revlon and they send me to Fort Worth, Texas at Foley's [now Macy's] to do fashion shows and whatever for them.  [HM] John [H.] Johnson finds out about this.  He calls me on the phone, "Audrey how could you work for the white man?  How could you do this to me?"  I said excuse me, "I'm working for the green dollar.  It has nothing to do with white, black, yellow."  "Well how could you work for Revlon?  And you know Fashion Fair"--and I said, "hey Mr. Johnson"-"well I'm coming to New York [New York] and I understand you're leaving for Europe."  I said, "how do you know what I'm doing?"  "I know everything you're doing."  He was keeping track of what I was doing.  So to make a long story short, he came to New York and signed a contract so that I could work for Fashion Fair cosmetics.
Story_ID: 128569
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were a Fashion Fair consultant in '78 [1978], '79 [1979] for Johnson [Publishing]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I got that--it was really great because I think what happened, I remember with Revlon I was making $500.00 a day and expenses.  So [HM] Mr. [John H.] Johnson comes to New York to my office/apartment at 15 W. 55th Street and in handwritten, I still have it, handwritten contract, and he said, Audrey how much do you want?  I said $2,500.00 a day.  (Laughter).  I trip, I mean, five times the amount I was getting with Revlon.  And he gave it to me cause he really, he didn't want me working for the white man.  Wasn't that funny?  And I kept that job with him.  I was his consultant for at least three to four years.  We did very well.  It's all about selling and I was selling some cosmetics.  That's all.  The end result in anything is you know, could be great but if it's not selling, how good can it be?  So I did work with him for that length of time in, in the cosmetic firm.  And it, it--with--for Fashion Fair and as I, you know--and that's it, was fun.  And then I started The Ground Crew--actually the very first Ground Crew started in 1978 when I did the Black Caucus 'cause I said--I did the caucus in '78 [1978] and '79 [1979].  And who were the first Ground Crewers, the Howard girls.  My stepdaughter [Nancy Hughes-Williams] was at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  I told her to get her girlfriends together from the dormitory as many as she could and I'm coming down there with a bus full of clothes and hair and make-up people and a director and I'm the commentator and I need people to run that back stage.  And so the first Ground Crew started with the girls from Howard.  They brought ironing boards, irons, they, they took care of all the clothes, they set up the racks.  I told them what to do and that was the first Ground Crew, the Howard girls.
Speaker 1: So but this concept is unique to you, you know.  People, I mean all these years in the fashion industry, no one, no, no one had ever organized a ground crew really just to do a fashion show right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Until you did it.
Speaker 2: See, they always wanted a producer.  So they wanted somebody with a name and then that producer would just get as many freelance people, any old body whether they knew anything or not.  But I trained all of the people that worked for me.  Now I can say that, but in the beginning I would tell people well you know they're trained and they're professional.  I just had to make them professional in a hurry, in a hurry.  But now you have to go through a real training school 'cause there's a lot to be done backstage at a fashion show and you cannot stand around there like this, so, well what should I do next?
Speaker 1: Now you described, I think it was off camera before we even started rolling the chaos that can ensue back stage with a fashion show.  You got hundreds of people in a small space--
Speaker 2: Chaos, right.
Speaker 1: --buzzing around trying to do things and a lot of clothes and articles flying here (unclear).
Speaker 2: Everywhere.  And not only that, see, that's what you have now.  You have say sixty models and then you have sixty Ground Crewers who are dressing and pressing and tailoring.  And then you, you, you have your hair and make-up people could have twenty or thirty hair and make-up people and you have stylists and assistant stylists and you have--but in addition to that now you have just as many photographers and videographers and celebrities.  Backstage is a mess, but not to me and not to us.  We know how to keep it calm and cool.  In the eye of that storm, we don't lose our head.  We keep our heads about us--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --cause it's just, you know it's just a fashion show.  Of course people don't think of it like that.  Just a fashion show to me, but I've done so many.  I guess I've done, I don't know ten thousand fashion shows in my lifetime, at least five [thousand].
Story_ID: 128570
Speaker 1: So in addition to the technical support you render, you also kind of serve as a, it's like a stage management team too, behind the scenes?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, you have to have a stage--we did for the recent show we did recently for BET [Black Entertainment Television].  They were having their very first hip hop fashion show.  They didn't know anything about fashion.  I had to have on stage left and stage right, I had to have girls on headsets and they didn't even have headsets for us.  We had to--we just knew how to send them out on time.  And three people to line them up.  And then we would make certain they were getting dressed.  We had a lot to do and we were only fifteen.  They'll know the next time they're going to give me what I really need.  They didn't have the budget they said, they thought.  But we know how to stage manage a show, send them out.  We know how to call the show, we know about the music for the show, you name it.  Whatever it takes to put on a fashion show, The Ground Crew can do it.  But where I found my niche in this business was behind the scenes and not trying to be that producer, taking care of the models, the dressing and the pressing and the setting up a backstage and guaranteeing the designer or the manufacturer or this department store that nothing would be missing, nothing, not one (touches earring) nothing.  Do you know how much money I saved you?  Because if you hired somebody that was free and I mean that, hired because they would say, Audrey I could can get that for free.  Oh, that's free.  Oh Audrey you charge too much money, I don't need you.  And they still say that till this day.  When I say to you, but I guarantee you won't be losing an earring that cost you thousands of dollars.  I'm going to save money.  And soon as the people who realized how much money they were saving 'cause nothing was being stolen, oh that's why we have a very substantial business.  We're working all the time.  We just don't work during fashion show week--
Speaker 1: So security is a big issue, I guess with all those people, right?
Speaker 2: A huge is security--
Speaker 1: These are expensive clothes, expensive jewelry, right?
Speaker 2: And you got to watch the, the models will take it in a minute.  Ooh they're the best thieves, the models 'cause once they wear it, oh.  Oh the designer said I could have those shoes Audrey.  Oh please, she did not say you could not have or he did not say you could have those shoes.  You got to watch scarves, earrings, bracelets.  And many times we'd have the, real jewelry.  When I mean real, precious jewelry, not costume, diamonds, diamond necklaces, diamond bracelets.  Oh, girls will walk off with a diamond bracelet in a minute.  They forget the, the jeweler forgets to put it--take it off the--when that girl comes off the runway you are supposed to be there and grab that jewelry and bring it back to the table and you put it on another girl and she goes out and you have somebody over here.  It's a system.  It's a system and I've come up with a system that works and it works that way.  The shows have to be "girled", the shows have to be--the clothes have to be in order.  They have to be numbered, you have to have a board, you have to see the model's name, her shoe size.  You have to try on the shoes before she walks on that runway.  Most of the time that's your problem shoes, always shoes.  And it's fun and it takes only a few minutes and you have one chance to get it right, one chance.  This is not a Broadway play.  This is not theatre.  It's not going to Connecticut and coming into Broadway.  We start out on 7th or 6th Avenue.  We start out on Broadway and you can't have a rehearsal.  Those models get one thousand an hour, fifteen thousand for a show.  How can you afford a rehearsal?  You can't, it's too expensive.  It's prohibitive.  So we have to have it timed just right, know what you have to do.  Everything should be in order and if it's not in order we can come in there and make it in order cause a lot of people say--think it's easy to put on a fashion show.  And they say well I know how to put on a fashion show.  We get in there and nothing is done, nothing.  They've had clothes on one rack, oh the models are going to put on this outfit and then they're going to come back and take this outfit off. Oh no, no, that's not going to work.  So we just have a system, The Ground Crew system, and it works.  And we have lots of wonderful clients, wonderful clients.  And if they're not wonderful, we don't work for you.  We don't work for you.  We have turned down a few jobs in our lifetime.  You know the people who are not nice.  You're not nice, hey it's okay.  You hire somebody else.  But we don't need to work for you.

Speaker 1: Do you run across very much color prejudice these days?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah, very few black models on the runway.  Oh, one, two, very few black models.  As far as I'm concerned, I'm sure there were many times I didn't get a job because I am who I am, I'm sure.  But I, I just kept going cause I got my share.  I have more--not more than I can use or more than I can do.  I can always do more but it's okay.  I have a lot in top names, you know.  I work for the top names.  And I work for people who would never hire me.  One guy just hired The Ground Crew and I had been marketing him for more than fifteen years because he got so tired of the other group he was working with I guess and they, they kind of messed up.  You know they, they messed up one too many times.  We don't have an opportunity to mess up cause once you mess up, that's it.  You never get that job again.  So don't mess up.  And I've messed up a few times but people call me back because then they realize it really wasn't such a big mix up.  Our backstage--and you compare it to other back stages, is calm, cool and collected.  If it's not The Ground Crew cause it can be disaster backstage, disaster.  Models are smoking, models have to go to the bathroom, models are drinking, some having champagne, ugh!  In the old days, when I say the old days in the '80s [1980s], those girls were coking it out, (snorts) woo, Audrey I got to go to the bathroom.  And I knew why they had to go to the bathroom, take their last snort, beautiful girls.  Thank God you don't see too many drugs now.  You know if the drugs is not there, that's good but in the '80s [1980s], whoa, was it rampant.
Speaker 1: So it's actually changed since--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and the girls are young.  They can't even walk in high heels.  They're 13, 14, 15, they're very young.  Of course you still have some good girls out there, like a Naomi Campbell whose almost thirty-five, if not thirty-five, walking it.  She charges thirty thousand dollars to walk a show.  Well, she's a supermodel.
Story_ID: 128572
Speaker 1: Who--do you have any favorites of the models that are out here now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were a lot of favorite models for me, a lot.  But I don't want to really mention any of them.  There were a lot of them who were always nice to us.  And I'm always nice to everybody.  They always remember me.  In fact one of my, one of my favorite models, I just saw her this weekend in a movie.  She was in Hitch, Amber Valletta--Amber Valletta and I did a show for her in her hometown Tulsa, Oklahoma for one of her big benefits, many, many years ago, and I knew this girl was special.  You know you can tell when a model is going to be more than a model and now she's an actress and she's doing all kind of wonderful things and it's great you know, really is.  A lot of the--you can, you can tell some of those top girls and it's nice to see them when they come back, backstage, Audrey!  Of course, I don't do all the shows.  I only do a few shows.  We might have thirty shows within a week or two and I'll do three or four, that's it, cause The Ground Crew can take over without me, which is great.
Story_ID: 128573
Speaker 1: So what are your future plans for The Ground Crew?  Do you have--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I would hope that some of the Ground Crewers can buy it, keep me on as a consultant.  They can take it over and make it fly bigger than what it is now, make it really big, whatever.  I'm hoping in the next two and a half years, I will be out of the business other than just consulting if they need me to consult with them.  But I hope to sell it to whoever--
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause it--
Speaker 2: --within the crew.
Speaker 1: --seems like it's a valuable trademark.
Speaker 2: It really is.  It's a wonderful service and we're trying to brand it.  It's fun.  And, and everybody who works with me, they seem to like it.  You know, even they get mad at me cause I'm a pain in the ass.  Oh, I really am a pain and I know it.  You know I can be, uh, you know, I'm not great.
Speaker 1: Well if you're going to manage something that size you got to--
Speaker 2: Hey, but they come back and they always say Audrey, you know what you taught me?  You know what you did for me?  You did this, you did that.  And I have clients calling me all over on my cell phone.  Yesterday I had a client call me from, I don't know where she was.  She said this is Paola, Audrey.  I'm a bridal designer and please call my company, dah, dah-dah, dah-dah.  They call, I mean I have come--I have clients from Spain, from, you name it, all over it's great.
Speaker 1: So you take the crew all over the world?
Speaker 2: We can but they, they come to New York [City].  That's the fashion capital.  You could say Paris [France] is the fashion capital but I used to do shows in Paris for Patrick Kelly and--but New York is the fashion capital.  People from Brazil come here, Dominican Republic, you name it, Paris, Rome [Italy], they all come here to show and they usually work with The Ground Crew.  We worked for Giorgio Armani.  I mean you don't get bigger than Giorgio Armani, now do you?  He's the biggest of all the designers out there.  He has made the most money.  He has the best business and it's his business, it's not a LVMH [Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE].  It's not owned by a big corporation.  It's owned by Giorgio Armani.  He's seventy years old.  We just did a show for him.  We've been working with him now and then he, he calls on The Ground Crew.  We work for him twice a month, every month in his New York showroom.  You know once we start, we establish a relationship we hope to grow that relationship and keep it going.  And that's what I hope, you know The Ground Crew can just keep, keep a relationship.  That's what life is a relationship, and keep it growing and having fun and making money at the same time.  Can you imagine, what else do you want?  Friendship, fun, money, relationship, health and we've got it all in The Ground Crew.  We're blessed.

Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Ooh, that they get an education.  I cannot tell you how important that every child being born now, every child that was born five years ago, that they finish high school.  That they may not have to go to college but they have to go to some vocational school.  They have to take up something that specializes in something.  They must be able to read, to write, to talk, to be able to get along and you cannot get along hanging out on the corner.  Hanging out, I'm so sick of seeing people hanging out.  I want them to get educated, that is the number one factor.  We must go all the way and beyond the way.  And if we can go on to college and go on to grad school and continue to get an education for as long as you live.  I got an education just recently, just by working on a television show.  Did I learn a lot?
Speaker 1: Is this the BET show?
Speaker 2: Yes, I learned so much what they had to go through.  So that you can constantly improve yourself and the next thing after this important education, I can't tell you how important, that's the most important--and that you associate yourself with people who know more than you, who are brighter than you, who can bring something to your life, that you can bring something to their life, that you can learn from these people.  Do not hang out with people who are less than you.  Well I shouldn't say it like that but I mean it 'cause there are too many people are hanging out with just dry--you know just trifling, I call them.  My mother used to say trifling folk, ain't doing nothing, helping their cousin.  Well what is the cousin doing? Nothing.  Stay with people who are doing something, accomplishing something.  You have something to, to grab hold of.  Oh, I want to do that.  I knew I wanted to go into business for myself.  [HM] John [H.] Johnson was in business for himself, hmm, I'm going into business for myself.  But I couldn't go into business for myself until I had that experience.  I had the experience of corporate America, of publishing, of retailing, you name it, I got it and I just listened and I learned.  I don't always talk so much.  I do listen.
Story_ID: 128575
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back on all the things that you've been able to accomplish over these many years, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Wow, I don't think differently.  The only thing I sometimes tell people that I regret is that I have this fabulous apartment on 55th Street and it never went co-op.  I still pay rent.  I'm mad about that.  It should have gone co-op.  I was ready to buy.  Well of course if it ever becomes a co-op I would buy it no matter what age I am.  I like people to--you have to own property.  Differently?  I probably--no, I wouldn't have saved more.  I saved my money.  I, I took risks.  What would I have done differently?  Maybe I wouldn't have been so loud.  You know I'm loud.  I am really loud.  I wish that I wasn't.  My mother [Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] tried that I was a little softer, just a little bit soft.  I can get so loud.  I scare people.  I guess that's what I wish, that I wasn't so loud.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Well (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm so loud.
Story_ID: 128576
Speaker 1: On the other side of the spectrum when you look back at everything you've done so far what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: A legacy.  You know that is great question because I'm seeing it unfold.  The young people that I have trained in these twenty-seven years, they're doing such great things.  There are lawyers out there, there are doctors, there are designers out there.  There are all these wonderful people, make-up artists, they're all doing so terrific and they come and then they say, Audrey if it wasn't for you.  A judge came to me the other day, called me on the phone.  I never--it's--this is Judge [Joyce] Aluoch.  Yes.  Oh, from Nairobi, Kenya?  Oh, Connie's [Connie Aluoch] mother!  Audrey, if it wasn't for you my daughter wouldn't be where she is today.  This is a Judge from Nairobi, Kenya telling me it was because her daughter was with me for eight or nine months, that I gave her the focus that her daughter is now in Kenya doing this and doing that, working for Kenyan Cosmo and I'm going--I started crying.  And all of this is happening.  The legacy for me is that I have put something out there that was within me to you, to you and you and you are taking it and you're flying with it.  You're soaring, you're doing something that's important and I'm just so happy about that.  And the kids come and tell me, Audrey you did this for me and you did that.  And I don't--Audrey, you remember what you said to me, hecky no sweetheart.  Tell me what did I say to you darling?  I don't remember but I gave them inspiration, I motivated them.  I gave them something that they could hold on to.  I told them that they could do it when they didn't think they could do it.  You know people doubt themselves.  You know people are not sure of themselves.  They're scared.  They don't want to take a risk.  You got to try it.  Come on go for it, what the heck.  It's not open heart surgery, it's just a fashion show, you know.  They make it so important and it's just, do it.  And if you fail so what, get up and start again.  If you fail, get up and hit it again.  I love it.
Story_ID: 128577
Speaker 1: Okay, now I know your parents [Raymond Smaltz and Rebecca Dora Capers-Smaltz] have passed but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, thirty-one years ago.
Speaker 1: Did they--
Speaker 2: Mother, today.
Speaker 1: Did they get a chance to see you in the fashion industry?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes indeed.  Oh, my mother was so proud.  Yes indeed.  She loved when I worked for Eunice Johnson.  She would go with me to the airport.  You know I'm going first class, TWA [Trans World Airlines].  She loved when I worked for Lane Bryant, for Mr. Paley.  She would be at my apartment when he'd pick me up with the limousine.  Oh, she was right in on everything.  She'd come to every Ebony Fashion Fair.  Oh, yes and she would--oh, she was the best dressed hand me up person, not a hand me down, hand me up because I only wore designer clothes and she said Audrey now you've had that coat for about a year and half now.  It's time for me.  She was tall you know.  I mean she would wear a different coat every single day because, Audrey, those shoes, how long have you had those shoes?  I could use--we wore the same clothes, so she--yeah.  She's having a ball.  She's having a ball.
Story_ID: 128578
Speaker 1: And you know what else is the legacy? I must have meant something special to a lot of people because I got a call and I have this brand new client.  It's 2005, and a man called me named Michael Kaplan.  He said, "Audrey, I'm Michael Kaplan."  I said, "Steve Kaplan's son?"  He said, "yes."  I said, "we never met."  He said, "I know, but I know who you are.  My father told me to call you cause my brother and I started a store called FTF [Fashion to Figure] and what we need to know, my father said you already forgot, so that you need to help us with our store."  And I almost cried because forty years ago their grandfather hired me at Lane Bryant in 1965.  And in 2005, I'm getting a retainer that's quite handsome from the grandsons of the man who hired me so I can help them with their new retail store.  And that I knew their grandfather, their grandmother on both sides and that's, that's really forty--I've come full circle.  That's full circle for me.  I said, okay, that's it.  I don't need any more now, that's it and life is beautiful.
Story_ID: 128579
Speaker 1: The last question we always ask, is this one, it's similar to legacy but a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That I gave all of what I could give to you as an individual, that I gave it sincerely because I wanted to give it.  And I was very generous, very generous in many ways.  Um-hmm, I think I'm generous.  They've told me that a lot, you know I'm generous.  And that's nice to be generous, big tipper, big spender, big.  But the more I give, it keeps coming, you know.  And I'm not greedy, that's the best part.  You know people are greedy, they want it all.  Now listen, Larry, you cannot have it all.  Audrey, I want it all.  And I just look at them, Sweetheart you can't baby doll.  It doesn't happen that way.  You can't have it all and why would you want it all?  How boring if you had it all.  And I want to be perfect.  No, you cannot be perfect.  You can exceed and you can be excellent at what it is that you do but you cannot be perfect.  Why do people say they want to be perfect?  Ooh, boring!  You're the only one perfect in the whole wide world.  Who's perfect?  Looking for that perfect mate, the perfect husband, the perfect wife, the perfect child, doesn't happen.  (Laughter).  It really doesn't.  I don't like that word perfect.  And perfect--practice makes perfect.  Practice does not make perfect.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well you've been very generous with your time today.  Thank you very much.  It's been a pleasure.
Speaker 2: It was fabulous.  And we know so many people.  That's--we have a relationship.  We are related.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 128580
Speaker 1: Very early '40s [1940s], Raymond Bailey Smaltz, Jr., my oldest brother, very early.  I don't know how old he was but I think I was about--I'd say '41 [1941], '42 [1942].  Maybe he was eleven or twelve.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Audrey at about four years old.  That's the earliest picture I have of myself.
Speaker 2: Okay, in 1941.
Speaker 1: About '41 [1941], my brother, Mickey Kenneth Alfred Smaltz.  All three photos that you just saw taken at the same time in our apartment in the Harlem River Houses in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-seven, Essence magazine, I was fifty years old.  American Way magazine, 1989 maybe, 1990.  I'm not sure.  And they did a story on the Backstage Empress.  That's at fortieth birthday party, a surprise birthday party and I'm wearing a marvelous cotton gown, two-piece by Koos Van Den Akker.  And I--
Speaker 2: Was this the--this one?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes!
Speaker 2: That's the one that's--?
Speaker 1: Yes!
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I know what I'm watching.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Koos Van Den Akker, and I called it my titty dress.  You see my titties are out there.  That (unclear) year 1977.  Backstage at a fashion show at the Puck Building and the outfit is Edward Wilkerson, one of the top black designers of the world.  He worked for Donna Karan and Calvin Klein and that's when I met him many years ago.  And this is his line, made to order.  This is couture--Edward Wilkerson.
Speaker 2: About what year is this?
Speaker 1: The year, 1999.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm modeling at the Waldorf Astoria [Hotel, New York, New York] in a black eye lace gown and I don't remember who the designer is but it was a designer from Harlem.  And it's the mid, early '60s [1960s], early or mid-'60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm fifteen years old.  The dress is linen.  It's hot pink and pale pink and a red rose.  And the dress was so elegant I bought it at a thrift shop for about fifty cents.  I use to buy thrift clothes because I always wanted to wear designer clothes and if I couldn't afford it I, I'd go down to the white neighborhoods and go to the thrift shops where the white ladies sold their dresses.
Speaker 2: About what year is this (unclear)?
Speaker 1: I was fifteen so the year is thirty--fifty--what, '53 [1953] or '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Somewhere around there, '53 [1953], '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: (Unclear)?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.  Standing with, on my right, Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., and on my left or as I see it, well anyway, Mark T. Southall and it's 1962 and I'm running for Miss Beaux Arts and they were helping me with my campaign at the Democratic Club on 7th Avenue, that Adam was the head of that club and Mark T. Southall was the assemblyman I believe at that time, 1962.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: I'm in Augusta, Georgia working for Lena Horne Cosmetics as her executive director.  That's me with the white pearls around my neck, the black top, the patent leather and the black and white checked skirt, hair pulled back.  And I was talking to two of my students that I had trained in how to sell cosmetics and how to use cosmetics, 1962.  Talking to a young man teaching him about the Lena Horne beauty products and each product, probably a lotion I'm showing him, 1962, and still in Augusta, Georgia.  Vote for Miss Beaux Arts 1962, it was Schaefer Beer.  And we were the finalists in the Miss Beaux Arts contest.  There are eight of us, huh?  One, two, three, four--eight, and I'm in the middle.  That's me in the middle and just below me is one of my dearest friends, [Jacqueline] Jackie Gray Avant.  And here it is, we're still good--best of friends all these many years later.  Dee Simmons won that contest by the way.
Speaker 2: Is she in the (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dee Simmons is right here.  (Pointing to picture).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this is Jackie.  And of course that's me.  Oh you can't tell.  I shouldn't say of course honey cause you have--I have really changed over these years.  I look at these pictures, I say wow!  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Right--
Speaker 1: You know it was a composite.  This is a composite, a very early composite.  I was about fifteen or sixteen years old with the Grace Del Marco Model Agency.  I'd even say I was sixteen by this time.  And hair long, hair pulled back and then a full length shot.  This picture was on the cover of Jet, not like this but that same feeling.  It's a Chloe--
Speaker 2: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: This picture was on the cover of Jet, not this picture but the same feeling and the beautiful jacket by Chloe by Karl Lagerfeld and I'm wearing my famous diamond heart and my diamond and pearl earrings.  And the year, 1975.  The year, 1954, maybe 1955, and I'm in my pose, it's black and white with a flower.  That was my look in those days, full skirt.  Very full skirt, pulled in waistline.  I don't know who did the dress but it looks like a two-piece look and it was probably black and white 'cause I always liked black and white.  This is probably backstage at a fashion show.  You see I'm putting on my pantyhose, rolling one leg at a time.  I mean my (unclear) BP [ph.] must have taken this picture of me but I wasn't backstage.  I think I had just moved into my new headquarters 'cause there's nothing on the wall and stacks of everything are everywhere.  This my office back in 1977 and it's probably July or August '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-four [1974], maybe 1975, Spring Lake [Michican], doing a fashion show for Hart Schaffner and Marx.  And they made that suit for me and Lionel Hampton's band so I had fashions and all that jazz.  We did a benefit--well it wasn't a benefit, we got paid.  But I was with Ebony at the time and I got Lionel who was my date in those days and his band and they made all the clothes for the band and it was wonderful.  We did a fashion show.  I did the commentary.  That was great.  1978, '79 [1979], maybe 1980, a magazine, I don't remember the name of the magazine but it was a very nice story about me and a girl named Kai [ph.].  Oh, why shouldn't I remember her name?  Anyway, one of the young ladies who use to work for me who was also a stylist, she wanted to do this pic, this story about me so there it is.  All made up.  Al Grundy did my makeup.  One of my favorite pictures, the make up by Fran Cooper and I'm in a Chloe dress.  I have beautiful jewelry on.  I always liked good jewelry.  I very rarely wear costume jewelry so I had it all one. I have, I see my diamond bracelets, my diamond and tanzanite ring, my diamond earrings, everything.  You know I like, I like the real deal and I wear it over and over again.  I don't like inexpensive stuff.  Fran Cooper did my make up here too and I was going, I was going to be a guest model for a designer.  And I think this is 1984.  Let's say 1984, somewhere around there.  Al Grundy [ph.]--oh.  Al Grundy did my make up here.  Frenchie [ph.] did my hair and I would say this is 1980--looks like a 1980.  I'm in Chloe and you'll always see my ring.  I still have that ring till this day.  I love that ring.  My husband gave me that ring in 1969, 'cause I picked it out at Tiffany's.  I know what to pick out, um-hmm.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: (Laughs at photograph).  Nineteen seventy-eight [1978], you could just see part of the gown but it was a couture gown by Yves St. Laurent and if you can notice the hairstyle, all curly cues at Frenchie Cashmere.  And we're at Lincoln Center at some big affair and I was seated with Candice Bergen and Eugenia Sheppard.  It was very special.
Speaker 2: There's one more (unclear) this is--
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is cute.  This is cute.
Speaker 2: Oh a lot of (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a, you know.
Speaker 2: See if we can get the whole thing and maybe you can focus in on a couple of these.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is cute, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, start with the entire picture and then--
Speaker 1: Actually, yeah.  This is a contact sheet and there are lots of pictures of me.  And this picture, one of these pictures made the cover of Jet magazine when Jet was very small.  And I was--it's 1962, because Jet did a story on me when I was the first African American black woman, colored woman, whatever they call it to work for the New York Stock Exchange with Bache & Company so they, that was a big story.  I'm sorry I don't have the real Jet.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that was on a cover of Jet.  We didn't find it.  It was--you know we do everything last minute, but that's it.
Speaker 2: Hold it. I'm just going to (unclear).
Speaker 1: I love the little bow in her hair.  That is too funny.  I don't believe that bow.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Just sitting there, right?
Speaker 1: Oh my god, the bow.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's 1962, because--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's (unclear).
Speaker 1: I was busy in '62 [1962], I'm telling you.  I guess that's--it's hysterical.  Everything was going on in '62 [1962] for me.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)?
Speaker 1: Oh, I loved to swim.
Speaker 2: This is the last one.
Speaker 1: One more and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's enough.
Speaker 1: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: That bow was funny.  I can't believe what time it is.
Speaker 1: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay, this is the last one I think.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty [1980] maybe and we're at a friend's home up in Westchester [New York].  I can't think of his name but he was the president of a bank, really wonderful young man.  And I loved to swim so he had a sliding board that went right into the swimming pool.  And that's all I did was go up the sliding board, into the pool and no one was in the pool but me.  I mean everybody's at the party and I'm the only one in the pool.  Did I have fun?  I didn't know anybody was taking my picture in the backyard cause I loved to swim. Ain't nothing like having a sliding board to go right into the water, plump.  I loved to swim.
