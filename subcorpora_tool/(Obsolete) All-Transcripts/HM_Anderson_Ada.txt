Speaker 2: The one thing, when I organized the, the program for teenagers for the arts [Leadership Enrichment Arts Program] was what I always told them, you can find mediocrity any time--I mean, I'm starting to rephrase it. You can find mediocrity any place, any time but not on my time.  'Cause I wanted them to be exposed to the best and then they could do what they may with it.
Story_ID: 620296
Speaker 1: Now, I know you're anxious to tell me the different stories of your very wonderful life but I'd like to start with your family tree.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I understand that you're very knowledgeable in your family history.  So how far can you go back on the, your mother's [Cecilia Rucker Collins] side which is the Collins family, is that right?
Speaker 2: Rucker.
Speaker 1: Rucker.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You wanna start on the Rucker side or the Collins side?
Speaker 2: But now that I know a lot more about the Collins so we--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's start with the Collins (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) we can do the Ruckers.
Speaker 1: Oh, you wanna start with the--
Speaker 2: Either way, either way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's do the Collins first.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Now, how far back can you go in the Collins family?
Speaker 2: I'm the fifth generation.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I can go back five generations.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, then tell me about the, the Collins family, your great-great-grandfather, then, right?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I can kind of give you a good run down on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's fine.
Speaker 2: Okay.  As a matter of fact, our two great-grandmothers were both bought off the slave block in New Orleans [Louisiana], and brought straight to Travis County to Austin [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On the Collins side, my dad's [Walter Collins] side, the, Amanda Henders- Amanda Henderson had, and I can't think if I finally found the name of her husband but it was in, fascinating, intact family that had eight, eight children.  She had a husband.  And the, and the information that we've been given--and this was from a cousin and not from, directly from our aunts--so, was that Amanda and all of her children spoke German.  And that they were Pennsylvania Dutch (laughter) and this was a slave family that remained intact.  The youngest child, the eighth child, was fathered not by her husband but by a slaveholder who had come from, he was described as a gentleman, Pennsylvania Dutch gentleman who had come to town.  And that was the way it was written in our history.  His name was Reverend Ed Harrington [sic. William Harrington] and he lived in a suburb of Austin.  And I know a lot about him.  Excuse me, Amanda's youngest daughter was Sarah Elizabeth Harrington [Elizabeth Collins] as I, as I said was fathered by the Reverend Ed Harrington.  I have a copy of her marriage certificate to Newton Isaac Collins dated in 1854.  The ceremony was--(background noise) just take it off the hook.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Just a minute.
Speaker 1: The, on the marriage certificate it was signed by a witness, by Mr. and Mrs. Parson [ph.].  And the Parsons were the slaveholders and the ceremony was performed in a Methodist church.  And the, and the, the Reverend Ed Harrington, her father, (laughter) presided over the, the ceremony.  And I've been told some stories but it was that, it was from, by some cousins and, and it probably is true but I don't think I wanna go into that.  They had--she married, of course, Newton Isaac Collins and they had eight children and her name was Sarah Elizabeth Harrington and they had eight children and she died in child birth with the eighth child.  My grandfather [Dee Gabriel Collins] was two years old, which means that he, and, and so it, when the slaves were freed in Texas in 1865 he was just a little toddler.  And to help raise him was his oldest sister [Sevina Collins Bremond] who had gotten married.  It's a huge family (laughter) but I'll try to narrow it down.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The--to Newton Isaac's family.
Story_ID: 620297
Speaker 1: He married, Newton Isaac [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins] married Sarah Elizabeth [Elizabeth Collins].  His, but Dee Gabriel Collins [Dee Gabriel Collins] is my grandfather who was the youngest child who was a toddler when his mother died.  He married, and I have to go to the other side, my grandmother, you know, to get it straight.  She lived in a little town just north of Austin [Texas].  And--
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: Well, let me get, give you her mother [Clemmie Sauls] first--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --if you want that.  Her grandmother rather, her grandmother--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --(laughter) we go back.  Her grandmother was also bought off this, the slave block in, I mean, in New Orleans [Louisiana].  I don't know the year.  And I'm not certain about who fathered her daughter but her daughter, down now to number three in, in the, in the line, her daughter was father- fathered by a gentleman who had lots, (laughter) lots of land (laughter).  And I always mix up, 'cause there are two names involved, I'll think of it.  Anyway, and then, and then Dee Gabriel married--and her name was Donnie [Donnie Sauls Collins], they--no, we called her Donnie, but you spell it the same way, D-O-N-N-I-E.  There was a custom at that time at least with there, that the baby would be named for the first person who, who came after her birth, who came to visit.  Two people came to visit (laughter) my grandmother so it was Donnie Gladys Louise (laughter) what was her name?  I'll have to go back and get that name for you.  What was grandmother's name?  Anyway, I'll have to go back 'cause too far, too many names and too far away from it, I haven't worked on it in years so but matter of fact I haven't worked on it in three years.  And well you were gonna get the pictures you said later.  What else you wanna know?  Well, Donnie and Dee Gabriel, Donnie and Dee Gabriel had eighteen children.  The first two children were boys and died in infancy.  And the third or fourth--anyway another son way down the line was killed when he was fifteen.  He was, he and some white boys were throwing the hot coal and it hit him in the, in the, right here in the (unclear) temple (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) temple.
Speaker 1: And he died the next day.  And that same day grandmother gave birth to a daughter named Donnie [Donnie Collins Hutson], (laughter) she named her for herself.  All our names get recycled, we all are named (laughter) after somebody in the family. We also know something about Newton Isaac's [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins] background.
Speaker 2: You were gonna tell me something about, you said, you knew a lot about Ed Harrington [sic. William Harrington] as well.
Speaker 1: Well, with Ed Harrington he was in a little suburb of Austin [Texas] and his friend who was a slaveholder for my family had, he, he established, well, this is the way I know it, he established a school for girls, it was called the Parsons school for girls [Parsons Female Academy, Manor, Texas], and Ed Harrington was one of the trustees, so one would assume they were friends (laughter).  And that was how I found out that he actually had lived here.
Story_ID: 620298
Speaker 1: And Isaac--
Speaker 2: Newton Isaac [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins].
Speaker 1: Newton Isaac (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Where we start with Newton Isaac is in Alabama, born into slavery to Silas Collins [ph.] who came from Ireland.  And Newton Isaac was given a--Silas Collins hired a tutor to teach him to read and write when he was very young.  And when he was old enough he gave him a year's apprenticeship training as a carpenter and freed him.  Shortly after he freed him Silas died.  And he, he had Newton Isaac stayed on for a while to help out Silas' wife and her five children.  I don't know anything about them or what happened to them.  And in the meantime he had earned eighteen hundred dollars in gold coins working before he came to Texas.  And he knew a family in Texas, a colored family in Texas and so he came to Texas with his eighteen hundred dollars and was re-enslaved and that's where he met Sarah Elizabeth [Elizabeth Collins].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, when he was, when he was freed in 1865 he, he, he immediately established his own construction company and the way the, the written documents that we have reads that he built fine homes and churches throughout central Texas.
Story_ID: 620299
Speaker 1: In 1872 he [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins] purchased his first land, that's the first that we have, we're aware of.  And he bought ninety-two and a half acres.  And the improvements he put on it was, I mean, again I'm, I'm quoting from the written document, large two story house for his family, and a well, two barns, and a tenant house for a tenant to farm the land and while he was, his--he was working in his construction company.  And the tenant was supposed to, from when his sons got old enough from time to time teach them farming.  Newton Isaac also when they got old enough would take one and then another of his sons to teach them the building trade.  The land I told you has such fascinating bits to it.  The, the land he bought, the ninety-two and a half acres was part of the Henry Warnell tract.  Henry Warnell was one of the defenders of the Alamo [San Antonio, Texas].  And the, the land was land that the government gave him as a reward for his service at the Alamo.  My grandf- Newton Isaac purchased the land from Henry Warnell's heirs directly from, (laughter) to the heirs.  I was, when I started working on, on, on the family history I was really--oh, and the, the deed to that land said that it was three miles from Austin [Texas].  I found out that three miles from Austin meant three miles from the capital which meant something interesting was on that land currently.  And it was really interesting at how I learned that.  I had, I had gone down to the general land office to find out a little bit more about the history of that land and one, there was someone else, when I asked, when I asked my question of the, the worker there, the, the attendant, there was a customer sitting there who overheard my conversation and he said, "Lady," (laughter), "do, do you know who Henry Warnell was?"  "I don't have a clue."  And then he went on to tell me.  And he said, "You know, if I, my family owned any land," (laughter), "and it belonged to someone who had fought at the Alamo, I would tell everybody."  I said, "Oh, okay" (laughter).  But at any rate, they located the land and what was on it currently, (laughter) first of all, my own real estate office 'cause we later had a real estate business [Anderson Wormley Real Estate and Insurance Company, Austin, Texas], my, my own business, you know, over a hundred years after my great-grandfather had sold it.  And it extended into what was the old airport [Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, Austin, Texas]] which is now being redeveloped.  And so we recently--and, and by the way, he bought the ninety-two and a half acres but as land became available adjacent to his land, he purchased additional land to a total of a hundred fifty-six acres.  And so that 156 acres extended from our office at 3724 Airport Boulevard into the airport (laughter) which was, I was really delighted to learn (laughter).
Story_ID: 620300
Speaker 1: Continuing on the land story in--see that started out in 1872. In 1891 he [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins] traded the, the 196 acres for 506 acres at Pilot Knob [Texas] where I grew up.
Speaker 2: Where is Pilot Knob?  Where is that located?
Speaker 1: Pilot Knob is just south of Austin [Texas].  It used to be seven miles but it's less than that now.  And it's situated between--well, running through the land that he bought, it's Onion Creek which is a well known creek in this part of the world (laughter).  It has two waterfalls on it, major waterfalls.  I say major, major to, that's where I used to play but, (laughter) but it was major to me.  And it's between Onion Creek as I said and Cottonmouth Creek which is a very small creek that empties into Onion Creek.  The, it's just on, on the Cottonmouth Creek, the small creek, is the extinct volcano which to me as a little girl it was mountains.  And I'll show you when we, I have some of the rock from there.  I, they're like iron, I can't even lift any of 'em (laughter).  The, and, of course, little people like me were never permitted to go all the way up because it was, it was so rocky and rough, you know.  But it produced very, very fertile black land for, and it's very out, great land for farming.  So they used that, well, it was there (laughter).  And gradually, kind of partial way up you could, there, there was some that actually, cow, the cattle, the animals could graze on.  At the base of it and very near that creek, was a, the creek was a defining point was where my father, Dee Gabriel [Dee Gabriel Collins] built his home, it's really a beautiful, it was a beautiful home.  The--and I'll have to describe that home to you 'cause it's, it was quite amazing.
Story_ID: 620301
Speaker 1: But what Newt- what, going back to Newton Isaac [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins], when he bought it, he built his own house and just, very near his house he set aside an acre of land for a school [Pilot Knob Elementary School, Pilot Knob, Texas], a church, and a cemetery and he built this one room schoolhouse and at that time the, there was no public money for African Americans and he hired the teacher, he put all the, the desks and everything in it, 1891. And he hired the teacher and we always say they hired the teacher and hired the preacher, we, it was a Methodist church going back to this Methodist wedding (laughter).  And the, you know, the, they came I think maybe twice a month or something like that, it wasn't full time and, you know, the history of that and, you know, in the country how that was done.  The, I have a picture of it when I must have been three years old maybe, out by the church (laughter) and my, I had three older brothers [Walter Collins, Talford Collins and Edgar Collins] and so my brothers were there.  And it was made up, we had such a big family most of it was family (laughter) in the, in the school and in the church.  An interesting tidbit about the, the school, I attended that same--my parents [Cecilia Rucker Collins and Walter Collins], my father attended that school, I attended that same school until I was, through the third grade or maybe it was through the second.  And, and then Rosenwald school [Julius Rosenwald Fund] came in and built--there, we always, I mean, I always thought as a little girl that they built it, what they did was provided $250 (laughter) and the county gave like two, two thousand five hundred [dollars], I think.  And this community, the black community that it was going to serve had to put in the rest and that was five hundred dollars.  And I remember that my mother headed up the, the fundraising for the land, (cough) excuse me, and they, they, you know, and it was in the middle of the Depression [Great Depression], see I was born in 1921, you just think about it (laughter).  And nobody had any money but they would have what they call box suppers and somebody would play music and the guys would bid on the box, you know what a box supper is?
Speaker 2: No, ma'am.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The girls would prepare food in a box and decorate the box real pretty and then the guys would bid on it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then they would, they would have, you know, just like we still do in the churches, they'd, they'd have those plates that they sell, you know, a plate of food, what did we call it?  I forgot what we called it.  And we would go from, well, anyway that's part of the lifestyle I was about to get into.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: Oh, and I learned one thing when I started to write the, the research for the book, I discovered for the first time that the, we didn't have a high school there so we came to Austin [Texas] and the African Americans would stay with relatives or ride in with somebody or whatever.  And I discovered that there was a bus that the white students were being bused from our community.  And I just learned that.  I was mad (laughter).
Story_ID: 620302
Speaker 1: Let's go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there's some more to that.
Speaker 1: --let's go back to Newton Isaac [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins]--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --and his time.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: When Newton Isaac bought the, the first land, he put it in the name of himself and all of his children.  And when he bought the land at Pilot Knob [Texas], he deeded his children their portion of the land and free and clear.  And helped them to whatever extent to build their homes, and they all built very, very lovely homes.  The, and then Newton Isaac after (laughter) everybody was settled in, Newton Isaac went to California, his oldest son was in California, and I don't know the history of that and how all of that came about, in Los Angeles [California], and Newton Isaac went to Los Angeles and stayed for ten years.  And I didn't know that until I saw a copy of those deeds.
Speaker 1: Where was his wife?
Speaker 2: She, okay, going back to his wife, she died--
Speaker 1: Oh, in childbirth?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: With the last child?
Speaker 2: Right.  Now, he married again and that marriage didn't last.  What I've been told is that she was, she was mean to his children so he, he, he fired her, (laughter) he divorced her.  But he married again and Adeline [ph.] was her name.  And he, I think, I don't have any record of actual, of their actual marriage time but on the deed that the land that he, the first land he bought in 1872, he, it was only his name when he bought the ninety-two and a half acres.  And when he bought the additional acreage her name was also on it.  And in the cemetery that I described to you that was built, next to him is a grave that says Mrs. Collins, (laughter) we don't know which one but it would had to have been Adeline 'cause he didn't own that land when, when Sarah Elizabeth [Elizabeth Collins] died.  So I'm, you know, deducting (laughter) that that would have been who it was.
Speaker 1: So Dee Gabriel [Dee Gabriel Collins] is the son of--
Speaker 2: Is the youngest son of Newton Isaac.
Speaker 1: Newton Isaac.
Speaker 2: And my grandfather.
Speaker 1: And your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandfather was deeded some of that land, that 506 acres?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.  And, and some of the siblings sold their land to other siblings.  Now, the interesting thing that happened with Newton Isaac's daughters when they married then they traded, traded or sold or whatever their land to somebody else in the family and used that money to purchase land in Manchaca [Texas].  Manchaca Road is, is a major thoroughfare and it was right on Manchaca Road.  And they had a little over a hundred acres, a 112, a 120, something like that, which was given to the college when they died.  That, that one of them.  Another one--
Speaker 1: Given to which college?
Speaker 2: Oh, Huston Tillotson [Huston Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's a story about the colleges--which is an all-black college [HBCU].  The, so that was the end of that that land of that daughter.  Her, her name was--too many names now. Lillie, Lillie--anyway she was Lillie, her married name was Polk, P-O-L-K, Lillie Polk [ph.].
Story_ID: 620303
Speaker 1: Gabriel--
Speaker 2: Dee Gabriel [Dee Gabriel Collins] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Dee Gabriel, who does he marry?
Speaker 2: He married (pronunciation) Donnie,  Donnie [Donnie Sauls Collins]--
Speaker 1: Donnie.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were gonna describe for me the house that he built, is that right?
Speaker 2: I'll show you a picture of it.  It's a picture of just half of the house (laughter) but it was a two story and they had, you want just kind of describe that whole thing?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Because I loved my [paternal] grandparents (laughter).  And my, okay, the, my grandfather, let me, let me tell you this.  My grandfather used to come I think every morning (laughter) when I was just a toddler, he'd come in his buggy (laughter), one horse buggy, and pick me up, and my mother [Cecilia Rucker Collins] would, I would always put powder on the cheek he was going to kiss (laughter).  I loved them.  But anyway (laughter) to describe the, the property, (laughter) the, and along with it kind of the lifestyle, you know, some of the things, family. He had, as, as I said this very lovely house well, with all of those children, there was actually fifteen that grew to adulthood and so forth. In all he had sixteen.  He built--and so the girls lived upstairs and there was one bedroom downstairs that the girls occupied.  And upstairs I always thought it was like a, a big, a big dormitory 'cause it wasn't, it was just one big room and they had these small beds (laughter) like a dormitory.  And the back, just a few yards from the, from the back porch he built another house, it was just one room and I don't remember it ever being painted (laughter) for the boys.  And they, (laughter) it was again like bunks, you know, those small twin beds lined (laughter) up there.  This place had running water and electricity in a farm which was very unusual.  He had, he had had a well and next, attached to the well was a little house, something that housed a battery, a, a Delco--I mean, generator, a Delco generator.  And he also had a windmill.  When there was sufficient wind to generate the electricity for the house and the farm then that's what they used.  When there was not enough wind then the generator would kick on.  And so they had electricity.
Story_ID: 620304
Speaker 1: Grandmother [Anderson's paternal grandmother, Donnie Sauls Collins] loved flowers, fresh flowers.  So I used--help, in quotes, (laughter) help her plant 'em and then help her cut 'em 'cause she always, she was one of these immaculate, they both were, everything was immaculate, and--I didn't get that from her--and the, (laughter) she always had fresh flowers on the dining room table and generally a bowl of fruit depending on what the time of year on the, on the buffet.  I'm a deviate a little bit, you know, how I felt, my personal feelings.  And over the buffet hung a painting, it was a still life of fruit, a bowl of fruit but I--and she always gave, (laughter) gave me a snack in, in the midmorning, midafternoon.  And it would be, one of the things I remember so well she gave me a lot of different stuff but I always remember we had a mulberry tree and we'd pick these mulberries (laughter), I mean, mulberries and cream (laughter) out of the refrigerator.  I guess you'd call it an icebox.  And anyway I would stare at that (laughter).  And I remember my little, little feet, you know, I would, swing them back and forth.  And I came to realize that that was my first interest in art and that's why you saw that, the art exhibit ['Our New Day Begun'] that I put on at the LBJ Library [Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: Did you ever find out who the artist was of that--
Speaker 1: Unh-uh, unh-uh--
Speaker 2: --that painting?
Speaker 1: --unh-uh.  It's still hanging there.
Speaker 2: So the house is still there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I don't know who the artist is.  My brother bought the family home and--one of my brothers--and his widow lives there now and it's still hanging there.  But let me finish this, this place.  What I would do every, every evening was hold my grandfather's [Dee Gabriel Collins] (laughter) hand and we would go and turn the hydrants on. They had those big cement troughs, and we'd turn the first one on, it was for the chickens and turkeys and all the fowl.  And then we would go to the barn area. Well, first we would pass, he had a long metal shed and he had surreys and buggies in it.  So everybody, that was transportation before they had automobiles.  And so we would go past that, everything just as neat as it could be, and then we would go into the barn area where the animals would come and we'd turn the water on for them.  Now, in that barn area he had a shed and all of the harness for the mules and saddles for, for the horses were all hung just as neat as (laughter) it could--it was the neatest place (laughter) I don't have that but (laughter) I wish. My daughter [Sandra Anderson Baccus] does, oh, god, she really does.  And she also has a love of art too that's come on down.  But I would help grandmother cut these flowers, you know, for the, for the table, buffet, wherever.  Anyway those were some of those really happy day.

Speaker 1: But the other thing that I wanted to tell you about Dee Gabriel and Donnie [Anderson's paternal grandparents, Dee Gabriel Collins and Donnie Sauls Collins] is that, and I think that came actually it was handed, I think it was handed down by Newton Isaac [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins] but the boys worked outside, the girls did not do any kind of farm work, they were not permitted to, they worked inside and they learned all of the, the things that are feminine.  They, they, they made that, their wedding gowns which were beautiful, I have pictures of those wedding gowns.  They made everything, they made these gorgeous dresses.  And then there was also, going back to the house, in front of the house just beyond the, the, the, the, the well that I described, just beyond that was a fenced in garden, huge garden, girls took care--the, the men plowed it and did all of that but the women took care of, you know, that's where, they, that was their job.  And then that was really which is the east of the house.  On the north side was the orchid--orchards, (laughter) I can't get the words out, peaches, plums, pears, and that was, I think there was an apple tree but this is not real apple country.  But the girls would, would can it.  Oh, and we always thought of those yellow Elberta peaches, and we liked, I liked 'em ripe and juicy where it got all over you (laughter).

Speaker 1: When his [Anderson's paternal grandfather, Dee Gabriel Collins] children married, the older children married, he would build them a house on the land that he owned and rent to them enough so they could start farming.  He'd also give them enough, this, the equipment, you know, the plows, I think it was the horses, a horse, and mules.  I think in all he built, let me see, two, three, four, five, it was either five or six houses.  And most of them were just exactly alike, two bedrooms, a bath, a kitchen, a kitchen dining together, and a living room, front porch, and a little, and a back porch, and dig 'em a well.  So when they got married they had that starter home.  The house I grew up in was sitting on a rocky hill which my, my dad [Walter Collins] must have selected it 'cause he loved that hill because you'd get all the breeze.  So ours had a porch, a large front porch all the way across. That was my dad's favorite thing.  And then we had really three bedrooms, a porch, back, a long back, back porch that was screened in, and this large kitchen dining room.  And they, we heated with wood, we had these wood heaters to heat by and a wood heater, wood heat to cook by.  The kitchen and dining, the dining room was large, anticipating a large family, which we had later (laughter).  And I remember there was a lot of music around.

Speaker 1: Tell me about Dee Gabriel [Dee Gabriel Collins] and Donnie's [Donnie Sauls Collins] children?  Can you list their--
Speaker 2: The other children?
Speaker 1: The other children besides your, your father [Walter Collins]?
Speaker 2: The--Aunt Maude [Maude Collins], who was the--Maude, was the oldest surviving child, and she went to Samuel Huston College [Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas], graduated in 1914.  And she taught elementary school first and she went back to school to take some additional work and became a librarian in the high school, it was Anderson High School, L.C. Anderson High School [Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: L.C. Anderson or E.H.?
Speaker 2: L.C. Anderson.  That was one of your mistakes you had in this (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --in that file.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, and through the efforts of, of me and one of my neighbors, when they closed the L.C. Anderson High School because of integration, we, we succeeded shall I say (laughter) through much effort, just the two of us, she, and she taught in the schools so her face couldn't show up so it was only mine showing up.  But there's a school very near here up on the hill named L.C. Anderson High School, one of the few in the, in the country where in the most prestigious area of town it's named for an African American.  And at the time that it was dedicated his, his daughter, L.C. Anderson's daughter and three granddaughters were still living with, attended the, the dedication.
Speaker 1: Who was the next child?
Speaker 2: And it, and it opened, the school opened with an African American principal and an African American basketball coach.  And I think there might have been some other African American teachers there too.  And he is one of the ones I want you to interview.
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you're talking about Charles--
Speaker 2: Akin?
Speaker 1: --Akins [sic. HistoryMaker William Akins], yes.
Speaker 2: Without an S [sic.] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Story_ID: 620308
Speaker 1: Who, who was the next sibling after Maude [Anderson's paternal aunt, Maude Collins]?
Speaker 2: After Maude was Aunt, Aunt Bertha [Bertha Collins Rucker].  And Aunt Bertha got married and to, to my mom's brother, (laughter) Loomis Rucker and they moved to, to Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: So Bertha married your uncle?
Speaker 2: So my mom's brother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Brother.
Speaker 2: --and my dad's sister, makes us double cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you're also gonna find out that my Aunt Ada [Ada Collins Rucker] married my mom's brother, Uncle Ed [Edward Rucker] (laughter).  So we've got three sets of double cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You see, you know, you know, you know, the thing about it is that at that time there were very few African Americans in Austin [Texas] and these were two large families with similar backgrounds who were friends and so they grew up as friends.  And so, so there was these, these three (laughter) double, two, my mom [Cecilia Rucker Collins] and her two brothers married (laughter) my dad's two sisters.  And then it was kind of interesting there was a fourth one that got interested, fourth Rucker who was interested, I mean, fourth Collins who was interested in a Rucker and both of their parents, both of their fathers said as I express it, "Enough already" (laughter).  But--
Speaker 1: So we have Maude, Bertha, Ada, are there any more children?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  Yeah, I have a list of 'em I can give you, and I usually know it right off.  Maude, Bertha, Ada, I'll have to give you that later.  And I do know it but I think I'm too hungry (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, would you like to stop (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Maybe I need to take a break.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We'll, we'll--
Speaker 2: Go get something, that's why I got a headache probably.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There is a picture of Aunt Maude that, and her class that appeared in the newspapers when she was teaching elementary school, you know, many years ago.  And it has been used and framed, used many times in Black History Month (laughter).  It was hanging in some white restaurants, it's down at the library. I don't know what it was about that picture that they were so fascinated by.  She was quite young then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And very pretty, (laughter) very pretty lady.
Speaker 2: When we stopped before we were naming Dee Gabriel and Donnie's children and we had gotten through Maude, Bertha, and Ada.  What were the other children's names?
Speaker 1: Just go on and let me read 'em now. I'm still, you know, and I've known those all my life, I could just (makes sound) rattle 'em off, okay.  Is it okay for me to read it--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in here?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's fine.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Dee, Dee Gabriel Collins, that's D double E, Donnie Louise Collins [Donnie Sauls Collins], my grandparents, and their children were Silas [Silas Collins], Edward [Edward Collins], both of whom died in infancy.  Maude Esther, Lizzie or Elizabeth [Elizabeth Collins Turner], Elizabeth actually her middle name is Mae, Elizabeth Mae, Bertha Violet, and Talford [Talford Collins], T-A-L-F-O-R-D, middle initial Dee, D double E, middle name rather D double E, he was called Bud.  And then there's Walter Gabriel [Walter Collins], Ada Pumphrey, J.B. [John Collins], he was, but his real name was John Bill, Alge, A-L-G-E, Morris [Alge Collins], Charles Emory [Charles Collins], Theodore Roosevelt [Theodore Collins], we kind of liked those presidents, Lura [Lura Collins Isaacs], L-U-R-A, middle initial Thelma, I mean, middle name.  And then there's Donnie Gladys [Donnie Collins Hutson], and Gertrude Hortense [Gertrude Collins Winn] and she was known as Gert, Aunt Gert.  And James Kuyendoll [James Collins], K-U-Y-E-N-D-O-L-L, Virgie Clemmie [Virgie Collins], C-L-E-M-M-I-E.  And Myrtle Viola [Myrtle Collins Brooks] is number eighteen.
Speaker 2: And your father was?
Speaker 1: And my father was Walter Gabriel.
Story_ID: 620309
Speaker 1: So now, Walter Gabriel [Walter Collins] marries who?
Speaker 2: Cecilia, C-E-C-I-L-I-A, middle initial I, she never would tell us her name, she didn't like it (laughter), Rucker [Cecilia Rucker Collins], her last name was Rucker, R-U-C-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  Is there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mom, my mom always signed her name C.I. Collins.  And although my--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  She can just reference that document that (unclear).
Speaker 2: My, my middle name is Cecilia, I never saw her spell it (laughter).  I never remember (unclear) (laughter) spelling it.  Anyway because I wasn't sure whether, there are two different spellings you can have and I wasn't quite sure, I said, "Which one is mine?"
Speaker 1: I just want you tell us what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was the last one I called Donnie Hortense [Anderson's paternal aunt, Donnie Collins Hutson] (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, we, we did all of them (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I did all of them.
Speaker 1: You, yes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Myrtle Viola [Myrtle Collins Brooks].
Speaker 1: You were, you were just finished telling me your mother's name, that your father, your mother and father they then married.  And I want you to make reference to what you're reading from.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) This is something that I prepared for a family reunion and the, my Aunt Ada [Ada Collins Rucker] left us this genealogy and so that is what I'm reading. It's a very detailed genealogy.
Story_ID: 620310
Speaker 1: So now tell me about your mother and father.  And I, I understand that your family had a, a home on Pilot Knob [Texas]; is that right?
Speaker 2: Pilot Knob (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And tell me, you, you described your, your [paternal] grandfather's [Dee Gabriel Collins] house, but tell me about the home in which you lived?
Speaker 2: Where I lived?  Oh, I described it.
Speaker 1: Was that the house that you described?
Speaker 2: That had the long (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) oh, I see, that was your house.
Speaker 2: --yeah, the long porch that was--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I, I, I'm--
Speaker 2: --where I grew up.  And, and let me tell you something else about that growing up there.  The--we were facing the, the Knob, we were facing east so we had that afternoon shade.  At night, sometimes at night, if the, you know, the every, the, the, the conditions and the, the wind and so on, it was kind of still and (unclear) all the conditions were right, we could hear the people talk, we couldn't understand what they were saying, we were up on the Knob and we could also see the light, they were digging for gold.  They, there had been a rumor that two, there were two rumors, one was that the Indians [Native American] buried some gold (laughter) there and other treasures.  And the other one was that, I guess, the bad guys (laughter) buried a treasure there so they were always looking for treasure (laughter) up there.  This, by the way is one of the, so at night, we could, we could hear them, you know.  This is one of the, one of the, as I told you, extinct volcanoes and the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] geology students always go out, that's part of their training is out there on that, on that Knob.  We call it the Knob.  When I was growing up it was nothing but black rock, you really didn't see any vegetation to, to amount to anything.  And it just shocked me when I would go out there and see it covered in blue violets, all blue.  And now it's covered in trees and all kinds of greenery.  So it just shows you how there's soil built out, you know, over time through erosion and stuff began to grow.  Take, there's also a huge water tank that's, it's kind of hidden on, kind of over the hill, right off a main highway that provides water for the communities below us, running water.  On that land, going back to the land a little bit, is that these, we still have Onion Creek, nineteen plus acres undivided land after all of this time.  And the, it was set aside for the, all of the family, wherever they lived on the property to come and, one to graze the animals in the wintertime but the other thing was to cut wood, cut those oak trees down for wood for heating and for cooking.  And that was just open for all the family to use, so it's still there undivided.  And it's been leased by a company that, a gravel company, and they have been making, using it to, because it's all rock, (laughter) make gravel.
Story_ID: 620311
Speaker 1: Walter [Anderson's father, Walter Collins] and--
Speaker 2: Cecilia [Anderson's mother, Cecilia Rucker Collins] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Cecilia.  Okay.  I got that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: My family--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so now let's talk about your siblings.  Let's, let's list them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Dee, his name is Walter Dee [Walter Collins].  Talford Gabriel [Talford Collins], Edgar Roosevelt [Edgar Collins], and Ada Cecilia [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson], Pearl Marie [Pearl Collins Norris], Joe Loomis [Joe Collins], well, we call him J.B., his name is Jerome Boyd [Jerome Collins, Sr.].  And Gertrude Ida [Gertrude Collins Wormley], we call her Trudy.  And Thelma Jean [Thelma Collins] and we call her Jean (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's nine.
Story_ID: 620312
Speaker 1: Before we go on with more about your life and, and growing up there, let's talk about the, the Rucker family, more about them.  We only alluded to the fact that some of them married into the Collins family.  So let's start with, as your great-grandmother, I think you've already talked about them being bought off the auctioning block in New Orleans [Louisiana] as well.  Let's, let's take it from there.
Speaker 2: Now that was all on the Collins side I was talking about--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --'cause I got a grandfather and a grandmother (laughter) so that was the grandmother and grandfather on the Collins side.  I know, I don't know nearly as much about the Ruckers, they didn't leave us anything in writing.  My grandmother's name is Ida Perry Rucker, that's my mom's mother.  Her mother was, I can't even think of her name but and the story that I had, I had, totally unable to confirm and I wasn't, when I started, started this project it was only one sister still living and she said--well, we're, what I did know was that Grandmother Rucker was born in a county west of Austin [Texas], my mind is going blank.  I'll, I'll tell you the county in a minute, Blanco County [Texas], near President Johnson's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] home, near the Johnson property.  In fact, it's really all part of that same area, Fredericksburg [Texas] but she was in Blanco.  And we've had a number of different stories.  They said that she was, and I can't figure that out but that her birth mother, her birth parents were not the Perrys [Ann Moss Perry and Chatham Perry], that it was some Germans and I can't figure it out.  The, the courthouse burned down now so I can't, I haven't figured out how to find the records 'cause I don't know how to find it in the census 'cause I don't know what she was called.  So I, (laughter) I'm still working on that, still trying to figure that out.  But at any rate the Perrys raised her and as the oldest child and then they went on to have fifteen more children.  No birth control in those days (laughter).  The, and they owned almost four hundred acres on Manchaca Road right across the road from where my dad's great aunt had, had bought land. (Background noise) I thought I'd cut that thing off.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Miss Perry, who, I thought one of them were bought off the auction block as well?
Speaker 2: One of 'em was what?
Speaker 1: Was, was bought off the auction block on the Rucker side (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was talking about the two Collins, the male--
Speaker 1: Oh, the two--
Speaker 2: --and the female Collins.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Great-grandparents.
Speaker 1: All right.  To just clarify Miss Perry was your great-grandmother and Ida Rucker was your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And I never saw a picture of him, of, of Miss Perry's husband.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't know what he looked like.
Speaker 1: And you, and you don't know her first name?
Speaker 2: I can't think of it.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I think it's in, I think it's in, I got some stuff in that same book, same book.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I get to it.
Speaker 1: Well, your grandmother, Ida Rucker, was married to--
Speaker 2: I've got it in the, in the big book that I made, so.
Speaker 1: But Ida Rucker was married to who?
Speaker 2: David Rucker.
Speaker 1: David, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And David Rucker has a, I know more about his story, which isn't much, than I do her story, you know, for sure, about her story.  The, and my, by the way, my parents [Cecilia Rucker Collins and Walter Collins] never talked about anything related to slavery.  It would have been easy if, easy for us to have grown up not knowing slavery existed, we just knew that there was segregation, you know, we were aware of it.  And I learned all of this stuff later.  And I, I always thought when I was a little girl 'cause I wasn't stupid, I knew there had to (laughter) have been some slaves in the family, you know, or else how did I, why do I look like this?  But (unclear) I don't know that I even related it to that, it was just, you know, it just didn't make any sense.  So I decided they didn't tell us because they didn't wanna talk about that their ancestors being born out of wedlock and that was what I made up for myself when I was, you know, (gesture) yay high.  So that's why a lot of those things that normally parents will tell children, not my mom and dad.
Story_ID: 620313
Speaker 1: So you were gonna tell me a story about David Rucker, what you know about him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  David Rucker was born in Tennessee in slavery, was taught to read and write early on, he too had a tutor, isn't that amazing?  And then he was freed.  And best that we've been able to determine from the papers that we have from, from the war department [U.S. Department of War] is that he was freed between the ages of ten and twelve, was very young.  I don't know when exactly he came to Texas but he came to Texas and he was a Buffalo Soldier, I have a painting in there and I guess more or less served all the, you know, until he married my grand- grandmother [Ida Perry Rucker].  Knew nothing about farming (laughter) and my grandmother knew everything about farming so she insisted on, (laughter) on being on a farm.  But he helped to, he was one of the, one of the black folks who helped to build the Austin capitol [Texas State Capitol, Austin, Texas].  And he, the other little, you know, little things that Ma dear would talk about and that I remember was he liked to cook.  And I don't think he ever, had ever lived on a farm growing up.  And she would tell me some of the things that he liked to cook.  Loved to read, they said he used to read on horseback, (laughter) read all the time.
Story_ID: 620314
Speaker 1: They [Anderson's maternal grandparents, Ida Perry Rucker and David Rucker] really believed in education and their oldest son who was Loomis [Loomis Rucker] (laughter) that married, that married the Collins [Bertha Collins Rucker], the, he graduated, I told you I have his certificate from college, his diploma copied, I have the real diploma, the original diploma.
Speaker 2: What school did he go to?
Speaker 1: Sam- Tillotson [Tillotson College, Austin, Texas].  There were two black schools [HBCUs], one was Samuel Huston [Samuel Huston College, Austin, Texas] and one was Tillotson, they merged and now it's Huston Tillotson [Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas], so you will hear me using those names kind of interchangeably but he graduated from Tillotson.  Aunt Maude [Maude Collins], my dad's sister, graduated from, the same year, from Samuel Huston.  But the oldest child in each family was sent to college.  On the Collins side my grandfather [Dee Gabriel Collins] put most of the girls in the dormitory at Tillotson.  And, you know, like, like I said that there were so few blacks, so few people (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --as I was saying, 'cause people would say, "Weren't nobody here."  That, you know, he didn't want his girls sitting around on the farm so most of--especially the younger ones. So that was what they did.
Story_ID: 620315
Speaker 1: Now tell me the children of--
Speaker 2: The Ruckers?
Speaker 1: Yes, Ida [Ida Perry Rucker] and David [David Rucker].
Speaker 2: Silas--I don't mean Silas, Loomis Simon [Loomis Rucker], (laughter) Eddie [Edward Rucker], I can't remember his name, I'll give it, I need to stick with the first name, Johnny [John Rucker], trying to keep 'em in order, Musidora [Musidora Rucker Grant], isn't that a beautiful name?  (Laughter) M-U-S-I-D-O-R-A.  Pearl [Pearl Rucker], Annie [Annie Rucker Baker], Elmira [Elmira Rucker], Kisiah [Kisiah Rucker], and David [David Rucker].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both of my grandfathers died young.
Speaker 1: So and then Cecilia [Cecilia Rucker Collins] is your mother, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, wait a minute.  I gave you the, gave you the three, those first three men, (laughter) the boys, then Cecilia and then Cornelia [Cornelia Rucker], and then Musidora, and then Annie, Elmira, and Kisiah, and David.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Is that twelve?  It should be.
Story_ID: 620316
Speaker 1: So now we, we are down to your mother [Cecilia Rucker Collins] and father [Walter Collins] unless there is anything else you wanna tell us about your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So let's talk about your parents, now.
Speaker 2: I did, I don't think I told you, going back to my grandparents, I don't think I told you that the, the highway that runs from the McKinney Falls Parkway to all the way to just behind the airport is named for Dee Gabriel [Anderson's paternal grandfather, Dee Gabriel Collins], it's Dee Gabriel Collins Road.
Speaker 1: Oh.  All right.
Speaker 2: It's a county road.
Speaker 1: And when, when was it named?
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: When was it named for him?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would say fifteen plus years ago.  It was originally named, from the very beginning it was named Collins Road.  And then without our knowledge the county changed it to Scenic Loop, and when we finally realized it, it was actually because we saw it on the map and so then we got it changed that, this time, they changed to Dee Gabriel.
Speaker 1: But that is, was that part of the land that the Collins family owned at one time?
Speaker 2: Still owns.
Speaker 1: They still own?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Still owns.  Somebody in the Collin- somebody in the family owns all, all of it.  It's divided now so that each one owns his own part but if they sell it they tend to sell it to another family member (laughter) so it's, it stayed in the family.  And, and most of, most of those who stayed on the farm acquired additional acreage beyond the original 506.  Three brothers stayed on the farm and that was, and, and which included my dad.  The, with my generation, one brother stayed on the farm and that's it.  So he's a, and he's acquired a lot of land.  He's, he loves, I mean, land was apparently just played a real important part in our, in our family history because that was the one avenue through which ex-slaves could, could, you know, could acquire some property.  The, one of the, Dee Gabriel's brothers, you know, looking at that line, George Collins [ph.] built a house in Austin [Texas] which is really a lovely place, it's still standing.  And I don't know how much of the construction was done, I'm assuming it was all done probably by the construction company but he, he taught all of his, his, his boys something about construction.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: He, meaning Newton Isaac [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins] taught all of his boys.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, I'm not saying that about Dee Gabriel.  Dee Gabriel died rather young.
Speaker 1: Now, there's also land that's dedicated to Newton Isaac that was recently done. Was that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well that was the, that was the first land that he purchased after--
Speaker 1: The nine--
Speaker 2: --slavery.
Speaker 1: --the ninety-two and a half acres?
Speaker 2: The first purchase was ninety-two and a half acres.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And then he added to it in subsequent years until he got a hundred fifty-six acres.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that was the land I described the improvements on, that he put on it.
Speaker 1: But it was just dedicated in his name, is that right?
Speaker 2: Well, they just found out he, they just found out he was one of the owners (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, but I'm, I'm just, I'm--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that that's it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) trying to make the point that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's it.  I have--
Speaker 1: --that's the property that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have a--
Speaker 1: --you have a picture of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have a, yeah--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 620317
Speaker 1: There was something else I wanted to tell you about the land.  Oh, the thought went away.  Oh, when I was talking about the schools one of the important things I did not tell you about the schools.  I told you that he purchased the desks, well, the, you know, and all the equipment, well, when they built the Rosenwald school which was the two be--two bedroom--the two teacher school that, the three rooms, two classrooms and a space for a lunch room, a library or whatever, not that there was a library, you know, how many books. And we, (laughter) it was just empty, it was no equipment.  But I sat at that desk, those were the same desks that they brought over from, that Newton Isaac [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins] purchased they brought to the new school.  And the last of the family to, to attend were my brother's children. My nieces and nephews were the last ones to attend that school and that was when they integrated and they closed the school.  Well, when they closed it, one of my nephews brought his own desk where he had carved his name (laughter) and kept it and he still has it.  I had a check to verify, you know, the date on it, it was one of the original ones purchased in 1891 from, from, by Newton Isaac.  Isn't that a neat story?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: My dad [Walter Collins] sat there, I sat there, (laughter) my nieces and nephews sat there.  And I have a picture of them outside of the school where my dad looked like he was about six years old.  You can't see anything about the school. They're just on some planks standing up but they was just school kids.
Speaker 2: Now, let me understand about the school--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Newton Isaac first built the school and then Rosenwald--
Speaker 1: Newton Isaac built the school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, and--
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: --hired a teacher.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then the Rosenwald [Julius Rosenwald Fund] came in and--
Speaker 1: And contributed its, (laughter) so it's, it's called a Rosenwald school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Rosenwald school.
Speaker 1: There are a number of Rosenwald schools scattered around in the country.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And there's this big effort to, to renovate them and, and, and well, I'm not, I guess renovate is not the word I'm looking for. Restore them and preserve them.  And one of the, there's a black woman who was with the public library and that was one of the things that she did.  And I--she's not with the library now but I think she's continuing to do that 'cause she has a real passion that they be preserved.
Story_ID: 620318
Speaker 1: And do you know who Rosenwald [Julius Rosenwald] was?
Speaker 2: Yes, you can tell us.
Speaker 1: He was, it wasn't J.C. Penney, it was Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], the president of Sears, is that right?  I think that's right.  We need to check that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think it was Sears.  And that was his foundation [Julius Rosenwald Fund].  I think he also did some, helped out some churches too.  But anyway he did those schools all over.  And my first teaching job I told you when I graduated from college [Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] was Lockhart [Texas] which is just south of Austin [Texas], and I didn't know it was a Rosenwald school until very recently that, in recent years.  You know, there's none.  You know, they never talked about it.  And it was a two story stucco and it's still standing.
Speaker 2: Was there a name for the school?
Speaker 1: Lockhart School.
Speaker 2: Lockhart?
Speaker 1: Lockhart High School [Lockhart Vocational High School, Lockhart, Texas], Lockhart School.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I mean, the school that was on, on the Knob?
Speaker 1: On Pilot Knob [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Pilot Knob.
Speaker 1: The Pilot Knob School [Pilot Knob, Texas].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the, they renamed the, running from, from the highway past the school was renamed School House Road [ph.] (laughter).  And some of the land just beyond that where, where Newton Isaac's home stood that got sold to somebody outside of the family and so it's like a mini subdivision along there, just that one street, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: So some of the land got sold to others.  And what has happened to the, to the Rosenwald school now is that a group of Hispanics, excuse me, family bought it. It's on two acres of land and it goes on down to Onion Creek, great property, great property.  So they were able to acquire the property behind it that goes all the way to the creek.  And they've taken that, that old schoolhouse and made a house, they've done all kind, they have a village, (laughter) they have all kinds of things they've built there now.  And there's another one of the houses that that Newton Isaac [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins] built that is still standing but it got sold to somebody outside of the family and so now they have a lock on the gate and you can't get on there.  But I do have a picture of it.  That was my Uncle Charlie's [Charles Collins] house.
Story_ID: 620319
Speaker 1: And if you think about other stories we can always go back but I'd like to move forward to talk about your mother [Cecilia Rucker Collins] and, and father [Walter Collins].  So tell me about your mother.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Ma dear was, Ma dear was multitalented, (laughter) multi- she was interested in many things.  She, cooking was not in, necessarily her favorite thing to do, though, though she was a good cook.  She would much rather be out with, with her chickens and turkeys (laughter) and, and guineas and all of that sort of thing.  But she was a real leader.  She was president of, of PTA [Parent Teacher Association], superintendent of the Sunday school, president of the, when, when we finally got a home demonstration agent.  Are you familiar with the home demonstration agent and agricultural agent?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They used to, to go to show people how to utilize the, the land that they, that they had (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and the farm, and the farm animals.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and, and the women with home decoration and food preparation and, and preservation, (laughter) you know, the whole, whole bit of homemaking on the farm.  They have, they have some wonderful pictures of mother dear in some of those, doing some of those kinds of things that they, that Texas A&M [Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas], the, the black (laughter) section, everything has to have, has blacks, A&M University supervised (laughter) Prairie View University [Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] for years.  So the black counterpart came from Prairie View and the, (laughter) well.  But at any rate when, when, and I became a, when I left Lockhart [Texas] that job that I took in Terrell [Texas] was home demonstration agent.  The, but every year, you, you, we would make a report, we would have pictures and showing of what we've done.  Well, since they didn't have a home demonstration agent, well, they didn't initially in, in Austin [Texas], a lot of the stuff came, still came from, from the reports were made by the agricultural agent with pictures and claiming credit for whatever they could claim credit (laughter) for.  And so he has these pictures of Ma dear that is exhibited every year at the state capitol [Texas State Capitol, Austin, Texas] (laughter).  The I don't, I don't ever remember seeing any of Pops, you would think you would have Mom and Pops.  The, and my brothers, younger brothers and sisters were part of the 4-H club but when we finally got the, that service available to African Americans in this county, the, do you know about the 4-H Clubs?
Speaker 1: You can tell me.
Story_ID: 620320
Speaker 1: Let's continue to talk about your mom [Cecilia Rucker Collins] first before we go there.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Well, as part of, part of that one of the, one of the other pictures that I have, that I like, is Mother and Pops [Walter Collins] both with the turkeys, you know, (gesture) he loved those turkeys.  And she would--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) he was, here was the way, here, here, here was one of the interesting things about them.  First of all, Pops never disciplined the girls. Ma dear did that.  And the way she disciplined, she said that her mother fussed a lot.  And she swore that she would never be a fusser.  But Ma dear would set us down in front of her just like you are there except closer, and she never spoke louder than I'm speaking right now and she explained to you what was expected of you.  And she, (laughter) with me, I don't know what she said to the rest of 'em but with me she would always say, "Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson], you of all people" (laughter).  That was a, ooh, boy, that's cut right through you.  But she never raised her voice and that was the most effective way of disciplining children you could ever imagine.  And I discovered that I, just automatically without even thinking about it, I disciplined mine the same way.  And then my daughter [Sandra Anderson Baccus] did the same thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where did your mother attend school?
Speaker 2: Ma dear, her, her parents, her parents had, Grandmother Rucker [Ida Perry Rucker] had a sister living in Oklahoma and they talked my grandparents into moving to Oklahoma 'cause it was gonna be all this so wonderful on--and buy a farm.  And they got there just about time for the Dust Bowl, but they were still living in, in Oklahoma when my parents got married so they were married in Oklahoma, March 23, 1913 (laughter).
Speaker 1: So that's where she went to school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What school did she go to?
Speaker 2: One of the stories that she told me that had absolutely no meaning to me at the time, she said that, she said, "You know, those old boys would snort cat- cocaine," and this is in this little rural community.  And she said (makes sound), "They would suck it up their nose," and she said, "and then they would act real crazy." And said, "Those old crazy boys are always the ones like, who liked me."  And it had no meaning to me because when I was in high school [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] there was no drugs, I'd never heard of any.  I just hadn't heard of drugs.  You know, those was later generations when the drug culture came.  And then I said, "Oh, that's what Ma dear was telling me," (laughter).  "That's what it was."  But and (laughter) Ma dear made a, her, she was a beautiful seamstress, I mean exceptional, she could make overcoats with all the inner lining and everything.  She made all my, my brothers' shirts for years, (unclear) they got to be, my dad bought his own.  But she made everything.  She liked to, she had an artisticment but she never had any kind of training so there was a technique where she would buy the pillows, I mean material to make pillow. In, in my mind I can see a black one that she had kind of, it was a black kind of a sateen, and then she stamped a design on it and then you put something like paste or something she had a, something she, that was never my bag so I, you know, and outline it, and then put the colors on it and shake it off, brush it off or whatever and you end up with a parrot and all of the beautiful colors, she'd make 'em for pillows for the sofa.  She quilted, taught me to quilt.  And our family was the African American family in the community. The others were not, they were all white but there was this wonderful relationship between the black and the white families.  And so those women would come over and, you know, how you hang the, the, the quilting, you know, those wooden quilting things you hang it up in the ceiling and she'd put it in her living room and (laughter), and I guess I was, I was there, I was, I was old enough to teach me how and I, I learned how but again it's, I didn't stick with that.  I sew very well but I would make garments (laughter) with the sewing machine.
Story_ID: 620321
Speaker 1: So that we can--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --began to move towards you.
Speaker 2: Can I also tell you that my grandmother, my mom's mother, taught school before she was married, 'cause, you know, you didn't have to have a college degree then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: And she was a, a midwife (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your, your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You're talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mom's mother.
Speaker 1: You're talking about--
Speaker 2: My mom's mother.
Speaker 1: --Ida Rucker [Ida Perry Rucker]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She--
Speaker 1: She was a mid- a midwife?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  She delivered all of us.  She gave me her scissors, she said, "Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson], I want you to have this."  Said, "This is, these are the scissors that cut your umbilical cord." So I have it.
Story_ID: 620322
Speaker 1: I was asking you about your mom's [Cecilia Rucker Collins] formal education.
Speaker 2: Eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Eighth grade.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And she finished eighth grade in Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what about your father [Walter Collins]?
Speaker 2: My dad finished, I think, seventh grade at Pilot Knob [Texas].  You know, it's so interesting now that you look at that level of education, they were both avid readers.  And (laughter) the, our newspaper was delivered by the postman to our, our mailbox that was, I don't know how to describe it, quarter of a mile, eighth of a mile, whatever from our house, and everybody was waiting to get (laughter) that newspaper by noon so when we had the noon meal everybody was trading pages of the newspaper (laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause they only got one, it was just one newspaper?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and, you know, lots of magazines, lots of magazines.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we'll talk more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, you know, and we had books but our, we didn't have enough books, we didn't have a library (laughter) so we never had, you know, in school we had the minimum.
Story_ID: 620323
Speaker 1: Now, tell me more about your father and what did he do?
Speaker 2: He was a farmer with many interests.  Very gregarious.  He was, I would call him an unlicensed veterinarian.  He did all of the vaccinations, tended all the sick animals in the whole community. When I say the whole community outside of our family then there was an all-white community.  And they had, with the farming when it was time to gather the crops, they would come and help with baling the hay and, you know, all of this stuff, they, meaning the, the white neighbors.  And they would send their boys over and our, and our brothers would do it, 'cause we weren't permitted to work on, on the farm either (laughter), he carried on Newton Isaac's [Anderson's paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins], I mean Dee Gabriel's [Anderson's paternal grandfather, Dee Gabriel Collins] principle and I think Newton Isaac's as well.  The, he was a breeder of greyhounds and a breeder of bloodhounds, and he, and also a fine strain of cattle.  He had, my brother tells me, you know, what I knew about the outside was like zero it was all, I, I say I grew up on a farm but it was a hot house plant, hot house plant.  But my brother tells me that that Pops had, I think it's some kind of Lacy [ph.] or something named for the cattle, that he had, he brought over from, from France.  The white, white head heifers I knew, I knew what they were.  And then he had Bremers.  So he was truly, truly an animal lover and so were all my brothers, all of 'em were true animal lovers.  The, as a result of his dogs we had people from all walks of life and all colors, all my life I grew up around.  They were always there, they went hunting with my dad, they were, you know, buying some of the dogs and whatever but it was always filled.  And in the, in the fall of the year when they would slaughter the animals for, you know, a, a beef or a, a hog, the neighbors would all come over and help.  Well, I don't remember anything about helping with the beef, they probably did, but always with the hogs and all those women would come over and they would chop the, the fat and cook it out for the lard and the cracklings, you'd have crackling bread (laughter).  The, and my dad made the best sausage in ten counties. People were always begging him to sell 'em sausage so he'd just make a lot of extra sausage, he would either, and you could either buy it in a, you know, in the, for, for patties or you could buy the links.  And so he made 'em both and you could have 'em smoked or not smoked, the links could be smoked or not smoked.  And people were always lining up (laughter) for 'em. "Please save me," they put their order in a, a year early (laughter).  Ma dear used to keep track of the, the people who had ordered.  And that's the way--and another thing interesting about my, my parents, I've, I've come to realize how unusual it was but I never in my life and I don't think anybody in my family ever heard them argue.  Now, I've heard Ma dear say, "Now Walter [Walter Collins]," and he'd say, "Okay, boss."  My dad was six foot whatever, Ma dear was 5'2", I never, all I used to see them do, my dad would say, he called her boss, "Boss, come here," Ma dear come in thinking he wanted something, and he'd tell my brothers, "Now look, isn't she beautiful?" (Laughter) And then he told all my brothers, he said, "The best gift that you can give your children is to love their mother."  I think that is the neatest thing.
Story_ID: 620324
Speaker 1: I wanna just go back a little bit to talk about the property because--on which you lived--you said that it was all white neighbors. So I'm, I'm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But the--
Speaker 1: --I'm trying to get a, a feel for--
Speaker 2: But let me--go ahead.
Speaker 1: --the property because aren't the other family members living on the property as well?  There's 506 acres that's looking at Pilot Knob [Texas], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.  Where were the rest of the, his brothers, his siblings?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  By the time I came along, all of them had sold either to my [paternal] grandfather [Dee Gabriel Collins], most- mostly to my grandfather, most of it had already been sold to him.  When I described that there was these small pieces that somebody outside of the family owned, well that was kind of all that got away (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But most of it that was sold was sold to my, to my grandfather.  He was the only one who lived long term.  Now, Newton Isaac, Jr. [Newton Collins] lived there for quite a while.  You, you saw those Newton Isaac, Jr. and his whole family, they stayed apparently quite a while, I think maybe most of his children were born there but by the time I came along, they were all gone.  The, and there's one portion of it, of the land that belonged to some cousins but it was still in, within the family.
Story_ID: 620325
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit more now about you, since, you know, you, you've already started talking about you and, and the things that were going on, on the farm.  One of them that you talked about was the slaughtering and, you know, of, of the hogs and the smoking of the sausage.  What else, what other things were going on as you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Besides the Depression [Great Depression] (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Did you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause nobody had any, any discretionary funds, there was no such thing by the time I was old enough to think about what a nickel looks like.
Speaker 1: But did you really feel the effects of the Depression?  I mean, did you really understand what that meant?
Speaker 2: It, everybody was poor so you don't feel left out, I mean, you know.
Speaker 1: But did you know you were poor or did--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --you think you were poor?
Speaker 2: Interesting, no.  Let me tell you.  Let, let me, let me explain that a little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never in my whole life ever heard my parents [Cecilia Rucker Collins and Walter Collins] say we were poor, ever. They never used the word poor which I think was fabulous.  They just said we didn't have any money, (laughter) yeah.  But, and, and I'm not one who, you know, a lot of people say, "We didn't know we were poor 'cause we had plenty to eat," and all that, no.  That was just not a word.  There were two words that were not used in, in our household, one was poor and one was anything about anybody's color. Those were two references that weren't, you'd be in big trouble if you did.  And we just knew not to.  You know, we weren't stupid, we knew there was segregation, we knew we went to all-black schools, we knew all of that.  And we knew our white neighbors went to the all-white schools, you know, we knew all of that.  But that is one of the things that I, that I appreciate and I think all of my siblings, we've never had any thought of being uncomfortable around people of, from any country, anywhere.  And I think, I think that what they did was, you know, was really very helpful.  And also I don't think any of us have ever used the word poor in reference to ourselves.  There's something about using the word that is psychological.  And, you know, nobody said "Why," you know, it just was (laughter).
Speaker 1: But you always had the things that you needed?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You always had enough food to eat--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and clothes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And Ma dear could sew.  I mean, there were, I think about it now how resourceful people were.  And then when I think about the current downturn in the economy, when you have to you can be resourceful, you can figure out how to make whatever you need happen.  And, you know, and going to college [Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] I got scholarships, and college was cheap.  And, you know, I, I was embarrassed then. The--I would take eggs and bacon, (laughter) not bacon, I'm sorry, we ate that at home, (laughter). I'd take eggs and butter to my teachers, and that was embarrassing to me.  I mean, I was just a kid (laughter).
Speaker 1: You would take (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not in high school [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas], not in high school but, but in college.
Speaker 1: You would take that to them?  Why was it embarrassing to take that to them?
Speaker 2: Have you ever been twelve years old?
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.  Why did things embarrass you, (laughter) you know.
Speaker 1: But why were you taking them the butter and the, the eggs?
Speaker 2: To, to collect the money. That was income.
Story_ID: 620326
Speaker 1: And that's something else that that I realize now was kind of different about my parents' relationship.  Pops [Walter Collins] took the, used the money, you know, from the farm, from farming to run the farm and, you know, all, everything outdoors. The cattle, everything, he'd sell cattle that was another source of money of, you know, actual, real money.  But the eggs and butter and chicken and turkeys that was Ma dear's [Cecilia Rucker Collins] money and she always had her own bank account with the sole signature of herself, and, you know, that sense of independence.  And I don't ever remember hearing it discussed, that's just the way it was.  And the, at, at Christmas and, and Thanksgiving was the time that Ma dear would, would sell the turkeys and she would, I don't know if Ma dear killed 'em. I guess Pops killed 'em for her, I don't remember, and she would dress them.  I even remember helping her pull off the, the, the feathers and everything.  And she would just, they would just look so pretty and you could order any size you wanted.  And people would come and I mean she would sell out (laughter) both times and that was her money.  And that, you know, that was a, quite a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Do you remember what she sold them for (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I mean, you know, in that, for that timeframe. But now Ma dear always spent the money, you know, you go back, you know, mothers, are gonna spend it on the family (laughter) or something for the family.  But, and (laughter) let me tell you something that I thought was so funny.  I never noticed it when I was growing up but (laughter) as an, as an adult and, you know, they had, Pops paid all the bills, (laughter) and I'd go out and pick Ma dear up. She loved to ride with me but at the time we started the real estate business [Anderson Wormley Real Estate and Insurance Company, Austin, Texas] she loved to, to ride with me and look at the houses and I'd take her to a lot of new subdivisions and so on.  So (laughter) we'd spend the whole afternoon and on the way home we'd pick up say a loaf of bread and by this time he wasn't doing any milking and 'cause everybody's gone from home and we'd pick up bread, milk, you know, anything that Ma dear thought about.  And when we'd come home (laughter) wherever Pops was she would hand him the bill and he would go in his pocket and give, refund her money.  And if it was two cents and one of those coins was a nickel, she gave him back the three cents.  It was the funniest thing.  I didn't remember seeing that when I was growing up but (laughter) as an adult.  I thought that was the funniest thing.  The (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ma dear was the one who taught my son [Marcellus J. Anderson, Jr.] to make cakes and he was (laughter)--
Story_ID: 620327
Speaker 1: We need to talk a little bit more about you and your growing up.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, if I were to ask you about a sound, a sight, or a smell that would take you back to that time, what would you say?
Speaker 2: A sound or a sight?
Speaker 1: Or a smell?  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) (gesture).
Speaker 1: No sounds remind you of--
Speaker 2: The only, (laughter) oh, I can think of one thing which was, wasn't, I don't know if it fits the category but the--my dad [Walter Collins] bought the first car when I was born and he gave it to my mother [Cecilia Rucker Collins] so he said, gave her the key.  Ma dear never learned to drive (laughter) in her whole life but it was hers.  He also bought her a sewing machine so both of those things supposedly was because they finally had a girl.  So but when we would, when it would rain we had, we called it the lane and so from, from the county road that was graveled, that's the one that's now named for Dee Gabriel [Anderson's paternal grandfather, Dee Gabriel Collins], but from that county road down to our house, was no gravel it was just mud and the car would (makes sound) would scare me to death. "Please let me out and, and walk, I can walk."  And, of course, they (laughter) ignored me. "Please, please, please let me walk," because that scared me to death.
Story_ID: 620328
Speaker 1: The other thing is I was never permitted to ride a horse.  I didn't, I was a girl, I was not a boy, couldn't wear pants, couldn't do any of those boy, boy things.  And I didn't mind too much riding in a wagon where they've got two mules pulling it but I sure was not comfortable. I did not like riding behind a live animal (laughter).  And (laughter) once one of my brothers put me on the horse to ride with him, and--one time--and when I, we arrived home my parents had just driven up in the car and that was the one time my dad [Walter Collins] got a little switch about (gesture) that big, that's the only time 'cause he never as I said disciplined the girls, and I guess made me get the point that I wasn't supposed to do that 'cause that was what boys did.  I would, and when I tell you I was, I was brought up as a hot house plant on the farm, I know, I don't know as much--(laughter) my da- my husband [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] had a, had an expression, I didn't know much as Skippy (laughter) about the real, the real farm.  I knew more about grandfather's (laughter) than I did mine.  I'll tell you one other story about growing up and I was just telling my cousins that, this past weekend.  I learned to cook, I learned to do all of those things really, really early, the sister [Pearl Collins Norris] next to me is four years younger.  And I guess, you know, I just thought I was as big as Ma dear [Cecilia Rucker Collins] and I could do anything that she could do.  And the, I learned to stand on a box and make biscuits and I could, I'd stand on a box and try to iron a shirt (laughter) 'cause my oldest brother [Walter Collins] liked to cook so when he finished his chores 'cause they'd start really, really early, when he finished his chores outside, he would come in and I'd make the biscuits, and I mean, I'm on a box (laughter) and he would, he would cook the bacon and the eggs and the whatever else.  And he would, you know, I didn't touch the, work on the stove, he would put the biscuits in the stove and he'd take 'em, he'd watch 'em and take 'em out.  That's just because he liked to cook.  Well, my uncle who was living then at the home place 'cause my [paternal] grandfather [Dee Gabriel Collins] had died and my uncle got married, moved in the house with grandmother [Donnie Sauls Collins].  And his wife [Henrietta Collins (ph.)] was trying to be very, very nice when my younger brother [Joe Collins] who was seven years younger than me, seven, and she was coming to, up to, when, when he was born she was gonna come up and cook for the family, my uncle's bride (laughter).  I was so incensed, I was so mad, I didn't need her to come up there and cook, I could cook.  And I was furious (laughter).  I was telling her children about that (laughter) this, this weekend.  "I was so mad at your mother" (laughter).

Speaker 1: Now, since there was no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And also I remembered at that time too, they'd had a flood, I mean, a real flood.  It was, that Cotton- that Cottonmouth Creek, the little creek I told you that ran near my [paternal] grandfather's [Dee Gabriel Collins] house.  It was up and almost to the house and the animals had been over there grazing and the cattle were stuck in the mud and they had to go down and try to get those cows out 'cause they would die.  And I remember watching all of that.  And then aunt, (laughter) Aunt Henrietta [Anderson's paternal aunt, Henrietta Collins (ph.)] wanted to come up here and cook (laughter).  That's just one of the little silly incidents.
Story_ID: 620330
Speaker 1: And my dad [Walter Collins] would come and get me when I went to high school [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas], he would come on the weekends and pick me up.  And you asked me why would I be embarrassed, and he had on his overalls well, you know, I was in the city and (laughter) by this time I was twelve and I'd eventually got to, I mean, not too long, I turned thirteen but no, that's not right, I was eleven and I turned twelve (laughter) when I went to high school.  'Cause I had gone to school in the country and I had gone, you know, long before I was old enough and that was when I told you about talking about my name.  And I was sitting on the front row with the first grade, I sat myself down and they were learning how to spell their first name and I started crying (makes sounds) my brother, "Shh," (makes sounds), "I don't have anything to learn.  Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson] is spelled the same way backwards and forwards, A-D-A, backwards and forwards, I don't have" (makes sound) (laughter).  "Shh" (makes sounds) (laughter).  I think I was three (laughter).  I had no business there but I stayed, I wouldn't let 'em stop me.
Story_ID: 620331
Speaker 1: And, you know, one of the other really pleasant memories from, from that time period, my brother [Edgar Collins] who was just older than me, (laughter) you know, the girls were so fast, and (laughter) Ma dear [Cecilia Rucker Collins] said I was always buttering him up (laughter) and he was four years, three years older than me.  And he, he and I would come home from school together, my, my big brothers would go on home.  And the, the way the terrain of the, of the property, where the road runs was flat but the, somebody at some point in time had built a rock fence because the, it kind of took us, kind of a, not too sharp but it went down like this and it was real rocky so they didn't actually farm all the way up to this fence.  So my brother and I would, would walk underneath that, we'd take two hours to get home.  We would throw little pebbles at the birds and the butterflies (laughter) and we both ended up with really the same temperament, you know, laid back, love, love birds and butterflies (laughter) are still my favorite, favorite things, are butterflies and birds.  "Look for the red bird." "Oh, there's a red bird." "A woodpecker, oh, there's a woodpecker."  We could identify a few of the birds.  Not too many 'cause nobody taught us how to identify and name all those others.  We knew a dove, we knew a quail, and they would (makes sounds) throw up their--and, you know.  What do you call 'em a, a covey? Whatever the term is they use, you know, they would all be together.  Yeah, (makes sound) oh, really.  We didn't have any (unclear).  And then we'd lie on our back (laughter) and look, see what the, what the, what kind of--
Speaker 2: Can you--
Speaker 1: --shapes that the, that the clouds took.
Story_ID: 620332
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what holidays were like at your house?
Speaker 2: Ma dear [Cecilia Rucker Collins] always cooked a big dinner and generally we had chicken and dressing or turkey and dressing, and sweet potatoes and what all we had?  We had a lot of stuff.  We had a garden so we had greens, whatever was in season.  And she would, you know, she canned, they would, all the women did on the farm then.  You had enough food 'cause you grew it and then you preserved it.  And with, with the, with the beef, my dad [Walter Collins] would slaughter it and take, I think he took it as a half, you know, just split it down the middle and brought it to, what do they call it?  It's, I think it's actually, was actually called a slaughterhouse but he would bring it all ready and they would cut it up and package it in the size we wanted and then and label it and put it in the freezer.  So we would come, my dad would come and pick it up, you know, for the, for the, a couple of times or so a week.  And he, and incidentally another thing about my parents, my dad liked to shop for groceries.  When my dad died (laughter) my mama didn't even wanna know how to shop for groceries (laughter) but he did all the grocery shopping.
Story_ID: 620333
Speaker 1: As a student what (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let, let me tell you one other thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was talking about the car (laughter) that he [Anderson's father, Walter Collins] gave her [Anderson's mother, Cecilia Rucker Collins].  My grandfather Dee Gabriel [Dee Gabriel Collins], bought a car even before my dad and he, my brothers tell me, 'cause I didn't remember talking about it then, that he would actually have the third car that was owned in Travis County [Texas].  I told you he was very progressive.
Story_ID: 620334
Speaker 1: Farming was, when, you know, before I would, you know, before the Depression [Great Depression], farming was, was lucrative, you know, wasn't nothing lucrative (laughter) as I understand during the Depression.  Men came and, and worked by the day and I remember when my dad [Walter Collins] raised their wages to a dollar a day, raised it to a dollar a day.  I think it, I hate to say I think it was seventy-five cents but I remember specifically, and even then a lot of times Ma dear [Cecilia Rucker Collins] would cook up a big pot of beans and greens and whatever and give 'em lunch.
Speaker 2: How many workers were there on the farm?
Speaker 1: Oh, I have no idea.  And it varied depending on where the crops were and, I mean, I don't know.  Told you I don't know anything about what happened outside of the kitchen (laughter).
Story_ID: 620335
Speaker 1: We're talking about your aunts and you were gonna tell me about your aunts and their pro- professions.
Speaker 2: The--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Hang on one second.
Speaker 2: These were my mom's aunts.
Speaker 1: Wait, wait hold up a minute.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I'm sorry a couple of strands (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I thought, I thought you were gonna take picture, Scott [Scott Stearns] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Okay.  Go ahead.  We're still (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: My mom's sister, Musidora [Musidora Rucker Grant] (laughter) taught in the rural areas.  She graduated from Tillotson College [Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] as I did. And then, and then Aunt Pearl [Pearl Rucker] who was next to her had a floral company in Houston [Texas] and she, that was the first florist that was established by an African American.  And she, she was, she went to New York [New York] and learned some of the basics and she didn't know anybody who was a florist, (cough) excuse me, and then came back and started hers.  And it was interesting the way she started it with doing funerals and weddings.  And then later they, she got married and they had their own greenhouse and grew their own plants.  And, of course, they still had to buy some of the, the flowers, very successful business.  And my next aunt, Aunt Annie [Annie Rucker Baker], lived in Littig [Texas] which is in the suburb of Austin [Texas]. It's in, still in, in this same county.  And her husband, husband's family owned a lot of land there.  And he grew up just being a cowboy, (laughter) he always had on his cowboy boots and his Stetson hat.  And he organized the first rodeo in this area and it was on his own property.  And they would sell tickets and, you know, they, they charged for people to come in and it was very interesting.
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: Garland Baker.  And he was one of two sons so they had, as I said they had quite a large, large farming, farm.  And Aunt Elmira [Elmira Rucker] was, she decorated the windows for retail.  The, and she did that in Austin for a long time and then they, they moved to Los Angeles [California] and she did, that was her whole career, loved doing it (laughter).  And then the youngest was Kisiah [Kisiah Rucker] and she was a teacher.
Story_ID: 620336
Speaker 1: And you also wanted to show us the volcanic rock from--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Pilot Knob.
Speaker 2: Now, the, and going back to the Collins family, my dad's [Walter Collins] family, 'cause that was the Ruckers we were talking about but my dad's family, when they moved to, moved from, from Austin [Texas], actually the Austin area, they moved to Pilot Knob [Texas].  And the extinct volcano, I have a rock, you wanna--
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: --see this rock?  This is one of the volcanic rocks, it's a small one and it's just like iron, (laughter) very heavy.  And most of them are just huge boulders. This just is one of the smaller ones.  The, the, there was also, I described along Cottonmouth Creek, a small creek that ran near my [paternal] grandparents' home, the, they had an artesian well on grandfather's property.  And what he did was to take a barrel, a wooden barrel, and took the bottom out and left a few pieces, cross pieces like this so there was something to stand on and he placed it over the well.  And it was, the artesian water had lots of sulfur and a lot of healing properties and the water was real, real warm, wonderful place to just stand in it and it was very relaxing and if, if you had abrasions, you know, how kids skin their, skin their knees and so on, it would cure it very quickly.  The, there were all, people from all--the water by the way, the water was just like the, the Hot Springs, Arkansas, and people would line up, there were cars lined up when I was, long as I could remember for miles to come and, and get gallons of water, they'd fill up a lot of gallon jugs to drink 'cause it was supposedly healthy and also help their arthritis and whatever.  I don't, I was never aware that my grandfather [Dee Gabriel Collins] sold it, as far as I know it was, he just allowed people to, to come and use it at will.  That's one of the real highlights.  Back to, to the actual land itself.  I have the original papers that was filed by a Mexican from Mexico (laughter) for the property, his name was Senor Del Valle [Santiago Del Valle] and I have that petition and, and, and, and the original Mexican and then I have the translation.  And I have the map in color and it covers a huge area.  It, it covers the current air, Austin airport that's part, a part of it.  There's a whole community called Del Valle [Texas], we don't say (pronunciation) Del Valle, (laughter) we say Del Valle.  But it also included all the property that the 506 acres that that my grandfather [sic. paternal great-grandfather, Newton Isaac Collins] purchased and also included that that additional acres that other family members have, have purchased adjoining the, the Collins property.  The, it has a won- just really a rather exciting (laughter) history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  About the, the smell of the water, when you talk about sulfur that has a very strong smell (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It does.  And we lived just north of it.  And when there was, the, you know, the temperature, when there, all the conditions were right, we could smell it at our house.  But and that was a big deal, you know, has the same, (laughter) the same odor as, as rotten eggs (laughter) if you've ever smelled a rotten egg.  But it, I mean, people really said that it was, it was, had all kinds of health properties.
Speaker 1: Is, has the, the well dried up or is that still available (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, what has happened now, one, one of my brothers, I only had one brother (laughter) out of the nine children in my family only one stayed on the farm.  And he expanded it and made a, a, what do we call it?  Anyway, it's, it's a big pond for his animals so the well, you can't use the well anymore.  And that that well was what kept the, the Cottonmouth Creek, the small creek running, so now it just trickles and it's mostly a, a wet weather creek, it just kind of trickles.
Story_ID: 620337
Speaker 1: Let's move on to, at this point, we are at the place where you're going to high school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you're only eleven years old but tell me about going to high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was exciting.  I had to stay with, stay with various aunts (laughter).  The, the last aunt that was Aunt Musidora [Anderson's maternal aunt, Musidora Rucker Grant] that I told you taught school.  I stayed with my Aunt Lizzy [Elizabeth Collins Turner], and I stayed with my Aunt Elmira [Elmira Rucker], (laughter) I stayed, so I was very close to my mom's [Cecilia Rucker Collins] sisters.  They always said that I was more like a sister even though I was a gazillion years younger.  The--and I, you know, walked to school but I was so excited and delighted and made friends quickly and I don't ever remember being, having any adjustment problems.  I just was always a rather happy, (laughter) happy young person.  And math and science were my favorite subjects.  The, and so we organized a math club and there were all boys and me (laughter).  I think there were four boys and me.  And we would come to school at 7:00, 7:30 in the morning and tutor (laughter).  We started doing that in the eighth, in the eighth grade 'cause that's what it was then. It was the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: What, what school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Anderson High [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The old Anderson High.  The one that burned.
Speaker 1: So it was L.C. Anderson?
Speaker 2: Right.  And Mrs., Mayte, Mayte Lewis [ph.] was my, she taught Spanish and, you know, I really, we, I had some really great teachers.  The, and we were fortunate because so many of our teachers went, had additional training, they had master's degrees and so on from colleges and universities outside of Texas and that gave us that, you know, extra.  And the classes were small.  The, Mrs. Durton [ph.] was my favorite person (laughter) and she taught clothing and I adored her.  In fact, I always, she was like a mentor to me.  The, and that was all, not only all through school but all through my life, all through her life and just a wonderful person.  In fact, she, (laughter) I discovered this not too long ago in a, in a drawer here 'cause I had long since forgotten it, she was the one who was instrumental in giving me the personality certificate when I graduated (laughter).
Speaker 1: The personality certificate?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Tell me what that is.
Speaker 2: Well, it was a certificate saying that I had, I can't think of the right word to describe it but let's just say that I, (laughter) I was--
Speaker 1: The most popular and you had the best personality?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know about my personality. I was just always such a happy person and I suppose that's what it was reflecting.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And, and I liked all my classmates and I had a lot of, you know, close friends.  One of the interesting things is that the girls in high school are dating, well, I was too young to be (laughter) interested in dating, so on weekends when they would go on their dates, couldn't wait to get back to school on Monday and they would always tell me everything they did, well, I don't know if they told me everything but I thought they did (laughter) anyway.  So I had this vicarious experience (laughter).  And it, it was interesting too when I look back because that same thing happened when I was at Pilot Knob School [Pilot Knob, Texas], there were older girls (laughter) and they would lift me up and put 'em up, put me on their shoulder, I'd get so mad.  And but they would always tell me about all of their boyfriends and everything they had done on weekends and I'm just listening and, you know, thought that was, I thought that was appropriate.  I don't think my mother ever knew that. I don't think my parents [Cecilia Rucker Collins and Walter Collins] ever knew that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it seemed real normal to me.
Story_ID: 620338
Speaker 1: Were there any other extracurricular activities outside of school [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas]?  Did you go to the Y [Young Women's Christian Association]?  Did you learn to swim?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I went home on weekends and, (laughter) and helped with my younger sisters and brothers.
Speaker 1: Did you take music or were you in any sports?
Speaker 2: The sports is the last thing, (laughter) absolutely the last thing I was interested in.  I played basketball one day and said, "Please don't put me out here anymore."  The, I just didn't, it didn't appeal to me.  The, I didn't even like PE [physical education] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I guess I was more of a, you know, I, I guess I read more and, you know, did more of those serious kinds of things.
Story_ID: 620339
Speaker 1: The only teacher that I didn't think was the best in the school [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] was my, my English teacher and we had only two there.  And I, I drew the short, short straw, I guess (laughter).  But it was just a very happy experience.  I liked the, the, I liked all the teachers.  But Miss Durton [ph.], I, I think was my favorite.  Mrs. Catherine Fisher [ph.] taught foods and that was kind of secondary in my life.  But I did like her, she was very nice.  I remember one thing, I don't know if I should tell this or not but it seemed so natural to me. I had had a vaccination and the (unclear) were sore under my arm and I went to Miss Fisher and I said, "Feel this, this is sore," (laughter) and she was feeling under my arm (laughter).  She thought it was funny.  I thought it just seemed perfectly normal, my mom [Cecilia Rucker Collins] wasn't there (laughter).  That's one of those things I never forgot 'cause I, I don't know that really was, (laughter) it was not exactly (laughter) an appropriate thing to do but that's how relaxed I was.  "Tell me what's going on."  So she told me it was the vaccination (laughter) that had created--
Story_ID: 620340
Speaker 1: So you graduate, you're only sixteen when you graduate [from L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] or are you seventeen?
Speaker 2: Fifteen.
Speaker 1: Fifteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And had you thought about college or--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was, it was a gone--foregone conclusion that I was going to college.  And I also stayed with my aunt, mostly my Aunt Musidora [Anderson's maternal aunt, Musidora Rucker Grant] for college and I was really close to college to walk to, to, to school.  The, one of the little stories, the, when I was a freshman they had, you know, during the initial, initiation (laughter) of the freshmen class, I was sitting in front of, two of the guys who were juniors and, you know, how they check out and flirt with the, with the, with the new girls.  And (laughter) so they asked me how old I was and by this time I was fifteen, and I proudly said, "Fifteen," and I thought they would never stop laughing.  One of them had a speech impediment and he said, "Fisteen" (laughter) and that was my nickname throughout college was Fisteen.  Many, many years later I was in New York [New York] walking down Broadway and was actually walk, was at Times Square, and I heard somebody behind me saying, "Fisteen," (laughter) this was many years later, "Fisteen," and I turned around and there was this guy that I had been in college with.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's amazing for him to remember you.
Speaker 2: From and I was, I was walking, he was behind me (laughter).  One of my sisters was with me.
Speaker 1: So actually you graduated in 1932 from high school, would that be right?
Speaker 2: Thirty--let me think.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Let me see I graduated from college in '41 [1941].
Speaker 1: So 1937, I'm sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: Thirty-seven [1937].
Speaker 1: Thirty-seven [1937].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you went to which college?
Speaker 2: Tillotson College [Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] which is an all-black congregation.  We said about the congregation, what, what do you call their, their hierarchy, the Congregational church?  Anyway, that was who originally, you know, most of the black colleges [HBCUs] were set up, were organized and supported by some of the churches.  Samuel Huston [Samuel Huston College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] was for example, the other black college was supported by the Methodist church.
Speaker 1: So what, tell me more about your, your college years.  'Cause you told me about your freshmen year.  But what courses were you taking and--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --tell me about some of the instructors (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was gonna tell you about the fun stuff.  The, (laughter) oh, yeah, Mrs. Lewis, Lillian Lewis [Lillian Burwell Lewis] organized the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and so I was one of the charter members there.  And that was a very, very good experience in teaching you leadership and abilities and, you know, be comfortable presiding and so on.  The, the Samuel Huston already had a chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha and so we did a lot of things together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was another, another organization on campus, called Delvers Club [Delvers Dramatic Club] which was just a club, it had no connection with any other work, any other school, it was not a national organization but it was set up almost like a sorority as well and we studied dramatics and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you graduated with a degree in what?
Speaker 2: In home economics.  And the reason I (laughter) had home economics was because it was easier first of all to get a job, and secondarily it paid more so that was family influence.  I really was looking at math and science and then I had learned to really enjoy Spanish and my Spanish teacher wanted me to, to major in Spanish.  And my problem was I liked everything, (laughter) everything except PE [physical education] and music (laughter).  No talent (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were, were there any art classes?  You, you alluded to the fact that very young you began to appreciate art.
Speaker 2: I'm--I still appreciate it.  I, (laughter) I don't make it (laughter).
Story_ID: 620341
Speaker 1: What happens after graduation, this is in 1941 when you graduate?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I went to, I got my first teaching job at Lockhart [Texas] which was a small community just south of, of Austin [Texas].  And taught there for eight months and the ninth month I was offered a job in Terrell, Texas, which is in north Texas near Dallas [Texas] and I was a home demonstration agent.  They, in Lockhart, I taught math, and science, English, and sponsored the, the dramatics club, that's the, participated in, my kids participated in the competition, you know, with the other schools.  I can't think of what you call it, the--and then I taught, but I did that for half day and the other half day I taught home economics to, to high school students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think when we were talking earlier I told you that it, I learned only in recent years that I was teaching in what was known as a Rosenwald school [Lockhart Vocational High School, Lockhart, Texas].  And I think we talked, talked about what a Rosenwald school was.
Speaker 1: Yes.  So now tell me more about the home demonstration aide--
Speaker 2: Agent (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) job, agent.
Speaker 2: That was to teach homemaking practices and so on with the, with the women.  But Terrell was in Kaufman County [Texas] and the, they had no agricultural agent which, to work with the men, so I worked with both of 'em, I could read (laughter) and I could share pamphlets with them and share a lot of things.  So I, I really functioned in, in the, in both capacities.  And, and I, I was there a couple of years and then I got married [to Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson].
Story_ID: 620342
Speaker 1: How did you meet your husband?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: His legal name is Marcellus Jack Anderson [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] (laughter) and he was known as Andy, Andy Anderson.  He was teaching school at Samuel Huston [Samuel Huston College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] when I graduated from Tillotson [Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas].  And he has a story, he had a story that he would tell but I'm not gonna try to tell you the story (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so how long did you, how, how long did you date before you got married?
Speaker 2: About a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so when, what is your wedding date?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You don't really wanna hear that whole story (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You do?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: For real?  (Laughter) The--he was, by this time he had been drafted into the [U.S.] military, he was in the Medical Corps [U.S. Army Medical Corps] and stationed in New Jersey.  And so I didn't, I'm one of the few human beings, I mean, women that I know who never wanted a wedding, absolutely did not want a formal wedding.  The only other person I know is my daughter [Sandra Anderson Baccus] (laughter).  And so I went to New Jersey and we got married. Well I was still working for the, I was still a home demonstration agent. I hadn't resigned, I had gotten a, gotten a leave and my supervisor came and helped me get my wardrobe together, she was so excited, I told her I was going up there to get married, she said, "Oh," you know, "great."  (Laughter) And I filled out all the forms and everything, the request to leave and then I took off.  When I got back two weeks later they had denied my leave (laughter) for something I didn't fill out right, something I didn't sign or something, it was something wrong with my request.  Well, by that time, since I had been gone for two weeks, I couldn't really afford to tell them, "I'm, I've already, I've been, I've been there and back."  So I just, my supervisor said, "Just apply for another one" (laughter) so I did.  Well, what date did you get married, that's a little tricky (laughter).  So you kind of make up a date (laughter).  And then later, of course, we corrected it.  It was August 14th was the real date which was funny in itself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: You wanna hear about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) give me--
Speaker 2: --you wanna hear about getting married?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know if you wanna hear about, about this getting married.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You got--
Speaker 1: Do you wanna tell the story?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll tell it.  The--I'll tell it now.  The, (laughter) we, we went to the, went to the courthouse and it was on a Saturday and they closed at noon so (laughter) we had to run to get there.  We were stopping with a friend of mine who, who had formally taught at, at Tillotson and she and I were real good friends and my husband also knew her, and her name Bea Shuck [ph.] and she was from Minneapolis [Minnesota], from St. Paul [Minnesota] but she was in Richmond, Virginia, then that's where Andy was, was stationed.  And so she had breakfast for us and so on.  But when we ran (laughter) to, to get married, we didn't even have a ring (laughter).  It was so silly, it was the most fun. (Laughter) Anyway we didn't have to, we were gone take a train out and we didn't have the time to go back to Bea, Bea's to, to eat (laughter) so we got sandwiches (laughter) out of--isn't that silly?  Out of the vending machine (laughter) and we caught this plan- train, and we went to, went to Washington, D.C.  Had hotel reservations and it turned out that this was during these years of segregation but it turned out that this was one of those places where you could hear people walking past your door every hour, you know, one of those, (laughter) one of those, (laughter) kind of hard to sleep.  Oh, anyway it was real fun.  I never told my parents [Cecilia Rucker Collins and Walter Collins] how crazy it was (laughter).  They would have not been happy.
Speaker 1: And so what year was this?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Nineteen forty-three [1943].
Speaker 1: Forty-three [1943].
Story_ID: 620343
Speaker 1: We didn't stay there but one night by the way (laughter).  We moved on (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was another (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let me ask you about the, the pay for a home demonstration agent.  How much did you make?
Speaker 1: A hundred and twenty-five dollars a month.
Speaker 2: A month?
Speaker 1: See I had been making sixty-five dollars in, in, in, in Lockhart [Texas].
Speaker 2: As a teacher?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: And I had to, I had to buy a car and I had never tried to drive, I didn't know, I didn't have any, I didn't know anything about driving.  So my dad [Walter Collins] got the, the day that I was leaving, I was leaving at twelve o'clock at night because it was hot.  And so he finally got the, by the time the bank closed he had gotten the car and gotten it financed and I'd signed all the papers and stuff.  And that was one thing that my dad taught us that, what he would tell us was that you should always get to know the president of your bank.  And so he told, this was actually a vice president he introduced me to, and he said, "Now, this is my daughter.  I'm signing for, for this car but she's gonna pay for it and I want her to, to able to sign for her own credit from now on."  And this was a time when, oh, it was years after that before women could sign without a man's signature.  And I don't know if you're familiar with, with that that period which lasted a very long time in Texas. I don't know about in other places.  The, and the excuse in Texas was that--well, here's the way it worked in Texas, this is even years later when I was married.  And we had moved back to Austin [Texas] and we had, had bought a house and we were paying it off early and so I kept the records and when we went in to pay it off early the president, this was a savings and loan, Austin savings and loan [Mutual Savings Institution, Austin, Texas], and the, we dealt with the president and he was just, you know, nice guy, I liked, we liked him.  And so I had calculated what the balance was.  So when he came out, he came with a different balance.  And I said, "No," and I went through my figures to show him.  And I didn't look up to see that he was getting madder by the minute, my husband [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] just was (laughter) sitting there being quiet.  And he thought he'd just watch this, this play out.  And so he got up and came back and threw the papers down on the table and he said, "Well, since," I'm trying to think of how exactly he said it, "since you wanna be so particular or something there's a penalty for paying it off early."  When we got, when we got out, back to the car, my husband said, "Don't you know that white man," (laughter), "couldn't stand this black woman challenging him?"  The excuse in Texas and I don't know if you're aware that the, was that--and the man had to, had to leave after he signed the papers, he had to leave the room while the wife signed it and the reason for that is that in the pioneer days when the husband would gamble the, the homestead off and so to protect the little lady (laughter) and kiddos (laughter) he would have to leave the room and then he would ask you if you were signing of your own free will and that you are absolutely certain that you've not, there's been no coercion.  And, you know, all of those detailed questions that they would ask.  And so you have to swear that that is the case.
Story_ID: 620344
Speaker 1: So you established your own credit line really as a teenager almost?  Because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you, you were only twenty-two when you got married.
Speaker 2: Twenty-one.
Speaker 1: Twenty-one.
Speaker 2: I married in August and then my birthday was in October so it was close, it was close.  Yes.  And then the other thing my husband [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] was really a very forward thinking person, he had great respect for women, and the, he also insisted that I have credit in my own name.  And the first thing that I bought, first investment I bought was second mortgages. The, and you, you would, the, the going rate was that you gave 'em 50, 50 percent of the value of the, of the balance.  And I bought four.  And that was the beginning of, of my, my credit when I came back to Austin [Texas] to live.  And, and, of course, I've always had my separate credit.  And, and, you know, my mom [Cecilia Rucker Collins] had hers.  You know, I think I told you that story that she had her own money.
Speaker 1: Yes.  She had her own bank account.
Speaker 2: Her own bank account for her own signature and, and so, you know, that was a long time ago.  And we had the same banker that, that I established mine in, it was the same, same bank.  It was one, we only had three large banks here and that was it when I was growing up.  And this was Austin National Bank [Austin, Texas] that, where I established credit.
Story_ID: 620345
Speaker 1: So after you get married and you come back home, what happens next?  Do you continue to work (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my daughter was, was born in, in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: When did you go to Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let me, let me go back to then.  When I got married he [Anderson's husband, Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] was stationed in Princeton, New Jersey, and so I stayed in Princeton, the, until he got ready to go overseas, he went to Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan], and left on Father's Day and I was expecting by then.  He had a brother in Philadelphia and a sister-in-law that I, I liked a lot and I decided, I just felt really independent and so do it on my own (laughter).  And so she was born there.  And she was about three months old when we came back to, when he was discharged from service and then we came back to Texas.  He loved Texas.  He'd grown up in Ohio and he loved Texas.
Speaker 1: And what was your first daughter's name?
Speaker 2: My one and only daughter is Sandra (laughter), Sandra Baccus [Sandra Anderson Baccus], now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: So she was born in 1943 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Forty-three [1943].  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, so, okay.  So it was the same--
Speaker 2: We came back to Austin [Texas] and then our son was born in 1945 and he was born here in Austin.
Speaker 1: What was your son's name?  What is his name?
Speaker 2: Named after his dad (laughter).  We called him Jack [Marcellus J. Anderson, Jr.] (laughter).
Story_ID: 620346
Speaker 1: All right.  So tell me what happens when y'all move back to Austin [Texas]?  Your move to Texas after your husband [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] is now out of the [U.S. military] service (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, he, he went back teaching school.  And--
Speaker 1: Where did he teach school?
Speaker 2: Samuel Huston [Samuel Huston College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was there when Jackie Robinson taught there.
Speaker 1: Jackie Robinson taught school there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, at Samuel Huston, uh-huh.  The, and we lived, you know, kind of close to the college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, by the time my kids [Sandra Anderson Baccus and Marcellus J. Anderson, Jr.] were four and six years old, I went back to the university and took classes part time to get my master's [degree], the University of Texas at Austin [Austin, Texas].  The, at that time they had what they called funds, I was trying to get the right name, funds for out of, out of state funds for Negro students.  And that was, 'cause there was no school in Texas where African Americans could get an advanced degree.  So the university or the state, state funds for Negro, I don't remember exactly how it's, how it's worded but that they provided money for you, as long as you got out of state, you could go anywhere.  And most of my classmates took advantage of that.  One of my classmates who later became president of the combined institution, he and his wife both went to University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] but I'm trying to think of the exact name of it but you could go anywhere.  A lot of my teachers went to Iowa and a number of different schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So at the, the university you were taking classes towards your, your master's?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And my husband had attended Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and he got both his undergraduate and graduate degrees at Ohio State.
Story_ID: 620347
Speaker 1: So what happened with the master's program there [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: The what?
Speaker 1: The master's program, did you finish there?
Speaker 2: What kind of program?
Speaker 1: You were taking master's classes. Graduate classes.
Speaker 2: Oh, graduate classes.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Work- working on my master's [degree].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: When the--Heman Marion Sweatt was the person who filed the, who was the plaintiff when Thurgood Marshall and his group filed a case against the University of Texas to admit him to the law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas].  And the, he won that case [Sweatt v. Painter, 1950], Thurgood Marshall won that case and so in 1950, the fall of 1950 he was admitted.  They didn't open the entire university at that time.  I went to register immediately after he did (laughter), soon as it was open.  And I had, was given a choice between law, architecture, social work, or library science.  So I took, I didn't, really didn't want any of them.  But I took, I wanted to go to school and it was a good time to go and 'cause my kids [Sandra Anderson Baccus and Marcellus J. Anderson, Jr.] were in nursery school, you know, and kindergarten.  And so I took library science.  Wonderful experience.  Sweatt did not have a wonderful experience, he had a horrible experience, terrible. They put him behind a curtain and all kinds of horrible things happened to him.
Speaker 1: Put him behind the curtain, now, tell me some of the things that you're talking about.  What is, what--
Speaker 2: Well, in the classroom they, they put a curtain up between him and the student, other students.  They did all kinds of crazy stuff to him.  It was awful.  He never did get his law degree.  But they, but the university opened, began to open.  And the, the, the deal was when I applied that if, if it were not offered at Prairie View [Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], it could be made available to African Americans at the U- University of Texas at Austin.  If it were offered at Prairie View then you couldn't take it there, you'd have to go to Prairie View.  Segregation was quite something.  The, but at any rate I completed all the coursework, took additional coursework in library science, and the final thing that I needed to get my degree was to do field work.  And the only place that they would send me for field work was to Houston [Texas].  Well, I had two small children, I couldn't go, it wasn't a practical thing for me to do.  So I never actually got the degree.  But later I went back and got a master's in, when everything was opened or almost opened (laughter) it wasn't all open, a master's in ed psych, educational psychology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Before we go, because I wanna ask you about that.  Now, the field classes and, and the library experience also, were you not allowed to go into the libraries before the (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, I, yeah, I was allowed to go there, (laughter) to go everywhere that, you know, my classes.  The, (laughter) you know, segregation, I kept repeating segregation is really quite something. You're denied so much, so many experiences.  And I'm gonna tell you some- something that really is embarrassing.  I finally lived long enough to be able to tell it (laughter) now it was so embarrassing then.  But the library school was separate, in fact, my classroom were, in what is now the president's office, it's in the big tower, you know, the university tower, we were, I guess about the fifth floor or so in the tower.  And the first time that I, I went in the little library that specifically for the library school, I saw all of, (laughter) all of those pretty metal boxes and I thought I was in the post office (laughter).  I had worked in the library at Huston, at, at Tillotson [Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] but we just had little card files (laughter) and we didn't, we didn't have all, all of those.  I told that, told that to, to our current president, Dr. Powers [William C. Powers, Jr.], I thought he would never stop laughing.  The reason I thought about it was he had a reception in his office and I looked up and I said, "Oh, there's my library."  And (laughter) so I told him, I honestly I thought that man would, (laughter) would never stop laughing.
Story_ID: 620348
Speaker 1: I thought there was a time that the class would give you, the teacher would give you the day off when they visited the Texas State Library and the archives [Texas State Library and Archives Commission, Austin, Texas] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, now the Texas State Library--
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: --was another story.  And so the day that they, (laughter) my class was to go to the state library I was given the day off.  It's, and then when we would take trips, field trips, you know, there was a, a Pearland [Texas] near Houston [Texas].  And then there were some up in the hill country, near Fredericksburg [Texas], near President Johnson's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] home.  When, when we got ready to go to Pearland, they said, they had, you could sign up on the, on the bulletin board, and they said, "Oh, god, Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson] we were sure hoping you wouldn't," (laughter), "sign up."  So they explained to me that that was not a good thing for me to anticipate (laughter).  And then another time we were going to, up near Fredericksburg and we were just taking the car that's not very far, it's up by the LBJ Ranch [Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park].  And so when I signed up the same, you know, the same thing.  So I had, had one really good friend that was just delightful, she said, "Ada, I'll tell you what," she said, I--we were supposed to, on the way to Fredericksburg, we were supposed to stop at the home of, we had one student who came, I, and I think it might have been in the summer, and she was an older lady and she was very, very proud of the fact that her uncle or grandfather or somebody was a colonel in the, in the, you know, the army, civil rights, I mean, civil, civil, what am I trying to say?  It's the Civil War is what I'm trying to say.  And so she bragged about it all the time.  And but she would not even get close to me, she would speak but it was really funny, it was kind of a joke in the class.  And my youngest sister [Thelma Collins] had completed all of her coursework at Samuel Huston [Samuel Huston College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] and she was really kind of, you know, what do I do now, I got a whole semester.  I said, "Well, why don't you come over and go, you know, sign, go with me," so she said, "Okay."  But my sister is very fair and (laughter) we had different last names so this lady didn't connect us and she loved my sister.  So my friends would always laugh and say, "Wait 'til, wait one day," (laughter), "Ada, she puts on some, some of your powder" (laughter).  I said, "That'll fix her" (laughter).  But when we were going up to, to, toward the ranch well, this was, we were gonna stop and have some snacks or breakfast and brunch at her daughter's house and so she said, "Now, Ada can't stop, Ada, can't go to my daughter's house."  I said, "Okay."  So we just drove on to our final destination (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was the only really crazy experience that I had (laughter) there [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].
Story_ID: 620349
Speaker 1: What happens after you, you finish there?
Speaker 2: At--
Speaker 1: Yeah, at the University of Texas at Austin [Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: When I, when I completed what I was gonna do with library science, excuse me, I, I really took some time off because by this time my daughter [Sandra Anderson Baccus] is in junior high 'cause I, I didn't take full loads, I would take a couple of courses, sometimes three at a time.  And I discovered I needed full time, I was a full time taxi driver (laughter) with just my kids.  The, but then by the time they were in high school I went back then and got my master's in, in ed= educational psychology.
Speaker 1: Now, that, that's an interesting, that's interesting, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: The (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And why did, why did you choose that major?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always been interested in education but I was interested in counseling.  So many kids that I was around, you know, the parents said that the kids had such poor counselors.  And so I was interested in, in, in counseling.
Story_ID: 620350
Speaker 1: What happened, the, then I took a job after I had gotten my degree, well, I hadn't gotten a degree I was still in school [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], but I took a job with the, what was then the Texas Employment Commission, it's called workforce commission in Texas now [Texas Workforce Commission]. I don't know what it's called other places.  And the, I was really, well, I had been doing a lot of civil rights stuff trying to open up job opportunities and the, our Congressman, J.J. "Jake" Pickle [J.J. Pickle], insisted--'cause he had been the, one of the commissioners for the employment commission--so he insisted that I take a job there (laughter) simply because they had not had a black, an African American professional before, so he was determined.  When he won his congressional seat then he was determined that I would take that job, which I did.  And it was really fascinating.  The, I was first assigned to the, the maid's desk, and there was one other person Nita Watham [ph.] was on the maid's desk and she was the one who taught me what, you know, the ropes, so to speak.  And they were paying those women fifty cents an hour.  And so as soon as I got there I would say--what, and what would happen, these are day workers, and what would happen is the, the white women would call in and say they wanted a maid for that day and so we would assign them and they would then leave, they'd just come and sit like they're in a classroom.  And then Nita and I would, would give them their assignment and they'd go off and they'd work that day.  And so by the time I was there a few days, I would say to them, I said, "You know, we have a, a couple of ladies here who are really very good at what they do," but I said, "They get seventy-five cents an hour," so we got it raised to seventy-five.  And it wasn't long before same, I said the same thing about a dollar an hour.  By the time we got it raised--and so Nita would do, you know, after I started it then, she also did the same thing.
Story_ID: 620351
Speaker 1: And I wasn't there very long, very long but I was the only who had had enough background, I was qualified to be a counselor and it, it was nobody else in the, in the local office [of the Texas Employment Commission; Texas Workforce Commission] that could be a counselor so I was promoted to a counselor and I did all of the testing, aptitude testing, all of it for this whole area.  And the, and, and I did all the testing for the, for the labor unions.  They did not permit African Americans to take any tests, nothing, nada, nothing.  Hispanics could only take one thing, I only remember one thing, it might have been two but it was whatever was the most undesirable thing that you could possibly imagine.  And at that time they were using for, for insulation, what is that stuff, it's, it, it just cuts your, it's, I can look, I can see it now, little pink stuff and it was, they used it in, in all of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fiberglass, is it fiberglass?
Speaker 1: Fiberglass.  That was the only thing Hispanics could take.  And everything else the white folks could take but they couldn't take electrical, they couldn't take plumbing, they couldn't take any of those, those tests.  The--I also did the test for clerical workers.  And from time to time they had courses that would help the, the clerical workers hone their skills.  And the, excuse me, when a clerical worker would come in, they would, two sisters, one my color and one fair, two sisters, they would give them, the, the one my color would not get a referral and they were pretty consistent about that.  And they had to teach--then I, when I started interviewing they had to teach me the system and by this time we'd had some legislation that affected all of that so you didn't just blatantly say it's, you know, it's race, it's race based.  So when a new person would come in to apply for a job, if it were an African American, we had little cards like this with the form printed on it and at the bottom it had, well you first you described them, and you--kind of their demeanor, and then you have a little section that you talk about, you, you describe any comments you want, remarks, it's marked, it was remark.  So if it were an African American they would always start the first sentence with courteous or anything that started with a C for colored.  And if it were Hispanic they would--we used a pencil--and if it were Hispanic, you just kind of accidentally (laughter) hid a, you know, a little mark in the, in the remarks, you just kind of, as though your, your, your pencil kind of slipped.  Fascinating stuff (laughter).  We had, we had one man who owned a, a, a John Deere company in, in, not company what's the word?  You know, in Austin [Texas], anyway a dealership in Austin.  And periodically he would call for a cook (laughter) and he would say, "I want one of those big, fat black mammy types that can cook" (laughter).  So I would just go and take all of his information and never comment.  I said, "One of these days he's gone walk in this office and ask for me" 'cause I apparently was his favorite (laughter).  One day he came in and asked for Mrs. Anderson [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson] and they brought him to my desk (laughter) and he acted as though, you know, absolutely nothing had happened and he did not use (laughter) that same language.  And I was still there longer, you know, and he would call in, (laughter) he didn't use the same--he still would call for me but (laughter) he wouldn't use the same language.
Story_ID: 620352
Speaker 1: But let me ask you this.
Speaker 2: I made 'em all comfortable (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year did you work, and, and there was a, a name for this type of work that you did, psycho--
Speaker 2: At the ba- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) metrics?
Speaker 2: Oh, psycha- I was, oh, oh, I was later with the public schools I was called a psychometrist, which was--
Speaker 1: Well, this wasn't the time that you were working for the public schools?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: This was a different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was at the employment commission [Texas Employment Commission; Texas Workforce Commission].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Public schools came later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know what year this was you, we went to, that we're in?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, I told you I don't ever remember a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean, was it before or after you had went through the library science?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was afterwards.
Speaker 1: It was afterwards.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So we're in the 19- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, by that, by that time, then I was, I guess I already had my master's [degree]. No, I didn't, I didn't have my master's.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But we're still, we're, well--
Speaker 2: I was still working on it.  I was still working on it.
Speaker 1: --we know that we're in like 1950 something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All righty.  So--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --what happens when you leave that job (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, and let me tell you. I be- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Something else?
Speaker 2: Before, before you leave the employment commission--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --(laughter) let me tell you.  At this time I, as I told you I was doing a lot of civil rights work (laughter) opening up, trying to open up stuff in Austin [Texas].  And a friend of mine who was white she and I would go to, everything was, was segregated, there were no blacks in the telephone company, none in the city, you know, water and light, none in the, in the gas company, none of the utilities, none of 'em.  And so I would go in, (laughter) she and I would ride together downtown and I would go in the office and I would apply and they would either say they had nothing or that I was overqualified, so they kind of moved, you know.  Then she would go in, even before I left, I just wouldn't, you know, wouldn't acknowledge her presence and I would leave.  And then I'd wait for her (laughter) in the car.  And, of course, they'd offer her a job.  She was, her husband was with the YMCA at the University of Texas [University of Texas YMCA, Austin, Texas].  And (laughter) but we did a lot of that kind of thing.  And by this time they had finally installed meters in Austin, for a long time Austin was such a small town we didn't have parking meters.  And I said, "They don't even have," they called 'em parkadettes when they were (unclear), they don't even have a parkadette coin collecting money.  But it was crazy.  And the thing was though that we had, you had black restaurants.  We had a, a black builder that owned his own lumber company.  And we had a lot of black, small black businesses.  And after integration it just kind of lost it all, you know, over time.  (Laughter) But that was really something.
Story_ID: 620353
Speaker 1: But anyway while I was at the employment commission [Texas Employment Commission; Texas Workforce Commission] the, we were, one of the things that we were working on was to get a human relations ordinance passed by the Austin City Council.  And (laughter) I, I took an afternoon leave and I didn't tell 'em where I was going, I mean, I, you know, it was my time.  And they was, it was actually a, a, a group that I had organized at our own home which was, I had twenty-two people for lunch at my house, couldn't go to a restaurant, and we had, we had a professor from the University of Texas School of Law [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas], we had a couple of professors, we had the president of the downtown Merchants Association [Greater Austin Merchants Cooperative Association], we had someone from the theaters, and someone from the hotel association [Austin Hotel and Motel Association], had my minister that you interviewed this morning, no, it was my minister but that was before Reverend Griffin [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Marvin Griffin] came, it was a different person.  And we had the minister from the Mexican Catholic church, we had the minister from First Baptist Church [First Baptist Church of Austin, Austin, Texas] downtown who was a young, tall, big guy, red hair, (laughter) absolutely delightful.  In fact, he was our first chairman.  And we had, I said the Hispanic priest from, from, and we had the president of, of, Dr. Raymond Fleck from St. Edward's University [Austin, Texas].  And anyway those were the kind of, we had a total of twenty-two people.  And my husband [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] had just served as the first--again everything's the first African American--as one of the vice presidents for the state Democratic committee that had met in El Paso [Texas] and El Paso had passed an ordinance, hotels, motels, and restaurants.  And so my husband (laughter) met the attorney who had, who had, you know, helped put all of that together and they had, had adopted it.  So he told them, the attorney that, he said, "My wife would be really," (laughter), "interested in this."  And so he took my husband to his office and gave him all of the documents and everything and how they had done it.  And so he brought it back and that was the information that I had to distribute to the people I had at my house and to see how many people actually wanted to, wanted to work on it.  And Chester Snyder [ph.] was the chairman of the downtown merchants association, his wife, Irene [ph.], and I were best friends.  In fact, they, so anyway that, that was the group.  And one of my friends prepared the food, she was a real good cook.  So she (laughter) prepared the lunch and food and served it for us.  So that was what we started out to do.  And we, we would meet, we would meet downtown a lot of times but we would kind of go in separately and we kept our roster separate from the minutes.  And one day the--we were meeting at one of the downtown hotels. It was, it was almost, it was a relatively new hotel, and the, the manager was part of our committee so he--and we met there a lot but we'd kind of go in one at a time, you know, it was all that kind of craziness.  And so he say (laughter) when we opened the meeting, he said, "Well, I'm happy to announce today that the," what did he call it, "the, the straight, the straight up, straight up hotels are integrated as of today," meaning that the motels were not.  And I remember so clearly I said, "This is April 1st," and we, we were gonna have a, a press conference, so we had the press conference, (laughter) "they are going to think it's an April Fool," (laughter), "joke."

Speaker 1: But anyway, back to the--so after that we were, we were going to the city council [Austin City Council] to get them to adopt the ordinance and we had gotten one of the professors from UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] had drafted the ordinance.  And so I took, that's when I, going back, when I took some time off one afternoon or at noon and, you know, from the employment commission [Texas Employment Commission; Texas Workforce Commission].  So when we got there we had arranged who was gonna speak and there were three of us who were gonna speak.  So I talked about the things I just told, told you, the, how the, the hotels and motels and restaurants were all closed and the employment was closed and, you know, just a whole bit, I went on down the line.  (Laughter) When I came to, when I came to work the next morning the, the, the, the head lady said, no, my supervisor at the employment commission said, when I walked in the door, he said, "Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson], Ada, come on, come on, come here right now.  Don't stop, don't stop.  You got to go straight to the supervisor's," (laughter), "office.  Don't stop, don't stop," he escorted me down there.  And there were the commissioners from the state office. I was in the local office. There were all three commissioners from the state office, and they said, "You were at the city council, and, and you talked about all of our clients."  And I said, "Well, I just told 'em the truth."  And they kept going in that direction.  Finally they said, "Can't say you anything when I just told the truth?"  I said, "What else is there?"  So that same afternoon (laughter) I was going to Dallas [Texas], actually to a Democratic meeting, and so, (laughter) they said, "Do you think," and, you know, I had to leave to go to Dallas, "do you think you can make it all the way to Dallas," (laughter), "without talking about our clients?"  I said, "We'll see."  Well, I got to Dallas and the, our attorney general and I were walking down, (laughter) walking down the hall, there was nobody else in that hallway at the hotel, just the two of us, and anyway that was the only picture they showed on the Dallas news that (laughter) evening.  And, of course, they saw it in Austin [Texas].  (Laughter) All you can say is I'm telling the truth, yep.
Speaker 2: So was the ordinance passed?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Was the ordinance passed?
Speaker 1: Yeah, eventually we got it passed.  The, and we did get a Human Relations Commission [Austin Human Relations Commission; Austin Human Rights Commission] actually appointed.  The, oh, you know, just a lot of stuff.  The, by the time we got, I guess by the time the city council was really considering it, debating it, then the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and some other organizations, black organizations came and filled up the, the, you know, the city hall, the mayor's desk, our mayor's office, the city council office rather not the mayor's office.
Story_ID: 620355
Speaker 1: Do you remember the first time that you voted?
Speaker 2: As soon as I was old enough to vote I got a, a poll tax.  You know, the interesting thing is that living in, in the rural district there were some, my parents [Cecilia Rucker Collins and Walter Collins] could vote, I can remember them talking about the county judge they could vote for but I don't remember who else they could vote for.  And, of course, they could vote in the, in the general election but couldn't vote in the primary election.  And the, the, Texas was a hundred, a hundred percent Democratic. There were no Republicans. The Republican Party didn't even exist in Texas.  So all of those really, the liberals, the conservatives, and everybody belonged to the Democratic Party in Austin, in Texas.  But I can never remember a time when my parents didn't go and vote even though I didn't know what they were voting for, I just remembered hearing them say that the county judge (laughter), I remember that.  But I just thought that's something that if you didn't do, I mean, you had to do that and I would feel guilty today if there were any election that I didn't vote in.  And my children grew up the same way.
Speaker 1: They, they changed the, African Americans were able to register and to vote in the Democratic primary, I think that was changed in about 1944.
Speaker 2: But we were still, we had the poll tax.  In fact, we still had the poll tax when my daughter cast her first ballot.  She had to be twenty-one then (laughter).  When she became twenty-one she, she was home, she had been away at, at college, she was home and we went down to, to register together.  And my kids had always helped to work the polls and, you know, so they grew up with all of, (laughter) all of this experience.  And so they said that, they would do telephoning, you know, (laughter) with our precinct and they said that, "Mother, you're the oldest person in our precinct."  Said, "Everybody else," said, "you're the only one who tells the truth about your age."  And they would tease me about it.  So one of the, one of the very active women was born the same year I was and according to her age she would have been six years old when she graduated (laughter) from high school (laughter).  So anyway my daughter and I went down to register together and she, she, she was twenty-one.  So a lot of the women would say over twenty-one as their, their age on, on the precinct list.  So I said, "Okay, then I'll be over twenty-one."  It was so funny, the next year they had the computers and Sandra [Sandra Anderson Baccus] and I both were twenty-two (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's something.  When she was twenty-one that would have been what, 1964 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, she was born in '45 [1945] so you--
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945].
Speaker 2: --you do the math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You do the math.
Speaker 1: But a poll tax in the 1960s--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --just is amazing to me.  Okay.  When (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they had, they had to be sued before we could get rid of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you know about that, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: I didn't, I, I was not involved in that.
Speaker 1: Oh, you weren't involved, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The, one of the--
Speaker 1: --that's one thing you weren't involved in.
Speaker 2: Yeah, one, no, one of the professors at Huston Tillotson [Huston Tillotson College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] was very active and he's the one who, who really got that changed.
Story_ID: 620356
Speaker 1: So when did you work for the Austin Independent School District?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My story (laughter).  The, working at the employment commission [Texas Employment Commission; Texas Workforce Commission] I became really interested in employment and, you know, the, all the awful things that happened along that line and I had had some volunteer experience with it as well.  And so I decided to, I was still taking courses while I was there.  I had a lot of courses (laughter). I, you know, I like to go to school.  So the, well, I lost my train of thought (laughter) there.
Speaker 1: And you were talking about you were interested in, in--
Speaker 2: Oh, in employment (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) employment.
Speaker 2: So I did my, my thesis on the attitude of employers about race and their hiring practices.  And I think I had the easiest thesis in the entire world.  What I did was I took the, the classified ads, employment section of classified ads for the month of June and looked for those and, and any, if people, my theory was that if they were advertising for an employee that meant they had an opening.  So I organized them in categories 'cause having worked at employment commission I knew all of those, all the, the, you know, how to organize it.  And the, I did all of my interviews either by mail or by phone 'cause I had been out there too much, (laughter) they, they knew my name and they knew my face 'cause I had done school integration, I just had done a whole bunch of stuff.  So I used, I really didn't even use my middle name, I used Cecile, so I was Cecile, they knew me as [HistoryMaker] Ada Anderson so I was Cecile Collins, a graduate student at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].  And, you know, and I had my questionnaire and so on.  And a lot of them would fill it out and send it back and then as I said a lot of them I did by telephone.  And I'll tell you about a couple of them that really (laughter) stood out.  The Texas National Guard that just really blew my mind.  That was by telephone and they said, "Oh, yeah, we had a nigger cook once" (laughter).  But I knew that some of, and, and then the other kind, kind of answers I got was that they liked, customers really liked to have African Americans as waiters and waitresses, they typically were very kind and even tempered.  They did not like Hispanics to wait tables, they were too impatient and their customers just did not like them.  Those were just, you know, a couple of things.  But at any rate, I, I had a copy of the, the, the first yearbook of, the original Anderson High School [L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, Texas] (laughter) and it would just make you cry.  One of the things they ask, you know, what do you wanna, what are your ambition, what do you wanna be when you graduate?  A cook--these are the women--a cook, maid, housewife, and maybe scattered in a teacher and that would be because that person's mother was a teacher.  The, the guys said waiter, service, work in a service station, you know, things like that.  And so I used that as an example and I interviewed the, the fathers of the current Anderson High School senior class as to what their, what their professions were or their occupations were.  And anyway that was kind of the basis of it.  And I (laughter) presented it to my professor.  He was so intrigued with it that he had, he made one or two corrections, he didn't want the nigger cook in there, he thought, he said, "You've, Ada you've made your point. You don't have to, you don't really have to have that."  And maybe one or two other things this, that or the.  Had his secretary type it up (laughter).  I got my degree in, in, in, in August.  That was in, that was in June, I got my degree (laughter) in August.
Story_ID: 620357
Speaker 1: So leading to the next step with, with the public schools, this is where we get to the public schools. This was before you could register online and all of that, you got in a line and you stood in those long lines at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], this huge university to register.  And this was a hot summer day.  And I was just registering so, you know, for my, for my degree, 'cause my thesis had been approved but I had to be registered for that summer session.  And we were in this long, hot, hot line and I started up a conversation to the person, I think he was in front of me and he turned around and we just started chatting.  And so he said, "Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson], do you have anything special you have to do when, when, when, when we leave here?"  I said, "Not really."  He said, "I want you to come with me over to my office."  He was, he headed the guidance department at the AISD [Austin Independent School District], (laughter) and so he had this little, this little bug that he was trying to--and I went back to his office and he hired me on the spot (laughter).  I hadn't even applied.  I had to fill out the forms, of course, there.  And I don't remember who, you know, any recommendations or anything on file, I think he probably got them maybe from my, I don't, I don't recall anymore.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you remember what year this was?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Here you go with years.  I can look at my thesis and see what year (laughter) I got my degree.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So tell me more about the, about your job now.  You were an administrator in, in school psychological and--testing right?
Speaker 1: Right after--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --right after he hired me he was diagnosed with cancer and didn't live too much longer.  And his replacement was a young good looking (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --youngster who had just gotten his first Ph.D. from UT, this was in the, Matt Snapp [Matthew Snapp].  And I just, we all adored Matt.  Well, we liked our previous person too.  And so Matt said, "Well, Ada, you're qualified for associate psychologist to be licensed by the state."  I said, "I do?"  And so he, you know, got all the documents and everything so then I was registered, I was, as associate psychologist.  And I was in this small office with Darlene Kaufman [ph.] who was the, my supervisor, and Princess Wagner [ph.].  It was just the three of us who did all the testing for the public schools.  And the, the way that worked was when the teachers had a, a child with problems, they would make a referral and we would just, and they would, they would just stack the referrals in a little container and we'd go by and select the schools where we wanted to go.  And I made my first year I decided that I wanted to go to every school if I could, if I could get, you know, go to that many 'cause just to know something about the district.  And so that was what I did.  It was very interesting, some interesting cases.
Story_ID: 620358
Speaker 1: Can you think of one that you had (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can think of two that stand out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One was a little boy, a little Hispanic boy who was, excuse me, in kindergarten, so we went the whole gamut.  And he was severely, severely retarded and but he had one thing he could do, and do it well, he could draw service stations. I mean, he did them perfectly, Conoco [Continental Oil Company; ConocoPhillips], Gulf [Gulf Oil], all of 'em, beautiful.  I want, I want, I wanted to keep 'em, (laughter) I wanted to save 'em.  He couldn't talk, he was severely handicapped.  The other thing about most of those young Hispanic kids were, was that their teeth were just rotted out, they were just hulls.  So, you know, how could they chew?  How could they get nourishment?  The, another case which was on the opposite end (laughter) that stood out was one, Highland Park School [Highland Park Elementary School, Austin, Texas] which is one that serves this, this subdivision is in the Highland Park school district.  And they had, it was a wonderful, I loved that school.  The, the, they had all these educated parents, you know, who were very supportive and who volunteered all the time and, you know, it was just a great school.  In, in fact, one of my cousins even taught there (laughter).  She loved it too.  And this was a really bright girl who was I think in the sixth grade, fifth or sixth grade at that time, and her parents owned some men's stores here and the mother had decided to open up a real estate firm, and these were people who were, you know, were our friends.  And I tested that girl, really, really bright but absolutely could not understand the concept of numbers.  It was just a pure deficit.  And she, so I gave my diagnoses and, you know, met with the parents, and the parents, the, parents, the teacher and the, the principal always met so that we could, you know, discuss our findings because all of these people had something to do with the kid.  And that was what, that was one of the things that just made it so nice.  Well, fast forward, fast forward a few years, I went to a luncheon--
Story_ID: 620359
Speaker 1: Continue to tell me the story about the little girl.  So you said fast forward a couple of years.
Speaker 2: A few years.  And I walked in to a luncheon and her mother saw me and she came, "Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson], come here, come here.  This is the happiest day of my life and I got you to thank for it."  She said 'cause, you know, I was the first person to diagnosis her, her problem.  And she had gone to, you know, up to Houston [Texas], to the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], a lot of, everybody came up with the same diagnosis.  And she said, "Today my daughter graduated from the University of Texas with a bachelor's degree."  And what had happened was that the University of Texas worked out some, so that the, and I don't even remember what her degree was in specifically, but something where she didn't have to have math.  They had worked out a special program for her and she had gotten her degree.  "Happiest day of my life" she- (laughter) her mother said.
Story_ID: 620360
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay at the, doing that job?
Speaker 2: About six, seven years.  And then I--my husband [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] had decided to, to part time (laughter) to open up a real estate firm, real estate and insurance [Anderson Wormley Real Estate and Insurance Company, Austin, Texas], we did insurance first and then added the real estate later.  And that was fire and casualty insurance company.  And the--and shortly thereafter he, he was a real entrepreneur. He was an educator but he was also an entrepreneur, he has always had all kind of businesses.  And he was, I think, the second African American in the state to get a real estate license because black people could just, just sell real estate, no license or nothing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: If they chose to do it, yeah, they didn't care.  And (laughter) nobody cared.  And the, the way the, the insurance business worked was that you, you had to get, it's really in three, three, you start with the company, then you have what you call a general agent who might represent four or five or any number of companies.  The general agent then, we call it making a plant with a local recording agent and they're the ones who actually talk to the customers and write the policies, so we had our general, recording agents.  And, and then later we--and, and that was, it was really interesting.  Later there was a, an African American who owned a funeral home and a lot of other businesses in Galveston [Texas].  And then he partnered with Carter Wesley [Carter Walker Wesley] who owned the Informer [Houston Informer] newspaper and he was in Houston [Texas] and so the two of them opened up a company.  So then we also in addition to what we already had in our office, we also had a plant (laughter) with, it was called, Guv State, Great State [ph.], Great, anyway, I think it was Great State or something like that.  Anyway, so by this time we were made (laughter) general agents which meant we could get other recording agents (laughter) to work for us.  And the recording agent that originally made it impossible for us to go in business then took a plant from us. It was the funniest thing. It was all of us (laughter) intertwining of the, of the, of companies.  That was fascinating.  I, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I, I did all the training for the, and supervising the clerical staff and everything for the company.
Story_ID: 620361
Speaker 1: And then I took some time off--I probably should finish that story because by now we're getting up to the '70s [1970s].  And I took some time off and went to University of Chicago and the business school [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] on, for, well, it was insurance because, I mean it was a business school (laughter).  I went, the, the first time I went was, went in the summer.  I don't know if you followed all of (laughter) these details I'm telling you.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We, the business school is in the University of Chicago?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Is that what you said (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the business--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --taking business.  And to, for you to help figure out the, the date on that, I know the approximate date but I'll let you figure out the date. I arrived (laughter) on, at the campus on a beautiful sunshiny Sunday afternoon and the, the business school, you had a, the lake [Lake Michigan] and then you had, you know, sandy beach and then you had the street and then you had the building in that order.  When I arrived in a taxi cab (laughter) the women were on this beach by the water burning bras.  So you (laughter) can tell what period in our history I'm talking about.  But do you wanna, (laughter) wanna hear about my experiences there?
Speaker 2: Well, we, before we move to that era let's just go back to a few things that happened before that time.  You worked with the, helped found the Austin Chapter of Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You wanna tell me about that?
Speaker 1: Why don't I finish that other story before I get to Jack and Jill 'cause Jack and Jill got its own story?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it'll get, get confused with my, my business story.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, go ahead.  Talk about your business story but we know that we're in the future here in Chicago [Illinois] and we're gonna have to go back a little bit but that's okay.  Okay.  So tell me about Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When I got there, there were a hundred and fifty men and me (laughter).  And (laughter) they had--they were wonderful though, they really were.  They were very respectful and, you know, and, and they, we were just classmates.  The, but the only females in, in that, in the business school, and I was taking banking, and the only females in there were the, the clerical workers.  And their restroom was on the second or third floor, I've forgotten, and we were on the first floor.  I said later for that.  I discovered the men's and they had a huge, well, I had gone to the women's and it was just, it was just so so.  I went in the men's and they had this huge gorgeous lounge that you could rest, stretch out, and you walk through and then that's where the, where the toilets were (laughter).  So I said, "Um-hm."  So (laughter) I would go down there during breaks and relax in the lounge (laughter).  It was so funny, the guys would come walking through, then suddenly (laughter) they would see me and then they'd go on in (laughter).  I can't remember anybody ever (laughter) saying anything except, you know, "Hello," you know, those that I knew.  The next year, two other women joined me (laughter) and I taught them all the ropes (laughter) and all the things that I had learned.  So when I graduated three years later the, I had, the three women and a hundred and fifty men in my graduating class.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was taking banking and mortgage banking and so on because we had started the real estate firm and it was a matter of, and, and, and learning how to, you know, we got a lot of information on financing and so on.  And so anyway that was a, a very interesting experience.
Speaker 2: Do you remember some of the, the instructors?
Speaker 1: You know, one of them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or did you--
Speaker 1: --one of them actually was from Austin [Texas] and he was the, he headed up I think FHA [Federal Housing Administration]. He was the national, the presidential appointee to head up FHA.
Speaker 2: Can you remember his name?
Speaker 1: I can see his office down on Lamar Boulevard.  I may be able to think of it.  I can see his face (laughter).  They, yeah, that was a long time ago.
Story_ID: 620362
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you put these skills to use in your company [Anderson Wormley Real Estate and Insurance Company] when you came back to Austin [Texas]. Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: About what?  Our, our (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About your company, yes.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I kind of told you basically.  We had, when we got, as I told you, with, with our local company a plant (laughter) we had not been trained in, in any of, any of, all the ways of, of running a agency.  So we did two things, the agency was called Aldridge [ph.], I think of Aldridge (unclear).  We, I went and, and, you know, spent some time in their office just learning how they did things.  But then they assigned one of their guys, one of their managers to come and work in our office until we really learned the business because there was nowhere for us to learn it otherwise.  The, my husband [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson], I told you was an entrepreneur, and he decided that, well, he decided that he wanted to organize a life insurance company (laughter).  We had, by this time we had become very active politically and John Connally was the governor and so John made it possible for him to get the, get the charter for the life insurance company (laughter).  I have a friend who says if you live long enough you get into a lot of things.  So I think I've lived long enough (laughter) to get into a lot of things so this goes on and on.
Speaker 1: So what was that like, adding that new addition to the business?
Speaker 2: The life insurance?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: I didn't do anything with (laughter) that life insurance.  He had his own board of directors and his own agents and his own stuff.  I, no, that was his, his deal.  The (laughter) and he was always mentoring young people, especially the guys, but both the girls as well, well, both of us did a lot of mentoring, mentoring.  The--so he would have, he would, he would teach them the insurance that, the life insurance, I taught everybody else the fire and casualty.  I loved it.
Story_ID: 620363
Speaker 1: So tell me what happens next.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: In your life (laughter)?
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: You said you became politically active by this time.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that you were doing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, actually my husband [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] was really the politician, I was just, oh, also ran. The--but this is a fascinating story I'm trying to think that picture over, there are some pictures over there.  The, when Lyndon Johnson [Lyndon Baines Johnson] was, he was vice president, and I was invited to a conference for, for black folks by Lyndon.  And I can't even remember what the conference was about now but there must have been about, I don't know fifteen, twenty of us total.  And when we went, when we went out for lunch for some unknown reason I was the first one to come back into the room and he said, Vice President Johnson said, "Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson], come over here, I want you to meet," the, Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was president, and he says, "I want you to meet our attorney general, Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]."  And so it was only the three of us standing there on this little stage, it was about this tall and maybe that tall.  And he, he took me over and introduced me and he told her that, said, "You know, we wanna send John," John Connally was the secretary of the navy, he said, "We wanna send John Connally back to Texas to run for governor and Mrs. Anderson and her husband are active politically," and so, and that was, you know, all he said.
Story_ID: 620364
Speaker 1: So Bobby [Robert F. Kennedy] put his arms around my shoulder, he wasn't much taller than me, (laughter) put his arms around my shoulder and he said that, "We want John Connally to come back and run for, for governor."  He said, "As attorney general it's so important that we have governors in these southern states that we can work with.  And so John has said that he's willing to go."  And that just, so I came back and I told, told my husband.  And so Andy [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] said, "I don't, I have no idea who that is but I will find out quickly" (laughter).  And he did and John just became, we called him Big John, he just became a good friend.  And he was considered politically conservative by the political ultraliberal part of, of Texas.  So there was kind of friction between our Senator Yarborough, Ralph, Ralph Yarborough and John Connally.  The--so we were considered the conservatives (laughter).  But John said--so Andy organized, he got a, a, a group of leaders in Texas together and introduced them to Big John and organized what they called, United Political Organization of Texas, known as UPO.  And they worked really hard to get Big John elected.  And John had told them that now, what, they had discussed before they agreed to, to, to, to work for him, for his election, they told him what they wanted and I had described for you what employment for African Americans was like in Austin [Texas] and it was like that all, all over the state.  As, as my dad [Walter Collins] used to say, "Wasn't a nickel worth of difference" (laughter).  And so they outlined all of the things that they wanted and the first was jobs, and they went in great detail about that and the other was appointments on boards and commissions, there were no, there was, there were no black folks in state government just like I described for you in our local government.  And so he said, you know, he, he thought that was a good idea.  Had the best memory.  Boy, he could see you, a room full of people and name everybody, (laughter) he was really something.  He, meaning John Connally.  So anyway we were, we became very active.  The, as I said he was, my husband was, was the lead person but, and then a lot of times he was out of town and I would, I would fill in for him.  And the, after, after Big John was elected he, right after he was elected he, Andy had so many other (laughter) things going on so he was out of town a lot of the time.  And he called a meeting of the heads of every board and commission in Texas, met out at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] and its, in, the room was one in a theater shaped only it was a pretty deep, you know, drop off, and the stage was like yay high.  The, and when the, when they met, Andy was, as I say, he was out of town, so I went, I still remember that red, red suit I had on.  And he, Big John sat me not on the stage but next to the stage right in front of him facing the audience.  And so he told them, I mean, then he had, had someone escort me to the stage and he introduced me and told them that, you know, he had been working with Andy and so on.  And he says, "Now, you will go back and you will employ African Americans and you will come back and meet here with me," and he gave 'em a timeframe, "and let me know the progress."  And in the meantime Andy had, (laughter) as UPO head what he called his board which was, you know, all of 'em, and (laughter) he had had that board to make up a list of people that they thought, African Americans, they thought was qualified for the various positions and presented it to Big John.  And so he proceeded with that.  It was kind of interesting because Ralph Yarborough represented labor and I told you what labor was like so, you know, I was mad at them.  And the, but black folks all basically except for our group supported Ralph Yarborough and they didn't like John Connally, you know, at that time, they didn't like John at all.  And there were several, you know, situations, I won't go into all of those but that was the way it was.
Story_ID: 620365
Speaker 1: We went to, (background noise) and with the, the just to give you some example of, of the other part of that, the, his inauguration for example.  It was the first time African Americans could attend the inaugural ball.  What they had previously done was having a separate one over in the black community and the governor and his entourage would come by for a few minutes, you know, say hello and leave.  Well, at the inauguration they, the people who really--well, Andy [Anderson's husband, Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] and I both worked on it, but Andy mostly, the, all the planning for the inauguration on all the committees and stuff and he had his people, he had his, Andy had his people on all those committees.  And so they were, they could, brought their guests and were all invited to the inauguration.  And Andy and I when he introduced his cabinet and then he also introduced us and we had this march down the center, center of the auditorium, the first African Americans, you know, first time that ever happened.  (Laughter) And all of Andy's UPO [United Political Organization of Texas] board were all there and others.  He, they had put together a, a guest list, and so they had, we had a lot of African Americans there, first time.  And (laughter) one of them was a minister who was very, very, he was a young minister, he was very, very, (laughter) very comical and this super sense of humor, and (laughter) he said that the guests were, 'cause he had on his tux, were inviting him over to, to come and get them some ice and to get them, (laughter) by the way we didn't have what, liquor by the drink, have you ever heard of that?  (Laughter) So you had to, (laughter) you had the liquor, liquor by the bottle.  But so they could bring the, the, the setups, you know, the ice and the glasses and stuff.  And so (laughter) this one, one guest (laughter) said, "Oh, yeah," said, "I got some good tips," (laughter) you know, you might as well make a joke out of it and have fun.  But and, and as I told you I have a, a, two pictures over there of, of President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] at that particular meeting.
Story_ID: 620366
Speaker 1: And so with all these businesses that you and your husband--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --start, y'all create a coalition of businesses?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: You know, we just hired, hired folks (laughter) (unclear).
Speaker 1: So how did the City of Austin's [Austin, Texas]--
Speaker 2: But, but, but he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) human relations commission [Austin Human Relations Commission; Austin Human Rights Commission] come--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How did the City of Austin's human relations commission come about?
Speaker 2: That was the one I told you where we were opening the hotels, motels, and restaurants but along with that, that's what the human relations was expected to do that and whatever else, you know, needed--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --expanded.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they hired a director and we had a young African American women to, who was an attorney to head up the first group.
Speaker 1: Well, it, it seems that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was something I chose not to serve on. I, you know, that would tie me down too much.  I wasn't about to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You talked about Vice President Lyndon Johnson [Lyndon Baines Johnson] but you are friends with his wife and daughter.  How did you meet--
Speaker 2: You know, I can't even remember it's been so long.  My dad [Walter Collins] was a friend of Lyndon's.  And then, and he and Connally were good friends and, you know.  I think I told you about we were invited to a lot of their functions there and so.  And Lady Bird [Lady Bird Johnson] was just one of the sweetest people in the world.  When I first met Luci [Luci Baines Johnson], Luci, I think she and I agreed that she was about seven years old, and we were at the ranch and Luci was always the talky one, the talkative one, and the little shorty, and Lynda [Lynda Bird Johnson Robb] was tall and rather reserved.  And that was the first time I remembered meeting the, the girls.  And the, they set out and met us when we drove up and Luci was welcoming us to come in, you know, and she would catch my hand and try to take me everywhere.  You know, and Lynda was just polite and very sweet.  And the, they had a lot of just little small functions there that we were invited to.  But, you know, it was so interesting.  And when, when, when John Connally left the governorship, then he was appointed by Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] I think to secretary of the treasury or maybe by Johnson, I can't remember.  Anyway, he was secretary of the treasury.  And he was sworn in at the White House [Washington, D.C.] and, and they had a luncheon for us there at the White House.  And the, there, there was this delightful group who are still my friends here locally who were part of, Andy [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] always called them Lyndon's kitchen cabinet, the, but, you know, we got to know all of his cabinet members.  And when, when Lyndon, I mean, when John Connally was sworn in as secretary of treasury, well, that group got a, a, a jet, private jet and there were about twenty, twenty, I guess, it was about twenty of us, flew to Washington [D.C.] (laughter) in this jet and we had food and drinks and stuff (laughter) on the way there.  Oh, we had the best time.  The and one of the things we did while we were there was they had a bus, I hadn't seen a bus equipped like that, I call it the party bus, but it was, you know, to take you around Washington.  And had, the seats were on the side and they always had food and liquor, (laughter) you know, and take us to see the sites in D.C.
Story_ID: 620367
Speaker 1: Here I wanted to ask you a question before we go ahead. We, do you wanna talk more about, about the school system here?
Speaker 2: Local school system?
Speaker 1: The, yeah, the independent school system [Austin Independent School District]. Well I, I forgot what (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, they're all integrated now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But is there a story about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I, I don't know if I told you, I don't know if I told you about the naming of it, of the new high school, the L.C., when they closed L.C. Anderson High School [Austin, Texas] about carrying the name on, I don't know if I told you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --how that happened.
Speaker 1: No, but more about the, is there more stories about the integration of the school systems?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's, let's do that.  I wanna talk about that, the integration of the school systems, the fact that about you being elected to the Austin Community College board [Austin Community College District, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then we're gonna talk about LEAP [Leadership Enrichment Arts Program].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So let, let's, let's do it in that order, okay?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But what do you want first?
Speaker 1: The integration of schools.
Speaker 2: Oh, I need to get rid of the chewing gum.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: It's like a good place to put it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're ready, ready?  Just one second.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You're okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Austin [Texas], Travis County, this is, is the county seat of Travis County and, of course, the seat of state government.  But this is the most liberal county in the state. It's kind of like, I always think of it like Atlanta [Georgia]. You got Atlanta and then you got Georgia (laughter).  Well, we got it, we got Austin and then we got Texas.  The, so when the schools were ordered desegregated immediately the Austin public schools were just ready to go gung ho and, and bus the black kids, not the white kids but to bus the black kids.  And then they realized that in other parts of the country they were opening one at a time, one grade at a time.  So they said, "Oh, well, we can do that."  So they started with, and they started at the top, not at the bottom.  And the year that they got to, I don't know if they really had gotten to the eighth grade or not but I think I worried those people so much.
Story_ID: 620368
Speaker 1: Anyway, I told that you that that's when my daughter left the, the black school at Kealing [Theodore Kealing Junior High School; Theodore Kealing Middle School, Austin, Texas], was in the eighth grade and went to the University Junior High [University Junior High School, Austin, Texas].  The--and by that time I think we had, we had two kids in, in Austin High [Stephen F. Austin High School, Austin, Texas], in high school, one of them was one of my cousins who lived with me, her family lived in, in Temple [Texas] but because it was a better school so she lived with me for three years, so her last three years in high school.  And I think it was just those two, no, my next door neighbor was the first year.  The second year, another one of my neighbors and, and, and my cousin whom I call a niece were the only ones there.  And then after that I think it just opened up.  They had, when they integrated the children they also took some black teachers as well.  And I don't recall that that was in the beginning, I think it might have been, you know, a year or so later.  One of the interesting things that happened when, when, when Sandra [Sandra Anderson Baccus] was there, my daughter, was that--I don't know, do you know Sandra?  You know.  Well, her hair was kind of brownish, sandy-ish, which I presume had something to do with it and, you know, and skin coloring and everything, she came home and she was laughing, she said, "Mother, I want you to see this, these," this was the English teacher, I guess it had to have been the English teacher, she said (laughter) "these are the sentences that we're supposed to do," whatever. Anyway that was the assignments, there was a, a type written assignment.  And she said--one of the things that I heard was something like, the lazy Mexican sleeping under his sombrero (laughter).  And I've forgotten what she had, it was something not so, so great about African Americans, I think they were lazy or they were, they were something.  Well, they had back to school night for parents shortly thereafter and so when, when Andy [Marcellus J. "Andy" Anderson] and I came in I said, "We're Sandra's parents."  "Oh, come right in.  She is a wonderful student, all A's."  (Laughter) Which she really was.  But (laughter) that was the last time they had that kind of an assignment.  And Sandra was the only one in her class (laughter) 'cause it was a big school.  The, but, you know, they had some of those slips.  Now, Sandra did not have a good counselor and she told Sandra that she was not college material.  And if she hadn't had parents that, you know, (laughter) handled the situation, she might have believed 'em.  And, and they also thought that as they got more black kids, they also thought all, all children, all of them should go to the University of Texas at Austin [Austin, Texas]. Everybody should go (laughter) that was the only, only place they knew.  But on the other hand two years later Jack [Marcellus J. Anderson, Jr.] had a wonderful counselor and he adored her and she adored him.  And she helped him with getting all of his papers, everything together for MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] 'cause that's where he decided he was going.  And the, you know, whatever, and when he would come back on, on, you know, on holidays and summers, he would go straight to visit her, if school was not in session, he'd go out to her house, loved her.  And she (laughter) it was, it was mutual.  And by this time I'd also done a stint and, and, and at, at, you know, in the public schools and so I knew her too as well.  But I really never knew Sandra's counselor very well.  Muriel [ph.] who was the cousin that lived with me, who was, I guess, two grades ahead of my daughter and she, she had a good counselor but her dad had gone to the University of Colorado so she had already made up her mind but she was very helpful to her.  But Sandra was not that fortunate.
Story_ID: 620369
Speaker 1: You wanted to talk to me about, tell us about the closing of L.C. Anderson High School [Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: The, the African American community was really unhappy about that.  I didn't participate too much in any of that because it, by that time both of my children [Sandra Anderson Baccus and Marcellus J. Anderson, Jr.] were in other, were in the integrated schools and I was, had all my hands full, (laughter) you know, with that.  So and, and the, and the, across the state and maybe across, you know, other places as well, but in Austin [Texas] every other year they still have a reunion and I don't know you may have the date that they closed it, I don't recall, the, and they still come back to Austin for a reunion.  And the other African Americans even though they went to the integrated schools, they also come back as part of the, they call it the original Anderson High, I always say the old Anderson, they say, "No, it's the original Anderson High" (laughter).
Story_ID: 620370
Speaker 1: You were elected the first African American to win a countrywide election?
Speaker 2: Countywide.
Speaker 1: Countywide, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, county.
Speaker 1: So tell me about that.
Speaker 2: As I said I've just always been interested in education and had never thought I, (laughter) I would run for anything.  But I had served on what they call a blue ribbon committee to study the needs of, of the Austin Community College [Austin Community College District, Austin, Texas].  They had, I don't know, over a hundred different sites, all of them were leased, didn't own any property.  When it was established it was, yeah, I guess that's the same time, anyway it was established with the original trustees being the trustees of the, of the Austin Independent School District.  So they were trustees for the school district and for the community college.  And I served on a, a, a blue ribbon, what they call a blue ribbon committee to study making it independent (laughter).  And I really became very, very interested in, in the needs of, of the community college.  And I thought then and I, as I still think, that is one of the most important educational institutions that you can have is a community college.  You know, they can quickly meet the needs of the local community without, you know, an established university, there's a lot more to changing a curriculum.  But with a community college you can just overnight have different courses and you, if, all you have to do is find the money and find the, you know, someone in the community that can teach it.  So the, what was on the ballot was the, the president of the college wanted to have it, a countywide, and it was just Austin [Texas] and so he wanted it countywide.  In fact, he really wanted it multicounty.  But so then I was, I think, there were twelve of us who were running for seven seats on the, on the board, and so I filed for that.  I had, I think, I think I raised five hundred dollars, I think, I had that much, didn't spend it all.  (Laughter) And I don't know what other people raised.  But, and one of the people who was, who was running, of the twelve, was a former president of this, of the Austin, of the school board and very well known, highly respected and one of them was the wife of a, a city manager who was very popular.  He had retired from the city management. He was doing something else but, you know, well known.  So all, all these well known people on the committee who were running.  What happened in that election was, that was to give us taxing authority and, you know, establish the boundaries.  Well, they established the college but gave it no money, they voted down the money (laughter).  But at any rate the newspaper the next morning had this big headline, 'cause this was a big deal, they had really been trying to get it, you know, there was just a lot of activity community wide.  So the big headline was [HistoryMaker] Ada Anderson won the, the beauty contest, meaning that (laughter) that we had a board but we didn't have anything to, (laughter) to preside over because, (laughter) because they didn't provide any money.  But anyway, I just thought that was an interesting, and that was all the new, the news.
Story_ID: 620371
Speaker 1: But then we, we were, then we were appointed the first year (laughter).  So after, you know, that time and then, and then we were appointed.  That was a really great experience for me.  I remember one of the, one of the highlights which had nothing to do directly with the college [Austin Community College District, Austin, Texas] but was going to Wall Street and, you know, checking out our, our bond rating and so on, by this time we were, we were getting, we were gonna get some funding (laughter).  And we bought the, and our, our, our, our board bought the first property and we bought a country club and started out, the first building were the country club buildings and but that also gave us a golf course which, which they still own.
Speaker 2: So you--
Speaker 1: That, that was--
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: That was a very good experience.  I served as secretary and I was on some committees, I think.  Anyway, a number of committees.  We had, and, and the former president of the school board, two former presidents of school boards were on, on that, of, of AI, Austin Independent School District, two of them were on that board.  Anyway it was, it was a nice group.  We had a contractor who was a very successful contractor.  It was, it was good.
Speaker 2: So you stay on the board for two years?
Speaker 1: Three.
Speaker 2: Three years, okay.
Speaker 1: I chose not to run again.  I, I had done that already.  Move on (laughter) to something else.
Story_ID: 620372
Speaker 1: So what, what did you move on to?
Speaker 2: Oh, god knows what.
Speaker 1: Is this coming up, where you established a leadership enrichment for the arts, LEAP?
Speaker 2: L-E-A-P, Leadership Enrichment Arts Program, not for the arts, arts program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was one of the founding members of the Austin Lyric Opera [Austin Opera].  Austin [Texas] had not had an opera company since back in the, the horse and buggy days, they had had an opera company here.  And excuse me, the--and this was in the '80s [1980s] and I don't know what possessed us to start a new company (laughter) and 'cause that's when we had the, the downturn in the economy from the savings and loan scandal, scandal and the real estate market did a (makes sound) a dip.  But we did and there were two things.  The, since we, the people who were familiar with opera in Austin was somebody typically who had lived other places.  So we didn't, we didn't have a built in audience.  And so all of us were, were, all of us on the board were looking for ways that we could expand our audience base.  And the thing that occurred to me was that the fact that African Americans had not been able to attend any of the fine arts except for the museum, the museum was open.  But symphony and well, that was all we had was the symphony until we established the opera.  And so, and I also knew that the current teenagers' parents had not been exposed.  So I decided to organize it not restricted to African Americans but that would be the primary focus.  And the teenagers and their parents, and you read some of the brochures there.  The, I, and my goal was not just exposing them to opera but to all the fine arts and also educational opportunities.  My thoughts were much broader than just the opera although opera was, it was an outreach of the opera and they were our sponsors.  And so we called 'em together and at the museum, which was the first place we met, and had a, there was a, some black businesswomen had a mentoring program for young African American teenagers, women, teenage girls.  And so I asked them if they would like to add another dimension to their program and they thought that was a good idea.  And I asked them to come to Laguna Gloria Art Museum [Laguna Gloria, Austin, Texas] on a Sunday afternoon and, and invite the kids and their parents and ask them to bring a favorite teacher.  And then the, the director of the opera was a wonderful storyteller.  And I asked him to come and to bring some of the cast members.  And it was, I'll tell you the name of the opera in a minute, Azalea Jones [ph.] an African American, it just so happened, it was 'The Magic Flute' [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] that's what it was.  And Azalea Jones was, had the lead role and the person playing opposite her was white.  And so the director brought both of them and he told them the story and then the, both of the performers told a little bit about their own life story and how they happened to be doing what they were doing.  (Laughter) It was so interesting.  The kids were just bouncing up and down in their seats, said, "I can't wait, I can't wait."  And so that's the way they started, just excited.
Story_ID: 620373
Speaker 1: And what we did always was to tell them the story and, you know, explain all of that to them, sometimes take them, a lot of times in, in the, in the beginning generally we'd take them to the dress rehearsal so they knew what was going on when they saw the real performance.  And I had explained to them all the careers that, from, from the arts, arts produced, you know, all kinds of careers.  And at that time you were building your own set, I mean, the, the companies were having their own sets built.  Well, you got the carpenters, you've got the chemists, you know, and I went on and on which covers about everything you can think of.  And 'cause I always tied it in with what kind of career does it lead to and, you know, I always got to make things broad (laughter).  And that was really the way we started.  I ran it for two years out of my office, I mean, for ten years out of my office.  And then we hired a, an executive director.  And right now we have an excellent executive director.  And I'm just really pleased.  Now, one of the things, we did, we just did so many things.  But one of the things was to take them traveling.  And the other one was to get them in summer programs across the country for, let me see, Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] was one of our first ones we took them to.  And I always told 'em, I said, "This is Hillary Clinton's [Hillary Rodham Clinton]," (laughter), "school."  It's a three week program, they had a hundred and fifty different things that they could choose from.  And they would pair them with, they had, students from I don't know how many countries, I guess, all the countries there are (laughter).  And they would pair them with someone their own age and from a different country, you know, one of the kids was, met somebody from Italy and somebody else had somebody from, from France and on and on.  The, and then as time moved on, at one time we had, (laughter) had 'em in nineteen different colleges and prep, prep schools across the country (laughter).  And that was the most I ever had in any one, one summer.  The, but we took them to, to Atlanta [Georgia], spent a week at, at Emory University in a brand new dormitory.  And, you know, I never said you need to go to college, they figured that out.  And I took 'em to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and they stayed at Georgetown [Georgetown University].  Tried to, when we took 'em to Atlanta, I tried to get one of the black schools [HBCUs] and I never was able to work out anything with them.  But I always wanted them on a college campus.  But and we also did, we used to do a week, now we do two weeks on the local, a campus somewhere in this vicinity.  And, you know, it's just been an absolutely fabulous program [Leadership Enrichment Arts Program].  And I, you know, I didn't foresee how far it was going, I was just doing it 'cause it needs to be done right now.  And I'm just, I am so thrilled.  I suppose of all of these hundred million things that I've done in my life that probably is the most important to me, is that program.  And I hope it'll keep going.  They're spending two weeks this summer at UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].  And I always had the, the College of Education to be their campus sponsor.  And I would bring in--and they're still doing a lot of that--speakers from all walks of life.  Luci Johnson [Luci Baines Johnson] was one of the ones used to come and speak to them every summer.  Just people from all walks of life, all colors.  And when we would have a meeting, this, now that's when they're staying on campus, but when we were having a meeting on campus which I tried to do with the presidents of all the local institutes of higher learning, and I would have the, ask the president to, to have a reception for them.  And then I would ask the president if he would send a, a resume so that my kids, one of my kids could introduce him.  And then ask questions and so on and they would have really nice food and stuff 'cause we didn't have any money (laughter).  And the opera [Austin Lyric Opera; Austin Opera] would provide, they provided me for a long time with a part time worker and since I don't do anything clerical, nothing, they provided me with some clerical help, things like that because everybody else got a computer.  Everybody else who has taken over since the- since I left was, they have computer skills and all of that stuff.
Story_ID: 620374
Speaker 1: I might add I knew the, the, the, the husband of the president of Junior League [Junior League of Austin, Austin, Texas] was serving with me on the board at, at, I was on the, I was trustee at the, at the art museum [Laguna Gloria Art Museum; Laguna Gloria, Austin, Texas].  And so her husband, and I knew her, so she, we were getting a really good reputation.  It was really convenient if you called up one and something says, you know, I'm a trustee at Austin Lyric Opera [Austin Opera], it opened all the doors.  Anyway, the wife was, was president of the Junior League and so she called me, she just volunteered, she, when my kids that first year that they were going to Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts], and she said, "Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson], what can we do?"  And I said, "Well, we've got the money for everything except transportation."  She said, "Well, you got it.  Make the reservation, send us the bill."  (Laughter) The mayor was a seatmate--and none of them had ever been on a plane before so all of that was new.  And the Austin [Texas] mayor was a seatmate for one of my kids.  (Laughter) And when we got to Boston [Massachusetts], one of, one of my kids strap broke in her, on her luggage and (laughter) tied up all the luggage for the whole time.  So they all had their pictures taken with, with, with, with the, with, with our mayor (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Who, who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and got to meet him, visit with him.
Speaker 2: Who was the mayor at the time?
Speaker 1: Roy Butler.  And the other thing was, I was, when I learned about the Wellesley program, it really was a little bit late to apply, especially for scholarship.  And when I called the, there was a, a husband and wife they started that, the program at Wellesley, and so we started talking and she said, "You know, Ada," the wife, she said, "You know, Ada, our philosophy of, the philosophy of LEAP [Leadership Enrichment Arts Program], and our philosophy is the same," and they couldn't wait for my kids to get there.
Speaker 2: We're, we're gonna stop right here and we'll pick up in just a second.
Speaker 1: I can't finish her statement (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry. Sure, yeah sure.
Speaker 1: So, Sandra [ph.] and, and her husband met us at the airport.  They, they sent somebody to meet 'em but I, and then I rode with, with Sandra and Lloyd [ph.].  And when we got to Wellesley they were waiting for us.  And the whole crew I had been talking to, they had this, you know, it was a long distance, much longer, well, at least as long as my lot or longer, they were waiting for us and when they saw us drive up, they all came running (laughter) out, so we've had this really good relationship with Wellesley, well with all the schools.  And my, the youngster that, the next year when we took them to, to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and they stayed at George Washington University, one of them who was really a little too young to go, he fell in love with George Washington and decided that's where he was going to school.  So the, he, one of my trustees on the LEAP board was a, a former attorney and a law professor at UT [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas] and he loved LEAP, he just thought that was the most wonderful program in the world.  And he had attended a prep school near Boston called Wilbraham and Monson [Wilbraham and Monson Academy, Wilbraham, Massachusetts].  He got them to give us full scholarship including transportation and they would have given it to more than one kid but our kids were not quite mature enough to leave Mama and Papa and so this one was in his senior year so he only got to spend one year.  But it was such a wonderful program and they took them around to visit this, well, they did that when, when the, with all the kids to visit the colleges, you know, they have a, so many colleges and universities around the Boston area.  And they took 'em as far as New York [New York] to visit colleges and universities.  Oh, I mean, it is just such tremendous exposure for our kids.

Speaker 1: So LEAP [Leadership Enrichment Arts Program] was, that was established in 1989?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Also you organized an exhibit (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the opera [Austin Lyric Opera; Austin Opera] was organized two years earlier.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about the exhibit at the Johnson Library, LBJ Library and Museum [Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  The, when the Laguna Gloria Art Museum [Laguna Gloria, Austin, Texas] raised money to build a new building, the, we had contracted 'cause I was on the, on the board then, we had contracted to have as part of our opening for our new building which was expected to be three years later, was, it wasn't (unclear), it was an African American, an exhibit of African American art. I'll tell you the name of the exhibit in a minute.  And this was a period when, anyway that was gonna, going to be part of our opening of the new museum building.  And the '80s [1980s] (laughter) got in the way.  At any rate we didn't get to build it.  So we had a contract and we didn't have any place to, to exhibit.  So we went to the LBJ Library and said, you know, how about (laughter) helping us out here and let's do this as a joint thing.  And they were delighted.  The, so the night of the opening of, of that exhibit, it was the Harlem Renaissance, Lady Bird Johnson stood at that door and shook every hand that went in at the reception.  And she said to me, and I always have to demonstrate (laughter) but she took her, took my hand in hers and held it like this and said, she usually called me Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson] but she said, "Mrs. Anderson, will you promise me that you will find another exhibit of equal importance?"  She said, "You know, Lyndon [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] always wanted this library and museum to be opened to African Americans in, and he, and he wanted them to come to this museum in large numbers in perpetuity."  And every time I would see her after that she would say, "You promised, you promised."  And this went on a long time, a number of years.
Story_ID: 620376
Speaker 1: And then I got the idea that this was a time when African Americans, at least not in this area, knew where to go to, to buy works of, of African American artists.  We weren't visible.  And we weren't in the museums, you know.  So, and to give you an example, Jennine [ph.] in, in, in, in, in my daughter's office, Sandra's [Sandra Anderson Baccus] office, she's painted several, some of these that I have here at my house. Sandra had her to, I think she did like thirty paintings, and brought them to the vineyard and The Links [The Links, Incorporated] had just had a meeting. Where was the meeting?  Anyway it was nearby 'cause everybody came to the vineyard afterwards.  And they bought everything she had.  And at the LBJ Library [Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, Austin, Texas] they had an exhibit, you see this dancer behind me?  And that, I'll tell you his name in a minute, he was from Colorado and one of my friends talked somebody from, from, from the LBJ Library to go see his works in Colorado and they came back and said, "Yeah, we want it."  So they exhibited it.  And African Americans bought every piece (laughter) that man brought.  He came back two or three times and they'd buy everything.  I had, and, and I bought two pieces still, he called her 'Lady in the Hat' [ph.] or something. You see the one in, in my living room and then this one behind me.  And I had, I had had an exhibit (laughter) for him here at my house at the, at the next trip and people just bought everything he had.  And he came back at least three times.  The, and he, because I, I had helped him a lot he gave me a number of pieces. They were not originals they were the, whatever, you call it.  So I have a number of this, his pieces and I've given a number of 'em away.
Story_ID: 620377
Speaker 1: So anyway and Lady Bird [Lady Bird Johnson] is still saying, you know, "You promised," so I got the idea that since, on this background that nobody knows where to go to find them, nobody black or white, I would try to get together contemporary artists, I don't mean contemporary artists, but living artists and--because whenever I would talk to, to white people about African American art they'd always talk about African art from Africa which is a totally different thing.  And so I, it had to be African American only and they had to be living.  And the, you saw the, the, the painting over my buffet in, in the, in the breakfast room, the, his protege, he would, he was Dr. Biggers [John T. Biggers], he was, he headed up the art department at Texas Southern University in Houston [Texas] and his assistant, his protege, was [HistoryMaker] Alvia Wardlaw, so I got the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] to get the services of Alvia to go and locate and to be the curator for the exhibit at, at the library [Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, Austin, Texas].  And so she got thirty-seven artists, living artists.  We didn't, (laughter) we never had much money, never had much money.  So anyway she, when we did the, the, the catalog, she had set it up so that each of them could do, have three paintings.  And but we only, every, all of the artists have just one painting each in that catalog, so.  And I think it's in the--no, it's not in the catalog, but Lady Bird had all the, the people, committee members that worked on it to pose with her and had pictures made, copies made to give to every one of the artists.  I thought having living artists it would, the prestige would help their careers, that was, that was my goal was to help those careers.  And the, in fact, I was so busy being hostess I didn't even get up there to get my picture (laughter).  I, but we got Lady Bird to give them a signed picture. We had her to give them one of her books, signed, one of Lyndon's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] books, signed (laughter) and Luci [Luci Baines Johnson] said, "My children don't even have," (laughter), "these."  They paid for their transportation and hotel.  As it (laughter), 'cause I had Lady Bird, Lady Bird's backing but I, I told you sometimes I wonder how do I think (laughter) I get the universities to do all these things.  But that was, that was a, that was real special.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the exhibit?
Speaker 1: 'Our New Day Begun' which is a, from James Weldon Johnson 'Lift Every Voice and Sing.'
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Which I thought was a pretty nice, and, and Alvia came up with that, with that title.  And this was when I, I had, had mentioned earlier that I realize where my, you know, where my interest in art really began, but I hadn't had an opportunity to see anything (laughter) much.  At, you know, at Laguna Gloria and we had John Biggers who's painting is, is over my buffet you saw there, the first pai- artist that we had exhibited for the Laguna Gloria Art Museum [Laguna Gloria, Austin, Texas].  We had been given at that time, we had been given space downtown in one of the savings and loan for a, a secondary site and so we had the exhibit, his exhibit there.  And at that time was the U.S. Treasurer Azie, Azie Taylor Morton was the U.S. treasurer under Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], the Carter administration.  So we invited her as a special guest to come and speak.  And then I, my friend and I got the, all the black organizations, sororities, fraternities, Links [The Links, Incorporated], Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], you name it, and the, to sponsor a, a bus to bus school children, we got permission from the school district so that they could be bused in.  And we had more people to see that exhibit than all of the rest exhibits for the year combined.  So that was, that was one of the events we did there.
Story_ID: 620378
Speaker 1: Tell me about the, the Long Center [Long Center for the Performing Arts, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: Did I tell you about the book signing (laughter) at, at the LBJ Library [Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, Austin, Texas]?  Oh, and by the way on, on the, the art exhibit ['Our New Day Begun'], (laughter) everybody I told, you know, a lot of, they had a lot of functions at, at UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] during the, the period before it, the event occurred.  And so (laughter) I, they had, somebody was being honored, I had no business on that program at all.  I just (laughter) walked up and they had about two hundred or so people, all of 'em white I think but me.  And so I asked if I could make an announcement, I made a speech.  And I told, told them they didn't know, (laughter) they didn't know anything about African American artists' work and that they needed to know and it was important that they know and it was important that they come to that exhibit.  (Laughter) They wanted to kill me.  But at any rate, (laughter) at any rate, the, the evening of the opening, I think they limited us to five hundred people. Would you believe we had fourteen hundred and something.  And Luci [Luci Baines Johnson] and I cut the ribbon.  (Laughter) Lady Bird [Lady Bird Johnson] had said, "Now, Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson]," (laughter), "you're gonna sit at my table."  And she and, and, that used to be her press, her press secretary, Liz, Liz Carpenter, "Liz and I are gonna have a table and you're gonna come," (laughter), "sit at our table," and I said, "Okay."  But, you know, I was being a hostess so she kept sending for me, she made me, she said, "And you don't have to worry about a thing, they'll bring us the food, they'll bring us," (laughter), "our wine."  And, but at any rate it was a biggie.  And the, and this was every day, they kept coming, they kept coming.
Story_ID: 620379
Speaker 1: When I did the book signing (laughter) over there, I had a thous- that's when, when Marquita [ph.] came. I told you we honored Marquita and Ruth Simmons who was then, had just been named, you know, I told you that story, she had just been named president of Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts] and she was from Houston [Texas] so her family all came.  And anyway, and the, for this book signing there was I think eighty women who had been honored, who, who, who had their stories in the book.  We, we invited all of them and their families to come to the book signing (laughter).  And I think eighty of them came.  And the next morning on the front page of the, the, I think we call it now life and arts, not life and arts, the local state, city and state section, they had this big picture, went all the way across on, in color, of Lady Bird [Lady Bird Johnson] and Luci [Luci Baines Johnson] standing in front with their awards and all of the other people on, you know, scattered (laughter)--
Speaker 2: The book signing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) behind.
Speaker 2: --well, what was the name of the book?
Speaker 1: 150 Years of Tri- Texas, 'African American Women of Texas: 150 Years of Trial and Triumph' [sic. 'Black Texas Women: 150 Years of Trial and Triumph,' Ruthe Winegarten]. I've got a copy in there, I'll show you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When they, and it was published by the University of Texas Press [Austin, Texas] and that's, that was the university connection (laughter).  And a lot of the women who had been honored in there were UT graduates so that was the way I made the, made the connection to sell the, sell the project to the university.
Story_ID: 620380
Speaker 1: Now, you're also on the university's, it's no longer the alumni, what is it called now?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's called Ex-Students [Ex-Students' Association of the University of Texas].
Speaker 1: And tell me about that 'cause you all were just honored not too long ago.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I've had a lot of, I've done a lot of things, involved in a lot of things over there.  The, this was distinguished alum and I guess that was three years ago now.  And you'll see all, they got, they just send you all kinds of stuff.  We saw the, the book of pictures but there's all other, all kind, all, they just keep sending you stuff (laughter).  The, they, prior to my being honored they had had, I think they'd only had two African Americans, I think it was, I can only think of two that had ever had that honor.  John Connally was one of 'em (laughter).  The, but now they have one a year.  They also have, they honor the young Texan and that's forty or, or younger.  And one of my cousins that was in, in Atlanta [Georgia] with me this, this past week was, was honored, had that honor.  And I served on the, the development board and now she's, she's following in my foot, footsteps except I never served as president of the alumni association.  Next time, of the Texas Exes, and she's the incoming president of the Texas Exes.  But she was honored as, as, you know, the young Texan and I served on the, the development board so now she's on the development board, so she's, she's picking up all, you know, right behind me.  The and I've been on the College of Education board for so long, nobody can remember, I don't think our records go back that far, (laughter) that far.  Through three deans (laughter) and this dean has been there twenty some years (laughter).  But I served on the, what we call the centennial commission, a hundred years, and that continued to meet for years after, once a year and sometimes twice and sometimes we worked twice a year for years.  And now, (laughter) just served on the a hundred and twenty-fifth (laughter) and the, that's the most recent honor.  And I've just got one of the booklets that (laughter) oh, it's another one of those 125 years.
Story_ID: 620381
Speaker 1: Of all the things that you have done, you talked about the opera [Austin Lyric Opera; Austin Opera] being one of the most important things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I didn't tell you about the Long Center [Long Center for the Performing Arts, Austin, Texas]. You wanna hear the Long Center what that is, and I can tell you that in a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a few sentences.
Speaker 1: The Long Center?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  The, Austin [Texas] did not own a, a performing arts facility venue.  And we had, we had to use the, the Blinn [ph.] at the, I don't mean the Blinn, but at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] and they needed theirs and they told us it's really time for us to get on (laughter) and go get our own as, you know, as for the city.  And they let us stay on an additional three years while we were trying to, trying to, trying to make it.  And so we were just built a new center and it's called the Long Center.  The, the first, first gift that we got was a $20 million gift from one of our board members, Joe, Joe Long [Joe R. Long] and his wife [Teresa Lozano Long].  No wonder it's called the Long Center, right?  And so (laughter) I kept, I kept, I kept making these speeches saying I had been on the board for fifteen years and they said, "Ada [HistoryMaker Ada Anderson], it's only ten."  I said, "It feels like fifteen.  We've been raising money all that time and I'm not a money raiser" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I felt so strongly that how much we needed it, and so now we, we've been open now two years.  And now I have gone as emeritus, thank you very much, I said, "Now you're open, done."
Story_ID: 620382
Speaker 1: But there's something fascinating about the Long Center [Long Center for the Performing Arts, Austin, Texas] is that it was called the Palmer Auditorium [Lester E. Palmer Auditorium] which was the only place we had to have anything and it was kind of a, a barn like facility.  And it was named for one of our former mayors, Lester Palmer [Lester E. Palmer].  The, this was where Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was going to speak, everything that happened in Austin [Texas] was there and he got, he got killed in Dallas [Texas] before he got here.  And the, so the, first of all they built another facility on the same grounds and named it the Palmer Events Center [Austin, Texas].  And then we took the, the old Palmer Auditorium.  And I think we had something about nineteen acres of land or something, right on Lady Bird Lake.  And they actually tore it down essentially and used 90 something percent, reused 97, 90 something percent in the new facility.  It is a unique design, you, you never have seen and never will see another one exactly like it, it's, but it's wonderful.  For example, one of the kind of fun things that that I like to tell people about, it had a, a multicolored roof, it was round in shape.  It had a multicolored roof, shades of green, real pretty.  They used that, it was metal, and they used that to, to put it sideways in the elevators in the new facility.  They had, it was the, stage was, you know, yea high, they dug that out, lowered the stage, I think ten feet, so that you can get this shape (laughter) for the seats.  It has, took the, the granite, and it was real granite, thick granite, that were in the restrooms and they're in the current restrooms.  The, just all kinds of innovative ways that they did it.  And we have, have one venue that houses twenty-five hundred people which is supposed to be ideal for the opera [Austin Lyric Opera; Austin Opera], symphony [Austin Symphony Orchestra], and ballet [Ballet Austin], so it's the home for all three of those.  And it's just really a, a very, very neat place.  And what was the original, it was cement floor, round, most of that is, you know, just open for another venue open as a, as a veranda, where they have all kinds of functions, dances.  Austin's a big music, music place and so there's always some music out there.  Music for all kinds of events.  So we have it and it's fully paid for.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: We just have to raise enough money to keep it running (laughter).  And the city didn't contribute anything except let us lease the land for a dollar a year. We got a fifty year lease on it.  Our cheap city didn't do anything. We had to raise all of that money.
Story_ID: 620383
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you would like to do that you have not done?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't think so.  Nothing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --comes to, just let me put it this way, nothing comes to mind (laughter).
Speaker 1: What do you want people to say about you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm gonna give, you know, kind of a silly answer but it's just whatever they choose (laughter).
Story_ID: 620384
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I really think probably the most important thing that I've ever done is the, the LEAP program [Leadership Enrichment Arts Program] because I just have always liked crazy teenagers (laughter).  And I just think that they, you know, it's the, and the other thing is I know what arts will do for, for young people in developing their minds, their creativity.  This is one story that relates to that that I'd like to share.  The, I have a friend who has a Ph.D. in art history from the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], she also, she paints, she's written a number of books, and she (laughter) is currently with the Austin Independent School District.  And she got a couple of her parents who were, knew how to videotape and were interested in the arts and, and she invited me to be on her, on her committee but she and the two parents went and interviewed the, the, what do you call it?  That hires the people (laughter) for Dell computer [Dell Inc.] and IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and there's another one, they went to three.  And they interviewed them and asked them, and videotaped it, and asked, what they really looked for in a new employee.  And you would have thought that they all had, had sat down and agreed on what they were going to say.  Some, they all sound just alike.  "Creativity, take as much--." "What is your advice?"  "Take as much art as you can, whether it's, it can be choral music, it can be dance, it can be the visual arts, it can be the, you know, any of the performing arts, any kind of art work," they went on.  And I've, I have a lot of statistics that I already had researched, Sandra's [Anderson's daughter, Sandra Anderson Baccus] researched a lot of it too, of what it does to, to the brain.  And the, what we do is to kill that creativity, and soon as we have a, a short fall in the, in the, you know, downturn in the economy the first thing we get rid of is PE [physical education] and, and, and music, PE and, and, and the arts, all of the arts.  And so I just know the importance of it.  Anyway she took these, she was, wanted to convince our local superintendent and she wanted to convince her, her principal, who was not at all convinced, and she invited me to go with 'em when they made the presentation to the superintendent and she had invited, invited her principal to come along.  And, you know, made the presentation.  The superintendent was sold, it look a little bit longer to, to sell the, the principal believe it or not.  The Gates, what is it, Melinda [Melinda Gates] and, what's Gates' other name [Bill Gates]?  You know, who I'm talking about of Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation].  And he says that what he would look for in an employee is somebody young, he said, "I don't care whether they finish high school, if they have just had enough art and had enough creativity," he said, "that's all I need."  You got to be able to dream.
Story_ID: 620385
Speaker 1: And so I've been, as I said, I've been thoroughly convinced.  There's one other program that I read about in Harlem [New York, New York], the and this was some time ago, but they had somebody, some man, organized a program on Saturday mornings for eleven and twelve year old African American boys and they wrote poetry. That's all they did.  And all of those kids stayed in school, all of those kids went on to college, all of those kids did well.  So I'm a firm believer that in investing in young people and giving them some reason to dream.  We were able to get, and there are, there are so many scholarships available, if people will just research it.  I had one of my students who was about to drop out of school, when, when we took her in and she was one of the first ones to go to Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts], she came back, as a new person.  When she graduated she got a four year scholarship with everything paid and thirteen other scholarships locally.  She went four year college and they even paid for her transportation and all her mother had to do was, was clothes.  We were able to get a number of our kids in the, well a, a Episcopal prep school in Austin [Texas].  And we were able to get a number of them, one of them, mother was on food stamps, and then she went on with a big scholarship to a university in San Antonio [Texas].  But there are just story after story after story I can tell you.  So it's just worth it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  We're gonna stop here.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Go ahead if you want to say thank you or whatever.
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to thank you for taking the time. I know we took up a lot of your time and we really appreciate you telling us your story for The HistoryMaker archive.
