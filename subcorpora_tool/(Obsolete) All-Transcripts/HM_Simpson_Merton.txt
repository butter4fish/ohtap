Speaker 2: I don't know that I have one, you know.  And I can think of one, but I don't think I have a favorite.  It depends on the moment kind of, you know.
Story_ID: 300241
Speaker 1: Okay, so we'll start.  And we will talk about your mother's side of the family first, and then we'll talk about your father's [Marion Simpson] side separately.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then we'll talk about your childhood and your grandparents.  So, can you tell me your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Jennie Gibson [Simpson].
Speaker 1: And her date of birth?
Speaker 2: You know, offhand I don't know, but like I said, (unclear).
Speaker 1: And your mother's place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in South Carolina, in Charleston.
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of your mother?
Speaker 2: A too good person, you know.  You'd give her a present, you know, for Christmas, and five years later you'd see it on the neighbor, because she thought the neighbor needed it more than she did.  She was just too generous, to a fault, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, where did your mother grow up?
Speaker 2: Well, she grew up in Charleston, you know, and (unclear) but Charleston was the place.
Speaker 1: So do you remember anything about your mother's background?  Did she tell you any stories about her life as a child growing up?
Speaker 2: Not that much, not really, no.
Speaker 1: Now, your mother must have been--in Charleston, did you live in rural Charleston or did you live in sort of the city?
Speaker 2: In the city.  You know, Charleston, you know was very mixed, you know.  You'd have a big white family here, and nine blocks down the street there's another black family, you know.  So, it was not racially divided as such, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother have the opportunity to go to school in Charleston?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She never went to college, but you know, everyone else did.  She was just a great homemaker, you know, took care of her kids.
Speaker 1: And how many children did your mother have?
Speaker 2: Actually nine, one died.  So, we'll say eight.  Patsy [Simpson Johnson] and Peggy [ph.] were twins, and Patsy lived and Peggy died after maybe a year or so, you know.
Speaker 1: So, what are some of your fondest memories of your mother?
Speaker 2: Her generosity and love of her family, and being good to her neighbors, you know, just being a decent human being, you know.
Speaker 1: What was your mother's background?
Speaker 2: Well, I think--my grandmother was Maggie Gibson [Margie Gibson], you know.  And she loved her family, and my mother was just following in her footsteps, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, your grandmother, Maggie Gibson, was she--do you know her date of birth by chance?
Speaker 2: No, no, really I don't.
Speaker 1: Now, was she born in Charleston as well?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't swear to it, you know.
Speaker 1: So what do you remember about your grandmother, Maggie?
Speaker 2: Again, she was just a generous lady, and she worked a lot.  She worked until she was quite elderly, you know.  And she was, she was working for the major families in Charleston on the waterfront, you know.  And she was well-liked.  And so whenever there was a big family for catering, they'd call on Maggie, because she could, she knew what to do with the order, and that kind of thing, you know.  So, she was much respected and appreciated, you know.
Speaker 1: So, when you think about your mother and your grandmother, their generosity is one of the things that come to mind.  What else comes to mind when you think about those women in your family?
Speaker 2: Well, they were concerned about the race and such.  But being good people, and not being someone that's frowned upon, you know--just being a decent human being, you know, simple as that, you know.
Speaker 1: What were their concerns about the race?  You said they were concerned about the race.
Speaker 2: Well, she wanted to protect her kids from having any problems with the racial injustice that went through the country at the time.  But--
Speaker 1: What did she tell you and the children about race when you were children?
Speaker 2: To be the best that you can and do the best that you can, and people will respect you, no matter what color you are, you know.
Speaker 1: Now was Charleston legally segregated, or was it not?  You said there were black families and white families (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, it was segregated, but as much as most of the South, you know.  Charleston was a pretty special place, you know.  I remember a man by the name of Edward Johnson [ph.] who had a woodworking shop, and he was next to The Post and Courier newspaper.  And he worked for all the major families.  And from time to time on the weekend, I would help him work on some of the old furniture and then refinish it.  And he was considered to be just another person, you know, Edward Johnson, you know.
Speaker 1: What was the name of his woodshop?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just Johnson's Workshop, and it was next to The Post and Courier newspaper, we know that, you know.  And he did the staining of chairs and scrubbing down the old furniture to refinish them.  And I used to help him scrub them down to make extra money, you know.  Because when I was selling papers, I used to love to take money home to the family, you know.  I did that, so, you know.
Story_ID: 300242
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your father's side of the family.  What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: Marion [Simpson], and his mother came and lived upstate for a long time, I think in New York [New York], actually.  And she came to Charleston [South Carolina] rather late, and actually lived in Charleston about three or four years, you know.  But she used to always travel back and forth from North Carolina to New York State, you know.
Speaker 1: Now does that mean your father was born in New York State, or was your father born in Charleston?
Speaker 2: He was born in South Carolina, you know.  I believe it was South Carolina, Charleston, I believe, you know.
Speaker 1: What are some of your earliest memories of your father?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a city water man.  He used to go around and check the water meters in the streets.  And he used to ride a bicycle, and he was--and for Charleston at the time, that was a major job, being a water meter man, checking the meter, you know.  And he did that for I guess at least forty years or so.  And he had a problem with glaucoma, and he died actually from glaucoma, you know.
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Simpson [HistoryMaker Merton Simpson], have you ever traced your heritage, your ancestors?
Speaker 2: No, I never did, but I have a cousin who did something recently.  I haven't read the article yet, but there was an article in the newspaper in Charleston about what she did and what she found, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, what have you heard about what she found?  Have you heard anything about what she's found?
Speaker 2: Not enough.  You know, because they'd all be talking and I'd be in Paris [France], so I'd miss all of that, you know.
Speaker 1: So, do you remember your father's parents?  I know you said his mother lived upstate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I met them, but no one else, I don't remember that, you know.
Story_ID: 300243
Speaker 1: So, what are your earliest memories of your own childhood?  What do you remember about growing up in Charleston, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember that most of the time I didn't do much.  I didn't learn to swim, because I had this problem with my legs, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What problem did you have with your legs?
Speaker 2: I had trouble walking, you know, and that was from the diphtheria and the rheumatic fever and all that at the same time.  And when I had diphtheria, there was no cure for it, you know.  So, you had to be treated by your own family more or less.  That's because it was very expensive, maybe, you know.  But what I remember on the weekend I'd be painting on the weekend on my porch.  You know, I'd set up an easel and I'd paint, you know, and that's what I did, you know.
Story_ID: 300244
Speaker 1: But before you came to painting, when you were really small, what do you remember about Charleston [South Carolina]?  Did you grow up--let's talk about the neighborhood you grew up in.  You grew up in--what did it look like?
Speaker 2: In the projects, you know.  There were public projects, and we had for many years lived in the projects, you know.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the projects?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: No, not really, you know.  But the main thing I remember being a child was the Jenkins Orphanage [Daniel Joseph Jenkins Institute for Children, Charleston, South Carolina], because I always wanted to play in that band, because the music was there, and that's where you learned to play the music, you know.  And as soon as I was old enough I was able to, you know, I went and sort of helped the kids, tutoring a bit, you know.  And we got paid by music lessons, and that was the great thing about that.
Speaker 1: So before we move forward, you said you grew up in the projects?
Speaker 2: Yes, and--
Speaker 1: And how--and I'm asking you to reflect back on it, but what are some of the cultural things you remember about growing up in that section of Charleston at that time?  What were the foods you ate?  What were some of the toys you played with?  Like, if you, like artifacts--if I were trying to discover as much as I could about Charleston and its projects in that period, what would be important for me to know about?
Speaker 2: Well, kids made their toys.  They made the skate mobiles, you know, and that kind of stuff.  And the wagons would have extra wheels that you could push with one foot, and that kind of thing, you know.  And we lived for a long time next to a funeral home, you know, the Fielding Funeral Home [Charleston, South Carolina], you know.  And I remember at Christmastime the drivers for the funeral home would take the kids around in the car and see the windows with their toys.  I remember that very vividly, you know.  And they were all willing to do that for the kids, you know, a philanthropic kind of approach, you know.
Speaker 1: What were Christmases like at your home?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a good time, you know, a lot of food.  And I like I said, the toys, we made our toys kind of.  It was just a time for giving, you know.  Like, we'd give my mother [Jennie Gibson Simpson] a coat, and six months later the neighbor would have the coat, that kind of thing, you know.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, we'll continue.  So, do you remember what foods you had over the Christmas holidays?  What was cooked?
Speaker 1: Well, it was always turkey and that kind of stuff, dumplings, and a lot of greens and things, but a lot of seafood also.  Because Charleston was on the waterfront, and everybody fished, you know.  I had an uncle who fished and would bring fish down on the weekend, you know.
Story_ID: 300245
Speaker 1: So, do you remember when you first got sick as a little boy with diphtheria?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, no.  I remember being sick, but I don't remember when I got sick, I don't remember that.  Because I didn't consider it being sick.  I guess I had a problem getting around, but that was just a stage in my life, you know.  I never considered it a problem as such, you know.
Speaker 1: When were you allowed to go to school?
Speaker 2: I'd say roughly second grade, but I never pinpointed that, you know.  And I, because I enjoyed being home painting.  That was what I loved, you know, I loved doing that, you know.  I used to do cartoons, you know, that kind of thing, you know.
Speaker 1: You did cartoons from?
Speaker 2: From the funny papers, the newspapers, you know.
Speaker 1: So, if you, what were your earliest paintings about?  How did you discover painting?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm trying to think, now.  Well, I first fell in love with a painting by the name of Albert [Pinkham] Ryder, you know.  He was a landscape painter and he did these very moody kind of storm cloud pictures, you know.  And actually for many years I painted some Ryders, you know, without realizing it, you know.  In fact once there was a show up in, I think at some museum up in New York City [New York, New York].  And the painting was a good painting, and they said it should be first prize, except it was too much like Ryder, you know.  But I'd never seen Ryder as such, you know, but it had the mood of a Ryder painting.  And finally, they finally gave me the prize, you know.  And I think at the time, Romare [Bearden] was one of the judges.
Speaker 1: So do you remember starting school say around, between the third and the fifth grades?
Speaker 2: Roughly that, yeah.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't think I was brilliant, but I always passed, you know.  But I was always doing other things, extra stuff they'd do on the bulletin board, you know.  The Christmas scene, I know we had a Christmas scene that I did I guess in the fifth or sixth grade, and they kept that up until about eighth grade, because we'd roll it up on paper and they'd use it around.  And my homeroom teacher at the time was Miss Spencer [ph.], and she loved that project that I did, you know, the Three Wise Men, you know.  There was always one prevalent black guy there, the Three Wise Men, you know.
Speaker 1: What did you think about, did you have any feelings about that as a child, that the three kings that you were painting, that there was one black and two whites?
Speaker 2: Not really.  You know, for some reason, they just wanted to do that; I think they should do that, you know.  But the interesting thing as a child, well not really as a child, I think I was about seventeen years old.  And a lady by the name of Anita Pollack [ph.] came to Charleston [South Carolina] and she saw my work accidentally, I guess, you know.  And she said to me, "You don't belong to Charleston, you belong to the world."  You know, and saying that to a seventeen year old at the time, you know.  And we ended up getting a show down on Broad Street in Charleston.  And in that show we had three openings--one for blacks, one for whites, and one for blacks and whites who wanted to be together, you know.  And there was some big stink about having the show, they thought there would be a problem.  But there was one lady by the name of Laura Bragg, you know, and she was the money bag in Charleston.  And she said, "We're going to have this show, and we're going to have the opening.  And anybody who wants to come, let them come, you know."  And the show went on, and it was no problem, you know.
Story_ID: 300246
Speaker 1: When you think back over your early years, what sort of sights, sounds, or smells remind you of your childhood in Charleston [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked the waterfront, you know.  I liked the boats, you know.  And I guess one of my reasons for liking that, is I liked to go down there and just see the fishermen working, and the splashings on the seashore kind of.  And I was able to go.  I loved the water, and I definitely remember being there on the waterfront, you know.
Story_ID: 300247
Speaker 1: Well, you were born in '28 [1928], so that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was right in the midst of the [Great] Depression.
Speaker 2: The Depression, yeah.  But I didn't realize it; I couldn't tell you anything about the Depression.  I heard about it in hindsight kind of, you know.  But we were never starving, you know.  We weren't rich, but we always got along, and we were never hungry.  And you know, we always shared with our neighbors kind of, you know.
Speaker 1: So, do you remember when you were growing if there were any sort of community leaders in the neighborhood?  Were there people that you looked up to in the neighborhood for any one reason or another?
Speaker 2: Oh, let me think.  Well, I had people in my family, Aunt Routhe [Routhe Gibson], who was a lady who sang a lot, you know.  She was a schoolteacher and she traveled all up to the state colleges around Charleston [South Carolina] and stuff like that, you know.  And then there was an uncle whose name was Miller [Miller Gibson, Jr.], but we called him Mooch, you know.  He would take us to the circus every year, that was his ritual, you know.  He would come and take all of us, six, seven, or eight kids, and he would take us to the big circus.  And we looked forward to that, you know.  He was a very kind man, you know.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of that circus, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I believe it was Ringling Brothers [Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey]; I think it was Ringling, you know.
Speaker 1: Because I know during that time they had minstrel shows.
Speaker 2: Minstrel shows, yes.  And I used to go once in a while, you know.  As a matter of fact, when we traveled in the summer with the jazz group from Jenkins Orphanage [Daniel Joseph Jenkins Institute for Children, Charleston, South Carolina], we used to go to Titusville, Virginia where they'd have these sort of sideshows and all kinds of things going on.  But we played, you know, and I'd drag a painting along and I was kind of winning the little prizes they had, you know. So, I could get maybe twenty-five dollars and a ribbon, you know.  I looked forward to that at the time, you know.
Speaker 1: So you were at home and you were kind of a sick child.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Who gave you--
Speaker 2: But I didn't suffer, you know, I just had a problem running around.  And I never learned to swim because my mother [Jennie Gibson Simpson] was afraid that going into the water handicapped was not a thing to do, you know.  And I think if you don't learn to swim as a kid, you don't learn to swim.  As an adult, you become afraid of the water, I guess, you know.
Story_ID: 300248
Speaker 1: So, who gave you the first paint and brushes, and helped you become a painter when you were that child?  And how did painting start?  You were looking at the comic strips?
Speaker 2: The comic strips, yes.  And I'm sure the family got together and bought me a paint set, you know.  I don't remember exactly when, you know.  But I remember at some point we used to have white paint, and I couldn't buy.  So we'd get sometimes an old toothbrush and buy toothpaste and put a binder in it and use that as a paint canvas, and it worked for the moment, you know.  But I always had the good luck of running into good people.  There was one lady by the name of Jean Flemings [ph.].  She was a portrait painter, and she lived in the People's Building in Charleston [South Carolina], which was down in the rich part of the city.  And Edward Johnson [ph.] had a frame shop that I worked in for a little while, and he introduced me to Jean Flemings, and she had me sit for a portrait.  And she said she could show me something about the technique, and she did the painting.  And strangely enough, that painting turned up about six weeks ago, very badly damaged.  So I had it sent to me, and I'm going to have it restored, and probably give it to the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], you know.   But she gave me my first lesson in portrait painting by painting--I was sitting in as a model, yeah.  That was a good way to do it, you know.  And that's the kind of thing I remember most about Charleston, you know.  And she was in the People's Building, you know, a major building on Broad Street in Charleston, right near city hall, you know.  I don't know whether Mia [ph.] mentioned to you, but in the city hall in Charleston, there was a portrait of Reverend Jenkins [Daniel J. Jenkins] who started the art thing for the jazz group.  And he was a black man being honored by black artists, so I did the portrait.  And they hung the portrait right across from John C. Calhoun, that big racist guy, and that's where it hangs today in Charleston, you know.  There's a photograph of it in the file there, of Reverend Jenkins.  He was a brilliant man, you know.
Story_ID: 300249
Speaker 1: What year, do you remember what year you went to, you started high school?  Because I know high school is (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Not offhand, no.  But I caught up, you know, eventually.
Speaker 1: Well, in high school is when I read that you started to meet people that would help you with your art.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had Mrs. Fleming [Jean Fleming (ph.)]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then you got--talk to me about the transition from the paper route.  You had a paper route that led you to meet someone else?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, like I said, Halsey [William Halsey] had a studio downtown.
Speaker 1: You used to deliver his papers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then there was Cora Kulag [ph.], she was a Russian lady who had a bookshop, you know.  And that's actually where I had my first show, in that bookshop in Charleston [South Carolina], you know.  And she was very close to Billy Halsey, and he was the guy who helped me the most with the painting, you know.
Speaker 1: So, you graduated from high school and you decided to move to New York [New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, uh-huh, uh-huh--
Speaker 1: And you went to Cooper [The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Cooper, yes.  Actually I came up for the Cooper test, and I missed the test because I didn't know anything about trigonometry.  But then I got a partial scholarship with NYU [New York University, New York, New York] with Woodruff, you know, Hale Woodruff, you know.  In the following year I took the test again, and for a year and a half I went to Cooper at night and NYU in the day.  And then finally in '51 [1951], I went into the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: So, in 1951 you were drafted into the Air Force?
Speaker 2: I volunteered.
Speaker 1: You volunteered?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and actually in my first week on the base I did a portrait of Lieutenant Seals [ph.], one of the base commanders.  And after that, I was supposed to be going to Korea, you know.  And the guy said to me, you know, "You're a musician and you're an artist.  What are you going to Korea for?"  I said, "I go wherever you send me, you know."  And they kept me on the base and I played cocktail parties for the officers, and did portraits.  I did General [Nathan Farragut] Twining, I did General [Robert Wells] Harper; I did several of the generals, you know.
Speaker 1: Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower]?
Speaker 2: Eisenhower I did, yes.
Speaker 1: What was it like when you painted Eisenhower?
Speaker 2: Well, I--
Speaker 1: Because he paid you a hundred bucks, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  But the fun thing was, you know, Twining, I did his portrait, and when he retired he wrote me and said, "I love the portrait you did, but what I like very much also is that you made a frame for it."  I carved a frame for it, and he reminded me about that, you know.  I think I have a photograph of some of those, you know.
Speaker 1: So, what was military life like?  What did that entail for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have a military life.  Right away, they put me in special services, you know, so I was painting portraits and playing jazz, that's all I did.  I did nothing for the [U.S.] military, you know.  But it kept the generals happy, so it was okay, you know.  And every now and again, I'd have what they call a freedom trip, and I'd fly from Cheyenne, Wyoming, where I was based, to come to New York to accept certain ribbons.  Because the ribbons had to be the right colors, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) One second, one second. We're going to just let this pass.
Speaker 2: --and they, they had, getting those colors right, you know.  But I really had a good time in the Air Force, you know, good time.
Story_ID: 300250
Speaker 1: Okay, you were telling me about--let's just start again with the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 2: The Air Force, yeah.
Speaker 1: You enlisted in 1951?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I stayed until 1953 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why did you enlist?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Why did you enlist?  Because you'd been accepted at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], and you were on a partial scholarship.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, eventually I would have been drafted, you know.  So, I just thought it was time for me to do it, you know, so I could sort of pick my places, you know.  And I wanted to go into the band.  I wanted to try to do the band and the art, and that's all I did, you know.
Speaker 1: At the time you went into the Air Force, did you consider yourself somewhat of a talented artist?  Did you have a knack for painting?
Speaker 2: Well, I enjoyed my painting, and I knew I had some talent, you know.  I don't want to say I was a genius or anything like that, but I knew what I was doing, you know.
Speaker 1: So in 1951, you enlisted into the Air Force.
Speaker 2: The Air Force, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Where did you go, where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I went to Cheyenne, Wyoming.  And I went upstate first of all, and then I was sent to Cheyenne, Wyoming where I got basic training.  And after that, I was assigned to do the portraits, you know.  Like I said, [General Nathan Farragut] Twining, [General Robert Wells] Harper and all these other people.
Speaker 1: Well, were the other musicians African American?
Speaker 2: Oh, at the base, yeah.
Speaker 1: At the base?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They were black also?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Most of the guys in the band were black except one or two, you know.
Speaker 1: And were there any other black portrait painters?
Speaker 2: Not on the base, no, I was the only one at the time.  I was the only portrait painter on the base, actually that they called a portrait painter, you know.
Speaker 1: So, at that time the [U.S.] Army was legally segregated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the Air Force wasn't.
Speaker 1: So, in the Air Force you could go into the officer's club and--
Speaker 2: Well, if your rank was all right, yeah.
Speaker 1: If your rank--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But there was no racial separation, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, you had the opportunity to play for a lot of these parties.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: So what were those, what was the atmosphere like?  How were you treated?
Speaker 2: Oh, fine, you know.  They respected musicians, you know.  One or two of the black officers would be there, you know, in the Air Force that is, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, what did you play?  I know you--saxophone?
Speaker 2: Saxophone.  And we played jazz, you know, that was it.
Speaker 1: Now where did you learn to play tenor saxophone?
Speaker 2: At Jenkins Orphanage [Daniel Joseph Jenkins Institute for Children] in Charleston [South Carolina]; that was the place, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, this orphanage was a place for orphans, but you wanted to be--
Speaker 2: I volunteered my services to get the lessons.  That was a music school, you know, and I guess they had so many guys that came out of that school, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of music had you grown up listening to, big band?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  [Count] Basie, Duke [Ellington] and that kind of stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you have any musicians that you wanted to emulate at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked, I guess for music I liked Coleman Hawkins of course.  But my favorite was Ben Webster, and I finally met Ben, you know, in New York [New York].  And I would run into him in Europe, you know.  He played a lot in England at the time, in Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club [London, England].  And Bennie loved to cook, you know.  But he--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.  He was--
Speaker 2: He was really a great saxophonist.  And people talk about Coleman Hawkins, but Ben was the master, you know, he was the master.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Billy Taylor also played with Ben Webster.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Billy's still around, he's still around, yes, you know.

Speaker 1: So when you--you're in the [U.S.] Air Force--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and you're a portrait painter and a jazz musician.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And they asked you to stay in, and you chose to leave because your mother [Jennie Gibson Simpson] was sick.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's when I did the thing with General [Nathan Farragut] Twining, and they were giving me a promotion.
Speaker 1: That's when you did what?
Speaker 2: They gave me a promotion.  And I could have become a lieutenant and go home; I said it would be better if I go home.  Two years later, I was processed and went out, you know.
Speaker 1: So, once you got out of the [U.S.] Army [sic.], you went back to Charleston [South Carolina] to take care of your mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And at what point did you come back to New York [New York] to complete your studies?  What year?
Speaker 2: Oh, it must have been about two years after that, you know, about '54 [1954] or '55 [1955], you know.  But you know, it was an exciting place at the time, because jazz was full steam ahead in New York at the time, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know there was the renaissance taking place in Harlem [New York, New York], or had that taken place in Harlem when you came back in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I was never in the renaissance, but I knew of it, you know.  Because actually I met Romare [Bearden] and all these other people--Romare Bearden, Norman Lewis, and Ernest Crichlow, who just passed.  But Norman was a whiz, you know, but he was not as popular as Romare.  'Cause Norman was, if he liked you, you knew that.  If he didn't, you knew that also.  But he was really an artist, you know.
Story_ID: 300252
Speaker 1: You'd mentioned Norman Lewis--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I was going to have you just talk about when--the year you met him, and then the impact, your friendship, the--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, he was one of the mainstays of the Spiral group, you know, that started.  And he was a very intense man, you know, and very concerned about the better things in life, you know, especially the arts, you know.  I remember when they had the program at the Metropolitan [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] about showing black artists, he was one of the main guys in the picket line, you know, with his--picketing.  And a lot of people didn't want to do it, you know.  Romi [Romare Bearden] did it, you know.  And loving these people, I got in line with them, you know sort of, you know.  And it did open up the place; they did take a few people in at the Met, (unclear), you know.
Speaker 1: What were you protesting at the Met, and what year was this (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were no black artists being exposed there, you know, almost nil, you know, and--but that did a lot because you know, that was during the Civil Rights Movement at the time, you know, and it affected so many things, you know.  But like I said, Norman was one of the ringleaders, you know.  Not only did he march, but he marched and he was chanting, you know, "Stay away from this museum."  And he stopped people from going in.  He stopped them, you know, the politicians, they were going, (unclear) the picket line.  And I think about six months after that, they got a couple of artists exposed there, you know.  At one point I was in a group show; I didn't win a prize, but I got an honorable mention, you know.  And it was the first pastel I ever did, you know.  And we sold it during the show in August recently, sold it to a man on Wall Street, you know.
Story_ID: 300253
Speaker 1: So, the Spiral group was founded around the time you met Norman Lewis?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the Spiral group and its members (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we wanted to see whether there was such a thing as black art.  And that's what we were talking about, you know.  And we finally decided after two or three or four years--
Speaker 1: But just tell me?  Was it a collective of black artists that got together to want to see if they had a common thread?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, tell me how that came to be.  Whose idea was it to bring you guys together?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but Romare [Bearden] was a certainly a major part of that.  Norman would have been, and Hale [Woodruff] would have been, you know.  Because Romare used to have sketch sessions at his studio on 125th Street [New York, New York].  We'd go up and we'd talk and chit-chat and sketch from a model, you know.  Anything that went on with the arts, Norman would be a part of it, you know.  But it had to be something serious, otherwise he wouldn't be there, you know.  But he was not one for small talk; he was about doing something for the arts.  He had some work at this place called the Woodard Gallery, and--
Speaker 1: Woodard Gallery?
Speaker 2: Willard, W-I-L-L-A-R-D [Willard Gallery, New York, New York].  And they didn't push his work because there was a white artist by the name of Tobey [Mark Tobey], and the work was so similar, they didn't want to push both artists, so they pushed Tobey.  And people wanted Norman to leave, but he wouldn't do it.  He would just, you know, he had a contract and he entertained that contract, you know.  But now, you can buy Tobey for two thousand dollars and you can buy Norman that cost for forty thousand dollars, you know.  There's a difference--the way things changed you know.
Speaker 1: So the Spiral group was founded, and it was you, there's Norman Lewis--
Speaker 2: Norman Lewis, and Charles Alston, Al Hollingsworth [Alvin Hollingsworth]; [Ernest] Crichlow was not a part of that.  But there was William A. Hughes and a couple of other artists that I can't recall at the moment, you know.  But the mainstays were Woodruff, Spinky [Charles Alston], Romare, Hollingsworth, and myself.  I had a little workshop downtown and we used to have meetings from time to time there, you know.  And we did have one show, a black and white show, you know.  And actually that's where Norman actually started doing a lot of pictures that were sold, and they had big prices, you know.  One of the things that he sold to Spike Lee was, 'Harlem Turns White', you know.  And it was a painting, Spike bought it, bought it for big money, above a hundred grand, you know.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Norman didn't get that (laughter).
Story_ID: 300254
Speaker 1: During the days of the collective, the Spiral group, can you remember some of the things you guys spoke about in the meetings, whether or not there was such a thing as black art?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And we decided after, you know, a year or so that it wasn't--
Speaker 1: So you decided that there wasn't, but what conversations did you have that led you to believe that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, there were all kinds of things going back and forth, back and forth.  But I don't remember any specific thing.  But we finally decided definitely that there was no such thing, you know.
Speaker 1: And there is no such thing as black art because?
Speaker 2: Because you're an artist, you're a human being, and you paint.  And that's it, you know.  You happen to be black, and that's--
Speaker 1: But wouldn't you say that there is such a thing--what is the difference between saying something is black art versus African art?  Because after the Spiral group, you took this trip to Paris [France] and you discovered--you became interested in the origins of African art.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: So, is African art black art?
Speaker 2: Well, you can say that if you want, you know.
Speaker 1: I know, I'm asking, I'm not--
Speaker 2: Well, I never thought about it that way.  I mean art is art, and it's still that to me, you know.  But if you're an African, you know. But there are a few white women in Africa, and they're painting.  In fact, one of my best friends is a Lebanese guy who lives in Brussels [Belgium] now, and I think he's one of the major art dealers in the world.  And there's a lot of prejudice against him, just because he's Lebanese.  But he has the best pieces and good taste, you know.  And people are complaining that I should stay away from this guy because of this and because of that.  The only reason they want me to stay away is because he's Lebanese, and there's still that racial thing going on, you know, even today, you know.  But he has a great heart and he really knows what he's doing, you know.  Sammy Borou [ph.] is the man's name.
Speaker 1: So when you, during the collective, the Spiral group, when you decided that there is no such thing as black art?
Speaker 2: Black art, yeah.
Speaker 1: What happened to the group after that?
Speaker 2: Oh, they sort of went their separate ways.  Most of the guys who stayed around New York [New York], we'd see each other from time to time, you know.  Before [Alvin] Hollingsworth died, which was about three years ago, I used to see him pretty frequently, you know.  And when Romare [Bearden] was around, we'd have dinner two or three times a week.  He loved Chinese food, so we'd have a Chinese meal, you know.  Norman [Lewis] didn't socialize that much.  Once in a while he may go to a jazz club, but he wasn't one for chit-chat, you know.  He was all serious stuff, you know.
Story_ID: 300255
Speaker 1: During the time that you were--in 1954 when during the time of Brown v. Board of Ed [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], you became the first black artist to exhibit in the Guggenheim Museum [Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: (Unclear) But I didn't know it at the time.  Nobody knew it at the time, it wasn't talked about.  That came up like twenty-five years later.
Speaker 1: How did it come about, that your--
Speaker 2: The conversation came up, and no one else was in that thing.  I don't exactly how it was pinpointed, but they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, how did they select your work to be a part of that show, period?
Speaker 2: Well, for three years I worked in this frame shop, and Sweeney [ph.] came in, and the work was on the back of my table, my work table.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the frame shop you worked at?
Speaker 2: Benevy, B-E-N-E-V-Y, Herbert Benevy [Herbert J. Benevy Art Frame Shop], he was on 52nd Street.  And he saw the picture and he said, he gave me his card.  Another funny thing that happened in that same frame shop--Stanley Market [ph.] of Stanley Market's department store [Stanley Stores, Inc.] in the Midwest, I believe it was Texas--I had a painting on the floor and he wanted to know who did it.  And I said I did it, and he gave me a hundred dollar bill for the painting and said, "Ship it to me," you know.  And at the time, that was so easy that I wanted to make sure that the hundred dollar bill was a real hundred dollar bill, because I didn't know the guy, you know.  And then he said to me that was going to be traveling, and I should ship it to him.  So, I had time to check it out to see whether it was okay.  And up until about ten years ago I told him the story, and he was cracked up by that, you know.
Speaker 1: When you--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I don't know what happened to that picture.  I would like to have known, you know.
Speaker 1: When did you start working with wax?
Speaker 2: With?
Speaker 1: With wax.  You were doing, I read that you were doing something with wax.
Speaker 2: No, no, sometime instead of putting a varnish on a picture, I would use wax and rub it in, and it would give it kind of a caustic feeling, you know.  Some of the earlier tombs, the Egyptians used wax, the embalming kind of stuff.  And there was a German teacher by the name of Schultz [ph.], and you know, we were always in the chit-chat section of the class, you know.  And they wanted to know what was the technique.  And she would say, "The hell with the technique, what about the art?  You know, let Merton [HistoryMaker Merton Simpson] do his technique.  But look at Merton's art, don't worry about the wax thing, you know."
Story_ID: 300256
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So when you decided, when you took your first trip to Paris [France], it was because you were interested in African art?
Speaker 2: Well, in art as such, yeah.
Speaker 1: In art?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What did you discover upon that first trip to Paris?
Speaker 2: Oh, I really, I thought it was an exciting trip, because I was mainly buying African sculptures at that time, you know.  And I remember Hill [ph.] talking about his first trip to Paris.  And actually his first trip to Paris, he went with Alain Locke.  And he bought some things, you know, and I was able to acquire one of the pieces he bought there from a young dealer in New York [New York] by the name of, I can't think of his name.  But he bought this thing from Willard's [ph.] widow when he died.  And it was just a shallow head, but it was a fragment of a piece.  It was such a beautiful piece, and I was able to buy it from this guy, you know.  And he bought it for his son, but he knew I wanted it, so he asked me for seven grand [seven thousand dollars] for it, and I bought it.  And I own the piece, but I loaned it to a friend of mine, a Wall Street guy who's a great guy.  I won't mention his name, but he's just one of the great guys, and he has been very helpful to me with my art dealings and all that, you know.
Speaker 1: So, in Paris, how did you feel being in Paris as an American, as an African American?
Speaker 2: Well, Paris was fun, you know.  I didn't feel anything, you know.  Because you know, I knew the names of famous restaurants for soul food, and I knew numerous African dealers who would come to Paris from New York; I knew them, you know.  So, it was just like another thing like going home in a sense, you know; it was a great thing to do, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, did you feel a sense of freedom in Paris that you had not been able to feel in the United States?
Speaker 2: In a sense, yeah, yeah.  Of course, you didn't pay that much attention to it; it just happened, you know.  And in hindsight, you realize there was a difference, you know.
Speaker 1: In Paris, were you able to paint more than you were able to paint here in the United States?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so, because here it was easy for me to paint.  And finding space in Paris was not the easiest thing to do, you know.  Because I didn't have a flat in Paris until later on, you know.  But Paris was just a great city to be in, you know, because there was always something going on.  And all the big bands would come there and you'd hang out after the concert, you know, (unclear), The Living Room [Paris, France], The Blue Note [Paris, France], and then a jam session would go on.  I know one night there was Paul Jarvis [ph.], Eddie Lockjaw Davis, Ben Webster, and someone else.  And there were four saxophone players, and they started playing about twelve o'clock until about seven the next morning.  It was really a great session, you know, a great session.
Speaker 1: So you spent a lot of time in Paris?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I spent a lot, yeah.
Speaker 1: More than you actually did in the United States?
Speaker 2: For a while, yeah.
Speaker 1: What were you doing there during that time?
Speaker 2: Well, like I said, I was wheeling and dealing in the arts, you know, and hanging out with the musicians and just enjoying the life over there, you know.
Story_ID: 300257
Speaker 1: Well, you became one of the largest dealers, art dealers in African sculptures (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that's what they say, you know, but I never really believed all these stories, you know.  But I was still pretty lucky meeting the right people.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, what can you share with me about African art?  What did you discover about African sculptures?
Speaker 2: Well, that was a major sort of influence for most of the so-called modern art paintings in America, and not only in America, but in the world, you know.  People like [John] Brack, [Pablo] Picasso, all these people were influenced by that, although a lot of them didn't admit it, you know.  Picasso said he looked at the African art and he liked it, but he wasn't influenced by it, but he copied a lot of them.  But one who did a lot with it and said proudly that he did was [Constantin] Brancusi, you know, and he did actually copy the African masks.  And if you find one of those it's a fortune, you know.
Speaker 1: So, upon coming back into the United States when you were traveling back and forth between Paris [France] and the United States and you--
Speaker 2: I used to go three or four times a year, because I used to love to go to Paris, and from Paris to Africa.  And that's when I had my great time, you know, meeting with my friend Sammy Borou [ph.] who lived, he actually was born in the Ivory Coast; I mean he's Lebanese, you know.
Speaker 1: When you went to Africa for the first time, how was that experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, exciting, you know.  Like I said, you see the great things at the source, you know.  You go on a trip now and you'll find half a dozen great pieces.  And when I went, you could buy a hundred and fifty great pieces in a couple of months, you know, because I had the right connection and all that.  And that's where the great things were, you know.  But what's happened to African art in the last twenty years or so, it's unbelievable the way the prices have gone up, you know.  But the dealers don't make the money, the collectors make the money.  Because they buy it and they keep it, and then they finally sell it, you know.  Like a client of mine just called me two weeks, you know.  One of the pieces he bought from me--and I'm free to tell you--I think he bought it for maybe something like thirty-five thousand dollars, and he was offered something like three hundred [thousand dollars], you know, and that kind of stuff, you know.  I said, "At least you had enough sense to buy it at the time, and good for you that you made it," you know.
Story_ID: 300258
Speaker 1: So when you, when you think about--like in 1962 when James Meredith was trying to get into the university at Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi], which was the South, and you had grown up in the South.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Where are you in your life?  What was happening in your life at the time?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was just in New York [New York] working and living, you know.
Speaker 1: Were you, I read that you had some feelings about people like Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I wasn't that much of a radical, you know, but I respected these guys for getting out there and doing things, you know.  But the one I really liked, I liked Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], he was my favorite, you know.
Speaker 1: And why was he your favorite?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought he was a brilliant man and his approach to doing things, you know.  He was just, he was almost a [Nelson] Mandela, and Mandela to me was the end.  But Martin Luther King was somebody that could be in the same league, not as much, but he's certainly someone who was very special, you know.
Speaker 1: So, when did you start seriously dealing in African art?  What year was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it was in '54 [1954] or something like that.  But I was always collecting, but I started selling later on, you know.  But I just loved the art, and loved having it around me, you know.
Speaker 1: So when you--moving through like the '60s [1960s], let's say '68 [1968] when King was killed, do you remember where you were and what was going on in your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in New York and it was an unbelievable thing that's happened, you know.  And at the time, I liked Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] a lot.  I still like Jesse, but not as much as I did then, you know.  Because I respected him a lot when he would go and bring some prisoner back, or something like that.  I was so proud of that, that he could do it, you know.  And when he ran for president the first time, he did such a good job with that, you know.  But I have just learned to respect more and more the Reverend--you know, James Brown's buddy, you know.
Speaker 1: Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton]?
Speaker 2: Sharpton, yeah.
Speaker 1: What is it you like about him?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, he has style, and I love the way he spoke.  You know, he--
Speaker 1: At the [20044] Democratic [National] Convention [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I don't know why, but people thought he was just a charlatan, but he turned out to be much bigger than people realized.  And I think he's a necessary guy to have around.  You can say what you want about him, I still respect Al, you know.
Story_ID: 300259
Speaker 1: Why do you feel it's important to collect and deal African art?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, aside from the cultural thing about it, I think it's just a great art form, you know, and people like--I'm trying to think again how I would say this, you know.  I just think it's such a vital art form, you know, and across the board it's worthwhile, you know.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: All the major museums now have African art pieces, you know.
Speaker 1: And who are some of the museums that you work with?
Speaker 2: Oh, any one that I think would be interested in buying something that I have, but I don't pick any special museums.  I like the museums in Washington [D.C.].  And I think there's going to be eventually a very good museum in New York City [New York, New York].  They have the property that they're working on now, in the uptown area.  And there's a museum there in Long Island [New York] for the moment, and it used to be down on Chelsea [New York, New York], and they lost the space.  But that's going to be a good thing, you know, and they're working on it.  I think the city gave them the property, and they're building a complex uptown there, where there are living quarters plus the museum, you know.  And that's well on the way I understand, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to, I'm going to pick your brain a little bit about the cultural aspects of African art.  You said that was one of the things you felt was important about it, were the cultural aspects.  What are some of those cultural aspects?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see how I want to say it, you know.  Well, it's just a massive art form, you know.  I mean a good African piece is not African art, but its world art; that's the way I look at it, you know.  Like something came up recently in New York, and it was a mind-blowing piece.  I don't want to talk about it yet, because I don't have it.  But it's a world shaking piece.  Again, it's not a great work of African art, it's a great work of art, you know, it's a mind-blowing piece, you know.  And eventually, it's going to be well known, that's for sure.  I'll leave it at that.
Story_ID: 300260
Speaker 1: Why do you think it's important for this Spiral group to come together as a collective to examine whether or not there was such a thing as black art?  Why was that question even posed?
Speaker 2: Well, because people were saying, you know, well, he's a black artist.  And that--we wanted to clarify this, and that's why we got together on it.
Speaker 1: Do you feel that that limited you in a way?
Speaker 2: Not really, not for me and not for us.  But in terms of the line, I would think so, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you think that has changed, or do you think that--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's changed a lot for most people.  But some people will always believe this, that it's not the same thing--you know, that there's black artists, and this, that, and the other.
Speaker 1: How did Romare [Bearden] feel about it?  Did he feel that there's such a thing as black art?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, Romare never did, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But his collages were very African, or black.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: When he started to do the collages, it was more sort of an African background.
Speaker 2: Some of that, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Well, did he talk about the influences of that work with you and Norman [Lewis]?
Speaker 2: Not really.  He did more than talk.  He demonstrated what his approach would be, you know.  And Norman would talk a lot, but with few words, you know.  I don't remember some of the phrases that he used, but whatever he said it was pretty profound.
Speaker 1: So when you went into, when the Spiral group was formed, did you have any concept of what the outcome would be?
Speaker 2: No, no, but there was a little curiosity in the beginning.
Speaker 1: Did you think there was such a thing as black art before you started with the Spiral group?
Speaker 2: Well, some people did, but I never did.
Speaker 1: You never did?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: And you never did, because you felt that art was--
Speaker 2: Art was art, exactly, you know.
Speaker 1: So when you look a piece like that piece on the wall, this one behind you, 'The Wedding,' what would you say about that wedding scene?
Speaker 2: The wedding scene, well, that was a business thing for them.  He's a professional model, and that's the way they made their living, they posed for--that's--but it has such a feeling of Pippin [Horace Pippin], you know.  And most people when they saw that thought it was a Pittman, you know.  And Pittman was an untrained artist, but very talented, you know.  And if it were Pittman, that would be, you know, four or five hundred thousand dollars, you know.  And it's now it's twenty thousand dollars, you know.
Speaker 1: So out of that collective, the Spiral group, you know black art.  And you go to Paris [France] and you become interested--what piqued your curiosity in African art?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess it's the quality of the artistic merits that you get from a good African piece.  You know, they're well rooted, you know.  What most of the so-called modern artists strive for, the African artist did it, you know, as a part of his expression, you know--the design, the color form, the shapes, and all that kind of stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: For example, the sculpture of the mother and child back behind you--the head's on--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) that's from Nigeria, actually (unclear).
Speaker 1: So, to appreciate African art, do you think one has to be schooled or educated in--
Speaker 2: Not really.  It's good to learn as much about it as you can, but art is art.  And when you run into it, the quality of the artist usually comes through, you know.
Story_ID: 300261
Speaker 1: So let's talk some more about your life here in New York [New York].  You became, you are still a dealer.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you became a dealer and you started to sell African sculptures to museums?
Speaker 2: Yes, and private collectors.
Speaker 1: Private collectors?
Speaker 2: Private collectors more than museums, you know.
Speaker 1: Can you name some of your private collectors, some of the people that--
Speaker 2: Well, most collectors don't like to be named.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But some of the people I sold to was Bing, of Bing & Bing [New York, New York], the real estate guy, you know.  Actually, I sold a couple pieces to Ralph Ellison in the early years, you know.  Ralph didn't have big money, but he had good taste, you know, and he was very close to Romare [Bearden].  Ralph was very close, you know.
Speaker 1: Had he written the 'Invisible Man' when you met him?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Had he written the 'Invisible Man' when you met him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yes, yes, uh-huh.  And he played a little trumpet, you know.
Speaker 1: Did he play with your--
Speaker 2: No, no, but he, he was always kind of (unclear) you know.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet James Baldwin?
Speaker 2: I met him in Paris [France] actually, you know.
Speaker 1: Was there a collective of black artists in Paris?  Was there a salon?  Did you guys meet and report to one another--
Speaker 2: No, well, that's where I met Larry [ph.], what's Larry's last name?  Larry died two years ago.  I'll think of it in a minute.  But Larry, when we met in Paris, we spent a lot of time running around in Paris together.  And that's where I met Johnny Griffin, in Paris, the saxophone player, the great saxophone player.  We met in Paris, you know.

Speaker 1: So '95 [1995] was one of your first large one-man exhibitions at the Gibbes Museum of Art [Charleston, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you showed your own work?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And was that work, can you remember what that work was?  Was it a collection of paintings?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was paintings, yes.
Speaker 1: But that wasn't the 'Confrontation,' was it?
Speaker 2: No, no, the 'Confrontation' happened in the '60s [1960s], you know.
Speaker 1: Was that your first big show in the '60s [1960s], the 'Confrontation'?
Speaker 2: I would think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that show come about?
Speaker 2: Well, I know how the painting came about.  I was in Small's Paradise [New York, New York] one night during the riots in the '60s [1960s], and we were leaving the club about I guess two o'clock in the morning.  And the police said, "Look, don't come into the street now.  Go back into the club, and come out tomorrow when it's daylight," you know.  And that very next day I started doing the 'Confrontation' thing, you know, blacks and whites fighting each other, and hoping one day they'd get together.  And that's where I got the black and white thing, and that's where it started.  I started, I guess it was in '64 [1964], the first one.  And I did about I guess twenty-two works, and out of the twenty-two, I think I did a lot of drawings also.  But there were actually twelve big works that are still left, and some of the sketches I still have, you know.  Like, the one I still think is the best is the one on the cover, that one, that's my favorite picture.  My friend Sammie Brewer [ph.] wanted that picture, but the artist who gave me the show wanted it, and you know, I sold it to Bill [ph.], you know.  But he inherited an enormous estate, so he has that in his estate.
Speaker 1: So was that, was the 'Confrontation' your first one-man exhibition?
Speaker 2: No, no, I had a show in Paris [France], you know, and I had a show at the Schaeffer Gallery [New York, New York] on 57th Street.  I don't know the dates, but Mia [ph.] would have those dates, you know.
Story_ID: 300263
Speaker 1: We were talking about some of your private collectors.  And I know that some of them are Nelson Rockefeller and Helena Rubinstein.
Speaker 2: Okay, Eddie Lawrence, who was a musician.  In fact he's still a musician.  He did all of the big shows at the Kennedy Center [John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.], he writes all their stuff.  But he's one of my major clients, you know.  He's a man who's very generous, and has good taste.  And I've been working with him I guess for the last twenty-five years, you know, so I'm about two-thirds of his collection, you know.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder?
Speaker 2: Well, Geoffrey didn't buy from me, but I got Geoffrey to buy a nice drawing from Pearl's [ph.], a Montianni [ph.] drawing.  And twenty years later he was able to make a killing on it, so I'll always remember that, you know.  And he's such a talented man also, you know--Geoffrey.
Speaker 1: And off-camera, you spoke about [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks.
Speaker 2: Parks, I don't know him.  But I guess about five years ago I did a thing of him and sent it to him, and he was happy to have it kind of, you know.  But I never really met him.  I've been places where he's been, but I never had a chance to talk with him.  I'd like to do that at some point, you know.  But guys like that always have so many people after them, you know, that I never want to approach him.  At some point I'll run into him across the board, you know.
Speaker 1: So your work is in the permanent collections at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and one of my favorites, the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York.]
Speaker 2: There're a few Wall Street guys, you know, that I sell to, you know.
Speaker 1: You were recently honored at the Studio Museum in Harlem?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Since Lowery [Lowery Stokes Sims] took over, they're really growing and growing and growing, you know.
Speaker 1: So, to wrap all this up today, as you look back over your life and your career, what stands out for you as being some of the most important steps you've done?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the thing I ever liked most was that I was lucky enough to meet the right people at the right time.  That's the whole business you know, somebody to lean on, you know.  And everybody needs somebody, believe me, you know.
Story_ID: 300264
Speaker 1: So, do you feel that history is important?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I think so, especially for the people coming afterwards, the youngsters, you know.  They should know--like if you know where you're coming from, then you know where you're going, you know.
Speaker 1: And why did you agree to be a part of The HistoryMakers?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't choose to be a part of The HistoryMakers.  One of my friends--
Speaker 1: I said agree, agree.
Speaker 2: And I'm appreciative, you know, because any help you can get is always needed, believe me, you know.  And I can think of so many people out there that deserve to have it, you know.  And I won't get into names or anything, because who do you pick?  How do you pick somebody, you know?
Speaker 1: Well, I'll take a few names from you, people that we may not have.  That would be good for us.
Speaker 2: Well, let me think about a name and let me give it to you, you know.
Speaker 1: So, do you make it back down to the Carolinas ever?
Speaker 2: Whenever it's necessary, I go.  Well, the last time I went was about three years ago when my sister had her eightieth birthday, I did a surprise thing for her, you know.  And that's the one that still walks a lot.  She can walk twelve miles there in a couple of days, you know.  And like I said, I don't think I ever walked twelve miles, you know.
Speaker 1: So, you're known mainly as a painter in the South?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And in New York [New York], you know, you're known as a sculptor, an art sculptor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Art dealer, art dealer. Well, that's changing now, you know, that's changing now.
Speaker 1: How do you see yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, I consider myself a painter, you know. But I like collecting and I like the arts, you know.  So, I don't think one negates the other, you know.
Speaker 1: And I thought you'd also put the musician in there somewhere.
Speaker 2: Well, it is there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you still like to play?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.  Like I said, I'm not a great musician, but the good thing about it is I had a chance to play with some of the great musicians, you know.
Speaker 1: So, do you have any photographs for us to record today?
Speaker 2: There's a few things there, I don't know (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, well let me just take a look.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's not a whole lot.
Speaker 1: So, let's see what we have.  Well, before we cut to the photographs, do you have any last thoughts that you'd like to leave us with?
Speaker 2: Keep on doing the good things that you're doing, that's all.  And that's it, straight ahead, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you for doing what you're doing.  And as I said, keep on keeping on.
Story_ID: 300265
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.  Tell us, you won't remember the date you said, but you can tell us what the picture is.
Speaker 2: Well, this is a picture of the Royal Sultan [ph.], which was the jazz group who played at the local things in Charleston [South Carolina], and we played at most of the white clubs, especially on New Year's Eve.  We played at the big white clubs downtown.
Speaker 1: Where are you on the photograph?
Speaker 2: Let's see now.  Here, right on the right here.
Speaker 1: On the far right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the far right, yeah.
Speaker 1: With the saxophone?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was there a leader of the band?
Speaker 2: Yeah, William Goodhart [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell about this one?
Speaker 2: That was the studio they gave me in the [U.S.] Air Force.  I didn't live in the barracks, I lived in this little studio.  And that's where I painted, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, next, you tell us what we're looking at.
Speaker 2: That's one of my works that I had done in the Air Force, and it's a landscape.  I don't know where it is now, I'd like to know.
Speaker 1: So, what year were you in the Air Force?  About what year is that?
Speaker 2: That would have been '53 [1953], at the end of my tour.
Speaker 1: Okay next, and that's colonel?
Speaker 2: Timrod, T-I-M-R-O-D.  And that was a citation I'd gotten for doing the portrait of Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower].
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's an exhibition at the Barnett-Aden Gallery in Washington [D.C.].  And the young lady on the left is the daughter of [Fairfield] Porter, who was a famous artist living in Washington at the time; there're a number of books written on him.  And the guy on the right was Lonnie Aden [Alonzo J. Aden], and he was the gallery owner.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: And this is the artist Porter on the right.
Speaker 1: Next, please.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is the same.  That was a big landscape painting, with Lonnie sitting on the couch. I don't know the lady offhand, I don't know who she is.  But that was in one of the rooms at the gallery, you know.
Speaker 1: Next, please.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is a photograph of Simpson [HistoryMaker Merton Simpson].
Speaker 1: What year, do you know?
Speaker 2: It would have been early '50s [1950s], I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Dinkins [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins], Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] and Simpson.  That's when I did the benefit for Dinkins the first time he ran for mayor.  We raised $97,000 for him, and it took two years to get a thank-you note.  I remember doing that, you know, and finally getting a call from downtown.  I was bothered by that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is the portrait of Eisenhower.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a portrait of General Harper [General Robert Wells Harper].
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a photograph of General Twining [General Nathan Farragut Twining] and Harper presenting the portrait of General Twining.
Speaker 1: This one?
Speaker 2: That's one of my favorite photographs of Romare Bearden, Merton Simpson, and Hale Woodruff.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This one I cannot read.
Speaker 1: Is that Kofi Annan?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a bad image, I can't read it.  That's his wife there.
Speaker 1: And the last one?
Speaker 2: It's a frowning Simpson (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you for being such nice gentlemen.
