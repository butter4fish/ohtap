Speaker 1: Asking you-- Just a few like, these are sort of fun questions at the beginning.  I want to know what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: All southern foods: greens, vegetables.  I'm not-- don't care that much for meats. Pastas and that 's about it.  I'm a very simple eater.
Speaker 1: Okay, your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Being at home. A few years ago, I would have had a very different answer.  A wonderful weekend  for me is no place to go.  My schedule usually runs about three years ahead.  So again-- just to see a plane, I often leave home in tears, just on my way to the airport.  Or-- just to be home, that's a wonderful vacation for me.
Speaker 1: And your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Vivid oranges, reds.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying, or word?
Speaker 2: Peace.
Story_ID: 5407
Speaker 1: Now I want to start,  in your early years. And I'd like for you to tell us something about your family, and your growing up.
Speaker 2: Well I was an only child, grew up in Atmore, Alabama.  I was an only child until I was a sophomore in high school.  I have one sister and I'm fourteen years older than she.  I was teaching at nineteen.  I had kids in my class that were eighteen. A very close attachment to my grandparents.  My grandfather, I still spiritually talk to my grandfather, who has been deceased for thirty-four years.  In fact my mom--my mom and dad used to really cry.  I was always kind of pulled because I stayed with my grandparents until I was eighth grade.  My mom would come to see me every weekend  because she was in driving distance.  And I-- she would leave crying because I wanted to stay with my grandparents.  So she finally convinced me to come and live with them, when I was eighth grade.  But, my grandfather was very patient, would stop and explain things. He was a huge cattle buyer-- very successful business person.  And when I wasn't school, I lived going from town to town to the cattle sales.  He would let me bid on the cattle, or I could buy maybe two or three calves or a cow.  And I would keep them for a few months and then he taught me how to resell them at a profit.  And I had my own bank account, like when I was six.  Living in a small town, he would parallel park and watch me walk in the bank.  And I would go in with my little monies and make the deposit.  Or, I often laugh about it now.  But I though that I was so important, as a black kid especially, and during the time of great racism. Because, I would go in the bank and get a loan, and I thought I was getting it on my own.  And he would go in the bank before me (chuckle) and do all the presigning of the papers.  But I thought I was really hot stuff, that I could just walk in the bank and say, "I need a loan for $100,"  and they'd just give me the money.  And I didn't realize that he had done the prework.  Because I'd walk in by myself and say, "May I speak to Mr. So-and-so, and I'd like to apply for a loan."  He'd give me the dialogue to use.  And I'd walk out with $500, $400, and I thought, you know, I was really hot stuff.  That I could just go in and ask for it and get it.  And I found out later that he would have gone in and pre-done the cosigning. Well, really done the signing period, because I didn't have anything so. We'd sit up when I wasn't in school until 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning, sometimes just talking.  I think things that kids don't have time for today.With computers and phones and TV's.  But, you know, I learned the family history.
Story_ID: 5408
Speaker 1: And then with my grandmother, every evening she would visit her mother, my great grandmother.  So I would sit and hear these old ladies tell the family stories of who married who and their woes and their troubles.  And we would sit around this fireplace baking sweet pot-- We would put the sweet potatoes in the fire and bake them and cook them. And to me that was what children would consider perhaps boring today. I looked forward every evening to sitting with these old women around this fire.  I mean to me that was just really something to look forward to.  They would tell their ghost stories, they would tell the woes and, you know, rock in their rocking chairs.  And, and I used to visit Alex Haley [author of "Roots"] a lot, we became very good friends.  And we would talk about when they had problems they would rock very fast.  But when they were calm, those rockers would go very slowly.  And it's all of those things, those roots that I think we grew up on, that today's children-- There is no difference almost in children today 'cause they're all growing up on the same roots. And that's computers, stuff, things, that kind of thing. You know, to go out and draw water from the well was just a thrill for me, that kind of thing.  Picking berries and bringing them home.  We'd all get together as a group and your parent would break--bake a blackberry pie, or an apple pie.  But you had gone out and stayed all morning picking and then you came home traditionally for lunch.  And in, in those days, even the people--the men, you could always tell it was lunch time.  Because everybody came from their jobs at lunchtime, they had an hour for lunch.  And your parents would say, "It's lunch time because so-and-so, Jack or Robert is coming home."  And families ate together. You had the vegetables, the lemonade, the cornbread, and you said the blessing. And you heard the family talk.  And then everybody went back to work at 1:00 [p.m.].  I mean it's--it's so sad that today every member eats-- the child pops something in the microwave.  Even my mother at eighty-three, canned goods in her house!  I was telling her during the new year, I says, "You know mom, I'm not sure anything's going to happen [referring to the 'Y2K' millenium hype].  But will you please stock up on canned goods."  She say, "You know, I don't eat that junk."  She will not eat frozen vegetables, frozen foods.  She will not eat anything that's canned.  She stands in the grocery stores and it takes her forever to purchase grocery items.  Because she reads every ingredient in there.  Whereas today in  we are so busy that parents just go and pick stuff off the shelves, without even bothering to look at it.  But my mom will read everything that she puts into her body
Story_ID: 5409
Speaker 1: You know, I'd like to pursue,  just this little bit about your grandparents.
Speaker 2: (tape skips) --Journal that will last a hundred years, I started it.  And every family member writes in it for one-hundred years.  So you have a record of the family history for whole one hundred years.  I treasure things that's unimportant to most people. My children's--as I say, my daughter [Cynthia] just had a baby.  And I kept her baby brush.  And I thought she would want it, but she would prefer to go out and buy a new one.  I mean things that, that's so sacred to me.  Like everything in my mom's house would be a shrine. I would be the only one that will really get rid of all my stuff to take her furniture.  Today's generation just some how do not have that-- I mean those things don't mean much to them.  To them it's junk.  I guess it's what's important to us. I love learning, and I think just hearing their stories, about who was married to whom.  Just to hear those old ladies tell the stories and to go with my grandmother when a woman had a baby.  Everybody in the community went and cooked and took care of her.  And washed and ironed and took food and-- You know I would--they would send me to take this over to Miss Jones', take this to Miss Carrie, that kind of thing.  My grandfather who also had a grocery business, every Christmas Eve, it was my job to be the pied piper.  I mean--I would deliver the baskets to people's houses.  You know, take this basket.  It would be meats and canned goods and foods and raisins and apples and oranges and--just things that made me thinkI was really, really important.  I mean the old ladies would say you know, "Thank you baby.  God bless you."  You know, that kind of thing.  I think being accepted by grow-ups was more important to children then, than it is now.
Story_ID: 5410
Speaker 1: I think being accepted by grow-ups was more important to children then, than it is now.  I mean the talking back, the no respect.  We believed that if an elderly person pointed their finger at you, (chuckle) that the earth was gonna open up and something was gonna swallow you.  We were taught to really honor older people.  And just a whole different-- And that's what I try to teach in here.  Because parents just do not do it any more.  Being responsible, pride.  And it's happening to kids everywhere.  I don't know whether you saw the special on PBS [Public Broadcasting System- public television] the other night, about the kids now in Conyars.  They were in the clinic with syphilis and they are hi-fiving each other, "Girl you have it too?"  You know, I wouldn't have shown my face.  I--first of all it was nothing to be proud of, so almost everything goes.  You know, anything almost is accepted.  So there is no sense of shame.  All when I went to school it was very important to be bright.  To be accepted by the teachers, it was a disgrace to come from a no-good family.  Which is what they-- And that's what you were considered,  no-good.  Even the way your clothing hung on the line.  That's the kind of community I grew up in.  My mother or grandmother would pass by someone's house and say, "Look at those dingy sheets.  Some really no-good people live there."  Or if your shade or curtain blew up--I used to think as a young kid, that was before kids knew to speak out to their parents who listened.  But, I would think to myself, "That's really not my mother's business how those people's curtains look. That's really none of her business how they hang their clothing on the line."  But there was such a tradition.  You washed on Monday, you ironed on Tuesday.  You did not iron piece by piece by piece.  To be late-- My father was also in the undertaking business.  So when I became older, part of my job was to drive one of the, the cars that picked up the families.  'Cause I never worked for anyone else.  As my children have never worked for anyone else. We've all worked for each other as a family.  But again to be late for something, to be late for church in my house was a sin.  And I've watched even teachers here.  They just can't be on time.  You know, it's, it's the total person of being responsible.  You either did it, or you didn't do it.  We were not taught to give excuses.  Every morning one of my jobs was from the time I was eleven was to open that grocery store in the morning, to get the early field trade. Sometimes I was in that grocery store at 4:00 in the morning.  For the people who picked the people up to pick cotton in those trucks and they stopped to buy their luncheon meats in the mornings. Responsibility.  My mother didn't know what it was like to say, "Clean your room."  That was an automatic.  You-- I mean if you didn't, you really were pretty low class.  You automatically cleaned your room.  I mean you didn't talk back.  You automatically achieved in school.  You know, I never heard a kid talk back to a teacher.  We, we respected our teachers.  We admired them.  Well, the kids do the same for me here, but they don't do it for the other teachers sometimes here.  I mean, when I speak to them, you know, I have no problems with them.  My children who work here with me, my son--Patrick, helps me train teachers across the country.  Cynthia, runs the school.  But again and my niece is also here.  But this-- just the respect for grown-ups.  The respect for church.  I mean we didn't chew gum in church.  We didn't turn around in church.  We sat and we respectively listened.
Story_ID: 5411
Speaker 1: Let me ask you what about your up-bringing?  Because--I mean you've talked about you know the respect and learning and, you know and, and what was expected of you, in the environment and also the, the fact that you were always from a child you were taught to see yourself as important. Are there other things that you would say about that environment that made you what your are today?
Speaker 2: I think my parents.  I still don't remember very much I learned in college.  I went through the ritual of getting good grades because my parents-- to please them.  And it was very important to me to please my parents.  To carry on the pride, the tradition.  That was very, very important to me. I think what made me what I am is my parents, and the consistency.  I mean I wanted to be as successful as my parents and my grandparents. It--in those days, it was quite rare to be black and to be successful.  To see poor whi-- to see not only poor whites, but whites sneaking to our house to borrow money from my dad, gave me a great sense of security.  Because I didn't think whites were as superior.  And the ones that other people admired during the day, I had seen them in my grandfather's house (chuckle) borrowing money from him at night, okay.  So I think the determination of my parents and grandparents, the--we would get chastised. As I say, I'm fourteen years older than my one sister.  But if we walked in church and didn't hold our heads up, my mom would say, (spoken sharply) "What was wrong with you today? Walking with your head all down." She would scream down the street, "Get your head up," on my way to school.  people I've often heard the comment to her, "I can always tell your child on the playground."  We were brought up with a great sense of pride.  At one time, my grandfather was the only person in the whole town that had a telephone. You know how people scream, "Got a telephone," you know, scream across the community.  Because he was in the funeral business, he had the nicest car.  We were the first people with cars when many blacks were still driving the buggies and the horses and tying them to the trees at the church.  Again so it's--I think you learn your roots from within the home, I believe.  You know, your self esteem from who your parents are.  Not what they say, but what they practice.  My parents were very consistent.  Every Sunday morning, not some, I went to Sunday school with my grandmother and my mother met us there later. okay.  And not some Sunday, but every Sunday.  I never remember my grandmother missing church or Sunday school.  Seeing her on her knees, saying her prayers every night.  Not some nights, but basically the same time every night.  And if you needed to come through the room at that time, you knew that, that was a ritual and you had to stop  where you were, until she finished praying.
Story_ID: 5412
Speaker 1: I mean what you see more than what parents say-- you know my parents were always saying and grandparents, "Oh my,  they're so bright."  Especially my grandmother and my grandfather, "Oh, she such a bright child."  When the salesman would come in to sell merchandise, and that kind of thing to my grandparents.  My grandfather would say, "Say this poem for them Marva.  You know, my grandchild is so bright.  "Do this Marva, do that."  So again it's-- It was always that validated.  You know, I was embarrassed to do anything wrong.  Because teachers would say to me, "Now Marva you know your parents."  And when I got to college, going to a small private college [Clark College, now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia.]  The housemother would say--  One night we sneaked away to get some chicken.  I think God, what a small crime in comparison to today 'cause you were not to leave the campus!  And that's when we had this strict housemother.  And about eight of us had sneaked away to get some chicken at Paschal's, which is one of the famous restaurants in Atlanta [Georgia].  And the housemother seized the eight of us.  And all eight girls, and she said, Marva Col-- I mean. "Marva, you know you can't afford to go home.  You know your parents would have a fit."  And I had to say to myself, "I know I can't either."  But that was expectation.  Because my parents came to visit me at the college frequently.  And everybody's always said to me, every teacher, "Marva, you know your parents would have a fit."  And the neighbors would say to me, "Marva you know if your parents knew that."  Because we were caught once throwing green plums down one of the older lady's wells.  'Cause that was so much fun--green peaches and green plums, that's the kind of master mischief we did in those days (chuckle). And they would--of all the kids doing it, they would always say, "Marva, you know your parents would have a fit."  And so, when they say it takes a whole village, they act as if that's a new something.  I mean, I grew up in that kind of village.
Story_ID: 5413
Speaker 1: But what we call a backroads town, a backwards town is really more to me supportive, than our so-called modernity.  Because we didn't have these television sets, and when we did get one, as a teenager, we were privileged to sit with our parents and watch what they watched.  We didn't have--we couldn't say, "I don't want to see that."  I mean you watched what your parents watched and your were privileged.  You didn't know you had a right to say, "I don't want to watch that."  When your parents-- you knew were ritualistic, when it was dinner time.  You didn't ask, "What do you have for dinner?"  I mean that's that just not something you did. Every day at 6:00 [p.m.] you had dinner.  And you sat with your parents.  And you held hands and you (unclear).  Some of the time, even now, in a hurry and we all forget.  When my mom visits me, she'll say, "And what's your problem?" (chuckle) In fact, 'cause sometimes when I hurry, you know, I have forgotten to practice that.  But she'll say to my husband and I, "And what's wrong with the two of you?  You know civilized people do not eat without saying--"  And she will have to constantly remind-- not always but, when she's there the first day, I'll forget.  But from then on, I, I get back into that--'you know what you're supposed to do'.
Story_ID: 5414
Speaker 1: Now I want to go,  and ask a question about (unclear).
Speaker 2: And my grandfather did too.  The family still has it there.  But I think my-- I didn't come from a negative family.  If a white kid called me the "N" word, and I was sitting in a car:  And my grandfather would say to me, and I would say, "That kid called me--." Say, you know, the white kid is sitting in the car net to me, and I'm sitting in a car and I would get called the "N" word.  And I would say to my grandfather why they had called me.  And he would say, "And?  Is that your name?"  And that was the end of it.  And sometimes he would say, "Isn't it sad that this kid will never know what a wonderful, bright person you are."  And then he'd start on another conversation.  I don't deal in negatives today.  I really don't worry about what people say about me, or the criticism, I could care less.  I am on this earth to be all that I can be.  And As I look back, I think I learned that from my parents.  But, you know, my grandfather constantly told me--I mean my mother constantly told me how my grandfather sold meat from door-to-door during the day and farmed with a lantern at night.  Which meant he didn't sleep at all.  To keep his family out of the home, we were the only black family that did not work in the homes of whites, only one.  You know, and I kind of grew up.  Because sometimes I was an only child and I would go children's houses to play. You called it 'going to play' with someone at that time.  You know, you played the hide and seek games, build a playhouse.  And the parents would often say to me, "You go home, my kids can't afford to have free time like you. My kids have to work."  So my mom would say, "Get a book and learn to stay out of other people's houses."  And now I voraciously. You know, just being here, I've read four books in the last week and a half.
Story_ID: 5415
Speaker 1: So again I learned to just-- You know, I would read books about Japan, China.  And I kept a diary that said, "Today I went to,  Germany.  And I went to the Rhine rural district.  And,  I saw a statue of Rhenkin.  And here I am in Atmore, Alabama."  And I also tore picture from magazines of the kind of house I was gonna have when I grew up.  And kids would say to me, "Don't you know you're a black kid,"  and, "Only white people have houses like that."  And I was called the crazy kid. But I kept a scrapbook of furniture, of houses, they way my house was gonna look, or the places I was gonna visit.  And when I grew up I had visited every one of those places. I had the house that I said I was gonna have.  I have done--and I used to-- When I got bored in school I would practice writing my name over and over.  And I would way to myself, "One day the whole world is gonna know who I am."  And I was in Paris.  And someone walked up to me and said, "Aren't you Marva Collins?"  And I thought, "Everything that I dream has kind of come--I have made happen."  And I tell the children here, "If I can teach you the joy of success and self-esteem, you don't need a teacher.  You really don't need a teacher and you don't need a school."  You know, because I had castdowns.  We had-- black kids had second-hand books.  We had outdoor toilets.  We had wood-burning stoves.  We had teachers with only a tenth grade education, but I was always a reader. I remember being in a 6th-- 4th, 5th, 6th grade class.  Because that's why I graduated so early from college.  Because I went from fifth grade to seventh grade, from seventh to ninth.  But when the teacher was teaching the fifth graders or the seventh graders, I waited for her instructor magazine every month.  I couldn't wait until she re-- Now that I'm grown up, I read it more than she did.  I looked forward to receiving that teacher magazine every month.  And I'd sit there and read it from cover to cover.  I think, again it's that I always knew there was a bigger world out of Atmore ,Alabama.  And I tell children, "You know, books, reading--"  I was talking to them today about why is it prisoners sometimes come out of prison so bright.  Because for the first time learning and knowledge is important to them.  Just a dictionary.  You know, I would find as many words as I could in the dictionary and see how many I could memorize.  When I was nine, I read about six copies of 'God's Little Acre' [by Erskine Caldwell, University of Georgia Press 1995 reissue].  Because every time my mother took it, I figured there has to be something in that book,that she did not want me to read it.  I mean, you know, every time I'd buy a copy, she'd throw it away.  And I read everything.  So I didn't realize that it was risqué, I wasn't supposed to read it.  But the more she took it away, the more I would find some secret place and hide and, and--and read it.  But I've always loved reading.  I mean if she-- we used to shop being small town in Mobile in Montgomery [Alabama].  And when my-- my mom was an avid shopper and still is today. But while she was shopping, I would sit in the book department and sit on the floor and read the books because black kids could not use the libraries there.  But I've always loved to read and still do.  I mean, I read with a passion, for me a book is like, like giving me a very expensive gift.  You know, at Barnes and Noble [national chain bookstore] in every city, or especially down in Hilton Head [South Carolina], they will say to me, "Mrs. Collins, did you leave some books in the store for someone else?"  because they all see me in a small town, they know me now.  They'll see me with these two bags of books.  And each Sunday, after the New York Times [newspaper], I sometimes don't read the paper.  But the first thing I read is the book sect-- I mean the, the book review. And I'm on the phone on Monday,  faithfully leaving my list of books.
Story_ID: 5416
Speaker 1: Okay.  How would you say then that reading has enriched your life?
Speaker 2: I think you find that some of the problems that you think are unique, other people have shared too.  I think that you find that there's a commonality.  That regardless of what color we are, we all have basic needs and basic commonalties:  And that's good health, peace.  And the other stuff really don't matter.  Nothing else really matters.  It's all stuff.  And I tell the kids.  "You have sixty cars, you've got one butt.  (Chuckle), In a home you sit inaif you got a house with 200 rooms, you can only sleep or be in one room at the time.  You've got 900 dresses.  You can only wear one at the time."  And I think what you see, as you read and, you see so much of you in everyone.  That was all have so many--and we get this racism bit going.  But white, red, green, pinstriped, polka dot, we all have so many of the same needs.  We all want to get home safely today, we all want our families to be safe and intact.  We want to hear good news when we go to the doctor, we want so many of the very same things.
Story_ID: 5417
Speaker 1: Okay, you went into teaching it's said because you couldn't get a job as a secretary.
Speaker 2: Well that's not exactly true.  I did both.  I worked--when I first came to Chicago, I worked as a medical secretary.  I love challenges.  I love to do things I don't know how to do, sometimes.  And when I'd get to a medical term, I would  rather than ask the surgeon, I worked for a Dr. (Nattlehalf ?) who was one of the most brilliant--and I always loved to work for white brilliant people, because to me that's how I learned.  But when I'd get to a word I couldn't spell, I would call Picker X-Ray [Corporation] and play the machine over the phone, (chuckle) and ask them how to spell it.  Finally they sent a book called 'X-Ray Terms' and I would sit and study that book.  All night until I learned how to spell the words.  And Dr. (Nattlehalf?) used to say to me, "You're the only typist that never asks me how to spell words."  I'd get little frustrated with people who want--like when I working with the teachers down in Florida.  They want you to show them everything.  Like they will--I was teaching the "ch" spelling "c", American "ch" as in: chat, church.  The hard Italian "ch" as in: ache, trachea, bronchitis or chrysalis. Or the French "ch" as in, in: chagrin or chablis, Charlamagne.  And one teacher said, "Where do I find those?"  And I says, "My bright wonderful one, there is a section in the dictionary (chuckle) that says 'ch'."  "But I don't know what you know."  And I said, "I wasn't born knowing either.  But it's how you spend your time."  You know, I don't watch television. I give up a lot. There are a lot of movies I don't go to see.  Because reality says, "You can't do it all."  If I give the children the poems to memorize, after you hear thirty children say the same poem and you're doing consistency, you're bound to memorize it.  And if you teach for thirty years the way I have, and you've had these children saying these poems over and over, you should have a litany of poems memorized.  But again, I think I've seeked for things myself.  I don't wait for someone to do it for me.  And I think that especially has happened in the teaching profession. Is that, "I don't know how to do that," "But I don't know what you know."  Well, I didn't know what I, know either until I searched for what I know.  You know, seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened. But I think a kind of apathy of wanting someone to do it for you. That I'm some kind of a whiz or some kind of wizard, that just happened automatically. You know, it's, it's a lot of pain, a lot of hard work and a lot of consistency.
Story_ID: 5418
Speaker 1: Now, I want to ask what brought you to Chicago [Illinois] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Fate. It's where I'm supposed to be. I would have given you a very different answer if you had asked me. Well, I was very over protected.  I taught at home for--two years.  My grandfather had his own--gas tanks in the back yard, for all of his vehicles.  He would get up in the morning, gas my car, sit there, take my books, keep it warm, get up at night, put the cover on me.  And I'm supposed to be a teacher at, you know, nineteen. And they always were just so proud of me. And really I'm in Chicago [Illinois] because they all loved me to death. I just had to be--and that's one of the things. The other is I am where--we're always where we're supposed to be when we follow our inner instincts.  You know, when I left Chicago, my husband [Clarence] of thirty-four years died of a stroke, my children's father. And the city began to have--the house that I lived in began to have very, very sad memories for me.  I left a fourteen room old Victorian house with all my furniture in it, all my clothing.  Left the school that I had given my life to.  But I just knew it was time to leave.  I'd visited Hilton Head [South Carolina].  I'd done some work in Birmingham, Alabama.  And I went over to-- just to relax a day or two after work I was doing in a seminar there.  And I was on my way to the grocery store, and I got lost.  And I passed by a real estate building and I went in. And said, "I'd like to look at some houses.  And I bought the first house I looked at, and I thought to myself, "You don't have money for that house.  How are you gonna do it?"  And it's just that faith of when it's time to do something, and I do it.  And I scare people to death.  I am remarried [George Franklin],  I scare my hus-- He tells everybody, "I scare him to death."  He says, "But you know, her faith is so strong.  But she always survives."  And it's very scary.  Because my husband--is trained as a--engineer.  So you know, an engineer and somebody who just goes out and does. I mean I drive--he will grab his head sometimes and say, "Marva, are you crazy?" And it always works for me, because I have great faith that it's going to work.  And if it doesn't--nobody is dead and I learned--what did I learn from this?  The poor man it--I can understand how it really does drive him completely crazy. You know, my fourth book I just finished--and, and he's very bright.  And when he proofreads something that I write, the errors there, but it has to be precise for him.  So when I write something now, I don't show it to him.  I just zip it right off to the publisher.  And I'll say to him, "How's that for errors?"  I mean they'll always accept it.  But with him it has to be rewrite and it has to be just right.  And my philosophy is follow your passions and don't be afraid of mistakes because if you can't make a mistake, you can't do anything.

Speaker 1: Ms. Collins, now you came and you were working both as a medical secretary and then teaching.  Was that around the time in Chicago where-- I'm not on the teaching side that African American teachers could only be substitutes.  Was that around that--
Speaker 2: Well the reason I was a substitute teacher, because again,  it's so uncanny.  I needed a reading course.  But I was such a good substitute teacher that I had the same school and the same position for fourteen years.  No one ever explains that. It was my classroom that they-- the principal brought everyone into.  Reading is a gift that was given to me from God and as a passion I've been reading since I was four years old.  My grandmother taught me to read and spell the books of the Bible when I was four.  You know, Leviticus--and Deuteronomy.  And if you can spell those--Shadrach, Meshach and Abendigo, I was spelling those when I was four.  So I was reading before I went to school.  I needed to take a, a reading course in order to be certified.  I enrolled in a reading course and the professor didn't know as much about reading as I did.  I stayed a week, and I said to my husband, "If this is what I need to be certified, then I will never be certified."  I mean that's, that's my forte.  I can teach any child to read in a month, any child.  And that's a gift that was given to me. I often say when the parents complain about a teacher in here--Sometimes I will say to them, "You know, my teaching, I was sent by God to do this, I know that for sure." The teachers are hired, I was sent.  And there's a real difference in performance there.  So again reading--there isn't a word in the dictionary that I can't spell, any word.  And there isn't a word in the dictionary that I don't know the meaning of, any word.  Any word that you turn to I can give you a synonym, an antonym or--it's just something I know.  And when they do these game shows, every question they ask, I know the answers to them.  Not because I'm brilliant, but I've been reading since I was four years old.
Story_ID: 5420
Speaker 1: Now what-- When it came time, you had children in school, and you were not happy with the public school schools.
Speaker 2: My kids were not in public schools, my kids were always in very expensive private schools.  Now two of the best private schools on the North side.  I never skimped on education.  My husband and I had a second hand car that would barely go. The kids ate well, but we, we were paying a mortgage and private school tuition.  No, they were in very, very expensive private schools.
Speaker 1: What schools were they in?
Speaker 2: You know, I'd rather not call the name.  I, I don't want to be negative.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But they're the two most expensive private schools on the North sh--on the North side.
Story_ID: 5421
Speaker 1: And then so what, what was the inspiration for--describe that for--  I am doing what I was supposed to do.  You know your answers-- Any time you have the same pat answers, I don't think you have evolved.  I now know that I started these schools because this was what I was supposed to do.
Speaker 2: But can you describe the process?  What, what was the whole--
Speaker 1: Well, I had $5,000 to my name.  And, now that I look back, it's very scary.  Not a penny left.  Many times we--I was so hungry on Fridays-- the kids had--you know, we always saw to the kids had-- but I couldn't wait to get to the grocery store on Fridays.  I, I don't mean just, desperately hungry.  But you know how the cabinets and the refrigerator get after waiting 'til my husband got paid.  As they say, I just said to my husband, that I'm gonna open my own school.  And again I was told, "Do you know what you're doing?"  Even my mom says, "You know, are you out of your mind?  You have--you know, you have three children,  you have a mortgage."  Because we started off our marriage with a home, because that's the way I grew up.  But again, I just had faith that it would work.  I am very determined that way.  What I believe can happen, I make it happen.  And rarely do people see what I see.  You know, but everything I've done in my life, I was told I was crazy and it couldn't be done.  So I've learned when I hear that now, that's exactly what I'm supposed to do because everything-- kids in Alabama used to say, "You're crazy, you can't do that."  Everything I've attempted, I was told couldn't be done.  And now I've learned that, that means go and do it Marva.  Every time they say, "You're crazy.  It's can't be done."  That's what you should do.  Because everything-- I had been told that about all my life, I have succeeded.
Story_ID: 5422
Speaker 1: I think education to me is knowing how much you don't know.  Unless they call a moratorium on books.  I feel so inadequate.  I mean there--you just will never know.  Because once you learn this it will say, "See this,"  then you see that, it will say, "See this."  If you're reading Socrates, it will say, "See Plato."  You read Plato, it will say, "See Aristotle."  You read Aristotle it'll say, "See this."  So I, I think to me education is knowing that how illiterate we really are.  That's what it means to me.  Is that we will never--I will never, never know all the things I'd like to know. Ever.  Because I often spend an hour or two in the local bookstore, down in [Hilton Head] South Carolina.  And I'll read for a while in the philosophy section.  I'll read for a while in the religion section.  I'll read for a while in the art section.  I'll read for a while in the home decorating section.  And that's the wonderful thing about books stores today because there was a time you had to purchase the books, or go to the library.  You can sit and read all day and never have to buy a book. You know, so that's what education is to me.
Story_ID: 5423
Speaker 1: Now with your, with your school.  Why do you-- why do you feel like (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Because I'm so dog-eared determined to give children the chances that I've had.  Or to, to feel good about--not about the praises others give you, but to feel the praise about yourself, when you see yourself back in the mirror.  And you can say, "You are so bright.  I like you."  And I give myself a hug.  And that's why we have mirrors in the kindergarten rooms.  And when the kids pass by, they have to say, "I like you.  You are so bright."  I think there's nothing in the world that you really cannot be hurt when you truly like yourself.  Not the praise of other people.  Yes some people buy things to be admired by others.  Or some people do things to, to be admired.  But I think to know that you've earned the accolades.  For example, I spoke to 200,000 people for the Amway Corporation.  I spoke to 20,000 in, Indianapolis in the morning, flew out to Boston the same day and spoke to 60,000 that evening.  That was 80,000 people in one day.  And I don't use speeches, I don't use notes.  I never know what I'm going to say.  I always go into the bathroom.  I find a quiet corner and ask God to give me the right words for this audience.  I never know what my first line is going to be, and yet people are spell-bound.  Because I have a passion for what I do.  I don't do it for the accolades of others.  I don't care about the criticism.  I don't care what people say.  But when you know what you've done, then you aren't dependent on-- 'Cause I tell the children, "People will only validate you if you do what they like."  You know, if you say, "I love sweet potato pies, and I cook sweet potato pies.  But I love coconut pies."  Then you don't love me as much when I cook the coconut pies, because I'm not doing what you want.  And as long as you do what other people want, then again, you're a wonderful person.  And that's why I've learned to love me, to like me.  Or I'm oft--my children often tease me and say I'm very arrogant. It's not arrogance, but I validate me.  Because if I don't I might be disappointed if I wait for that validation from someone else.  And that's in  relationships and everything.
Story_ID: 5424
Speaker 1: You know, if a husband leaves we try to immolate the other woman he's leaving for.  We think there's something wrong with us, we feel inadequate, we feel depressed.  You know, it just means that somehow the appreciation for who you really are has some how escaped.  My husband laughs because I always tell him, "If you ever leave me, I'm gonna get you some real help.  Because I know that you've lost it all.  Because I am the best there is.  There is no better."  And, and it's amazing when you develop that attitude, how you are treated.  Because you have those securities.  And I often aggravate people, because they'll say, "You know, you think you're better than other people. You look down--,"  I don't. But I still think I am pretty wonderful, I think I am pretty wonderful.  I think I am bright, I think I am unique. And I'll teach every child in here to think that. When they misbehave, their punishment is, they have to write one hundred reasons why they are too wonderful to do what they are doing. And that, and they have to be in alpha order:  I'm adorable, I'm beautiful, I'm courageous.  I give them the first ones until they get the hang of it.  I'm delightful, I'm effervescent, I'm fabulous, I'm heavenly. I'm idolized, I'm just wonderful, I'm a kindred spirit, I am laudable. I am (unclear).  I am never, never indolent.  And it goes on to "z".  And if they do it again, they, they have to use another synonym.  They can't use adorable any more.  Now the children will say to new students, "I don't know why you don't behave, because I'm tired of telling Mrs. Collins how wonderful I am."  So you use negative behavior, but with a positive (pause) with positive learning.  And that's the greatest gift you can give people is self esteem.  You know, that I'm okay just the way I am.  My nose, my hair.  My mom gets on me all the time.  Because I don't go to the beauty shop.  I wash my hair, I wet it, I push it back and-- Where I get my hair done should not validate me.  The kind of car I drive does not validate me. You're interested in my car, you know.  Not who I am.
Story_ID: 5425
Speaker 1: Now what--over the years, because you (unclear) school for twenty
Speaker 2: Twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: Twenty-five years.
Speaker 2: Can you share with us, some stories.  You know, of children that you've touched or you know.
Speaker 1: Well just, you know, little--I mean God we could be here-- I should ask you how much time do you have, (chuckle).  But--anyway the young man, like about six years-- But the young man from Creighton [University in Omaha, Nebraska. Referring to 23 year-old student Kevin Ross] who came in a second grade education.  I taught him to read in just ten months at a college freshman level. The little boy who--you know, once was being reared by his father.  His mother had died, and bought me some perfume with , mixed for water.  And he stood there to see if I was gonna use it, and I did.  And he said, "You smell just like my mommy.  And he transferred--after fifth grade.  And about two years later, this is when I taught in the public schools, I heard from him.  And he said, "Dear Mrs. Collins, I just graduated from eighth grade."  I'm sorry three years later, "I graduated from eighth grade. I graduated second in my class."  Then a few years later I heard from him, "Dear Mrs. Collins, I just graduated from college."  And this kid was always so dirty and so unkempt.  And I would go out and get him second had clothes and that kind of thing.  Give him hugs and help him clean his nails, help him get his work right.  "I graduated from high school.  I graduated first in my class."  A few years later, I heard from this kid.  "Dear Mrs. Collins, I thought you would like to know, I am now a medical doctor," and he signed it, Robin Robinson, MD.  And those are the times that, you know--how much money could you have to top that? I mean so you got 50 million dollars.  I still think I'm the richest person on earth.  Even when I-- And I'm not cool with the children, but I insist on excellence, and they all hug me.  And I'll say to them, "Are you hugging me after I've been on you all day?"  Children know, children and animals and that's why I love them so much.  All my friends are really children and animals, (chuckle).  I don't-- I'm not around grown-ups too much.  'Cause children know when you love them.  They really know.  And the little kid that told me down in Florida at the schools I'm working with, "I like me when I'm with you."  I mean, just-- we could be here on and on.  And, you know with--those are the kinds of things to me that makes me very, very rich.  Which means, I don't need the stuff.  I mean I grew up with nice things and it's wonderful.  But I'd rather be with a kid then anything that I know.  Because I don't have to watch what I say.  I don't have to say, "But that's not what I meant."  They're not argumentative.  You know, "Yes, Mrs. Collins."  I mean just the little notes I get, "I love you and--"  You know, down in Florida the kids--my Christmas present this year was seeing all of those kids leaning from the bus windows yelling, "I love you Mrs. Collins."  Who needs a Christmas gift after that?  So I told everybody don't give me anything I can't eat.  I mean, I don't want the stuff.  It's, it's all stuff.
Story_ID: 5426
Speaker 1: Now I want to go into,  the discussion of when you-- You know, you had the 60 Minutes [television] special. And you were really sort of discovered, and you know what I'm saying.  The United States--
Speaker 2: The first one [aired in 1979]?
Speaker 1: Yes, the first one.
Speaker 2: How did that make you feel?  And you know, what happened as a result of that
Speaker 1: I don't take that as--you know, I was in my house.  What that help me do was buy a building after that. We had it made for a television movie [ The Marva Collins Story, aired 1981, starred Cicely Tyson and Morgan Freeman].  Which helped us buy a bigger building.  This building is not a federal-- We take no federal funds at all.  When I stand here and look at my efforts in the last twenty-five years.  It hasn't been about me.  When you come in this building, it means I've done a lot of traveling across this country.  I've used my--I could be a very, very wealthy woman.  I gave all the monies from the movie.  I purchased the first building.  We have-- I still run the seminar business out of that. I don't get heady about things.  You see, I've always--I was always wonderful.  The only thing that frightened me about that, well not frightened me, but I never shall forget.  That came on, on a Sunday.  On Monday, I was over at Water Tower [Place, an upscale mall on Chicago's Gold Coast] and the policeman walked up to me and said, "Marva Collins?"  And I said, "I haven't done anything, (chuckle)."  You know, "What did I do?"  And he said, "I just want you to know how much I admire you."  But that was my first--he was the first person I met after the 60 Minutes piece.  He was the first person that noticed me after that.  But I don't get--I'm very embarrassed, and audiences know that.  I don't give bios, because I just want people to say, "Ladies and gentlemen, Marva Collins."  Because when we leave this world, I don't think God's gonna be interested in a bio.  I am very--I do things very anathema to how most people do.  I don't give bios.  I mean you either know what my work has been, or I just do not do bios.  My work must speak for me.
Story_ID: 5427
Speaker 1: How did you-- was there any feeling you had when the movie started, you know--
Speaker 2: I've never seen that movie in my life.  I cannot watch me, I don't watch the 60 Minutes pieces [1979 airing and 1996 follow-up.]  I do not watch them when my husband puts it on.  And when it comes in, I go to another part of the house.
Speaker 1: But didn't you consult with her on the phone?
Speaker 2: Oh, well I consulted with-- Cicely [Tyson, noted actress] lived with me,  she had Morgan Freeman [Academy Award winning actor, played her husband Clifford in the 'Marva Collins Story'.]  But sure you consult with them.  But I don't get into me.  I came back to my school.  I had a school to run.  I couldn't sit around being important on the set all, every day.  I mean I consulted with them and watched the stills, but-- I'm not a movie actress.  I'm a teacher, I never forgot that.  You know.  I remember Cicely one night wanted to, to kind of go out to-- you know, I'm living on the West side in my wonderful Victorian house.  Cicely wanted to go out to eat at the Ritz Carlton and those kind of places every night.  And I said, "Now, my wonderful one, you knew that I lived on the West side when you came.  We don't-- we're not particularly known for escargot on the West side of Chicago [Illinois].  I am a teacher.  I go to bed with the kids."  I mean when I go  home, I am--'Cause I'm on my feet.  I'm the-- one of the few administrators I know, my daughter and I, that are in the classrooms and not sitting behind a desk.  Like I tell you, I don't have an office.  That room upstairs is everybody's office.  It's where I plop when I'm tried of walking through this building.  But I said to her, " You know, I'm not an entertainer, I have to keep this school going." You can't have one big dash of a movie.  And what happens to the excellence that caused it to be in the first place?  In fact, they said to me after 60 Minutes, "It would be interesting to see why happens to you and your family after this is shown."  They said, "Fame has destroyed a lot of families."  But see, I've always known who I was.  So that--those kinds of things-- you know if I had 50 billion dollars, zillion dollars, I would still be just who I am.  Things don't bother me.  You know, I still drive my Honda. I am comfortable if I have peace and health.  I am comfortable wherever I am.  Because houses don't make you happy.  Things don't make you happy. I love the property down in South Carolina.  I love the yard.  Because I have all this space.  I can sit out on the bank and watch the water drop in the,  the rain drop, get my hair all wet, my clothing, watch the rain drop into the water.  Watch the birds sit on the water in the mornings.  It's now February.  I can watch my azaleas be all in bloom,  a month or two from now.  I love working in my yard.  I love seeing things grow. So really, it's simple. It's watching the beautiful trees that are there.  I have about--800 trees on the property.  It's, it's really simple.
Story_ID: 5428
Speaker 1: I tell my husband all the time about that last hurricane.  If the house goes, I still have the yard.  And that's really what's important to me, is that yard. The space.  I don't get carried away about stuff. It's all stuff.  And I do get very excited about these kids.  And kids all over the country now, you know.  Kids in Springfield Mass., [Massachusetts] at the school, the kids in Cincinnati [Ohio].  When I hear the Marva Collins creed, the kids saying it all over the country when I walk into these schools.  And the little kids say, "There she is."  The kids here ask me, "Will you come to your room tomorrow?"  I was with the kindergartners when you came.  And doing some stories and things with them.  That to me is my Rolls Royce, that's my billion dollars.  These little kids beckoning to me.  You know, they do this whenever I come-- Or, here she comes. That kind of thing.  I get let--hundreds of letters and little picture from kids and little hand-drawn cards.  And that means more to me than the exotic card that you could go out and buy and send me.
Story_ID: 5429
Speaker 1: I'm putting on my "no-work" clothing.  Ok, or you should see me jumping into those, those, sweat pants and that shirt the moment I get home.  I mean walking around that property in my bare feet, that to me is just-- drives my husband again crazy.  Because he tells me I'm going to get a fungus and I says "You know you're a Northern guy, I'm a Southern girl.  You can't do what I do."  I'm not gonna get--you know I've walked around in my bare feet, but I love walking around the property in my bare feet.  And, and not having to worry about stuff and things.
Story_ID: 5430
Speaker 1: Now, what do you feel-- , I mean you've talked some of  this,  in relation to how you were raised and how kids are  raised today.  But what are your hopes for our youth?
Speaker 2: I'm really worried about our children, very, very, worried.  Because if I had them I could make a difference.  But their parents have taken on the wrong priorities.  It's not about how many games, video games you have.  It's not about what kind of car.  We've taught our children to value BMW's and, and, stuff.  And if you saw that special the other night, our children are out of control.  I mean, you know, here we have a teenage club that's been on ABC that they have been showing where kids go, so they say, I don't know, to use the drugs.  You know, my kids had a curfew and my son was telling the kids up there tonight, today, how they had a curfew.  This thing at 11:00 [p.m.], "Do you know where your kids are?"  My kids had been in the house since sundown.  Even as teenagers, okay.  I just think I see kids today-- You go to high schools, it looks like a parking lot.  I mean, "Why should I succeed?  Hay! I've got a BMW in high school. I've got a Porsche in high school."  Or "I've got a Jaguar in high school."  But the--the children's parking lot has better cars in it than the teachers.  We've become a "things" society, and we've lost our children, all kids, black kids, white kids, pinstriped kids, polka-dot kids.  There's no connection.  Our children are disconnected.
Story_ID: 5431
Speaker 1: What do you think society needs to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we need to spend time--less time with stuff. And spend quality time with our children.
Speaker 1: And what are your-- What are your views about the future for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Our own children are emulating-- other children too.  It's you know, into the things, no honor anymore, no pride.  You know, I watch even with our own children here.  It's twice as hard for me now as it was when I started the school.  Because kids tend to talk back, because that's what they do with their parents. They have-- leave stacks of papers here.  And I couldn't wait to get home.  My children couldn't wait to get home to show me their graded papers.  You know I took a stack of papers like this out of many of the children's desks and the file cabinets in the hallway.  Parents are so busy that--you know that's the first question my children were asked.  "What did you do in school today?"  That's one reason I started my own school, because I knew what they were learning.  'cause I was on top of it every single day. Parents are busy with things that aren't important.  You know we talk about it takes two parents working.  But if we would cut out some of the stuff, maybe mom wouldn't have to work as long or as much.  You know kids--if you watch the trends, watch the designer catalog for babies and children's clothing today.  Even for dogs.  You know there's dogs' designer sweaters, and and children's designer clothing,children wearing [Tommy] Hilfiger designer baby things.  It's all about stuff.  And yet we're blowing up inside, because until you get the inside right, everything you put on the outside is just façade.
Story_ID: 5432
Speaker 1: And there are a lot of theories, educational theories, out there about how to best teach children. and we're in the Internet thing.
Speaker 2: Well that's just the thing.  Everybody can't agree on what's best.  I'm very old fashioned.  You can be on the Internet all you want.  But we do need to humanly be in contact.  Look at the average family. Mom goes to work.  You turn the radio on in the car, you sit in the back, and it's "Be quiet, shut up, don't do that."  Mom turns on her radio or either the kid tells you what station they want to hear.  It depends on the age.  So you get to school, have a good day.  Mom, dad goes to work.  You get home in the afternoon, the kid turns on (stressed) their television set, their telephone.  Or they get on the computer on the Internet.  And then you grab something to eat.  And you say what's for dinner and you say they say pew I don't like that.  So the child pops something in the microwave and gets on the Internet, or gets on the telephone.  We have so much difficulty now trying to keep some of the kids awake during the day, because they have their own TV, their own phone.  And so you know they watch these movies whenever they like.  So now the whole week has gone by and how many hours have we actually spent as a family talking?  Just talking.  And that's for all children.  African American children, all children are in trouble and disconnected.  You heard the one comment on that show the other night.  You wouldn't expect this from children in (unclear).  You know, but again, it's all children today.  Society is in trouble.  It's all about "stuff and things".  And who spent--  If I, if I hear once more, and I don't watch television but somebody else watches it:  How much this movie star spent on vacation.  Who cares?  How many houses they have, where they live?  So, you have a house on four continents.  You can only live in one at a time.  It's about acquisition.  You know who paid what at the Academy Awards?  How much the outfit cost?  Who cares?  You know, I can look just as good in something from T. J. Maxx  [discount clothing retailer] if I choose to.  As someone who buys a designer outfit. It's all about, I think, they need self-esteem.
Story_ID: 5433
Speaker 1: 'Cause they expect--you know, that I still lived on the West side for thirty something years.  Could have moved anywhere I wanted to.  But that's what I mean by a good sense of self though, and who you are.  You know, because our people just don't--they don't get the two, (pause) get  the connection.  It's so funny to watch their reaction.  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Well that's true. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: No, If you think about--
Speaker 2: It's two worlds.  They think it's two worlds.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's, it's a whole two worlds.  Because we were very fortunate to get one of the largest pieces of property there [referring to home in Hilton Head, South Carolina].  Because property is so expensive there and people are lucky if they can get one lot.  You know, so that house is kind of the talk of the island.  And yet you live on the West Side of Chicago.  But that's what I mean when I say I am comfortable wherever I am.  If it's a trailer, you know, I bring the peace and happiness there not the thing.  And that's really what I try to teach the kids.  Because I don't have to have those things to find peace, because I take it with me.  And that's been what I've sought all my life.  If the house goes tomorrow, I'm still wonderful.
Story_ID: 5434
Speaker 1: I think  life to me is kind of like a book.  You know, there are so many chapters.  And we fool around putting off reading it.  And we never finish reading the book.  It's how I run my life. I, I, took over two of the lowest achievement public schools here in Chicago [Illinois].  Got them off probation in just three months.  I wanted to go back to where I had left. You don't read the positive things, of course, nobody even mentioned that.  And I asked for two of the worst achieving schools and they had to be on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois].  And they had to be the lowest of the ones on probation.  Right now I am using this part of my life to do public schools.  I'm doing as I say, Quincy [referring to the Chicago Public school?] is one of the poorest areas in the United States.  Those schools have done so well,  I just had a wonderful letter from  [Florida governor] Jeb Bush and testified before the Florida senate as to how well they are doing.  I'm getting ready to do some public schools in Arkansas.  We have done a-- put our methodology into a public school in York, Pennsylvania.  We have done a public school in Springfield Massachusetts.  We have a school in Cincinnati [Ohio].  We've done a public school in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  We have a school in Milwaukee, Wisconsin [2005 update- the Wisconsin school is no longer affiliated with Marva Collins].  Right now this last part of my life is going to be geared towards putting my methodology into public schools.

Speaker 1: What do you want to prove by that point?
Speaker 2: I don't want to prove anything to people.  I really feel-- again spiritually, I feel this is what God meant for me to do.  I listen to the things that I think God wants me to do.  My prayer here every morning all the way to this school is God, help me to fulfill the destiny, the place that you meant for me to be.  Help me to do the things that you put me on this earth to do.  I believe that we were all sent here to do certain things.  I think we don't do them because we follow our own wills.  I mean were--  I tell the kids "God's trying to talk to us and show us success.  But we're so busy with the TV and the fax [machine], and the this, and the that.  So God can never catch you home." You know He can never get your attention.

Speaker 1: There are days when-- That's again what I love about the property in South Carolina.  That I might spend a whole day sitting on that boat dock just thinking with nothing.  No book, no nothing I just sit and think.  What--why am I here?  What am I supposed to do? As I say, life to me is like a book, you're given so many chapters.  How many of us have started a book and never finished it? You know, I'll say Tom Wolfe's "A Man in Full" is an indication of that 700 somethin' pages.  Most people started it. My own dear bright husband-- 'cause I usually give him a reading list of books that I think he might enjoy reading.  He started that book and got half way, I finished it in two days.  I believe we procrastinate.  We put off and then it's all over.  I want to be sure when my life is over, I have done the things I want to do.  Right now if I go today, I have done all the things with my life that I said I would do.  Everything I kind of do now is a re-run.  It's really-- I had--I did with my life what I intended to do ten years ago.  Everything I do right now is really a re-run. You know, it's If I go--some people are so afraid of dying.  You know, they--I think because I try to think good thoughts, I'm practicing.  I make myself practice doing something positive, something good everyday.  If I get a negative thought, you know I will hit my head and say, "Take it away Marva.Negative."  And this is the kind of talk I kind of do to my self.  In the mornings here I love--my husband and I spend a lot of time together, but I love kind of driving alone here because I can turn the televi--the radio off.  And I can just really kind of talk out aloud.  You know, "God help me today.  Be sure that I stay in the path that you meant for me to do."  and that's what I tell every teacher here.  I was sent to do what I do.  You were hired to do it, there's a grave difference.  But I can not let you deviate too much from what I was sent to do.  I hired you to help me carry on a mission, but I have a real mission.  I don't prove anything to anybody, I have to prove it to me.  I have to put my head on that pillow at night.  I live by a verse from Victor Hugo that I repeat constantly, "Give me patience for the small things of life, give me courage for the great troubles of life.  Help me to do my work and go to sleep knowing that God is awake."  I want to put my head on that pillow and not hate the things, the bad things that I've done.  You know, I list my own--I make a list of all the good things I've done in life.  I keep at least--it's going to take--if they read them, it will take my children twenty years just to read all of my journals.  But I often list the things I like about me.  You know, the things, the good things that I've done. And it's--I do it for me.  It's a passion.  I don't know why but it's a passion for me to do good.

Speaker 1: What do you want, and maybe you've answered this question.  What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I hope that these schools will be--well already my legacy is  I meet kids all over the country who say, "I became a teacher because of you." I am lucky that I hear some of my legacy while I'm still here. I receive letters from kids from all over the country saying, "I was Marva Collins at church during the black history play."  "I was Marva Collins at school during the black history thing." "Because of you I wanted to be a teacher."  Young kids especially all over the country tell me ,"I admire you so much."  I hope that these schools--  I hope this school will be here 200 years from now.  I hope like Mary McCleod Bethune, kids who don't know who Marva Collins is, will say, "There lived a woman named Marva Collins, who believed that all children were born achievers."  That's as simple as I can say it.

Speaker 1: What are your hopes for the African American family?
Speaker 2: I hope that parents will discover that many of the things that we give our children--you know, all kids need to know is that "I'm loved, that I am special."  They don't need a lot of keeping up with the Joneses.  A baby is as happy with a pot, and a spoon, and you being on the floor playing with them than they are all these toys that we buy them.  A baby is as happy with a cardboard box put in buttons, put in two buttons, put in six buttons, playing a game with them. Put in household objects in the box and then putting a top on the box.  And see from memory-- recall from memory all the things that I have put in.  Just spending time talking to children--children just love to be around me.  They ring the doorbell (unclear).  And I'm--we're the only blacks in the area but little kids will ring the doorbell and say to my husband, "Can Mrs. Collins come out to play?"  You know, kids, kids are drawn to me. For some reason you know, they just--wherever I am they are. And that's why I know this is what I was supposed to do.  You know, I was in Greece, and we were taking a boat trip.  And there was a little girl, she di--I didn't speak Greek, she didn't speak English. And she kept looking at me.  And I'd smile at her and she'd smile back.  That's the only communication we had.  She was eating a bag of chips, and she kept moving and moving and moving until she got right next to me.  And she took the bag and put it over for me to take one, and smiled.  All we could do was eat chips and smile at each other.  That was our communication.  But I get along so well with all children.
Story_ID: 5439
Speaker 1: There's a naughty little boy here, who gives every teacher so much difficulty.  His mom died, he's seven, and he's being reared by his dad.  And sometimes he just has a crying jags-- those are spells-- for no reason.  And, and can be very, very, aggravating if you're not patient.  But yesterday, those little butterflies that you put on your skin, he had a pack of butterflies.  And I said, "May I have one?" I put one on my face, and a matching one on his face.  And I says, "You know, we're butterfly friends.  Now that means you're gonna help make all good choices today.  Because we are now friends, because we have the same butterflies."  And when I came back today--when I took a shower, of course, I washed my face.  I forgot to put the butterfly back.  And he was almost in--he said, "Mrs. Collins you're not my butterfly friend anymore?"  And, you know, I asked him to bring me another one.  Because I told him, "Mrs. Collins is so sorry, but when I took a bath I forgot to put it back on."  And that kid behaved.  But just simple things that I say to kids that other teachers don't think of.  You know, and teachers will say to kids, "This isn't Marva Collins.  Don't come in here with that Marva Collins mess.  Because I'm not gonna put up with your junk."  But it's, it's seeing that only by the grace of God this could be my child. I talked to the dad this morning who was fussing at the kid.  And poor guy, he's raising his child.  And I says, "You know dad, it must not be easy.  I don't know what its like because I've never-- My mom is still alive."  I says, "His acting out isn't being bad.  His acting out I believe is saying,"I miss my mom, I'm sad."  And I says, "We just have to be patient."  And that kid finds me wherever I am.  You know, wherever I am he is around me.  And I think sometimes we react to--  I don't believe there are any bad kids.  I believe there are kids that are hurting.

Speaker 1: Now, what--is there  any person that you would say or persons who've influenced you?
Speaker 2: My grandfather and my family.
Story_ID: 5441
Speaker 1: I think the Harlem Renaissance period.  I mean to read those writings and see the vocabulary.  To see how they used words and to see the recidivism of African Americans today with libraries, computers.  Something is drastically wrong.  You know I say to our children, "If the slaves could learn to read by scratching in the dirt,"  Frederick Douglass, you know, "don't bring me that, you can't be great."  I mean you have computers, you have pencils you have all these great things.  But I, I think how we think, You know, "As a man thinketh so we are." And I think that's the period that, you know, I would tremendously have lived--really liked to have met with, you, know,  [W.E.B] DuBois and, and, just that period.

Speaker 1: What  What is the Marva Collins creed?
Speaker 2: Well part-- It's very lengthy but: "I have the right to fail, but I do not have the right to take my teacher and other people with me.  God made me the captain of one life, my own.  Therefore, if I choose to fail, that is my right.  But I do not have the right to take my teacher, my parents and other people with me." And that's just bits and parts of it.  But, "Life will always maroon the hesitant, but inspire the brave."  I can swiftly--I shall stand up and shout.  This is my time, my place.  I can either take that place or let others make my decisions for me. God is not some cosmic bellboy that comes at my beck and call. If I want to achieve the first step must be my own undertaking." And it goes on and on and on.  But it's--there are about 200 "I's" in that creed. Because everything I do is about me. the children happen to benefit.  But it's my excellence, it belongs to me.  I share it with them.  But everything I do is about me.  Because I teach people how to treat me.  You know, I can be in an airport where people don't know me.  And when my husband and I walk up to the counter, they would say, "You two are the last of the champagne group."  Or, "I don't know who you are, but I can tell there's something special about you."  And we get upgraded even though we have coach tickets.  And I can't tell you how many times that has happened.
Story_ID: 5443
Speaker 1: You've talked, about religion and its--not religion you've talked about faith a lot.  So I would like to know what, what, role faith has played in your life?
Speaker 2: Well if you were talking to my husband, he would give you a big laugh and say, "Marva thinks that--." You know my, my motto is that you take the "T" from can't and you have "I can."  I don't believe that there are a lot of things that I can't do.  I really do not--you know, as I said to you, the house I bought in Hilton Head [South Carolina] was a house I couldn't afford.  Kept it for three years.  Sold it for four times more than I paid for it.  Which--the house that I purchased from that house had been on the market for four years.  Nobody wanted it, now it's the talk of the town.  There were weeds everywhere.  I worked out there until 4:00 and 5:00 in the morning.  Of all the houses in Hilton Head it was one of ten that was selected to be on the yard tour. I just believe that if I work hard enough, I can do anything.  And the more you say it can't be done, that's a real challenge for me.  My husband says, "If you want something done, you'll say 'Marva leap from that building'."  He says, "Whatever  you don't want done that's exactly what I will do."  Anything you tell me can't be done--the naughtiest child in the world is my greatest challenge.  'Cause anyone can work with the bright children.  Anyone.  I mean my grandchildren, you know, they are surrounded by my daughter-in-law, my son, aunt Cindy, uncle Patrick, grandma Marva.  They have everything they need and a lot of the things they want.  They were-- their parents packed books.  My daughter, who just had this baby, the first thing she did when they put that baby in her arms she packed a book.  She read to that baby, she reads everyday to this three-week old baby.  My grandchildren are like third and fourth grade and they score like seventh and eighth grade, they love to read.  When they get in the car and we're going places, they always have a stack of books. My challenge is a child that no one believes can succeed, that no one wants to be bothered with.  They get on your last nerve.  You have to go out and say a prayer sometimes 'cause you want to choke them real slowly.  But it's momentary, okay.  Because I come right back again.  I'll say to a child in my moment of frust--"I don't care what you do, just do whatever you'd like." And then five minutes later I'll say, "I changed my mind.  I do care, you're gonna learn or you're gonna die. Now take your choice."  But it's a passion for me to see people succeed. It's a real-- to share that passion with other people.  That you really can achieve what ever you'd like to achieve.
Story_ID: 5444
Speaker 1: That you really can achieve what ever you'd like to achieve.  I mean like I say with that house, now we've had to put a gate there to keep people out.  To keep the, the, tourist and the gawkers out.  I mean everybody-- This is the same old sad house that looked like it was crying, that nobody wanted.  All I did was went in and gave it some lots of love, and lots of care, and that kind of thing.  I trimmed trees.  In fact one day I was so exuberant, a branch went in this eye.  And, and, it was all red but--  I trimmed trees.  And the yard guy said, "You know, you're the only person on this Island that gets out here and works with us.  You know, and like I say, when the yard tour was.  People actually didn't believe it.  Because we had like for-- It was for a church benefit, and we had like three thousand people come through the yard.  And it was so exciting to see people go, and know they're watching your creation.  And they would ask my husband, "Your wife didn't really put out all these flowers did she?"  They actually thought I was lying.  But I crawled on my knees out there.  And while I was there, I said a poem I taught the children.  "The man who wants a garden fair, with flowers growing in between, whether small or very big, must bend his back and dig."  And I just kept saying (chuckle) that as I'm putting out all these plants.  But just in one day, I put out a thousand plants on my knees.  But see, I'm very determined.  Just one more will do it Marva, just five more will do it.  And I'll look to the end and I'm so tired.  And all this perspiration is coming, and my knees are all muddy.  And, but-- I look down the long row and I say just five more will do it, just ten more will do it.  But I push, and I push, and I push.  And then I walk out and say "Look at what you created."  I don't want to say, "Look at what the yard-man created."  The beauty to me is to see that garden, the shade garden, the vegetable garden.  And know--I look at what you did.  See when somebody else does it for you it really does not enhance your-- to me it doesn't enhance my self esteem.
