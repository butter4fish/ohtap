Speaker 2: Okay, I'm [HistoryMaker] Orlando Bagwell, O-R-L-A-N-D-O, B-A-G-W-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Fantastic. Today's date is December 17th, 2007. What is the location of this interview?
Speaker 2: This interview is taking place at the Ford Foundation. Unfortunately, I hear, some sort of a power drill outside (laughter) as well. So I don't know if that's hurting you, but we're at the Ford Foundation in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And what's your occupation, or perhaps your present occupation and your career occupation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, well, I'm, I'm--my career occupation, I'm a filmmaker, documentary filmmaker, a filmmaker really. I don't just limit it to documentary. And I'm now working at the Ford Foundation. I'm the director of the media, arts and culture unit at the Ford Foundation.

Speaker 1: So before we start your interview, I wanted to talk a little bit about St. Clair Bourne. He's a very important documentary filmmaker who we lost this weekend. And I wondered if you might comment on who he is and why he's important?
Speaker 2: Well, St. Clair Bourne was, is--he's passed away, you know, this weekend. And he's a young man, and we were all expecting many more years of work and camaraderie and, you know, his pressing that we always do our best, you know, especially as African American, black filmmakers, that we had a responsibility to do our best and to, to constantly explore the meaning of ourselves for our work. He was the great networker. He was a person that seemed to know everyone and wanted to try and introduce you and make sure that you were connected to everyone. And he spent a lot of time and effort making that happen for all of us. So in many ways, we're gonna--we miss him, and we'll probably miss, hopefully we won't miss each other because he's gone because he was the, he was the person who brought us all together in so many different ways. But I think he's--St. Clair is like a giant in our world of documentary filmmaking, I mean especially if you're a young or an exper- or an old documentary filmmaker. You know, I think of myself as one of the elders now (laughter), you know. And it's hard to believe that when you feel like you do the work that you love and time goes by very fast. And I remember St. Clair when I was in college [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts]. He was a young filmmaker at the time, but he had credits, and he was making movies. And he was doing the kind of work that I wanted to do. He seemed to have a very strong, you know, kind of commitment to the stories of black people. And, and I felt that, from his early work and the kind of reputation he had as a young filmmaker that his commitment to that ki- to giving voice to our true stories, our true selves, working the nonfiction world to create honest stories of black people in the black community was something that I wanted to do as well. So early in my career, I didn't--our paths didn't cross, but, you know, somewhere around midway, you know, maybe in my mid-thirties I was out on a shoot. And I think I was in Massachusetts or, or Rhode Island in a restaurant. And there's St. Clair. And he was on a shoot as well. We were out, both, you know, in the middle of filming. And I was working as a cameraman then. And it was my first opportunity to meet him. And he was, and he, you know, when you meet St. Clair, it's like he's known you all your life, you know. And we had one of those kind of, kind of conversations among brothers. And we realized there was so much that we shared. But he, that's the kind of relationship I think everyone had with him. And he was always available, always, you know, encouraging in terms of your work, always knew your work, always knew about you and seemed to, to believe that it was important for all of us to kind of stay in the work. That was, that we had to kind of nurture one another to do our best work. And I always appreciated him for that. I'm gonna miss him a lot, a lot.

Speaker 1: We'd like to start the interview with five, what we call People magazine type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I'll just throw the question out, and you can answer with whatever comes to mind. What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Sweet potatoes.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Spring and fall.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite vacation destination?

Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase? Wow, that's a good one. It will probably come up in the interview (laughter). You'll probably know it by the time, by the time we finish the interview. It's probably like, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 485201
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mom. What's your mom's name? Where was she born, if you know anything about where she grew up and, you know, perhaps if she told you any stories about what that was like?
Speaker 2: My mom's name is Barbara Valentine Jones. She became Barbara Valentine Jones Bagwell [Barbara Jones Bagwell]. My mother is the oldest of four children--five children. She grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. Her parents were simple people. Her father was half Cherokee?
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Orlando [Orlando Jones]. His mother was full Cherokee. Most of his brothers and sisters were full. I realized that I met them later in life and began to understand the family (unclear). His mother was an urban Indian [Native American], had him last. He was the youngest, kind of quiet man. Her mother was, has a much longer lineage in terms of her mother and my great-grandmother who was still alive when I was born. Well, my great-great-grandmother was still alive when I was born. She died at 105. But that side of the family has a lot of different kind of American experiences, you know, part, you know, African American, Irish. And in some way, we have a direct line to President Buchanan [President James Buchanan, Jr.] in some way, which I don't really wanna explore too deeply, but it's a direct line. It was written in my great-grandmother's--when she turned 100, they did a story about her in the American- Afro-American newspaper [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers] in Baltimore. And they talked about this direct line and her mixed race background. And a lot of her children and daughters, many daughters, you know, were--some even passed, you know.
Speaker 1: What's your great-grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: It's interesting. I know it's Grandma Sampson [Alice Sampson]. My great-grandmother's name was Estella Hawkins [Estella Sampson Hawkins]. My great-grandmother--great-great-grandmother's last name was Sampson.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother's name was Estella?
Speaker 2: No, my great-grandmother's name is Estella Hawkins. My grandmother's name was Thelma Jones [Thelma Hawkins Jones].
Speaker 1: And you said your great--
Speaker 2: Great-grandmother's name was--
Speaker 1: Great-great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: --Sampson, the last name was Sampson. Her first name, I can't think of her first name right now. But she's the one who died at 105 when I was in about two or three.
Speaker 1: And do you know anything about Ms. Sampson's life and times?
Speaker 2: Only that, you know, that she had a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As a youngster, I mean not, perhaps (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Not, not in great detail. That's something that I don't know that much about. I know that my great-grandmother, and all of my, the women in my family really started having children young, I guess. You know, at that time, it might not be perceived as young, but they were, you know, in late teens and early twenties. My mother started having her first child, had her first child at nineteen, had three by the time she was twenty-two, had five by the time she was twenty-eight. And that was similar to my grandmother and--although my grandmother had her last child when she was forty. But she had four children very quickly, started young. My great-grandmother, same way, almost had them the same way.
Speaker 1: And are they all living in the Virginia and Baltimore area?
Speaker 2: Well, most of all, most those people are passed now. My mother now lives in California. My grandmother has passed. My great-grandmother has passed, but they all lived in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I meant when they did live (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They all lived in Baltimore, yes, they all lived in Baltimore.
Story_ID: 485202
Speaker 1: On my father's side of the family, and then this is kind of surprising. My father was an orphan. Both his parents died of leukemia--of tuberculosis, tuberculosis when he was young, within months of one another. So he spent some time in an orphanage, then was taken in by his uncle [Isaac Bagwell] and raised by his uncle and his wife [Phyllis Bagwell], he and his brother [Leon Bagwell]. But then I found, it was interesting, while I was making a film, actually, when I was making 'Africans' ['Africans in America: America's Journey through Slavery'], I was in the Eastern Shore of Maryland, down on the, in the Virginia, at the edge of the peninsula [Delmarva Peninsula], you're in Virginia. So I'm Accomack County of Virginia. And, you know, Accomack County in that part of the country, in the Civil War, they didn't destroy their records 'cause they never crossed over to invade that part of--that's part of the South, but the northern soldiers never got there 'cause you had to come all the way up and down Maryland to get there. That's why the Eastern Shore stayed intact for so long. That's where Frederick Douglass came from and Harriet Tubman and all those people came from the Eastern Shore. Henry Highland Garnet, a lot of, you know, famous free blacks that escaped came from the Eastern Shore. But my father--I was there doing research on the earliest African recorded in the, in history from that part of the--and he came from Accomack County. And I was there with a local historian. She says, "You're Bagwell [HistoryMaker Orlando Bagwell]? You're from around here, right?" And I said, "No, my father's from Baltimore [Maryland]. I never knew my family." She said, "Well, all the Bagwells live down on land, just not far from here. They're all from around here." And I noticed while I was there, it's the first time I'd seen even Bagwell, and there was a Colonel Bagwell that had a statue, a Civil War colonel. And so I went over there, and they were still--a lot of my family were still working the land there, and went and looked in the, the records and realized my family and my father's family goes back into the, you know, the--well, we were able to trace it back into the early 1800s, into the late 1700s. So, and, you know, the--that was the first settled area of the country. So it's possible my family, my father's side could go back quite far to that part. My father didn't even know about this himself, you know. So that was kind of like, say, one of those side, you know, one of those extra (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What's your father's name?
Speaker 1: His name is Donald Wesley Bagwell, Sr. [Donald Bagwell, Sr.]. And he lives in Florida now.
Story_ID: 485203
Speaker 1: So you said your great--great-great-grandmother [Alice Sampson] died when you were just a small boy but that your great-grandmother was also living--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and she took care of us when we were young (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Estella Hawkins [Estella Sampson Hawkins].
Speaker 2: --and spent a lot of time with the family, used to walk us to school and walk us home, buy us sweet rolls on the way home. We, we terrorized her because at that time, she must have been, I would imagine she was, Mama Estella died--she must have been sixties. But she stayed, she would stay--because my, you know, my, both my parents were--by the time, when they moved to--well, after they had five kids, they moved from the east side of Baltimore [Maryland] to--or west side of Baltimore to northeast side, closer to Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] because they went back to college. My father [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] hadn't finished high school. My mother [Barbara Jones Bagwell] dropped out of school at, in her first year. And they decided to go back to college and get their degrees when were, after having their first, their five kids. They were twenty-nine years old. And so we watched them go through college. But, so my grandmother, my great-grandmother would come spent maybe a year or two in our house and taking care, you know, helping my parents, you know.
Speaker 1: Did she tell you anything about her childhood in Baltimore? Did she ever tell you any stories?
Speaker 2: Well, stories mainly were, at that time, were really about how, you know, the nature of the family itself. You know, we had a very close family. So, I mean our families in a way were, every 4th of July, we all spent the 4th altogether. We, there were so many of us, we played baseball together. So we had two teams that was our family, kids and adults, you know. We didn't need, you know, we partied together. We spent--and that was like one holiday, but we did lots of times like that. Our family was like a, a very close family because, you know, it seemed like five was the big number. Everybody had five kids, and you start multiplying that, and you have lots and lots and lots of cousins and aunts and uncles. And, you know, my--the interesting side, thing about my family is that I had, like some of my great-grandmother's sisters, you know, they were well educated. You know, I can remember going to their houses and Aunt Sarah [Sarah Sampson] and Aunt Ethel [ph.] and Aunt Sally [ph.], they were all, they lived in a house together and Aunt Sarah was the one who was an educator. And she would travel a lot. And we would go, and she'd show us slides. That's how I really got to see the rest of the world, really, was through my aunt. We'd sit there, and she'd show us slide shows, on this old slide projector of the countries that she visited and narrate the stories for us, the countries and what she saw and what we were looking at on the screen. And then we would sing her songs, and then she would give us a Hershey bar, and that would be one of the best visits we'd have. You know, it was like we always looked forward to going to her house. So, and I realized they always had a real fondness for my mother. My mother was a very, very smart woman, and I guess one of the young girls that they felt was, you know, the future of the family in a sense, you know. I can imagine that they probably were very disappointed when my mother got pregnant and got married young and started having lots of children because they probably had big ideas and ambitions of their own for her, you know, in terms of what they expected her to be.
Story_ID: 485204
Speaker 1: And you said they lived together. So were they really career women as opposed to--
Speaker 2: Well, my Aunt Sarah [Sarah Sampson] was a career woman. Aunt Sally [ph.] and Aunt (unclear)--they had both, I think one--Aunt Sarah's husband died young. She didn't have any children. Aunt Sally had children, but she, her husband had died. You know, so they were kind of taking care of--they both at that time--Aunt Sarah was the youngest. And I don't feel that she was, you know, more than maybe ten, fifteen years older than my mother [Barbara Jones Bagwell]. You know, she seemed like a very young woman at that time when I was young, when I was a kid. Aunt Sally was older and Aunt Ethel [ph.] was much older. She was the oldest, eldest. I think Aunt Ethel outlived them all (laughter), yeah. And then on my father's [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] side, there was, again, even on my father's side, his Aunt Vie [ph.] was a school teacher, and we would visit her house in East Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland]. And she would, you know, read to us and make us read to her, you know, and challenge us. And my father was the same way. I think my, his family had lots of high expectations of him because he was a very good student in high school, very industrious, you know, for early on, always worked, you know; met my mother in high school, you know. But my father volunteered for the Second World War [World War II, WWII] when he was fifteen. And so he was underage, but he got in and drove supply lines, you know, in, in Europe. And he probably went in there, the end of the war. And then when he came out, he was called back in. And this is after he married and kids and went to Korea. So when I was born, my father was in Korea. But, you know, my parents, both my parents, I think were in the minds of my, probably their family, they were young kids who represented the future of the family in a sense, and their expectations of them were very high. And, you know, but you're carrying a lot of those expectations, but also the life you're living, and, you know, they weren't rich. None of my family was, was well off. We wouldn't call us middle class. We were really working class, and from my mother's parents [Thelma Hawkins Jones and Orlando Jones] side, they worked very hard and, you know, made ends meet. My father's side, his uncle was a chauffeur. And they lived off that one salary. I think his, his wife, Aunt Sarah, was, worked in a theater.
Story_ID: 485205
Speaker 1: Did your parents tell you how they met? You said they met in high school, but I mean do you have any details about their coming to, either their initial meeting or their coming to know each other?
Speaker 2: I think my mom [Barbara Jones Bagwell] was kind of a popular woman in school (unclear), and then my father [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] was, saw her from afar, you know. And I think they were friends for a while, and off and on dating, you know, gravitate away and back together, but never talked, you know, any detail about, you know, their courtship or anything like that, you know. I don't think that there was an expectation of having children at the time. I think for my mother, it was a way to get out of the house (laughter). I hate to say it that way, but I think in some sense it was about that. You know, it was like you, she was, she--my grandmother [Thelma Hawkins Jones] was a kind of controlling woman. And my mother was the eldest. And so she took care of brothers and sister. You know, it was like, it was interesting. It was a different time, and so, it was the--and we grew up, and our community was different. So everybody pitched in. Everyone was a part of raising family and taking care of family. And even as I grew up with my brothers and sisters because my parents went back to college [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], and, and worked at the same time, you know, we had very clear responsibilities in the house. And as I was a middle child, my sister [Janesta Bagwell] really was responsible for all of us. And we had, we came home, and we took care of--we had our jobs to do in the house. And, and part--and we had the, you know, we prepared own clothes and we dressed ourselves, washed our clothes, and, you know, we sometimes prepared our dinner and, you know, and prepared our breakfast and made our lunches for the next day, and, you know, did our jobs around the house and stuff like that. So you know you kind of all pitched in to kind of make it work because you're carrying a whole lot of--your day was full with lots of different, you know, your parents' days were full with work and school and all these things. They're trying to move ahead. You know, everybody's trying to make ends meet. And I remember even growing up, for us, we weren't well off kids or we didn't a good, you know, a rich--you know, my parents were, you know, working whatever jobs they could and trying to go to school at the same time. And so you can imagine what that life was like. It was fun for us as kids, but, you know, there were a lot of days there was no heat in the house, and we're making fun of what the, what might be in this soup we're eating. And we know there's not much in there, but a little bit, a taste, you know. So, carrying hard boiled eggs to school in the morning for lunch.
Story_ID: 485206
Speaker 1: It seemed like both your mother [Barbara Jones Bagwell] and your father [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] were academic, seemed to be academically strong, and seemed to have the interests of their families. Do you know anything about that decision to go back to Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --could you tell us what they studied?
Speaker 2: Well, it's probably two things. I think my father, because he served, was in the [U.S. military] service, he got the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]. So he could buy a house, and we moved out of a house that we were renting into a house that they bought. It seemed bigger than life at the time. When I go back to it now, and it's so small, you know. We all lived there, seven of us lived in this little place, you know. And, but it was ours, you know. And at the same time, they could, he could get help to go to school. My father was a, was, you know, he--when he came out of the service, he worked at the proving ground [Aberdeen Proving Ground] which is in Aberdeen [Maryland], outside of Baltimore [Maryland]. And, and I think he was able to do that because he, you know, he had skills and talent and was encouraged to follow up on that. My mother was also a good student, had aspirations of being more. They both did, you know, and, you know, it was evident just from the way the kind of conversations that was in my house, and how we spent our time around the table on Sunday talking and stuff, you know. So I don't think the idea of going back to school was such a foreign idea. The foreign idea was how do you do it and balance five children and support one another, one another to do it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then for both of them to go back.
Speaker 2: You know, when you realize when you hit twenty-eight, and you're thinking, okay, how long is it gonna take for us to finish and get through this. And then when I think about it, it took them about eight years to finish that. My mother now, my mother has Ph.D. and is a psychologist. My father is a physicist. You know, they were at, they ended up having pretty high, pretty strong careers after that. And many of--much of that decision to go back to school and to get their degrees then had a lot to do with how we end up living the rest of our lives. And, but the interesting thing about it is that, it didn't mean, it gave them more opportunity. I didn't necessarily mean it made our, made their struggle to take care of us as, you know, when you have a large family like that, much easier. It just gave them more options in order to do it. We did, you know, move away from Baltimore, and that was a response--it came out of the fact that my father had gotten a degree and was recruited and found, and people, people started to recruit him to work. And my mother also had more opportunities as well, and they took advantage of that.
Story_ID: 485207
Speaker 1: And did you think that, at the time it was unique for your, for your mother [Barbara Jones Bagwell] to return to school? I mean even now, it seems like in a lot of families that, you know, the roles are very traditional. So, you know, the woman will wait sort of or will take care of the family as the husband is being educated or because he's doing that. And it sounds like your whole family was well educated. So it might not be a question that really resonates with your experience, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, essentially, her parents were not, didn't have a college education. There are members of the family who did. My grandmother [Thelma Hawkins Jones] didn't finish college. My grandfather [Orlando Jones] didn't finish college. My father's [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] uncle didn't finish college. His wife didn't finish college. My father's parents hadn't finished college when they died. So it wasn't--there were members of the family who were educated, but wasn't necessarily directly related to, connected to their, their parents or grandparents. The interesting thing is that my, that it wasn't, it didn't--in my household, it was not, it wasn't--it didn't seem unusual for both my parents to go back to school. That if education was something for everyone, my parents made us as kids believe that. I have two sisters and two brothers, and we all felt that our, that education was something we all--it was good for all of us and that we would all go to college and that we would all, you know, that school was a key to the future. So it wasn't, didn't seem weird or unnatural for my mother and my father to be going back to school. The interesting thing, though, is that in going back, my father had more school to cover than my mother, that my mother could get jobs. She worked as a nurse's aide for a while, and then she worked as a school teacher in the elementary school in our neighborhood while she was going to college [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]. My father found it much, you know, after--he was working at Aberdeen [Aberdeen Proving Ground, Aberdeen, Maryland], but when he was working, taking full time, he went for a couple of years as full-time school, it was very difficult to find jobs. So he'd work odd and end jobs, you know, to kind of keep things together. So I mean, you know, I look back at it, and I think about, I'm a father now, and I know what it means to have, you know, children in the house, but to have five children, and to go to school full time, and then work, and then try and keep it all together and keep your kids together and keep them in school. And my parents, you know, even with all of the hardship, you know, the life we were living, and keeping it all together, they didn't send us to public schools. They sent us to Catholic schools and paid that tuition, you know. Catholic schools didn't give us free school (laughter) either. They paid the tuition to send us there. So, and, you know, you gotta be- you gotta wear uniforms. You gotta do all these things that become, you know, that are costly when you're living on a low budget. That means a lot so. You know, they worked, they believed in--that education was your key to--I don't mean that it was--but that was very much a part of the black community in general. I mean that didn't mean it was everyone, and I, growing up in Wilson Park [Baltimore, Maryland], you know, one of the things, where I lived, you know, you saw people getting evicted from their homes. You saw lots of families that were dysfunctional. But you saw, but you also had a very strong fiber of the community that was really about, you know, we were--each generation was improving on what the other had given them. You know, it wasn't that you were standing static or you were resting on what the last one had done. So that seemed natural that my mother and father both would go back to school together.
Story_ID: 485208
Speaker 1: Can you tell me your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, my earliest memory of growing is probably, I was living in the house that we moved to in Radnor [Avenue]--I was living in, McCulloh Street [Baltimore, Maryland], and my earliest memory is standing at the top of the stairs. We had a long stairs that led down to the front door and this man coming in the door. And I was thinking it was my father [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] because I, and I must have been very young because, you know, barely over one year old because my father was in Korea. I don't think I saw my father until I was two or something like that. And so I must have wanted to, I wanted him around and was aware that he wasn't around. So my earliest memories are in that house, and one of them is my uncle, it was really my Uncle Jimmy [ph.], who came to the house. He was on my father's side, visiting to make sure, you know, my mom [Barbara Jones Bagwell] and family was okay, you know, because we lived there alone. My father wasn't around. And other memories are with my, you know, getting chicken pox in that same house with my brothers and sisters and there being a housekeeper that took care of us, you know, and her taking care of me during that time. And my other one is swallowing a penny in the bathroom, my mother saving me. You know, I was choking me, and my mother saving me then (laughter), and falling down the steps with my brother, all in this house. And they are early memories, I know they're early memories 'cause I moved from that house at five; you know, getting stung by a bee in the backyard with a friend. His name, I remember was Chico [ph.]. I remember the marble steps we used to clean out in front of the house. But so, I think I was fortunate because I had two brothers and sisters and so much of my early years were really kind of following them around and being in their shadow. So they were impressionable and made impressions on me. But I do remember very strongly the, wanting my father to be home and hoping that this person at the door was my father.
Speaker 1: Did you have four siblings altogether?
Speaker 2: I have four siblings altogether. I'm the fifth. Yeah, there's five of us. I'm in the middle.
Speaker 1: Will you name, name the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My oldest sister's name Janesta [Janesta Bagwell] and that is the name of my father's mother.
Speaker 1: Would you spell it?
Speaker 2: J-A-N-E-S-T-A. My older brother is Donald, Jr. [Donald Bagwell, Jr.], and then me, Orlando [HistoryMaker Orlando Bagwell]. And then I have a younger brother, Brian [Brian Bagwell (ph.)], and a younger sister, Doreen [Doreen Bagwell (ph.)].
Story_ID: 485209
Speaker 1: So when you are in your life today, are there any sights and sounds and smells that remind you of being a kid, either in that house or in the next one that we're going to talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, there's, the sights, I can remember, we used to have this big freezer that was a floor freezer. I think someone gave it to us. You know, because we had so many kids, you know, you get gifts like that so that you can keep food, you know. And I remember that freezer very well 'cause it was so big. It sat in the between the kitchen and the living room. And the smells were like, my mother [Barbara Jones Bagwell] used to make, loved oysters. We lived in--in Baltimore [Maryland], you know, oysters were something you could get easily. And my mother loved oysters, but I hated 'em. And she would make fried oysters and oyster fritters and all these things, and I would try and figure out a way where I could--when she got up from the table, I could sneak throw the oysters behind the freezer (laughter). And she caught me one time and made me eat my oysters, and that was the worst thing that ever happened. It was like a big stand-off to my mother, and it happened in that old house, you know. It wasn't in the new house, you know. I can remember her frying oysters and just hating when that happened. I wanted to get out of the house someway. I can, I can remember my, the long hallway upstairs and there being a certain sense of fear as well as familiarity about it, you know, because it was long. It felt so big, but it probably wasn't that big, but I was so small. And I remember the front room that came off from the front door. You came in, and you came into the front room and how it was a, it was an old, like long house that, you know, that Baltimore has, very narrow. And they're long. It's a long, narrow--again, I was small so the house was probably much smaller than I imagined it. I remember, imagined it as being so big, and I remember this big backyard and probably all of it's very small in real life, you know. But for a little child, it was all very big, kind of dark.

Speaker 1: You mentioned that you lived in this house that was very long in Baltimore [Maryland], until you were about five.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Then, where did you move to?
Speaker 2: We moved to Radnor Avenue, 804 Radnor Avenue. It's in Wilson Park [Baltimore, Maryland]. It was, it's in, within walking distance of Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]. I used to walk there, I used to go swimming there on weekends in a swim program. So you could walk it. And our cousins lived close there. They lived up on The Alameda, so there was, there were four of them. And my mother's [Barbara Jones Bagwell], you know, second sister, so, you know, it was very nice. (Background noise) One second, sorry. Sorry.
Speaker 1: That's okay. Was your daily routine there, probably your chores picked up a bit since your parents are now in school, but could you describe what the day was like for you and your brothers and sisters, including some of those responsibilities and just what it was like?
Speaker 2: Well, we--my parents kind of ran a pretty strict house in the sense that, it wasn't, you know, like overtly strict or anything. But, you know, we went to bed every day around the same time, you know, around 8:30, 9:00. We got up early in the morning. We would bathe the night before, you know. We had dress, we'd prepare our--'cause you wore uniforms, we had to iron all our shirts and our pants, you know, over the weekend so we'd have 'em all ready for the next week, white shirt, blue pants, purple tie. We had to do our shoes, shine our shoes, stuff like that, you know. And we'd get up in the morning. We'd dress ourselves. My parents--my father [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] would leave early. So he'd wake us all up. My mother would get up with us. I would go out and--it's interesting 'cause I would go down and get my mom a cup of coffee and bring it up so she could get up, you know. We'd get dressed, eat our--we'd prepare our food in the morning, our lunch. (Background noise) Sorry. And we'd walk to school together. And the walk to school, not a short walk. It was, you know, a pretty good-sized walk. We walked together.
Speaker 1: Are you all in the same age range so that you're at least entering schools together (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, my three, my older brother [Donald Bagwell, Jr.] and sister [Janesta Bagwell] and I are within three years. We're within less than three years. So we were one year apart school wise and class--we started in the, we first went to the Catholic school [Blessed Sacrament School, Baltimore, Maryland]. And I was in second grade, my brother was in third, and my sister was in fourth. And then my younger brother [Brian Bagwell (ph.)] is three years behind me, so the by the time I was in fifth grade, he was starting first grade, and my--and they went to a eighth grade school. So by the time I was in, by the time my sister was in eighth grade, my younger sister [Doreen Bagwell (ph.)] started first grade. So we were all, at one point, we were all there, yes.
Story_ID: 485211
Speaker 1: And my cousins (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was the name of that first school?
Speaker 1: It's called Blessed Sacrament [Blessed Sacrament School, Baltimore, Maryland]. And my cousins went there too, and we were--other than maybe three other students, we were the only black students in the school. It was kind of a, you know, it was kind of a working-class, Irish Catholic school.
Speaker 2: Was there any tension due to the fact that you were the black kids?
Speaker 1: Are you kidding me? (Laughter) And Baltimore [Maryland] is a southern city. When we were going to school, segregation was still a part of Baltimore. It was so much a reality that our school went to a class trip each year, and because the amusement park was segregated, we couldn't go. They would want to send us to another park, I guess until my parents [Barbara Jones Bagwell and Donald Bagwell, Sr.] started making--my mother, and especially, my aunts, started making a lot of noise about that.
Speaker 2: So did they choose another park that everyone could go to (background noise)?
Speaker 1: And that was in school, but I mean there was still, you know, you're still also dealing with students who, you know, you know, you would get called names. And you would be the focus of lots of attention in terms of, you know, at times animosity. But I didn't, you know, it's like you--these are the things you live with, you know. You know, that are real, and you live with, you deal with, you know. You don't let it--in some way, we had strong families, you know, so you didn't let it define you as much as you negotiated it, to respond to where you had, the ways you had to respond in order to maintain your space and your dignity, and your, you know, and your respect (laughter), you know. And my brother [Donald Bagwell, Jr.] and I and my sister [Janesta Bagwell] and all of us, you know, kind of understood that very well. So that's what you grew up with, yeah.
Speaker 2: And how were the instructors there? Was there, is there anyone (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it's up and down. Some were good. Some instructors were good. Other instructors were, and there were nuns, most of 'em were nuns. But they were still, you know, from the nuns to the priests to the lay teachers, it was up and down. Some were very, you know, sensitive and aware and others were the product of where they came from. So that's the nature of what we were dealing with as well.
Speaker 2: Do any of them stand out in your mind?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had some, you know, I had ugly experiences in school.
Story_ID: 485212
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers who had a good impact, influence on you that you remember from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, essentially, we had, we had--when my sister [Janesta Bagwell] started, she started in fourth grade [at Blessed Sacrament School, Baltimore, Maryland]. That fourth grade teacher was probably all of our favorite teacher. She, she believed in us, and she encouraged us and she made us feel like we were an active, equal part of the classroom. I had a sister, a nun the next year who was an older nun, probably the oldest nun, in the fifth grade. She was tough, but she also treated you equally. So if you did good, she was gonna help you--she was gonna acknowledge you for what you did good. But she also had very rigid rules. And I remember I had very nice penmanship, writing, you know. And, but I had fallen in love with--I was, I always felt that I was a left-handed writer, but I started writing right. So I liked the way left handers wrote. So I started writing in a left-handed style, and it's like a slant backwards the other way. And in Catholic school, there's a certain slant you have to follow. And I remember I started writing that way, and my, my fifth grade teacher said to me, you know, you're doing very good in school, and you're getting great grades. But if you write that, if you write like that on your final exam, I'm giving you an F. And whew, I'm like, you're gonna give me an F for writing. So I wrote like that, and I got Fs (laughter), geography and history, I failed, and penmanship. My two penmanship grades I failed. And she taught me a good lesson (laughter). This was her classroom, and if she said she wanted it a certain way, that's the way it was supposed to be. And it wasn't a matter of whether I answered the questions right. She said, that's the way it was. I was ready for the test, and I knew I got--I did well on the test. But I got an F, and I got punished for the summer for it too because I was, you know, so--I appreciated her 'cause she taught me a good lesson, you know. And she was a good teacher. I learned a lot in her class. There are other teachers who were totally racists, did ugly things to you in classroom, created ugly scenes in the classroom for you, would hit you and do things that, as an example, then you had to kind of address that in the best way you could, you know. And sometimes it meant your mother, your parents had to come up and kind of let them know that they knew what was happening. Yet, some teachers would never give you a decent grade because they never thought you were capable of doing it. But I had parents [Barbara Jones Bagwell and Donald Bagwell, Sr.] who would help us understand, you know, be very confident about what we were capable of doing and not letting things like that, you know, affect our sense of what we could do, you know, and would talk us through it. You know, wanted to understand, help us understand that we were there because we were learning and that the alternative was going to a school where we weren't gonna get the same kind of opportunity to learn, and that we should just kind of hang in there and do our best.
Speaker 1: Did you have the opportunity to study with your parents and in the evenings, would it be all of you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can remember my parents giving us time to help us with projects and tests. And I think about it, when they're, they're studying and trying to get through school, and they're working, you know, and going to school [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and carrying full loads, and would find some time to work with us on our school work. I mean I have to admit, I felt, I felt fortunate as a child because like I had a very happy childhood, you know. We didn't have a lot, and we didn't, you know, we, we were--but you don't recognize those things as a child. What you recognize as a child is whether you're loved and whether you're respected. And I felt my parents did that. Now, I'm not gonna paint a perfect picture of our house there, you know. My parents were under a lot of stress. They fought a lot, you know. Eventually, they divorced later in life, but you could see the tension in the household. At times, it was very strong. When we got in trouble, you know, we could get hit, you know, and things like that. But it never created a--for me, a (background noise) it never impacted me in a way where I thought that I was damaged by it, that I thought that I was fortunate because I had a loving family and two parents that looked out for us. And I thought that was an advantage, especially when I looked at a lot of my friends living in the neighborhood [Wilson Park, Baltimore, Maryland] with me, you know. They didn't have the same kind of--at least that kind of support and that kind of step up that I felt my brothers and sisters and I had.
Story_ID: 485213
Speaker 1: You talked a little bit about the 4th of July and playing baseball.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What then was the second biggest holiday in your home and how did you celebrate it?
Speaker 2: Well, we had big, Thanksgiving was a big holiday every year because Thanksgiving was a big meal and a big--and a time when people came together around the table. And, you know, lots of guests would come in and Christmas (background noise)--
Speaker 1: We were talking about Thanksgiving. You were saying that was one of the holidays when--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) lots of people would come.
Speaker 2: Yes, there were, there were a couple of big holidays in my house growing up. Thanksgiving was a big holiday, lots of family would come over. It was a big table of people. My mother [Barbara Jones Bagwell] would cook everything. It was so funny. I probably watched her cook everything, so now I can create it by heart without even knowing the recipes, you know, watching her do it every year the same way.
Speaker 1: Could we just get a short list of what everything is? Sweet potato--
Speaker 2: Turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, macaroni and cheese, greens, string beans, sauerkraut, pies, you know, mincemeat pie, pumpkin pie, sweet potato pie, coconut cake, you know. She would just, so it could be--and people would bring things as well. So it was, you know, it was always, a day when you walked, you finished dinner and you were really full. You know, when you've got four brothers and sisters, most days you could get up and you don't feel too full 'cause you didn't move fast enough to get enough food, you know (laughter), but that day you felt really full. And that was a good day and Christmas. Christmas was the one day my parents would give us gifts, you know. It was when we got gifts. They didn't--we weren't a house where you got, parents would bring you in gifts every day or every other day, you know, on a regular basis other than you get a gift on your birthday and then Christmas, you'd get a few gifts, you know. And, so that was a big day too. So those were the two big holidays. We used to have--because my parents went back to school [at Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], our house was like an open house. You had so many like students in our house because my parents were like the older students, but they were still students. And they were still young, you know. And so then my parents had the parties in my, in our house. We had a basement, and people would come and party and come home from--we would go to church [Blessed Sacrament, Baltimore, Maryland] every Sunday. And I think my parents sent us to church so they could get a break (laughter), you know. We'd all go to church, and we'd come back, and there would be a household full of, you know, college students. They're all dancing in the hall, in the living room, playing music, and we'd start dancing with 'em, and it was a regular thing in my house. It was kind of a hang place for a lot of the students who, you know, who lived in the area, but also friends that my parents had made in their, you know, going to school and stuff.
Story_ID: 485214
Speaker 1: Where did you go to church, and who took you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we, because we went to Catholic school [Blessed Sacrament School, Baltimore, Maryland], we went to Catholic church. So we went to Blessed Sacrament [Baltimore, Maryland] to church, and, you know, when you go to Catholic school, you do all the things. You're, you go to--you join the choir. You're an altar boy. You'd be all these things that, you know, on you, and you kind of--because you take religion too. You know, you fall into all the religious, you know obligations. And church, Sunday Mass is an obligation, you know. The first Friday Mass is an obligation, high--you know, certain holidays in the year and the High Mass were obligations. And you're part of that scene, and all the kids in the school are in your--you know, it's funny. When you're a child in school, no matter where you go, you aspire, you know, for the same things that your colleagues and your classmates do, you know. So you join the Cub Scouts and the Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], and you join the altar boys, and you--you know anything. We couldn't play soccer. We played neighborhood football, my brother [Donald Bagwell, Jr.] and I, and neighborhood baseball. And that's when we hung out with, our friends from the neighborhood [Wilson Park, Baltimore, Maryland], is when we played football and baseball. And they were all neighborhood teams.
Story_ID: 485215
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in elementary slash junior high school [Blessed Sacrament School, Baltimore, Maryland], did you have a sense of what you were gonna do with your life?
Speaker 2: No, no. I think I (laughter), I changed a lot, from lots of different things, you know. I, I knew I was gonna continue school. I knew that I wanted to do, you know, one thing about Catholic school is that to get into high school, you have to take standardized, you have to take a standardized test to get in. So you're preparing early on to take what would be the high school equivalent, kind of SAT test, you know, taking these. And you're taking standardized tests all through, you know, your grade school because that's how you get placed in reading and math in your school and stuff as well. So, you get very used to that testing part, but you also realize it's your key to doing better, you know, or getting into schools you want and stuff. So, you know, I knew I wanted to go to school, had an idea of the schools I wanted to go to. What I wanted to be or anything, I hadn't really decided any of that. I think I was, because my father [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] was an engineer, you know, and my mother [Barbara Jones Bagwell] was a, was a psychologist, I think I was, you know, if you would a asked me back then, I was talking about, ah, I wanna be a lawyer or I wanna be a, you know, a doctor or I wanna be--you know, all the kind of cliche, you know, things we were--or an engineer. But it was all, did I know what they really did? Not really (laughter), you know. It just sounded, sounds very good, you know.
Story_ID: 485216
Speaker 1: So tell me a little bit about the conversation that went on in your house, maybe over the dinner table or on some of these holidays. Did you talk about what was happening in the world? Did you talk about politics while you were at home?
Speaker 2: Well, we talked a lot about politics. We talked a lot about presidential elections. We talked a lot about, you know, growing up, because I, you know, I was born in the '50s [1950s], and I grew up and I remember when John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] ran for president and how big a conversation that was at the dinner. He was a Catholic, number one, but also, you're talking about the emergence, the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement, Montgomery [Montgomery Bus Boycott] happens in '57 [sic.]. I'm young, but it's a conversation around my table, you know. Baltimore [Maryland] is a segregated city. It starts, the sit-ins start happening. The Freedom Rides, all those things are things that my parents are talking about. They're activists, you know. My father [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] was a community organizer in our neighborhood [Wilson Park, Baltimore, Maryland]. My mother [Barbara Jones Bagwell], you know, was interested in all that. It was part of the conversation we had at our table. So Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] spoke at my mother's commencement at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know. My mother tried to take me to see Malcolm X, but we couldn't get in, you know, when I was young. I didn't know who I was really going to see, but she wanted to see him, and she took me along with her. I mean all these in my father's side, and there's movie theaters we couldn't go to in our--that were just on the other side of our neighborhood, on the way to Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] really, and my parents were part of sitting in to make those places open, you know. And I knew this, you know, so all these things were things that we grew up with. This is the world, the kind of environment that we grew up in. You know, we weren't participating. We weren't marching. I remember we wanted to, to, you know, we left Baltimore--I mean it's interesting because I think we left, we left Baltimore in sixty--we left Baltimore in '65 [1965] or something like that, '65 [1965]. So we were there for the March on Washington. I remember wanting to go and my parents didn't take us because they were afraid it was gonna be vi- you know, there might be violence. And they didn't want us there, you know. But, you know, the Route 66 [U.S. Route 66], all this stuff going on and the Eastern Shore with, Gloria Richardson was involved in and people like that. That was all happening around, you know, my young, early years as a teenager. So, yeah, we were, I was very much aware of it, you know.
Story_ID: 485217
Speaker 1: You know, as you're growing up and your parents [Barbara Jones Bagwell and Donald Bagwell, Sr.] are active in the community and students from Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] are coming over, can you just talk a little bit about what the community was like, maybe not necessarily specifically stating but in contrast to what communities are like today?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's, in my, I mean our neighborhood [Wilson Park, Baltimore, Maryland] was, you know, we, when we moved in, we were the first--second black family on the block. Within a year, there were none--it was all-black. So you had people moving in who were trying to--they were moving because they wanted to move up, you know. They wanted to try and move to a nicer home, a nicer neighborhood. And my parents were very much involved with the neighborhood association. My father was--we'd go out and hand out flyers. That's how I knew because we were always (laugher), you know, every week we're walking, going up and down the street putting flyers in people's doors and stuff like that. And I said, I was a newspaper boy, and I sell news, you know, delivered newspapers to homes as well. And, you know, the community was tight. You knew lots of people. Everybody knew each other. And you couldn't get away with anything. My mother was a teacher in a school, you know. I knew all--she knew all the kids. They knew all--and they knew her. You know, Halloween, we'd open our house up, and all the kids would come in our house and come in our basement and hang out, you know. It was just like you knew everybody, you know. It didn't mean there wasn't, there weren't problems and people didn't have difficult times, but there was much--a great sense of camaraderie and a sense of community that we all grew up with. We'd barbeque together and hang, you know, hang out in our backyards together. And so that was different. You know, also my--because my parents were going to school, we had this larger community of students and stuff. And I watched my parents, my father pledge a fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] when I was ten, you know. And we'd go to football games up at Morgan all the time, homecoming every year. So all this was a part of the world we lived in as kids, you know. So it was very, you know--there was a sense of the black community being a, a friendly, safe place for me. It didn't mean that, you know, it didn't--we still had our turf things, you know, in terms of my neighborhood. And we had our colors, and we, you know, but we weren't--it wasn't the same thing as today. It wasn't, you know, as, it wasn't as violent and dangerous. There was a sense of, you know, we didn't lock our door, you know, and we were kids who were on their own in coming home from school and stuff like that. But we never carried keys with us. And our door was never locked.
Story_ID: 485218
Speaker 1: Would you say that the community was well informed?
Speaker 2: About (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You said you were passing out flyers, just about social and political issues? Would you say that, just as in your house where there was discussion about what was happening, did that happen on a grander scale also?
Speaker 2: I think that was the nature, that was the nature of the times. I mean, if you were in a black community, you were in touch with what was changing in America. And you wanted to be a part of that. I think if you go back and look at statistics during that time, crime was on an all-time low during that time because we were, we were preoccupied with other things. And our sense--this idea of community, this idea of partnership in something that was bigger than any one of us, I think everyone shared that; didn't mean we shared it all the same way or we were equally active in that or we politically agreed on issues, but there was a sense of change going on. And as a community, we all kind of were invested in that. And we're proud of it, you know. And you had models out there who were challenging us to be better, you know. You had King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], you had Malcolm [Malcolm X]. You had all these people. And it didn't mean that you were necessarily sure of all them, meaning Muhammad Ali, all these people that were, you know, so much a part of the 1960s and were calling--challenging you to reconsider yourself because I can remember even with Muhammad Ali and even Malcolm, it's these, you know, lots of ani- you know, ambivalence around, you know, their attitude and their presentation and how loud and vocal they were. But you realized, but at the same time, there's also a sense of, of a schizophrenic relationship with that because in some sense, you were very--it was what, in many ways, you saw people who would maybe challenge it, but all at the same time recognize that it was, it was--they were doing things that everyone wanted to be able to do but weren't quite ready to do yet, but were very, but in some way you were proud that they were doing it, although you weren't necessarily sure you could say that out loud because you didn't know whether in the long run it would come back to haunt you. But you could see it coming--that was all a part of what was changing at that time. I mean I grew up when, with my grandparents [Thelma Hawkins Jones and Orlando Jones], when you asked me earlier about my grandparents, nobody ever talked about slavery. Nobody wanted to even acknowledge that they, that their ancestors had been slaves. That was the interesting thing about my mother's [Barbara Jones Bagwell] side of the family and especially, you know, her mother's, my mother's mother's side and Grandma Sampson [Bagwell's great-great-grandmother, Alice Sampson]. They never wanted to acknowledge that they had had been slaves, you know, or that, you know, this whole thing of there was this proudness about President Buchanan [President James Buchanan, Jr.] but nobody's gonna talk about how that might be related, you know. You didn't have that. There was no conversation about that. It was something we didn't do. We weren't open. We weren't forward, we weren't confident as people. And all that was changing in the '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 485219
Speaker 1: That's one of the schizophrenic aspects of the '60s [1960s] in the black community. In one sense, we're very, very proud of the fact that we are taking our liberation in our own hands, that we are changing and being actively involved in changing what we know is wrong in America. But on the other side of it--(background noise) but on the other side of it, we're also keenly aware of the fact that it's gonna force us to acknowledge certain aspects of our past we don't wanna do and certain aspects of our past that are hurtful and painful. And that in some way, even in all the hurt and pain which maybe we had nothing to do with, we feel ashamed of. And you felt all that going on at the same time in, when you were living in the '60s [1960s] and going into the '70s [1970s]. That's why things got a little bit crazy even because we never, you know, it's like, it's heavy therapy there. But there was no therapy going on. There was no space for that kind of, really kind of deep soul searching around what it is that you're trying to purge and what are you trying to become, you know. And that thing is, that--and if you don't do that, then it gets a little bit confusing because it all gets mixed up in there. And some days, you're expressing enormous kind--joy and, and assertiveness and all that. And other days, you wake up and you're feeling angry, and you're feeling shameful and you're feeling--you know, and wondering where all this is coming from. And you start saying it's that person's, it's their fault. But it's really what's inherently what's inside, it's how we deal with conflict, with pain, with stress, with all these things that come with oppression and difficult, difficult pasts, you know, difficult encounters and situations that you have to live with and rationalize in order to keep going every day.
Speaker 2: With having a history of black people who have been hurt in lots of ways and who are, in part, ashamed of what's happened and a white community who doesn't necessarily want to acknowledge it, do you think that kind of therapy will ever happen?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, (unclear) I don't think it's about whether white people want to acknowledge it, in a sense. And let me tell you why, because in many ways, it's why I got into making movies. So I think that in some way, it's about a--no one, everyone doesn't move at the same time and at the same pace. But in order to become whole again, you have to acknowledge all the things that are, that you're struggling with inside. And the thing about it is that, for, when you're looking at history or histories, like the history of oppression in a sense, you know certain things are real. You know certain pains are real. You know certain things about shame are real. You know certain, certain ideas around rationalizing certain kind of indignities that you have to then rationalize and accept in order to just move on, and what that takes from you, that you lose something every time you do that. So one, you know, people ask me, well, why did you wanna make movies about history? Why you would--what are you digging for? Your films are kind of interesting, but it seems like you're--they're not really about, you know, just a person but other things. And I think it's all about that because I think that in many ways you want--if you're really helping people to understand, then you're investigating all of those things, that at the core, you're really trying to get deeper into those things that have never really been on the surface, never really been talked about. But there's so much there in how we say things, how we approach things, how we do things, how we act, and, and we wanna try and shed that. But it's not easy, and that we all struggle with that. And that's what makes us--the way I think it makes all of, you know, people's stories so interesting or a story about, you know, about black people so interesting, is that, that kind of complex reality is not something that we express openly. And, therefore, it is not something that wants to be acknowledged as a part of what we live with, you know. It's a sense that, okay, you can--we've decided that the gate is open and you can just walk through and become a new person. We don't become a new person that easily. It doesn't happen like that. You have all this other stuff that you're carrying with you, and you can't just kind of let it go at the door. It doesn't just disappear at the door. You carry it with you. And I think that's the whole reason for each generation to keep revisiting past because each generation, you shed a little bit more. You're a little bit more enlightened. You're a little bit more able to kind of understand and to talk about what's new and what you can really be, you know. Dragging that heavy weight with you, you're not gonna move too fast, you know. We're dragging a lot of past that's really deep and difficult and that has never been really resolved, even among ourselves, let alone, you know--
Speaker 2: The greater (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) talking with white America or whether they, they're--I mean that, they're carrying their own stuff. You know, and you see people trying to explore that as well. But I mean, you know, it's like, it's--you know, that's the, for me, that's the interesting side of history, you know, that we can celebrate the great events and the great victories and all, but all of it comes at a cost. And how do you--and the celebration is really when you've been able to kind of address the cost and that you feel like you've moved beyond that, you know, and that you become new because you've engaged that, you know.

Speaker 1: When you were growing up, did you all watch television, and if you did, what were you watching and what kind of music were you listening to?
Speaker 2: Well, we listened to much more music than we watched television. We had one TV in our house, and it was in my parents' [Barbara Jones Bagwell and Donald Bagwell, Sr.] room. And they would let us come in, and we'd sit down at the bottom of the bed and look up like this at the top bureau where the TV was and watch TV, you know. So we didn't watch a lot of TV growing up. It's interesting that I became a filmmaker because I didn't watch a lot of TV. And I didn't go to a lot of movies. I went, my, my earliest experience of movies is my mother did take--liked movies, and for some reason, she would take me to movies. I guess she realized when we went to drive-ins, I was the one who stayed up all the time, watched everything. So she felt that I must have been into it. But we listened to music, like I mean I grew up on Motown. I listened to all the great radio stations that were black radio stations in Baltimore [Maryland], Fat Daddy [Paul "Fat Daddy" Johnson], like Larry Dean, you know, all those poets, you know, on the radio and the music. And, you know, and my parents were young. So they were into music, the music too. So, you know, dancing and music and all that stuff was--that's how we spent our day. And, you know, we would, because there's five of us, we could almost become any music group out there, you know. So we would be The Supremes one day and play all the parts, and then The Temptations another day and do all the steps and Four Tops. You name it. We knew all the Motown [Motown Records] songs, and that's what we grew up on, and that was a good part.
Story_ID: 485221
Speaker 1: And then just a little bit more of your extracurricular. You said that you played football and that there were neighborhood leagues. What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, that was, that was when I could hang with my boys, you know. That's where I made all my good friends that ultimately became the guys I used to hang out with all the time and the rec center [recreation center], and you know, when I went out and started going to parties and stuff like that, you know. We started playing football and had football, neighborhood football teams starting at ten years old for me and, and went all the way up until we were fourteen, my brother [Donald Bagwell, Jr.], and then we went on and played high school ball, stuff like that. But then we moved on and started playing in other space. We didn't have a team like that in grade school [Blessed Sacrament School, Baltimore, Maryland]. It was only a soccer team, and so my brother and I played in the neighborhood football team and neighborhood baseball team, didn't grow up playing basketball, very interesting. Those two sports kind of occupied my time. And it was like a social event. You had the all--my parents [Barbara Jones Bagwell and Donald Bagwell, Sr.], we had a station wagon. And so my parents would go to every game. We'd load up the car with all the football players, and then we can get in and we drive to games. And there was a certain group of parents who were always there, would always be, you know, bringing water and food for the team, and, you know. The first year we lost every game, and the next year we won the championship. You know, we were, we were--Wilson Park [Baltimore, Maryland] was a, was a real team.
Story_ID: 485222
Speaker 1: You said that college expanded your parents' [Barbara Jones Bagwell and Donald Bagwell, Sr.] opportunities and that as a result, your dad was recruited and that you moved to New Hampshire?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about that and--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that's how I remember it from a perspective of a child. I think that, you know, we--my father, when I think about it, actually, my father finished school [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], he must have finished school in '63 [1963], '62 [1962], '63 [1963], maybe '62 [1962], '61 [1961], '62 [1962], yeah something like that. And because he first was--we were about to move to Dallas, Texas and President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed, was killed, and my parents were, I think they were in discussions about Dallas and this job offer my father had gotten there and decided not to go. And then he was getting others from other places and for some reason he--you know, my parents had made a trip to New England once. And my father went up to look at the place, got offered a job, and they flew him out to visit, and he liked it and thought it was a safe place. And I think that, I think also he saw things changing in the neighborhood. He saw things changing in the country, and my parents began to get a little nervous about their teenage kids that they were raising who were moving out into the world, you know--
Speaker 1: You said things changing?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the '60s [1960s] were about a Civil Rights Movement, but you also saw, you know, it was also a larger social movement going on in the country. Also Vietnam [Vietnam War] had already started. I remember in, a boy, you know, two guys in my neighborhood [Wilson Park, Baltimore, Maryland] who were older guys, you know, these older guys I really looked up to, were like big brothers to me. And one of them was one of my best friend's big brother. And they were quite a few years older, you know, but they finished high school and went off to join the [U.S. military] service and went to Vietnam early on. They didn't come back. So you started, you know, in the black community, a lot of these things that were, you know, becoming real to the rest of the country were very real in our neighborhood because we were already losing soldiers early on in the Vietnam. And we were, and we were seeing, with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, you saw the beginning of a pushback, you know, that was, that you felt in the neighborhood that had to do with changing businesses, things--just stuff happening that was a little bit different. And I think my parents were reading it very well, you know, that we were moving towards difficult times, you know, the '70s [1970s] were gonna come in, the '80s [1980s], you know, and things were gonna get rougher and rougher and here (unclear). And they were, they were looking at kids who were getting--and there was, there were, and also young, you know, for my generation, we're growing up and we're becoming much more assertive about what we wanna do. And we're becoming a part of this, and we're trying to--we haven't let's say intellectually understood it all. So it's not formed in any sort of kind of clear, kind of political or social kind of idea of who we are. We just want, we just like the idea of independence, freedom, you know, all these kind of things that have slogans, but we wanna act 'em out. And I think my parents were looking at all that and saying well, you know, how do we, you know, and we were all getting our little bits of trouble here and there, you know, having problems in the neighborhood and, you know, little things that become big things, and suddenly become more dangerous than they should be, you know. And I think my parents wanted to get us away from that, and they got us really far. They took us to New Hampshire, you know. I think that's part of the motivation, but it's also, you know, they're--my father's getting job offers. My mother is, you know, is getting offers too, and they can make a different life for us, but they're also looking for a place where they can make it. They can save their--they were thinking about their kids, you know. They see the idea of teenagers growing up and what that means. And they're trying to be able to continue living their life and move forward, but at the same time, not lose their kids, you know. And, you know, they chose New Hampshire.
Speaker 1: How was that different from Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: About as different as different can be (laughter). New Hampshire was about as different as different can be from Baltimore. Let me tell you, hey, you know, we, we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In every way.
Speaker 2: --we plotted our parents' demise many times up there in New Hampshire where we had plenty of time to sit and think and do nothing, you know, (laughter). It was, you know, we moved from an inner-city to, you know, a house that was sitting out by itself in the woods, you know, the beginnings of a new housing development, you know, that didn't develop very fast. And, you know, we, we got, you know, where (laughter), you know, it's--we're chopping wood in the summertime for the fireplace, when before, you know, we were, you know, going out to parties, you know. Our pastime becomes fishing and skating on a frozen pond rather than, you know, hanging out with our friends in the city, you know. It was dramatically different, you know--
Speaker 1: Were there any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and we're in an all-white town. And we're obviously highly visible, new people in town, you know, and in the high school [Nashua High School; Nashua High School South, Nashua, New Hampshire] and everything, you know. So, it's, you know, it's traum- traumatically different than what Baltimore was.
Story_ID: 485223
Speaker 1: What's the high school called?
Speaker 2: It's, we went to--my older brother [Donald Bagwell, Jr.] and sister [Janesta Bagwell] and I went to Nashua High School [Nashua High School South, Nashua, New Hampshire], and I think my parents [Barbara Jones Bagwell and Donald Bagwell, Sr.] believed that because we were moving north, we were moving to better schools, worse school I've ever gone to. Not that it was, a not kind of nice school, but it was academically, always not a strong school. And the school, I think I stopped learning a lot after I left ninth grade. I think I kind of cruised through sophomore, junior and kind of came back to it my senior year. But what I got out of New Hampshire more in school was I started going out--I went out for the track team and started running and running, and it stayed with me the rest of my life (laughter). And I made good friends there, and I learned a lot about myself, you know, and some of the things I did outside of school were very useful to me in terms of my own development. I had maybe one or two teachers that really kind of, you know, a history teacher my junior, a chemistry teacher my junior year, but I, you know, I just felt like academically, we were much better off in the Catholic high schools we were in and more challenged than what we got once we got to New Hampshire. It was an old mill town that was, in its own way, changing dramatically, you know, but hadn't really, but still was a population of those who used to work in the mill mainly, you know. And these new people were moving in as a part of the high tech, but my father is--the company my father joined was like one of the first ones there. And, you know, now it's a different place, but at that time, it was an old high school. And it kind of operated that way, and most of those kids didn't go off to college, you know. You had some, but most of 'em didn't go to college, you know. So it wasn't, it wasn't the same environment we were in in the high schools we were going to in Baltimore [Maryland].
Story_ID: 485224
Speaker 1: And when you were in high school [Nashua High School; Nashua High School South, Nashua, New Hampshire], had you, did you continue to have decided that you were going to college?
Speaker 2: I think there was a moment there where I decided that I wasn't gonna do anything because I think I was so disgusted with certain things. I began to develop a big chip on my shoulder. I resented the, the ways in which people perceived you, you know, in the sense of what they thought your, your potential was. I found it to be kind of a, academically, a waste of time, and I kind of acted that way. I remember my junior year, a teacher my junior year who was teaching a civics and history class. And the first semester, we had to do tax returns, you know, and corporate tax returns. And then he wanted us to understand the basic structure in which, you know, the government looked at the economics of a company and then taxed you, with the tax laws and stuff like that. So he would give us a complicated kind of company that you had to then do their taxes for them. And, you know, it's, taxes are not that hard. They, they're all instructions. If you read the manuals, you can do good--you can do accurate taxes. And if you have some level of math proficiency, you can do those things, you know. And I used to hand him mine, and they were always perfect. And he would say, who are you, (laughter), you know, 'cause I was this smart aleck little kid by then who had just kind of decided that this is all a big waste, and they don't really see me. And the way you can see me is I'll just, you know, talk trash all the time and had a chip. Really, I developed a real attitude in a sense. And I don't think I was really moving in a direction of college then, at that point. I had kind of, somewhat, you know, I might have been talking it, but I wasn't really acting it, you know. He kind of pulled me aside and said, look, you're wasting, you know, you got much more going on than you show, and you'd better--if you really wanna do anything with it, nobody here is gonna help you do it. You gotta do it yourself, and you better start doing it. And it got my attention. And I think, you know, I remember taking my PSATs [Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test]. I didn't even, you know, I wouldn't--where in Baltimore [Maryland], I was always preparing for tests and the standardized tests, didn't prepare at all. You know, it was like, I wasn't, I wasn't into it. I could have lost myself then. And he kind of got my attention, and I came back the next year, at the end of that year and in the senior year and decided I was gonna go to college. And I was gonna do it on my own. I wasn't gonna go through my guidance counselor who was giving me really bad advice on where to go and stuff. I was gonna do it on my own, and I started talking with my mom [Barbara Jones Bagwell] and trying to think through how to do this right, you know, and taking a different attitude in school too and my--and taking my SATs and stuff like that. So, that's how I got in BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 485225
Speaker 1: You said that a lot of the people at Nashua High School [Nashua High School South, Nashua, New Hampshire] didn't go to college, but then just now, you mentioned that there was college guidance. How did you get hooked up with the guidance counselor?
Speaker 2: I went to see him on my own. He didn't like come to see me. I went to see him on my own, and his recommendation was so absurd that I never went back to see him again. And I wasn't stupid, you know, but I wasn't necessarily paying, doing the things that were necessary to kind of--I should have been seeing him in my junior year. If I were at the high school I was at in Baltimore [Maryland], I would have been seeing him into my sophomore year. I would have been planning my junior year. But, you know, I kind of lost my way for a bit there. But, you know, and I can't blame it all on the school. I think, you know, when you make a major move like that, there's a whole lot of other trauma that goes along with it, you know. I think that in some sense we resented the fact that we were there. You know, so my sophomore year was really kind of a, get-adjusted to this place, you know, and find some friends and find some, some space that you exist--that you can participate in. And I think it took a while to get there. You know, so I don't blame it all on the school, but, you know, but, you know, you're so impressionable when you're teenagers, you know. And so you're reading certain things as, you know, lack of, of acknowledgement of who you are. And it could be somebody else is saying, I'm as confused as you are. Why are you here, you know? And what do you want? And you look, and in some way, you're a teenager, and you wanna feel like you're growing up, but at the same time, you're really still--you need guidance. And, and I think--so it took a while for us to kind of figure it out, you know. And I think it took me a while. I'm kind of lucky that it didn't take more time, you know.
Story_ID: 485226
Speaker 1: And did you, were you attending church when you moved to Nashua [New Hampshire]? Did you and your brothers and sisters go to church at all?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, church was really a part of the school environment. It wasn't, church wasn't something that we necessarily saw as our community because it wasn't, you know. I mean my father [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] was from a Baptist church, and that's a different kind of world because if you're in a black church, it kind of nurtures you. We were at a Catholic church [Blessed Sacrament, Baltimore, Maryland]. It was mainly an Irish Catholic church, you know, and, you know, we were there because we were in the school [Blessed Sacrament School, Baltimore, Maryland], and we were altar boys, and we were into it 'cause we wanted to be there. But (unclear), you don't feel like you really belong there, you know. And it wasn't like it, you know, it was like a ying-yang, you know. It was like, some things you're in, but then you're there, then they don't really want you in, you know. You're in, so you're not really in. It's not like a community. It's not a nurturing community. So church was something that, while I was studying religion and into school, it was, I felt obligated to do because I felt that I would go to hell if I didn't, you know. When I got big enough to start thinking about that on my own and what heaven and hell was, and what was my own thoughts about right and wrong and good and bad, and all that kind of stuff, it didn't really serve that purpose. It wasn't like, it was knee-jerk thing. So it was a much more complicated thing, and I didn't have a conversation to make the complicated part make sense to me. So went to New Hampshire, I--it's interesting, where I didn't, where I did get into was the Catholic Youth Organization [CYO] and started to work there and become actively involved in that because that became community. But I didn't go to church. I don't think I went to church on Sunday at all. I went to Chris- you know Catholic Youth Organization and became a, like a regional president of that and men basketball leagues and did all kinds of things through them, speaking, you know, that was part of finding community with other kids that were into something, and, you know, it gave me something, I got something back from. That was, that was how I got, you know, I was into that for that reason, but I didn't, you never saw me Sunday at church.
Story_ID: 485227
Speaker 1: So you get focused your senior year [at Nashua High School; Nashua High School South, Nashua, New Hampshire], you decide you're going to college. You said, things worked out on the SAT, and so you were accepted to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: I got accepted to all the schools I applied to.
Speaker 1: Where else did you apply?
Speaker 2: I applied to the University of New Hampshire [Durham, New Hampshire], I applied to Tufts [Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts], and I applied to Boston University, and thought, I applied to those schools because some way my mother [Barbara Jones Bagwell] had helped me decide that I wanted to study, like a biology kind of pre-med kind of thi- kind of thing. I went to the health school, and there was a--she was, my mother was trying to say well, you could become, you know, you're into track and field, so you could become a physical therapist or something like that or you could even decide you want to become a doctor. But you should get into the sciences and start getting on a track and so I went to their health school and got accepted into the health school. And, yeah.
Speaker 1: And once you actually got to Boston University, how was that health curriculum for you?
Speaker 2: Well, there were two things that happened when I got to Boston University. I mean, number one, I was on my own which was really kind of dangerous (laughter). And my first semester of school, I did very bad. The second semester, I did very well. I kind of caught on finally, not very well, but I did well enough to get back to a third and by my third, I was--I understood, I kind of got it then. But one of the good things about the third year, or third semester is that you had to work in a hospital, that you had an obligation to work--I was working part time at a job to get my, help me get through school. But they had a requirement where you had to spend one or two days, evenings in hospitals as a part of school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, you said, now you said you were working a job. Was that a hospital?
Speaker 2: No, I was working a job actually in an engineering firm. My father [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] really wanted me to become an engineer (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he got me a job, connected me to some people that I could get a job with (unclear). I would work there part time. My parents were always about, you had to pay for some of your education. And when I worked in the hospital, the, the requirement of spending one semester, I had to spend evenings like two nights a week in the hospital working different parts of the hospital. And I realized I didn't--and the hospital didn't work with me. I didn't come home from the hospital feeling good. I came home from the hospital feeling--it didn't work with my, my temperament. It wasn't that I didn't like the work, but there were certain places I couldn't, I couldn't--I wasn't able to kind of, to work through the sickness and people not getting better, you know. Those things were very hard for me. And I realized I wouldn't be able to work in this environment the rest of my life. And at least, the good thing about it was I came to that realization. And I decided at that point that I was on the wrong track and that this was not the work that--and I was enjoying my classes at that point, but I realized I was on the wrong track. And I decided I was gonna take a leave of absence from school, take a semester to kind of think about what I want to do.
Story_ID: 485228
Speaker 1: I took my second semester, sophomore year, and I took off. And I think it was also that I was feeling that school wasn't--I couldn't make it connect with what I, I couldn't make it make sense or have a relevancy to me. And that was a tough year because I was, you know, kind of floating. I had an idea I was gonna work, you know, travel, and my sister and I were living together, and I was working and I lost my job. And, you know, it's just wasn't--trying to live in an apartment too and living in Boston [Massachusetts]. And my parents [Barbara Jones Bagwell and Donald Bagwell, Sr.], when I left school, they decided they weren't gonna pay anymore for me. So if I wanted to get back to school, I had to do it on my own. And, and it was the summer of the semester, and then the summer. And that summer, I had hooked up with this place [United South End Settlements, Boston, Massachusetts] and had, through a girlfriend, and said that I was gonna work at this camp for the summer. And it was with this Harriet Tubman House [Boston, Massachusetts] that was a community center in the South End of Boston. And that was a breakthrough for me because suddenly I was, I was with young people and what I believed in and everything. So I could make work and make sense, you know, on a work level. And so I started working there, and I decided I was gonna get myself back in school, and I had been--I had bought a still camera and had been taking pictures and doing some slide shows and things like that. And one of my, and my roommate in freshman year was in the school of communications [Boston University College of Communication, Boston, Massachusetts] and was in film school. And, not in the film school, the school of communications, and he said to me--and I had always worked with films in high school, teaching, using them for teaching things, for teaching with my CYO work, Catholic Youth Organization work, and had brought, done a presentation in my sociology class with films about conditions in schools in urban areas. And my friend said, you really under--you really seem to know something about movies, and when you talk about them, and I really didn't know that and feel that way because I didn't really go to movies and stuff, you know. But he got my attention, and I decided I'd try and get back in school in the film school, which was a very small program in the communications school. I think they had like ten students, and I got in.

Speaker 1: --Leadership position. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] reluctantly becomes a leader and understands the role of leadership. But Ella Baker understood it too, but Ella Baker understood it that leadership was about empowering people to then lead themselves, and she encouraged the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] students and those who were--to do that, and recognized all along that, you know, certain people would emerge as a person people would follow. But you never allow for people to follow you to the point where they can't lead themselves, and that's what she taught Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] so well, you know, and that Bob then took with him out into the fields of Mississippi, you know. But, well, you know, but you can't fault people for fol- wanting to follow somebody, you know. It's something that we, we find inspiration in places and in some ways, they then help us become better ourselves. And sometimes those people that they follow, it's really society that places them on a pedestal and puts them up there as something bigger than life, just like they made King into something bigger than life, but King never wanted to be bigger than life. He enjoyed, he's a preacher and he enjoys talking to the people and being--but he realizes he's the messenger. There are other people who are really leading them into the, into the battle, you know. Malcolm [Malcolm X] would say the same thing, you know. But I think, that's a--Ella Baker is really about empowering people to lead themselves. That was, and, you know, but at the same time she was head of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], the first president of SCLC [sic.]. She was, the most interesting thing about her is she was a fierce woman in the midst of all these men at a time when no, women couldn't be there, you know, very few women could be in, occupy those spaces. And she had to deal with all that kind of resentment, you know, and that kind of sexism that was, that was part of--that is present today, but even more accepted then, you know, especially among ministers in a world where ministers really were the, called the shots. But it's good, she's a good person to do. You could write fifteen pages on her; you gotta keep it to forty-five.
Story_ID: 485230
Speaker 1: You're returning to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] to work on film now, and you've gotten yourself into this small program because it's been pointed out to you that--
Speaker 2: I believe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) it's something you may an affinity with. And you've got some familiarity with using it in the teaching model. What happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, my parents [Barbara Jones Bagwell and Donald Bagwell, Sr.] (laughter), my parents tell me that, number one, they're not supporting me to go to school anymore. They never bought into me--they don't see film as a major for school, number one. So I had to start working full-time and going to school, which was fine because it helped me find ways that I made school make sense for my--as a total part of my life, you know, which was really good. And I started making movies, like I--in the first year, I got into a filmmaking class. I mean I was, I had no film language. I had no experience doing it. I barely watched films. What I found early on, is that I was a storyteller, though. I did understand telling stories and although I might have kind of simple film vocabulary in that first year, you couldn't deny my storytelling. And, and I enjoyed it. I found that I liked--that something about the combination of the storytelling and the creative work, as well as the, the technology and the science of all--all appealed to my many different parts. And I enjoyed it tremendously. And, you know, I started to feel good about school too, about myself in school. And it made, it made my--and I think at that time is when I announced my other major which was my minor, or my, you know, which was history 'cause I also found--it's interesting to say this. My first black teacher, African American teacher was in college, and he taught a class on Richard Wright. And then after that I took another class on Baldwin [James Baldwin], and that was like, I was home then, you know.
Speaker 1: What was that professor's name?
Speaker 2: Sam [ph.], he's a poet, Sam. What is Sam's last name? It's not there anymore. I could find that out.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I forget. I don't have it in mind right now.
Speaker 1: You don't have to--
Speaker 2: It'll come back to me--
Story_ID: 485231
Speaker 1: How soon do you start working with children after school in film?
Speaker 2: Well, that happened immediately actually 'cause it was a funny thing. I came out of that summer as a counselor, and the center asked me to come back and work with their after-school program. And I started working there, and no sooner had I gotten there, that the woman who was running it quit. And they offered me a full-time job running the program, which meant that I would work most of my hours in the evening. But I would, the days when I didn't have classes at school [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], I would spend my after- my days there, you know, working through the planning and the preparation and the, you know, just all the things to kind of set up the program. And it was really working in a center that really didn't have a lot of programs coming out of it. But what had happened is, once they gave me the job to run the after-school program, it didn't have a lot of kids coming to it either. But when they asked me to do it, I noticed that there is a lot of new housing projects that were built by the church in the neighborhood--there was a church on the corner, and they built a lot of low-income housing on Columbus Avenue. And I started recruiting from those homes. And then I, I petitioned for a little bit of money from the settlement house organization [United South End Settlements, Boston, Massachusetts] that ran this particular house [Harriet Tubman House, Boston, Massachusetts], and we renovated the house. And, you know, sanded and cleaned all the floors repainted the whole place and fixed it up so that somebody would want to come and be there and upgraded our offices and we started recruiting kids in and started bringing in a whole group of new kids. And suddenly the place was full of kids and teenagers. And we started a teen program too, and we then built a stage down on the corner and, you know, and started working and built, transformed a lot of the lots that were empty there into playgrounds and stuff like that, and started turning it into a new place. And then I started, I worked through the schools to get, to work with all the different schools in the area to kind of work with them to get our statuses up as an employer of work-study students, so I could recruit students in work-study programs. And I started building a cadre of teachers who were doing after school classrooms, teaching in math and reading and then other kinds of arts and other kinds of things. And then I taught a, I built a dark room on the top floor and taught photography and started doing a video class there.
Story_ID: 485232
Speaker 1: And did you have a, did you integrate history with your video classes [at Harriet Tubman House, Boston, Massachusetts] at that early stage?
Speaker 2: Not really. My video classes, I worked with--I found that when you're working with neighborhood kids, it's really you're helping them--you want them to kind of come up with stories, number one. It's like the early days of youth video in a sense. But you also want them to--and oftentimes, they want stories about themselves and about their neighborhoods. So you're helping them then look at their neighborhoods and see stories within their neighborhoods that they want to tell, that they can tell and to explore beyond the kind of superficial story into, okay, what's this really about? What's the drama in this story? What's this really about, you know, and challenging them to do that. And, and then helping them make stories that way. And then I'd bring some of my students who were in my classes in to work with me and to be a part of, you know, working with the students. And we kind of grew from that, and started developing these incredible relationships with parents and students there that now I see, they grow up and they stop me on the street when I go to Boston [Massachusetts] or if I'm in a city, and say, "Aren't you?" And then I realize it's one of the little kids that used to be a part of the program and they now have grown up and become something else. And we started a scholarship program out of there, and we got--we would, eventually had two scholarships that we were making available for Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] students from that area. But, yeah, and, but it made sense for me. It made my school make sense and it made my filmmaking make sense. And--
Speaker 1: And it paid for you to--
Speaker 2: And it paid for me because it was a full-time job, and I could, I could pay for my--I paid for my living and my, I took care of my housing and my living and everything. And I'd gotten, by that time I'd also gotten scholar- I was on scholarship at school [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts]. So I was on pretty much a full scholarship coming back in school.
Story_ID: 485233
Speaker 1: I've got two questions competing. So how early in your, or perhaps you'll need to tell me a little bit more about your progression through Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]. But it sounded like, from our talk, that you started doing some freelance work at WBGH [sic. WGBH-TV, Boston, Massachusetts] while you were at Boston University (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, what happened is that at Boston University, I took that first year film class and got hooked, and wanted to take more classes in the film unit. But they didn't think I was promising enough (laughter). And matter of fact, they rejected me in all the film, the additional, the advanced film classes. So I started--and it's like going to Nashua High School [Nashua High School South, Nashua, New Hampshire] and then that counselor, and I disagree with my counselor in terms of what they, he wanted. But he could not, he was the one who really had to sign for me to get into the advanced film class. So I never took them at Boston University. What I then did is decide I was gonna start planning my own class schedule, looking at what I needed to get, in order to graduate and what I had. And I started taking classes in the fine arts department so I could then begin to start developing an eye, you know, number one, but also beginning to more critically talk and think about, you know, art and art history in a sense.
Speaker 1: What did they find lacking in terms of your potential?
Speaker 2: They felt I was a good, as they said, as I went back and looked through my record, I was a good affirmative action case, but I wasn't a promising future filmmaker. Well, I mean I didn't come with--and I can understand that because I didn't come with any, I had very limited vocab- you know, whereas some students were making these very elaborate, you know, dramatic pieces, you know, in class with lots of edits and lots, you know, of props and lots of, you know, things. I was making very simple films. One thing I can say is that the films that I made and when I showed them in class, they always had real impact on the students there. Now, I don't know if it's because they saw things they had never seen before or they heard a discussion they'd never seen before. But I know that even my teacher responded to what I was showing. So I felt very strongly that I was at least in something that was doing what I wanted to do, was making a statement that I thought was important to make.
Story_ID: 485234
Speaker 1: But I was not, I was not a sophisticated filmmaker by no means. And I was getting more sophisticated because I was working not only in the classroom, but I was also working in this community center and making stuff, you know, and still working as a, as a photographer and my photography was making money for me as well, you know, doing projects and graphic artwork. So all that was, you know, and he wasn't, you know, he just saw me, you know. I mean he had his own--and I, you know, I lived with a lot of that so it didn't deter me. But I started making friends with, there was a guy, Dassel Banks [ph.] who was, used to hang out on the steps next to the Tubman House [Harriet Tubman House, Boston, Massachusetts] with this--he had a friend there, this guy named George [ph.]. And Dassel was a cameraman who worked at one of the local TV stations. And Dassel used to give me a lot of advice on what to do to kind of prepare myself to kind of work in the business. And then I met some young men who worked for one of the local TV stations. And back then, TV stations were doing a lot of film work 'cause that's what they were shooting in the field, was film, reversal film. And they would process it there. And there was a guy who was doing a program that was on every--weekly, a weekly program. But he was shooting music at a jazz club there, and so I started with them and working there with them, I started learning how to light or at least set up lights and out of that, getting a sense of lighting. I started working with cameras so I was working as an assistant. I was loading and setting up cameras and those kind of things. And that began to turn into jobs, you know. At first I was doing it was free just to kind of learn and I'd do any one--any job I could get in filmmaking, working on a film, I would do. And then, you know, that gave me some experience. And then I started getting paid jobs, you know, purely by accident. You know, I would hang out with a film--with a cameraman I knew and go with them. And then, you know, fill in for an AC [assistant cameraman] here and there and I started getting paid for it and started--so I started getting a few paid jobs. And my first jobs with Public Broadcasting [Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)] were actually with WNET [WNET-TV, New York, New York] here working for a program that this guy, Tony Batten, did that I was working with, this cameraman. And I would just, I happened to hang out with him one day, and they picked me up to fill in for an AC, you know. And that's where I met Bobby Sheppard [Robert Shepard] for the first time and (unclear) brother and this guy, Philippe Barretto [ph.], who was a sound man, and this guy Rick Butler who was a cameraman. And they were the first guys that kind of showed me how to be a professional in that space. And so I started working as an assistant cameraman. And that's how I got into the WGBH [WGBH-TV, Boston, Massachusetts]. They, [HistoryMaker] Marita Rivero, was a producer and Henry Johnson was a cameraman, came to a presentation I made, a slide show I'd done on Harriet Tubman in the Harriet Tubman House. And we were having dinner afterwards, and they were talking about this project they were trying to staff up for that Marita was gonna do on the Nation of Islam, a film, a documentary. And Henry was saying he was looking for an AC. And I said, I raised my, "I AC," and then he said, "Yeah?" And I'd worked on the camera he was working with, but I said, I can, I think I can do it. And he hired me as an AC. I went to Chicago [Illinois] with them, and we--the first one I worked for, for WGBH was a film for a show called 'Say Brother.' And it was an hour-long piece on the Nation of Islam, and we were there the year that Elijah Muhammad died. We were at Saviours' Day. And it was an amazing experience, you know. I mean you're in the middle of a major historical moment and the story of the Nation of Islam in this country, and we're making a movie. And I'm working with, I'm in a professional job, and I'm traveling to another city, and I'm making a movie. And then I got hired to be an AC, a freelance, as a freelance assistant cameraman on other shows through 'Say Brother.' And then with this producer, Topper Carew, who was doing a show called 'Rebop' for kids. And--
Speaker 2: Can you talk a little bit about those shows? You know, 'Say Brother,' what is that show?
Speaker 1: 'Say Brother' is a news and public affairs program for, on the black community on issues of--
Speaker 2: And is it based in Chicago?
Speaker 1: It's based in Boston [Massachusetts]. We traveled to Chicago to make this film, and at that time, it was, it had gotten funds to be a national program, and so we were doing national stories. So I would go around as an AC working with them. But the good thing about WGBH, once you come in as an assistant, you're not only an assistant camera, but you become assistant editor as well. So you work in the camera, you know, out in the field, work, show--you know, when the films are being shot, but then you work in the edit room as an editor as they're putting it together. So you learn filmmaking, where I wasn't really able to have that kind of experience in, at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]. I also started making my own films then. I made my first independent film, and I used that to, to then apply for an AFI [American Film Institute] independent filmmaker grant and got it.
Story_ID: 485235
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your first independent film?
Speaker 2: It was a film called, what was the title of the film?
Speaker 1: Or what was it about?
Speaker 2: It was about a young man that I had met as a counselor [at Harriet Tubman House, Boston, Massachusetts] in that, in the summer, and then--and he was a tough, everybody thought he was a problem. But I got along with him really well, and I liked him. He was really smart and really inventive. But he just needed somebody to notice him, and so I saw some of me in him, you know, and befriended him. And he became like my little, a little brother to me, and then one day he announced he's gonna be a, become a, you know, he's, you know, he's searching, constantly searching. One he decided he was gonna become a boxer, and he's into it. He's gonna box, box. He's gonna be the next Muhammad Ali, and so I make a film about him, and it's really about, you know, when you don't know what your strengths really are, you try lots of things. And here he's trying to be a boxer, and it was really, it's as much--he was, he was a big personality. He had a lot of bravado but such a--but behind it was this really smart, interesting guy who really didn't, you know, didn't get, go to the right school, didn't have the right opportunities, stuff like that, but had so much potential. And he, and he had all this bravado about being a boxer and then, you know, but he'd never stepped in a ring (laughter). You know, it's not--it's a different thing when you step in the ring for the first time (laughter), you know. So I made a film about all that, and it was a really, funny, nice film about him, and it got their attention and they gave me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is the American Film Institute [AFI]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, they gave me an independent filmmakers grant which I didn't even know what it was when I applied for it. I just saw it and decided I'd apply. I'd send my film, and then I get the award and suddenly senators are writing me, congressmen are writing me. People in the industry are writing me, actors are writing me, directors are writing saying how prestigious this award is. And I just applied as a, you know--because someone had mentioned the fund, and I wanted to make another movie. And this was the way to do it. And I was making a, then I made a--I was making a movie, and then my next movie, my independent film was about a young--it was not a young, but a street storyteller, this guy, Brother Blue. He was from Boston [Massachusetts]. He was a doctor of divinity, but he spends his life telling stories on the street, and I traveled with him making that. But all the time, I'm also working at WGBH [WGBH-TV, Boston, Massachusetts] and 'Rebop' was a national program that traveled all over the country, making short films about kids and young children, teenagers. And, but it was a great learning experience for me because I would be on the road shooting with these films and then go back in the edit room with the editor, editing them. And ultimately, I got a chance to start shooting. They would hire, they would let me, they would have me doing second cameraman and camera work, and after they noticed that and saw that, an eye, and some skill, they started hiring me to shoot films for it too. And that was the beginning of my work, my career as a way to make a living, while I was trying to make movies at the same time, which is always such a difficult thing to do. So I could always, I, and out of that I then went from WGBH, and I went down to WETA [WETA-TV, Washington, D.C.] and worked as an editor for a while, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. And then I came back and worked at WGBH some more. And then I worked, started working at Blackside [Blackside, Inc.] and it just started, and then you start developing a reputation. People know you was a cameraman and as an editor. And when I got to Blackside, and it was like the end of the, you know, end of '70s [1970s]--my son was born in '77 [1977], '77 [1977] I started working there. And they hired me as a filmmaker, and Blackside was great then because it was mainly doing--Henry [Henry Hampton] was there and this guy Romus [ph.] and Jackie Sheer [ph.] was there, but it was a place where they did mainly government films. But you did dramas and documentaries and things like that, but you worked as a producer-director. You could be the cameraman, you could be editor too. That's how I worked as an editor, cameraman on other people's films, my own cameraman in my films, as a director, as a writer and producer. And you would negotiate the deals and you had to figure out from your budget how you make a living doing it too. And I made everything from little dramas to long dramas to full-length documentaries and short documentaries to movie trailers to commercials. And you were doing it all the same time. And that's the beginning, when 'Eyes on the Prize' started back then in the company. It was called 'America, We Love You Madly' [sic. 'America, They Loved You Madly: The Civil Rights Years']. It was a project with Cap Cities [Capital Cities Communications] that never really--Cap Cities bailed out, but we made the first cuts and the first interviews and the first efforts at constructing stories of the Civil Rights Movement and an idea of what the series could be during that time, with Henry Johnson, me and [HistoryMaker] Judy Richardson.
Story_ID: 485236
Speaker 1: I've gotta ask this about your college days--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --which is a little off topic. Is your father [Donald Bagwell, Sr.] a Que? Is he an Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].
Speaker 1: He's an Alpha.
Speaker 2: I pledged Que.
Speaker 1: And how did that go? Why did you--
Speaker 2: My father didn't care--
Speaker 1: --choose to--
Speaker 2: Why did I choose (unclear)--
Speaker 1: No, why did you choose to pledge and--
Speaker 2: And why didn't I go over?
Speaker 1: And why did you choose not to complete that process?
Speaker 2: I choose to pledge Que because I had friends who were in the fraternity, and I thought fraternities were a good thing in the black community. I thought that the sense of camaraderie, I remember my father pledging and how much I liked the, the company of men that they represented, and I had good friends who were Ques that I respected. I didn't go over because I went all the way up to the very end and dropped just before we went over because I felt that there were some things that were going on with members of, on my line, young men, young black men who I felt that the big brothers never really wanted to go over, and rather than just let them go and send them off, they were gonna force them off, and it was not brotherly. It was not how we would, at that time, my idea of how you treated each other as brothers, that was not what I felt brotherhood was about. And I was very disenchanted by the process at that point. I loved a lot of the big brothers, and at the time, they really wanted me to go over. But, you know, at certain points certain things go against your principles, and something happened that I felt was just not right. And I couldn't accept the concept of brotherhood with something like that happening.
Speaker 1: Where were you in your years at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] when you--
Speaker 2: That was the year that I'd taken off from school and had--and, yeah, I was a sophomore. I didn't try it in my freshman year. I was a sophomore.
Story_ID: 485237
Speaker 1: And how did you find your junior and senior year at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts]? Clearly, you're working (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, I'd moved off campus by then. Junior, senior year I didn't live on campus. And I was, I found school was a part of a larger concept of living a life, you know, and I took it very serious. I had a great roommate who was a jazz deejay. And so we had plenty of people at our house all the time. My house was like a active place where people would just crash and the jazz club, anybody playing there would be staying at our house probably--most likely, you know. And it was a great place, but I was very clear about my work and school and I wouldn't come home until I'd done that all. You know, I'd spend my evenings in the library knowing I wasn't gonna study at home. And I seemed to have a, to develop a real order about my life, you know. And I'm very, had a very clear sense of what I wanted it to be. And at that point, I'd become very clear that I was gonna become a filmmaker too and that film was something I was in love with. And I was gonna keeping pursuing it. I'd kind of--I was lucky, you know, that I found something that, at that stage of my life.
Story_ID: 485238
Speaker 1: In retrospect, are you pleased that the Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] powers that be did not allow you to progress through the program at school? Do you think that you perhaps got a better education between Harriet Tubman [Harriet Tubman House, Boston, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, hindsight is, you know, and you say well, okay, I did okay, and so, but no, I think there's something about, and, you know, I learned a lesson from that, that when I look at and I judge people, you know, when you work in the business too, you have lots of filmmakers who come to you and want to work with you. And you realize it's not necessarily always about these structures or, or competencies that other people decide are gonna tell you that a person has the potential to be with what they're gonna be, you know. It really has more to do with a passion. I mean filmmaking is not easy work at all. I mean you have to really love to do it in order to do it. I mean it's, it's agony most of the time, you know. You totally feel, you feel totally--what's the right word? You have, you have, you lack confidence for most of the time you're doing it, you know, because you feel like you're gonna fail. You can't figure it out. You can't make it work. You're working endless hours, trying to make it happen, and you're not making any money, you know. You, you're--it's isolating. I mean you're working by yourself most of the time or with a few people. If you're working history, you're working in a timeframe that nobody else is in. So you really have nothing to talk about. Even when you start talking to people, you're talking about your movie, and they don't wanna hear it anymore. So all your friends kind of desert you because you're only one track. You know, it's, it gets very, so focused and myopic that it can be very isolating and lonely. And at the same time, you, each film, no matter how many you make, you feel that, you have such a long time of feeling like you're just gonna fail, you know, because it's so hard to get to that point where you've figured it out, you know, and you've gotta--so, it's not a, it's not a--unless you love it, you shouldn't be doing it. And plus, you gotta raise money for it too, and you don't, you know, and it's all those things. So I figured, I realized I loved it, you know, and that I--and that it wasn't about Boston University telling me I couldn't make movies at that time. I mean I went back to pro- to graduate school, and I was much more--I got much more affirmation than that time I'd, you know, I'd gotten the AFI [American Film Institute] grant. And I was, I'd become something, you know, but obviously this guy didn't see it early on. But I noticed that I learned that you have to kind of, you have to listen for other things. And I found that that's really helped me a lot, working with filmmakers, especially new filmmakers, emerging filmmakers and seeing what it is that you're looking for really. And, of course, you're looking for skills and you're looking for certain kinds of competencies, but you also realize that some of that can be taught and some of that can be learned, but there's certain things you can't teach, you can't learn. You have to have, you have to really, you have to really--it has to be there. And part of it is as a storyteller. You know, you meet people who are storytellers, but also as a certain kind of something you notice in someone that says, this is what they really wanna do. This is their language 'cause really you're talking about speaking another language and willing to kind of invest in learning it and being proficient in that and wanting, seeing through that language, you can express yourself like you could in any other play.
Story_ID: 485239
Speaker 1: I think for my instructor in school [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] at that time, I think that I had that, and I think you could have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The passion.
Speaker 1: The passion, and I think you--and the storytelling, but I think you could see it in the movies that I made. But he never really believed that they were mine, number one, which was one bad thing. He kept questioning whether I had really written this or whether this was really mine. But I think he never really was--and I think he was reluctant, he wouldn't allow himself to read the class either and to see how they were responding to what I did, even though, if it was somewhat simple, you know, in language, it was powerful in its, in how it connected with people.
Speaker 2: But you said even he was moved.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, so sometimes people are not gonna look beyond. They're not gonna believe, you know, this is when race, I think, comes back to it. I think that sometimes they don't believe that, even what they see or what moves them is going to make them believe that you are gonna be someone that the university should preserve that special spot for, you know. It's like, oftentimes, you're talking about, okay, there are only five that are gonna get into this. There're ten of you trying to get there. Are we gonna give it to you or we gonna give it to this other one over here? And you can't be, you gotta be color blind to do that, and I mean it's a hard thing. I mean even for me, I've gotta kind of put a lot of my stuff on the side sometimes when I'm looking proposals, even here at Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] or even when I was--and I'm working as a filmmaker, working in film and I'm collecting a group of, a team of filmmakers to work with me on a series. I've gotta see something that's gonna say, this one's the right one.
Speaker 2: But don't you automatically look to audience response when you are evaluating a filmmaker's work? Let's say you're in there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, sometimes they haven't made anything. Supposed they'd never produced a film. But I look at something, I gotta see something in them, and I've gotta see something in the work that they show me. You're right.
Speaker 2: And, but I'm saying when you're looking at the work that they're showing you, don't you automatically look to see the response of the others?
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes, there's no audience there. And sometimes you're only looking at it with them. What you are looking at is the work and their intention in the work and sometimes some of the things that they want, but they might not have achieved in the work. But you're also, you're in the conversation with them as well as what you're seeing. But you're also getting a sense of what they bring to it, and what they're gonna bring to what they are gonna do with you.
