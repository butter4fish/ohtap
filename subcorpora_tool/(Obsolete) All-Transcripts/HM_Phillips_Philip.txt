Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Philip Wirth Phillips, P-H-I-L-I-P, W-I-R-T-H, P-H-I-L-L-I-P-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure about the Wirth part, but definitely, there's a story behind the fact that I am named Philip, one of which has just, just became clear to me two years ago.  My mother's--that's, and it's a little more complicated than that.  My mother's half brother's father was named Philip.  Now, the story that was passed to me is that my parents met for lunch one day when I was, when I was--she was carrying me.  And they decided that it would be interesting to name a kid Philip.  But since I've now become aware of the fact that the father of my mother's brother was named Philip, I think that's an easier explanation.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So it's an economical use of names.
Speaker 2: Economical use of names.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It was there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Philip W--Wirth Phillips.  And--
Speaker 2: And "Wirth", I don't know the origin of that at all.  That was just sort of, that was never explained to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 28, 1958 in Scarborough, Tobago.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Tobago is a companion island to Trinidad, right?
Speaker 2: Companion island to Trinidad.
Speaker 1: And Scarborough, is that a--
Speaker 2: That's the capital.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we lived in the capital, which sounds more official than it actually is.  It's really just one of the towns (laughter) in Tobago, nothing--some office buildings, but nothing that would really mark it distinctly as separate from the other cities on the, or towns on the island is probably better to say.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: So I'm a professor of physics at the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois].  And, so I'm a full professor of physics, and I teach and do research in physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you are the--now, you have an endowed position, right, from what I understand?
Speaker 2: Not, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.  I just, I've had some sort of special money from various sorts of--
Speaker 1: Grants--
Speaker 2: --quote, "endowed" things.  For example, this, what is it called?  I forgot (laughter).  That's really bad.  There's something that I have that is, that might have, I think it ran out.  But it's something where the engineering college, you know, it's given to people who they think are doing something interesting, I guess, and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so I have here that you were the Bliss faculty--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Bliss, Bliss, there we go.  Yeah, the Bliss faculty scholars (laughter).  Right, I forgot about that.
Speaker 1: And you're also the--I don't know if this is the same thing, but University scholar.
Speaker 2: Right, okay, so that is a sort of endowed position.  It's given for research accomplishments and it helps fund your research for, there's a special pot of money set aside for you.  So, yes, those can be viewed as endowed.  They endow your research, but it's not as if it's a, it's a permanent endowed chair which pays your salary, and, you know, gives you research money.  So I do not have anything like that.
Speaker 1: All right.  But you're no ordinary faculty member here in that regard, so I just wanna--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --make sure that we pointed that out.  So, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the 7th of June, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in the Room 217 of the Swanland Hall at the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign].
Story_ID: 27614
Speaker 1: Okay, now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask as a warm up--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is it?
Speaker 2: Curry.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, that's a spice more than a--(laughter)--
Speaker 2: I mean curried anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Curried goat, curried chicken, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's entirely because of how I grew up in Trinidad and Tobago.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I, I'm sort of color blind and so I, it's--they're all pretty much equivalent to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Definitely the summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do not like the winter, I mean because of where I was born (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Tobago.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I--it changes.  I mean sayings I've been known to repeat are typically more absurd like "Anything worth doing is worth overdoing".  But I would say those who know me would say I am known for various phrases that I keep saying, but I--aside from that one, I can't really remember any.  But, yeah.
Story_ID: 27615
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family separately from your father's side, and then we'll ask about his side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then we'll put 'em together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Okay, Carmella Daniel is her maiden name, C-A-R-M-E-L-L-A, D-A-N-I-E-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I hate to say this.  I can only answer the latter of those.  She was born in Parlatuvier--
Speaker 1: Oh, we have to spell that.  That's--
Speaker 2: Tobago.  P-A-R-L-A-T-U-V-I-E-R, Tobago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you suppose your mother was born in the 1930s or--I mean, just to put it into--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She is 70-something, so '40s [1940s] would be when she was born?
Speaker 1: Forties [1940s], okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, 1940s.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side, and do you know any stories about what they were doing in history?
Speaker 1: Past, the, her immediate family at the time, I do not know anything.  I, she had a half brother who is, who was roughly 10 years older than she is.  And that side of the family was quite--right, so my mother's mother who is my grandmother, who was my--well, she, she died roughly 16 years ago.  Her name was Ellen.  She's known as, she was known as Vio, so V-I-O.  So she fathered my mother's brother to a man named Philip Francois and my mother's brother was named Bertyl, B-E-R-T-Y-L.  And that was a very dysfunctional family (laughter).  And it certainly played out quite extensively.  Beyond that I don't know anything about what they were doing.  I mean if you go back far enough, I mean they were brought, they were slaves from some place in--I don't, I don't know what the country exactly in Africa.  But that history, I think, has had a, quite negative effect.
Story_ID: 27616
Speaker 1: Are there any stories passed down through the family or the community about what slavery was like on Tobago?
Speaker 2: So, I mean I know some general history that I've become aware of.  Slavery played out in the sense that families were separated.  So relatives were not, were forbidden from living in close quarters, and as a result, this led to ill feelings towards your neighbors and ridicule of one's neighbors.  And it wasn't--and this is sort of something that plays out widely in the island in the sense that West Indians generally today, even point out faults of everyone and make fun of them.  And I think this is something that definitely dates back to the community, how it was set up in the early days.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're saying it's part of a slave mentality--
Speaker 2: It's part of a slave mentality.  It's unreconstructed, post-colonial and I think it has not been dealt with.  It's now become part of the way people interact with one another.  It's part of the family dynamic and that was--and it's harsh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know many African Americans point to the same kind of a syndrome, you know, in this country.
Speaker 2: I don't think it's, I think it's very, I don't think all--I don't think slave cultures have, are very different in that regard.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  People have devoted their lives trying to reverse the process.
Speaker 2: Trying to reverse that process, and I think it is, right.  The objectification of people is something that has had incredibly negative consequences for people who live in an extremely isolated environment, especially--and hence, islands.  It's very hard to reverse any of that in an isolated community, isolated, I mean geographically and also socially.  So it accents the dysfunction which was there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this, this discussion indicates to me that you've thought about these issues, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, I've thought deeply about this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And I'm just surprised how these people really don't discuss this, you know, at all.
Speaker 2: I've written a story about this (laughter).  You know, I mean I--aside from physics, this is probably the thing I think about the most which is odd, right?
Speaker 1: No, it makes sense.  I mean, I, I know I'm astounded that people don't even want to think about that period of time and its cons--its repercussions today.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They don't make the link.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they don't make the link.
Speaker 1: And they still blame each other for, I mean, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the negative ways.
Speaker 2: They can't see beyond the immediate dysfunction to the actual cause of it.  And I've been very much focused on the cause of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And that's probably because I am a scientist.  I want to get to the bottom of it.  I don't wanna just settle on some superficial sort of secondary effect.
Story_ID: 27617
Speaker 1: Okay, so they were not allowed to marry, my grandmother, Vio, and her lover whose name is Philip or was Philip, Philip Francois.  And she did marry, and she married someone whose name I don't really know, but it's because we left when I was 10, and I only knew him as Daddy Mack.  So that is my father--that is my mother's [Carmella Daniel] father.  So for lack of a better name, we'll just call him Daddy Mack.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, you say that your grandmother was, and her lover, Philip Francois, were not allowed to marry.  Who, you know, stopped them from getting married, or what stopped them?
Speaker 1: Well, it's the standard story.  Parents--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in authoritarian societies, parents determine what their objects of control will do.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay, that makes sense.  I thought I'd ask though, just to make sure.  Okay, so, okay, so Daddy Mack, who you don't remember his name--was his name Mack at all?
Speaker 1: I have no idea.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I have no idea.  I mean I--it's interesting.  Yeah, I really have no idea.
Speaker 2: Was his last name Daniel at all or--
Speaker 1: It must have been Daniel because my grandmother's name, and my mother's maiden name is Daniel.  So, it must have been Daniel.
Story_ID: 27618
Speaker 1: So did your mother have any stories of growing up, what it was like for her growing up in Tobago?
Speaker 2: My mother [Carmella Daniel] pretty much kept all of that quiet.  She talked about her brother [Bertyl Daniel], which I'm not really sure she even--she never mentioned Philip [Francois, her mother's, Vio, lover], but I'm trying to remember if we even know that it [Bertyl Daniel] was her half brother.  We did have, we did know stories about Daddy Mack [her father] and the fact that Bertyl and Daddy Mack had an extremely--at least the abuse was one way from Daddy Mack to Bertyl.  And it was, you know, a continuation of that sort of domination that goes with people being objectified in slavery.  So I didn't, I didn't understand--she never mentioned how it affected her, which I think it really the relevant thing here.  I never really knew how it affected her until recently.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you grow up in that environment.  It has to affect you.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so her father picked on her half brother?
Speaker 2: I don't know that he picked on her.  I know that that household was highly combustible.  Fear was the major form of control, and those who felt fear, I'm mother did, but the immediate ones, were my grandmother--were her mother and Bertyl, her brother.  So it was not a happy--there was dysfunction from, at its very core.
Story_ID: 27619
Speaker 1: My grandmother, Vio, did not finish school.  She had Bertyl, and she had to take care of him.  So not being able to marry the one she loved [Philip Francois, Bertyl's father], she married someone who could provide, and that was, let's just call him Mr. Daniel, for lack of a better name.  So he was a farmer.  He farmed cocoa on the island.  I don't know the extent of the operation.  And my mother [Carmella Daniel] grew up in all of this and did not finish school.  She later did finish high school when she moved to the [United] States and she did finish college.  And then she became a history teacher in the local high school in Walla Walla [Washington].
Story_ID: 27620
Speaker 1: Okay, now, let me go to your father's side of the family.  Then we'll try to find out how they met.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is Hollibert Eastwald Phillips, H-O-L-L-I-B-E-R-T, E-A-S-T-W-A-L-D, and the last name I've spelled already.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a very British-sounding name, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean West Indian names are typically some British name with some twist, like I have a cousin whose name is Wintemore (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You get the idea.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, sir, yes, sir.  Now, when I hear the names, I can almost tell--
Speaker 2: You can always tell where it's from.
Speaker 1: If it's a black person, and they have a name like this, I can tell they're from the islands.
Speaker 2: They're from the islands, yes, from the British islands (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know either.  I know that's odd.  Most people would know, but I don't.  He's around, he's close to 80, I would say.
Speaker 1: Okay, so around--
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven, something like that I would say he is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So early '30s [1930s], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was also born in Tobago.
Speaker 1: Now, is he from the same town as your mother or--
Speaker 2: No, I don't know the town he was born in, but it would safe to say that he was born in Scarborough, the capital.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: My father's father was an Anglican--okay, so it clearly isn't that.  He had some position in the Anglican church, I'm told.  So he apparently was an organist.  I'm also told--I was also told that he was, he repaired shoes.  So I don't exactly know which one of these supported the family.  So on this side of the family, there were many more siblings.  My father had, has several brothers and a couple of sisters or maybe it was just one sister.  We didn't interact with his side of the family very much.  Not that we interacted very much with my mother's [Carmella Daniel] side of the family, but I do remember going to Granny Vio's [her mother] house.  This is Mr. Daniel's [her father] wife and that was the family that I remember Tobago being defined by.  I do not remember Tobago being defined by any family visitation on my father's side.  So, they apparently were from Barbados.  And apparently, people from Barbados have a rather, have a much stronger connection with England than the other people on the island.  So they tend to be stricter, not that--I mean the gradations we're talking about here aren't big (laughter) because the islands by definition are strict.  But it's, sort of taken up a couple of notches when you're Bar-, when you're, as they're called, Bajans.  Okay, so I don't really know a whole lot of details about my father's side.  I have studied much more on my mother's side because that's where I know the people, and I'm closer to them now, today.  But my father's side, I--the stories I hear is that his mother somehow died in childbirth at some point later on in life or, and there were too many children.  And he was sent off to live in, with some other relative.  And those scars have never been reversed on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, so does that explain the lack of visitation to his people, I mean his--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: It would explain on some level with no mother there, and usually, the mother is the anchor of the family--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --visits and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we never met anyone on his, on his side of the family.
Story_ID: 27621
Speaker 1: I never, I don't recall ever meeting him [my paternal grandfather].  I mean I don't recall.  And it's weird.  I don't know when they were born.  Well, it's, there're other reasons why I don't know that, but, you know, it's--the-the extended family beyond, so, what I mean by that is aunts, cousins, uncles, etc., so the extended family is, was in limbo as far as we were concerned (laughter), meaning it was never a Sunday outing with, oh, well, I'll go talk to my cousin.  I never had that concept of "cousin", "aunt".  There were friends that they had that we spent more time with than family members.
Speaker 2: Okay, so your father's [Hollibert Eastwald Phillips] friends are more familiar than your--
Speaker 1: I remember his friends more.
Speaker 2: Now, do you know who actually raised your father?  Was it a relative or--
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 27622
Speaker 1: Now, did your father [Hollibert Eastwald Phillips] have a chance to go to school and finish?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father was a star student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Many stories he tells about the huge sacrifices that, or the--I wouldn't say they were sacrifices, but the, the great effort that he had to put forth to be able to get an education and, you know, with very little support.  So having to borrow other people's books to be able to do the work because he, they couldn't afford the books, staying up late studying for all of the exams which were set in England, of course.  In those days, it was not independent.  So all of the exams were mailed over from England, and in fact, he has an ex--they have extern Bachelor's degrees.  I mean there's no university in--there was no university in Tobago at the time.  So he has a Bachelors of History from, which one is it?  University of London or, God, I can't remember.  Was it--I don't remember which one, but some university in England.  And he just took all of the work, he did all of the work correspondence.  And this was standard for people who were going to, who were excelling at the time to do their degrees externally.
Speaker 1: I would have thought he would have gone to the University of the West Indies or something--
Speaker 2: I don't think that was really set up back then.
Speaker 1: Well, I think it was--
Speaker 2: Fifties [1950s]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but--
Speaker 2: Well, that's not what he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, you know.
Story_ID: 27623
Speaker 1: All right, so your father [Hollibert Eastwald Phillips] now, so in Tobago, he achieved a BA in History from one of the universities in Britain?
Speaker 2: Right.  You know, but I think ultimately--it's unclear if that happened when he was in Tobago or if he, if he did that when we moved to Trinidad.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the family moved to Trinidad?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we moved at some point.  I forgot exactly when.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's, let me try to--okay, so your father did finish high school in Tobago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, yeah, he did, he did, he did.
Speaker 1: Now, did he meet your mother [Carmella Daniel]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause he met my mother in Tobago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Now, I guess it's a good time to ask now.  What is the story, is there a story that's passed down of how they met?  You know, some people have 'em, and some don't know.  But--
Speaker 2: There is no story that is passed down.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but they did meet in Tobago?
Speaker 2: They did meet in Tobago.
Speaker 1: Now, were they teenagers?
Speaker 2: She was.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so at ah, so did they get married--
Speaker 2: They were separated maybe three years in age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, three or four, I think.  And, of course, she quit school and started having children immediately.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And all of us were born in Tobago except my youngest sister who was born in Michigan.
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: Four.
Speaker 1: And what's the order?  What's the order?
Speaker 2: I have two older sisters who are twins, and I have a younger brother, and the youngest is my, is a, is my sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you were all born in Tobago before your parents moved to Trinidad?
Speaker 2: Except my youngest sister--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who was born in Michigan.  And then we returned back to Trinidad after that, and then finally moved to the States in '68 [1968].
Story_ID: 27624
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, what they look like, how they walk, how they talk, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: It's funny.  Ten years ago, I would have said my mother [Carmella Daniel], but now, I don't know.  I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you seem completely different from them both or do you see (laughter), it's a combination of--
Speaker 2: Things have really changed in the last 10 years (laughter).  There's been a moving away from that whole household.  And so I, I don't know anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know this is supposed to be a simple question, but there's a lot behind that question that I'm not saying (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well, this is for history, you know, so--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --for the sake of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I guess it is for history.  So I've become much more aware of my parents' dysfunction than I was, you know, even in the first 50 years of my life.  And the last four years, this has become front and center.  That is why I've become interested in what's the origin of all of the harshness in the West Indies?  What's the origin of their harshness?  So, I know I have elements in my personality that are definitely like them.  But being aware of this sort of makes you focus on other things rather than what is, eerily similar.  I mean I'm sure my--I have many habits that have been instilled from the West Indies.  You know, I mean it's not a school system that really fosters much deviation from strict adherence to what the teachers want.  And the expectations are very, are very clear.  So I know I have many, discipline I learned definitely in the school at a very early age, not necessarily how to channel that into a productive way because most of the education you get in the British West Indies at that time was very rote.  You learned a lot of facts, but--and it was through a lot of repetition, rote, necessarily, and repetition.  And so the ability to think creatively and analyze is not something that the education system really fosters.  But this is aside from your question.  Similarities with my parents are not something I think about right now.
Story_ID: 27625
Speaker 1: Thinking about where you grew up, I guess in your early days, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Definitely Tobago, the smells of the dock, the fish market, the smell of, you know, curry.  The smell of my grandmother's house.  You know, just the smell of the sea, you know.  These are the sorts of things that when I go back it's, and walking through the main market in Scarborough [capital of Tobago].  I mean that's it.  And those are very vivid.  And smell is the most, it's the one that's tied most to memory of the senses and so definitely, when I get--and the first time I went back to Trinidad, I made sure I took the boat from--the first time I went to Tobago, I took the boat from Trinidad to Tobago because that's what we did in those days.  We didn't fly.  I wanted to do that to sort of recreate the whole thing, and it smelled exactly the same.  It was sort of amazing.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you said earlier, you think you're color blind basically, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm not, colors are not something I, I can distinguish.  I can distinguish most, but I know I am sort of blind to certain colors.
Speaker 1: Now, do you mean this in the literal sense or figurative sense?  I mean do you--
Speaker 2: The literal sense.
Speaker 1: You actually, okay, you actually don't really see colors--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as such.  And so.  All right.  Okay, so, well, what about sights and sounds anyway (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, sights and sounds, okay.  So, steel band music, of course.  Sights, people drawing fish from the sea.  That's something that was very familiar, children playing in the playground, hearing how people talk.  It's very different than how people talk in the states.
Speaker 1: Can you give us an example on what Trinidadian--
Speaker 2: You caught the fish, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, is a Tobago, Tobago accent different from Trinidad's?
Speaker 2: It's the same.
Speaker 1: Same, okay, all right.  And can a West Indian tell the difference between a Jamaican accent and a Trinidadian?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, I figured people could, but I, you know, I don't, you know, myself, I can't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it's the difference between someone from Arkansas and someone from Oregon (laughter).
Story_ID: 27626
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So, now, growing up, now, did you live in the same neighborhood in Tobago, you know, when you were there, or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we lived in Scarborough.
Speaker 1: Scarborough, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And was there a name for your, the part of town you lived in?
Speaker 2: No, I mean it's, it's a small place.  We lived on Fort Street, which is one of the main streets in Scarborough.
Speaker 1: You said Ford or--
Speaker 2: Fort.
Speaker 1: Fort, okay, Fort Street, okay.  So I take it, was there a Fort there at--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, Fort George.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, what were the houses like, the housing like?
Speaker 2: Small, galvanized roofs, typically made of stone, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and have things changed much since you were there, you know, you grew up there, then, you know, and today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's more tourism, at least I'm more aware of it.  But still, it's very modest.  It's, you know, there are strange island in the sense that tourism is still not a major part of the economy.  And they're one of the few Caribbean Islands in which that is not the case.  So, have things changed?  They've tried to keep Tobago looking pretty much natural.  So there's a rule.  You can't build a house, build any structure that's taller than a coconut tree.  So whatever you build has to--so the whole layout hasn't changed.  It's still wide open spaces with coconut trees growing, goats and cows grazing, the sea right there.  So there are many more cars, yes.  And the roads are better, but the undulations of the terrain and the fact that you feel danger when you travel, in the sense that you have to be very careful when you drive, and all of those corners and those rickety bridges, all of that is still there.  It's not as if it's all become industrialized.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the essential rawness of the place is still there.
Speaker 1: Are the roads paved for the most part now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they are paved, but it's not as if you feel as though you're in, you know, on a four-lane highway.  It's still--there might be one central marking, but it's not as if there're guardrails on the sides (laughter).  It's still, it's still pretty much uncluttered.
Speaker 1: Is it a mountainous country or--
Speaker 2: Yes, it is, it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean it's, Tobago is maybe 24 miles long and it takes about an hour and a half to go from one end to the other.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it's high country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: With no guardrails (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No guardrails.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Lots of switch backs (unclear), okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it's fun, but, you know, it's, you have to not be in a hurry.
Speaker 1: All right, so people there on the island are basically not in a hurry or they--
Speaker 2: Not in a hurry.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so is there a, now, is the Indian population like large.  We mentioned them before we started.
Speaker 2: Right, so the Indian population lives mainly in Trinidad, not Tobago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tobago is more African, although there are, you know, there is a significant number.  It's much more so, it, their pre--their presence is much bigger in Trinidad.  Half the population--so 80 percent of the population is split evenly between Africans and Indians.  And that's a product of indentured servitude which started after slavery ended.
Story_ID: 27627
Speaker 1: Now, you started school in Tobago, right?
Speaker 2: Right, I finished the equivalent of the--so I was 10 when we left, and when we came to the [United] States, I went into the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Right, that sounds about right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: What was the name of your first school in Tobago?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because we were in school in Trinidad at the time.  I did not actually go to school in Tobago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were in Trinidad, and we lived in the town called San Juan or as they say in Tobago, Sahwah, so I don't, the San Juan Elementary School, or I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so you started there and then the family moved back to Tobago?
Speaker 2: No, once we moved to Trinidad, we did not move back.
Speaker 1: Oh, so the next move was actually Boston then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a short stay in Michigan, but then we moved back and then the final move was to Boston.
Speaker 1: So you actually went to Michigan first?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was six or something like that.  It was just a year and a half.
Speaker 1: Now, what part of Michigan?
Speaker 2: East, no, what part of Michigan?  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Is it near Detroit?
Speaker 2: Berrien Springs.
Speaker 1: Berrien Springs, right.  That's right.  That's near Chicago, not too far from Chicago.  That's where--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Mohammed Ali had his training camp.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, there you go.
Story_ID: 27628
Speaker 1: Saint, was that St. Andrews College, the Seven Day Adventist--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Seven Day Adventist university there.  It's called Andrews University.
Speaker 1: Andrews University, okay.
Speaker 2: My father was there.
Speaker 1: Now, there we go.
Speaker 2: Okay, yes.
Speaker 1: These things are not so obscure (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So that's, is that why he moved to--
Speaker 2: That's why he, so I think he was getting a Masters degree, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: So was he in the SDA [Seventh Day Adventist]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Seventh Day Adventist?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we were all raised that way.
Speaker 1: All right, so he was an SDA.
Speaker 2: But he converted because he was raised Anglican, which is the religion of most people on the island 'cause it's British.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said before his father was an organist in the Anglican church.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's from Barbados, and the Bajans [people from Barbados] are, their adherence to England is, and their emotional ties, structural ties is much greater.
Speaker 1: Something about the SDA, the SDA prides itself on bringing as many foreign nationals to their colleges as possible.  I've been to Apple Valley Market at Andrews University--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --that is famous for being the only place in that region where you can get food from all over the world.
Speaker 2: Ahhh.
Speaker 1: And the students are the workers,--
Speaker 2: Workers, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the employees in Apple Valley Market.  They're from everywhere.  That's where I first saw those little red bananas and other things that they--
Speaker 2: Well, it's because Seventh Day Adventists are proselytizers.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, given that, you have to increase your numbers.
Speaker 1: Yes, and I guess one of the hooks is a chance to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --come to the U.S. or come to some--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They have, you know, it's standard for college students to go out and take a year off and be a missionary in some part of the world and make contacts there.  And it continues today.  In fact, that's why the largest profession that Seventh Day Adventists are known for is medicine, and that wasn't--that's not an accident.  It was to increase the chance of being of service to people around the world.  You go there as a missionary doctor.  So.
Speaker 1: Right, so this is--so SDA, so that, okay.  That makes sense.  So he's, he's in Berrien Springs, Michigan, an area that's well known to the Chicago community, you know, 'cause so many, I know there're a lot of African American have like real estate, summer homes, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Okay, I see.
Speaker 1: --middle-class people have summer homes in that area, Berrien Springs and the area.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.
Speaker 1: So at any rate, even those who don't, you know, are familiar with going up there to buy produce in the fall.  There're a lot of black farmers in that part of Michigan too, to tell the truth.  I don't know what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was really young when I was there.  I, I don't--except for it being cold, that was the first time I really saw snow, I don't remember it very well at all.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Benton Harbor, all that area--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do remember names like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyway, so we established that.  So he, so he was up there working on a--now, he was working at Andrews University or--
Speaker 2: He was a student.
Speaker 1: Student, okay.
Speaker 2: So he was getting a Masters, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was part of the SDA, you know, offices in Trinidad or something like that.  And so he was, yeah, the SDA's have a, quite, quite an operation going on in Trinidad.  And he was part of that whole thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what phase of his-- what concentration of history was he focused on?  Was it British history, American history, what?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause that's not what he ended up studying later on.
Story_ID: 27629
Speaker 1: But you were in Berrien Springs for about a year and a half?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then on to Boston, right?
Speaker 2: No, then we moved back to Trinidad.
Speaker 1: Oh, back to Trinidad, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: For another four years maybe--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --three years.
Speaker 1: So where does that, all right, okay.  So you didn't move to Boston, you said, till '68' [1968]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, so all right, so this time in the middle--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --so you went to school in Michigan, I guess for a little while?
Speaker 2: It's funny, I don't really remember going to school in Michigan (laughter).  I mean I really don't.  I don't--hold it a minute.  I might be able to figure this out.  My younger sister is six years younger than I am.  No, I can't figure it out from just one point.  I need to know something more than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just don't remember.  And my school I remember being in Trinidad.  I don't remember being schooled in Toba--in Michigan, although, we might have.  I just--
Speaker 1: You certainly would have been a school age, right, if you started--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know, which is funny because I have no recollection of school in Michigan, yeah.
Speaker 1: Maybe you were there before you started school in Trinidad.  Maybe that was it.
Speaker 2: I don't remember, and it's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, at any rate--
Speaker 2: --hard to piece it together.
Speaker 1: --you go back to Trinidad, and did you go back to the same school and everything in Trinidad when you went back?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Not San Juan?
Speaker 2: San Juan.
Speaker 1: Okay, then, now, did your father get a--so did he achieve his Masters degree at Andrews University when he was there?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I think so.
Speaker 1: All right.  So when he goes to--
Speaker 2: I was really young and I haven't really--I don't, I never sought out those details.  I mean the ones that were obvious, like, you know, when I, we moved to the states, those details about my father are much more--
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1968 when you were 10 years old, the family moves to Boston, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so everybody moves to Boston?
Speaker 2: Everyone moved.
Speaker 1: And, all right, Boston, did your--there are a lot of Bajans [people from Barbados] Boston.  You know, I think that's the number one group from the West Indies that's in the Boston area.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, everybody's from Barbados.
Speaker 2: I see.  I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Lots of achievers too and we've interviewed so many that have ancestry in Barbados.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27630
Speaker 1: So, what did your father do in Boston?
Speaker 2: He was a graduate student at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was BU [Boston University], and now did you all arrive before Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated or around the same time or afterwards?
Speaker 2: We arrived--what's interesting is my father's birthday is the day, is the, you know, the--is the day King was shot (laughter).
Speaker 1: April 4th.
Speaker 2: April 4th.  (laughter)  And only recently I discovered this, sort of something I should have known a long time ago, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So we arrived shortly after he was shot.  I think we were in Michigan when [president] John F. Kennedy was.
Speaker 1: That's '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Yeah, '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: So you would have been five, I guess or so, five, maybe just on the verge of starting school?
Speaker 2: Five, six, yeah, something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  All right.  So maybe you went to pre-school in Trinidad and then--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I really don't know.  So that's, that was it.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) going to school in Michigan.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27631
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so your dad was, your family's in Boston.  Did you go to school in Boston?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So do you remember where you went?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  I was, I went to Edward E. Devotion School in Coolidge Corner in Brookline, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Edward E--what's it called?
Speaker 2: Edward E. Devotion School.
Speaker 1: Devotion, okay.
Speaker 2: Someone's name.  In fact, it was the same school that [President] John F. Kennedy went to (laughter) as a kid--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --because they lived in Brookline, and his, his--some family member lived down the street from the school at the time that I was going there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was very different in the states because we went from this very rote kind of learning in the British system, very old school, saying all your times tables and things like that, to this New Math [A brief change in the teaching style of mathematics in the United States during the 1960s].  That was the thing at the time.  And I had no idea what new math was all about.  I still don't (laughter), not that it matters.
Speaker 1: Okay, so New Math didn't really stick (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, I mean I was very bad at it. I remember I, I--yeah, I just didn't know what was--a very different set of, the curriculum was just very different.  And I, you know, and 10 in the sixth grade in the states is very young.  I, what I'd learned in the Caribbean was equivalent to what would have gotten me ready for the sixth grade.  But the system there is, you know, it's, it's very standard.  So you know what you have to do to get to certain grades, whereas in the states it was much looser, I would say.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  So, the New Math was supposed to reinforce like a new era in STEM education, you know, in the United States, following Sputnik [the first artificial satellite, which was launched by Russia] and all that, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was after that, yeah, that was the initial motivation.  But it didn't really catch on, did it?  (laughter) It didn't, it didn't catch on.  I mean it was like (laughter), yeah.
Story_ID: 27632
Speaker 1: So, so, you were, you were there in Boston for, you said a couple of years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just two years.
Speaker 1: Two years, till 1970.
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: And, so did your father finish his--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he finished his Ph.D..
Speaker 1: His Ph.D., okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He finished his Ph.D. at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts].  This is the same place that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] got his Ph.D..
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: And his birthday on the same day that Dr. King was assassinated.  And, I mean I don't know.  These are all just coincidences that may--
Speaker 2: It's an interesting thing that I found out four months ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a sense when you were that age of who Dr. King was?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, absolutely.  I remember reading books about Dr. King.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so we--
Speaker 2: I didn't quite understand the whole racism thing, but I knew how important he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, there were three black leaders who I remember distinctly from my childhood.  The first was Haile Selassie [Ethiopia's regent] 'cause we were kids when we saw his motorcade drive by the Savannah in Trinidad, in Port of Spain.  And Eric Williams, of course, and then Dr. King.
Speaker 1: Eric Williams, being the president of Trinidad.
Speaker 2: The prime minister.
Speaker 1: Prime minister, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27633
Speaker 1: Okay, so your father got his--now, he got his Ph.D. in history or--
Speaker 2: Well, he got, he got a doctor of education degree, but he worked for someone in the philosophy department.  So he essentially became a philosopher.
Speaker 1: Well, that's interesting.  Okay.  So, so when he--now, did he, was he picked up by a university--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was picked up by a Seventh Day Adventist university in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to teach education and philosophy.
Speaker 1: And what school was this?
Speaker 2: Walla Walla College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Walla Walla, Washington.  That explains why we went to Washington.
Speaker 1: All right, Walla Walla College.  Okay, all right, so you're at Walla Walla College in 1970, right, I mean Walla Walla, Washington in 1970?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, now what was Walla Walla like in 1970 for--
Speaker 2: A very white place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very different from, I mean it was--there were very few blacks.  Our neighbors were not very welcoming.  Those were my initial memories of Walla Walla.  And they definitely tried to move us out of the neighborhood.  They offered us things like stale milk, thinking that that would be something we would use.  It was not very kind, and it was very different from Boston because I remember Boston not having that sort of reception.  We lived in Brookline, which was distinctly Jewish in those days, and all of my friends were Jewish.  And that was my impression of Boston, is that it was a Jewish place, which is completely (laughter) not the case (laughter), you know.  You know, and Jews are fairly receptive people, and so being black in a Jewish neighborhood didn't seem like a big deal.  But being black in a small town in southeastern Washington was a big deal.  So that's really the first time I became really aware of being black in America.  That certainly did not happen in Boston because my friends were all very, you know, it just didn't matter.  And I still know many of those friends I had from the Boston days.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any other black people at all in Walla Walla?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) None that I recall (laughter).  Yeah, there was another--I don't remember if we predated his arrival or if he came after (laughter).  It was a professor there, of English, Nathan Moore, who was also from the West Indies, also from Trinidad, I think.  And he, and we became very good friends with him.
Speaker 1: Did he have a family or was it just him?
Speaker 2: Well, he and his wife.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had a Canadian wife, and we, you know, we all became very, very good friends.  (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's interesting to be the only black person in town is--I've heard that story before.
Speaker 2: Yeah, if look, you're the only black person in the town in 1970, small town in 1970, there will be problems.  And, of course, I think my parents were in a state of denial over, over all of that.
Story_ID: 27634
Speaker 1: So, well, how was school?  How were you treated in school?
Speaker 2: Okay, so, you know, kids at that age aren't really that much affected by race.  It's mainly the adults.  So school was fine.  I had teachers who I learned a lot from.  I was very interested in math in those days, and I felt as though I got a good grounding in things without any distractions that were, could necessarily be related to race.  I felt it was fairly straightforward, the school, and I definitely liked that.  The town was a different thing, but the school was, I thought, fairly separate from that.
Speaker 1: Well, as a kid growing up in an environment like that, I mean did you have, were you able to do things socially with the, with your classmates or did you pretty much stay with the nuclear family?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, we associated, we had friends.  But the most important thing in who our friends ended up being was that they were Seventh Day Adventists [SDA].  I don't know if you know very much about Seventh Day Adventists, but they're an extremely nuclear group that thinks that everyone who's not a Seventh Day Adventist is not worthy of their time or they would be worthy of their time if they were to convert to Seventh Day Adventism.  So, right, so they definitely viewed themselves as the chosen people, and something that's very real for them.  So if our friends were Seventh Day Adventists, that was the major filter.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: And since most of them were faculty kids, that was, you know, we were very good friends with this one music family.  So, you know, we definitely had associations with, yeah, I mean I didn't see an immediate barrier to forming friends of the faculty kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they would all--they would feel almost obligated to associate with other SDA families?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean all of them were not receptive in hindsight, but, you know, it--that was certainly the immediate group.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that would be the reason for them to--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --make sure that they kept in touch--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --with you, yeah.
Story_ID: 27635
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did you like to do growing up?
Speaker 2: What did I like to do?  I liked to do growing up?  Well, I sort of, I mean I played with my brother.  I played baseball.  I, you know, we had to spend a lot of time at home.  They didn't want us going anywhere.  So we had to come up with games to play at home.  And, you know, we'd just find various things and try to make things, you know, and make do with less.  And eventually, I would end up borrowing tennis rackets from this West Indian family, and that's how I ended up playing tennis.  I borrowed--I saw he had some tennis rackets in his garage, and I convinced my brother that we should go out and play tennis.  And tennis is something that I've done ever since.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a bigger, a bigger town that your family would visit close by or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I'm not sure of Walla Walla [Washington].  I'm trying to think where Walla Walla is in relation to Seattle or--
Speaker 2: So, it's four and a half hours southeast.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The precise location of Walla Walla which would give you a mental image of where it is, is the following:  It is a mile North or Oregon and about twenty miles West of Idaho.
Speaker 1: Okay, it kind of gives you an idea, yeah.  Yeah, they're very few, I never even been to that (part of the?) country (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  There's no reason for you to have ever been there.  And you will never go there (laughter).  But that gives you an idea, twenty miles West of Idaho.
Speaker 1: I see, yes.
Speaker 2: One mile north of Oregon.  It's in the desert.  There's nothing else there.
Speaker 1: Really?  It's in a desert landscape.
Speaker 2: Desert landscape.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, so was church a big part of growing up?  Since, obviously--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Church was definitely a part of growing up.  You definitely had to, had to do that.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church there?
Speaker 2: The Walla Walla College Seventh Day Adventist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was the college church.
Speaker 1: SDA, they're vegetarians too, aren't they, for the most part?
Speaker 2: It depends where they live.  In the U.S., they typically are.  In the Caribbean, no.
Story_ID: 27636
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So did, so did you like to read when you were growing up?  Did you read a lot?
Speaker 2: I didn't really read a lot.  I didn't find books that interesting.  I remember getting very interested in evolution when I was very young.  And so I was interested in books that--it's really funny, either about some idea or about horses.  And I, I don't know what was this fascination with horses.  I think it was sort of motion probably.  But as high school started, that's when I started reading philosophy.  So I wanted books that were about something substantive.
Speaker 1: Would you have like discussions about philosophy with our father?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He would talk.  I would listen.
Speaker 1: All right.  So it sounds like a very strict sort of--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --situation, yeah.
Speaker 2: He might have thought they were conversations, but they weren't.  I think the reason I was interested in philosophy, and I was the only kid who actually ended up being interested in philosophy was so that I could counteract my father.  I was trying to overcome the ever presence, the overpowering presence that philosophy had in the family, which he wielded over us.
Speaker 1: Now, does the SDA or your parents have any feelings about evolution?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  They were, we were raised, you know, it's a literal interpretation of the bible.  So, one of the things that always confused me when I was growing up is how is philosophy consistent with Seventh Day Adventism?  I mean, so I knew, I knew the literal interpretation of the bible was wrong (laughter), and (unclear)I was interested in evolution.  So I pretty much determined that animals had, had to have evolved, and so I was trying to figure out plants and all of that.  And so I was--I remember reading this book called 'The Missing Link', and I think my parents definitely wanted me to put that book down.
Story_ID: 27637
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so how were your grades in school?
Speaker 2: In grade school, they were fine.  High school was a bit of a problem.  I did not do well in science at all in high school.  I was a very poor student in chemistry and physics, and I got C's and D's.  And math, I was very good in, and English, I was very good in.  And the rest just didn't matter.
Speaker 1: Now, I read that your reflection was that you didn't really have very good instruction in the sciences in high school?
Speaker 2: It was a, I think it was a combination of two things.  One, I needed a more mathematical explanation for what was going on.  And that was just not coming from the teachers.  It was a more intuitive picture that they were painting which didn't have a lot of, I would say, intellectual clarity behind it.  It wasn't something that if you learned that explanation would allow you, would give you ownership of the material.  It was something that they understood, but I didn't see it as the real explanation.  So I, I was not of--yeah, I, it's, given how I did in high school, it's a shock I ended up being a physicist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But math, I was very good at.  I mean that was always the thing that was, you know, it was very--
Speaker 1: So you're saying that their--I mean the way science was taught, it was kind of soft in terms of--it wasn't really scientific--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I remember the physics teacher saying, (unclear), it was always very Socratic.  So what do you think is the answer?  And, you know, the reason I'm asking you that question (laughter), Mr. Dennis, is that I don't know the answer.  And I don't even know how to think about the problem.  And so I remember learning absolutely zero in physics in high school, zero, 'cause I got to college, and I took a physics class as a junior.  And I didn't even know what a Newton was, you know, the unit of force.  I didn't even know what, yeah, I mean it's, so--didn't even know what a joule was, a unit of energy.  I mean you should know these things if you took physics in high school.  And I don't even remember ever even hearing the concept, but I'm sure I had to because there was one thing you do in physics in high school, and that's mechanics.  And so you need to know these concepts.  But I don't recall it being anything systematic that you could say at the end of the day, you know, I can explain this to you.  So, 'cause I could explain math to people, but I couldn't explain any--and chemistry was even worse.  It was just a bunch of cooking instructions.
Speaker 1: Recipes and (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Recipes and things like that.  I didn't know there was any system behind it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I needed the system for me to say that I understood something.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you graduated from high school from, was this Walla Walla High School, right?
Speaker 2: Walla Walla High School.
Speaker 1: Walla Walla High School, when you graduated, did you, your grades were kind of mediocre, I guess, in terms of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I'd begun to turn things around, but--yeah, math and--I'm sorry, chemistry and physics (laughter) definitely, it was abysmal.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't have any honors or anything at graduation or did you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, I was the opposite of the Valedictorian, not the opposite, but, you know, I was--I think I had a 3-something average [grade point average]--
Speaker 1: That's interesting--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --3.3 maybe.  Maybe it was a 3.5.  I don't know.  I had lots of low grades.
Story_ID: 27638
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, you went to Walla Walla College.  Were you living at home?
Speaker 2: And I lived at home.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right--
Speaker 2: All four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Except for the last two quarters.  The last two quarters being from January until May.  So except for five months, I lived at home.
Speaker 1: Well, so, what was your major in college?
Speaker 2: Math and chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you were there in--were you involved in, it was the same basic racial makeup of, I mean was the college reflective of the racial makeup of Walla Walla basically too?  Were you the only black student?
Speaker 2: There were some black students, very, very few.  A smattering of students from the [United] States and some from the islands and Africa, I would say, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, was college, did you, did you get--well, you had understanding in college, I guess, because you said you were learning things you should have learned in high school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in college.  So did college turn you on to physics or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean once I got to college, and I started taking--so I started college an English major.  And then I decided, you know, 'cause I really wanted to write.  That was my, that was a passion of mine.  And, but I decided I wasn't talented enough to be a writer.  Then I decided I'll be a math major.  And, and then I--math didn't seem very hard.  Basically, I was, I should have taken calculus in high school.  I was not really performing at the level that I should have been performing at.  And so when I got to college and was taking calculus, then I started the standard sequence of calculus in college, by the third quarter, I decided, you know, this is not very hard.  And I'm going to drop it and go and do something else.   So a very interesting story happened.  I was on the way to the registrar's office to drop calculus, and I see a kid with a skateboard, and I decided I was going to drop calculus which was four units and replace it with Western's, History of Western Civilization 'cause I hadn't taken my general history requirement, and, and add, there was a physical education class that was required and add PE.  And I was going to add a tennis course, and that would be four hours.  On the way to drop, to the registrar's office, I see a kid on a skateboard.  Skateboards were really a big thing back then.  I asked the kid, can I borrow your skateboard and just, could I try it out?  He goes, sure.  So I hop on the skateboard, go careening around the corner, fall off, and I completely tear up my ankle.  I have to be in a cast for eight weeks, which means I couldn't go through with my plan to go and drop calculus.  It completely changed the course that I was on.
Speaker 1: So you actually had to take--you took calculus?
Speaker 2: I couldn't go through with my plan of replacing a four-unit course with a, with a class that required that I go, that I do some sort of exercise.  So Western Civ[ilization] and tennis went out the window and I stuck with calculus.  And had I not done that, I would probably not be here right now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So the kid with the skateboard--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The kid with the skateboard completely, that was a very pivotal moment.
Speaker 1: You were a junior then, you said?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I was a, that was the end of my freshman year.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right, so 1970-what?
Speaker 2: I started college in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Seventy-five [1975]--
Speaker 2: So it was '76 [1976], Spring of '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so because of that I, I was on the standard math sequence that all of the serious science and engineering people were on, and so the next year, I took chemistry.  And it seemed trivial.  It seemed absolutely easy.  There was--it was taught with a system behind it.  And so then I, I decided I would major in chemistry.  And, but I was sort of behind because I was taking general chemistry my second year in college.  And I hadn't taken physics yet.  So we're talking serious catch-up here.  And so I take more chemistry classes during the summer and then the fall, I took physical chemistry.  This is as a junior, and I decided I would take the engineering physics sequence, which is the calculus-based course.  You know, this thing that you teach--I teach here to freshmen.  I didn't take it until my junior year (laughter).  And even that seemed easy, and it seemed more interesting than chemistry.  So I thought, well, you know, maybe I really should be a physics major.  So in the end, I ended up being a double major in math and chemistry, and I took several physics courses, independent study, because there were very few people majoring in physics.  And so you had to arrange with the professors to go and take these courses.  So I was taking the quantum mechanics course independent study, my senior year and taking advance math courses also independent study.  So basically in a two-year period, I went from no physics, to taking advance physics courses.  And so I almost had a physics major when I finished as well, but I didn't have time to do any of the labs or anything like that.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a crash course, once I figured it out.
Story_ID: 27639
Speaker 1: So about 1980, so when you graduated in 1980--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1979.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, that's when you go on to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], right?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I went on to University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay, University of Washington, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I went there to study theoretical chemistry.  And I was a graduate student there for three years, and after that I went to Berkley.
Speaker 1: Now, just to rewind back and something I didn't ask about.  You said that you lived at home until the last two months or--
Speaker 2: Four months.
Speaker 1: --four months of your senior year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened?  What happened?
Speaker 2: What happened?  I decided, I was the sort of person that did things only if I thought my parents would approve of it.  And I didn't think they would have approved of my moving out to go to the dorms like the rest of my other siblings did.  And I mean at some point, you realize you're the only one living at home (laughter), the only kid going to college living at home.  So I thought it would be certainly okay at the end to go and live--there was a house that became available and some science people were in it.  And my parents knew them, and I said, you know, I think I want to go live in this house with these kids.  And they said, fine.  But it was fear of disappointing them that I lived at home.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean, well, you--it seems like you're taking a lot on yourself.  Your brothers and sister--I mean, you know, your other siblings left, right?
Speaker 2: They all left.  I did not.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I was the one who put all of this on me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Only recently have I begun to move away from that.
Story_ID: 27640
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], so you're there to study theoretical chemistry?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the--well, before we leave Walla Walla [Washington], was there any particular teacher or a mentor there that really, you remember that really excited you or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were two that really excited--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --me in college.  One was my general chemistry teacher, Dr. Chin.  His explanation of the periodic chart was pivotal.  I began to see that there was a system behind all of these elements, and you could understand patterns.  And so that's when I decided I wanted to be theoretical scientist.  It was actually then.  Yeah, that was when I decided--and I remember I came home and told my parents, I want to, I want to become a scientist.  And the first reaction was, you're being completely unrealistic, verbatim.
Speaker 1: Was that based on what they perceived as your past as a science student or--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  They perceived it as unrealistic, given what they wanted.  They wanted me to go to medical school 'cause they have to say profession.  And he could point to a definite end to the studies and definite employment.
Speaker 1: Yes, and what, what immigrant family is not proud to have a son that's a doctor? (laughter)
Speaker 2: And then he could count the number of doctors, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  This is a familiar story with people we interview and who go into science, that their parents wanted them to be doctors instead.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, so at any rate, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But I knew at that point that I was going to be a scientist, sophomore year in college.  I knew I was gonna be a scientist.  I knew I'd be a theoretician.
Speaker 1: Now, who was your other mentor?  Dr. Chin in chemistry and--
Speaker 2: There was a physics professor who--I took general physics with him, and then I sort of liked the way he thought about things, very--he had a lot of physical intuition.  And I realized I had math intuition.  I did not have physical intuition.  I sort of--yeah, I don't remember his name very well.  I remember one of his names was Gordon, but I don't remember if that was his first name or his last name (laughter).  I haven't thought about him in a while.  Yeah, he taught a great course in physics, absolutely great.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I definitely learned to think about things.  I knew that there was a, there was a higher way of thinking about physics, other than just viewing it as an exercise in math.  And I knew I could not do that.  So that is what sort of pushed me on, trying to get to that point.
Story_ID: 27641
Speaker 1: All right, so the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], this is 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine [1979] to '82 [1982] I was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979], okay.
Speaker 2: --a graduate student there.
Speaker 1: All right, 1979 to '82 [1982].  Okay, well, now, were there any special teachers at the University of Washington?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: David Boulware, physics professor.  I took all of my physics courses from him, except one, but all the--yeah, I took classical mechanics, math methods, quantum field theory, all from David Boulware, absolutely fabulous teacher.  I was inspired, in awe.  He, he was a student of Julian Schwinger's and students of Schwinger--Schwinger was one of the great protege physicists who won a Nobel Prize.  And so, but he was incredibly good at computing.  I mean sort of a math whiz type.  And so he invented various ways of computing things that he imparted at the--that his students learned from him.  And so when we took classes from--people who take classes from Schwinger students are essentially learning Schwinger.  And so that's what I had got.  I mean it was like a year and a half of Schwinger, and it was, it definitely put me on a course that was, that is still present now (laughter).  So, yeah, he was the most important teacher.  My advisor was less of a teacher.  I learned how to get things done.  So my advisor was Ernie [Ernest] Davidson, and I learned how to approach an unsolved problem, break it apart and have the confidence to put together a solution.  And I learned how to do that repeatedly.  So I learned how to do science.  I ended up not being very interested in the area that I got my Ph.D. in, and I told him that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he supported me.  I, I was able to get this very nice fellowship at Berkeley that allowed me to sort of change fields.
Story_ID: 27642
Speaker 1: Now, you got your Ph.D. in chemistry, right, in math?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I got my Ph.D. in chemistry.
Speaker 1: Chemistry, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Right, I have no degree in physics.
Speaker 1: Right, and your dissertation was about phosphorescence lifetimes and small molecules--
Speaker 2: Right.  A completely useless topic.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Is it really?
Speaker 2: It's a completely useless, useless thesis.  And for most people a thesis is something really meaningful that their life has led them to this.  No.  For me, it was I thought of an idea as a graduate student.  I asked my professor, do you think this would work out?  He goes, yes, a reasonable idea, something he was interested in.  He had expertise in it so he could help me if I got stuck.  But it was not a, it was not--there was no big idea there.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you--I mean was it just impractical at one point, at some point to try to get a Ph.D. in physics, to work on a physics problem?
Speaker 2: I kept changing.  It was like in college.  I didn't have the confidence when I left high school to go and major in physics or chemistry.  It was like, let me take these classes and see how things go.  And as I kept taking classes, I realized I could do it.  And, but it was too late to get a major.  So when I got to--but I knew I wanted to do science.  So, and I wanted to do something mathematical.  So theoretical chemistry was the only option I had.  I didn't want to do math, but, you know, I wanted to do science.  So theoretical chemistry was the thing I chose.  But then I realized that from all these classes I took from [David] Boulware [physics professor at University of Washington, Seattle, Washington] that physics, that's the real thing.  That has all the ideas.  That has deep--physics is about laws.  It's about deep phenomenology.  You understand the way things work.  Chemistry just seemed to be a bunch of details, and I--so I knew ultimately, I would have to leave chemistry.  And that's what I ended up doing ultimately.  It was a slow process, but my evolution was pretty much set from what happened in high school, you know.  But it would have to be an evolution if I ended up, if I ever ended up being a physicist.
Speaker 1: So the dissertation on 'Phosphorescence Lifetimes and Small Molecules', is that theoretical chemistry?
Speaker 2: Yes, theoretical chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In some countries, in Europe, for example, that would be viewed as theoretical physics.  But it's not.  I mean let's just face it.  It's, there's no--it's a computation that requires some analytical ability but there's not, there's no phenomenon that you really are--and phenomenology is well understood.  It was a computation.  There's no idea that I was really trying to explore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was no experiment I was really trying to explain that was not understood.  So, it was rather divorced from reality, I would say.
Speaker 1: So what were you doing?  You were coming up with a mathematical model of how--
Speaker 2: I was doing a calculation.
Speaker 1: Of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I had figured out how to--there was an expression for how to calculate a phosphorescence lifetime, and I devised a diagrammatic way, summing finament diagrams to get the answer.  And there were like 450 diagrams you had to go and evaluate.  I figured out how to write the computer program to go and do all of this and calculate the answer.  But I got some number.  And, you know, I--and it wasn't right, and I had to go and--of course, it wouldn't be right.  I'm doing (laughter) perturbation theory in the wrong thing.  So it was just not the thing to do, okay.  And I didn't really understand that it wasn't the right thing to do.  And that was sort of interesting, well, sad really, but I knew that ultimately this sort of, this sort of area of science in which you're after numbers, and you're after--and it's the accuracy with which you get the number, that kind of approach, that kind of question was not what I was interested in.  Now, people like numbers, but I, the exact value, I don't care too much about.  And that's what my, my advisor, that was what he had made his life doing, better and better computational methods to get accurate numbers for ionization potentials in atoms.  Now, there's something, there's a lot of machinery in, you know, and things you have to develop.  But I was not interested in that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 27643
Speaker 1: What ideas intrigued you in those days?  When you, what were you really wanting to work on--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and what did you focus on?
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you do a good, apparently, you do a decent job, you know, in this Ph.D. dissertation 'cause you end up teaching at--
Speaker 2: Yeah, look, I, I did very well.  I mean I am--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --very good at getting things done, whether or not I have any interest in it (laughter).  Now, that's something I learned from my West Indian past (laughter).  Okay, so to me the Ph.D. didn't have to be meaningful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a means to an end.
Speaker 1: But you had your Ph.D..
Speaker 2: It was a means, it was a way of understanding what research was and how to go and do it.  It didn't tell me what was interesting.  So what was I interested in?
Speaker 1: Well, it got you a Miller Fellowship to the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, look--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --University of [California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I did very well, okay.  But to my mind, I was incompetent because I couldn't answer basic questions about science.  I couldn't answer simple things about, you know, why does the melting curve for water look the way it does?  You know, why is it slopped that way rather than this way?  And if I couldn't answer deep questions about phenomenology, I felt as I wasn't really a scientist.  You know, I couldn't care less about computing numbers.  Could you explain phenomen--you know, phenomena, is what I really wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were in a position with this Miller Fellowship, this post-doc to explore some of the questions you really wanted to explore?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so the Miller Fellowship, it wasn't working with a given professor.  It was a fellowship in an institute.  And after, at the time, it was after two years, you could do anything you wanted to do for two years.  But that was it.  It could never be extended.  So I decided that's when I would sort of make the change to study more mini-body systems and which had collective phenomena at their heart.  And so that's when I really started doing, that's when I started really doing statistical mechanics and then ended up focusing on things which were closely tied to my current area which is solid state physics.  So I was interested in phase transitions.  I mean the big idea at the time was how one could treat things in which degrees of freedom were--in which individual constituents were relevant, but it was the collective behavior of the system.  And this is, this was the method there was invented by Ken [Kenneth] Wilson, the renormalization group.  And that was the big idea.  And I wanted to learn that idea.  Everyone wanted to learn that idea.
Story_ID: 27644
Speaker 1: Critical phenomena is, was the big question until Ken [Kenneth] Wilson solved that problem in 1970--let me see.  Let's say the mid-70s [1970s].  I think '75 [1975] he wrote the first paper, '76 [1976], and then the big paper was '79 [1979], the epsilon expansion.  Okay, so critical phenomena is, happens in lots of things, you know, water, when you boil water, okay, it goes from--you change from one state of matter to another.  You put water in a, in the freezer.  It freezes.  You go from one state of matter to another.  How does that happen?  That's the question underlying, that's the underlying phenomena that Wilson was ultimately trying to address.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, in that instance, in the case with water--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --we know that temperature is a factor--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --in this, okay, so, but what is, what was Ken Wilson trying to figure?
Speaker 1: Okay, so if you look microscopically at what's going on, you see that the individual parts of the system are irrelevant.  It's the collective behavior of the system.  So it turns out that when something undergoes a phase transition, there's a length, there's a length scale that is blowing up.  So the phenomena is not--the phenomenon is not described by looking at one particular constituent, but you have to look at all of them together.  And so this, this required a new idea.  It required an idea that ultimately said that you have to somehow forget about certain, looking at systems under one sort of scale.  You have to look at them under, says actually all scales.  And I'm not explaining this very well 'cause I didn't really think I would be explaining critical phenomena today.  But, anyway, so the bottom line is the following, that if you look in a microscope at systems undergoing phase transitions, they exhibit what is called "collective phenomena".  And people have known this from the very early days, critical opalescence is a phenomenon of, you know, systems undergoing certain kinds of phase transitions.  And so it's an, it's a--the physics there is the physics of emergence in which the system is bigger than the sum of its parts.
Story_ID: 27645
Speaker 1: So, okay, so what I'm actually trying to say is the following that trying to understand systems right at the point where you go from one phase to the other, there's no distinction between the two unless--in some cases, there is, but if you are trying to understand how you go from one phase to another, you can't get away from the fact that the system exhibits what's called "scale and variance", that if you look at the system on this scale, on that scale and on that scale, it all looks the same.  So if you do a, so, in other words, if you, if you look at snowflakes, snowflakes are scale and variant.  Any sort of microscopic cut you make into a snowflake is exactly the same pattern as the actual snowflake.  And that's a pro--that was a new thing that people had discovered was also going on in systems that were changing from one phase to another.  And describing that mathematically was what the renormalization group allowed you to do, and that was the big idea at the time.  So, to this--here's an example of, of a sort of, of emergence.  If you look at rubber, rubber comes out of a tree, but there's no way that you can make a car tire out of the stuff that comes out of a tree just by taking the stuff out of a tree 'cause what comes out of a tree are individual strands of rubber and these long polymers.  And it's fairly elastic, and it doesn't have the hardness of a car tire.  You have to undergo a process called vulcanization, which you heat it with sulfur and what happens is, these individual strands begin to form something that looks like this.  So they cross link, and it's that cross linking that gives rubber the hardness that allows you to make car tires out of it.  Now, that's a very distinct state than the stuff that comes out of the tree.  And that's a phase transition.  You go from this collimated thing to this.  And that requires--and in this state, you can't tell the story of the thing that you drive your car on by trying to look at what individual strands are doing.  They lost their integrity.  They're now part of a whole unit that is moving collectively together.  That's emergent phenomena.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So if you just added up the properties of the individual rubber strands, you would never know what was going on there in a car tire.  And physicists knew this was happening in wide ranges of systems.  So this emphasis on collective phenomena, I knew was going on.  I mean you had to be sort of brain dead not to know that this was going on and this revolution was happening.  And I wanted to learn something about that, and that's not what theoretical chemists are interested in.  They're interested in single-molecule physics.  I was interested in many things, constituents together 'cause when you have many things acting in concert, you can get fundamentally new properties.  So how you go from the single to the many was the thing that I have, has consumed me since I left graduate school.
Story_ID: 27646
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so did you publish when you were in--as a post-doc about these--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I published a few papers.  I was not focused on one particular problem.  I think I published four papers.  I think they range from surface tension to, you know, more traditional, statistical mechanics, to the thing that was my segue into my current field, electrons moving around in a disordered environment.  And so the last paper I wrote at [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California] was the one that really was the harbinger of things to come later, I would say.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was that last paper?
Speaker 2: It was on the very simple problem of what happens when you let an electron move around in a bunch billiard balls and the billiard balls are randomly distributed?  So this is a model for, you know, if you have a semiconductor, and you need to add some sort of thing to lose the semiconducting property, and these are put in randomly, it's a model for that.  So that's how I started working on this general problem of localization with--
Speaker 1: Okay, now was there anyone at U-C Berkeley who you were able to draw on for help with this problem?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was one person, not on this problem.  This was pretty much on my own.  There's one person who I learned quite a bit from, and that was Orlando Alvarez.  He was a, an extremely gifted field theorist.  In fact, he worked with Ken [Kenneth] Wilson as a post-doc, the man who came up with RG, the renormalization group.  And he was at Berkeley.  And he was, he taught a class in this new method, and quite a few of the Berkeley faculty members were taking the class 'cause everyone knew you have to go and learn this stuff, you know.  And so it was brand new, and who better than someone who was post-doc with the man himself.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I learned a lot from him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, okay, so in '84 [1984] when you finished this fellowship, you joined the faculty of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did you join the faculty of MIT as a chemist or a physicist?
Speaker 2: As a chemist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So at the time--there's something I should explain here.  I think even the chemists knew that the intellectual content of the physical sciences is really governed by physics.  That was a time when Wilson made this big discovery which changed how we thought about, you know, collective phenomena in general.  There were other systems, there were other phenomena that were discovered, quasi crystals, crystals which have five-fold symmetry, the Quantum Hall affect, and all of this stuff was just coming out of solid-state physics.  And there was a feeling that, you know, it would be a good idea if theoretical chemists had some expertise in this new, in these, in these sorts of problems.  And I was, I was at ground zero of all of that.  So there were several of us who were post-docs at the time who were really trying to make inroads into this area of physics.  And so there were three of us, and we all got hired at major universities.  And then I got the MIT job.
Speaker 1: Who were the other two?
Speaker 2: Devarajan Thirumalai and who went to Maryland [State University, College Park, Maryland], and then Jim [James] Skinner, who went to Columbia [University, New York, New York] and Rob [Robert] Coalson who was less so trying to make inroads in this area.  He was more traditional.  He ended up going to [University of] Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there was a sense that we need some sort of nontraditional element to what people had defined as traditional theoretical chemistry.
Story_ID: 27647
Speaker 1: I have a note here that you started to take a look at Anderson localization?
Speaker 2: Anderson localization, yes.  That was the thing I started at [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California], and I continued that at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So [P.W.] Anderson pointed out something very important in 1958.  What he pointed out is that--so for a long time, before [P.W.] Anderson--let's just back the clock up.  People had wondered, how is that electrons conduct electricity in a crystal?  You look at something like lead, it's a very good conductor.  Mercury, it's a very good conductor, okay, almost all metals conduct electricity.  But metals have a well-defined array of where the atoms are, and then they give up their valence electrons and these valence electrons move along.  But if you have an atom at every site, an electron moving around is going to see that atom and possibly hit it and bounce in some direction and then--this was a big problem in the 19--early 1900s, how is it electrons can conduct electricity when they have to get around an atom at every site?  And some people thought that electrical conduction was impossible.  Well, if you just apply quantum mechanics to this, you see the answer is sort of obvious.  The electrons are waves.  Waves are periodic distortions in some medium.  Since the atoms are periodic, electrons can just change their wavelength to completely oscillate and move through the periodic structure.  And so just applying quantum mechanics showed you that you could explain conduction.  And this was a breakthrough.  What Anderson was trying to address, and people saw that the paradigms had went from thinking conduction in a solid was impossible, for the problem now being trivial.  And then Anderson comes along and says, "okay, what happens if they can't form a perfect wavelength, a perfect wave?"  In other words, what if there's some disorder?  Let's start taking some of the atoms out, and we do so randomly because most systems aren't so periodic.  In fact, the systems he was trying to understand were not.  So what happens if there's disorder?  Could you change from these perfect waves to something that didn't move from one end of the material to the other.  If an electron is described by such a wave, then it's not going to conduct electricity.  It's going to be stuck in one part of the system.  Well, Anderson showed that, in fact, you can get electrons to be stuck just by putting in randomness.  And this was a revolutionary idea.  And it said, you can go then from a metal to an insulator just by putting in randomness.  So, in one dimension, what became known as the theorem of localization, made very, very clear predictions.  Any amount of randomness would give rise to localization.  I looked at this.  We, I, we had published some things before, but the question that we were, I was interested in is, certainly, you can have systems that don't obey quantum mechanics, that are classical systems in which you can have disorder.  And you can get conduction from one end to the other.  Why should quantum mechanics be so different that it would exclude conduction in, along one dimension if you have randomness?  So I figured there had to be a way around this.  And that led to my first real scientific result.  And this was the absence of localization in certain one-dimensional systems.  And the title of that paper was not an accident.  Anderson's paper was entitled, (laughter) "Absence of Diffusion in Certain Random Systems", and mine was "Absence of Localization".  And so I came up with the general exception to the theorem, and it was very simple.  And it went from being outrageous to almost trivial overnight 'cause a few people didn't think you could ever get around it.  But once, it's so simple, I could just explain it to them and it was like, well, yeah, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Does that, is that a level of explanation you understand or--not really?
Speaker 1: (No audible response).
Speaker 2: I can see you're not asking any questions.  Maybe that's not a good explanation.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually--well, no, I don't understand it.  I'll say--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But this was (unclear) (simultaneous), okay.
Speaker 1: I'm trying, I'm trying.
Speaker 2: You're trying.
Speaker 1: Yes, but--
Speaker 2: Like I said, this is the effect of localization.  You, you know, if you have, if you put a sound wave in something, it's gonna, it's going to be bouncing off any number of things.  Is it possible to arrange the things that are disrupting the sound wave so that the sound wave doesn't get out of a certain place?  Certainly, you can do that with clever engineering.  You can engineer the places where you want to have the buffers, the places that sound is scattering off of, so nothing leaks out.  That's called localization.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what Anderson figured out is that in purity atoms, in any material, could block electrons from moving from one end of the system to the other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that turns out to be incredibly important for the semiconductor industry.
Story_ID: 27648
Speaker 1: From what we understand, in the absence of localization is your major contribution?
Speaker 2: That got me hired here [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So things did not work out for me at MIT [Massachusetts Institutes of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] because what happened is, there wasn't initial interests in, people in chemistry departments were more physics oriented.  But many of the people who were part of this wave of physics euphoria by chemists, ended up pulling back and doing things that are more interesting to chemists.  I did not.  I kept on going 'cause I thought that was where the intellectual action was.  So when it came time for tenure, and the department decided that I was not the person they wanted to promote.
Speaker 1: This is the chemistry department though, right?
Speaker 2: Chemistry department.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, because you're really acting basically as a physicist.
Speaker 2: I was a physicist.  I had become--it wasn't clear to me, but you always have some sort of doubt because, you know, you're a chemist working on physics, and, but the approach I was taking was really a fundamental physics approach.  I mean I was trying to come up with new models that violated Anderson localization.  I mean no one was trying to do that.  I did it.  So that sort of put me in a different count.
Speaker 1: Well, now, you're a talented man.  Apparently, MIT knew this, I mean they would have to know that you're a talented man--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --doing something that was valuable.  Did, was there any cross dialogue between the physics department and the chemistry department?  I--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I spent all my time talking to the physicists.  Look, I'm a fairly, I mean I don't really mince, don't waste my time.  And if I feel as though something has no intellectual content, I'm not gonna put any effort into it.  And I didn't think chemistry really had any intellectual--chemistry, as defined then, had no, any, had any intellectual content.  It was all small molecule stuff which I figured had a certain lifetime, and it did, it died.  Physics is still going strong.  And, in fact, the only areas of physical chemistry now that have any promise for the future is research and materials, which is based on the physics discoveries of the early '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s] and biology.  The traditional stuff is, is completely dead, and I knew that.  I knew that had zero future.  And, you know, I decided I'd work on, I would work on what I thought would go somewhere.  But that would put me firmly into physics.  And that wasn't the direction they wanted to go.
Story_ID: 27649
Speaker 1: You may not have any way of knowing this, but did MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I mean it would seem like they would wanna keep you, you know, on the faculty, and so they would, there'd be some kind of discussion between the chemistry department and the physics department to try to resolve these, this--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I see, okay, that's your question.  Okay, so apparently, there were discussions like that.  They didn't go very far because MIT had a rule at the time that if you're fired by one department, you couldn't be picked up by another.  Since then, there have been cases in which--but my case sort of triggered, you know, some soul searching on my, on many fronts.  And one, one was this issue.  And there were people who were fired by chemistry who ended up being picked up by other departments.  Look, my being fired was a, an indication that there was something really wrong going on.  And the department has fallen apart since then.  It's completely fallen apart.
Speaker 1: This is the chemistry department?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in terms of physical chemistry.  It's completely--look, it used to be like Jerusalem in terms of theoretical chemistry.  Now, it's like Kandahar.  I mean it's, there's just nothing there (laughter), okay.
Speaker 1: Is it because when you go far in the theoretical chemistry, you're really into physics?
Speaker 2: No, it's when you go so far in theoretical chemistry, you're really nowhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that, and as it was defined--well, chemistry is defined by what is chemistry?  Physics is defined simply by "is it interesting?"  And, you know, I mean physics is about, it's about laws.  There aren't laws in chemistry, and if there aren't any laws, it's because there's some underlying physical principle which the physicist already establish.  So the stuff in chemistry, I just did not think was very deep, and I wasn't going to go--I wasn't gonna do it just because it would save my career.  I was just gonna focus on what I thought was intellectually interesting.  And so, I mean when I got fired, I--it was a big disappointment, and there were any number of indications that it was not a rational decision.  And I try not to focus on that, but I got an interview here in the chemistry department--or, in the physics department.
Speaker 1: At the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the best job I could have gotten in chemistry was at the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] where my friend, Rob [Robert] Coalson, was, the other person who had sort of made a change from chemistry to physics, but less so.  And, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, okay, so you, but here at the University of Illinois, they brought you into the chemistry--the physics department, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean which is the number one department in solid state physics in the world.  So it was actually a promotion.  I mean no one had ever done, made that step before, from a chemistry department in theory to a physics department in theory.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1993.
Speaker 2: Nineteen Ninety three [1993].
Speaker 1: All right, so you, here you've got the green light, you know, I guess to--
Speaker 2: I got the green light to go and do physics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's what I'd been looking for.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And it was, it's been absolutely fabulous.  I mean I have done what I wanted to do.  I'm in a department in which what I'm doing is central to the mission of the whole department.  At MIT, I knew what I was doing was completely ancillary to their, what they viewed as the intellectual mission of the department.  So it's allowed me to redefine myself and to see that my research does have use.
Story_ID: 27650
Speaker 1: So what has been the thrust of your research here at the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Okay, the thrust of--what has become the thrust of my research is the physics of strongly interacting systems.  So the kind of thing I was interested in when I was leaving [University of] Washington [Seattle, Washington], these are systems in which the individual constituents have nothing to do with the physics that you ultimately observe.
Speaker 1: Okay, what do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: Or can you give (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I mean I would say rubber is a very good example of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The individual rubber strands have nothing to do with why rubber is hard.  You know, it's the cross links.  It's the interactions between the constituents that produces a completely new state of matter.  So trying to understand how interactions between constituents give rise to new states of matter is my basic, it's my basic thing here.  And there is no bigger problem in physics than the physics of high temperature super conductivity.  And that's the problem that I have sort of defined as the problem I want to solve.  And you asked me earlier about Mottness [a characteristic of a Mott insulator], off line, that's where Mottness comes in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, so super conductivity is the, is electrical transport without any resistance.  So it's perfect conduction.  But it's more than perfect conduction.  There's another effect which is going on which really defines super conductivity, and it's the sense--it is that all magnetic fields--so, normally, a magnetic field, when you expose something to a magnet, the magnetic field penetrates the material.  Superconductors repel all magnetic field lines.  The field goes around the system.  The superconductors are a very strange state.  It's not just about transport.  They have weird magnetic properties.  And it used to be that superconductivity was present only at very, very low temperatures.  Well, there's a revolution in '87 [1987] in which people discovered materials, a new class of materials in which superconductivity was increased by around 100 degrees kelvin which is phenomena--which is phenomenal.  It was at a very low temperature effect.  So I think the highest superconductor temperature right now is 150 degrees kelvin, which is, you know, roughly a hundred degrees below room temperature.  But it's still at temperatures that you can access by incredibly cheap refrigeration.  You just make something 150 degrees kelvin.  You can do that with, by liquefying air.  And you get a perfect--you have something that is a superconductor.  The problem with these materials is that these are just metals.  See, if one were trying to make a very good superconductor which has, you know, one of its properties.  It's an extremely good conductor, most people would take something--they'd try to find something that's an incredibly good conductor and then cool it down.  It turns out, you're supposed to do just the opposite.  You find something that doesn't conduct at all, and the thing that makes it not conduct was something discovered by Neville Mott.
Speaker 1: Okay, I--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So all of these materials are Mott insulators.  They aren't insulators because of disorder the way Anderson had discovered.  They're insulators because the interactions tell the electrons that they can't go and move anywhere.  So it's already a state of matter in which the interactions between the electrons dominate the physics.  So this then puts that thing I've been thinking about for a long time, collective phenomena, interactions between constituents, giving rise to new physics, front and center of this problem.  Now, the terms Mottness refers to the following.  Well, it's very simply.  Mottness was whatever was in Mott's head when he, when he told us why these systems insulate.  Now, the reason why I had to invent this term is that people have begun to doubt that there was really anything in Mott's head (laughter).  And they've attributed the insulating properties of Mott insulators to something completely different.  So Mottness is the following, "If there's anything left over from this new explanation that people want to attribute the insulating behavior to, if there's anything left over, then that explanation is clearly incomplete.  Whatever is left over was what was in Mott's head.  And that is Mottness.  And what I've been trying to do is quantify that 'cause that is the essence to the problem.  That is the, that is the essential part of the problem.  Some you can explain away and say, yeah, Mott maybe did not focus on, on all of it.  But if there's something left over that you can't account for with this simple explanation, and there is phenomena, I mean there are phenomena which arise from it--like the reason why it's a high-temperature superconductor, then you'd better understand what is left over.  And that whole phenomena is, the phenomenology of that is what I call "Mottness".  And so my work since 1998 has been trying to solve this Mott problem.  And to do that, I've had to learn various techniques from string theory, gravity, high-energy physics.  So, I mean there's no way I could have done this in a chemistry department (laughter).
Story_ID: 27651
Speaker 1: And you say, now, does the Mottness research have anything to--I mean does it, is it of special interest to the semiconductor?
Speaker 2: No, it's of interest to--so one of the--so I'll tell you exactly what it's of interest to.  Forty percent of your electrical bill goes to the inefficiency, to loss, essentially.  So, if one could eliminate that, so the inefficiency of electrical conduction.  Superconductors are extremely efficient.  They have electrical conduction without any loss.  So a big challenge--but they work at low temperatures, so they may have to have refrigeration.  So a very big push right now by the U.S. government is trying to come up with a room-temperature superconductor.  And this would solve a lot of the energy problems associated right now with the U.S.  And so I am part of a team here that is trying to design room temperature superconductors.  And so we're trying to figure out how we can use the knowledge we have gained about Mott insulators to make the next step to, what would you combine to get a new superconductor?  If we can do that, that would be a huge revolution.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so how far have you come in determining what Mottness, you know, the different--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay, so I think I've come fairly far.  Okay--
Speaker 1: This is a process of elimination--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, okay, so here's the thing--
Speaker 1: --elimination of things that are not Mottness, right?
Speaker 2: Okay, so, I have to say the following.  I hope this isn't taken the wrong way.  I've been working on this problem since 1998.  And I finally reached an answer.  Okay, so it's taken me fifteen years to get to an answer.  And I'm sort of at the end of my Mottness program.  And I will find out.  I have made certain predictions, some of them are outrageous.  And, but they're clear, and if they are right, then Mottness was weirder than anyone ever though.  And if it really is the secret to high-temperature, superconductivity, and we knew it had to be something really weird, that's great.  If it's not, I have to go back to the drawing board.  But the whole program I've been on for the last 15 years has come to an answer.  And what I'm trying to do right now is get experimentalists to address the, to test the predictions of my theory.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when do you think this will all be resolved?
Speaker 2: I think within a year or so, I should know the answer.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're right on the cusp of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right on the cusp, and this is a very interesting time because I--I mean five years ago, I would say, I'm still really trying to get somewhere.  And last summer was a very intense period of focus.  And it led to, you know, the current set of answers that I have.  And--
Story_ID: 27652
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but since the early '90s [1990s], you've been recognized basically as a physicist.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so much so that in 2002, you authored 'Advanced Solid-State Physics?'
Speaker 2: And the second edition came out last year, you know.
Speaker 1: It's a textbook for graduate students.
Speaker 2: It's an advanced textbook for graduate students, yeah--
Speaker 1: And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and I never took a class in solid-state physics 'cause I had a very, you know, shoddy background, right?  But, look, you are what you do your research on, okay.  That really defines you as a scientist.  And there're many scientists who work in areas that they had no training in, no formal training in.  It's just that the problems that come up--look, few of us have the privilege of sort of doing their Ph.D. in something that ends up sustaining them the rest of their (laughter) careers.  Most of us work on the things that are currently defining a field, which typically has nothing to do with (laughter) what you got your Ph.D. in.  So I don't think it's so weird really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm used to being, I'm used to changing research focus, fairly, fairly quickly and often (laughter).
Speaker 1: There're other examples too.  As these sciences are defined, I guess, people at the cutting edge of discovery, you know, blaze--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --trails and ways of--
Speaker 2: --you really have to.  That is, so as I say, I mean what I did learn is how to do research.  I knew that was the most important thing about a Ph.D., not what you did it on, at least to me.  That was the most important thing.  And I could see the difference between learning how to do research and figuring out what an important problem was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so really learning how to do the research allows you to shake off the feathers that are--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 27653
Speaker 1: Now you were a Bliss Faculty Scholar in 2000--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --right?  And that meant that you were supported by--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, my--some of my research was funded by the engineering college.  It allowed me further travel and funds for students, things like that.
Speaker 1: Now, you were saying, you were referring earlier or made sort of a, in a general way, that the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois] has, is one of the top physics programs in the country, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.  And in solid state physics.  It traditionally was number one.  It recently became number two, and it was supplanted by none other than MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], which I don't understand because most people don't understand why.  If MIT is number two, there are several places you might have thought were number One.  The last one would have been MIT.  But MIT has these publicity machinery that guarantees it stays somewhere close to the top.
Speaker 1: Now, there are some Nobel Laureates that came out of University of Illinois, right?
Speaker 2: Right, I mean the reason why Illinois was so strong and has been so strong in solid state is that John Bardeen built up the effort here.  And John Bardeen, I mean the quarters, the engineering quarter is named after him.  He was a semiconductor physicist at Bell Labs.  But to say that is not to give him enough credit.  He, he invented the transistor at Bell, was hired here, won the Nobel Prize for that.  But the real problem he was trying to solve was always in the back of his mind, was superconductivity.  And he solved that problem here.  And the theoretical program was based on his effort.  And so he hired many people, all of whom became top, international stars.  And that's, that defined theoretical solid-state physics for the world.  I mean this place defined that.  And there was no place that was second to this place.  And so from that nucleus, the whole effort sort of telescoped from there.  And they've kept their focus on, the air--they've kept their focus on their strength.  They haven't tried to say, oh, well, now, we're good at this, let's try to--no, they've said, "We are a department that is defined by solid state.  That's what we do.  The other areas will benefit if we keep, you know, our primacy in that field.  See, and, then he won a second Nobel Prize for superconductivity, which is--and his solution was something that had applications in all areas of physics. Cosmology, particle physics, the Higgs mechanism is based on what is the, is intellectual essence of his solution to the superconductivity problem.  So this is, this is a very serious place, you know, and, you really have to do things at a deep level here to get appreciated.  And I like that.  It's very different from MIT.  MIT was--there's a large publicity machinery that, sort of the academic publicity complex, you know (laughter).  There can be substance, but that's not necessarily what, how you become famous at MIT.
Speaker 1: Was there a physicist at MIT that you really looked up to as a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the time, yeah, Patrick Lee.  I talk to him a lot.  He helped me get hired here.
Story_ID: 27654
Speaker 1: Now, you organized and were chair of Pan American Advanced Studies, Institute Workshop on Mottness and Quantum Criticality in Tobago.
Speaker 2: In Tobago, yes, yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) 'Cause you were the organizer, you--
Speaker 2: I was the organizer.  I got funding from the NSF [National Science Foundation] to do this.  And we sold it as a way of increasing the exposure of students in that part of the world to cutting-edge research.  We paid for the, you know, for students to come from certain Latin American countries and Caribbean islands.  And every, of course, every scientist from the U.S. (laughter) who was invited came (laughter) because they all wanted to go to Tobago.  So it was a very nice conference.  It was, you know, yeah.  It was the first scientific conference in Tobago.
Speaker 1: And so that must have been--well, you know, I can--it must have really been exciting for you to bring that to Tobago--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was, it was, it was.  I, I was very--it went very well.  And I would like to do it again.  I think I know how to do it better now.  But it was, it--it was an important thing to do, to come back and give them this conference.
Story_ID: 27655
Speaker 1: Within the next year or so, you're gonna really pin down the Mottness issue, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so, I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, but here at the University of Illinois, like how--I suppose most of your time is spent doing research, right, in--not teaching?
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean I have six graduate students, and they all have individual projects.  So I definitely (laughter)--most of my time is definitely on research.  I mean I teach one class a semester, which takes up quite a bit of time to do that well.  You have to do it well.  You can't just sleepwalk through it.
Story_ID: 27656
Speaker 1: So have you been involved in mentoring efforts here at all with--
Speaker 2: I mean my graduate students, and one of the things I have tried to do is increase the number of students of color in the Ph.D. program.  And I brought several here who probably would not--they were falling, they would not have been admitted had I not gone and sought them and made the argument why I thought they would succeed.  And they've done very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, one of them just got hired at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He was offered a job there.  I don't know if he's going to take it.  So, and he's someone who, you know, I went to the National Society of Black Physicists meeting, and I would just, you know, ask students basic questions, and to see how they were processing, and see if they thought like a physicist.  And this kid impressed me, and so I made the argument that although his background, he'd probably have to take more advanced undergraduate courses, that he would ultimately do well.  And he did well.  And the first person I brought here was Francoise Kidiwingra, and she ended up doing very well.  She worked for the chairman.  And then the next person was Candice Tanner.
Speaker 1: What was the first woman's last name?
Speaker 2: Francoise Kidiwingra, K-I-D-I-W-I-N-G-R-A.  Yeah, she's from the, it starts with a "B".  I forgot which, what country.
Speaker 1: It's an African country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's from an African country.
Speaker 1: Benin?
Speaker 2: I forgot, I don't think I could come up with it right now.
Speaker 1: Burkina Faso?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll stop trying to think, okay.  That's, okay, all right.  So she's at--
Speaker 2: She ended up getting a job in industry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who's the Ph.D. student who's now at MIT?
Speaker 2: He is, he was offered a job at MIT.
Speaker 1: Offered, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, just one second.  I need to figure out his name.  Oh, my goodness (laughter).  I don't believe this.  This is really bad 'cause I just corresponded with him.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  Let's not agonize over it.  We'll just keep on going, but--
Speaker 2: But this is bizarre.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you mentioned another after this one--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's another, there's a student--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Kidiwingar, it was someone else.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Candice Tanner.
Speaker 1: Candice Tanner, okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's at NIH [National Institutes of Health].  She's from, from Trinidad, actually--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but she went to South Carolina State, and also had a deficient background, and I thought she would do well, and I got her admitted, and she did well, finished in four years.  He had a French name because he's from Niger.  Anyway, I forgot his name.  I could look it up on my email, but that's probably--
Speaker 1: That's okay.  Well, this is good.  This is good.
Speaker 2: I'll remember it.
Speaker 1: Right, when it's over (laughter).  But, so, so does--are there any African or African American graduate students here now at MI--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean at University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I've, there's one right now whose name I have forgotten.  Somehow I'm forgetting names right now.  This is the sign of things to come.
Story_ID: 27657
Speaker 1: Did the conference in Tobago like inspire some people--
Speaker 2: It didn't as much as I wanted it to.  I was sort of disappointed by that.  Those efforts, that didn't lead to the kinds of interactions I wanted to foster or, you know, to nucleate.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you plan to do something else in Tobago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd like to, I'd like to, I'd like to.  I think it would be, I sort of know now what to expect, and I think it would sort of be easier to do it, yeah.

Speaker 1: So you're a member of the society of, the National Society of Black Physicists, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're a Bouchet lecturer--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --at Edward A. Bouchet at the American Physical Society--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.
Speaker 1: --named for Edward Bouchet, the--
Speaker 2: The first, he was the first--he was the sixth person in the U.S. to get a Ph.D..  And he's the first African American to get a Ph.D., and he got it in physics at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], couldn't get a job, had to teach high school.  But, you know, the situation in the [United] States would certainly have been very different had he pursued a research career.
Speaker 1: I think he was only the second [sic, sixth] person in the country to get a Ph.D. in physics even though he was--
Speaker 2: You know, that might have been--I don't, you're right.  He, yeah, he--you're absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, yeah, so consider that, right?  It would have been a completely different landscape.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And people don't realize that.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Now, I know that was told to me.  I think Oliver Keith Baker told me that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, 2012, you were made a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is a big, big recognition.  It's a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it shows I've, you know, I've chosen to do things sort of nontraditionally, but it's, it's been working out.
Speaker 1: It's a little like the stamp of approval.  Okay, when you are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --about as real as a scientist can get in this country--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, that's right.  So that, that was good.  That was good.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could do it over again?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--it would have been great had I studied physics earlier (laughter).  I mean high school was just a disaster.  I really was interested in science.  That was really what I wanted to do.  It helped deal with a lot of the irrationality of my childhood, the fact that we were taught to think critically, but then accept creationism (laughter).

Speaker 1: And are you, you still part, part of SDA [Seventh Day Adventist] though?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Definitely.  I'm not religious at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have no, yeah, I guess I'm an atheist.
Speaker 1: Do you--I hear so many, at least African American scientists we interviewed, you know, still say that they are, you know, part of the church, and, you know, or have like strong religious convictions.  Do you have any thoughts about how those things are, how they can mesh?
Speaker 2: Look, it didn't work for me, doesn't mean it can't work for other people.  I really remain judgeless about these things because if someone can make it work for them, that's fine.  I, I, I feel as though religion and science are very different and it comes down to belief.  And if you can believe in the supernatural, fine.  I can't.  And, you know, it--
Speaker 1: So do you think it's possible to be operationally natural and--
Speaker 2: And supernatural (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Supernatural at the same time (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I don't see how I can do it.  But there are many scientists who can, for example, Neville Mott, you know, someone who I admire tremendously.  His work is incredibly deep.  He was religious.  You know, it's not something I can wrap my head around, but I'm not gonna knock anyone's take on that whole thing.  If it works for them, fine.
Story_ID: 27661
Speaker 1: When you look back over your body of work, what today would you consider to be your legacy as a scientist?
Speaker 2: Well, there're two things that I would say rise above the other.  The first thing I did at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], the random dimer model, which is the accepted exception to Anderson Localization and then Mottness, the whole defining feature and the, the sort of mathematical working out of what Mott insulators are, the phenomenology associated with what really was in Mott's head, which Mott could not have known because it required techniques, that went way beyond what were available in his time.  So it would be in the physics of strongly coupled systems and disorder systems, were the ones that I--are the two distinct areas that I've made my most lasting contributions in, I would say.
Speaker 1: And your textbook, I guess written in 2000 [sic, 2002]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 2000, yeah.  That textbook really has become also a way in which I have hoped to define what I think should be taught in, to advanced students and definitely my take on the strongly correlated problem is, is interspersed sometimes surreptitiously but most of the times it's fairly obviously.  I put my hand on what I think that problem is.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's the textbook for this era.
Speaker 2: It's the textbook for this era.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  And, of course, things will change in the future is no more but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean something that wasn't quite clear to me when I wrote it is that the book is entitled, 'Advanced Solid State Physics.'  So a book with that title is already begging to be, to be updated, okay.  So I updated it last year, and I'm sure there'll be updates, and I was not aware of that at the time that this is a book that is destined to (laughter), for, you know, for oblivion, not oblivion, but I mean, just it has a lifetime.  It can't be, you know, 'cause advanced now is not advanced five years from now.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?  And I ask that even though I realize you may not have lived in an African American community since you've been in this country.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: The only time I lived in an African American community was when I was at [University of California at] Berkley [Berkley, California], and I lived in Oakland [California].  And that's as African American as you can get in the U.S.  Oakland is not a, Oakland is, you know, very segregated really.  But there are affluent African American neighborhoods in Oakland.  But I did not live in one of those (laughter).  I lived in the hood (laughter), okay, in Oakland.  I mean it was not a very safe neighborhood.  So, but, you know, I tried to treat it as fairly normal, and I road my bike through it.  It was a rough neighborhood.  So my hope--what do I, I mean I would like to--I still am working to get more African Americans involved in science.  I think that is essential.  Science will become, is, will always be important, and if you aren't part of that conversation, then you're not gonna be, you're denying an opportunity to influence the way things are going.  You're denying that to yourself.  And there have to be people of color in all areas if we're going to change the way color is perceived in the U.S. and for opportunities to be available to the best minds.  So, it's something that I'm not happy about the way things are going, and I'm very concerned about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I can do what I can do.  And, you know, it's something I definitely don't shy away.  I mean I will try to address it, but the way I address it by trying at the undergraduate level and at the graduate level to get students engaged in science and try and go--and pick out people who normally would not be able to get degrees regardless of what their African heritage is, if it's here or abroad 'cause on some level, I don't really make any distinction because, I mean the only blacks who are different, I think, are the ones who are from Africa.  But the ones who were, who have slave ancestry, I don't think are, share the same heritage, whether they were in the Caribbean or here in this country.  So, I don't see any--I mean that's not something most Caribbean's think, but that's something that I certainly think.  In fact, the commonality between African Americans and Caribbean's is much greater than the common, than the similarity with Africans.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that similarity is based on the--
Speaker 2: Just the whole family dynamic and the culture--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the legacy slavery has left over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean Africans were free, okay.  I mean people in the Caribbean were not.  People here were not.  So, (laughter) that's pretty much it.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  You're married, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have a son.
Speaker 1: You have a son that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He's eight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His name is Rusty.  My wife is named Angelique, and she's from Greece.  And she teaches here at the university.  I'm trying to raise my son in a more interactive way or present way, meaning that I'm present (laughter).  It's not based on lecturing and things like that.  It's based much more on the interaction, modeling, perspective taking.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  But I keep working at it.  So a struggle, trying to raise a kid with a sense of himself without him being too carried away with the sense of himself.
Speaker 1: What's he interested in now?
Speaker 2: He's very interested in science.  Since he--he watches lots of things on YouTube that involve science.  But he also has lots of interests in, what is this, Lilo and Stitch which is just this, these aliens that live in Hawaii.  And, do you know this?
Speaker 1: I think I've seen it.
Speaker 2: Or Leroy and Stitch or (laughter).  It's like they're two (laughter).  So that's his current thing.  It's sort of strange because it's, it's fairly frenetic.  And he likes high energy.  He's a very high energy-kid.  Well, he's become a high-energy kid.  I'm not sure it's his natural state.  So.

Speaker 1: I think we all know what we're gonna end up being at some point.  We all know there's a moment where you go, "That's it".  And for me it was when I took general chemistry as a sophomore.  I mean I knew I had math ideas, and, and I knew then I would be a scientist.  Now, it's been a long process.  I mean it's not been straightforward.  But the journey has been quite unexpected.  So my point now is that, that first moment where you think, that's what you're gonna do, I think that's really quite defining.  And there's a lot of white noise that comes in after that, and that should not be a deterrent 'cause we all have something inside of us that's trying to come out, and--
Speaker 2: So you're saying when we feel that passion for what we wanna do, we should do it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, regardless of what your parents say or anyone else.
Story_ID: 27665
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Remembered, as I guess someone who was thoughtful, someone who didn't shy away from the big problems.  By my son, someone who was kind, loving, my family, that's how I'd like to be remembered.  To my scientists, to scientific community, someone who was thoughtful and didn't shy away from the big problems.  I mean there's no chance that my legacy will be anything but that, whether or not I came up with the right answers or not is (unclear) it's something that will be, but still yet to be determined.  But certainly, being daring has, is, is not something I'm short on.
