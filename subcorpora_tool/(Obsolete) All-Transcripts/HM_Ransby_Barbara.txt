Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as a warm up, and they just require a short answer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I know.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite time of the year?

Speaker 2: No. I enjoy the lake, so I enjoy going to Lake Michigan in the summer.
Speaker 1: Okay. And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have to think about that. I don't know if I have a favorite, certainly a lot of Ella Baker's quotes are resonate for me. Give people light and they will find the way, is one.
Story_ID: 635873
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but I'm going to ask about them separately. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Ethel Ransby [Ransby's adoptive mother, Ethel Thomas Ransby]. E-T-H-E-L, R-A-N-S-B-Y.
Speaker 1: And what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Her maiden name was Thomas.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her place of birth is Greenwood, Mississippi. Her date of birth was October 6th, 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family. How far back, first of all, can you trace her side?
Speaker 2: Not very far. There were family stories. I think one of the things about working class families, or families that weren't of means is, you know, people passed on family history through stories. There weren't any heirlooms, there weren't any--you know, there were not a lot of photographs or things like that. So, so I know very little bit about her family history. I grew up with my maternal [adoptive] grandparents and my mother and father [Ransby's adoptive father, Charlie Ransby], so I knew my mother's mother, Rosia Pittman, and was very close to her. They were, the family were sharecroppers in Mississippi, people who worked very hard for very little, and didn't have very much education. I'm the first person in my family not only to go to college, but to finish high school. So, you know, they were poor, poor black folks from Mississippi who worked hard and were honest, and you know, decided to migrate north, and that's their story.
Speaker 1: Okay. Are there any specific stories about what conditions were like down there that they tell about an incident or something that--?
Speaker 2: Well, they lived on someone else's land. They were tenant, you know tenant farmer sharecroppers. And, you know, there were stories about very, very hard work. They cultivated cotton for a while, then they worked--my mother and my grandmother worked as maids for a while. So there were stories about the people that they worked for and how they were often mistreated. You know, I remember a time when I was ten years old. I went to Mississippi with my mother. It must have been 1967, fateful year in many respects, and I was given instructions on how to behave, and that kind of gave me a glimpse into what their lives in the Jim Crow South had been. It was two years [sic.] after Emmett Till's murder, and my parents said, "Look, you know, you have to say yes ma'am and yes sir to the white people down there. Don't veer off of the area where we tell you you can go. You know, be very careful, be careful about what you say." And so I got this sense of enormous repression in their daily lives. At the same time, and I certainly know this as a historian, there was great joy and great sense of community even though people had very little. So, those were the kind of stories, not so specific stories of, of big events, but just stories about daily life.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you had a general sense of how they talked if they really didn't get what they earned and--?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, absolutely. They felt cheated. That word was used, and that was part of what motivated the migration to Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, were there any stories of the family about slavery, about Reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: Not really. My grandmother's father, my grandmother, was one of eleven children. My mother was an only child. And you know, my grandmother talked of her parents having, you know, memories of that era, but not real specific ones, I must say.
Story_ID: 635874
Speaker 1: Now did, did your mother [Ransby's adoptive mother, Ethel Thomas Ransby] get a chance to go to school at all in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother did go to school. My mother went, I think to, she might have gone to ninth grade, but didn't finish high school. My father [Ransby's adoptive father, Charlie Ransby] had less education than she did.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you know what school she attended, or how the school was constituted?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My--one of my vivid memories from my mother, and I really never had any documentation of this, but I put the pieces together later. It is, when she was very young, and I'll tell you how this makes sense in a minute--but when she was very young, she essentially was forcibly sterilized. She, she was a teenager, she had an operation, she didn't realize it was a hysterectomy, and she couldn't have children. So, actually, I was adopted. So that story also gave me a glimpse into black women's lives in the Jim Crow South in my mother's time--you know, just a sense of vulnerability. And certainly now there are many stories that have come out about people being forcibly sterible- sterilized without their consent. So, you know, that was part of what they dealt with, not really fully understanding the implications at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay. Are there any details of that you can tell us in terms of who did it, or who--?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't. My mother realized she couldn't have children.  She didn't tell me the story outright. I pieced it together. I went to a doctor's appointment with her once, and she was telling her medical history, and she told, "You know, I had this operation and I wasn't sure what was going to happen. Afterwards, I was told I couldn't have children. I was very upset." And that was it. It was something that was a source of shame for her, too. So, I think that was part of why other details were not revealed.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, do you have any idea who your biological mother was?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. So they never told you?
Speaker 2: No. Well, they didn't know. They adopted me through an agency in Detroit [Michigan]. And that's not really a big part of my identity. Often when I tell people that, they think, "Oh, that's interesting, tell me more." And I've never had a great desire to search for my biological parents. My parents were my parents, and they were amazing people, and very loving, and that's, you know, who I am.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. There's all kinds of stories, that's why I ask. There are so many different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh I know. And I have friends who--I have one friend who's doing a documentary about children who were adopted--black children in Detroit--other people who've spent lots of time searching for biological parents. It was just not something that motivated me. I felt that that wasn't really about biology, it was about the people who loved me and who I knew and who were part of my life for all those years, and that was, that was certainly enough for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So now, let's see. So, after the ninth grade, your mother basically worked in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 635875
Speaker 1: I'm going to move on to your father's side now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Charlie Ransby: C-H-A-R-L-I-E, R-A-N-S-B-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His place of birth was Georgia--I'm trying to remember--it was rural Georgia. Newnan, Georgia. His date of birth was July 12th, 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both my parents have been, been dead for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, so, well, what can you tell me about your [adoptive] father's side of the family? How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: My fath- both of my parents were born to teenage moms, so they were really raised by extended family. So, my father's mother was a woman named Queenie Fallens, and she lived into her early nineties.
Speaker 1: What was her last name again?
Speaker 2: Fallens.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: F as in Frank, A-L-L-E-N-S. So this was his stepfather's name, the man she married after his father [Lee Ransby]. But he was born when she was a teenager and he was raised part of the time by her and then part of the time by other relatives, one of whom was his Uncle Mitch [ph.], who I heard many stories about, who was a farmer and this great mentor role model for my father in terms of just being a good and very generous and kind man. So, that was, you know, that was my father's vivid memory of him. My grandmother worked for people in Georgia, as a domestic worker much of her life. And I remember when she died, some of the white people she had worked for came to the funeral. I went. My father had already passed on at that point, and there was, you know, this interesting dynamic of, you know she was a part of the family, and you know, it was a little hard for me to take. But it was an interesting glimpse into what her life had been like. After my father's father, she married a barber, John Fallens, who partly raised my father, I guess. And he was kind of the center of their community in East Point, Georgia, which is where they ultimately settled.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now--
Speaker 2: I have, I have to check my own footnotes on all this, too. I have to think about these details and make sure I'm giving you the precise information.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what was your father's schooling like?
Speaker 2: My father went to elementary school, but he did not go to high school. He was literate but he really had not had a high school education, and he always regretted that. I mean, I thought my father was really a very wise person, and in some ways kind of like Ella Baker's organic intellectuals. He was a thinker, he was a serious person that asked questions, but he really never had the skills or training to do as much with that knowledge that he would have otherwise, or wanted to, I think. And he made comments like that. "I regret that, you know, that I didn't have an education." So.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, he basically just, he started working? He was a--was--he was a sharecropper (unclear)?
Speaker 2: My father, I don't think my father worked very much. He worked a little bit on his Uncle Mitch's farm, and then he migrated to Detroit [Michigan] and began working in the factories.
Story_ID: 635876
Speaker 1: Did your parents meet before?
Speaker 2: They met in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Oh, they met in Detroit. Okay, all right. So, is there a story about how your mother [Ransby's adoptive mother, Ethel Thomas Ransby] got to Detroit or what drew her to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother took a kind of circuitous route to Detroit. My mother had been married to someone else before my father [Ransby's adoptive father, Charlie Ransby], and they came briefly to Chicago [Illinois]. And the person she was married to died tragically, and her mother [Rosia Pittman] at that point had moved to Detroit, and so she then came from Chicago to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what about your father?
Speaker 2: My father went to, directly to Detroit directly from Georgia. I think his, he had relatives that had already migrated to Detroit, which is, of course, the pattern, who had promised to get him a job, and you know, he went.
Speaker 1: So did he get a job with one of the auto--?
Speaker 2: He did. He worked in an auto related industry. I'm not sure what his first job was when he arrived, but his job for most of his life was working in a company which was called U.S. Industrial Glove Company. And what they did is they cleaned the industrial gloves that were used in the factories. And so, they were really tethered to the auto industry. If the auto industry slowed down production, if they were using fewer of these industrial gloves, they would lay off people at the plant and this sort of thing. So, that was my father's work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was active in the union. He was, I wouldn't say a leader of the union, but he was active in the union. And I do remember once, and I've told this story. He was offered a promotion to foreman. He had a sort of job that was not quite a foreman in the plant, but it was a supervisory role because he had been there a long time. But he was offered a step up, a kind of promotion, and he turned it down because he really felt a sense of solidarity with the people he worked with, and he didn't want to have the responsibility of firing them. I mean, the sort of friendships were more important. So, I always remembered that story. It was kind of indicative of the kind of person he was.
Speaker 1: Okay. Often they'd only pay you ten cents more to do that kind of work (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right. There might not have been much of a financial incentive either. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, do your parents tell a story of how they met in Detroit? And how they got together?
Speaker 2: Not really. They were sort of quiet, unassuming people. And I regret now--you know they've been dead for a number of years, I regret I didn't push them more. I've done oral histories on other people's lives, and I feel a little bereft that I didn't ask them more questions about, about their lives. So I don't have a specific story of how they met. I knew they met through friends. There was courtship, and ultimately they, they married.
Story_ID: 635877
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' talents and interests and their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's an interesting question. I think in some ways I felt closer to my father [Ransby's adoptive father, Charlie Ransby]. My father was a very strong person, unassuming. I think I'm unassuming. I aspired to be like my father. But my mother [Ransby's adoptive mother, Ethel Thomas Ransby] had a certain kind of strength too that I hope I have drawn upon. My father was more sociable than my mother. My father had lots of friends and there were always people stopping by for favors, to borrow something. Even when he was retired, the kids in the neighborhood [in Detroit, Michigan] would come by to ask favors or have him buy them ice cream, or borrow his lawnmower. So he was really someone who was integral to the communities that he was a part of. And I think that's so important in terms of how we, how we live our lives. So, I aspire to be like him, I think in temperament, perhaps like him. Both of them were pretty even keeled. I think my mother, my mother had a number of illnesses. So there was, I remember, a certain sadness about her in her later years, and I try to, I try to resist succumbing to that.
Story_ID: 635878
Speaker 1: You grew up in Detroit [Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so you were born in Detroit. What side of town were you all?
Speaker 2: West side.
Speaker 1: West side?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I grew up on, well different places. I mean my parents didn't own a home until later, until my father [Ransby's adoptive father, Charlie Ransby] was retired, so they rented. So we lived on Highland Avenue, I remember. We lived on 24th Street on the west side, which is where were we living when the 1967 rebellion occurred. We lived on West Grand Boulevard. And then the final place that my parents lived was a place near Detroit's Cooley High School [Thomas M. Cooley High School], which was on Strathmoor [Street]. All of these places are on the west side. And for most of that time, my maternal [adoptive] grandparents lived with us, Rosia [Rosia Pittman] and Henry Pittman.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, do you have---oh, well, do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I do not.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're the only child (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Only.
Speaker 1: Only child, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, you definitely should have warned me about that. Do I have an earliest childhood memory? I do have an early childhood memory. I have a couple of early childhood memories. And one I'm sure was reinforced by a photograph that my parents kept. And this is another thing. You know I'm in the memory business as a historian, so I always think of how is it that we remember certain things? I remember Easter Sunday that I sat in the kitchen with my mother [Ransby's adoptive mother, Ethel Thomas Ransby], my Aunt May [ph.], and my maternal grandmother, while my mother pressed my hair, which was quite the ordeal. She pressed it and pressed it and curled it because she wanted me to look nice for Easter Sunday. I had a new dress and all this, and it just seemed to take forever and forever. And this was the time when these racist Shirley Temple movies were on, and Shirley Temple had a certain hairstyle, which were these ringlets. So my mother was determined to--it's funny you asked me--I hadn't thought of this in years. My mother wanted to design my hair like Shirley Temple. So we were sitting in the kitchen, and I don't know if you recall the era when black women would sit in the kitchen and put a hot comb on the stove and, you know, really get all of the curls and the kinks out of the hair. So, that was a vivid memory. It just seemed to take forever and ever and ever for this hair grooming to occur. So that's one Easter Sunday. I must have been four years old.
Speaker 1: Okay. That could be dangerous too, right? The hot comb?
Speaker 2: It could be, but they knew what they were doing. It was just time consuming. Yeah, yeah. And it, you know, you smelled the burning hair, so--all of these rituals. But the other memory that I have is we lived in a two flat for a while. And I had gotten a new bicycle, and the little boy upstairs whose name was Pee Wee [ph.] stole my bicycle, and my father went to retrieve it. And ultimately--I don't know--I did get my bicycle back. But I think my father's conversation with me about that was basically telling me, you know, Pee Wee didn't have as much money--we didn't have any money, I thought. But Pee Wee's family didn't have as much money as we did, and Pee Wee probably took my bike because he just really needed to enjoy it for a while. My father gave a positive spin to it. I was furious, of course. But again, he was a very gentle and generous kind of person. So those were two memories.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now when you were adopted, were you a baby?
Speaker 2: I was an infant.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: And they eventually--they didn't really tell me officially this story until I was an adult. These were the days when you could go into the nursery and sort of pick out the baby that you want (laughter). So, they thought they wanted a boy and they came there and they saw me, and I was almost too big for my bassinet, and they decided to (laughter), to save me from my fate so, yeah, so they, they took me home.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it was, they were lovely people and I, I never refer to them as my adoptive parents. They were my parents, so, you know.
Story_ID: 635879
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question: what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: My goodness. Sights and sounds and smells of growing up. Well, there was always food being cooked, and my mother [Ransby's adoptive mother, Ethel Thomas Ransby] and my [maternal adoptive] grandmother [Rosia Pittman] were both good cooks and devoted cooks, so there was always the smell of food, sometimes chitlins, which is a horrible smell. And my father [Ransby's adoptive father, Charlie Ransby] and I would leave the house for that. The sights, I enjoyed--what did I enjoy about growing up in Detroit [Michigan]? You know, it was the era of Motown [Motown Records], there was always music. People had their car windows open in the summer and you would hear music. Kids would go on the street and have dance contests in front of the house. You know, riding our bikes around and feeling a certain amount of freedom in our neighborhood in Detroit at that time. You know, those were fond memories. My parents were a little bit protective, and I was an only child, so I didn't have that experience of growing up in a lively house full of children. I grew up in a very adult space. You know, I was one kid, and four adults. So that was probably different than a typical experience. And we always had pets. I had a dog named Chi Chi [ph.] that I loved, and that was a fond childhood memory. My father had big dogs sometimes, and that was, that was nice too.
Speaker 1: What kind of dog was Chi Chi?
Speaker 2: A poodle, a black poodle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 635880
Speaker 1: Any other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells in Detroit [Michigan]. No, nothing vivid. You know, I remember events. Certainly I remember the '67 [1967] rebellion. There were sights and sounds associated with that that were pretty profound.
Speaker 1: You were ten years old?
Speaker 2: I was ten years old, and I was at a birthday party at my friend Joanie's [ph.] when, when the rebellion exploded. And I remember one of my aunts--and my aunts were my grandmother's sisters--there were two aunts in Detroit--calling my parents and telling them that the riot is coming. And my mother [Ransby's adoptive mother, Ethel Thomas Ransby] and father [Ransby's adoptive father, Charlie Ransby] called this birthday party that I was at without them, and said, you know they were immediately coming to get me because the riot was coming. And it was the first time I'd heard that term. I mean, you know, I had these visions like, "What is a riot, where is it coming from, what does this mean?" So my father picked me up and we drove from my friend's house back to our house, which usually would take a very short amount of time, but we were driving through crowds in the street. They were burning buildings, fire trucks. So it was this sense of the city has exploded, and as a ten year old I really couldn't wrap my head around it. I remember not being terribly afraid, though. I was afraid when I saw tanks and very heavily armed police and the National Guard in the street later in the whole process of the rebellion. But I wasn't afraid of the crowds and the people because they really seemed directed toward property and not toward each other, and not toward us. And there was almost a carnivalesque atmosphere. I mean, people were--there was looting, but people were sort of sharing things in the street, sharing things that they had not been able to afford when order prevailed. And so I wasn't fearful of the crowds, but I was fearful once the crackdown came, and trying to figure out what that meant as a ten year old. So that was, you know, that was a vivid sensorial experience.
Speaker 1: Now was this precipitated by the Algiers hotel [Algiers Motel, Detroit, Michigan] incident? Was this the one?
Speaker 2: This was precipitated by the raiding of a blind pig afterhours establishment in Detroit in '67 [1967], and there had just been constant tensions with the police before that, and it exploded. It exploded into this. So, you know, the other thing in Detroit at that time--there was something called STRESS, Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets. So there had been these sort of police decoy units that essentially entrapped people into robbery situations and then intense brutality was often used, and the community was quite incensed about that. So, a specific incident really occurred in the context of a much larger set of tensions.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, this is--1967 is the era when Detroit was seen by a lot of people as the most prosperous state [sic.], I guess, for black folks. It was--people, other black folks in the Midwest, saw Detroit as New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Living in Dayton [Ohio], when we went to Detroit, it was like we were--
Speaker 2: Big time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, big time.
Speaker 2: Right. I think there were, you know, and as somebody who studied social movements, you always wonder well, why do certain protests and certain events happen at a particular moment? And it's a complicated question. I think there are--it's not always at the lowest point or at the most desperate moment that protests occur. I think there's rising expectations. I think there was a growing consciousness all around fueled by the southern based black freedom movement, but also fueled by increasing disparities at the same time that there was growth and opportunity. There were some people really being left behind. So, I think it was a confluence of things. I think people were also connected to a wider world. Liberation movements in Africa were in the air. The war in Vietnam [Vietnam War] was continuing to take its toll, particularly on, you know in black urban communities who had had soldiers you know who had gone over and come back either maimed or drug addicted or dead. So, all of these things came together to create kind of brewing, brewing anger.
Story_ID: 635881
Speaker 1: Tell me, now why do you use the term rebellion instead of riot?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I think riot suggests a kind of anarchy and a chaos that has no particular direction or purpose. And while I understand that the uprisings in Detroit [Michigan] in 1967 and across this country in that same time period weren't completely structured and ordered, and in some ways they were leaderless, at least what I perceive from my readings and my experiences, there was a direction, and there was a sense of analysis that, that people had about what was keeping them down. There was consistent anger towards the police that correlated to racism and repression that had come from urban police forces, many of them all white, in urban centers. So, that was across the board. And the things people would say, the particular rage about the incidents that had occurred, was very directed. There were--I remember in Detroit, people wrote soul brother on their businesses. And sometimes that guaranteed protection and sometimes it didn't. But there was very directed anger at predatory practices by businesses in the community. These were businesses that were owned by people who lived outside the community, often whites, who would raise prices when people got their checks, who would sell inferior products and not allow people to return them. People would not be treated with respect in those establishments. And so in the context of rebellion unfolding, people articulated these grievances. "Remember what So and So," and sometimes there was an epithet, and then, "remember what So and So did to us?" Or, "Remember how he treated us?" And the anger was fueled by something. It wasn't a mindless rage in every direction. The story I've told my students, which I think is quite telling is also about the complexities of race. In my neighborhood there was a store, Tony's Market [ph.]. Tony lived either above or behind the market. And his kids--Tony was white--I think Italian, I'm not sure. But his children were the only white children that I remembered in my elementary school [Columbian Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan]. So, these were white people who had a business, who lived in the community, whose kids went to the school with us, and you know, socialized with us, danced with us, fought with us, and they were part of the community even though they were seen as typically white. Tony's store was untouched in the rebellion in Detroit. So, to me, and of course when I was ten I had no idea of why that was true, except that it seemed odd. But I thought about it later, and he was seen as, he was given a sort of political pass. He was seen as somebody who wasn't in this category of racist predatory businesses, and therefore was not targeted. So, it suggests to me that there was a much more conscious and deliberate response to the conditions that people faced rather than simply undirected rage. So that's why the term rebellion sounds more appropriate to me than riot.
Speaker 1: Okay. In those days, did anyone refer to the 1943 clash of racists down on the Belle Isle bridge [MacArthur Bridge]? Did people talk about that?
Speaker 2: They didn't. I mean, I know about that through my own readings, but I don't remember talking about it at the time in 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. I just wondered. Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Remember, I was only ten (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah. And you know, you know, people might say well, that, you know, this isn't the first time something like this has happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I'm sure that, that that conversation may have happened among the adults, but I don't remember it.

Speaker 1: Now, what was the information flow like in your family? Did your parents [Ransby's adoptive parents, Ethel Thomas Ransby and Charlie Ransby] subscribe to magazines, newspapers? You know, what was the impact of radio and TV and that sort of thing on you growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we watched a lot of TV. I don't remember listening to the radio a lot. We did get the Michigan Chronicle, and the major Detroit [Michigan] newspaper, which I think at the time was the Detroit Free Press, or The Detroit News.
Speaker 1: The Chronicle was a black paper, right?
Speaker 2: The Chronicle was a black owned newspaper, and actually one of my connections to the Chronicle--when I was a teenager, when I was fourteen, I decided I wanted to be a journalist, but that aspiration since got derailed. But--and I wrote a letter, and this is of course before computers and email and all of this. I typed a letter to Mr. Longworth Quinn, who was then the editor of the Michigan Chronicle. And I said, "My family reads your paper and it's a very good paper, and I'm an aspiring journalist, and one thing that's missing from your paper is a teen column. I think I'm the person to write it for you." (Laughter) And so, I typed up my letter. I was very nervous and I put it in an envelope and I mailed it to Mr. Quinn. And quite a number of weeks later, I got a call. And Mr. Quinn, which--he was very generous, a kind of paternalistic type. He said, "Young lady, you have a lot of confidence." And he says, "I want you to come down for an interview." So I took the bus and I went down and I met with Mr. Quinn--and I think her first name was Marion Peeples [ph.], was his assistant editor. And they interviewed me, and he was very serious and he sort of said, "How do you--you don't have any experience. You're a very young girl, how do you think you can write for a newspaper like the Michigan Chronicle?" And I had all my answers. And anyway, they gave me the job. And the funny story about that was they gave me the job and I would write every week. I wrote about what teens--it was called Teens About Town [ph.]. They had my photograph in there, and I would write about sweet sixteen parties, and I would write about young people who were graduating, and I would write about young people volunteering to do this or that. It was a kind of light column, but I took it very seriously. My mother --and I would have to deliver my columns. I would type them and I would take them physically down there. So my mother said, "You know, you're doing a lot of work, and you're not getting paid for it." I said, "Mom, you know, you just don't understand. This is an opportunity, and I shouldn't be paid. It's just an honor to work for the Michigan Chronicle." My mother said, "I don't know about all that." So she called Miss Peeples, and she said, "You know, Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Ransby] takes this seriously. She spends her allowance on bus fare to come and bring this. You know, I think she should be paid." And Miss Peeples said, "She has been paid. We pay her $7.50 every week for her column." She said "The checks have been sitting down in the personnel office. She never picked them up." So I didn't realize I was being paid, and they never told me. So, you know, I had a bonus. So that was a funny story about--that was indicative of my mother, also. My mother had a sense of don't let people take advantage of you. So--
Speaker 1: When did you start writing the column?
Speaker 2: I was fourteen, so, I don't know--we can do the math what year that was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. And did you write it throughout high school [Rosary High School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I wrote it for a couple of years. I think I wrote it from the time I was fourteen through the time I was sixteen.
Story_ID: 635883
Speaker 1: Well, let me go back. I'm going to go--take you all the way back to kindergarten.
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--yeah, we always do this. And so, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now you, you all moved--
Speaker 2: Let's see how well I travel in time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you all moved around a lot, right? Your family moved around a lot, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, what was your first school that you remember?
Speaker 2: My first school was Columbium- Columbian I think it was called, Columbian Elementary School [Detroit, Michigan]. I went to public school part of the time, and then in about sixth grade I transferred to Catholic school. This was a public school, Columbian Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was the first one.
Speaker 1: So, that was like kindergarten, or first grade?
Speaker 2: Kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So, did you stay there--how long?
Speaker 2: Ah, several years. But when we say we moved around a lot, let me just say, it wasn't an unstable moving around. I mean, it just seems like we rented a place--either my father [Ransby's adoptive father, Charlie Ransby] got a little bit of a raise or the landlord wasn't doing what we thought he should be--and we moved. I didn't feel a sense of being dislocated really.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you didn't--did you have to change schools each time you moved?
Speaker 2: We did, yeah, I guess we did.
Speaker 1: So, it was like about four different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So we lived in about--yeah, four locations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It probably was not even unusual in those days, I guess.
Speaker 2: I don't--yeah--and you know, when you said, "You moved around a lot," that was the first time I ever thought--I never really thought we moved around a lot. It felt like--it felt like the times that we moved it felt like a logical time to move. I think one time was when I was starting junior high [St. Leo High School, Detroit, Michigan]. So, it wasn't that I had to leave my friends or something like--it was a natural break. But, yeah. So, yeah, I went to Columbian Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay, well how did you like school?
Speaker 2: I liked school.
Speaker 1: I wouldn't have guessed (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) In high school [Rosary High School, Detroit, Michigan], I did have a little--I was a little bit distracted for a while. But in elementary school and junior high, I was very, I was a good student. And I remember tensions between the good students and students who didn't aspire to be good students. I remember once--and I remember negotiating this. And it's a lesson that I thought about later. I remember a little boy named Willie [ph.], who was a rowdy tough kid. He said, "You think you're better than us. You're always raising your hand every time the teacher--and after school, I'm going to get you for that." (Laughter) And I remember thinking, whoa, there's a price that comes with this. And then I thought--well, I thought much later about Willie and kind of what that meant. That, if you know something, how you share what you know is as important as knowing that thing. So, the kids were always, "They don't know, but I know, I know." I mean, there are adults like that. You know, "They can't do this, but I can do it." So, is it so important to push one's self forward and to show what you know, or to make sure that that knowledge is shared in a way that people will receive it, and teach you something in the process? So, I think Willie humbled me a little bit. You don't have to raise your hand every time you know something. Maybe there's somebody else that knows it that's not as eager as you or as confident as you. And if you sit back and give them a chance, maybe that's a better thing to do. That was Ella Baker's lesson, too. Willie was a little more forceful in making it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was Willie bluffing, or did he try to beat you up?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't beat me up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, he didn't beat me up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he, he ratcheted me down a notch or two (laughter).
Story_ID: 635884
Speaker 1: Now, what were you interested in specifically? What subject matter or kind of books, or, you know?
Speaker 2: When I was in elementary school [Columbian Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan]? Well, I was interested in all subjects. I liked history a lot. I liked math for a while.  I'm not really, I wasn't really strong in math, I don't think. When I was--I remember maybe either in third or fourth grade, maybe fourth grade, we had a teacher, her name was Miss Bonnie Smith [ph.]. And she was very, very strict and serious. She had thick glasses and she wore orthopedic shoes, and kids made fun of her. And she had test called the forty-nine test. And this was her--it was kind of a rote memory test, when she made you remember geography and your location in the world. It started off, "I live in," and you fill in the blank, "the City of Detroit, the County of Wayne, the State of Michigan, Country of the United States, the North American hemisphere." There was a sort of process there. "These are the oceans, these are the continents." It was a very rigid kind of inflexible way of teaching. But I thought--and everyone had to take the forty-nine test and Miss Bonnie--and you couldn't get an A in her class without taking it--I want to say you couldn't pass fourth grade without taking it. It was a big deal, and kids would fail the forty-nine test and have to take it over again. But I thought about that test as being kind of the centerpiece of the elementary school curriculum, you know, social studies curriculum. And she wanted us to locate ourselves in the world, at a time in which young black children in Detroit [Michigan] might have felt they didn't matter in the world.  You know, everything on television was white and all the pol- you know all of the politicians and people in power seemed to be white.  So, she wanted us to have a sense that as black working class kids, this was our place.  We were a part of a bigger place, and that that mattered, and we needed to know. We needed to locate ourselves as a part of a larger world. That's my interpretation of it, forty, fifty, forty-five years later.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, this is the--so, this test made an impression on you, in terms of where you were in the world (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It did. It did, yeah. I became one of her graders, hence further upsetting Willie [ph.], but (laughter), you know this kid who, who was always maligning the kids who were the teacher's pet, so.
Story_ID: 635885
Speaker 1: So, did you have any favorite books, or, or, I mean, did you go to the library a lot or did you--or?
Speaker 2: I didn't go to the library a lot, I wouldn't say. I mean, I went to the school library [at Columbian Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan]. I was curious. I asked lots of questions in my classes. I read my textbooks. My family didn't have--we had a set of encyclopedia. But my family didn't have lots of books.  Ah, we did have some. My parents [Ransby's adoptive parents, Ethel Thomas Ransby and Charlie Ransby] did value education. They understood it as a kind of passport to a better life, but also a way to understand the world. And so, there was value put on that, and value put on education and homework and so forth. So, that was a part of my growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, did you have favorite TV shows, or?
Speaker 2: Did I have favorite TV shows? I'm sure--I don't know what that would tell you about me except there was a frivolous side, and still is. No, I don't know that I had a favorite TV--I mean, I watched the sitcoms of that era. I remember watching a horrible 'Little Rascals' ['The Little Rascals'] television show, which now I just cringe to think about it. I remember when the show 'Julia' came on about the--this was the black nurse that was played by [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll. That was interesting, you know. Those were my--you asked me a question before. What did you ask me before this? There was some answer I was thinking to share with you. But I don't--it'll come to me.
Speaker 1: About books, library books?
Speaker 2: Library boo- well, one thing I can say in terms of my early politicization--this is later, I must have been sixteen. There was a boy I had a crush on. This is a somewhat embarrassing story, I think now, you know, as a feminist all these years later.  I had a crush on a boy, I liked him very much. And he went off to college. I remember he would write me letters. And he wrote me a letter. He said, "I just read this book, it was amazing." It was 'Manchild in the Promised Land' [Claude Brown] about growing up in Harlem [New York, New York]. And then he said--he wrote me another letter, he said, "You have to read 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' by Alex Haley [Malcolm X and Alex Haley]." And so those two books, I remember those were the first two serious books that I read as a teenager that were not assigned in school that were kind of very eye opening for me. Maybe I was fifteen.
Speaker 1: Those two books were--I know in the college I went to, were used as freshmen orientation--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for students that joined the black student organization.  We had to read 'Manchild,' and 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X.'
Speaker 2: Yeah. This might have been my, this boy's assignment in college. But he shared it me, and because I thought quite a lot of him, I read them. And I might, you know--it was an odd way, but then of course, those books and the ideas that they opened me up to eventually mattered a whole lot more in my life than the teenage, you know (laughter), crush, so.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: I don't remember. I thought about that, I don't actually remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 635886
Speaker 1: Well, how long did you stay at Columbia--
Speaker 2: Columbian Elementary School [Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Columbian.
Speaker 2: I was there several years. I think maybe I was there through fifth grade, and then I--my parents [Ransby's adoptive parents, Ethel Thomas Ransby and Charlie Ransby] put me in a Catholic school called St. Leo's [St. Leo High School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was a black working class school. And there, interesting--they were not Catholic, by the way. The Catholic schools were the affordable private schools for working class folks. It was an overwhelmingly black school. There were a few white students, not very many. And I remember one of my classmates had a brother who was in the Black Panther Party. And the Black Panthers would come, and it wasn't an official--I don't know if it was an official breakfast program in the basement of our school, but they would come there and talk to the children. And that was my first exposure to the Panthers.
Speaker 1: Okay. That seems like, seemed like, you would think they would have some official--because, I mean, you know, you just wonder what school would have a Black Panther just coming in casually, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, the family lived next door to the school, and this classmate had like six or seven brothers and sisters, all who went to the school. So, yeah, I just don't know, I don't know the process by which they gained access. You know, it could be that the priest was close to the family and you know, they were allowed to come in. So--
Speaker 1: So, was this a girls school?
Speaker 2: No. It was girls and boys.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I later went to an all girl high school [Rosary High School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So, you were at St. Leo's. Now when you were twelve, your mother passed away, right?
Speaker 2: Not twelve.
Speaker 1: Twelve, no?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Later.
Speaker 1: Much later?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We have to correct our notes.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah. No, not twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I grew up with, I grew up with both my parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was an adult when my mother died.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, so--all right well I won't worry about it now. I'll just correct it later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, so. Okay, So, how was St. Leo's different from the public school?
Speaker 2: Well, in some ways it was not that different. The demographic was the same. We had to wear uniforms and we had to go to the chapel, which I did not like too much either of those things. I think it was a much--there was a more rigorous academic curriculum. The nuns were strict, I thought certainly at the time, to a fault. But we were--there were expectations and there was a certain discipline and there was punishment for veering from that discipline. So, that's what I remember. I had white and some black teachers at Columbian Elementary School, but I did not have--I think there was one black nun at St. Leo's, Sister Mary Ann [ph.]. But otherwise, there were, there were all white nuns, so that was a difference as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Okay. So, you would have been there for middle school, basically, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It must have been sixth, seventh and eighth grade.
Story_ID: 635887
Speaker 1: Tell us about high school. Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to high school at Rosary High School for girls [Rosary High School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was my first experience in a predominantly white environment.  There were not a lot of black girls there, but those of us who were there were very close.  I took a bus to get there, and later I drove. It was about a half hour from my house, so it was a little bit of a commute. And I became freshman class president. I was the first black freshman class president that Rosary had ever had and that--
Speaker 1: Okay, now what year is this (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) made some parents nervous. I started high school in 1971.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had a large Afro, a la [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis, as I was often told. And I remember the freshman class photo. I had a, we could come without our uniforms, so I had a mini skirt, over the knee boots, a huge Afro, and a fringed vest (laughter) and big earrings. So, these parents of the Rosary--the Rosary girls who were supposed to present themselves a certain way, I think were slightly aghast. "Who is this girl and where did she come from?"  So, anyway. But I remember one memory I have about Rosary, and there are many fond memories, because I had many good friends there, and some of whom I remained in touch with. But we had a school assembly and we the students were allowed to prepare it--to plan it. And I was at that time the freshman class president, so I had a little bit of power. So, we did the national anthem ['The Star Spangled Banner'] and then we did the Black National Anthem ['Lift Every Voice and Sing']. And I remember some of the teachers walked out during the Black National Anthem, and we were so upset that they disrespected--they thought we were being disrespectful by equating it with the national anthem, and we thought they were just being so racist by walking out on us, which they were. But that was, it was an interesting environment. It was an intellectually stimulating environment. There were social challenges, and I really--part of that time I was--I felt a little out of place because I'd not been in that kind of environment before. And I think I didn't do well, didn't do as well in high school as I could have or should have, but I made good friends there, and you know, graduated. I didn't go to college right away. I worked after high school for a while and then came back to college.
Speaker 1: So you had the column going [for the Michigan Chronicle]. This--is this during the period of time that you wrote the column, and?
Speaker 2: Yes, I wrote the column, my early years at Rosary.
Story_ID: 635888
Speaker 1: But it seems like you're being a--you're picking up the, the black movement, you know, I guess through popular culture, if not through home, you know, through just absorbing the popular culture in the days of the black cultural arts movement and other things and--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, at my school [Rosary High School, Detroit, Michigan], you know, we were in the neighborhood, so you just--people were selling The Black Panther Speaks [sic. Muhammad Speaks; Muslim Journal] on the corner. There were poetry readings in church basements. There were things going on in Detroit [Michigan] all over. And you meet people, and you would go to someone's house as a teenager and there were people talking about politics and culture and ideas and reading poetry and burning incense. So, you know, so it was hard to avoid as a teenager, even though I was at a predominantly white school.
Speaker 1: And the neighborhood was?
Speaker 2: I was in a black neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right. So, now did you--I know this was the area, I think. Ed Vaughn's bookstore [Vaughn's, Detroit, Michigan] in the area was popular. Did you go?
Speaker 2: Not very often, but I visited the bookstore.
Speaker 1: I can't think of the name of it. I know it wasn't Ed Vaughn.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know, I know. I can't either. But the other site in Detroit was Shrine of the Black Madonna [Detroit, Michigan]. Albert Cleage, whose views on a number of things I did not share, but the Shrine of the Black Madonna had a gift shop and a bookstore, which was also a place to go for sort of Afrocentric artifacts and books and things like that.
Speaker 1: I saw it later on in the '70s [1970s], but was it--to me it was huge when I saw it.
Speaker 2: The Shrine of the Black Madonna?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the bookstore.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, it was large. And his sister ran it. Cleage's sister ran it. And I remember the first time I went in there--they were very light skinned black people, Cleage and his sister. And I thought, I thought she was white when I first went. And this was the era when this mattered, right? So, I realized this was not the case, but, you know, that was interesting. There's another dynamic about my history, which I don't think about very often, but having been adopted--you know, you and I both grew up in the era where more than now, I think, color within the black community was often a divide. Sometimes it would correlate into a class divide, and--but, I was a lighter skinned black person, but my parents [Ransby's adoptive parents, Ethel Thomas Ransby and Charlie Ransby] and my grandparents were darker skinned. And so I grew up in a family of dark skinned black people. And I sort of--that was my family, and so I felt close to that aesthetic, and I felt sensitive to anti-black comments by other black people. So, it was a kind of interesting juxtaposition how people read me and how I saw my family was a little bit different.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Yeah, so perception, self perception.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're right. People do equate skin color with some kind of status that has nothing to do with what may or may not be the economic status.
Speaker 2: Right. Or politics, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: But there were, I mean, but that was real. I remember when I did go to Rosary [Rosary High School, Detroit, Michigan] and I met more middle--my family was working class--you know, you might say lower middle class or working class, as I told you the educational background. But then I later met black people who had, you know, their grandparents had gone to college, and the family owned land, and you know, there was a certain kind of pedigree. You know, the Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] culture, and that was completely, completely foreign to me. But what I did notice in some of those families, and actually some of the social events I covered for the Michigan Chronicle, it was striking to me that there was sometimes almost a color bar, that no one in the family had married anyone that was dark skinned or brown skinned. That every sister and brother in the family had managed to marry someone as light as them or lighter. So, there was this sort of sense even internally within the black community of a kind of color caste dynamic, so.
Speaker 1: Okay. So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For what it, for what it's worth.
Story_ID: 635889
Speaker 1: So, were your high, your high school columns [in the Michigan Chronicle]--now this can be--like this is a whole--what you talk about is something that--well, I had a similar experience because I didn't know about the Jack and Jill clubs [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], you know, and all of the cotillions and all that other stuff until you know, I got older. But so, you're learning this in high school [Rosary High School, Detroit, Michigan] as you're writing this teen column, you said. You've heard about all this, you know, this black society stuff.
Speaker 2: Right. And being external to it at the same time, you know--a visitor, an interloper.
Speaker 1: Did people assume that you belonged in it? When you asked about it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sometimes they did, yes, because of the school that I went to. I remember times when people would say, "Now who are your parents?" Meaning, is your father Dr. So and So, is your mother, you know, Mrs. So and So, or Professor So and So. I said, "No, my parents are not So and Sos, they're just Ethel [Ransby's adoptive mother, Ethel Thomas Ransby] and Charlie [Ransby's adoptive father, Charlie Ransby]." So, yeah, there was that assumption. I think, you know, if I, and I'm careful to explain the sort of cause or origins of my politics--but if I think there is probably a thing I can locate, it's the dissidence, or the dialectical interaction between my working class experience and my exposure to the upper middle class and elite society that--you know, I saw how hard my parents worked. And, you know, I adored them. They were just people who would give you anything, but they had very little. And then I saw the people who were really getting all the goodies in society. You know, the people who were going on great vacations and parents were driving really nice cars. And then I'd hear from their kids. You know, they often weren't very nice people, and certainly not as hard working. So, I got this sense of inequality and injustice just in looking at the juxtaposition of my parents' lives, to the kind of insider view I could, I could observe from other more privileged families.
Story_ID: 635890
Speaker 1: At Rosary High School [Detroit, Michigan], were there any teachers or mentors that took an in- interest in you, or really anybody in the community that you really looked at as, as a leader or somebody to emulate, or somebody that tried to help you, you know, formulate your ideas and?
Speaker 2: I think there were a number of people. My grandmother [Ransby's maternal adoptive grandmother, Rosia Pittman], I was very close to, and, again, it influences how I see mentoring today, because her mentoring was not formulaic. It was not--she didn't give me any great cliches or things to live by. It's just that she loved me pretty much unconditionally. She lived her life with enormous integrity and allowed me to witness it. And that was a kind of mentoring. I just was always in awe of her strength, how little she had been given and how much she had done with it, and not in a traditional sense. My grandmother actually was a Jehovah's Witness. So, she had, and she told me she had joined the Jehovah's Witnesses, because in bible study they would help her learn to read. I think she had a very basic literacy when she arrived in Detroit [Michigan]. But through the bible study she improved her literacy, so that was a very pragmatic connection to the Jehovah's Witnesses. Ah, so my grandmother was a mentor, would always help me, support me, love me through difficult situations, and kind of gave me the confidence through her example that I could do things that were difficult. I would say other people in high school--I had an English teacher who took great interest--a young English teacher, Scott Norris [ph.], who was one of the lay teachers in our high school. Most of our teachers were nuns, and that was important to me. And we had a teacher who--unfortunately, I can't remember her name. She was a teacher who was, she was also a lay teacher. I think she had been a nun but she had left the church, but then she'd come back as a teacher. And she got fired while we were there, partly because she was pretty outspoken. I remember at the student assembly at the end of the year, students sang the Sly and Family Stone [Sly and the Family Stone] song, 'Stand!.' "Stand, there's a giant about to fall," and it was very inspiring lyrics, and we were all in tears, and I thought, well, you know, this is a pretty admirable person who has engendered such respect from the student body and took a hit for speaking out, but had really won in the end, because the students loved her so much.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: I can't remember her name. I'll remember it, and let you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Was she a white teacher or a black teacher (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a white teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay. And Scott Norris the same?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Because you said there was only one black teacher early on.
Speaker 2: Well, that was actually at St. Leo's [St. Leo High School, Detroit, Michigan]. I'm trying to think. Did we have any black teachers at Rosary? I don't think we did. St. Leo's had Sister Mary Ann [ph.], but there weren't very many. The public school [Columbian Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], Ms. Bonnie Smith [ph.] was, was black, but, but mostly there were not, there were not a lot of, not a lot of black teachers, not any black teachers at Rosary.
Story_ID: 635891
Speaker 1: Did you have good counseling about college or?
Speaker 2: No, I did not (laughter). In fact, I remember, even though this was a fancy school, I remember my, my senior year I was very distracted, just as teenagers will be, and I had not done terribly well. I graduated a year early because the school was closing. So, I think the counselor questioned whether I should go to college, because maybe I wasn't serious enough or prepared enough. And my parents [Ransby's adoptive parents, Ethel Thomas Ransby and Charlie Ransby] were very upset, of course, because they had, you know, spent their pennies to send me to this school. So, I did take a couple of years off and worked because I felt like--the plan was to take one year off because I had graduated early. I did an accelerated program in the summer so that I could have a Rosary [Rosary High School, Detroit, Michigan] diploma, because Rosary was closing in 1974. But--
Speaker 1: So you came out in 1974 then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A year early, not '75 [1975]. It would have been '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I began working for an organization called the Team for Justice [Team for Justice, Inc., Detroit, Michigan]--Team, T-E-A-M, for Justice, which was connected to the Archdiocese of Detroit [Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit], which was doing advocacy work around incarceration and prisons, and counseling people who were just getting out of prison.
Speaker 1: How did you become acquainted with that, and--or recruited?
Speaker 2: We went on a, I think we went on a class trip and we toured the courts and then we visited the offices of the Team for Justice. And I thought at that time I wanted to be a lawyer, and I was very interested in what they were doing. They seemed very idealistic and committed and smart, and I wanted to know more. So I volunteered and then they eventually hired me. I mean, this was a time when there were a number of community based organizations that were funded--this was funded through the church, through the archdiocese, but it was a secular space. I mean, people weren't mostly affiliated with the church, I don't think, but young people who were interested and open and hardworking could get a job like that. I was hired as a coun- as an employment counselor for ex-offenders. That was my first job; that was the title of it. Now, mind you, I had not had a real job myself, and I was a job counselor, but I was pretty determined. I was naive enough to just go knock on doors and ask people, "Will you please hire, you know, this brother, he just got out of prison. Will you please hire him?" And sometimes they did.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, your job entailed interviewing--
Speaker 2: Interviewing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) interviewing ex-offenders?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. We had clients--it was part time initially, so we had clients and they would come to us for help, and I would interview them, and then I would try--I had various contacts, and I would try to get them interviews, be a kind of conduit to getting them interviews with local businesses, community organizations, et cetera. Help them put together a resume, which I'd barely done for myself, but I was cheap labor and I was committed labor (laughter). So, that's how I got hired.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And, where were they located in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: They were located in what's called Greektown, near downtown Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, did you work for them for two years, or?
Speaker 2: I worked for them--I have to remember now. I worked for them for a couple of years, and then--and I met in that period--I met other activists in the city. I remember there were two nuns that worked there, Kathleen Schultz [ph.] was one--these were two white nuns, and they were very much influenced by liberation theology. And they took me to a film screening about Chile. Salvador Allende had been overthrown and so forth, and it really opened my eyes to the policies of the U.S. government in Latin America, and revolutionary movements in other parts of the world. So, that really made me want to know more. So, that was one kind of turning point in my early political education. There was also a lot of activism in the courts in Detroit. George Crockett [George Crockett, Jr.] and a man named Justin Ravitz, and Kenny Cockrel [Kenneth Cockrel, Jr.], who later became a politician in Detroit, had been involved in the League of Revolutionary Workers--Black Workers [League of Revolutionary Black Workers], was a lawyer in Detroit at that time. So, all these people were around the Team for Justice, which was doing, you know, kind of reform work relative to courts and prisons. It was also a few years after Attica had happened, the big prison uprising [at Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York].
Speaker 1: In New York, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, so, the issue of incarceration and prisons was very much in, in the foreground in terms of what was happening in black communities, and that impressed me very much and, and struck me, you know, kind of touched my, my head and my heart very, very deeply. So, that was my first job.
Story_ID: 635892
Speaker 1: And then I worked at a runaway--I worked at a project which was counseling families and young people. It was called Project Headline [Detroit, Michigan]. And then I worked for an organization--
Speaker 2: Project Headline. I guess I'd ask a quick question about how that--
Speaker 1: Name came up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the name--
Speaker 1: I don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and how it relates to what they were doing.
Speaker 1: Well, it was sort of mental health and counseling, was the overall agency. They did drug counseling, they did family counseling, and my little part of it was doing work with young people and their families, as a kind of untrained social worker.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I worked--another job I had--I guess this stretches out more. I was out of school for maybe four, four or five years, and I started taking classes, you know. So, I worked at Team for Justice [Team for Justice, Inc., Detroit, Michigan] for two years. Ah, and then I worked at a project called the North End Community Center--North End Community--I have to get the exact name, NEC4 [North End Concerned Citizens Community Council], NEC4, and it was a runaway shelter for teens in Detroit [Michigan]. So, I did that kind of work, and then I began to take classes and think about what else I wanted to do other than social work.
Speaker 2: So, did, did you take classes at Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan], or?
Speaker 1: I did. I took, I actually took a couple of classes at Wayne County Community College [Wayne County Community College District, Detroit, Michigan], and then I took classes at Wayne State.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I wasn't a full time student. I took a class here and there at those.
Speaker 2: Okay. Were there any particular teachers there that you gravitated towards, or?
Speaker 1: No, but it was also a time when I was getting involved in politics. There were a lot of, you know, organizations, community based organizations, left wing organizations in Detroit at that time, and I would attend meetings and events. So, I was around people who had a, you know, a broader, sort of radical critique of society, anti-racist critique of society at that time. I would say those people had more of an influence on me than the actual teachers in the classroom.
Speaker 2: Now, I have to ask this question. Did you know the Boggs?
Speaker 1: I did meet the Boggs, and I know Grace [Grace Lee Boggs] now. I've gotten to know Grace better since I've been away. But certainly I knew them, I knew them by reputation. I met them--and my--a good friend of mine had been a part of an organization that they at that time were part of, the--it was called NOAR, National Organization for an American Revolution. I was not in that.
Speaker 2: Okay. I think Detroit had a real strong chapter of the Republic of New Afrika. It was--some of the activist lawyers were members.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. I was not. I know about RNA, but I was not involved in RNA.
Speaker 2: Okay this is--okay from, so from 1974 until about what time, would you say--?
Speaker 1: Well, from 1974, I graduated high school [Rosary High School, Detroit, Michigan]. In 1980 I moved to New York [New York], and that's when I really started college full time. So was that--that was a five--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --year period where I worked and did various kinds of political activism and learning.
Story_ID: 635893
Speaker 1: What precipitated the move to New York [New York], and what connections did you have to, you know, make this connection with Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I didn't have any connection to Columbia, really. I, the person I eventually married was moving to New York and so it was a question of, you know, did I want to join him, and I decided that yes I did. I felt like I wanted to leave Detroit [Michigan]. I was curious about New York. I'd only visited there briefly. So I applied to Columbia and I was accepted and given a scholarship, and decided to go.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you weren't married though when you left?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. You got married later. Okay. Now where did you meet your husband?
Speaker 2: I met my husband in Detroit. We were both activists and we were kind of a part of a larger circle. I actually met my father-in-law [Paul Sporn], who was a professor at Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] and, who, you know, who became a friend, actually, and a kind of mentor. He was an English professor and an old, you know, leftist and former trade unionist. So, I had a lot of conversations with him and I got to know him, and we were quite friendly, and I met his son through this network of activists through Detroit that we were part of. And we were friends and eventually got married, and that was thirty years ago.
Speaker 1: Well, can you give us his name?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I can do that (laughter). It's no secret (laughter). Peter Sporn [Peter H. Sporn].
Speaker 1: Okay, Peter. What's the last name?
Speaker 2: S-P-O-R-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. All right, okay. So--
Speaker 2: After thirty years, it's public information (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay, so you started going to school after you got to New York?
Speaker 2: Full time.
Speaker 1: Was that your plan, really to go to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah. And I would say, ah, my plan had been to go to college sooner, but finances weren't right. I was doing various kinds of political organizing and agitating and unsure of, you know--I figured I wanted to change the world but I didn't quite know how. And I increasingly became dissatisfied with social work. It felt kind of like putting bandages on deepening wounds, counseling kids who had no jobs about how to look for jobs that didn't exist for them. So, I really, I was doing a lot of independent reading, and I wanted to do that in a more systematic way. So, I didn't really have a practical career agenda, I feel--I felt I needed a college education, and going back to school was a way to get clearer about ideas that I wanted to understand better.
Story_ID: 635894
Speaker 1: Had you pre-selected Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] as the place you wanted to go to, or was it just, well, I'm going to New York [New York] and I'll figure out which one?
Speaker 2: No, well, Columbia--I, it wasn't a goal to go--for example to an Ivy League school. Columbia had a program, has a college called College of General Studies [sic.], which is for returning students. They have Columbia College, and Barnard College [New York, New York] is affiliated, and then they have the School of General Studies [Columbia University School of General Studies, New York, New York], which is if you were over twenty-one and you were applying for an undergraduate program, that's where you would be directed. And so, so that's where I applied. It seemed to fit for me. They included your life experience, work experience, as a part of the application process. So, that's one of the reasons it felt like a fit. And it was a great fit.  The academics were fine. And I did have some influential professors there, but it was also a community of students that was really important to me, and had an impact on me--very international--lots of--some African students, but lots of Caribbean students, and that was my, probably my closest cohort of friends--were these really, really smart, articulate, tough Jamaican, Trinidadian, Guyanese, bohemian students who were--had Caribbean Students' Association and, you know, it was just like you really had to do your homework to have a debate in that group, and I loved it.
Speaker 1: Who were some of them? (Unclear), it's good to--
Speaker 2: Their names?
Speaker 1: Yeah. It's good to name everybody you mentioned that had a real impact.
Speaker 2: Right. There was a woman named--I do remember their names despite my failing memory. Ayesha Mutope [Ayesha Mutope-Johnson], was A-Y-E-S-H-A, and her last name was M-U-T-O-P-E, who actually became a lawyer. She was from Trinidad, and she was in this group. Claremont Chung [ph.] was another in this group. He was of mixed sort of Afro Asian Jamaican ancestry. Who are some others? Adrienne Lun [ph.] who was from Nassau [Bahamas]. Tony Goff [ph.], who was a black Brit by way of Jamaica, I think. And who else? Well, some other names will come, but this was a kind of core group.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now--
Speaker 2: Michael George [ph.], who was also Trinidadian.
Speaker 1: Okay. There's something about Trinidad, isn't it, that produces a lot of--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah. Well, you know, Trinidad is a special place. I mean, C.L.R. James comes from there, and others. I actually did--my first serious, my first serious research project in publication was on Trinidad and the Black Power movement in Trinidad in the early '70s [1970s], and then eventually--actually when my husband [Peter H. Sporn] and I married we went to Trinidad on our honeymoon, as it were, because I wanted to meet some of the people who I had written and read about. But I had a professor at Columbia who was also from, he was actually from Tobago, the other island to Trinidad, Tobago. And we stayed at his house in Tobago when we went. His name is [HistoryMaker] Hollis Lynch. He was very important to--he's still around, he's retired--a very important mentor.
Speaker 1: He's the author of the biography of Edward Wilmot Blyden ['Edward Wilmot Blyden: Pan-Negro Patriot, 1832 - 1912,' Hollis R. Lynch].
Speaker 2: Very good, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Hollis R. Lynch (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not a lot of people had read that. Yeah. So, I was his research assistant and we became friends. And his daughter now, you know, is a filmmaker. His daughter, Shola Lynch, is--made the film on Shirley Chisholm ['Chisolm '72: Unbought and Unbossed'].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, small world.
Story_ID: 635895
Speaker 1: Yeah I would imagine--now, at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] did you gravitate to the history department? Or?
Speaker 2: I gravitated to the history department. Eric Foner was, and is, in the history department, and became a very important mentor. I kind of talked my way into his, one of his classes on Reconstruction. This was when he was still writing his book ['Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863 - 1877,' Eric Foner]. It was a graduate course, and I said, "Oh, I'm sure I can do it, I'm sure I can do the work." So he allowed me in and he was just very encouraging of my going to graduate school, as was Hollis. They were my two principal mentors as, an undergrad.
Speaker 1: Sounds like two great mentors from what I've read. I have their books at home.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so [HistoryMaker] Hollis Lynch, Eric Foner. Now, there's so much that goes on in New York [New York] that's of interest to anybody studying history. I mean, what other activities were going on when you were there?
Speaker 2: Well, quite a lot. You know, as I said, I was influenced by these Caribbean students who were--became my friends and my political comrades. So, there were activities in, you know, around Caribbean cultures. That was one thing. Hollis would take me to various events at the United Nations [United Nations Headquarters, New York, New York], or with, you know, visiting African diplomats and former liberation leaders. I remember going to hear the president of Grenada.
Speaker 1: Maurice Bishop.
Speaker 2: Maurice Bishop, he spoke at City College [City College of New York, New York, New York], and this was a little bit before he was killed. And that was a powerful, powerful event. So, there were, you know--and I would, I did research at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, so traveled quite a bit up to Harlem [New York, New York]. And there were, you know, there were lots of events in and around Harlem, but all over the city that I took in and kind of inhaled and felt like I was learning from.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, now what was your--so, you majored in history?
Speaker 2: I majored in--well, I majored in history and I--yeah, I majored in politics too, but not as a major. I mean, a lot of my undergraduate career--I was doing antiapartheid activism at Columbia. I was co-chair along with a young man named Danny Armstrong [Daniel Armstrong] of the Coalition for a Free South Africa, which really pushed Columbia to divest its holdings from companies doing business in South Africa. And that was enormously time consuming, and became, you know, really part of my undergraduate career in a really central way. I was constantly reading and learning about the issue because we were arguing the issue, and in building alliances, we met people in the ANC [African National Congress], some of who became lifelong friends. They were part of the Observer Mission to the United Nations and they were young people like us. I remember two very dear friends. I was pregnant--we got married while I was an undergrad, so I was older and I was pregnant with my first son [Jason Ransby-Sporn] right before I graduated college, and at the very height of the antiapartheid struggle. And one of my ANC friends was also pregnant with her first child at the same time, so we were kind of waddling to demonstrations together. And we've remained in touch. Our boys are just a few months apart, they're both twenty-seven now. But that was a very memorable moment of life and politics kind of coming together. But I can't talk about my undergraduate experience without talking about that work, which partly fuels my understanding of how young people learn, and it's not always in the classroom. A lot of learning goes on outside of the classroom if you're serious and curious and searching and passionate about something.
Story_ID: 635896
Speaker 1: So were, were you involved all f- now, you were in, at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] for four years? Was it for four years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, '80 [1980] to '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: Okay. So were you involved all four years?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, all right.  And how big a group did you all have?
Speaker 2: Well, it ebbed and flowed, you know. The 1976 Soweto uprising had happened a few years before, and so what flowed the decade following Soweto was a lot of solidarity work with South Africa all across the country and around the world. And so, we [Coalition for a Free South Africa] were part of that. When South Africa was on the front page, we would have meetings and we would have hundreds of people. When the news coverage died down, we would have ten of us (laughter). So, it varied. But we were focused primarily on divestment, but we also were part of a larger student movement. The American Committee on Africa did some coordinating of that in terms of conferences and things like that. When I think about the Occupy movement [Occupy Wall Street] now--I was telling my daughter [Asha Ransby-Sporn] recently--one of the tactics that antiapartheid students used was we built shanties in solidarity with the shanties in the townships in South Africa, on the campuses. And we had one on Columbia's campus. We had one on Michigan's campus [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] when I was a graduate school there, and there were shanties in shantytowns built on campuses around the country where there were antiapartheid student organizations. You know, again, kind of occupying public space as a way to make an issue visible.
Speaker 1: Okay. And all of this was to push divestment?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's cool. Okay. And eventually you say Columbia did--
Speaker 2: Columbia did divest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Columbia did divest.
Speaker 1: All right. So, all right--
Speaker 2: One of the people I worked with--I guess one other professor I had there, I have to--I just remembered. Amiri Baraka was a visiting professor, so I had a black literature class with him in my senior year. I think I was very, very pregnant at the time, so I was pretty conspicuous. And a good friend of mine who was also an organizer in the antiapartheid struggle was Tanaquil Jones who later married Dhoruba bin Wahad [Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad].  But we were the two activists in, or two of the activists in Baraka's class. Of course, later I worked with Baraka on the Black Radical Congress and other projects, but he was my teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, was Charles Hamilton [Charles V. Hamilton] at Columbia?
Speaker 2: Charles Hamilton was there while I was there. I did not take any classes with him. And he was kind of lowkey at the time. I've seen him since, and we've, you know, we were in one another's presence when I was at Columbia, but we really didn't work together, and I didn't take any classes.  He was in political science.
Speaker 1: Right, right. Now, in the history department--I'm--you know, I think it was somebody like--who was the chair of the department then?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: It didn't make any--?
Speaker 2: It did not make any difference to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who else was in the history department at Columbia at the time? I don't, I can't remember. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who taught historiography or historical methods? Do you know who did that?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that either.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, I know they make you write a capstone paper--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to get your B.A. What was your topic?
Speaker 2: That was the Trinidad paper that ultimately got published. And it won an award, now that I think of it. It was something called the Herman AFS Bell Award for Undergraduate History [ph.]. So, that paper won that award.
Speaker 1: About radicalism in Trinidad?
Speaker 2: Ah, it was about the Black Power movement in Trinidad.
Speaker 1: Oh, the Black Power movement, yeah.
Speaker 2: And, you know, the work with, the influence of the Black Power movement here on that movement, but also the internal struggles in Trinidad. The movement was, the organization that I focused on was, I think the acronym was NJAC. I have to remember now. But--
Speaker 1: Oh, the National Joint Action Committee in Trinidad.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Thank you. See--
Speaker 1: Well, Ben Baboo [ph.] was a guest in my home (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Now you know about him.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I do.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So, you know, so I was looking at NJAC and (cough) the relationship to the oil workers' trade union [Oilfields Workers' Trade Union] and the relationship to movements here, so that was, that was the paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And it was, it was eventually published in the Columbia Journal of Ideas.
Story_ID: 635897
Speaker 1: Now with such a strong figure as Eric Foner as a teacher and a mentor, you know, what, what kind of discussions did you all have about the nature of history?
Speaker 2: Wow. Well, you know Eric has become much more prominent since I was his undergraduate student [at Columbia University, New York, New York], but, we had conversations about history as a career and also just about life and about how one makes a life as a political activist. And what struck me was he was successful, he was prominent, he was prolific, but he was also very down to earth. He really demystified--he was one of the people who helped to demystify the academy for me. And that's important, because I've described to you my background, which was--my parents [Ransby's adoptive parents, Ethel Thomas Ransby and Charlie Ransby] had no idea--Ivy League, what's the difference? They had no idea of a prestigious elite school versus another kind of school that was--it was like going to a foreign country. And there is a culture within universities and within the academy that was really, really foreign and alienating to me. And Eric, I think, was one of the people who made it more accessible. He said, "You're smart, you're committed, you can do this. This is--you have something to say, your voice is important." So that's one thing, just about mentoring in our relationship. But about history, I think he gave me a sense that you can be passionate about something and still tell the truth about it, which is about doing rigorous historical scholarship, and always you're going to find things you didn't expect to find, and you're going to find things you didn't want to find, and you tell the truth about it. And then you decide what you think about it later, and there's no contradiction. You know, I can say, there was this really important movement. Inside that movement people did some amazing things, and some despicable things, and what does that tell us, right? It's not about being--simply being cheerleaders for the underdog or painting a romantic picture of black people or Africa or working class people. It's about telling the truth as best you can, and then stepping back and saying, "Now how do I interpret, analyze, and what do I feel about that truth?" And I think I've carried that with me, because there is this idea of the dispassionate scholar, the objective scholar who doesn't care or feel about what he or she researches, and I reject that. I think we, for me anyway, and I think for most people, the desire to tell the truth about things that you feel passionate about is very, very compelling, because it matters, there's something at stake. And I certainly have tried to bring that to my work on Ella Baker and on black women's biography. It's not all perfect. They're not perfect. They're human beings, they're complicated. And so telling all that complexity is part of the job of a historian, but you can also weigh in on that and say what you think it means and what you think it tells us about the world, about justice, about social change, et cetera.
Story_ID: 635898
Speaker 1: What was--is your assessment when you look back at it now, of the status of black women in the academy, in terms of his- history, as being historians?
Speaker 2: Well, there's still very few of us, and, but certainly I've seen progress, and I think there are people who were the pioneers, who really forced a place for black women's history in the academy, and fighting dual battles, of course, making room for black women in women's studies, making room for--in women's history, making room for women in what was often very male centered black history. So, I really appreciate that early work, and I think it was difficult work. Darlene Clark Hine certainly is one of the people who's paved the way. But now there is a community of women doing work on black women's lives and black women's history, most of them black women themselves, black women scholars, but some of them not. And I think even within the field of black women's history, there's been an evolution, like with all the new groups coming into the larger historiography, which is to say, I think, some of the early work was just to document and in some cases celebrate the contributions of black women and African American women in particular. And then as things have evolved and as the field has grown, I think we, we look at the kind of complexity that I was talking about before, and particularly around class issues. A good friend of mine, Premilla Nadasen, has done a book on the welfare rights movement, a book called 'Welfare Warriors' ['Welfare Warriors: The Welfare Rights Movement in the United States,' Premilla Nadasen], where she documents working class, poor and working class, black women who were in the, you know, welfare rights movement, women like Johnnie Tillmon and others. And so often, those names just never come up, and we hear about, you know, larger than life figures, either Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth in the earlier period, or [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height and the people who rose to a certain kind of prominence of Coretta Scott King. But the women who were the grassroots organizers, and particularly in poor communities, sometimes don't get that kind of attention. So, there's now work on domestic workers and you know, other groups of black women, which has made the field, I think, much richer.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, but, in those days there was no organization of black women historians?
Speaker 2: There is now, and I'm a part of it, and not as active as I should be--the national Association of Black Women Historians. But, yeah, in the early days there weren't enough black women historians.
Speaker 1: Now, did the organization, I mean, did the organization like really do a lot to advance the rite of history by black women or shape it, or did it come after the fact sort of?
Speaker 2: Well, I think a little bit of both. I think the organization supported, encouraged and created a network, albeit small initially, of black women historians, and that that gave people the kind of confidence to do more work, to mentor more students. I don't know that the group was ever large enough or had enough resources to, you know, lobby for fellowships or the kind of institutional changes that might have opened up the field more. But I think by creating visibility for the work of black women historians--and they, for example, have book prizes, one of which I won with my Ella Baker book ['Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision,' Barbara Ransby]. But, so, they have book prizes and things like that and special sessions at conferences. So, they do that kind of work, creating space, creating visibility, and I think that's important. A lot of the work has been informal, of women--Darlene Clark Hine, Elsa Barkley Brown, Tera Hunter [Tera W. Hunter], Tiffany Patterson [Tiffany Ruby Patterson], Nell Painter [HistoryMaker Nell Irvin Painter]. These women really created space for other black women historians.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did you, did you start attending the Association for the Study of African American Life and History conferences while you were at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I did attend, I did attend one or two, but I wasn't active in the ASALH.
Speaker 1: Okay. But I think just going to the conference probably opened up a lot of--
Speaker 2: It did, it did. I don't know, I found professional conferences a little--I was going to other conferences, but I found the professional conferences a little alienating early on. I go now because I've been around for a while, so I see, I enjoy seeing younger scholars coming up, and I know enough people that I don't feel so much like an outsider. But I preferred the political conferences, where we really were talking about the issues closest to my, to my heart, and so I spent more time going to those kinds of gatherings.
Story_ID: 635899
Speaker 1: So in those days, I know, I know you went to conferences about South African--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --liberation and--what were some of the conferences that you did go to?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a conference, actually a conference in Chicago [Illinois] before I was here. I was in Ann Arbor [Michigan], and there was a conference of mostly students of color working on the antiapartheid struggles at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and International House. It was just a large, large gathering of activists and, you know, as you know, the antiapartheid movement was never a narrowly defined movement. There were always people within it pushing to say, this is not just about South Africa. This is about colonialism, this is about racism here, this is about injustice and hierarchy in lots of places. So, I was a part of that group that was always pushing to stretch the boundaries of what we were talking about. And that particular conference--and I have to think of what year it was, but that conference at University of Chicago was one that was quite memorable. And then there were lots of small--we hosted conferences at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] when I was there, and at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan]. And at Michigan, the antiapartheid movement, we started a group at Michigan, called the Free South Africa Coordinating Committee. And I was co-chair of it along with a Puerto Rican activist, Hector Delgado [Hector L. Delgado], who was a sociologist and went on to teach sociology. But we were the kind of co-chairs of that. And eventually that evolved into the United Coalition Against Racism at Michigan, because we were linking South Africa to issues of underrepresentation of black and Latino students at Michigan, instances of racism on the campus, and the climate on the campus. And so, the antiapartheid work kind of melded into, or blended into, the anti-racist work on the campus.
Story_ID: 635900
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] for--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --I mean, yeah, for a minute, and get you graduated.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, when you graduated, what were your prospects? Were you, did you--
Speaker 2: So I got, fortunately, I got a fellowship that was--I was considering, we were considering. I was married at the time, and pregnant with my first child [Jason Ransby-Sporn], who was born a few days before graduation, so I actually did not go to my graduation. I was looking for a parking space on the Upper West Side [New York, New York] to bring home this new baby. But I got a fellowship, a Mellon Fellowship, which was a portable--national graduate student fellowship, which was portable, and I could take it to, what, you know, whatever school I got accepted. So, that was helpful, and I decided to take it to Michigan in Ann Arbor [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], partly, my husband [Peter H. Sporn] made a commitment to do medical training there, but we had decided together. Our parents were in Detroit [Michigan]. We wanted to come back to the Midwest, and there were people at Michigan at the time who I--in the history department, who I respected and wanted to work with. So, that was the plan. But right as I was graduating, the antiapartheid struggle and divestment movement at Michigan, I mean at Columbia, really heated up in 1984. We had a, we initially had a vote of the student faculty senate [University Senate] for divestment. Then the trustees intervened, and said, "Wait a minute." (Laughter) "You may think this is a decision making body. It's more of an advisory body, and we don't know that we can really go along with this." So, then we had faculty allies, because the faculty was like, "Well, wait a minute. We thought this was a serious deliberative body," because we'd won the faculty over. So, the trustees intervened, and it was just a very intense period during which, you know, it was my first pregnancy, so it was very intense for me.  And I remember just laying awake many nights thinking what should we do next, how should we handle this, who should we pull in, where should we draw the line, because the university was trying to sort of negotiate, and there were lots of other propositions on the table other than divestment of what, you know, what universities could do. So, they had a vote, and this sort of played out in 1984. And then you may recall, the year after I graduated, all the people I had worked with in the Coalition for a Free South Africa culminated in a takeover of buildings on Columbia's campus in 1985. And it, you know, it made national and international news. The people from the Harlem community [New York, New York], you know, Elombe Brath [ph.], and Sam Anderson and Baraka [Amiri Baraka], who was in New Jersey--but all these folks kind of converged on the campus to support the students. The campus was shut down and it was, you know, it was very dramatic. And ultimately, Columbia was pushed to divest, but it was at a point where other schools were coming to divest as well. But that was an important moment in that struggle. A lot of forces came together and I think it was a memorable moment for a lot of activists who had gone on to do other kinds of work. So, that was my closing chapter at Columbia. Now the interesting thing, you know, people have asked the question, you know, our current president was at Columbia during that time. And so, a number of people have asked--I did not know him then. You know, maybe he was in some demonstration, I had no idea.
Speaker 1: You're talking about Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].
Speaker 2: I am talking about Barack Obama (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes. So, but we did not, we did not really overlap. And this was a struggle that I lived and breathed every day. So, you know, he wasn't in the inner circle of it. But, so, it's interesting that he was there at the time, so.
Speaker 1: Okay. Does it disturb you that he wasn't involved at all?
Speaker 2: No. And like I say, you know, he may have been on the periphery. But, you asked me the question about how many people. I mean, at times we had many hundreds of people in front of the library at Columbia. And at some times it would be like three or four of us, and we'd stand there looking around hoping someone else would show up. So, it wasn't something that was consistent in terms of a large number of people. Once it got some momentum we could count on, a critical core of people--when there were big actions, there were critical cores of people, but, I mean a mass of people. But, in an ongoing way, the majority of students, including the majority of black students, were not, you know, they were doing what people do. They were going to class and (laughter) trying to get out of there. So.
Speaker 1: As an activist though, when you look back on it, I mean, did the activists kind of know who was an activist?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And I know how most activists think. They think everybody ought to be one (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, you want that, you want that. But there, but I also understand there's lots of pressures on how people live their lives and so forth. Everybody doesn't choose to be a full-time activist, which is what some of us were for a number of years. And that was true at the height of the, you know, what we termed the civil rights and black freedom movement. The majority of people were not in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] (laughter). The majority of people were not in the Black Panther Party, even though those organizations influenced thousands and thousands of people, and people supported to varying degrees for shorter you know, and longer periods of time. But in terms of a core of activists, the majority were not.
Story_ID: 635901
Speaker 1: Well, speaking about the Civil Rights Movement--now you were basically a little girl growing up during most of the activities, the intense activities, Freedom Summer and the Montgomery Bus Boycott and all that. In fact, that happened before you were born. And I think Ella Baker arrives in the South the year you were born, '57 [1957] I think it is.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, I mean, so did you begin to read about the Civil Rights Movement during this period, and--
Speaker 2: I did. I read a little bit, and you know, there would be something on the news--my parents [Ransby's adoptive parents, Ethel Thomas Ransby and Charlie Ransby] watched the news a lot. I remember images on the news. I certainly remember, remember when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated and that our house was in an uproar, you know, what would happen, this was so horrible. I mean, that was already '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Yeah. You were eleven in '68 [1968], right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Well, I was, actually when he was assassinated, April 4th, 1968, was a few weeks before my eleventh birthday. So, yeah. So I remember bits and pieces, and I did do reading, and I read the newspaper and I watched the news. But I was too young to be a part of it, really. But again, like I say, you know, there were people in the community who were talking about things, and you'd go to meetings, you'd go to even a social event, and you'd hear as a child, you would overhear people talking about what was going on. So, I remember curiosity. I cannot claim to be a political prodigy, that I was understanding these issues at twelve. I wasn't. But I was curious and like I say, I really felt my parents' values and their kind of commitment to community and to people less fortunate, and all that. It sounds kind of cliche, but those values made me open to politics that had to do with challenging oppression and injustice, but there wasn't a serious, rigorous kind of training of me by my parents, I can't say that.
Story_ID: 635902
Speaker 1: At University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]--now, who was, who was in the history department, and I mean, you said there were some figures that drew you to it.
Speaker 2: Well, when I arrived there Barbara Fields [Barbara J. Fields], who then went on to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], but Barbara Fields, who had written about slavery in Maryland and then went on to write a very important article about understanding race--she was there, and she was very warm and generous to me. Thomas Holt [HistoryMaker Thomas C. Holt] was there, who is now at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]. He's a very prominent historian. And those were my primary mentors. Now later, I worked with Aldon Morris who was a sociologist, who is now at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]. Robin Kelley [Robin D.G. Kelley] came to Michigan while I was still a graduate student there, even though he was younger than me. He became a part of my dissertation committee. Michael Dawson, who is also at University of Chicago, and a political scientist, was on my dissertation committee. So, that was kind of my core of mentors. Interestingly, all men. And I, because there weren't a lot of senior women historians--and I've written an article about this in a collection of essays, about the importance of male mentors who treated me with respect and confidence in my capacity to be a serious scholar and intellectual, and also who respected my politics. That was very important and very powerful.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Well, all men except for Barbara Fields?
Speaker 2: Well, Barbara Fields was actually never on my dissertation--she welcomed me when I came to Michigan and then she left soon after. So, she was, yeah, she was a role model. But she was not on my, my committee is what I was referring to, was all male (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right. So, well, what did you do your--now did you do your master's [degree] and your dissertation at the same time, or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I didn't do a master's thesis.
Story_ID: 635903
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My dissertation was on Ella Baker.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now, how did you choose Ella Baker? So many people don't know who Ella Baker is today, even after the book ['Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision,' Barbara Ransby] (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Even after the book (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) the book. But you know.
Speaker 2: No, I know. Well, Ella Baker was a difficult subject because, I said she worked against me, because she really spent her whole life doing amazing things and downplaying it, and not really leaving a trail of crumbs for a historian to follow. And that was, that was, there was a point to that. She felt that the group was more important than the individual, that what she accomplished was more important than the credit that she accrued for that accomplishment. So, that made my work difficult. I learned about Ella Baker through the film, 'Fundi' ['Fundi: The Story of Ella Baker'] that Joanne Grant did, and through Aldon Morris who had written the book, 'Origins of the Civil Rights Movement' ['The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement']. And those were my two entrees to Ella Baker. And at that time I was very involved in organizing on campus, and at that point I think we were organizing around the number of, you know, trying to increase the number of black and Latino students allowed on campus, you know, admitted to Michigan, which ultimately led to them changing their admissions policies and so forth. But, but I was looking for ways to think about leadership differently. I'd never been comfortable with this single charismatic leader model, the great messiah model. I think there are all kinds of problems with that, not to mention people get killed, people sell out, people do all kinds of things as individuals. That's when individuals are imperfect, right? So, having group accountability, having collective leadership, having multiple leaders always just instinctively made sense to me. But I didn't see a lot of models and frames for understanding that style of leadership. And when I discovered Ella Baker I discovered that, and I discovered that with depth and meaning and you know, integrity. And so, I wanted to know more about her and there wasn't anything written. And so eventually I decided to do my dissertation on her life--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and politics.
Speaker 1: Now, Joanne Grant is the same Joanne Grant that wrote the book about black women in history back in the early '70s [1970s] or late--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was a doc--
Speaker 1: A documentary history?
Speaker 2: A documentary history (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: And she had been a reporter for The Guardian newspaper and had gone south and then got involved in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and became close to Miss Baker. And she also wrote a book about Ella Baker ['Ella Baker: Freedom Bound,' Joanne Grant].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Much more of a personal, you know, based on her closeness to Ella Baker.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, 'Fundi' came out in I guess, what eighty--what is the--?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the year.
Speaker 1: Earlier than when you got to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], we know that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: So did Ella Baker--it says here, I didn't know, but she died in 1986, right?
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: So, did you ever meet her?
Speaker 2: I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't. So I arrived at Michigan in 1984, and of course I did my coursework and I was doing this activism, so I decided on my dissertation topic a few years after I was there. And by the time I was really working it, she had pa- you know, had just passed away.
Speaker 1: Now did you see the movie when you were at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] or at Michigan (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think I saw the movie at Michigan.
Story_ID: 635904
Speaker 1: Well describe, I guess, what it was like trying to research El- Ella Baker.
Speaker 2: Well, it was energizing and exciting and difficult and frustrating, sometimes all at the same time. I did this first round of work on my dissertation, and then I did a whole other round of work on the book ['Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision,' Barbara Ransby]. I interviewed a number of people and--Ella Baker has papers. I did look at Ella Baker's papers. They're now at the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York]. But I really also patched together an archive of Ella Baker material through all the different people she knew and organizations she was involved in. I spent a lot of time in the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] in the NAACP papers [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]. She worked for the NAACP for a number of years. I looked at the papers of other individuals that she had had contact with, newspaper clippings. There was a lot of material at the Schomburg, bits and pieces in different collections. She had worked with George Schuyler on the Young Negroes Cooperative League in the 1930s, so I found information on that. And so it really was a kind of quilting process, of patching together all of these fragments of Ella Baker's life. I looked at census material, I traveled to Littleton, North Carolina where she grew up, and interviewed people there and went to the public library there, and the county courthouse and so forth. So, you know, it was a journey to really discover her life, and you know, this work of biography. I've just now finished a second biography on Eslanda Robeson ['Eslanda: The Large and Unconventional Life of Mrs. Paul Robeson,' Barbara Ransby], Paul Robeson's wife. But the work of biography--you ask questions of other people's lives. You may not even know those answers about your own life. Like, you've just asked me questions about my own family history. I could probably better answer some of those questions about Ella Baker or Essie Robeson [Eslanda Goode Robeson], than myself. But you are a bit of a voyeur, you kind of wade into very personal areas of someone's life who you didn't know, and wasn't invited to do, necessarily. So it's always a balancing act, of what are you looking for, what do you want to know, what do you need to know, what does an audience and a reader need know to know this person? And then there's the issue of silences. I mean, what kinds of things are just not as important, because you never tell the whole story of a life. You tell a part of a life. And as a biographer, you decide what part gets told, right? Some of that's what, you know, what you find and don't find, but then there are choices. So, it was an interesting, wonderful journey to research Ms. Baker's life. And you know, there was sadness and inspiration, I think, in it.
Story_ID: 635905
Speaker 1: Now, Ella Baker was, was an organizer, and you alluded to the fact that most of her life she tried to stay under the radar--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as an organizer would in a way that only organizers understand what organizers should do. Many people think they know what an organizer is, and don't know. Did you have to do special training, or did you have training as an organizer when you worked in the South African movement?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I felt I was organizer. I definitely was an organizer. I don't know how good I was, but I was an organizer. So I thought about the kinds of questions, I think, that Ella Baker thought about. I think the kind of historical context you're organizing in the moment at which you're organizing, and who you are in that context, all of those things factor in on how you do work as an organizer. All organizers don't stay under the radar, necessarily. You know, there's different styles, and her style certainly was to do that. Others you know, to make themselves quite visible and have people come to them as a way to, you know--you might distinguish that might be more mobilization that organization. But yeah, I think my sensibilities as an organizer certainly shape the kinds of questions I asked about Ella's, Ella Baker's life and maybe the sensitivity that I had to some of her frustrations in her work. She was going to be effective if she could empower other people to do certain kinds of work to function as an organization and as a community. She wanted to be loyal to a larger set of issues and values, and not just an organization. At the same time she needed an organization for its intra-structure in order to do the work she wanted to do. So, all those contradictions, I think factored in. And I think there was also frustration about doing the work, being sometimes invisible, understanding that also being--resentful isn't the word, but being, feeling the injustice of people taking the spotlight when Ella Baker knew that the work was being done by others.
Speaker 1: Okay. I know that she--people that were members of the Harlem History Club years ago, people like John Jackson [John G. Jackson] and John Henrik Clarke, referred to her coming to their meetings, you know. I don't know if she was a member, but she would come to their meetings.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she knew John. I interviewed John Henrik Clarke about Ella Baker and she, you know, there was this whole cohort of people and a number of clubs, actually, and forums around the public library and the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] that she was very much a part of. And she participated in some of the gatherings on the street corner where people would do the soapbox debates. So she was very much a part of the political and intellectual fray, and I call it a fray deliberately, in Harlem [New York, New York] in that period. And John Henrik Clarke was one of the people who spoke very eloquently about her role in that.
Story_ID: 635906
Speaker 1: Now what--her--when she decides to go down to help Southern Christian Leadership Conference, there's a sort, it sort of becomes clear that what she wants to do was very different from the style of leadership that's taken place there. Can you kind of talk about that for a second (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. She had decided during the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], during her NAACP work, that she wanted to do grassroots organizing. She wanted to create ways for ordinary people at the local level to be able to control a campaign, give leadership and direction, and not simply be directed by people in the national office. She saw that as a real weakness, and disempowering and so forth. So when she went south after the Montgomery Bus Boycott to be the first real staff person for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, she was in tension with some of the ministers, who had a very top down view of leadership, and to a certain degree with King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], even though she respected King, the way in which King was being held up as this political prophet--Ella Baker didn't believe in that style of leadership and resisted it. So there were tensions. But you know, there were tensions--she was not uncomfortable with the fact that there were tensions. She knew that there would be that. So, I think she fought inside SCLC as much as she could, and in the ways that she could. Um, she sought alliances with people like Fred Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth], for example, in Alabama, who recently passed away because she saw him as kind of a--even though he was a minister also, more militant grassroots connected minister. So she forged alliances within that SCLC network. But when she saw the sit-in movement take off in February 1960, I think she really, she was on her way anyway. But she really saw her calling and a new opportunity to give some of the lessons that she'd learned, and to also find in these young people--a different generation, different, many of them different backgrounds than hers, but very much kindred spirits.
Speaker 1: Okay. Would you say that she's the founder of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would say that she was the intellectual mentor and guide and anchor for SNCC. But she wouldn't have said she was the founder. I mean, without the sit-in movement, without, you know, Diane Nash, James Lawson and others, the movement would not have evolved as it did. But Ella Baker gave a kind of history and direction and insight and support that was absolutely indispensable. I think all the SNCC people would say that.
Story_ID: 635907
Speaker 1: Well, I guess, maybe, how would you summarize the contributions of Ella Baker?
Speaker 2: How would I summarize--she's a very difficult person to sum up. I think Ella Baker represents a tradition, a black radical tradition, but it's bigger than that. And it redefines radical in a certain sense. Her view of leadership was one of grassroots organizing in a systemic way, building consensus and collective engagement with issues and with communities over a long period of time. She believed in focusing on the most oppressed sectors of the community, so if there's elitism or stratification within a community or within, say the black community, within labor organization, whatever, she felt it was really important to look at the folks on the bottom. She had a story about the town drunk, for example, that people would sometimes come in and organize, and they weren't the most respectable people in the community to come forward and show the powers that be that black people deserve citizenship. And she said, "We're not organizing around the rights of the guy that gets thrown in jail every Friday night because he drinks too much. He's not a respectable, upstanding citizen, but he has as much a claim on citizenship rights as anyone else. If we're not organizing around that guy also, then we're not doing our job." And so that was a kind of social example. But then, there's the economic example. I mean, if we're just organizing around kids who are poised to take advantage of scholarships and get into college and become Ph.D.'s, rather than that whole other track of young black people, for example, and poor Latinos and others who are being tracked into the prison system today, then we're not doing our job. So, to always be very keen and sensitive to the people who are bearing the brunt of oppression, and not, you know, the people who have been less impacted or not as acutely impacted in that particular community or category. I think that's, you know, that's really important. Her style of leadership was one of, again, empowering other people. She was very much an internationalist, that she did not have a narrow view of the black experience or of just its struggles. She was supportive of the Puerto Rican struggles, she opposed the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War]. So, I think a very holistic and humanistic approach to organizing. And the final thing I'd say about Ella Baker, which I have tried to carry with me, is she believed that we have to love the people that we struggle with and struggle for. That it's not just about what we're against, but it's about what we're for, and who we're for, and that so many times people abstract politics beyond human beings. So, it's about these big ideas, it's about changing the world, it's about complex theories--and they can't tell you one person that they really love enough to want to make the world better for. And Ella Baker, I think, in everything she did, reminded us of the very humane and humanitarian impulses that come, you know, with, with the job of an organizer.
Story_ID: 635908
Speaker 1: How did you feel, actually, after writing a book ['Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision,' Barbara Ransby] about a person like Ella Baker? I mean, about Ella Baker.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Tired. You know, it was, I was very, it was a very stressful process at the end when I tried to bring it to closure. In the middle it was fun and exciting, because I kept discovering new things and meeting new people and developing different ways to tell her story. At the end it was very stressful, because once I sent in those page proofs, that's Ella Baker's story. Have I done a good job, have I told everything, you know? What will the people in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] say, because a lot of people had a stake in how Ella Baker's story was told, and people loved her dearly, and I didn't want to mess it up. So, there was that pressure. And then there was my own sense of priorities. You know, what did I want to say about her after all these many years of work, and had I done, had I done a good job in doing that? I think when you work on a big project for many years, you get so immersed in it, it is very easy to lose perspective on what other people know or don't know or want to know about your subject. So I didn't want to crowd out the important details with minutiae, but I also didn't want to leave out the salient things would have made her life, you know, sort of real and relevant to readership and to an audience. But I have to say, I've gotten really positive, I've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback about the book. And I think it's not so much me as it is her, that she was such a gift to the movement, and that her story is really a gift to this generation of activists who can relate to her as somebody that's not above them, but you know, maybe like them in some ways, but who just led this very consistent meaningful life of doing such important work. So, I feel, you know, I feel proud of it. It's still not perfect. There are things that probably I should have done differently or better, so I don't think it's perfect. But I think people have responded positively because of her life story more than, you know, my necessary skill as a historian.
Speaker 1: Okay. I know a few years ago, Nell Painter [HistoryMaker Nell Irvin Painter] tackled Sojourner Truth.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And really caught some flak from people for when she kind of exposed a couple myths about Sojourner Truth that really, you know, she could, I mean, people really want to believe the myth, you know. There are so many myths about black historical figures that people, you know, have been taught or accepted. Charles Drew [Charles R. Drew] wasn't taken to the hospital--you know, his daughter [HistoryMaker Charlene Drew Jarvis] says that's not true really. So, did, was there any major criticism of Ella Baker's book that was leveled by anyone?
Speaker 2: Not really. I think people, some people wanted to know more about her personal life. She'd been married for a number of years. There just wasn't a lot of information about her husband [Thomas J. Roberts], and at one point, even though she was legally married, that relationship was not the principal relationship in her life. So, that was something that I wish I could have said more about, and didn't. There was a time when Ella Baker participated on a committee in the 1940s as part of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], kind of a Red baiting anti-Communist committee that sought to push people of Communist affiliations out of the organization. And she later actually told Joanne Grant that she had regretted being a part of that kind of censoring process. And so a couple of the reviews, I think, mentioned that I could have been more critical of Ella Baker for that, in retrospect. But, but the majority of the responses have been very positive, and it's been almost ten years since that book came out.
Speaker 1: Now, I'm so sorry I didn't bring my book so you could sign it (laughter).
Speaker 2: There will be other opportunities.
Story_ID: 635909
Speaker 1: So that's your dissertation. And so you, you finished at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]. What, what else happened there? I mean, is there anything else (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Michigan?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--while you were there.
Speaker 2: Well, a lot happened. Well we, you know, much of the controversy that we've seen in recent decades about Michigan's affirmative action plan, grew out of student protests that I was very involved in, and had to be involved. It was a very exciting time when, as I said, some people who had been involved in the Free South Africa Coordinating Committee helped to form an organization called United Coalition Against Racism, sought an alliance with a mobilization--which was more of a mobilization--an organization called the Black Action, the Black Action Movement III, which succeeded the previous Black Action Movement and mobilizations on Michigan's campus over the decades. And that effort pushed the university to make certain changes to set up what they called an Office of Minority Affairs, to change the admissions policy, to create new faculty positions. I mean, there were a lot of changes. One of the things that we won out of that struggle is the formation of something called the Ella Baker Nelson Mandela Center for Anti-Racist Education [Ann Arbor, Michigan]. And we were given space on campus and some resources, not much, but--and that was a place to bring speakers to campus to do leadership training for students, to have a resource library around student organizing and so forth. So that was important exciting work, and we made links to the Ann Arbor [Michigan] community, because Ann Arbor, as you can imagine, is this huge mammoth institution with a lot of highly educated people. And then there's a, you know, there's a poor black community in Ann Arbor that--public housing and so forth. And those people lived in the shadows of Michigan. And we brought some of them on campus as speakers. The first black mayor of Ann Arbor, Al Wheeler [Albert H. Wheeler], was one of our mentors and supporters, a lovely man. And so we kind of tried to break down some of those barriers. We also had people come from Detroit [Michigan], Marian Kramer, who is the wife of General Baker who was involved in labor organizing in Detroit. She was involved in welfare rights organizing. We brought them to speak. So, we did a lot of that kind of work at Michigan. And some of those people actually are still friends and colleagues today.
Speaker 1: Was Selman T. White [ph.] there as a city manager?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that name.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. I thought I'd ask. Or, a Tom White [ph.]? He went by the name of Tom White.
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I don't remember, but perhaps.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. But, for example, Cathy Cohen [Cathy J. Cohen] who now works with the Black Youth Project as a professor at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] was one of the activists there. Tracye Matthews [Tracye A. Matthews]--there were a number of people who have gone on to do important scholarship and activism who were part of that cohort at Michigan.

Speaker 1: Now you leave University of Michigan in, what year is that, 1988 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I left, I left Ann Arbor [Michigan] in 1991--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I think it was. And then I finished my dissertation while I was living here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but I moved here in 1991, and that was the moment that Clarence Thomas was being nominated for the [U.S.] Supreme Court. And I was involved in another national mobilization called African American Women in Defense of Ourselves, which really tried to add a different voice to the debate around Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. Anita Hill, of course, was the person that accused him of sexual harassment and almost derailed his appointment to the Supreme Court, and she was vilified as someone, you know, who was not trustworthy--she was making this up, she was trying to bring a black man down--and it was a very simplified formula because, of course, Clarence Thomas had, in many ways betrayed the interests of most black people long before Anita Hill's accusations, which I think were quite credible, came to the fore.
Speaker 1: What voices in the black media were putting this case together, that she was dragging down--?
Speaker 2: I don't remember all the names. I do remember Orlando Patterson from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] wrote a piece in The New York Times which was pretty troubling, describing his take on black male/female relations and framing this alleged sexual harassment in that context. And what his position was, was essentially that this was, that what Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of was a kind of flirtation that was common, and that she should have known that this was harmless flirtation, and not kind of outed him. So, you know, I can't even muster the words to express the extent of my disagreement with that, but that was one pretty vile interpretation. But even people like [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, for example, supported Clarence Thomas initially, and said, "Look, he comes from a poor black background and if he's in there, if he's in the Supreme Court, his experience as a black man growing up in the South under adverse circumstances, that has got to kick in at some point. That has to have an effect on his judgment." And certainly with all due respect to Maya Angelou, that has not proven to be the case. So, anyway, African American Women in Defense of Ourselves was a group of black women. We mobilized people to raise quite a lot of money in a short amount of time for a national newspaper ad campaign which was, it put an ad in The New York Times and a number of African American papers. We raised about fifty thousand dollars, which was a lot for us at the time. I realize it's probably not now. And sixteen hundred women signed a statement that basically said we felt that black women's voices were not being heard, that Anita Hill was being distorted, and it really was not about supporting Anita Hill in a sort of narrow sense as it was confronting all the misrepresentations of race and gender in the discussion around Clarence Thomas. And it was also indicting, you know, his conservative views as not being in the interest of black folks or poor folks. So that was a major mobilization, it took a lot of time and energy, and it was, you know, it was a success, a limited success. But we made a statement and there was an attempt to organize the women who had signed that ad into an organization after that. And there were networks that emerged and sustained themselves, but not for, you know, very long.
Story_ID: 635911
Speaker 1: Would you say that what happened to Anita Hill was--kind of tapped a sore spot for the lot of black women that they hadn't really talked about before?
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't say that, actually. I think we had been talking about some of the issues that came out with Anita Hill. I mean, one of the issues was also the way in which race and gender get dichotomized. Sometimes in the press they were saying there are people who support Anita Hill as a woman and there are people who support Clarence Thomas as a man, you know, as a black man, I'm sorry. So there was the idea that there were black issues and then women's issues--and that sort--where does that leave black women? And part of our statement was of course--there's an intersection, as Kimberle Crenshaw [Kimberle Williams Crenshaw] and others have said, there's an intersection between race and gender and class and sexuality, and that we need to understand the relationship of all these things to each other rather than pitting them, you know, against each other, or falsely dividing the categories.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, is the organization [African American Women in Defense of Ourselves] still in existence?
Speaker 2: No, no. And this is another lesson from Ella Baker, because sometimes, you know, you work hard to get an organization, like going around meeting with people, please come to a meeting, I know you're busy, where are we going to meet, when are we going to meet, who's going to lead it, what's the issue we should focus on, how should we word something? It's a lot of work to move groups of people in rhythm with each other, right in an organization. So, it's frustrating when organizations don't survive. But I think the lesson from Ella Baker is that different organizations have their time, and that sometimes, you know, just like we let go of children and children go out into the world and they grow up--that sometimes organizations don't survive forever, and that's fine, and it doesn't mean the work wasn't important, it doesn't mean that the people don't go on to do other things, and it doesn't mean that the organization didn't have an impact. So, so simply surviving is not always the best measure of success for an organization.
Story_ID: 635912
Speaker 1: Now, we skipped something you did in '89 [1989], according to this. When did you work as curator in Boston [Massachusetts] for the Museum of African American History?
Speaker 2: Not in Boston, in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: In Detroit?
Speaker 2: In Detroit.
Speaker 1: Here we have a big mistake here. (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know. I never worked in Boston.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is the Charles Wright Museum [Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. The museum of African American history in Detroit, which is now the Charles Wright Museum. I worked, I curated an exhibition that never got mounted, although it did get completed. It was on the African American press. It was called 'The Press for Freedom' [ph.]. And in that process I collected African American newspapers, and met with people and collected artifacts that helped to document the history of the African American press, which, of course at one point was quite vibrant, and was part of the connective tissue of a lot of social movements that were simply ignored by the mainstream press.
Speaker 1: Okay. But it was never mounted?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: It's probably--they had money to curate it, but they never had money to mount it, and there was a change in leadership at the museum, and it must be, you know, I mean, we even had, we had many photographs. I was a graduate student at the time [at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], so I was commuting from Ann Arbor [Michigan] to Detroit to try to curate this exhibit. It was an interesting time during that museum work. It was sad that it never got mounted, and I'm sure it's somewhere in a storage bin in the new building.
Speaker 1: I know the Charles Wright Museum has had a tough time connecting with the people of Detroit. You know, at--sometimes it's better than other times, but do you have any analysis of why that's true?
Speaker 2: Well, I think a lot of black museums have had hard times. I mean, the pressure to have donors that will support the museum, to have the curatorial staff without resources to hire everybody you need, and so, lots of contradictions.  And I think issues of ownership that some people when the museum in Detroit evolved, because it was originally a very small enterprise, and then got a nice building and had to move to another building. I think some people in the African American community felt a sense of ownership of the museum, some of that in a good way, and some of that in not such a good way--that there was a reluctance to let a professional staff take over and curate exhibits for fear that something would be misrepresented. On the other hand, a museum needs commitment and passionate supporters, but also it does need professional staff to be able to do their work and mount the exhibits in the way that they can best do it. So, I think that sense of tension that this is a community organization versus this is a project that is going to be governed and propelled by a certain, you know, set of skills and principles and research--if that's attention. I mean, when I was there, there were a lot of evening events. I mean, there were organizations that supported--The Links [The Links, Incorporated], and the different organizations that had supported the museum. And they would have fundraisers there and receptions, and things like that. And sometimes that took a lot of time and took a little bit of time away from actually curating what was going to go on the walls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's not a thorough analysis; that was just an impression.
Story_ID: 635913
Speaker 1: Tell us about the Progressive Media Project.
Speaker 2: So, Progressive Media Project, I worked with, and I guess I'm still affiliated--
Speaker 1: This is 1991, right?
Speaker 2: I think so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Celine (unclear) [ph.] may have gotten me involved, but the Progressive Media Project is an organization that gets writers in academia to write on progressive issues for the mainstream media, to do op-ed pieces, opinion and editorial pieces. They get circulated to a wide variety of subscribing newspapers, and the particular part I worked on was called Black Voices. So, I would be asked to write an opinion editorial, an op-ed--well, you know, actually that term op-ed is not opinion editorial, it's opposite the editorial page, which I only recently learned. But I would be asked to write these op-eds that would be circulated on areas that I have some expertise on. The reason I think the project was so great, is that I would never on my own just have the time to write something on the anniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott or the Martin Luther King holiday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day], or current student mobilizations, to write it in languages newspapers would find acceptable, and then to shop it around. So, just the structure of the Progressive Media Project, where I would write something, they would edit it for newspapers, then they would send it around to the newspapers, and you know, some newspapers would pick it up and some wouldn't. If as an individual scholar I had to do that, I just don't have the, I don't have the time or the connections to do that sort of thing. So they made it easy for academics to write for a popular audience, and I think it's a great model.
Story_ID: 635914
Speaker 1: Now in 1992 you took a position as an instructor of history at DePaul [DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I worked at DePaul for several years before I came to the University of Illinois at Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, what were those years like? What happened?
Speaker 2: They were--it was a good place to be. I briefly was the director of the Center for African American Research [Center for Black Diaspora] there, and that was good. It gave me a little bit of administrative experience. DePaul is a Catholic institution, but has this commitment to community service. And there were a number of student protests while I was there, that as an instructor I had to figure out what's my relationship to this, and you know, of course, I supported the students.  They were demanding more classes in subjects that they were interested in, and you know, protesting events that had happened on campus. I actually don't remember all the details of it, but I do remember meeting some pretty interesting and lively students at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Any, any names that come to mind, of students or colleagues that you remember from DePaul?
Speaker 2: Carlos Drazen, who actually recently passed away, was a disability rights activist, African American woman who was wheelchair bound, and she was an advocate for the disabled community and for the African American community at DePaul, and taught me a lot of lessons about the importance of inclusion in social justice struggles, in that we always talked about not being one dimensional, not just black and not just a woman. But she also added that question of disability rights to the mix. And I think that was a very important lesson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was later my graduate student here.
Speaker 1: Okay. It says that in '92 [1992] you worked as a group trainer at the Clergy and Laity Concerned Chicago chapter?
Speaker 2: Yes. We can't go through all these little things on my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That's fine. Yes, I did. That was when I first came to--I've done various kinds of consulting. I'm very busy because I have trouble saying no to things that seem interesting and exciting, so I end up working way too much. But I did, I was asked to be a kind of antiracism trainer for this organization which was part of the Civil Rights Movement, and did several sessions for them. I also did some work for (unclear) school. Yeah, so it's part--it didn't, it wasn't a large part of my time, but--
Story_ID: 635915
Speaker 1: Well, what courses did you teach, and what, what, you know, did you--what courses did you enjoy teaching the most, I guess?
Speaker 2: Throughout my career?
Speaker 1: At DePaul [DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois], I guess and here [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], too. I suppose it's a carryover.
Speaker 2: It's a carryover. So, I've taught overview courses of African American history. And some professors don't like to do the survey courses. I do enjoy the survey courses. You get students, you get freshmen, and incoming students who are just open and curious, and sometimes they just don't know stuff that's become old hat to those of us who've been reading and studying for a while. And so to engage them and to get their impressions of the history that I have studied and researched and is so important to me, is exciting. So, I enjoy teaching the survey courses. I teach a Civil Rights Movement seminar occasionally. I've also taught women's studies courses. I've taught a black feminism class. I've taught a class on black biography. I've taught a class on feminism and social change, and the intro to African American studies, which is an interdisciplinary course.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. What do you think of the students today? Are they as prepared as they need to be, or are they as interested in the right things, or?
Speaker 2: Well, none of us are ever as prepared as we need to be (laughter). I love my students. They frustrate me sometimes, because they're eighteen and nineteen and whatever. But they also energize me, they amaze me sometimes. They, I think there are a core of serious students who are involved in social activism or who are seriously engaged with their intellectual work and scholarship, and other students less so. But even the students who aren't as academically prepared or as rigorous in their reading and study, you know, there's still a way to connect with them, and there's a way for them to learn from me and for me to learn from them. You know I always say my job as a teacher is to teach, and my approach to teaching is not just to lecture, but to engage students and to make them want to know what it is I have to offer. And so if they're disinterested, it's partly my fault, too, because I need to know enough about them to know how to capture their imagination. So, I don't blame them if they're less interesting. I just see it as a challenge, a way that we have to be more creative in our pedagogy. And I wish that we were freer than we are to teach in different ways, because there are very creative ways of teaching and learning that don't have to do with, you know, meeting fifty minutes three times a week in a you know, ten by ten [foot] room, but taking them out into city, engaging them in smaller and larger groups and--you know, I understand in an institution we have to have a certain kind of grid on which the learning goes on. But it is confining.
Story_ID: 635916
Speaker 1: During the early '90s [1990s] Nelson Mandela came to Chicago [Illinois]. Were you part of (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I wasn't here.
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: I hadn't moved here yet, I hadn't moved here yet.
Speaker 1: Did you see him in Detroit [Michigan]? 'Cause he was there too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't. But, no, I, you know, I remember when Nelson Mandela was released in, you know, we had done all this work at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan]. The work at Michigan was actually--Michigan had divested. The state has divested, but we pushed for the university to give Nelson Mandela an honorary degree when he was in prison, in absentia. And the board of regents had a policy of not giving honorary degrees to people who couldn't come and pick them up. And we said, "But he's in prison, you know, for all the reasons we want to honor him." And there was real opposition, because, and I think this is important to remind people with all this talk about terrorism now--I mean the ANC [African National Congress] was deemed a terrorist organization, and Nelson Mandela was described as a terrorist, because he had taken up arms against the South African regime. So, it was controversial then. Now, of course, he had become a beloved head of state, now a beloved elder in the world, you know, human rights community and he's viewed differently. But at the time, it was controversial to ask for him to be given an honorary degree. So that was our push, and we ended up, you know, taking over meetings and things like that in order to push for that. So we were ecstatic when he finally was released from prison. And I remember my son [Jason Ransby-Sporn] was very little. We went out on the central area at Michigan. It's called a Diag, in front of the library. So hundreds of us went out on the Diag that night and we danced the Toyi-toyi, which is in the townships, the sort of dance of joy and protests and solidarity and celebration. So we all danced the Toyi-toyi, including my, at that time, very young son. We thought it was great fun, you know. Like, you all are doing all this political stuff, we should have been dancing all along. So, it was a really joyful time. But I never met Mandela personally. But, interestingly, and this is how protests evolved--so, the university did give us a lot of trouble. And some people supported, but many opposed this. They finally agreed to give him an honorary degree after several years of struggle around this. And then when he was released from prison and about to assume the presidency--maybe he was already the president--they sent a delegation of university administrators to present the honorary degree to him in person and there was, you know, many wonderful photographs, and I got a photograph. But it was kind of ironic because of course, the institution had resisted doing this back when it mattered (laughter). But then of course, you know kind of basked in the--
Speaker 1: Jumped on the bandwagon?
Speaker 2: --in the limelight. Yeah, once he was a hero.
Story_ID: 635917
Speaker 1: You earned your Ph.D. in '96 [1996] and, now tell us about--so you, and you become an assistant professor at University of Illinois at Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] here in 1996, too, is that true (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: All right. Tell us about the founding of the Black Radical Congress in 1998.
Speaker 2: In 1998? The Black Radical Congress was an attempt to bring together intellectuals and activists in the black community, scholar activists, and really it was an attempt to speak to several strains of tradition in organizing and thinking: feminism, nationalism, and sort of left--black left work, including people who were Socialists and Communists and others, and to see what was the common agenda, and for some of the feminists involved, in particular some of whom overlapped with the other categories. The Million Man March had happened in 1995, and some of us were critical of the Million Man March as being exclusive of women, you know, exclusive to men and excluding women, and celebrating a kind of patriarchy that men have to assume their rightful places at the helm of the organizations and the family, when we were saying, no, this should be a partnership issue, the equality. And also it was opposing some of the celebration of capitalism, of basically, you know, it's black owned businesses, it's getting, you know, economic success for individuals, that this is going to propel communities forward as opposed to more collective thinking about economic justice. So there was political opposition around what we felt--even though it was a popular mobilization, many people went who did not subscribe to Farrakhan's [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] view of politics of the world. But we felt like there needed to be, as Bill Fletcher [HistoryMaker William Gerald Fletcher, Jr.] said, another pole. That is, another common vision, even if it wasn't completely united, about what black transformative politics represented. So, it was several years in the planning. I was one of the initiators along with [HistoryMaker] Manning Marable, Bill Fletcher, Abdul Alkalimat and Leith Mullings.  And we sort of spread our, you know, our network and contacted people we had worked with over the years and were in touch with, and brought together a very, very eclectic group of scholars and activists and scholar activists and young people and older people for a couple of days. And there were two thousand people here in Chicago [Illinois] for that event. Before that and after that, there were local committees and local chapters of the Black Radical Congress, and it lasted for a number of years. [HistoryMaker] Jamala Rogers from St. Louis [Missouri] was one of the staff people that kind of held it together very admirably. But again, like many other organizations, it didn't survive, but I think it still was an important, you know, intervention, even just the array of people on the platforms, you know, from Kathleen Cleaver and [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis to Amiri Baraka and Sam Anderson, many young activists who were, you know who were here. I mean it was just quite a gathering.
Story_ID: 635918
Speaker 1: Two thousand [2000] you wrote a forward for a book called 'Deep in Our Hearts: Nine White Women in the Freedom Movement' that was published before the Ella Baker book ['Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision,' Barbara Ransby]. So why did you think that was important enough to write a forward?
Speaker 2: Well I was invited to, you know, I was on a panel with some of those women, and I was invited to do it, and I really, my comments on the panel led to the forward to the book. It wasn't a project that I was deeply involved in. I knew most of those women. There had been some, there was some criticism later of why nine white women as opposed to, you know, women. And then there's a new book, 'Behind Freedom's Plow' [sic. 'Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC'], I think was the title, with Martha Prescod Norman and others, with a broader number of women, from SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and other parts of the movement. But I wrote it because I thought it did say something about the white people who got involved in the civil rights and black freedom movement. And they all understood they were getting involved in a black freedom movement. There were some young white volunteers who were very fly by night, and very temporary in their commitment, but then there was another smaller group of people for whom it, you know, it changed their lives, it humbled them, it gave them a sense of a connection to history and to black peoples' struggles that was very powerful and important. It was a different way of conceiving of politics and their own identity as white people in a larger racist society. So, I thought it was an important story to tell, about how these young women, with all the pressures on them, to basically accept certain aspects of white privilege and racism, would align themselves with a movement that they didn't know would win, and they definitely knew it would cost them something--you know, that that was an important story. It's not the only story, and maybe it's not the most important story, but it was an important story.
Speaker 1: Okay. It's certainly as important as any other, I would guess, in some ways.  But, there was a--well I don't want to get into all that, I'm trying to speed through. But, okay, so the Ella Baker book was published in 2003, and it took that long for it to make a transition from a dissertation to book form?
Speaker 2: It did, it took a long time. I mean, I really, I thickened it, I did more research, I massaged it over and over and over again, from the dissertation to the book. So, it really was a new product when the book was finally published.
Story_ID: 635919
Speaker 1: Now, you're currently the interim vice provost for planning and programs. And it sounds, that sounds just so different from everything else you're doing. How did this come up?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I'm still a professor. I'm still, I'm doing a temporary administrative post and part of the appeal of the position is twofold. There's one--I do feel that the current provost here at UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] is someone committed to inclusion, access and justice issues. So, I felt like it was an administration--and a chancellor. So I feel like it was an administration provost and chancellor that I could work with and for. And one of the initiatives that we're doing is a social justice initiative. And my whole life has been a little bit divided between my activism and my scholarship. They overlap, but sometimes ever so lightly. But I think that for a public university in the middle of Chicago [Illinois], that part of the mission ought to be to teach students how to serve their communities, how to enact greater justice in the world without mandating what that is, without brainwashing anybody or converting anybody or, you know, arm twisting, but to say, to study how to realize greater social justice and democracy is a part of what young thinkers and students and intellectuals ought to be doing. They ought to be arguing with each other about it, they ought to be reading deeply, they ought to be learning from people on campus and off campus. So the social justice initiative is around. I'm trying to create a kind of pipeline for students interested in doing work in non profits and community organizing, et cetera. So, that's very exciting to me--and also creating a cohort among faculty who are doing work around social justice. So, the administrative role is really a part of a larger vision of the mission of an urban public university, and what I'd like to see it do, to serve, you know, the interests of oppressed people, and to serve the greater interest of justice, and justice through, through knowledge and education.
Story_ID: 635920
Speaker 1: Now you're also working on a book about Eslanda Robeson ['Eslanda: The Large and Unconventional Life of Mrs. Paul Robeson,' Barbara Ransby], who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I am done with the book. I've turned it into the publisher. So, yeah, so I spent the last five years or so doing my second biography, which is a book on Eslanda Cardozo Goode Robeson [Eslanda Goode Robeson], who was the wife of Paul Robeson, and who was an anthropologist, activist, journalist, and who really, I mean in some ways just kind of--her story has been in the shadows of her husband's story. He's such a larger than life figure. And I really feel there was a biography of Paul Robeson by Marty Duberman ['Paul Robeson,' Martin Duberman] many years ago. And it really didn't do--it was a very, very comprehensive biography of Robeson in a certain sense, but it didn't do justice to Essie Robeson, and I think offered a kind of distorted view of what she was about. And so, I've enjoyed really researching her life. I mean, she was really an internationalist, and traveled and spent time in China, the Soviet Union, Ghana, South Africa, Trinidad, Trinidad again, and other parts of Europe and Africa. So, she was a very interesting woman who witnessed history, participated in it, and wrote very passionately about it. And so it was a different kind of person to write about than Ella Baker, but it's been an interesting project.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was mentioned earlier this week by one of our interviewees as a chemist.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And she's mentioned in the history of African American women chemists.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yes she was. She was a chemistry major and then she held a job in the laboratory at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital [New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York]. That was her early short career. And then she became Paul Robeson's manager, and then she, you know, went on to London School of Economics [London School of Economics and Political Science, London, England] and other places and got more training and did more research and writing.

Speaker 1: Anybody watching this should know that you have many, many articles that are written and contributions to books and organizations in which you're on the board of, but when, when we, when you look back at all of that, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Ooh, legacy, that makes me sound old. (Laughter) I don't know. I really, I have never thought of a legacy. The one thing I, I'm not proud of it yet because it hasn't happened, but I'm excited about it, is that I've just agreed to take over the editorship of the journal of souls [Souls], which was a journal founded by [HistoryMaker] Manning Marable in 1999. And I worked with Manny off and on over the years on a number of projects and he was someone who really spoke out about economic justice along with racial justice, and who spoke around gender issues and women's issues at an early time when many people weren't talking it. So, I had a lot of respect for him over the years. So, I'm very proud to be taking over the editorship. The journal is going to move from New York [New York] to Chicago [Illinois]. And I really see it as a way to resurrect the spirit of Freedomways journal, which was an early journal that Jack O'Dell [Hunter Pitts "Jack" O'Dell] and others, Esther Cooper Jackson and others, worked on (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) John Henrik Clarke.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the '50s [1950s]. So, that's something I'm excited about. But I think the community of people that I have done both scholarly and most importantly political work with over the years is my greatest--I mean I just feel privileged to have been friends with and in partnership and collaboration with, just some really amazing, decent, selfless people who I've seen do work up close over many, many years. So, that community which changes over time, and is a little more--I mean, we're not all in a single organization or anything like that, but I think that's what I feel most proud of, that I've cultivated that. And that I've been a very good mom while I've been a scholar and an activist, and hopefully a good partner to my husband [Peter H. Sporn].

Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit about your family.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, you know, they're a, they're, they're a good bunch. We have a lot of arguments over dinner (laughter). A couple of weeks ago, we had, everybody was animated and we were all talking at the same time about something, and I said to my son [Jason Ransby-Sporn], "You know, you keep cutting me off." And he said, "Well, that's what we do, we all, we're all trying to get our word in." So, I think both of my children are very confident. My son works as an energy analyst for a non profit, and my daughter [Asha Ransby-Sporn] is a teenager, but she's a photographer and a blogger. So, they're making their mark in their own way and their own time for their generation. But I think we have, you know, we've stuck with each other and we've loved each other, and sometimes it's hard to do when you're doing other kinds of work that is very, very demanding. So, I feel, I feel good about that.

Speaker 1: Okay. We always ask this: what are some of your hopes and concerns, or major hopes and concerns about the African American community?
Speaker 2: My hopes and concerns. (Clears throat) I'm very, very concerned about growing poverty and wealth disparity. And I'm very, very concerned about mass incarceration of black people, black youth. I think that becomes, I mean, there's been work around this for years--Ruthie Gilmore [Ruth Wilson Gilmore] and [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis through critical resistance. Most recently Michelle Alexander has made the problem more visible to perhaps a wider audience through her book 'The New Jim Crow' ['The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness'], so I think not being silent about this entire part of the black community that is under the control of the prison system, either in prison or disenfranchised because they've been in prison or on parole or on probation, and therefore limited in what they can do. I think that's a major concern. I also want us to bear in mind that we live in a global political community, so it's never just about the United States, and it's never just about African Americans. There's a black diaspora that's in every corner of the globe, and there are, you know, black and brown and many white people all over the world struggling for the kind of society and the kind of values and ideals and politics that I think have animated the black freedom movement. So I think those two things, kind of internationalism, appreciation for, you know, feminine sensibilities and women's contribution, inclusion of queer people and disabled people in the mix--to be generous in that way, not narrow and self-focused. But also to focus on the most oppressed sectors, which is I think those people who are incarcerated, some of them for very minor offenses that come out of an economic injustice. So, I think that has to be a priority.

Speaker 1: Is there anything major that you would, that you wish you could redo if you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, what do I wish I could redo? Oh, getting the Ella Baker ['Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision,' Barbara Ransby] done quicker, perhaps. Uh, I don't know. That would probably be, that would be a professional thing I would have done differently. Taking more time to do more reading when I was an activist and keeping my hands in more activism when I was doing my research. I think I've kept a sort of political family balance. I mean, my husband [Peter H. Sporn] is a physician, and has been a wonderful supporter of me while he's also done his work around access to healthcare, and you know, other kinds of things. So, I think, but I think sometimes the both of us, we're busy with other things and we support each other, that sometimes just being still with the family, you know, might be, might be good therapy for all of us, but it's, you know, not enough time in the day.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to raise before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You've asked me quite a lot of questions, my friend (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Well, the last question, this is the last one.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's similar to legacy, but a little different. How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Ooh, how would I like to be remembered? I remember when Shirley Chisholm was asked that question, you know, in Shola Lynch's film ['Chisholm '72: Unbought and Unbossed']. I don't know. That's a heavy question. Being fair is very important to me. It sounds like a small thing, being fair to the people that I worked with, being honest about the work that I do and what I believe, in situations where it's difficult and not popular. I think in being kind and generous and principled. I think being principled is probably really important to me. If I were to be accused of being unprincipled about something, I think that really would kind of cut to the core, because I spend a lot of time thinking about what's the right thing to do. And I am sure I don't always do exactly the right thing according to my principles. But I really do try. So, you know, those are the things. I mean I hope that I sort of cliched it that you hope you leave the world a little bit better than the way you found it. And I think that's true. And it's true because I've done collective work and not just individual work. So the credit is not just mine.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you so much.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Thank you.
