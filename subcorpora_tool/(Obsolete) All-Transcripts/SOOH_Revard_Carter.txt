 Neurohr and I am a librarian for Oklahoma State  University. Today is November 18, 2009 and I   m in Pawhuska,  Oklahoma in the Council Room for the Osage Nation. I   m here to  interview Dr. Carter Revard. Thank you Dr. Revard for coming and  allowing me to interview you today.  I am delighted that you have come here and I am happy to be  interviewed.  Could you tell me a little about yourself, please?  I was born in this town, Pawhuska, in 1931. It   s the Osage Agency town  and my mother later married for a second marriage my stepfather who  was full blood Osage or almost full blood. We moved shortly after they  were married out twenty miles from here   East into the Buck Creek  Valley and I grew up there. It is an eighty acre   mostly bluestem  meadow place and we had a very nice house. I   ve written about it in  Family Matters, Tribal Affairs and so on.  I went to the one-room country school a mile east of our house. We   d  walk every day there and back, and it was an excellent place to go. It  was one room, one teacher, anywhere from thirteen students in my  eighth grade to maybe thirty or thirty-five in some of the earlier years. It  gave the teacher a really difficult assignment to handle thirty or so  children ranging from first grade through eighth, some of the eighth  graders having repeated more than one year and being fifteen or sixteen  years old, and so it was quite a challenge. I had very good teachers. Mrs.  Fisher for three years and then Mrs. Ridgeway for one year, but Mrs.  Ridgeway became mysteriously pregnant (she was married, that may  have had something to do with it) and therefore was not hired for the  next year. Luckily for me, her replacement was Letha Conner, an Osage  woman from a little town up northwest of Pawhuska called Grainola in  5  the Shidler area. She had gone to Oklahoma Normal at Edmond and  taken a BA in education. She was an excellent piano player, a pole  vaulter, a basketball player, and an all-around wonderful teacher. When  she came, I was in the fifth grade, and she was there for my fifth, sixth,  and seventh grades. She had her own car, a Pontiac, a lovely    41, I think,  Pontiac, torpedo shaped, and she drove into Bartlesville which was five  miles east of us. After the old school building was replaced with a new  one that had a kind of library portion, in Bartlesville she picked up used  books that were on sale, and she collected encyclopedias and all sorts of  things. It was wonderful to get an extra education.  She left after the seventh grade because she married a soldier, Ben  Wade, a cowboy from near her in Grainola, and he was sent to Germany  to explain to Hitler that he was not being very nice. That succeeded  extremely well and Ben came back. They then moved with Mrs. Conner,  and she taught at Shidler for many years. I met her again in 2004, which  was sixty-one years after I had last seen her, and I interviewed her, and I  am going to be talking about that interview later.  I went from Buck Creek to College High School in Bartlesville, and I  had wonderful teachers there. Meantime, I worked in the hay fields and  the harvest fields, and I helped train greyhounds, and it was excellent  conditioning. Of course, when I graduated in    44 from Buck Creek, the  war was on and I had begun working at age eleven shocking wheat, and  then moved on to hay fields and bucking bales and other stuff and corn.  So, I had an outdoor life and it was extremely pleasant. I still can   t get  used to being in a city, and I regard a city as anything that has more than  two cross streets because I can get lost if there are more than two. So, I  went into Bartlesville, where I got lost more than once, and I got through  the high school there. The University of Tulsa had then not long before  started a program which was a radio quiz show, and Ben Henneke, who  later became president of the University of Tulsa, was the MC  Master  of Ceremonies . He was better than Alex Trebek. He was the equal of  Johnny Carson. He was an absolutely wonderful MC, and I did not win  that program.  I won the high school part in Bartlesville, and then there were twenty-four  people in the semi-finals. I won my semi-final with twelve, and I  was headed for the final. My mother was driving me. We had a little  wreck. It didn   t do much damage, banged up an eyebrow or so, and then  a friend, Gene Kahler, who   d been at Buck Creek, gone into the war,  sent the two bombs over to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was a logistics  man who got them to Saipan and then made sure they were okay. Gene  was then working for Phillips Petroleum on the day that we had the little  wreck heading for Tulsa, and he came over, drove me all the way to  Tulsa. So, I got there. We had a blowout on the way, a little delay. We  6  Neurohr  Revard  got there and missed the first third of the program, but I took a third on  the thing even so, and that got me a one-year scholarship, and after that  they gave me more scholarships. Senior year, I took a Rhodes  Scholarship and went to Oxford and got a BA in English.  What were your degrees?  I had a BA in English from the University of Tulsa. I had thirty hours of  graduate work that I had finished before I went to Oxford. Even while I  was still an undergraduate, I was taking graduate courses and getting  credit. Well, I had twenty-four hours, and the six hours of my thesis  would have finished it. I couldn   t finish the thesis the summer before I  went to Oxford, but I did do well enough   I was working on  Shakespeare   that when I got to Oxford and had to write about  Shakespeare, it worked nicely. My teachers at University of Tulsa, in  particular, my English teachers, were terrific. I was very lucky to go to  University of Tulsa. I was treated as a bright, young student. I was given  a lot of hard work. I had five jobs my freshman year, including tutoring  students in English. I began grading freshman papers when I was second  semester there. I marked for this teacher who had gone almost blind, and  then I helped Professor Eikenberry when his eyes went bad. I would go  over to his place in the evenings and read aloud to him the Shakespeare  play that he would be teaching the next day, parts of it. And then if I  didn   t catch on to a line well enough, he would stop me and have me re-do  it. So, it was a wonderful education in reading Shakespeare, and all  the jokes and all the details and everything came through so much better  that way than anything I could have done in ordinary education, I think.  So, he was very kind and very generous. I would go there and, because I  didn   t have enough money to eat, he would usually have something to  eat in the fridge, and so when we finished with the Shakespeare or  whatever. It wasn   t always Shakespeare. I did a Renaissance course with  him and I was assigned to mentor some of the other students who were  struggling in that course and, therefore, I could sometimes say to him,     We   re going to be dealing with this Renaissance figure, and the  introduction doesn   t tell me much. This poem       and he would carefully  say,    What about this? What about that?    and it was a Socratic kind of  an education. Hayden and others were splendid lecturer teachers who  had deep knowledge of literature. Hayden had a doctorate from  Syracuse. I didn   t have any classes with Ben Henneke, but I was always  very friendly with him because he had done so well on that  Going to  College program .  When I got to Oxford, I was at Merton College, which is the same  college that John Joseph Matthews had gone to in 1921 after he was a  flyer in World War I, and had a bachelor of science in geology from  7  Neurohr  Revard  University of Oklahoma. Merton College was the place where a lot of  Oklahoma Rhodes Scholars went.  Why is that?  It began to be established that way in the 1920s, I think. It may be that  Matthews had something to do with it. For instance, Savoie Lottinville,  the Rhodes secretary for Oklahoma when I went up, had been at Merton.  So, all of the people sort of   when you were given the Rhodes, you  were then asked what colleges at Oxford would be your top three  hopeful choices, and we usually put Merton, and Merton let us in  because they had good experience with the scholars. That is to say, those  from Oklahoma did well there, relatively speaking. I was the first  Rhodes from the University of Tulsa and the only one for a number of  years until, I think, the 1970s or maybe even    80. Nancy Coiner took a  Rhodes from TU and Oklahoma, and she teaches in Amherst at a prep  school now  The John Dewey Academy  there. She got through very  successfully, but she has made her career in that way.  So, when I got to Oxford, I took up rowing. I hadn   t had much athletics.  I hadn   t had time for anything at Tulsa because I was working all of the  time. I did a minimum of 100 hours a month for the English department  and then anything else I could get, in the way of tutoring and so on. With  the scholarships I got as junior and senior, I was much better off. I had a  little bit of money, and with the money I earned, it was nice and  bearable. TU was inexpensive, and everything was inexpensive in those  days. So, when I got to Oxford, I kind of had a chance to do some of the  things athletically. I went into rowing a little bit and I was no star, but it  was a very enjoyable time. I rowed in the long distance eight, which was  a tremendous struggle, and in the Second Torpid, there   s a photograph in  Winning the Dust Bowl of our Second Torpid there. Then the next year I  was in what   s called the Schools Eight, and I found it a very useful  thing. I still know and keep up with some of those people in that second  torpid and the long distance eight, and when I go to England now, I  often get to see them and the Merton College people.  I stayed away from the intellectuals and the poetry folks a lot of the  time. I   m at TU taking part in the literary and so on things and published  some poems in a literary magazine, and I was nominally the editor,  although the real editor and brilliant writer was Ken Rucinski, and he  brought me along because I would help get the English department  behind it. So, I   d published some things in there which were not very  remarkable, and when I got to Oxford, the poets all came around and  said,    Come to this,    and    Come to that,    and I did for a little bit.  Donald Hall was at Oxford on a Fulbright, I think, and he was editor of  the most prestigious journal there, and he was told by some of the  8  Merton College poets, Alan Brownjohn and others, that there was a  young kid here who was interested in poetry. So, Hall was kind, had me  along to tea, and Hall invited Dylan Thomas.  Donald Hall is a very well-known poet. He has been quite influential.  He   s recently been Library of Congress Poet in Residence, and he had  met and been approved by T.S. Eliot. He smoked a pipe, and he had a  very pretty young wife whose picture was featured in the journal that he  edited, and he had me along for tea. And when Dylan Thomas came,  Donald Hall was the man who drove down to Wales and brought him  back. Thomas    reading was in October, I believe October 15 of 1952,  and I   d only been in Oxford about two weeks, but I went along to it and  I knew Thomas    work, myself, because Don Hayden and others had the  recordings and played them that Thomas had made in, I think, the  Library of Congress somewhere. Caedmon Records put them out, a  long-play, so they were newly out. They were the cutting edge of  everything, and I, even at TU, was asked to come into class and teach a  class on some of his poems, and I mistaught it, not knowing any better.  So, when I got to Oxford, Thomas came to read. He was a famous  alcoholic in reputation, but the man was the very best reader of English  poetry I have ever heard, and I don   t think I will hear another one like it  because no one reads like that anymore. He was far better than Richard  Burton. Burton only got the part in Thomas    Under Milk Wood because  Thomas had died of drinking a bit to excess and of mistreatment by the  doctors who gave him the wrong morphine shot and other kinds of  things.  But I went up to Thomas during the intermission, and he was standing  there quite solid on his feet. He was built, by that time, like a beer keg,  and he was not the handsome curly-haired young man. He had gray,  long locks, still a bit curly, and a mischievous face, but he was so  melancholy standing there, quiet and all to himself. Nobody came over  to him. So, I went up and said,    Mr. Thomas, I hope you will be reading     Over Sir John   s Hill.       He said,    Yes.    And I said,    Does it have  anything to do with Sir John Falstaff   s    Hill of Flesh   ?    because I had  spent an hour at TU explaining the possibilities, and he said,    No. It   s a  hill in Wales.    I have since seen the hill because I read poems over at the  University of Wales in Swansea, and they took me along, and I saw the  hill and everything. The poem begins:  Over Sir John   s hill,  The hawk on fire hangs still;   In a hoisted cloud, at drop of dusk, he pulls to his claws   And gallows, up the rays of his eyes  the small birds of  the bay  And the shrill child   s play  9  Wars   Of the sparrows such who swansing, dusk, in the wrangling  hedges.     and so on. And at one point:  Flash, and the plumes crack,  And a black cap of jack-  Daws Sir John   s just hill dons     Now I had missed this because the fact is that a judge, when he gives a  death sentence in England, dons a black cap. They   ve done away with  the death penalty now; it   s no longer done. I didn   t know about this  black cap, and Sir John   s Hill is the just hill judging the sparrows who  are doomed by the hawk whose claws are like the gallows for those  sparrows. And behind it, of course, is the scripture: Not a sparrow falls.  So, Thomas had made a wonderful poem; I had not understood it. He  was very quiet and did not treat me as an American idiot, partly because  I also said,    I hope you will read Auden   s    As I Walked Out One  Evening.       I had heard that on his recordings, and it   s a wonderful poem.  He said,    Yes, I   m going to.    He began to quote it, and he got stuck on a  line, and I gave the line to him (Laughter) and so he realized that I was  not just some stupid idiot misinterpreting his poems, that I read and  understood. So, that was a great moment for me. I felt I had met an  absolutely wonderful poet and finest reader. He didn   t read only his own  poems; he read that. He read Edwin Arlington Robinson   s    Eben Flood         Mr. Flood   s Party    . And that   s not a poem I had paid a lot of attention  to, and it became a terrible understated tragedy of old Eben Flood,  passed by, and you could see Robinson and, to a certain extent, Robert  Frost, who never got the Nobel Prize, waiting among people who are no  longer the friends of thirty, forty years ago who had understood him to  be the great poet of the age. So, it was a wonderful poem, and he  brought it out, and it was quite a thing.  My tutor was Hugo Dyson; he was my literary tutor. One of the  Inklings   a friend of Lewis and of Tolkien, and J.R.R. Tolkien was then  Merton Professor of English, so he wandered about the quadrangles. I  went to his lectures, and he was famous for his lectures. Nobody could  hear him, and if they heard him, sometimes they couldn   t understand  because he made incredible leaps and U-turns and, I guess you would  say, jet  s and whatever the ballet terms are. It was wonderfully artistic,  but not always comprehensible by the   and I already had some hearing  difficulty. So, I sat in the back row and couldn   t hear. I sat in the middle  row the next time and couldn   t hear. Sat in the front row the third time  and couldn   t hear and gave it up, which made my history of the language  10  Neurohr  Revard   exam  a little more difficult. We had a three-hour exam, and his lectures  would have helped me a lot. So, anyway, they were very nice. The tutors  and the students and the education I got was fine.  Hugo Dyson was a wonderful man. He was not as brilliant as his  reputation or his opinion of himself, but he was a very bright man. He  was extremely kind and very helpful. So, if I made a slip, that is to say,  if I explained that Hamlet had really these Kierkegaardian aspects to  him, he said,    What exactly would that mean?    and I couldn   t explain.  So, I had to give up, (Laughs) realizing I didn   t know. So, he was  helpful, and my Anglo-Saxon tutor was good. He was very, very bright  indeed, a South African Rhodes and an absolutely determined, precise  grammarian, so that when I went through Beowulf and all that, I had to  do that grammar and all of the difficult, what they call, cruxes, and my  first term I had little clue as to how to do all of this, and I was not doing  my Old English very well at all, and his eyebrows would go up and his  pipe would come out, and he would nod and turn to somebody else.  At the first Don Rag, which is when the professors all call the students in  individually after the first term and explain to them what they should  have done and why, out of laziness, they didn   t do it, Dyson said,    Mr.  Revard has a powerful mind, but he finds Oxford very strange. It   s  taking him awhile to adjust.    And they all nodded, and the warden of  Merton said to me,    Do you find Oxford strange?    and I said,    Right  now, it   s very strange.    So, then he said,    Mr. Smithers, could you give  us a little bit of information about Mr. Revard   s Anglo-Saxon?    Mr.  Smithers said,    No, I think I   ll pass.    So, when I did get about three  terms later an exam in Smithers    class and I aced it, I really did well  because I had been working like mad. I figured out how to do some of  those things, and I really did well on it, and he handed the exams back to  the various students with a little note to each, and to me he said,    Mr.  Revard, I see I   ve misjudged you. I had thought in your first term that  you were stupid, but now I see you were only lazy.    So, I had to work  much harder after that.  You mentioned that John Joseph Mathews also went to Oxford. Were  you aware of him when you were growing up?  Yes, my mother had on the shelves there out in Buck Creek a copy of  Sundown and I think also of Wah   Kon-Tah. I tried to read Sundown  once, but I was too young, about twelve, and I couldn   t figure out a lot  of what was going on in there. When I got to high school, my splendid  teacher, Mary Paxton in the American Lit class, particularly when I was  doing well my senior year and getting   I did well on a Pepsi-Cola test,  which is like the National Merit. I think I came in tenth in Oklahoma. I  might have done better if I had understood how to do that kind of test. I  11  did the whole first page or so and discovered I had done it wrong and  had to go back, erase, and redo. Anyway, I came in tenth in Oklahoma in  that. And, so, people thought,    This is a bright young man,    and she said  to me, knowing that my folks were Pawhuska folks,    You should talk to  Mr. Mathews.     So, I knew of him, but I didn   t get any of his work until I was given my  Osage name in 1952 by my grandmother. After I got the Rhodes, that  summer they decided that they would give me an Osage name. It   s a  great honor, and the name is that of a former chief. It   s been a chief   s  name down through many, many  generations  there. He was sometimes  called Nopawalla and Nom-Peh-Wah-The, so I was given that name, and  that was the time that Mathews    book Talking to the Moon was given to  me. The copy that I have of it is somewhere in my things here. I have a  copy of that which I took to Oxford with me, and all the people signed it  for me. So, I read it a lot at Oxford and I admired it.  Then in 1960-61, the book The Osages was published, which is still, by  my estimate, the best single book on an American Indian nation and its  history and its philosophical and poetic achievements in the ceremonies  and songs and so on. He published it, and I was asked by the editor of  the American Oxonian to review it. So, I had to read it very carefully,  and what I wrote about it, the sentence that is most relevant here,    What  Thucydides was to the Greeks, Mr. Mathews is to the Osages.    The  historian who started history.  I had started to try to write a term paper for my Oklahoma History  course as a senior at Tulsa U, and I looked at all of the resources there  were, and there was practically nothing on Osages of any interest  whatever, only junky things. So, reading that was a revelation, and from  then on I really wanted to know as much as I could. And Mr. Mathews  sent me, after that, a very nice little note (I cannot locate it) which said,     Thanks, in effect, for a good review.    (Laughs) He was a modest man.  That is to say, he knew how good he was, but he was, as the Osages say,  he humbled himself, he did not take himself so seriously, as I guess  other people did and should. But he had a self deprecating streak, very  funny.  In 1978 at Washington University, I had been teaching American Indian  Literature for some time, which I had to learn, and I used Osage naming  ceremonies for some parts of it, which I   d written about after putting it  together. In  Francis  La Flesche   s transcription, translation, it   s very  scattered and very hard to make sense of because it gets  printed  over so  many pages that you don   t see the lines of narrative and ceremonial  story going through it, and I had had to work through it. So, I had been  teaching this, and I had been taking students through some of the things,  12  Neurohr  Revard  the Navajo and the Osage and some of them. Some of them came to  Pawhuska with me from St. Louis. Some of them drove their own van  down. They camped in our meadow where I grew up, and others stayed  in a little house that was empty there, and then we all came over, and my  Aunt Arita and Uncle Kenneth and a number of the really distinguished  elders, I have to say, they gave us a dinner thing with a lot of traditional  food. Then my Uncle Kenneth said,    Joe Mathews asked if you would  like to come up to the museum, and he would take you and the students  around it.    I knew that Mr. Mathews had founded the museum. I didn   t  know he was in town at that point, and I   m sure that Uncle Kenneth had  said to him,    My nephew Carter is going to be here.    And, probably,  Mathews had said,    Oh, yes. I think I       (Laughs)  So, he met us at the museum, and he took us around and explained the  paintings, how this had been made and what was going on when that one  was being painted and a lot of the stuff that he actually describes in  Talking to the Moon, which I remembered from reading it. He told us  more stories than are in there, but he was very good to the students. He  said something that surprised me. I had always heard Mr. Mathews was  the first Oklahoma Indian Rhodes, and the first thing he said to the  students and me when we came and gathered outside of the museum  getting ready to go in,    People say I was the first Oklahoma  Indian   Rhodes. I was not. Professor Revard was.    Which he, I think, actually,  could have had the Rhodes, and they may have, technically, I don   t  know, awarded it. That   s something I   ll have to find out. I never have,  quite. But he used his own money and, as I heard from him and from his  stepson John Hunt, when he went there, the terms   your cycle begins in  the fall at what they call Michaelmas, September 29, Michael Mass, the  celebration, and the terms begin, law terms and the school terms. He  didn   t go in the fall because he liked to hunt, so he went out hunting in, I  don   t know, New Mexico for elk, bear. He arrived in the spring, and so  I   ve thought of him ever since. I   ve looked up his records, some of them,  a few, at Merton, and it   s fascinating to see. The dons rebuked him at  one point for looking more at ladies than his books (Laughter), so I   m  told. But he liked to hunt, and I think he went fox hunting during some  of the vacations. He loved to ride and hunt, and it made it perfect.  Have you been up to the Black Jacks Cabin?  I have, and I   m glad you asked because you would know the mural there  he painted is an evolutionary mural beginning with, as it were, the first  cave man and going along and at a late point the Osages around a drum,  singing. And then, as the culminating civilized man, a man on horseback  jumping a fence, chasing a fox with the dogs with him there. He had a  great deal of fun and a marvelous sense of humor.  13  Neurohr  Revard  When did you first go to the Black Jacks?  I didn   t go until, I believe it was a year ago in May. Charlie Redcorn and  John Hunt and I had been talking about the possibilities of rehabbing  that place and making it a literary retreat and center. I hope that comes to  pass. It would be wonderful. The materials for studying Mr. Mathews     work are far richer than anyone quite realized. And as I think I said in  the talk yesterday, Dr. Susan Kalter, who is an associate professor  of  American Literature and Native American Studies  at the University of  Illinois Normal, is editing much of it. She has got quite a few of the  short stories that had never been published brought along. There is an  autobiography that only goes up into about 1920-22 or so. There are  diaries. There are tapes, tape recordings and interviews. There   s a great  deal, and I think he wanted to do a book on a kind of evolutionary  theory.  He published The Osages in    61 and he was, at that point, about sixty-five.  He had a lot left to say, a lot of writing that he had done and was  doing, but the zeitgeist shifted and people began writing differently, and  they didn   t take the stories and things, and he had not schmoozed his  way   he had not done his book tours. He had not made a literary career,  and the publishers just didn   t recognize, I think, the quality. So, I   m  hoping that if the Black Jacks becomes a center, some people, at least,  will come and put his work together with that of other writers, not  necessarily Osage, not necessarily Pawhuska, but I hope American  Indian and, for that matter, European and so on. I   d love to see people     there was a lot to know about the classical literature  Greek and Roman   which everybody is supposed to know as great and wonderful, which it  is. But if people could begin to see the American Indian stories and  cycles and trickster figures and legendary figures   I mean, if you put  Hermes together with Raven and Coyote, and Ik-The, the Ponca trickster  Mikasi, or some of the others, it would make an interesting kind of a  study. And I   m writing poems, as it happens, that to a certain extent  bring in the creatures that Matthews does so well with when he writes  about them.  There are deer mice that sing, and I have a poem called    Deer Mice  Singing Up Parnassus    because I want to show   deer mice are little  white-footed mice and they actually sing. There   s a woman naturalist  called Sally Carrighar who wrote in the    50s and    60s, a wonderful  naturalist, and she describes going out in the meadows at night and  hearing what she thought was the birds singing, couldn   t believe a bird  was singing in a rather dark night like that. Of course, if she walked a  certain way, it would stop. She finally figured out it was a deer mouse. If  you Google up    deer mouse    you will find in Wikipedia, for example,  references that will allow you to hear recordings of them singing, and  14  Neurohr  Revard  Neurohr  Revard  photographs of them singing hanging. I   ve written a poem  that will be  published . I read it  at the University of East Anglia  in Norwich,   England  last summer and a woman called Allison Hedge Coke edited  an anthology which will be published by Arizona University Press called  Ahani:  Poems of the Indigenous Americas . This poem and some others  (I   ve done a thing called    Aesculapius Unbound   ) on my computer. I   d  have to read them from the computer.  I marked a couple of things in your books here. Could you tell me about  those, please?  Yes. I see that you   ve marked    Rock Shelters    which I dedicated to John  Joseph Mathews.  And which one of your books is that in?  It   s in Family Matters: Tribal Affairs, but it   s also in the recent book, I  think. Maybe not. It   s in Winning the Dust Bowl. It may be in How the  Songs Come Down which has my Ponca Aunt Jewel on the cover there  with the Scalp Dance Drum of which she was hereditary keeper. Her  daughter, Casey Camp-Horinek, was here yesterday at the lunch.  Casey   s an actress and was the lead actress in a movie called Barking  Waters that a young Creek director who is a rising star directed, Sterlin  Harjo. That movie just won Best Film at the American Indian Film  Festival in San Francisco on Saturday, the 14th of November. Casey told  me that she was named Best Actress out there.  So, this How the Songs Come Down, I   m not sure if this poem was in  there, but it is in Family Matters. I put it into a kind of a semi-short story  called    Report to the Nation: Repossessing Europe    as a way of saying  Osages have been over there and we have done what Columbus did. We  went up the river and said,    This is all ours.    And I did it in England, so  England is ours now, and to a certain extent, I   m trying to do what  Matthews did: bring all that together. But in    Rock Shelters   , out near  where I grew up on the meadow, Doe Creek joins Buck Creek. Who  knows whether that was symbolic on the part of people naming them,  the white people naming them. But up Doe Creek a ways, there is a  considerable   it   s not a vale. It   s not a gully. It   s a little Ozarky semi-canyon.  A few people live up there. Spring at the top, the little creek  comes down, and I was up there and walked up towards the spring part  and realized there was a rock shelter. Anthropologists called them that,  and there was charcoal there and mussel shell showing that people had  drunk and eaten and made the fire there, and that would have been a  long time ago. So, I thought of Mathews because he had such a  wonderful sense of transience and of the human beings living in a place  and talking to the moon, Wah   kon-Ta, The Osages. So, I began to write  15  Neurohr  Revard  this poem. It was first a description of what I actually saw and  experienced and then I moved it out into the space travel that we were  doing. Did you want me to read that?  Would you please?  I would be delighted to.    Rock Shelters    for John Joseph Mathews:  Up here, bluff-slabs of sandstone  hang out from the rim,  painted blue-gray with lichens, sheer  over dusty level of a  sheltered place: water sometimes  down over places worn and knobby drips  and darkens, softens earth to hold our  lifeprints; buttercup and rock pink  live where the hickory   s branches fight  the sun and wind for power, but mostly here   s  just humus: leaf-mulch deep and rustling  between great boulders broken from rimrock sliding  invisibly down the steep slope, The walk  down through these to the creek that  runs some of the year below here,  thin and clear over silty sandstone   s  edges and angles, is short, steep, shady. Stoop  back beneath this shelter, we   re in dust,  but in this damp earth just outside  the overhang are mussel shells     worn  to flaky whiteness, rainbow of  iridescence long since dead. Here   s charcoal too,  deep under the hanging slab. See,  we were  once here.  Moving with Doe Creek down  to where it joins Buck Creek,  down this narrow shallow canyon choked  with rocks you come out where  the trees loom higher, elm and pinoak columns  rise and arch dark over earth  loamy and loose and the creekbanks  of steep sandy clay, roots jutting over pools  muckbottomed winding down to Buck Creek and  mingling where it moves from  sandy shallows down to springfed depths  and darkness. Here, the winter  16  surrounded deer and turkeys, here lived plenty  of beaver, muskrat, mink and raccoon, fox and  bobcat and cottontail, coyote slinking, quail  and squirrels, mice and weasels all with  small birds watching from the bush or grapevine, berry  tangles, juncoes, waxwings, cardinals like blood on  snow, all sheltered here from  the prairie blizzards north.  And southward, in the bend of  Buck Creek level to the southern ridge a valley  of bluestem bending thigh-deep under  sunflowers nodding, meadowlarks flying and singing with  grazing buffalo, red wolves and coyotes trotting watching  with pricked ears a hunter crawl with  bow and arrows for a shot.  Now crossed  by asphalt road, wire fences, lanes to white farmhouses  where no farming   s done, grapes and lettuce and  bananas on the polished table from Texas, from  California, Nicaragua, the orange-fleshed  watermelons that once lay in sandy fields by  Doe Creek gone, as truckloads of melons rumble  past from Louisiana into town where food is  kept. To plant here, you buy. This land  was needed, we were told   it would be used. So oil  is pulsing from beneath it, floats dead  rainbows on Buck Creek and draws brief trails  straight as a Roman road across the sky, where people sit  drinking and eating quietly the flesh of what  has followed buffaloes to winter in  the valleys underneath, on which  sky-travelers look down.  This new world  was endless, centered everywhere, our study  of place and peoples dangerous, surprising, never  completed. Doe Creek  tasted different from Buck Creek and our people still  did not look all alike.  How far, meant counting  the streams that must be crossed.  The reasons why were everywhere, uncircumscribed     stars twinkle, moon never does, they both  were relative to whippoorwill and owl.  Greenwich did not  keep time for us. Now, the small stars  move fast and send down messages of war  17  to speech machines or pictures of  pleasure to our living rooms, inviting us out into  a larger endlessness with many  centers. Galaxies, before long, will  be sold for profit, once the first space-ship has  claimed one and the next has come to  kill all those before. Think  of walking on blue stars like  this one, new  plants, new beings, all the rock  shelters where we   ll crouch and see  new valleys from.  Here   s my  mussel-shell. Here   s the charcoal.  We were here.  You can see why I would dedicate that to Mr. Mathews. He had that  sense that I was trying to get in there. I followed that with a poem called     To the Muses in Oklahoma,    which, this whole thing, is part of a little  reminiscence of a European journey that we actually took, my wife and  three of our children and I, in the spring of 1975. We went over to  Greece. We had been in England that year, and in the spring we took a  vacation down to Greece, and we took a ferry across from Italy to Corfu  then drove a little Volkswagen that we rented across Greece, up Mount  Olympus almost to the top, and we were doing that. So, I was bringing  back pastoral poetry from Greece to America and naturalizing it here,  which I think is a better way of conquering than Columbus and de Soto  used. I   m trying to bring Europe here without spoiling either America or  here, and I   m trying to show what America has. So, when I say    To the  Muses in Oklahoma,    this is the pond that I grew up with. I   ll just read  this poem because it has a good deal of the idea that I'm trying to work  on.  To the Muses, in Oklahoma  That Aganippe well was nice  (which, as you know, is up. That   s one of the sacred wells to the muses  in Greece, Parnassus there.)  That Aganippe well was nice, it hit the spot     sure, this bluestem meadow  is hardly Helicon, we had  to gouge a pond, the mules  dragged a rusty slip scraping  down through dusty topsoil into  dark ooze and muck, grating open  18  Neurohr  Revard  sandstone eggs; but then the thunder  sent living waters down, they filled  the rawness with blue trembling where white  clouds sailed in summer and we  walked upon the water  every winter (truth  is a frozen allomorph of time), though it  was always more fun sliding. We   d go and  chop through six-inch ice by the pond   s edge, pry the  ice-slab out onto the pond from its  hole where the dark water welled  up cold to the milk-cows sucking noisily,  snorting their relish; and  when they   d  drunk we shoved the ice-slab  over where the bank  sloped gently, took  a running chute and leaped atop the slab real  easy and slid,  just glided clear over  the pond riding on ice     or stretched prone  on the black windowy ice looked  down into darkness where fish dimly  drifted untouchable beneath our fingers.  Ice  makes a whole new surface  within things, keeps  killer whales from seals just long enough to  let new seals be born before they  dive in to feed or be fed upon.     Come sliding now, and later we   ll  go swimming, dive in with the  muskrats, black bass, water moccasins under  this willow let the prairie wind  drink from our bare skin:  good water  fits every mouth.  That   s so that we can drink the springs of the muses. They   re still clean  and clear up on Parnassus and Olympus.  We   re at the end of the tape. Thank you for the interview. It   s been very  nice.  Yes, I appreciate it. You   ve been very, very nice. Thank you.  19  Neurohr It   s been an honor. Thank you.  -------  -------
