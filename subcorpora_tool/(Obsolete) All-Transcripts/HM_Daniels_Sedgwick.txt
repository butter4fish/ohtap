Speaker 2: Well what my mother [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] said that she was reading a novel and she saw the name Sedgwick and she just absolutely just loved it, no relation.  All of my other brothers and sisters, my siblings, they have some relation to their name in connectivity, but its name, its significance--she felt that it was just something that she liked and she wanted to afford one of her children that privilege.
Speaker 1: Okay do you know what novel it was by any chance (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know she was sharing with me that when she was in University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] that she was in the library and she was reading some information about England and she saw Sir Sedgwick and when she was reading about that she just began to--just began to excite her and it just stayed with her.  The name she said more so even than the, the merit of the stories.

Story_ID: 466163
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [John W. Daniels, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: And we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Sure when she was first born, her name was Kathline Townsel [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] and K-A-T-H-L-I-N-E and she was the daughter, the first daughter, the first child of Reverend General T. [General Townsel], and Inez Harris, Inez Harrison Townsel.  She was born in Huntsville, Alabama November 14th, 1925.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Huntsville, okay.
Speaker 2: That's where the family, that's where her mother's family--they had a farm near the Huntsville area and that's where her father's family, they were in the Huntsville area.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side, and how--first of all, how far back can you trace that side of the family?
Speaker 2: I can go quite a ways, first of all obviously my mother and then all of her sibling and then my grandmother and her brothers and sisters, there were eleven of them, and two sets of twins with them, and then their mother and their father, who we called them Papa.  Well he died in the early '60s [1960s] so I was really, really young but the stories and the oral tradition you know was very much alive and then the stories that they share about their grandparents and their parents through oral tradition.
Speaker 1: So through oral tradition you can go back to your great-grandparents then?
Speaker 2: Definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you--is there a tradition in the family of, of where--any stories about slavery or any stories about Reconstruction or what the family was doing then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well many of the stories that the family would share on my mother's side because there was such--they were such strong people of faith, they would more so talk about the positive side of being overcomers and working together trusting in the Lord and believing.  My grandfather's philosophy was, "It can be done."  Their family--they were more or less considered to be among the, the group in Huntsville, a prominent group, the Townsel family and the Townsends and of, of course you must remember that some of the family members on both sides, for instance on my mother's side will go as Townsel, T-O-W-N-S-E-L and others were T-O-W-N-S-E-N-D-S with an S, Townsend, and so for--depending on what part of the country you may be, you may find a Townsel or a Townsend, but they're one in the same.
Speaker 1: Okay in your family?  Okay.
Speaker 2: On, on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.
Speaker 2: It is part of what was considered I think part of identity and then they used a diacritical mark to kind of separate mark to separate how they pronounced it, et cetera, because the Townsels ultimately are--were the group that would go on to Alabama State [Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] and other educational environs and it allowed them in many instances the privilege to, to be accepted, and when I say accepted I'm talking about accepted into the college, because many times they would ask for history and this that, and the other.  And the Townsels that's what happened with my grandfather, he was--with his love relation with my grandmother, she changed his name through a love letter of Townsel and gave 'em G.T. and that's how he got it.
Story_ID: 466164
Speaker 1: Your [maternal] grandmother [Inez Harrison Townsel] named your grandfather, actually (simultaneous))?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well his name was General Townsend [General Townsel] and she began to write love letters to him, she wrote him first G.T. and then she wrote General Townsel you know and he just loved it and he did it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay now you said he was born 1861?  Is that the (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: That's not the--okay?
Speaker 2: No, no that's Mason [Mason Townsend] that was born 1861.
Speaker 1: All right, okay all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my grandfather was born, General Townsel was born 1903, he was born September 8th and my grandmother was born March of 1908.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story about how he acquired the name General?
Speaker 2: Well of course through the oral tradition you get various--he was a tall stately robust guy and, so were there members of their family and it was believed that what the family was doing in, in essence was putting a name on him where he would, for the most part, carry out some type of leadership for people and leadership for that group and they named him General.  He had other brothers and--Emanuel [Emanuel Townsend] they--a lot of them had names that had significance in one way or another to leadership.  The girl her name was Lizzie, really, Elizabeth [Elizabeth Townsend], but they called her Aunt Liz, and so the parents, the Townsends what they did is that they imparted and gave that kind of intergenerational transfer to them to suggest that they were to be leaders.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's not unusual I guess in certain parts of the black community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I know there's a couple of football players named Lawyer.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, its tradition goes back and then the ones with the initials, that the initials just stand for initials.
Speaker 2: Just initials.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah okay, the General Townsel, all right.  Now can, can you go back further than General Townsend?  Who his parents were and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Sure now when we begin to talk about and then you gotta remember Townsel, Townsend.  Emanuel, Elizabeth, and what they, they lived in Huntsville [Alabama], their parents and I'm, I'm doing the recall on that 'cause it's very rare that I have to go back to my maternal's grandfather's--you know even before then is that they were individuals that were engaged in education and as a result they provided instruction and information and they were basically nurturing, the great-grandmother being a school teacher, it was really kind of encouraging the kids to further their education as best as they could with the chores and other things that were given to them, but the majority of the stories you would hear would be the stories of my grandfather, his brothers and sisters, and many of the things that they did.  One such thing would be May Day in the first Sunday in May down in Huntsville would be a day where all of them and this goes back to the teens, 19 [1900s], and the teens, the '20s [1920s], the '30s [1930s] they would gather that first Sunday and they'd have huge feasts in celebration down in--it was like an annual reunion where they would come from all over and that's where many of the stories would be shared.
Story_ID: 466165
Speaker 1: Did your mother--now, she said--you--she started off as Kathline Townsel [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] and how did she in?
Speaker 2: She said she did not like the way that people pronounced her name.  They would say (pronunciation), "Kathleen," and they would put such an emphasis on the  -line until and to and they would take away much of the grace and she liked Kathline, the softer tone to it and so because there seemed to be--and then she at--it had come to the point where they would say (pronunciation), "Kathaline," and that was just you know, just the breaking point so she changed her, her name to Kathryn and when she changed it to Kathryn then it changed that concern and she just felt good about it.
Speaker 1: Okay all right now did she have any stories of growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: Oh sure well first even I can go to her mother whose name was Inez [Inez Harrison Townsel] and we called her Eureka Mama, and I can kind of give you that in just a moment but her mother's name was Inez, and of course they had a farm outside of Huntsville, Alabama and then her--my grandmother's father, we called him Papa and he lived to be a very old guy, he--I wanna say he died almost in his nineties, almost one hundred years old and in 1961, '62 [1962] in Birmingham [Alabama] at their home, where my grandfather [General Townsel] and my grandmother lived in 819 19th Street but much of the farming and agricultural information and sharing was, was the stories of my grandmother.  In fact she even shared that where they would scrub the floor with kerosene and, and one of the tragedies that happened to one of her brothers because the, the pot belly as they called it, the pot belly heating apparatus that was there that caught on fire and he ultimately died which changed some of the you know, some of their feelings about the way they would do things.  But my mother which was your question, my mother has--had enormous stories and wonderful--she was a storyteller and so was my grandfather of a warm and loving childhood she was the oldest so not only did she provide first of all was she the first born, she also provided enormous guidance and many of the brothers and sisters become the age of my older brothers and sisters, so in a sense she was also like a second mother, you know in, in the family tradition as we'll keep going.  My grandfather marries my grandmother, well kind of against the wishes of his people because they were more in education.  My grandmother's people were more agricultural, but it was kind of a love story kind of thing and you know and he's a minister.  He becomes a--he's a minister and a barber, and what happens is, is that they move to Birmingham.  He's called at an early age to a church in Birmingham, East Birmingham Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama].  He pastors First Baptist Church West End [Birmingham, Alabama] which is in a community called Eureka [Birmingham, Alabama] for nearly fifty years and that's where because both grandparents lived in Birmingham that's how we differentiated between the grandparents.  We call my father's mother Grandmother [Hattie Marshal Daniels] and we call my mother's mother Eureka Ma.  Or, we call her Eureka Mama because they lived in the community called Eureka.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 466166
Speaker 1: But she [Daniels' mother, Kathryn Townsel Daniels] shared her story, she would share stories about in Birmingham [Alabama], my mother about some of the educational disparities.  For instance, they lived a block away from a school that was called West End High [West End High School, Birmingham, Alabama] but in spite of the fact that they were a block away from West End High, all of them had to go to Parker [A.H. Parker High School, Birmingham, Alabama], and they'd have to walk miles and miles.  They didn't have the money you know for carfare.  So there were a number of stories that she would share.
Speaker 2: Okay, a lot of stories about inequity and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: A lot of stories about that, a lot of stories about working hard and not only going to school, but washing clothes and, and health facilities and her friend, a very good friend, Matera Poole [sic. Laura Poole], her husband [James Poole] had a funeral home business [Poole Funeral Home; Pool Funeral Chapels, Inc., Birmingham, Alabama] there.  A very promising and prominent funeral business there so they were very good friends but they wanted to emphasize education and dignity for their children as well.
Speaker 2: Okay, now how far did your mother get a chance to go to school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well mom finished there and she also went to University of Michigan [University of Michigan School of Nursing, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and she obtained her nursing degree and then in addition to that she went into community education in Milwaukee, University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  She then moves into social--as a social worker.  First she starts out believe it or not as what's called a parent coordinator where she involves and engages parents in the work of the various needs that are social needs and then she herself you know advances at area with Milwaukee [Wisconsin] public school with more than thirty years of service with the district.
Story_ID: 466167
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father real quick (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: And then we'll put 'em together.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is John Windom Daniels [John W. Daniels, Sr.], J-O-H-N-, Windom, W-I-N-D-O-M, Daniels, and well now it's an interesting story.  You can call him John Windom, Sr. but it depends on how you really define his story because his father's name was John, but as with the tradition of those days, my father was one, was the fifteenth of sixteen children, and so one of the earlier kids that had died name was John [John Daniels, Jr.] and that's why they didn't consider him John, Jr. because one of the earlier kids was a John as well, so they gave him John Windom (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right so we would--then if we were numbering them he'd be the third, I guess?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: In that sense, okay now what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Dad was born July 24th, 1921, '23 [1923], '20 [1920], 1923, 1923.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was born in a community that was called Dancy, Alabama, D-A-N-C-Y.  He was the son of John Daniels [John Daniels, Sr.] and Hattie Marshal Daniels, the fifteenth child as I mentioned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I know all their names from one to sixteen.
Speaker 1: All right, but we don't have to go through all their names--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but now, you know.  What I do want to ask you is that, is that the--as far as you know is that the--I guess the, point of--it's not--I know it's not a point of absolute--absolute point of origin, but that's, that's as far back as you all can trace the--
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: --geographic location for that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Would be, well they were really in Birmingham [Alabama] but, but Dancy, Alabama they had massive land there, they had hundreds of acres of land there and they were in agriculture and also my grandfather was, was able, was considered to be a master guy who could barbecue.  He died in 1941.  My grandmother, and then my grandfather was much older than my grandmother, but my grandmother was born in 1883, January of 1883 and but he was said to be about almost twenty years older than her.  He died in 1941, but he was said to be almost twenty years older than her, and of course if he died in '41 [1941], I never met him.  Just the stories I remember his enormous sense of humor and the fact that he was considered to be mixed with Indian [Native American] and so what they would use a word in those days--they would use the word, pass.  And so what my aunts and uncles would say is that my uncle--I mean my grandfather would, could pass which is, which was the reason why he could get so much advancement as a non-African American by his hair texture, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera and it afforded him privileges but then obviously my grandmother, she could not you know, pass, and, and that seemed to be significant to them for some reason at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were very, very strong in education, that's what they emphasized for their kids, education.  In fact the girls could not leave until they, quote, unquote, would be married otherwise they'd have to work the farm, so some of the girls married early, early on just to get away from the farming community.
Story_ID: 466168
Speaker 1: What did your father [John W. Daniels, Sr.] have to say about growing up?  Did he grow up in Dancy [Alabama] or?
Speaker 2: No, he grew up in (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Birmingham; my father was a very, very hard worker and very industrious.  My father was one who believed, ex-, extensively in putting your mind to something and self-training yourself and preparing yourself to do things.  Dad would do things from he had real estate license; dad had a broker's license, insurance license.  Dad was in the [U.S.] military, he--in the [U.S.] Navy and in the old days he was also a railroad porter and before he met my mom [Kathryn Townsel Daniels], and he had Daniels' Air Conditioning--he was an entrepreneur.  He opened Daniels' Air Condition and Refrigeration [ph.] and he was an engineer with a naval ordnance plant in Lake Forest, Illinois which is what brought him from Alabama to the Midwest was because of the opportunities that were not afforded him in Birmingham.  He had learned of his brothers who had moved to Chicago [Illinois] of opportunities that would be there and he came, it worked.  He got hired, did good.  He didn't want to--in those days the father would come or the male would come and then later send for the remainder of the family and then after he had gotten established he said, "I don't want to raise the family in Chicago, it's too large, it's too busy.  What I'd like to do is we'll move to Milwaukee [Wisconsin]," and that's how we got here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so about what year is that?
Speaker 2: In 1953 is when dad moved, see this is why John [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.] told you to ask me all these (laughter).  In 1953 is when he moved--and, and really one can say between '53 [1953] and '55 [1955] because they struggled with the Chicago decision because it was so much more convenient for him in Lake Forest to come from Chicago and but they definitely by in 1953 had moved up and '55 [1955] were definitely settled in Milwaukee at 1228 North 19th Street which was the first house they bought, a duplex that I even remember.
Speaker 1: Okay so is that the house that where you were born basically?
Speaker 2: That's the house where I was born but immediately thereafter then they moved on 44th [Street] like about a year or two later they moved on 4838 North 44th and that was the house where we had an enormous amount of fond memories and that I still own today.
Story_ID: 466169
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: My mother, as I said you know she was a nurse, she had gone to Michigan [University of Michigan School of Nursing, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and she had gotten a nursing degree and she was working in the hospital and she saw, she said while working this soldier come in the hospital and she just was taken off her feet and she said she had never believed in love at first sight but when she saw John [John W. Daniels, Sr.], she just was just.  She said, her exact words "I could've married him the very moment I saw him," and so she made him a PK, a preacher's kid, you know she obviously was more shy and reserved and he asked one of the ladies, "Who is that girl?  You know, what's her name?"  And they said that's Kathryn [Kathryn Townsel Daniels], that's Reverend Townsel's [General Townsel] daughter, and dad kept pursuing until he was, you know he even went to First Baptist Church [First Baptist Church West End, Birmingham, Alabama] where he wasn't even a member, (laughter), so that he could see my mother who was also a pianist for Sunday school and for the church.
Story_ID: 466170
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their talents and gifts, their dispositions and character, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I take after both of them, I think the compassion for humanity and caring for people, the sacrifice of going out of your way, I definitely take that after my mother [Kathryn Townsel Daniels].  My mother absolutely was sacrificial in all what she did.  Her wisdom, her insight, her capacity to love and to care for people and to put others above herself, that was mom.  The discipline of hard work, the commitment of saying that it can be done, the mindset that says that, no matter what's going on, I'm gonna make it happen, whatever we have to do.  Whatever obstacles we're gonna overcome, I get that from my dad [John W. Daniels, Sr.].  My dad was tough.  He set his mind to something it was gonna come to pass and he was a hard worker.  He was diligent in what he did.
Story_ID: 466171
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is on 19th Street [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], climbing the stairs, trying to crawl up, it was a duplex and I remember trying to crawl up the duplex and I remember my mother's [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] hand bringing me back down and, and it was amazing that, you, know that I was always trying to climb to go you know to, to some kind of height that I had not seen and my, my mother was holding me you know.  That's, that's the earliest human contact that I remember you know that's familial.  The earliest memories that I have in terms of, of a child--obviously, I have a kindergarten picture so I remember obviously third grade.  I mean kindergarten, K-3, K-4.
Speaker 1: But your memory goes all the way back to age two you were saying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --before we did the interview.
Speaker 2: Oh sure, I, I--I mean I remember that, I remember the little, I remember--I can remember the Victorian couch that was in the living room and I remember you know that, that the, the set up that my mom would have in terms of, it was just like picture, like a storybook when you would see the dining room table, the living room you know things on that nature.  I remember family, I remember--I was a sickly child when I was born, unknown what condition it was.  They never knew, the doctors had told my mom, don't bring me back, there's nothing more they could do.  I would stop breathing, and I was very, very, very, very believe it or not--thin.  In fact you could see my bones.  It is my mother's testimony that because of her faith she went on what we'd call a fast, that's the absence of food and drinking.  But at first she said, "Well I won't, I'll just do bread and water for seven days and pray and ask the Lord to heal my son."  I got worse, and she knew that she was to dedicate herself completely.  She did another seven days with nothing and immediately I started gaining weight and gaining weight, and gaining weight, and gaining weight to where I am now.  So before she died, I said, "Well mom, don't you think you can go on a fast to get rid of some (unclear)?"  She said, "No son, I put it on you, you fast to get it off" (laughter).
Story_ID: 466172
Speaker 1: Can you describe where you grew up?
Speaker 2: We grew up on the North Side of Milwaukee [Wisconsin] in and at the--in the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s]--well the '50s [1950s], the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s].  The North Side of Milwaukee was primarily German, and so in your classrooms you may have been the only African American in the class or the only definitely if you were--you would be the only African American boy you know give or take, but the--Milwaukee as a community, population in terms of diversity was a majority city, probably more than 80 to 90 percent German and then Milwaukee was segregated in respect to how people lived.  The, the groups that were--the Jewish community had its community.  The African American community lived more so downtown on 7th [Street] and Reservoir [Avenue] area.  The Hispanic group lived on the South Side, other than that primarily it was African--well European.  So anyone who lived outside of those boundaries, you'd then lived in other worlds as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which, which is a good thing because you were able also to experience the cultures and get more of a global perspective but they also had challenges.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now did--were you raised in a large house or was it?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure as a matter of fact our home was rather large, we had--I would say that there were four official bedrooms (laughter) and living room, dining room, den, kitchen, family room, two fireplaces, et cetera.  At the same time there were six boys and two girls.  So the four boys stayed in one room and we called that room the big room.  The reason we called it the big room is because no one had squatter's rights to claim that it was their room so since it was all four of our room, we called it the big room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my older brothers Roosevelt [Roosevelt Daniels] and John [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.]--they, it was really their bed but they had to share it with their little brothers, Reggie [Reginal Daniels] and Seggie [HistoryMaker Bishop Sedgwick Daniels] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Reggie and Seggie.
Story_ID: 466173
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well first of all you know when you talk about the sights and sounds and, and smells you think of first of all, every day the consistency of mom [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] cooking, her praying, the smell of fried chicken, the playing out in the yard.  Because when we moved on 44th Street from 19th Street [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], there was the belief that--by some of the people who lived in that area that this lady and her husband [John W. Daniels, Sr.] with all of these kids, and they'll be running up and down the street.  My mom was very strict in terms of where we could play and what we could do.  We could play in the backyard or in the parks.  We couldn't run play out in the streets, we didn't play out in the front yard and things of that nature because she was very, very sensitive to the neighbors and wanted to make sure that this group of, this gang of Daniels didn't take over the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some of the other sounds were the sounds of laughter.  There was a lot of laughter, a lot of love, a lot of comedy; never a dull moment in the Daniels' home.  It was a place of peace, a place of acceptance.  My father instilled in us to look after each other and to protect each other, to care for each other to--my father loved his wife and his children, unquestionably, and my mother loved her husband and her children.  So we had settings.  In other words my dad had a seat, dad ate first, we knew that mom was gonna feed dad and dad was gonna make sure all the kids ate.
Speaker 1: Okay, any more sights and sounds and smells (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Sure, you know next door to our house was also at that time, there was a lot of green space and we called it the woods you know as kids you know, you know, we could call it the forest the woods, whatever, I mean you know, but it was the woods and there they would--my older brothers would make tree houses and things of that nature and they would intentionally make the first plank higher than my younger brother Reggie [Reginal Daniels] and I could reach, so that whatever was going on up there that we were not privy to it, until we learned how to climb trees to go up to the tree house.  It was their private paradise and it was just, you know just exciting.  So there was a lot of love, my sister, my older sister was a comedian she was you know, she was just the love and life of everything and she was just jubilant you know.  It was a lot, a lot of good things, reading, music, my mother believed that, that the girls should go to modeling school, the boys should go to the Cub Scouts, the Webelos, the you know, Junior Achievement [Junior Achievement USA], all of those kinds of--so it was a lot of engagement.  My oldest brother [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.] was also a pianist so there was music in the house, there was a lot of activities and then the, my, my brothers with the diversity of you know their girlfriends and all of the rest of 'em--a lot going on then.
Story_ID: 466174
Speaker 1: What things interested you the most when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I think that first of all we were always taught to care for others.  We were taught to be concerned, we were taught to--educational values and to obtain knowledge and information and to be and to learn as best as you can, to provide for yourself some stability and to--work ethics.  Some of the things that would happen is, is that my sister who now has the Burger Kings, the Pizza Huts, the Auntie Anne's all of the rest of those things, she would run the Kool-Aid stand that was on the corner of 44th [Street] and Hampton [Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and my younger brother [Reginal Daniels] and I and my sister Val [Valerie Daniels-Carter], we would have the Kool-Aid stand.  Unfortunately, she ended up with all of the money (laughter).  We had the experience, we would get maybe a quarter to buy a chip but she would save the money.  In addition to that because we were in Wisconsin there would be the shoveling of snow and the raking of leaves.  So she would be the manager of the--you know group to go out and rake the leaves and shovel the snow.  If we would get a dollar a house or--that was a lot of money.  I'm talking about for each of us, but I think that she charged five--five dollars or ten dollars, you know, for the snow shoveling and but that was kind of interesting.  Walking kids to school that were younger than us--the neighborhood entrusted our family because of the values that my mom [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] and dad [John W. Daniels, Sr.] brought so there were a lot of things that  we would--entrepreneurial, educational, the library, the arts you know just wonderful opportunities that we had growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had it better than the older group, so they say.  You know you hear the horror stories of the older group you know and all like that but we didn't you know the younger group of us it was wonderful.
Story_ID: 466175
Speaker 1: By the time that you came along was the neighborhood blacker, I mean in terms of (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, a little more but not really.  In fact our street [44th Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] we had, I would say maybe on our side of the street there was one other black family, Ms. Jones [ph.].  Across the street there may have been four families, the Blands [ph.], the Meyers [ph.], the Byers [ph.] and Ms. Linzie [ph.], and Ms. Linzie seemed to really be someone that touched the life of John [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.] and such and she was kind of like, she would be our Bethune, Bethune, Cookman, Mary McLeod Bethune for him, you know because she was into a lot of empowerment kind of things and enhancement things, but those were--but other than that and on the other side of the alley it was all white.  So it didn't really change--the neighborhood didn't change.  My dad [John W. Daniels, Sr.] said, "Twenty years from now you won't know the neighborhood," and that was pretty much the case.  You know twenty years down the road it did change.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know as it is now.
Story_ID: 466176
Speaker 1: I suppose church was a large part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was an enormous part of our growing up.  Church experience, especially for the young group and my older brother--the Pentecostal church had church seemingly every night.  I mean every single night there was--you were not without a church or worship opportunity, and then on Sundays they would start early and they would go all day.  So there was never--and our faith was very much a part--my father [John W. Daniels, Sr.] because he still worked in Illinois if you'll remember.  My mother [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] was not driving, she, she didn't drive for many, many years.  So we would take the bus to church.  The 30 Sherman [Route 30-30X: Sherman-Wisconsin] at that time that was the end of the bus line was one block almost behind the house.  I can tell you every street between here, and our church was on the other side of town because again this community where we're living now was not African American so we'd have to take the bus for forty-five minutes to get to church and back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If my father had gotten back home by the time church time, he would take us, and definitely if he arrived he would pick us back up.  He knew where to find us, and that was at church.
Speaker 1: Okay so what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: At that time it was West Side Church of God in Christ, 320 North 33rd Street [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  The founding pastor was Felix G. Lewis.  If he were living now he would be about one 104 years old.  He was a foreman at the Milwaukee Road [Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad] which afforded him the privilege to see to a lot of new people that had come to town getting jobs.  He was also a businessman, had a grocery store and some other things so it worked out you know pretty good. His wife was a missionary; she'd be about the same, Bea Willie Lewis [Bewillie Lewis], just a fantastic couple.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had eight kids too.
Speaker 1: So did the church afford you various leadership roles?
Speaker 2: The church afforded me an, an enormous amount of leadership role and because I was so engaged in the church from the very beginning from the Sunshine Band [International Sunshine Band] to the Puritans to the youth leadership.  I, by the time I was a teenager I was the assistant Sunday school superintendent; I was on the board of trustees of the church.  I was the choir president, choir director; I was engaged in the building fund committee of the church.  We were engaged in traveling as youngsters, as teenagers across the country.  We did various recordings, musical recordings.  My sister Valerie [Valerie Daniels-Carter] being the director of the choir and we were just able to do a number of things as it related to--church really became for, for Valerie and I--that just became our whole passion.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 466177
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, I was saying and for me, I think that what also inspired that is that my father [John W. Daniels, Sr.] also, my [maternal] grandfather [General Townsel] and my father now dies (unclear), they die seven months apart.  My grandfather dies in '72 [1972], September.  My father dies in April of '73 [1973], April 25th. And so at that time it's a, an enormous void and a shift that happens in my life because my grandfather who to me was the most prolific, profound orator that I'd ever seen in my life.  I watched him with many things in the Civil Rights Movement down Birmingham [Alabama] and all of the things that had happened.  My mother [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] would send us down during the summertime to Birmingham so we could maintain that you know Baptist sagacity and the things that were necessary to envelope our tradition and, and that southern style and appreciation so we would never lose that and so with both of them dying suddenly, my grandfather died of a heart attack.  He was teaching the ministers homiletics at the Baptist College [Birmingham Baptist College; Birmingham-Easonian Baptist Bible College] in Birmingham and sat in a chair and just nodded his head and died.  My father was at home and he was talking--my mother had given him, had fed him lunch and he went to take a nap.  This is after my [maternal] grandmother [Inez Harrison Townsel] had moved home and by the time he walked from the kitchen to the bedroom, which was not that far, and he was lying there for a few minutes.  He called my mother and by the time my mother got there a few seconds later he was gone.  So that void in my life caused me to have to search for a faith so that I would have something to embrace and because it was so en--entrenched in me and I, I became infused with my faith.
Speaker 2: Okay now you were sixteen I guess when you (unclear)?
Speaker 1: No, I was younger than sixteen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or seventeen.
Speaker 1: I was thirteen when--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When my father and my grandfather died, yeah I, I was thirteen.
Speaker 2: Okay so you were in the last?
Speaker 1: Thirteen or fourteen, yeah.
Speaker 2: Last year in grade school I guess?
Speaker 1: No, I was actually in middle school. Well, in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] they have middle school, they had--well junior high is what they called it.  That's where I was, I was at Edison [Edison Middle School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] which is not far from here and you must remember that so many things changed because I had a paper route 'cause my dad taught us to do everything you know independently as well and, but on Sunday mornings at four a.m. when the Sunday paper had to be delivered the big heavy papers and it's the winter--my dad was involved in that, because he would take us, he would get up and literally take us to the station and sort the papers and do all this kind of engagement and believe it or not my route--this, this is ironic, my paper route was from right here where our church [West Side Church of God in Christ, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] is, a mile west of us.  I covered this entire area as a kid as a paperboy (laughter), door-to-door meeting people, talking.
Story_ID: 466178
Speaker 1: What school did you start?  What was your first school?
Speaker 2: Well first was 35th Street School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], ironically again if you notice when you tried to find your way around here, you saw a sign that said 35th Street School and 35th Street School has partnered with our you know facility here to house their fourth through eighth graders and public school was our tradition and so 35th Street School on the--and Edison Middle School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] which is now closed, and then Custer High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] which was one block away from my house, which goes back to the irony of West End High [West End High School, Birmingham, Alabama] and Custer High, you know my mom [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] one block away she had to go somewhere else.  I'm one block away I had the privilege of going right in my neighborhood school.
Speaker 1: Okay all right, so it's all right here in the neighborhood right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay did you have a favorite course to study in school?
Speaker 2: I found myself really being interested in math, I found myself in terms of favorite subjects.  I tend to like literature and I loved history.  I, and, but with history what I think really would be the driving point was not only the what, but the how and the why of it, and, and the outcome.  What--you know assessing the whole, the whole picture, it was just intriguing to me.
Speaker 1: Okay did you have favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes, some of my favorite teacher--my absolute favorite teacher was my middle school math teacher whose name was Mrs. Stornoli.  My kindergarten (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You have--can you spell that?
Speaker 2: And I believe that's S-T-O-R-N-O-L-I and Mrs. Tinclay [ph.], who was my English teacher and Mrs. Thornton [ph.] who was my kindergarten teacher and my principal, my favorite principal was Mrs. Thornberry [ph.].  Mrs. Thornberry she was about--she was a gray head--headed lady with, and she had to be--you know of course they seemed so ancient then but you know but of course now that I have gray it doesn't seem to be as bad but she had to be seemingly in her seventies, but she was such a stateswoman.  She was so dignified and poised and--I won there, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Oratorical Contest under Mrs. Thornburg [sic.], which in our community, even to have such a thing was you know, was not a norm, and I think I won ten dollars, first--aw man, ten dollars.
Speaker 1: Did you do the I Have a Dream speech (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I Have a Dream, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I Have a Dream.
Speaker 1: Was this after he [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had passed?
Speaker 2: This was after he had passed and it was over the public address system and the office, the first time I had ever spoken over the public address system going throughout the entire school, it was you know just really different.
Speaker 1: Now did you have it memorized or did you have to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Memorized.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would, I could not take such an opportunity and take it to chance to forget something and not go--I mean I went over it and over it and over it and over it and over it.
Story_ID: 466179
Speaker 1: Did you go to high school at Custer [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Sure, I went to high school at Custer with the exception of our older brothers and sisters.  The majority of us and even some of the older ones did.  We all went to Custer High School, and they called themselves at that time the Custer Indians you know until later there became issues over you know whether, you know you know kind of diversity things, but they were called the Custer Indians.  My favorite teacher there was believe it or not my typing teacher Ms. Welch [ph.].  Ms. Welch was a--the type of person that inspired you to tell you that you can do it.  My life was totally different, my world was totally different.  I felt in a real way a need to support and be there for my mom [Kathryn Townsel Daniels], though she was a tower of strength I just felt like you know I wanted to make sure that I was there for her and whatever she needed that in, in a real way that I was her ears you know whatever she needed.  I even learned in high school there was a guy whose name was Mr. Capasin [ph.], an old Italian guy and my mother wanted to add a room on to her house and Mr. Capasin, he was about a three hundred pound guy and he was too heavy to really build, but he built the room onto the house but he used cheap labor.  The cheap labor he used was me (laughter).  He taught me how to build a room onto the house.  I can see him now, "Seggie [HistoryMaker Bishop Sedgwick Daniels] boy, Seggie boy take the hammer, hold it like this, nail it like this, do it like that, do--you know put the wood there," and you know but I learned to build.  Believe it or not that learning to build has stayed with me for the rest of my life as now we build and transform lives here on our campus and across our region in our dioceses.
Speaker 1: Okay, now were you, were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: I was, I never got in trouble.  In fact part of it is not because I didn't want to and part of it not because I didn't have an opportunity to but I had made a commitment to my [maternal] grandmother [Inez Harrison Townsel] who now was living--before my father [John W. Daniels, Sr.] died--I missed this.  When my [maternal] grandfather [General Townsel] died, my father literally moved the house next door to our home in the area that we call the woods, he moved that house it was a duplex from off of Appleton Avenue and he put my grandmother in that home.  My grandmother and my mother became in a real way similar to a biblical account with Timothy of Lois and Eunice.  So they began to impart intergenerational knowledge and they began to impart in, information.  My grandmother always said, my mother is depending on you.  "Your mother's depending you," you know.  "We need you to go to school and do this and do that and do the other and make her proud," and that was a lot of my motivating force to do and I did.  I was kind of like easy to get along with and because I embraced an enormous amount of Christian values, it caused me to be separated from a lot of distracters that normally some of the guys that now in the school, et cetera were engaging themselves in.  I, I didn't do it.
Story_ID: 466180
Speaker 1: Now I know that sanctified homes had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sanctified homes don't drink, don't smoke, don't use profanity, don't party, don't listen to what is considered worldly music or whatever.  So it's a very, very conservative and very, very restrictive and confined in a, in a--in some--in the eyes of some lifestyle.  And so I embraced it early on and as a result many of the fathers and mothers of the church, the Church of God in Christ--I then became their, quote unquote, boy, meaning a lot of the older ladies they took me in as their son, their grandson.  People who were convalescent--I became their driver for them at sixteen and people who were in wheelchairs and in nursing homes and senior high rise and, and a number of benevolent things and, and taking time out.  Those were the things that I began to get engaged and involved in.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: And music and choir and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.
Speaker 2: And then ministry, you know so I began to start studying a lot of the--you know because obviously my [maternal] grandfather's [General Townsel] impact and then I began to start studying the lives of ministers and what they do and how they do it and, and what was lacking in our faith and, and what we needed to do to enhance our community and make life better---the quality of life better for people.
Speaker 1: Okay all right meanwhile you were going through, you were a member of these what Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.]?  You were---
Speaker 2: Well, you gotta remember now, the Junior Achievement [Junior Achievement USA] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America]?
Speaker 2: --Boys, Webelos, Cub Scouts, my mother [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] had us in--if there were any kind of program, quality, enhancing program that she thought would make it better for us, she would make enormous sacrifices for things she just didn't have, to make sure that her children had those kind of opportunities.  Words cannot express what she would do and the, you know the length of her sacrifice for her kids.  You know she just lived her life through her kids and her church and her faith.  And we then became benefactors of those things.  I was not part of Jack and Jill, I was part of a number of other things that were in the neighborhood [in Milwaukee, Wisconsin], 'cause you must remember again that now the group of the Jack and Jill people were more so still south of us and the neighborhood is still somewhat changing but now mom is now driving but still at the same time you know we're not--I'm just not a (unclear).  My older brothers and sisters are going off to school, they're going off to college you know the house is changing.  Things are different, you're getting more control you know.  It was both good and different.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Now you're an uncle and you're not old enough to even understand what uncle means you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 466181
Speaker 1: Were you popular in high school [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: You know what--very.  I think that my popularity was more so because of my personality. I was the guy that people liked talking to, having fun with.  I was the kind of guy that didn't get in trouble so I was very safe.  I was the guy who the parents would say, "Stick around him, he's going places," kind of guy.
Speaker 1: Not the one they shoo off the porch (laughter).
Speaker 2: There you go, there you go, I've never had problems with people.  In fact my mother [Kathryn Townsel Daniels] had certain rules, be home with the sun goes down, you didn't have to have a watch when the sun, would go down.  A, a phone call was a dime and she would say, "A dime can save a lot of worries."  So she had a lot of sage sayings, so I was the kind that was always received and embraced.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Even with school administration, I mean school--I, you know many times administrators and as being and have been an administrator and am administrator.  Many times you know the kids that are--you know that are challenges, but sometimes there are kids that come through the system and come through your school that you don't know because they don't create any waves.  Then there are those kids that you learn because they provide this kind of little flavor and I think sometimes that, that's what I did, sometimes.  Well, one reason I know is because the attendance monitor and I we got along fantastic.  Only a block away but sometimes I was not at school at 8:05.
Speaker 1: Okay so where were, I mean (laughter).
Speaker 2: I--well here's what would happen.  Remember I told you that the holiness church [Church of God in Christ] stayed in late so that, that morning at 7:30 I'm taking my bath or getting ready or whatever and all you have a whole group of people.  You know I'm out so what happens is I'm walking down the--the bell rings at 8:05, I'm walking in maybe 8:05, 8:06, whatever, you knows in that nature, and I just, and I'm talking going by the teacher's room laughing and talking, speaking.  Going by the principal's office you know that kind of thing, like I'm doing now, talking (laughter).
Story_ID: 466182
Speaker 1: As a senior in high school what were your prospects?  Did you get good counseling from the staff there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no I think my greatest counseling didn't come from my school.  My greatest counseling came from my family.  The schools didn't really engage in that kind of activity.  In fact they didn't really encourage you.  What they had told me to do is to get a job at McDonald's which is what I did and I worked at McDonald's. What they encourage you to (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was during school, I mean you were in--okay all right.
Speaker 2: During school, oh sure, sure, played football one day.  I was on Custer's [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] football team for the whole time of one day, then I played for the YMCA Northwest [John Cudahy YMCA, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] of is no longer in existence.  It was on Capitol [Drive], I played for Northwest YMCA football.  I was on the front line, a defensive line captain and then I would sometimes be a running back, different little things you know and then we went to flag football, but no they didn't encourage us to do that, my brothers and my sisters encourage us and my uncles and aunts.  It was almost like a no brainer, you knew you were gonna go to college when you got, and so even though they told you, you weren't going in the systems, you still knew it was something that could happen because you had examples before you.
