Story_ID: 613105
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Douglas Wilson] side--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Lulla Mae Baker, B-A-K-E-R and Lulla, L-U-L-L-A [Lulla Baker Wilson]; she's--we all from in the same area of Gilbert, Louisiana or Winnsboro, Louisiana, all the family from pretty much in that area and so we, we basic sharecroppers, picked cotton and chopped cotton.
Speaker 1: Okay now do you have a, are there any family stories--do--are there, you, are there any stories or traditions that I guess would explain like I guess how far back you can trace your family or, or any stories like that or?
Speaker 2: No, no, pretty, pretty much you know I left home at thirteen, ran away from home at pretty age, thirteen years of age and so all I--we really did was pick cotton and chopped cotton and maybe we got to school two and a half month out of the year and I, I my last day of school was we went one day in eighth grade and I left.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now I'm trying--I'm not trying to get your history right now.
Speaker 2: I understand.
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get the rest of the family's, so if, if it's, if you don't--if there are no traditions passed down it's okay 'cause some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah. Right.
Speaker 1: --a lot of people don't have 'em. But, but, you know, I just wanted to make sure I ask you.
Speaker 2: Tradition, no, no tradition, no.
Speaker 1: Okay--so now are there any stories about the end of slavery or Reconstruction or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No because and, and during '48 [1948] from where I came from in, in Louisiana we were in slavery still in 1948. You know it still was tough down in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Now I've heard people say that before and but you really feel that there wasn't much difference between?
Speaker 2: No, no I can--feel it, I know it, you know we, we had to still--there was days you know Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] era you know we still had to walk on the other side of the street, we, we couldn't go in the front of stores or we called 'em cafe back in those days.  We still had to go there, the, the cotton and stuff like that.  Mama still had to work and get the white people kids to school and come back to us and we in, in our school was in the cotton field and chopping cotton.  We got--after we get done with the chopping cotton, picking, strapping and pulling cotton, then we'll get that two months, maybe at the end of the year in school, and, and we--it was a little slavery I mean it just, that was basically it you know.
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, I did know them and, and we called 'em--it was--my mother's side it was Charlie Baker, C-H-A-R-L-I-E, Charlie Baker.
Speaker 1: That's your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Grandfather, yeah. And my grandmother was Sarah Baker, S-A-R-A-H, uh-huh, on, on my mother's side.
Story_ID: 613106
Speaker 1: Now, did they [Wilson's maternal grandparents, Sarah Baker and Charlie Baker] pass down any wisdom to you about how to negotiate the land around there or how to--
Speaker 2: But there was no negotiating land because it was like we didn't have any money, we, we were--
Speaker 1: Well I just mean how to conduct yourself in public and with and in, in the environment that you're in not, not land deals.
Speaker 2: We--oh, okay. Well we, we conducted our self that when you walk, walk on the street regardless where you were you get off the sidewalk, dirt road on the side when white people come by.  You, you look down if there's a white kid or a white lady or a white man.  You don't look 'em in the eye when you talk to 'em about looking off, and that's what we did, you know.
Speaker 1: So, so you all were taught that when you were little?
Speaker 2: We was taught that when we was little because daddy [Douglas Wilson] and mama [Lulla Baker Wilson] would do the same thing, and if you were caught doing that you had some problem, you know.
Story_ID: 613107
Speaker 1: Now did you ever, ever witness anybody that didn't do that and what happened to 'em?
Speaker 2: Well, everybody did it you know, what happened to 'em if they didn't I don't think nobody was that crazy you know to do that, but what we did witness which I spelled it all out in my book too, what we did witness was, you know, there was--we would come on to the, the town and there was two, my blacks--a schoolmate that we would come to town and these two white girls would always be trying to get you in the house.  Well one day these two guys, my schoolmates went into the house and at that particular time it was a, it was an old--I guess he was about seventy, eighty about eighty years old probably, seventy or eighty years old, a black guy.  He ran in town and told the white policemen and then they came around and caught those boys and they brought 'em up in town.  Now black on one side of the street, white on the other side of the street, what happened was that they did not beat those kids at first.  They made sure they got everybody off the land, got--brought 'em to town up in the street before they would do anything to 'em.  So we ran to the middle, these white people in the middle and the white on that side of the street, black on this side of the street.  Well, the guy called Jimmy Guice [ph.] from a place called Winnsboro, Louisiana they came down, they got out.  Two hours later when everybody gathered there and they beat them two boys right in front of all our face and said that, and not only that the boy mother and the boy father--all of 'em was there, and they beat them boys for two, three, four hours, and--billy club and called 'em names and they'd look over to us and said, "You see this here I'm teach you all So and Sos a lesson," and then after that you know what are we gone do?  Everybody looking and, and later on of course the person that who was--they waited for to come down to beat 'em called Jimmy Guice.  Within the next two or three days a week you know they found him, somebody had shot and killed him at his house.  We don't know who did it but nevertheless the boys that they beat they, they left town.  Nobody know where they at; some said they went out in California, and another one don't know where, but the boy and his father left town and, and that's all we, we knew you know and we kept on and we did what we had to do to you know to survive.
Speaker 1: Wow, all I can say is wow, what a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean so what a story?  So how old were you when you saw this?
Speaker 2: We was, that was around about, we were about ten years old, nine or ten years old in that age right.
Speaker 1: That was about 1958?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we was in slavery, yeah this was Gilbert, Louisiana (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah you--for practical purposes that sounds like.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So the white guy named Jimmy Guice?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is the one that came from outta town to conduct this beating?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now was he supposed to be a Klansman [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] or something?
Speaker 2: He, he was, I don't know what he was supposed to have been, but nobody wouldn't do nothing until he came to town.  Everybody knew Jimmy Guice they said beat black people.
Speaker 1: That's what he would--he did?
Speaker 2: Right, that was supposed to have been his specialty you know, but the police in that town waited until he got there, about nine miles away.
Speaker 1: And then Jimmy Guice wound up dead the next day.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, they never found out who?
Speaker 2: Never found out who was it, yeah and that, that was that you know and you know but he was, he was famous for that.  Of course the guy took his son everyone and they left town, they went and nobody never knew where they went.  So like I said some said California but nobody would never know where they went.
Speaker 1: But the guy--okay, the father of the boys left town with the boys?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yep (unclear).
Speaker 1: So that's an interesting story from a number of angles.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it tells you what kind of treatment black people could expect in that town.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: But also says something that, there also could be repercussions (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: --for treating--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --black people like that.
Speaker 2: Absolutely right.
Speaker 1: That kind of humiliation and there's a cost--I mean there might be a price to pay for it.
Speaker 2: Well, yes, yeah very true indeed.  Well we was a little kid you know.
Speaker 1: So do you know if they, if they spent a lot of time looking for the person that killed Jimmy Guice?
Speaker 2: I don't know, that was all we heard that he was, that he was shot dead you know and came in and you know as a result he was shot dead you know.  We--that's all we knew you know during them days course you didn't have much communication (unclear) by word of mouth you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Well how did the community feel about the whole--was--it must've been discussed for years afterwards?
Speaker 2: Yeah I'm sure it was but shortly after that you know I left, I ran away from home you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, I hear you.
Speaker 2: You know later on during the years but you know down there it was, it was there, you're back in the field, you keep your mouth shut, you working and, and you knew what to do in order to stay out of trouble without getting beat or put in jail or hung, or whatever it may be you know.
Story_ID: 613108
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to ask you questions in a chronological order and I'm gonna get to everything you want me to get to I hope.  That's what we're here to do so.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So if you just be, you just be patient with me we will get to all of it.
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: But you--that's a heck of a story there, but so I'm gonna ask you about your father's [Douglas Wilson] side of the family, well first about your mother [Lulla Baker Wilson].  What kind of personality did your mother have and what did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother, first of all we'd, we'd get up in the morning and take care of the--be down at the white man house to make sure the kid get dressed for school.  After that my mother was in the field with us and, and then that, that's was her day and she would got back home, she was fix food for us and, and put us to bed and, and my mother, we had eleven sisters and brother.  You know my mother would have babies after babies.  You know down there you didn't--we didn't really have but one doctor in the whole place [Gilbert, Louisiana] and most of the time the doctor--you couldn't go to the doctor's office so the women's down there had the babies at the homes and stuff like that.  Shotgun houses and stuff of that nature and so that was basically what it were, you have, you a baby one day, you still working in the cotton field the same day--yeah.
Speaker 1: So what happens if you didn't go back out in the field that day?  Is it like--I know in slavery they would beat the woman and make her go.
Speaker 2: That, that we don't know, my mother was in the field the same day and all my mother, and one baby after, after the next one, that was it.  You didn't have no time off, six weeks or two weeks or one week.  You, you, you're there you had a baby you're in the field.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's pretty much it. And you put that baby on the back of that cotton sack, wrap 'em up in that cotton sack and you keep on picking cotton or whatever you gotta do.
Speaker 1: Is it your sense when you reflect back on this, do you have the sense that, that's the way it had been done down there ever since slavery and never had stopped?
Speaker 2: It was doing when I was down there it never had stopped, it's different today of course down there but during my era it, it didn't stop you know.
Speaker 1: So this is nearly a hundred years away from emancipation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And yet the same thing was going on?
Speaker 2: Same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yet you make what [President] Abraham Lincoln they say made a sign--what--I mean but, but where you gone go?  If you sign something they say you're free, and you ain't, you ain't, got no land and you ain't got no, you ain't got no money, you're still stuck you know and then you ain't got professional trade.  You've never been out of that little area that you were born and raised in all your life.
Speaker 1: So it's no education, no.
Speaker 2: No, no, nothing.
Speaker 1: You don't even know where you could go right, if you?
Speaker 2: No, right 'cause you've never been out of that area.
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless you just go, that's the only way you're gonna find out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the fear of the unknown.
Speaker 1: Okay, so well how did your mother handle all that?  Did she just do the best she could or I mean how?
Speaker 2: She did the best she could. My mother is still alive today and she did the best she could like any other parent would.  You're raised in an atmosphere; you adjust in atmosphere through your life.  You might want something, but there's no hope.  Well for that person's mind and heart that's how you adjust to it and its condition, you condition your mind, your body your soul and, and there was no other things to look forward for beyond that you know.  And I guess the same thing with my life.  So I worked hard all my life for my mother and everything, we didn't have no desire to be in business.  We had a desire just to make four dollars a day if we could and have food to eat and my mother we would fix flour, biscuit and sometime we'd have, we have syrup.  We never saw hungry a day but we would have biscuit and syrup, they call it molasses here, and the only way we have meat one time outta a year the white man let us kill a hog or cow and we'd get that, but pretty much that was it unless we went bird hunting, fishing, rabbit hunting, squirrel hunting, and that pretty much where we got meat and a lot of time we would go out some nights, some days we wouldn't bring nothing back home.  We didn't have anything so we didn't have, we didn't have no meat on the table.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we had bread.
Story_ID: 613109
Speaker 1: I wanna move to your father's [Douglas Wilson] side of the family but before we do that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --are there any memories about your mother [Lulla Baker Wilson] you wanna share with us before I move to your father's side?
Speaker 2: No and she's a good lady, you know she's a hard, good lady I mean she's, she's a good lady that went through an awful lot of pain and situations and I don't know how she did it you know and she still came outta there and then taught us not to be bitter towards white people.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did she have a chance to go to school at all, was she?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember mama ever talking about school, maybe I think she might of, I might have heard she might say she went to sixth grade maybe but I don't think that was an option for none (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Could she read and write?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother can read and write but you know she, she can read and write enough to get by you know.  She can, can read and write I think she have said she went to the sixth grade maybe you know.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's probably about as much as she, she's gotten.
Story_ID: 613110
Speaker 1: Let me and--you said there are very few stories about the family in the past other than--'cause everything, everything seemed to be like it was like right now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --doing the same thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well can you give us, give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Douglas, D-O-U-G-L-A-S, Douglas Wilson, W-I-L-S-O-N, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, Wisner, W-I-S-N-E-R, Louisiana which is three miles apart from Gilbert, Louisiana, three miles roughly, five miles, I'm sorry five miles apart, and 1919 when he was, he was born.  That's where they say he was born, you know those days you didn't have a birth certificate or nothing so we had no way of--what month, arguing what month or nothing like that.
Speaker 1: So your mother [Lulla Baker Wilson] was younger than him or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah. What about how old was your mother when you--I mean how--I mean about when was she born? I don't think you told me but--
Speaker 2: You know what I know my mother is, is her birthday is September and, and my mother's in her eighties now, I think eighty-three or something like that I guess.
Speaker 1: About 1924 or so.
Speaker 2: Right, probably, probably 1932 or something like that 'cause I think momma were thirty or something like that or twenty-nine.  I think twenty-nine 'cause mama--I think daddy was about twelve years older than my mother, somewhere like that.
Speaker 1: Oh, twelve years okay.
Speaker 2: Somewhere in that area you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I'm assuming not for sure but you know I guess probably so you know.
Speaker 1: Now did you know your, your dad's parents?
Speaker 2: Ah yes, my--actually Frank Wilson and, and my, my grandmother's name also was Sarah, Sarah--you know Wilson [Sarah Wilson], I don't know her maiden name but.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, two Sarahs, two Grandma Sarahs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have to call one of 'em a special name to distinguish 'em?
Speaker 2: No, we, we always call mama, Mama Sarah and then we call the other one Mama Baker [Sarah Baker].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what we did, we didn't, you didn't call anybody by their first name down there you know (laughter), you know that was (unclear).
Speaker 1: You're right (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: You're right, so are there any stories passed down through your dad's family about life back way back when in the?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather used to tell stories to us, to me in particular I, we used to sat--he used to tell ghost stories.  I believe that he would tell a ghost story a lot because he didn't want us out hunting birds at night or hunting rabbit at night.  He felt that game warden would catch us and so we had to have something to eat so we'd play games with the game warden.  I mean we'd cut the light we see the game warden coming to cut the light out, we cut our line, we cut our light out you know, but we had to shoot bird and get food to eat.  We didn't care nothing about the game warden but my, my parents and my grandfather wanted, wanted us not to be out there 'cause if they'd caught us, wouldn't say what they'd have done with us you know.
Story_ID: 613111
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now wait a minute, now this is interesting now for those who can't figure this out that, that--okay now you're on land--you all are sharecropping right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: On land.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're not allowed--you don't have enough animals to have any meat or anything?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: You're eating biscuits--
Speaker 2: And syrup.
Speaker 1: --and syrup and stuff and you have meat about once a year, if they let you shot, slaughter a pig.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And if you could eat game if you could get it?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you weren't allowed to hunt because of?
Speaker 2: They, they, they didn't want us to hunt you know.  I mean they, they kind of like to--took capture of it. They, the one that we depended on all, all the white man to give us what we need.  That we weren't allowed to hunt you know and that was bottom line we had to have--we to have, we had to want that meat so at night we would slip out and go rabbit hunting and you know, you know bird hunting you know to get meat.
Speaker 1: Wow, that's something so you couldn't hunt during the day when you, where you can actually see the animals you had to go out at night.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And then the game warden was trying to catch you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, trying to catch you right.  I mean that, that was life down there you know and I don't think as a young kid we didn't, we didn't pay no mind to it (laughter), we just did it you know that's all we did it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And mama [Lulla Baker Wilson] come on and put it on that potbellied stove and we'll take the bird and run wires through it, a stick through it then we roast it on a fire have, we didn't call it a fireplace, we called it a fire have.
Speaker 1: A fire what now?
Speaker 2: A fire have.
Speaker 1: Fire, what now?
Speaker 2: Have, like H-A-V-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That we--you know that was, that was a slogan but fire have, not fireplace.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fire have.
Story_ID: 613112
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So then we--what we did so that my [paternal] grandfather would tell us about ghosts, then also when he talked about the ghost--.  One night he tell me about my grandfather his name was Frank, again Frank Wilson, F-R-A-N-K Wilson--he would talk about the airplane, man was gone make an airplane that fly, and then he would look at the moon and say, "Man gone get to the moon."  I mean I said, "Ain't nothing gone be--how can you get an airplane to fly grandpapa," you know?
Speaker 2: So you'd never seen an airplane?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, unh-uh, not during them days, no airplanes nothing down that way you know.  If it did it never fly, flew over our house you know, and, and so we said, "How, how can you--how something gone fly like a bird and how something gone be that fast?"  My grandfather prophesized all of that you know, every bit of that and so he eventually died you know and but he was a good man and, and so he would tell stories about ghosts, he'll tell a story about what gone be in the future and he was accurate about it too, you know.
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: Man got to the moon.
Speaker 2: So you mean, okay so--did you all have a radio?
Speaker 1: No, no, no we don't got no radio, no nothing. We got a, a television later on but at that time we didn't have no radio or TV or anything.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But no, grandpa would just predict that stuff.  He said man was gone get on the moon before Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] became president obviously and, and he told me that then.
Speaker 2: Okay, now can you remember one of his ghost stories?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Can you tell us one?
Speaker 1: Well you know when we go rab- well we go rabbit hunting and we live in of course way, way in the country there.  There was a cemetery called Oakley Cemetery [Franklin Parish, Louisiana] and, and we would walk down there by, by it.  Well we knew on the other side of Oakley Cemetery was these cedar trees.  So that's where all the blackberries and the robin would nest at you know, but we don't go in the cemetery to, to hunt because the fact of it that we didn't want to be on the tombstone, you know.  So right across that was the fence there was, was the cedar trees and then the blackberries and robins and stuff like that.  So he would always say, "Well I was walking coming home the other night and as we were walking down the road there on the side the Oakley Cemetery and it's a, a--this, this man, this ghost stepped across the fence, and he walked all the way with me 'til I came home and you boys--don't want you out there at night 'cause he's out there."  And our hair would stand up like straight on our head (laughter), so those kind of things and then the other story he would say, "Y'all, y'all don't be over at that cemetery, you mess around and shoot that BB gun or that--," we had a one shotgun and said, "Oh So and So was out there and shot at the rabbit one night and hit the tombstone, and we hit the tombstone the ghost came on up out of it and it slapped him and it turned the man head the opposite side the way," (laughter) you know, so he was always tell us those kind of stories you know (laughter), I mean he would, he would keep us out for a little while you know because we wouldn't go in there.  It took us a while to cool down you know because he was scaring us to death you know, but we--another week later or something like that we'll, you know whatever we'd back out there hunting you know and laugh at night and we, we couldn't sleep the whole night you know but nevertheless you know we did what we had to do, and, and in those days talking about spirit, and yeah we, I've saw spirit too you know.  My grandfather talked about it, and we, I've actually seen spirit you know and, and so--
Story_ID: 613113
Speaker 1: Now did your father [Douglas Wilson] have a chance to go to school any?
Speaker 2: I don't think my father never went to school, yeah he couldn't, he couldn't, he couldn't read or write you know.  So he never did talk about it, but I don't think my father never went to school, because most I think when it was slavery enough when we was coming up, it had to be more tough on him when, when he was coming up and his grandfather.  So, daddy never did talk about nothing no more than, "You caught doing this, the white man hang you up in a tree by your leg and they'd beat you with the whip," you know and, and those things you know, and he would talk about they, they always ride, ride horses you know where you got to go someplace out to called it handy big house where they would all go gather and, and have a nice time and stuff like that, and if you're caught doing something wrong you know you gone pay dearly for it you know, but he never did, he never talk about school because he, he couldn't write and down south we didn't do anything when we got about here all you do is just mark.
Speaker 1: Make your mark?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And that's what daddy did man, tell my mama [Lulla Baker Wilson] that and he make his mark, you know, and that was it.
Story_ID: 613114
Speaker 1: Oh, now you said, you were saying in the last roll that, that you saw some spirits yourself?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about what you saw?
Speaker 2: Well when we in the house for example (cough) well a couple of things, couple of times.  One day my brother and I hearing--mama [Lulla Baker Wilson] told us don't go upstairs, they had this old shotgun house.  'Cause the shotgun house, this one here we find had a loft on it, you know they call it here attic you know but this we call a loft.  So we went up there in the loft, mama told us don't go up in there.  So we would always run up in there and we would go up there and play when mama would leave home.  That day we went up there and left home got up in that loft and we heard chicken, cows, goat, hollering up there and we broke and ran, broke and run.  That little hole come out the loft we ran across and I fell clean down from the loft on the floor right, nothing but ghosts and chickens, Henry Lee [Henry Wilson] did the same thing.  It's odd because I was with my brother a few years back and we were--and he said, "You remember we was in that loft and all them ghosts was hollering up there?"  I said, "Yeah, sure do."  He ain't forgot either, you know (laughter) and, and then so, so Henry Lee would see ghosts a lot.  Now it's odd my brother see ghosts because he was born before I was born and my mother they got down south says I was born with a what they call veil over your face all right.  And, and so, so but I was the one supposed to see a lot of ghosts, but Henry Lee would see a lot of ghosts because at night he would jump up and holler and scream in the bed and all of us would jump up too and scare us you know 'cause he just saw ghosts and everything.  So I'm in the bed one night and I, I see a ghost in the house, my mother would be in the next room, we didn't have but two rooms, it's a shotgun house and I see the ghost walking around in the house, yeah, and all we do is cover our face.  It, it was natural because Henry Lee see ghosts all the time, my [paternal] grandfather [Frank Wilson] talked about ghosts and, and I saw 'em you know.  I didn't see 'em as much as my brother you know but on those, those occasions there and I saw one, one more time was in the bed, we was in the bed and I woke up and he was on the side of the bed walking in the room and, and then I saw that and then my mother say always say, "Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy," and they go away.
Speaker 1: Now what made you think it was ghost and not just somebody that was walking around at night?
Speaker 2: No 'cause we all was in the bed my mama--when you've got five of us in one bed, my brother you know, mom and dad [Douglas Wilson] in the other room and we know mom and dad--we know a real ghost when you see a ghost you know.
Speaker 1: Well I don't know what (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What do they look like?
Speaker 2: I mean they come in here, well I--mine's was it was just a human form but you know it's a ghost you know.
Speaker 1: But were they dressed like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like, like regular people and but they just fade out, fade away, and they walk around, they look at you, you got--your hair is standing up on your head you can betcha that much you know?  And you know it's a ghost, you looking at me real hot fire you know.  When you're in a ghost, when a ghost is around you get hot you know like you about to faint, just hot, and your hair like stands up on your head and then you know it's a ghost around you.  You know, that's how you know it's a ghost, but we'll see 'em too but that, that's exactly how we, that's what we were taught.  We didn't do that, but we know we get hot and our hair stands up on our head we know it's a ghost around you know and so we didn't, it was common, 'come down to generation from grandfather talking about it, my mother talk about it, my daddy talk about it and, and then it's led on down to us you know and that's why we knew it was, it was ghosts.  We knew where everybody was at.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) for a brother.
Story_ID: 613115
Speaker 1: What was your father's [Douglas Wilson] personality like you know before we?
Speaker 2: He, he, he was a nice man, all he could do is just tell us--you know, he'd try to keep us from getting whooped or beat by the white man, you know taught us what we shouldn't do you know.  Don't look at a white woman; don't look at a white man in the face, you know.  He taught us those dos, don'ts you know, you know he was a hard worker.  I never--my daddy never took a day off, that I know, in his life, never, he worked from that I know of.  We, we would get in the bed at eight o'clock or nine o'clock at night.  Daddy wouldn't be home, but we'd wake up and had to be in the field like five and six o'clock in the morning, right?  Daddy be gone.  I never once in my life remember that he was at home before we went to bed, or he was at home once we got up, not once in my life.  We would see daddy on a Sunday afternoon and then after--we get a chance to go to church every now and then.  Then after that daddy went back to work that's all we ever see of my father, and then he'd be in the field with us, he'd go plowing mules stuff like that, he done plowing mules then he'd come pick cotton and chop cotton with us and that's it, then after he get done there he's down in the barn working on the white man hay, feeding cows or feeding hogs or something like that.  So he'll probably get home at night maybe about twelve, one o'clock and but he's gone before we get up at five or six o'clock.  Not once in my life did I ever see my father beyond that, you know until we got--I got him from down south, he got a chance to stay with me for about fifteen years and when I got him up here [Chicago, Illinois], him and mama [Lulla Baker Wilson] and daddy up here he didn't want to come up here and he, he tried and he said, "I can't go, I wanna go back home," when he did get here.  So mama said, "I ain't going back there," you know and then he, he wanted to go back and he asked her to go back and when he die he wanna be buried down south.  So we took him back home when he died and basically when he first got here he got sick and I asked the Lord, "Lord I said you, you don't--you just allowed him just now to get up here with me, don't take 'em now."  And I asked the Lord that and he gave him fifteen more years, that he was in good health strength until he passed away, then he passed away and we took 'em back home and, and down in Louisiana and buried him.  You know I was down there a couple of years ago, I--Louisiana I drove, took a flight got off that and I drove from Monroe, Louisiana to New Orleans [Louisiana], just to, just to drive down to see my father tomb and everything and the grave and did that and went down there and we prayed at the gravesite and then I got back on the bus with my band and went back to Monroe and sung and came on back home.  You know so his tomb is still down there you know but you know I had fifteen years with him that he was alive, that he didn't have to.  I said that at the funeral, that he didn't have to take and worry about paying rent or where he gone get food to eat, those fifteen years he didn't have to worry about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't have to worry about begging the next door neighbor for flour to cook some biscuit those fifteen years he had.
Story_ID: 613116
Speaker 1: Did he [Wilson's father, Douglas Wilson] have a--what did he think about Chicago [Illinois]?  You said he wanted to back when he got here?
Speaker 2: He never was happy here.
Speaker 1: Did he, did he ever explain why?
Speaker 2: He just didn't want to be here, he, he wasn't used to it, you know it was like a lot of people got cars and next door neighbor and all the killing you know, all the breaking in and all down (unclear).
Speaker 1: He couldn't understand that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Right, right we didn't--you, you down south, we didn't have no lock on our doors down south, there wasn't no lock, you know.  Your door is wide open, if everybody came by wanted a cup of water or eat would've just stop in and just started eating with us.  We maybe knew one another, we, we didn't, didn't have that, that down south.  I could go by any neighbor house, walking by and they eating I just go and just sat down and started eating corn and, then everybody there and they did the same thing to us (laughter), you know I mean, I had to say my father always said to me he said, "Nothing will never replace a mule."  I said, "What daddy?"  I said, "We got cars, we got airplanes."  He said, "Nothing will ever replace a mule," and I understood what he was talking about years later, and he's right.  I say today, "Nothing will ever replace a mule," and when I found it out, when I came to the realization I was thinking one day, and I, I was sitting down.  It dawned on me, I said I always had worried about, I always wondered why did daddy say nothing would ever replace a mule?  And some (unclear) my friend, my friend got killed in a car accident and everything, I said you know what, I understand now.  How many people get killed a year in car accident, you never heard nobody down south got killed by riding a mule.
Speaker 1: No mule accidents (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right that's what he meant, that's exactly what he meant you know, and I didn't learn--found it out a few years back.  It came, it dawned on me, it stayed with me ever since he told me that.
Speaker 1: He said no mule on collisions (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, ain't no mule ever collisioned, and those--there was a reason why I--wisdom, wisdom.  Today how many people killed in an accident?  Teenage drunk driving, you know people don't know how to drive, just get killed.
Story_ID: 613117
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you how did your parents [Lulla Baker Wilson and Douglas Wilson] meet, did they have a story about--did they tell the story about how they met?
Speaker 2: No mama never did tell the story how they met.  I never did wonder how they met, my--I know my, my mother got pregnant at sixteen you know, and that's all I, I knew, they never did--see down south you didn't, you didn't talk about those things down south.  You didn't, you didn't talk about sex you know, you'd get hit in your mouth you know.
Speaker 1: Well not even how they met (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, well they didn't tell us any of that.
Speaker 1: We have gotten to sex yet, we, we I'm not asking about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right but they didn't even tell how they met.  See down there you don't get in those conversations with, with parents.  It ain't a topic.
Speaker 1: Well you don't--well from what I understand you don't ask too many questions when you're little--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --to grown people.
Speaker 2: Right, you don't, you know you don't ask any.  It was just like tuition you know, you knew what to ask for and not to ask for and not to say, and you knew how to look and where not to look.  That was it, you should've had enough sense you know and that's it.  If we were doing something wrong mama would look at us like that.  You betcha we gone stop (laughter), and then we had--mama would make go out there and pull a switch of the tree and whoop us with the switch, and them was the little bitty, thin, thin switch, very thin, and they hurt you know and we had to break down our switch and bring it to mama and we we're whooped with it, and then we done something wrong at school after our, our school teacher whoop us or our neighbor whoop us and hear about it and then we came home and get a whooping.  That was the way it is.
Story_ID: 613118
Speaker 1: Tell me this when you think about your parents' talents and their personalities and their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: You know, it, it, I, I probably my mother [Lulla Baker Wilson] because my father [Douglas Wilson] didn't want to lead, my father felt it was always best to work for somebody and make living and then you ain't got to worry how you make a living.  My mother once said, "Get outta, go lead, do something, make something outta yourself, I don't want y'all down here plowing mules like your father or like you know like my father and myself struggling like this and having babies," and, and my mother kind of a thinker like wanted the kids to make something out of themselves.  In my life I goes out and try to make something outta myself so I can help my, my parents and I know they help my sisters and brothers you know and that's why I help so many people today like in churches.  Every Sunday, fifty-two weeks out of a year I'm at somebody's church singing and I donate money, fifty-two weeks out of the year you know, and so I think I take after her because she always wanted to help and daddy did too.   We just weren't in position but the, the spirit was there to help and so mama said that I'm the only generation in my family that have ever been in business you know, on both sides you know.  So I think that her encouraged us to go and leave 'cause I had to come back home one time and she said, "Why did you come back home?"  And it hurt my feelings but she didn't want me back there to end up like they did.
Story_ID: 613119
Speaker 1: Now you've told me some things already, but do you have an earliest childhood memory, the first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah in the cotton field, um-hm, first thing, three years old when I was young.
Speaker 1: Now did you have to pick?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We'd get a baby cotton sack, about that (gesture)--so, so, put on--they--mama [Lulla Baker Wilson] make it and put it over like that we'd pick cotton and then put 'em in the cotton--baby cotton sack they called it.
Speaker 1: Now I've heard you have to be careful with cotton balls 'cause they'll cut your fingers and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, stick all in your fingers and your hand.
Speaker 1: So how'd you make it as a little baby trying to cut it--I mean pick cotton.
Speaker 2: We just, we just pick the cotton out the boll you know, we didn't how to pick cotton like mama and daddy [Douglas Wilson] and some of the other grown people but we would pick it you know and everybody had to do it.  We would pick it up and put it in there, we learned fast you know, but yes you would get the bolls in your fingers and everything.  When you get ready to chop cotton I still have cones in my hands now from the hoe, and they (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What they call chopping cotton, just cutting the weeds and stuff away from the cotton?
Speaker 2: Un-hm with the hoe, just chopping like this and going on you know.  It's something like, something like Sam Cooke but like the 'Chain Gang,' "All day long they go, 'Cha, ha.'"  Well, chopping cotton you got (makes sounds) everybody using the same motion, you know, (makes sounds).
Story_ID: 613120
Speaker 1: Since we're on that, you mentioned Sam Cooke, were there--how would the people pass the time like picking cotton and chopping cotton did they sing songs together or did they make any kind of rhythms or anything?
Speaker 2: We, we were--and, and then our thing, yeah we were just, we were so busy just, just working but there was people, yeah there was some old songs that we--people would sing and we would listen and look and then we'll get to church on a Sunday and those things.  Yes, you had to keep yourself going somehow, we as kids we just was basically talking about the rabbit, the squirrel, we wish we could get to school, stuff like that you know.  We didn't have but one pair of shoes, and one pair of pants and one shirt and long johns.  I never in my life never known I have but one pair of shoes, pants and shirt and my long john, never had in my life, never.
Speaker 1: What happened when it got cold, did you, did you have a jacket or something or?
Speaker 2: That was all we had, that was all we had and, and then we wouldn't, we wouldn't get cold in that timeframe, we was still picking cotton and chopping cotton, if we wasn't picking, we was chopping.  Wasn't nothing when we get to school we'd have them old platted shirt and we'd have our long johns on underneath 'em you know.  Yeah, that was pretty much it down there.
Speaker 1: So it didn't get real cold down there anyway or?
Speaker 2: Not really, you know but you when it did you were working so much it didn't you didn't notice it.
Speaker 1: Okay so what maybe what 40, 50 degrees?
Speaker 2: Forty.
Speaker 1: Might--maybe.
Speaker 2: Yeah in that, in that kind of range you know?  And then if you did we would have we call it--well you know fireplace burning, put woods on the, wood on the fire you know.
Speaker 1: Now Bentley is near Monroe [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Which one now?
Speaker 1: Bentley, Louisiana, where you--is that?

Speaker 1: Okay, so it's warmer down there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it get cold too but not like you do it up here you know?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we just did what we had to do you know?
Story_ID: 613121
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest memory of--what's your earliest memory of, of religion?
Speaker 2: We went to church with mama [Lulla Baker Wilson] and daddy [Douglas Wilson] when we you know on a Sunday for an hour or so, and the preacher would preach about God and we, we knew that we wanted to get baptized and they would baptize us into a creek you know and everybody got white robe and you go down that creek and the creek like if you see the movie like John the Baptist that's why I got that tree up there with John the Baptist you know and they would dip us in the water, cows would be out there, we would eat, eat pears off the trees and they would dip us.  We heard about Jesus, we heard about Jesus and the preacher tell me one time and I said (unclear) Jesus and then we heard about it we said Jesus and if we heard about him we wanted to know Jesus.  Now we didn't know you know what we were taught you know, but somehow or another I, I when I ran away and got ready to leave home I said, "Lord, I don't know where I'm going or what's out there in front of me or how we gone make, but mama said that you, you was the person that we'll come home to one day, and but if I go astray bring me home, me and my senses though when I come to die that I can come to heaven and be with you."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember that today you know, I've been astray you know and I've been astray more than one time but I'm back now, I'm back to stay.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now what was the name of your church when you were growing up?

Speaker 1: Yes sir, all right and did you have a regular minister or was it a circuit?
Speaker 2: You know I don't even know, I know it was a minister, I don't even know his name you know at this point in time.  I think it was Reverend Walker [ph.] I think if I, I don't know, I can't be for sure but, you know.
Speaker 1: Was it the same one all the time, or did you--'cause sometimes they had 'em on a circuit when they go to different towns and stuff.
Speaker 2: Down there I think it was the same one.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had a sign that said, little wooden church, you know way out in here, yeah wooden church.  There it was you know you go in and pray and choir and sing and that was it and nothing there you know so.
Speaker 1: So did you go every Sunday?
Speaker 2: No we didn't go every Sunday. The few times we did go mama had taken us but we didn't go every Sunday because sometime mama and daddy wanted to just have them a couple of times to them self you know.  You know we'd stay around the house and so some chores here you know, cut wood and stuff like that, but we didn't go every Sunday, but when mama did take us it made an impact on all our lives 'cause we got baptized and we that would (unclear) believe in Christ you know and we were fortunate enough were able to do that 'cause you'd go astray then you'll come back.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have a--were you in the choir when you were a youth, when you were?
Speaker 2: No, no, unh-uh, no choir or nothing, I just went to church, that's all we did.
Speaker 1: So did you like to sing along with the songs or?
Speaker 2: No just went at that time I didn't, we didn't have no, it was like you're in a world, but how you get here and why you're here you don't know, you just living it and you do it.  There was no hope or nothing to look forward for no more than try to make some money and get some food to eat.
Speaker 1: Now did they have like church programs? Did people bring food and?
Speaker 2: Bring food?
Speaker 1: Yeah.

Speaker 2: 'Cause everybody down in that whole area went there to that one church, there weren't a lot of churches down there during that time you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You got one church that includes the whole community.
Speaker 1: Now how many people would be in church on Sunday?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: They were full, maybe you might have, everybody that come in and out, you might have the church as much as it hold.  You might have 100 people if that you know, get everybody standing out in the yard, those that can get in, get in you know, in and out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay (simultaneous).

Speaker 2: Two and a half months out of a year, or two mon- one year we missed it all together you know and that was it.
Speaker 1: And that was after the crops came in and all that, so it's cold outside more normally than when you--or colder anyway when you went to school.
Speaker 2: Right, we'd get done with the crop about February or March and then we'll get a chance to get to school from March 'til--I mean until, 'til May. School let out in May and then after that you're back in the cotton fields, you're chopping cotton.  See you start picking cotton in October.

Speaker 1: Do you remember your teachers in school [Oakley School (ph.)]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a teacher named Miss Feild, uh-huh, F-E-I-L-D, Miss Feild I remember her and also Miss Bolton [ph.] and those were the two that I had because--see down there when you, you didn't have but two rooms and the first grade through the sixth grade all in one room and then you had from the sixth to the eighth grade in one room.  Then they built another school when you got to ninth grade went to another school, but I didn't get that far.  It wasn't but two rooms.
Speaker 1: Okay

Speaker 1: Yeah that be--I'm just thinking though before that time people were telling you that stuff but you hadn't seen anything like that?
Speaker 2: No I hadn't seen anything but we were treated so harshly that we knew its existence.  We heard the stories.
Speaker 1: So that wasn't that shocking than when it actually happened?
Speaker 2: No not really, not really because we had heard a lot of stuff going on around there you know, but really you know we knew the white man was doing his thing you know.  We knew that we had people in the field chopping cotton or the next door neighbor, the man chopping cotton, and we knew the white man was, had a truck at his house you know going to bed with his wife, but you couldn't say nothing. Everybody knew it.  Wasn't no secret, everybody picking cotton and chopping cotton and everybody looking at that white man truck come out there every morning and that way his wife didn't have to work.  His wife was just with a white man and then going to bed with him while he's in the field chopping cotton out there with us, and had to go home at night so.

Everybody has their own problem you know?  During that time Dr. King come to the West Side and people in the ministry didn't want him on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  So you don't know how to weigh that you know.  Here you got ministers don't want Dr. King on the West Side, who am I to want him on the West Side, you know.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know with, with white people throwing rocks at you and that sort of thing and, and--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: --and could you see yourself doing that and praying when they, when they would you know?
Speaker 2: I guess I probably could, probably--some are now yes, now, I got a lot of white friends now you know but prior to that I would say a white person, a white man is a white man, that's what I would figure.  You know that I figure that a white man if, if he tried do right because of his background and upbringing if it's in his mind he'll do wrong and don't even know he done wrong when it comes down to a black person (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's, that's the way it is I mean, but I got a lot of white friends, but all you hear me always say, yeah I tell my son today, "Look you, you black in America, understand that."  I said, "I don't care what you say," I said, "but that person's still your friend, but he's still white," and, and I tell him, "Do you understand what I'm saying to you?"  He--, "Yeah (unclear)," he said, "white." I said, "What do that mean? If he gotta select between you and a white person chances are, chances are he going to the white person."  I said, "That may not be the case normally but chances are my experience all right?"  And I only tell him from my experience, but I say, "You be the judge," but I said, "Never, ever hate a person because of the color of their skin but just understand what you're, what you're faced against in society so you can make a better decision."

You know you look back over your life and you see these things happening today and that's just life.

Speaker 1: Okay I don't want to miss anything in here that's why I'm just--I'm going slow.
Speaker 2: No, no I was about twenty-one.
Speaker 1: But nothing happened between--nothing significant happened until you?
Speaker 2: No, no I was running around not working, messing around with womens, gambling and stuff like that, racetrack you know, stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was pretty much it.
Speaker 1: Now how'd you wind up working for Mc- McDonald's doesn't pay as much as factory work, so?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So I was wondering why you would even work at a McDonald's, you know a man that has been working at Goodyear [Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company] and at age nineteen, why would you work at McDonald's?
Speaker 2: Because I was outta work, drawing unemployment, then I didn't wanna go back to work and then my--this older lady I was staying with told me we should try it, you know, wear a necktie and something like that and everything and clean (unclear).  I said, "Well, I guess you're right."  Never wore a necktie a tie, a suit coat you know.  So I, I thought I wanted to try it and I did.
Speaker 1: So, I mean so you got a job at McDonald's where you could wear a tie?
Speaker 2: No, at first I was mopping floors and emptying the garbage can.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought when you start at McDonald's (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: When you start at McDonald's that's what kind of stuff and you flip the burgers--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and stuff.
Speaker 2: But later on what happened was that we had opportunity to upper management that's how we became the--you know management and everything you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you started off you were doing you know you say emptying the garbage, mopping floors and all that yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and how long, where did you--what McDonald's did you start at?
Speaker 2: Over, over right here 170th [Street] and Halsted [Street].
Speaker 1: 170th, okay so you were out here in the suburbs then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Way out yeah.

Speaker 1: Is this like, what would that be called?
Speaker 2: You know 197th [Place] and Halsted, I'm sorry 197th and Halsted.
Speaker 1: 197th.
Speaker 2: Um-hm in Chicago Heights [Illinois], yeah one is still there now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they tore the other one down but it was, it was there you know?
Speaker 1: Okay so you were living way out in the suburbs out here?
Speaker 2: At that time, right.
Speaker 1: I guess, I mean you weren't commuting or you were actually living out?
Speaker 2: Well I had a car but I was living in the suburban.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah at a place called Sunnyfield [Ford Heights, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah now what brought you way out here from the West Side [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: A friend of mine living out here and her mother and I stayed with them for a while you know, so that's what, about one year.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So we left from there and then we went to, you know we just kept on going, kept on moving, kept on growing you know.
Story_ID: 613138
Speaker 1: Okay so, so you start off at McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] at an entry level and like what happened?  You--'cause you're a hard worker is that what impressed 'em or?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Exactly how it happened, I worked hard, everybody love somebody that work hard and I stayed long hours and I did that.
Speaker 1: Now that's a, that the complaint that people have today about a lot of teenagers that don't want to work hard.
Speaker 2: No they don't wanna work I can tell you that right now.  I'll say that flat out they don't wanna work.  Some of 'em don't wanna work and making like--they come in here now they want my job (laughter), that's what it is, they want my job.
Speaker 1: Well yeah a lot of kids say they wanna get paid, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah they wanna get paid and they want my job.
Speaker 1: Well okay, but yeah you gotta work first right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, so you--who were you working for?
Speaker 2: Jim Maros [James E. Maros], he, he died now, Greece guy, Greek.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had I wanna say eight, eight to eleven stores, you know but when you work hard you know--so yeah we worked, get along.  I mean we, we did what we had to do and I still call myself today a sales person and a hustler, still, still today, you know.
Story_ID: 613139
Speaker 1: Now I read that there came a key crisis at work when the owner decided to quit or something right?
Speaker 2: Walked--unh-uh, not the owner, the manager (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The manager, the manager quit?
Speaker 2: The manager quit, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So the manager.
Speaker 2: They walk out for health insurance stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay so they had a walk out for?
Speaker 2: They had a walk out strike and they walked out and left and I had been there one day and the man came the next day and asked could I stay there and run the place and I said, "Yeah." I was one day I said, "I can do this stuff."
Speaker 1: So you knew how to run a McDonald's and--
Speaker 2: Well I had never, I only worked one day but I knew how to run it, I got--I catch on fast.
Speaker 1: So you're the only--this is the first day that you were at McDonald's?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep 'cause see you can something one time and I look at and okay I got it.
Speaker 1: So they--the owner asked you if you could run it until those guys came back?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: So did anything throw you off, I mean I know they have to have deliveries of stuff and different things, you have--stuff has to be ordered.  Did you have to do any of that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I had to learn it.  At first it was just my taking care of the customers 'til I got into it you know?  But I had to learn it, yeah I learned it and got away and took with it you know?
Speaker 1: Okay how many employees were there when you took over?
Speaker 2: A hundred and, hundred and--about, about a hundred?
Speaker 1: In that one store [in Chicago Heights, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So they came in at various times or?
Speaker 2: Various times, they got two shifts.
Speaker 1: So like over a hundred, I never would've realized it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: That it took that many people to do that?
Speaker 2: Um-hm same thing today, same thing today, yep.
Speaker 1: Well, okay.
Speaker 2: But so that's what we, we did, you know.
Speaker 1: So, also what I read is that you did a good job but when the other guy came back from his strike then you were bumped back down?
Speaker 2: I was and after it got going I went up and asked the guy for a raise and they fired me after five years.  After five years they fired my butt.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so you were--okay, said they fired you when you asked for a raise?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what'd you do then?
Speaker 2: I had eighteen job offers for me the next day. Eighteen that's what I had and I selected one, and then I worked and became my own, own one and then I'm--
Speaker 1: You got eighteen offers at McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] or what?
Speaker 2: Eighteen at McDonald's different franchises.
Speaker 1: Different franchises, okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they knew about you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a good reputation, I did work real well.
Story_ID: 613140
Speaker 1: Sir, now I've been told that you actually--you were frustrated working for these McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] and you decided you would go and talk to Ray Kroc yourself?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: So now how did you--about how old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: Twenty-eight, twenty-nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right after that riot.
Speaker 1: So you had been working with McDonald's for what about five or six years?
Speaker 2: No, when I had--be- I worked at McDonald's ten years 'til I got my first McDonald's when I was about thirty-one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know around about thirty-one that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was about, it was about thirty then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah right around that time right.
Speaker 1: So where'd you find Ray Kroc at?  He's not just around, so you had to hunt him?
Speaker 2: I called him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the guy saw me at conventions and stuff like that and, and I just, we had some tough times and where I was working at and my employer, you know you got these Monday morning meetings, don't go well, and I had personal problems, went through a divorce you know, and then hadn't took a day off and--
Story_ID: 613141
Speaker 1: So how long had you been married, when did you get married?
Speaker 2: Oh, I really, well I actually got, I was, I was, I got married at pretty much about, about twenty-one and then so when I ended up--
Speaker 1: About 1970?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah right, and then so when I ended up with the whole thing I had, I had basically took then separated after the first probably year or two years, but we didn't get a divorce until like close to you know seven or eight years later.
Speaker 1: Okay now were you children by your--?
Speaker 2: My, my first wife, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right so you had like four--
Speaker 2: Four.
Speaker 1: --children, Kenya [Kenya Wilson], Omar [Omar Wilson], Rashad [Rashad Wilson], Terrell [Terrell Wilson].
Speaker 2: Terrell, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I left home the kids was on the floor, we, we got married, we broke up, in it back and forth you know, you break up, you get back together, you break up, you get back together in between you know, and so we--but we didn't never get a divorce until--I mean yeah divorce actually until about ten years after we got married because we couldn't afford it, and then after we got done that, but, but the strange thing that happened with that we got in a fight and I hit my wife, and so what happened was that I had came home from church and I was in the house, my daughter had came and said, "Do you want some milk?"  And, and I said to my wife, I said, "Well we need milk.  I just gave you money to go grocery shopping."  And so she goes, "So?"  I just told her, "You, you need to go to the store and you know buy some groceries."  And so I went and got my Bible and I told Kenya, I said, "Well go in the refrigerator and just get the milk in there, drink it."  Because (unclear) I figured she should've went to the store and bought milk.  So she took her iron and was coming behind me to hit me in the head with it, and so my daughter hollered and told me and I looked back and iron was coming down on me and I just, I hit her, it was just a reflex you know and then she called the police, and the police came and we had a tough time.  The police came and I said, "Well you know like I was going to church and she came and hit me in the head with the iron," and I said, "just--I hit her, I didn't know I hit her, you know."  I said that was that and so the other police said, "Well--." One police told the other police, "I wish I could hit my wife that way you know," and so she--he call his wife a B you know.  "I wish I could hit my wife that B the way you hit her."  And, and so he said, "Listen, we gone let you go on, but you can't go back in there now."  I said, "Look I'm sorry," I said, "I just--it happened."  You know I'm not a person that go around and beat on womens, this happened.  He said, "Go ahead on, go on leave, leave."  So I left and that day we ran out of product at the store [McDonald's] and I--'cause I hadn't took a day off and, but it was tough times and so I went down to the Marriott hotel and met a young lady down there and we--I stayed down there that day and then the next day I went to work but they had ran out of some product and I'm the supervisor of all the store no nobody could get in touch with me you know.  Well, I was going through my problem you know and so that was happening and so I picked up the phone and called Ray Kroc after me and my boss you know had some tough words that morning and I called Ray Kroc.
Story_ID: 613142
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what'd you tell Ray Kroc?
Speaker 2: Well, his secretary was there and I just asked her could I have a meeting with her and she arranged a meeting with him later on, six months later, roughly six months later I think it was.  Yeah it were and I went out to meet him and I met him at a shareholders meeting after he came in and I said that I--
Speaker 1: Was he here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well he was in Chicago then but he was living in San Diego [California].
Speaker 1: Okay, so but you met with him here?  He was here at a shareholders meeting?
Speaker 2: Yeah, out in Oak Brook [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, Oak Brook, right (unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right and so--
Speaker 1: Was that the headquarters then for McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Yep, but we was in a, a theater where they had the shareholders meeting at and so the, the headquarters was right across the street, so I asked him up on the stage with the rest of the white people there and I got to move around.  He didn't know me and I told him who I were and he said, "Do your--the person you work for know you're here?" And I said, "Yes."  He said, "Really?"  And I said, "Yes," and I said, "I always tell the truth," you know, and so he told me to meet him over at his office and I went over there and met him at his office and then that was pretty much history. He gave me my, my start and I ended up with five McDonald's you know up until four years ago, roughly.
Speaker 1: So he started you out with a McDonald's franchise here?
Speaker 2: Yep, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so did you expect him to do that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I prayed about it and you know I expected the prayer to be answered and it was answered you know.
Speaker 1: Well kind of terms did he give you, did you have some money to invest in it yourself or?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't need no money. Ray Kroc didn't charge me a penny you know.  I got my first fifty thousand dollars for some of the inventory in the store but I didn't, I didn't have any money you know and he gave me an opportunity.  He was a good, good man you know and he--
Speaker 1: So you didn't have to get a loan or anything for (unclear) okay?
Speaker 2: No, the person I got the store from carried the paper on it, but Jim Fletcher [James Fletcher] did give me fifty thousand dollars but that was for buying inventory but you know Ray Kroc made it possible. You needed in them days at least two or three hundred thousand dollars of your own money and I didn't have a penny.  I didn't have--didn't even have a bank account.  So I didn't even know how to write a personal check.
Speaker 1: Well, which McDonald's did he give you, where was it?
Speaker 2: 79th [Place] and right off Damen [Avenue], 2048 West 79th in Chicago [Illinois].  Yeah I had you know, and so we were working--I knew how to work hard.
Speaker 1: Now that's--Damen is like right on the border between the black community and the white community I believe.
Speaker 2: That's correct, right.
Speaker 1: In, in those days right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, on the border.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you would, if you went across you'd be going into where Bogan High School [William J. Bogan High School; Bogan Computer Technical High School, Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: Western [Avenue].
Speaker 1: All that stuff was going west.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, um-hm Golden Gate Funeral Home [Chicago, Illinois] is there.
Speaker 1: Yeah okay.
Speaker 2: Right next to that.  So that way we did it and we did that and came out you know out of that situation and with five you know.
Story_ID: 613143
Speaker 1: Was it hard to get five of 'em [McDonald's] going?
Speaker 2: Not really 'cause I'm used to hard work, so hard to work to me is like no work because of my background.
Speaker 1: Okay, now let me guess that I--let me guess that finding the right people to work for you was probably the biggest challenge, is that true?
Speaker 2: Well, no, no, no not really because in the inner city you, you had, had your people could work, it, it was a find that--finding good people.
Speaker 1: That's what I mean finding the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah I'm sorry, I'm sorry, right, right find.
Speaker 1: Finding the right people.
Speaker 2: The right people, yeah, yeah to work.
Speaker 1: That are gonna work hard.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, you--that's the biggest challenge and it still is the biggest challenge today.
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people that need jobs but not a lot of people are gonna--
Speaker 2: Right and it doesn't matter what you pay 'em.  I can tell you that, you only got a few.  I guess you get one out of 10 million was a good worker you, you good.  If you put all the people in the United States out of two hundred fifty something million people, you know you get one out of 10 million that's good.  You know 'cause people have a tendency these days that they work, they got personal problems they wanna take off.  I said, "Hey so we all got personal problems, but in a global economy you have to give up something you know and try to catch it on the other end you know," and so you know I got, I got personal problems like anybody else, but I know one thing, if I ain't got no money coming in and pay the bills I'm gone have more problems and personal problems than that you know.  So I can't go home in eight hours, I gotta work hard you know.  I have a kid, my four kids I had to sacrifice.  I had to miss something, if I hadn't sacrificed to get where I am today, my kid and the people I help now wouldn't, wouldn't exist.  We make the decision.
Speaker 1: So, so how would you do it?  Did you have a way of interviewing people or a way of reading people or, or did you just have to try 'em out and see how they worked out?
Speaker 2: Well, well you got--you're in a pool of people that, that in a depressed area where are you gone draw from, you know?  So wasn't no use in interviewing a lot, (laughter) you look at 'em and talk to 'em and then you know you gotta train 'em like your own kid. That was the mindset, and you have to train 'em about the hygiene, comb hair, show up at work, how to fill out the application, the whole nine yards.  How to say, "Yes, ma'am," and "No, sir" to the customer. You know the customer get mad with you, you want--you can't just jump all over 'em you know.  So your--the same customer comes in that store is of the neighborhood, so you hire people of the neighborhood.  You hire people outside it ain't gone go right 'cause they wouldn't know how to intermingle and talk with the people that's in the neigh- neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's all.
Story_ID: 613144
Speaker 1: Now one thing I've observed when I was talking to one of the top, the McDonald's executives about this a couple of summers ago was that, is that whenever you go to McDonald's in the black community, it's probably the only place that doesn't have bars up or plexiglas or--I mean you go to order some chicken you got plexiglas and you got microphone and I mean in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And places, some places like Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Baltimore [Maryland] you--but you can go in McDonald's and sit anywhere you want.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The guy's right over the counter, you're looking at him.
Speaker 2: That's very true.
Speaker 1: The server, what accounts for McDonald's being one of the safest places in the black community?
Speaker 2: The environment of the community, you know of the, the operator himself or the company store, that we support their Little League team or their baseball team or we're supporting scholarship, or we're doing Christmas basket you know, stuff like that, our involvement up in that community and then treat 'em with dignity and respect without having bars.  Somebody got bars up and I go there and buy some food I'm gone be scared too, you know (laughter), so it's treating them with a certain amount of dignity and respect but because of we, we, we'll, we give back to the community in which we, which support us, that was Ray Kroc's philosophy, and, and it's still is in McDonald's today you know.  'Cause I say, "God bless McDonald's Corporation," you know, that's the only company I know that truly cares about--as, as a culture of the people in sales, corporate, that, that I know that really cares about the community in which they do business in, and they shows it.
Story_ID: 613145
Speaker 1: What was the toughest that you--task and when you were running your five McDonald's, what was the toughest thing to do?
Speaker 2: Well the toughest thing still with me was that young lady that works for me.  The toughest, toughest thing I ever faced was a young lady that worked for me came up to me one morning and she came into the store and I was had been like six o'clock in the morning and she ran up and she had just her clothes torn and she came in and she was crying on my shoulder, I said, "What's wrong?"  And she said, "They just raped me a quarter of a block from the store and everybody walking around me and this guy on me raping me."  I said, "What," and Jazz [ph.] say, "He's right here," and so we had to call the police, so but that wasn't as bad as it got because the very next--and we, we, the (unclear) didn't nothing, they raped that girl right on the sidewalk and people just walking around her, right, and the very next--three months or so maybe not less than that she got raped again, all right?  She came to me, just this time it was on the, on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], she came to me crying again.  I said, "Well--could we just change your schedule or something?"  She said, "Well I can't do that it got to work this hour."  I said, "You're on the South Side, maybe we can do something," and it was the second time and the third time she came to me and she was pregnant and, and three boys, I think it was three, she said three, I think it was at least just two or three boys pulled up in a van, got out, pulled her off the bus stop put her in the back of the van, went a half a block from an alley, nobody called the police when they pulled 'em off the bus stop, raped her, and drove the truck and kicked her out.  She came all the way from the South Side to West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and tell me that.  That was the toughest thing that I ever faced, you know and I--nothing I could do.  I--you know I told her that, "You just, you need to just try to find a job someplace else."  I never heard from her again you know, so that was the toughest, toughest thing that you have to go through the, the dirt, the shame of your own people is doing to your own people, that you cannot figure out what rhymes or reason you know and then the, the saddest part about it everybody that works for pretty much for me is sixteen years old, seventeen year old, 90 percent of them have one, two, three, four babies.
Speaker 1: This girl--what women (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Men too?  I mean the boys too?
Speaker 2: The girls, but the boys they had--most of 'em don't have--didn't have any responsibility but you know most of 'em are out there and you know they, some of 'em you know gangbanger, drugs and stuff like that but the, the girls would have to get together, two or three of the girls stayed in one house together, but you got five or six babies in one house or more.  So those, those are a tough times and you know that you gotta take those kids and do it, deal with them, the majority of 'em are single parent homes, and some of 'em no parents, you know.  So, so those are things that we deal with and you try to do what you can do.
Story_ID: 613146
Speaker 1: Did the black McDonald's owners association [National Black McDonald's Operators Association], was that helpful to you?  I mean people like [HistoryMaker] Blanton Canady and Wimp [Edward Wimp] and the others, Cirilo McSween and--I mean had--
Speaker 2: When I got my McDonald's, I had a black McDonald's operator, the ones that were in at that time and I don't want to say no names here on camera, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The one that was in at that time tried to keep me out of McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation], yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, so they weren't helpful?
Speaker 2: No, no, but them was the ones I had the hardest I had to fight to get in, even Ray Kroc said, "Okay."  You know so but you, you--it hurts you yes, you know, it's harder to rationalize and understand, you won't ever be able to understand that you know, and they say, still waters run deep, you know and, and so and the same thing in business you know with your own people do things and you understand why and you say, then you relate to the Four Tops, "Still waters run deep" ['Still Water (Love)'], 'cause you just can't get--never even figured to think that deep you know, so, so those are things in life that you'll never be able to understand.  You know if you try to think of 'em too long it confuses you, but still you got to be positive while you are out in the community and in the white Corporate America and still put the face on but and oftentimes they'll say something but you, you have to defend it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right so did things ever get any better with the owners association?
Speaker 2: Well, let's put it this way, when I got in they accepted me, of course I became one of them of course, but they, the black McDonald's got their own problems, you know they're people like from out of the neighborhood too.  If you're not out of the neighborhood you can't succeed (laughter) in the neighborhood 'cause you're not gonna understand how people do things and stuff like that, but you're from the neighborhood so you got, you got problems you know and struggles.  They're successful yes, but a lot of 'em is not successful too.  A lot of 'em still can get into McDonald's and get the business, and end up not having a--and get some money and don't even pay their taxes you know because they don't understand the business.  I didn't understand the business, but I work hard.  One thing I did understood was that I was going not--I took a decrease of seven thousand dollars in pay when I went in there and I wasn't going to spend a dime or nothing else until three years, 'til I found out which way the wind blowing, you know?
Speaker 1: You said when you started off you gave yourself a decrease in seven thousand dollars--
Speaker 2: Seven thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: --in pay?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were working.
Speaker 2: I was making $27,050 and I went down to twenty thousand.
Speaker 1: To make sure that you had enough to make it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, like so I knew it was something I didn't under--something I could, could not understand.  So I only, I, I went to the bare minimum what it was gone take for me to make a living, you know and I knew I had to put gas in the car to get there you know.  I knew I had to do those little things, I know I had to pay my rent, I know I had to send a check to my ex-wife to take care of the kids, and the rest of it I knew that I didn't have no time for going out, and I, and I sacrificed that you know so I didn't.
Story_ID: 613147
Speaker 1: So you, you owned your McDonald's--fi- those five McDonald's, you, you accumulated five right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How long were you in the McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] business then?
Speaker 2: I came to McDonald's in 1980, February the 1st, 1980 up until four years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Twenty-five years or whatever, twenty-four, twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: Okay so you were working at it a long time and--so you started, you got your own franchise in '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you, so you were up, up until 2000?
Speaker 2: It was 1980, February of 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay and you have until 2004 I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right around that '6 [2006] (unclear) yeah, '4 [2004].
Speaker 1: Okay, well and they were successful McDonald's too?
Speaker 2: All mine were successful it wasn't that--when I first got 'em they was not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I understood McDonald's you know how to work and work hard and how to save my money and how to take that and make ends meet, you know how to run it.
Speaker 1: I don't I, it seems just as an observer when you look at McDonald's, McDonald's has such good ads on TV.  It seems like everybody in the neighborhood eats the McDonald's food.  It doesn't seem like it's that hard--once you get one to make it work (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it's, it's tough work you gotta work.
Speaker 1: It's harder than you think?
Speaker 2: You gotta work, if you don't work hard you don't, you don't reap the benefit you know.  You know it's, if, if you don't have a mindset to work hard you're not gone succeed.  You know that's just the bottom line to it you know you won't succeed.
Story_ID: 613148
Speaker 1: But in 2004 now what happened to you that made you get rid of those McDonald's?
Speaker 2: Well I've been successful, one day I walked in a McDonald's and I drove in and I walked in the lobby and I said, "I don't want to do this no more," you know just like that, and, and so I had thought about it before I wanted to do something here a little differently because in my mind worried about me and how the Lord have blessed me to make it through the years, got my parents [Lulla Baker Wilson and Douglas Wilson] here and successful financially and, and I needed to do something to say to the--to Christ that let me get out here and work and do things for him to help more people and sang my gospel music and do what I wanted to, but I had thought about those things but really it dawned on me.  So one day I walked in the store and I said, "It's over with," you know it was just something that hit me that day.  Turned around and walked right back out and that was it and then I made, started making my transition with the CEO talking to them and, and I said that I wanna be part of McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation]. I wanna be a supplier and, and that's what basically happened and today I--course I have this medical supply company here now [Omar Medical Supplies, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], but I made those decisions.  I wanted to be--offer more back to society, you know I had, had my ups and downs my bumps and everything in life.  I'd been like everybody else, depressed, not having money, struggling, couldn't help myself, couldn't take care of my, my, my family.  Left home with, with kids who were crawling on the floor; you know I had to pay rent or buy groceries, those were the choices I had, those real choices to eat, or sleep and have a place to stay, or my parent were going to throw me out in the street, so those were choices.  You know that I made like everybody else, but what do you gain by being depressed and giving up you know, damnation, you can't go nowhere that way, so you have to keep your spirit up you know somehow even when people tell you you ain't gone make it, and, and you expect the your--my background at least, expect for the white people to tell me that for my background, but I don't expect my own people to tell me that and so even, even today you know the challenge of life is to continue to work hard and, and then people criticize you and this and that, the challenge of life is getting it out of your mind, and when you get that out of your mind you become a Christian and say, you're going to, hey look I'm going to accept Christ as a personal savior, and I ain't gone think about nobody else but Him as a personal savior,  and so anybody else can go to hell, because I'm His son, right.  I don't care what your problem is, you are not gone turn me from getting my mind off focus of thinking about Christ first.
Story_ID: 613149
Speaker 1: Now when did you start thinking like that 'cause you were telling me that in Louisiana you went to church from time to time but you really weren't as invested in it and (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I hit a hard time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got out but that, but that brought me back you know and, and, and, so, so, so--
Speaker 1: So what year did you join the--or what church did you join or what happened, what happened, just tell me what?
Speaker 2: Well in 1972, I joined Christ Temple Missionary Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois] and, and I--later on as I went through a divorce and, and so when I went through the divorce when I--at that time when I was telling you about I hit my wife, ex-wife we had a tough time you know and so I had tried to make things--ends meet and then I got fired [from McDonald's] for asking for a raise and then so I went home and, and then she said, "Well, what's wrong?"  I said, "Well, I lost my job," and she said, "Well you ain't, you ain't got nothing. You lost your job, and you ain't even got me a car, we ain't rich can't go to dinner or nothing like that," which all the things was true that she was saying, give her credit for that, and I said, "Well, no," and she said, "Well--," she says, "well I'm gone leave. I'm going back to my mother."  She said, "You ain't got nothing."  I said, "Well okay fine, let me go down and get you a car."  So I went outta my house, walked down the street and bought her a car.  But went down the street and bought her a car and brought it back to her and I was still trying to do everything to make my marriage work and so once I did that she says--she took the car and she said, "I'm still going to my mother."  I said, "What do you mean?"  She said, "I'm still going to my mother," and she took the kid and the clothes and she said, "I want you to take your so and so, blank back down south and plow mules, 'cause that's what you'll get.  You'll never be nobody, you'll never be a goddamn nothing."  So, she left.  So I sit there, I sit there so and then so I called my mother [Lulla Baker Wilson] for the first time in my life and in turn to talk to her, but I didn't want to tell my mother what was wrong, and so she said, "What's wrong, you don't want to tell me what's wrong?"  She said, "Y'all kids ought to get back in church," and I said, "Well, yeah, yeah."  So but after I hung up the phone I was depressed and I stayed depressed for a while but I wouldn't let it get me down, 'cause the next day I had eighteen jobs offered to me and took the one on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], but I wouldn't let it get me down, even though the spirit was broken you know I, I guess if you had a scale from a one to ten I probably was a 1.5, 1.5 at that time, 'cause I had lost my job, had worked five years without one day off, nothing less than sixteen, eighteen hour days, Christmas, Thanksgiving that whole nine yards.  All right then I go home I lose my wife and the kid, the whole nine yards, then I buy a car, then I wreck all my credit and everything.  So it, it was tough time, and so then I had to think about the fact where I had come from with my life because I left home to get my parents from down south, that was my only motive.  Not to make it for myself, but to get the parents from down south so they can be able to make a decent living before, before they leave the world, all right.  So I, I failed in all that, all that stuff at that particular time.  So as I failed from all that stuff in that particular time I said, "Well, where do I go now Lord, where do I go?  Where do I go?"  So we got the job offer and went to work at another McDonald's and worked five years there and then when we got in that situation I asked--got through the thing with Ray Kroc and stuff like that but at that period of time I, it just pushed me back into church and I was singing with a group, the Norfleet Brothers and so I got busy singing gospel music.  We went to rehearsal every Tuesday and Thursday night and sang on weekends.  So I stayed busy singing with them and I stayed busy being in church.  I went to prayer meeting on a Wednesday night and Tuesday night rehearsal, Thursday night rehearsal on weekends singing in church trying to find myself because there was nothing there for me to cling or go to or somebody I know that I could talk to get it done and then I came to the conclusion that okay I've had some things and like when I got into the McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation], we used to go out to Las Vegas [Nevada] and money and got my parents some of this and that and then eventually down through the years I realized that hey the thing I was missing was Christ in my life, because once I did that and once I got it in my mind and started working hard and do--doing that way that, then I found out this is the answer.  I'm, I'm gonna witness to it.
Story_ID: 613150
Speaker 1: Sir, when did you start singing with the Norfleet Brothers, about what year was that?
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974], '74 [1974], probably '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay, now you said you use to rehearse with them but they wouldn't let you sing with them?
Speaker 2: Right, right--we would, the Norfleet Brothers have been together I don't how long.  They, they were expert at prose.
Speaker 1: Are they really brothers?
Speaker 2: Three of 'em were, that when I came along, the other one had passed on, passed away, but the three brothers all of 'em passed away now, all of 'em gone.  The last one died about two months ago, but I, I--were traveling for five years, rehearsed at two nights a week, on weekends we'd be singing somewhere, but I couldn't sing, they wouldn't allow me to sing with them because they felt that I couldn't be able to get it, so after five years they finally called me up one day to sing, and I went up there and we sung and that one song and then after we got to singing I ended up with later on, I ended up with---and I sang with the Norfleet Brothers thirteen years and after thirteen years, five of those years I couldn't sing at all with them, so we finally got my television show 'Singsation' and I, I got 'Singsation' then I tried to promote the Norfleet Brothers on, on my TV show.
Story_ID: 613151
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now where did you get the idea for 'Singsation'?  Now did you do that while you were still at Mc- with McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, yep Mc- 'Singsation' was 19 and '89 [1989].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're still with McDonald's and, and now what was--what was it your interaction with the Norfleet Brothers that gave you the idea to do 'Singsation'?
Speaker 2: Well, they mentioned they'd like to have a TV show but they didn't have any money to do anything with.  I, I just said that if nobody would let me sing in, in the group because what happened was that, that we, we wa- go out to Chicago Gospel Fest [Chicago Gospel Music Festival] and I got to show 'Singsation' trying to put it on.  I hired the first producer and then the producer who got, I had $650,000. I lost it all and the producer spent it, got me in all these union situations and then the night of the first show we're trying to tape, she said that, "Well I got--I want these choir to go on."  I said well, "No, I want these quartets, the Norfleet Brothers and some other people going on too," and she said, "If you don't, if I don't put my choir on I'm gone quit and walk out."  I said, "Then you know what, you need to leave, go ahead," you know.  So she left and I left to produce the whole show myself and I got done trying to wrap it up, I find myself I had to borrow $250,000. 'Cause I lost all of the $650,000. Whatever I had for (unclear), I lost it all you know.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of money to lose.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I lost everything I saved and, and so I had my McDonald's and I went to Jim Fletcher [James Fletcher] at South Shore Bank [ShoreBank, Chicago, Illinois], he's, he's dead and gone now but I said I need $200,000, and he said, "Wilson [HistoryMaker Willie L. Wilson], what do you know about TV?"  I said, "I don't know a thing Jim about TV but I need $200,000."  I said, "I'll pay it back."   I said, you know, "Take it out my McDonald's."  Jim said, "I must be crazy but that's okay, you go on just, just write a check," and I wrote a check and like I got out there in less than two years I got that money back, paid it off and everything else, but the thing that got me with, with 'Singsation' was that I had felt that I was wandering around in my life then 'cause I wasn't--I was committed in a way to, to church, Christ and other ways I was not committed, so my mind was saying that Lord have blessed me with all these things today.  Okay, I said, "I'm gone give enough back," so one day I went to church and I was going down to church to donate some money, and as I went into church and I sat down at Lucy Hall's church [Friendship Baptist Church] on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] and the choir said, "What shall I render," and sang the song, "What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefit towards me" [Psalm 116:12] and like it hit me like that and I said, "I got to get busy," and that 'Singsation' became born then but now more than that but, but I said that since people don't want to let me really sing out here I'm gone buy me, get me a TV show and I'm gone sing all I want, right.  That's how 'Singsation' became alive.
Speaker 1: Now who came up with the name 'Singsation'?
Speaker 2: There was a guy--first there was a 'Singsation,' it was called 'Celebrate' and the lady, and the lady tried to trick me into that.  I got out of that because she wanted me to pay for the name 'Celebrate' and I didn't know nothing about TV so people putting all kind of stuff on me and then finally with another guy that I knew said well let's just call it 'Singsation' and I said you know what, I said okay get rid of that name over there and let's just call--we'll call this 'Singsation.'
Speaker 1: Well who's the guy that you got with that you came up with that name?
Speaker 2: The guy's name Potter [James Potter], oh, what's his name, oh, last name Potter, P-O-T-T-E-R.  I can't think of his first name now, but he came up with the name and, and so but he had, he was supposed to have been a sales person and he was supposed to have been selling the show and turned around he couldn't sell it and he only had twelve spots and my--the show was costing me twenty-five, thirty thousand dollars a week and I only, I, I only was bringing in then like a thousand dollars, $1,200 a week.
Speaker 1: Now that's, you started out with WBBM, Channel 2 [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now that's prime TV time, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were on--what time a day were you on?
Speaker 2: It was seven a.m. in the morning.
Speaker 1: On Sunday mornings?
Speaker 2: On Sunday morning right, and [HistoryMaker] Johnathan Rodgers, an African American guy helped me got there and got started with it and.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's when Johnathan Rodgers was there, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we got started and Vickie Winans was my first host and after a while later on [HistoryMaker] Merri Dee told me, said, "Wilson [HistoryMaker Willie L. Wilson], why don't you host your own show?"  You know I said, "Well I guess I should because you know sometimes these peoples sometimes they busy and they can't get over here and I should be doing my own thing," and then when I had started hosting myself you know and doing it so and now 'Singsation' is twenty, twenty year going there.  We just got done taping last weekend matter of fact, you know.
Story_ID: 613152
Speaker 1: The show--eventually you've sold enough ads.  And who--
Speaker 2: I sold enough ads to pay for it and get myself together.  The reason we've, we've been so busy over at my company now I have, I have now I got get my company and pump back up on that side, but we'll get it up.
Speaker 1: Now do you--you showcase you know national people like Al Green, I know and--
Speaker 2: I've, I've, Al, but the average gospel singer out here, maybe not a 100 percent of them, but I say 98 percent of 'em I've had on 'Singsation,' whether you, you are popular or not popular.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: One thing about my producer he, he was having all these people on my show and all of 'em were national artists. "Hey man," I said, "what about the local guys that can't sing?"  And he said, "Well, they can't sing."  I said, "Well, look they gone sing on 'Singsation,'" you know.  I said, "You put a national artist on there, you put the local artists, you, you put somebody that can't sing.  If they wanna sing and they can't sing, you put 'em on the show."
Speaker 1: But Chicago [Illinois] is a--you know you; you well know is talent rich like a lot of places.  There are lots of people that can sing that.
Speaker 2: Yes it is, but you know, know.
Speaker 1: Did you hold auditions for, for people at all?
Speaker 2: No, you ain't got to audition for me, that's, that's the good thing about 'Singsation,' you ain't got to audition for me, you can go on and sing, because I remember nobody would let me sing.
Speaker 1: Well how do you get on the show?  Suppose I wanted to sing on the show or what would I do?
Speaker 2: I'll let you sing, if I got, I (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just call you up and get a spot?
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you wanna sing I'll just have, I'll tell my producer to put 'em on, you know if you wanna serve the Lord by way of singing, if I got anything to do with it, you gone be able to serve the Lord by way of singing.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now did you have to pay like the big name acts like--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --like Luther Vandross and people like that?
Speaker 2: No, no, unh-uh, that's just the exposure they, they want you know 'cause mine's the first national show in the history of this country that is syndicated on network TV.  Now, [HistoryMaker] Bobby Jones has all cable, but mine's network TV like, like CBS you know or NBC, ABC (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 613153
Speaker 1: So how many markets are--is 'Singsation' broadcast in then?
Speaker 2: Well right now we're, we're doing, reaching about forty, sixty something, potential sixty something million homes per Sunday, all right but the market that we are in right now, we are about twenty-two markets, plus we're on, we're on WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois] around the fifty state and, and plus international.
Speaker 1: That's right the cable, WGN cable.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you most people can see it, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah everybody, all right yeah.
Speaker 1: Everybody can see it that's right, yeah I can even see it in Ohio yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I mean it's, it's yeah we be down in the Bahamas and you can cut it on in there (laughter), you know.  I mean I'll be over in, I'll be over in London [England] or Bermuda and people recognize me there.
Story_ID: 613154
Speaker 1: How much time does this take per, per week I mean out of your business time?
Speaker 2: I don't know because I, I do it in two days.  I bring about a hundred some group, tape 'em in two days and then we, we done with it.  You know we do the editing, editing the shows ['Singsation'] together and I do my intro and that's it.
Speaker 1: So you bring a hundred and something groups in?
Speaker 2: One hundred twenty-five, 100, 150 groups.
Speaker 1: In one day?
Speaker 2: One weekend.
Speaker 1: In one weekend?
Speaker 2: Um-hm on Saturday and Sunday.
Speaker 1: And tape them all and then you, and then you pull together the shows from?
Speaker 2: Twenty-six shows, and repeat one time, right.  I did each show economic wise to do it and, and my time you know.
Speaker 1: I never realized it could be done, well I guess it can.
Speaker 2: Aw, it ain't never been done. I'm the only person in history ever done that (laughter).  I taught TV how to do, do things, you know?
Speaker 1: So you know McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] is fast foods but you got like fast shows.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah we go in there.  They do what A and B select, the next one come on you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's, that's something, that's really something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the way we do it.
Story_ID: 613155
Speaker 1: So 'Singsation' is, is alive and healthy now that's gonna--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you plan to continue it as long as you can?
Speaker 2: As long as I live, if the Lord gives me the means to do it yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a wish, it's a service you know, and if I don't ever make any money off it anymore, as long as the Lord finds me--to do it another way I'll do it because it's, it's gospel music.  I mean a lot of people call me and say that they're in the bed and they can't get out the hospital or home, but that show is, is what motivate them and one person came into me one time, I'll never forget it.  He had saw 'Singsation,' he wanted to come and see me and they brought him in there and he saw me and he got baptized the very next Sunday, you know, and people call me and ask me to do my autograph and they said they'll pay 'em.  One lady said, "Well you know I got cancer. I can't talk but I saw your show. Can you send me one of your, your CDs [compact disc] and I'll pay you back when I get out," and I said, "Pay me back a penny once every hundred years," and I signed and sent it to her.  So that joy out of a that I get you know and, and so well I keep it on to help save souls and whatever way I can do in some small special way, and that's why I do that show.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a form of worship and trying to bring people to Christ.  I'm not a preacher but if I can--I'm a servant.  If I can sing a song or say a word or help somebody come out of their burden and lift it up, then I've done my part.
Story_ID: 613156
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now let me ask you about some of your other business ventures.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now you've got, you're doing a hospital supply?
Speaker 2: Medical supply company.
Speaker 1: Medical supply, I'm sorry (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, uh-huh. We do medical supplies and disposable product.
Speaker 1: That's Omar, Inc. [Omar Medical Supplies, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That one named after my son [Omar Wilson] that got, got killed.
Speaker 1: Tell us about what happened to him?
Speaker 2: Drug related, head of the gang and came in the house and you know my other kid was in there too and shot him right behind the ear and killed him in front of the other kid, and they caught the guy you know, and I, I guess that if you look at life the baddest hurt that I've ever had in my life was losing a twenty year old kid.  There ain't, there ain't nothing that you can ever do to describe that.  You know if you're human you can lose a spouse, a mother, or father, but you lose your kid ain't nothing, can't even nothing remotely hurt you as bad.  You'd rather take a beating for, for a hundred days; can't nothing ever hurt you that bad you know.  So we lost him and the gang related stuff, drugs I told him when I got him out of jail--I didn't want to get him out of jail and I told my ex-wife I said, "You know y'all bother me about getting him outta jail."  Here you got people who get on you, "You got the money, you can get him out," you know, "You got the money you can get him out."  I said, "Yeah, I'm not denying that," I said, "but the kid get out and he in trouble," (laughter), "they get out he gone get killed in less than six months or eight months," I said, "eight months."  I said, "He gone get killed in less than eight months, you know."  And true enough and then he calls me and he's hollering on the phone in jail in Cook County [Cook County Department of Corrections, Chicago, Illinois], he said, "Daddy please get me out, please get me out," and I, I gave in and called up my attorney friend and told him, "Get him out," and had him out the next day.  I told him, "Go get a haircut, and come on out and work at McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation]."  He went down to my barber and didn't want to act right, and then in eight months, less than four months later he was dead.  Yeah and I look at my ex-wife, and I look at her and I say, "You're crazy," you know.  I said, but, and I told her I said, "You know what? Had've left him in there like I said, he'd've been alive probably he could, could have stayed in there a little bit longer and serve his time and got a little older and probably would've you know not of been out there," you know but I said, "Y'all was the one, 'Get him out. You ain't no good.  What kind of father you are?'"  You know so life you know and so we got through that and so Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] at my son's funeral must've sent about oh boy, I mean he must've sent about a hundred bodyguards to my house and at the church.  Gangs were everywhere.  They were threatening to kill me if I had of said that he was part of the gang, and I got up there and I spoke and I said, "This just don't make sense, you know, make sense," and they almost turned the casket over in church.
Speaker 1: The gangs did?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah it was some gang members out there.
Speaker 1: They came into in the church and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yep, police officers all outside, every--I guess every (unclear) village out here was there, but the thing about Minister Farrakhan, a good friend of mine, a personal friend of mine and had the Muslim brothers and sisters there and as they tried to get behind me and my wife now, present wife here, the Muslims sat about five or six seats, blocked all the seats, kept 'em from getting behind me, and I sat in the middle and as I went up on their stage to talk, the pulpit to talk they stood up and blocked everybody from coming towards me and then we would drive to the cemetery, they would drive on one side of the street to keep somebody from pulling up beside me and everything like that so, and the police officers stayed behind.  We got to the cemetery they blocked everybody out from around my son's grave and until we got back home.
Story_ID: 613157
Speaker 1: I appreciate Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], he--today for that.  That's why when The Wall Street Journal put me on the front page and they said, "What do you (unclear) Minister Farrakhan," I said, "Mr. Farrakhan is a friend of mine, always will be, doesn't matter what anybody say about him, he will be Willie Wilson's [HistoryMaker Willie L. Wilson] friend," you know.  I said, "I don't agree with everything he say or do but I, I'm not gone ever deny him.  He's a human being making mistakes like everybody else make mistakes and I do too," and I said, "And you do too."  You know so I said, "So we ought to learn, we're all human beings and support one another you know, and, and I said I'm not--who am I to judge," you know, and I said, "that's bottom line to it you know."  And I asked Minister Farrakhan one time, "Man why you talk about white people so bad sometimes and things?"  He said, "Wilson," he said, "look somebody gotta offset the balance of these kids.  White man tell a, tell a black kid that they over here and y'all be doing this and that and looking at them, but somebody gotta expose the white man for what he really for."  I said, "I understand," you know.  So those things that you, you learn in life not to be 'suaded and, and but, but my whole thing I, I give it to--now I've never been in jail.  I've never did drugs, alcohol, never have, never have.  I've lived a clean life you know pretty much so, except for females here and there, you know, but, and I'm grateful to god that he kept me balanced.  My life been focus on just helping people, and it still is today.
Story_ID: 613158
Speaker 1: So, when I started this, came through that period of time--anyway I--you was asking about my company so I named the company Omar, Inc. [Omar Medical Supplies, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  I name all my companies after my kids.  When I had the McDonald's each one of them had a name.  You know, Omar [Omar Wilson] doing business at McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation], you know.  Terrell [Terrell Wilson] doing business at McDonald's, so it's Omar here.  So this company here we started it and what happened is that today we in this building here and we sell it to be people like of course McDonald's, we sell to 77.5 percent of the all the gloves, the garbage can liners, those are ours and McDonald's, and that's over about a thirteen thousand McDonald's.  We, we service McDonald's outta here, 100 percent all the McDonald's in Europe, with disposable gloves, we do that.  We serve like all the Red Lobster, Olive Gardens, (unclear), Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.], you know Costco [Costco Wholesale Corporation], you know, Kohl's Department Stores [Kohl's Department Stores, Inc.] and on and on and on, you know.  Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell [Taco Bell Corporation], all the Pizza Hut, and, and so we, we with that free company, and we does, we does in there in the hundreds of millions of sales a year.
Speaker 2: So that's primarily distribution of these products--of--
Speaker 1: Distribution.
Speaker 2: --of that kind of product to the restaurant industry and the medical industry?
Speaker 1: Right, we do it with hospitals and things like that too, we do wheel chair, (unclear), and stuff like that, gauze, masks and stuff like that and, and we got a office, we got an office in Shanghai, China and we've got an office Beijing, China and yesterday we just closed a deal on a factory in Mongolia, China.  In, in the next thirty days the Lord willing we'll have a factory opened up in thirty-six states.  We'll probably, we go into manufacturing, we'll have a factory, probably in Tijuana, Mexico and also down in Tennessee, yeah.  So we'll probably have those and so we work to take care of our outside my family and church, take to my employees then the churches and everything and tide first, and then we do that and the we'll continue to drive.  Now I probably don't have to work no more if I didn't want to, but I work harder than anybody in my organization.  I work like I ain't got one penny, you know because there's so many, so many needs out there to help people you know and I'm up working all the time you know like tonight I got a conference call for that China for eight p.m. tonight you know, and so we're trying to capture this new plant we're building over there.  I've got 29 percent interest in it and worked out an arrangement that any place in the world that buy products from the particular plant, I get 29 percent of the sale because we started out with these guys and doing the business with them the first time and doing it you know so we done that there and, and so we, we've been blessed and the, the focus of my life now is, and it has been a while, is that what can you do more to make myself more of a better of, of a Christian and faith, because that is the only key to it and I don't know for some people it's alcohol, for some people it's drugs, some people it's women that can free their mind.  For me, it's Jesus Christ, and I don't want nothing else you know.  That, that's me.  I always tell people this: "If you think about your spouse, your kid and anybody else all day and worry about this and that, if you're not worried more about Jesus Christ than that, something is wrong; you're missing it you know." I mean how many people like, some people be at home day and night worrying about their kids (laughter), you know worrying about their husband or spouse whatever it may be all right, but they don't never worry about that they done the weekday about Jesus Christ, what's gone happen to your soul you know?  And if the first thing is about is that if you focus more on Christ you'll add up all those other things, right to you.  He'll bring them part of your life and then if Christ don't want you, I sure don't want you, you know.  If, if, if you--if he can't do nothing with you, I sure can't do nothing with you, you know.  So those are my philosophies and the Bible say, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God" [Matthew 6:33] and all that ain't bad to you and trust me it's just that simple, you know.  I've gotten and I'm the day I'm about 99 percent happy today and I get the other 1 percent, you know you lose somebody in your family or if something like that up and down but, I don't, I don't--I'm much happier because you know what it's focus about help.

Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  When you look back at everything that you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No, I get asked that all the time, bring me the same way when I was at--if you, you read my book, the title of my book is 'What Shall I Do Next When I Don't Know Next What to Do' [ph.] all right?  I've been those error--if you're reading that book whereas I use to date this young lady and we used to stay together and, and she messed up with me with going to bed with this married man, three times I forgave her, three times.  And we were in love, I mean I was in blind love, but I was going through that transition of trying to get become a Christian also.  The Bible say you have to forgive to forget, and I had--if I found out three months later I wouldn't of been in that mode and I was forced to have to accept, trying to be a Christian person or to go back and just dump her out you know and I, I forgave her three times and so people ask me they say, "Well how in the heck you do this Wilson [HistoryMaker Willie L. Wilson]?"  I said, "I did it for the kingdom of God," I said, "but you know what the funny thing about it is? God asked me, 'Wilson, which way do you want to go this time if you had a choice?'  I said, 'Bring me the same way Jesus,'" the same way, because I would not be humble enough to forgive and try to help.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Same way.
Story_ID: 613160
Speaker 1: Now likewise when you look back over everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it I think that a legacy that I'd try to--that I would hope that to have is that my commitment to people and trying to bring their souls to Christ and we do that in my opinion, at least that's my opinion is, is trying to help people with they personal problems, financially you know, saying kind word or, "You can make it," you know.  Don't let nobody break you down, you know, or I tell them like my slogan, I say that, "Out of all the things in life that I've done, still it is, it is I that gain the most," and I say, "Never worry about anything about tomorrow" because last year until I came through prostate cancer, right and we made it through and didn't even have to take chemo [chemotherapy] all right?  When I laid down on that table I said, "Lord," I said, "whatever I've done left undone," you know and I was happy and, and so I said, "Well I'm not gone worry about it, I'm not gone ask you to bring me outta this thing but if you bring me out I got more work to do."  That was a year and a half to go.  And I tell 'em if Jesus Christ is, is already until tomorrow and that's my little sign I always keep over there in front of me you know and I know he's already into tomorrow because that's why I ain't got to worry about nothing, but the legacy would be that, that if tried to help somebody and some people and, and, in some small special way you know because I've truly given my heart, made mistakes yes, you know get mad sometimes yes, you know, but I mean genuine I am truly genuine, a person that care and work hard to help and, and still work today hard when I leave the house.  Last week we got another piece of business like I don't know I think it's somewhere where we'll be worth about $20 million all right in, in sales.  The first thing I thought about boy I got to be busier, how many more churches and people am I able to help?  You know so, that would be like I'm trying to help, and I reach back at my--well one of my kids young kids Terrell [Terrell Wilson], thirty years old and I'm teaching him, I'm pretty tough on him I make him go to China by hisself.  How you're doing book, how to run this business, how to learn it 'cause I don't want him to come up and say he got a business.  He got a generation that he need to try to take care of in legacy to what I'm doing with the vision I got to make it try to help somebody get through college, or help somebody that is married that they can keep their family together financially, that you can, you ain't got to make six, seven hours, eight dollars per hour or you can make fifty or a hundred thousand dollars a year you, you have an obligation to do that you know and I impress on him you know.  If I speak in church he goes with me, and then I, I tell him that.  I always say in church, I said in the church while you sitting, "I would hope that when I leave this earth and we still got the business, that my son sitting right here will continue to follow the legacy," it's about helping you know and then that, that's what I try to instill. That's what I think that I would like to be well left behind.  I don't, you know I think that the bottom line is people will say things good about you today.  I don't pay no mind to that because those are the same people that gone be they'll try to tie you down you know.  I put mine way beyond that you know and people compliment you, they say good things about you, do they good things, you don't pay no mind to that mess, you know.  'Cause I'll guarantee you they the same people trying to go to bed with your wife, same people.

Speaker 1: Now you're married again right, you've been?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Married again.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah my wife today is been married also.  We got a good relationship, I would like to think so.  We both go to church, go to the same church.  We--do we have up and downs sometimes?  Yes.  You know, do we--one thing we do and we understand Christ and we understand that hey there ain't no confusion in Christ.  So if one of us (unclear) something is going wrong, all right?  And, and so it's a, it's a good marriage you know.  I appreciate her and I think more and more is that you know when you get cancer, and anybody know anything got to do with cancer and how tough time it is to go through that, and, and you'll say to yourself, "Look, you got cancer, you get sick, spouses, relatives, cousins, and whoever it is.  Most people forsake you, you can be okay for a while all right, but you lay up in that hospital and, and you'll see people come up there and maybe see you the first day or two weeks or one week.  After a while you don't see them again 'til two or three months, then you don't see 'em at all okay, or they don't call or they don't come around okay," and, and I told my wife I said, "Well you know I, I we got a good relationship," but I said, "look, I, whatever you may want to do all," I said, "all I can say is that look, we'll make it. Don't let me hold you up. If you got to do something or do some things, take care of some things, fine," I said.  I said, "We had this cancer thing and we'll deal with it," and everything and she said, "Well no, I'm here for better or worse you know," and, and I appreciate her saying that you know, and even though I got Jesus, and I'm confident inside my mind, body, and soul okay?  And ain't nothing gone ever divide me or separate me from that all right, and but the thing of it is that she said it and she was there and she's still there, nice lady, and I couldn't ask for a better person.
