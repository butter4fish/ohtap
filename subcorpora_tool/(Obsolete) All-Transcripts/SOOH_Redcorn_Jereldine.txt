 Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Thursday, January  23, 2013, and I   m interviewing Jereldine Redcorn as part of the  Oklahoma Native Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Jeri  and Charles    home in Norman. Jeri, you   re Potawatomi and Caddo. You  spent much of your life as an educator, but in 1991 you started making  Caddo pottery. Since then, you   ve been a Rockefeller fellow, a  community scholar with the Smithsonian, and one of your pots was  chosen by First Lady Michelle Obama to reside in the White House.  Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today.  You   re welcome. Happy to do it.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at the Indian hospital. I grew  up mostly in Colony, Oklahoma, on Caddo land, my grandmother   s  allotment, a farm. That   s what we did. My father was a farmer, and so  we helped with the farming and the animals.  So you were close to your   is this your mom   s?  This is my father   s allotment. He   s Caddo. When we were young and we  were working in the fields, like chopping cotton or pulling cotton, we  would find a lot of arrowheads and a lot of artifacts and pieces of  pottery. Some were pretty big, so we just kind of wondered,    Wow,  these things are pretty old, and we   re seeing them,    beyond that, not  really thinking about pottery.  Right, that   s amazing. What was your relationship with your  grandparents on your dad   s side?  5  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  I didn   t know them. They had passed away before I was born, so I did  not know them. That   s, to me, a real loss because I can see my grandson  growing up and absolutely loving it, and I hope he realizes how great it  is for him to know Charles and myself.  How about on your mom   s side? Did you have grandparents on that  side?  I did. My grandfather passed away before I was born, I think sometime  in the 1930s, and my grandmother lived away from us. She lived in  Pawhuska, Oklahoma, so I didn   t see her except on very rare occasions.  Usually a funeral or sometimes we would visit, but not that often  because it was about 200 miles away. That was before interstate, so it  was a long trip, and with eight children in a car that you hoped didn   t  break down, it was really an undertaking.  So you   re growing up on a farm. What are your first memories of seeing  art? Maybe it was early.  You know, it probably was because we would find stones that had been  used, (we   d find grinding stones) but on the pottery, you could see  appliques, and you would see different marks. Basically I think, except  for songs, dances, art was in clothing. Art was in the dances that we  went to and in the shawls that we   d see and the beadwork.  I have an aunt; she   s a Cheyenne. I would go to her house, and I watch  her bead. The things she turned out, the purses, the moccasins, all the  other artifacts, articles that she was making was what I saw. To me, that  was art. Since we were such a small school, we didn   t really have the  opportunity   there wasn   t a museum in town. We didn   t really, you  know, take trips except for sometimes we   d go to the state capitol and  we   d go to the historical museum and see the murals by the Kiowa Five  and others like Archie Blackowl and  Monroe  Tsatoke. In that, I  thought they were just amazing to me because I knew some of them.  They were rather old, you know, and I guess I   m older now and I can  think about how old I thought these people were. They were doing these  things in the   30s, so most of them were still all alive when I was, I  guess, in high school.  Where did you encounter some of the older artists whose work you   .  Well, my father went to school, St. Patrick   s Catholic  Mission  School  in Anadarko. He was good friends with   trying to think of his name  now, Vanessa   s grandfather. Can   t remember. They were very good  friends, so he would invite us to a lot of their dances. At that time, I  really didn   t know that what he was doing was significant. He didn   t  6  Little Thunder  Redcorn  actually show his paintings or anything like that to us. Every once in a  while, he would have a dance at his place, really, I guess, at Fort Cobb.  That was always interesting. Then the Tsatokes were from Carnegie.  Colony and Carnegie were very close together, maybe fifteen miles  apart. I knew a lot of the children of the Kiowa artists but not really  thinking about them as artists.  I don   t think I really had an exposure to art other than nature and the  beadwork and shawls and buckskin dresses or dush-tohs, so that was my  artistic world. I wasn   t exposed exactly to, I would say, the art of opera  or anything like that, but we   d listen on radio and had our favorites. One  of the things that I thought was really cool was learning Caddo dances. I  didn   t learn the songs until much later, but when I was young they were  really a lot of fun.  So you were able to travel down that way and participate in the dances  your dad did each summer.  Well, yes, every summer. Our allotment was a Caddo allotment, but it  was on the edge of the Cheyenne Arapaho reservation in Colony. On  that reservation, there were, I assume, WPA houses and barns. They  were pine on the inside, knotty pine on the inside, with wooden roofs,  shake roofs. The barns were really big. The thing about it is, is that we  fit in because Caddos were farmers. I mean, we fit in with that scene, but  the Cheyennes did not. Farming was something, I think, that they put  aside when they found the plains and buffalo.  We had cows, and we had pigs. For a time, we lived in a couple of those  houses that were on the reservation. The reason was my father had come  home from the war in 1944, and when he was discharged from the  Army, World War II, when he came home, our family house had been  rented to somebody else. For a year there, we kept our contract with  them, and we lived in some of the Indian houses, some of the Cheyenne  houses and Arapaho houses, that they had put on the reservation.  It is kind of interesting because our neighbors were Cheyennes or  Arapaho. Just north of us was Ike Rhodes, and he was a Cheyenne. He  sang around the drum. He was one of our singers. I say    our    singers,  but anyway, one of the singers that Colony produced. Then just beyond  that was the Manns, Henrietta Mann, who married a white man. Her  name was Henrietta Whiteman, later. I knew her when she was a young  girl. We went to school with the Cheyenne and Arapahos, and because  we did, a lot of the customs   I know that the Cheyennes had buckskin  dresses, whereas the Caddos wore different clothes, and their songs were  different.  7  Every Saturday night in the wintertime, we would gather at the  Cheyenne Arapaho community building. It was a really nice building  with a potbellied stove. The men would get there and start the fire early.  Then the singers would come and warm the drum. Generally we had two  singers, Ike Rhodes and an Arapaho. If I remember his name I will get it.  (Laughter) Jasper Reynolds, that   s it. He was one of our neighbors, too,  on the reservation. They were spaced about maybe an eighth of a mile  apart, each one having a barn and a pump.  I just thought all reservations were like that. I found out later, not  everyone had those houses. I think it was interesting. There was a  boarding school there out on the reservation. It was called Seger Indian  School. They basically called the town Seger Colony and later changed  to Colony. That   s where I went to school, but that   s where my father  went to boarding school. There were a few Caddos that went there but  mostly Arapaho and some Cheyennes. I think many of the Cheyennes  went to Concho. Later on, the Cheyenne Arapaho tribes let the town use  that as their school.  I assume they rented the buildings. It was two stories, and then it had a  very spacious attic. I just thought all schools were like that. It was really  cool. I thought it was. Most of the kids there that I went to school with     I started first grade there. We moved there when I was four years old.  We moved from Mesilla Park, which was close to Fort Bliss. That   s  where my father was stationed, so we moved to Mesilla Park to be near  him, and then we moved to Colony. That was when I was about four  years old, so I started school there, and I finished school there. Basically,  I guess, that   s my hometown.  We were about thirteen miles away from where most of the Caddos  were, which is in Binger, so we went to dances in Binger, Caddo dances,  which were different, very, very different. Then we   d go to Carnegie to  go to their dances, and then we   d have dances at Colony, Colony  Powwow. We   d go to Weatherford or Clinton for other dances, so I  knew a lot of different tribes. I knew their customs, how they did things  different, you know.  I didn   t know too many Comanches, but my father did because he had  gone to Haskell Indian School way back in the    20s. He knew some of  the Comanches, and we would see them at the Anadarko fair every year.  I   m saying that because my view of the world was of a lot of tribes with  different customs. Of course, what I loved best were the Caddo dances.  They were not done generally during the evening. It was just like all-night  dancing, all night dancing and singing. Whereas, like if you go to  Carnegie, the dance would be over at ten, eleven, and people would go  home, but the Caddo people, they just danced all night.  8  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Those are wonderful influences. What is your first memory of making  art?  My first memory of making art was at school. I would never have art,  but one of our teachers was an artist and an art teacher, so for maybe  about three years, there was art at Colony. I think I was a freshman, and  they just combined all the grades. We weren   t a big school. I   m sure  there were fifty or sixty in the whole high school, (Laughter) so it was  pretty small.  I had this opportunity to learn to draw and to learn lettering, make  posters. I tried pretty hard, but I could just could see, I felt like I didn   t  have the talent. What   s interesting about this is the Cheyenne Arapaho  Indians who went to school there, they loved that class, probably as  much as they disliked all the other parts of it and all of the other  discipline parts of it. They loved that class, and they loved the art  teacher. That was like the first time I saw those young boys really relate  to a teacher or someone who was not Indian.  I think the first white person I ever really knew was my first grade  teacher. It was interesting. As much as I can talk now, I wasn   t that way.  I know there was just something that I just didn   t relate to them,  although I liked her. I liked my first grade teacher, but at the same time I  would see some other kids who were just comfortable at talking to them.  It was just like,    This is different.    (Laughter) That really was the first  time I ever connected with art. I was good in math. I was good in math  and English, so I majored in math in college, and I minored in English.  Those two things, I think, fit very well into art, but I didn   t take an art  course. I wish I would have now. (Laughter)  I   m glad you said that because I do have a question about the fit. That   s  wonderful and unusual, number one, to be majoring in math, to have a  mathematical and to be good at it and be encouraged. I was wondering  how you got to Wayland University. Is that where you went to college?  I went to college at Wayland. I was just talking about this the other night  at our language class, Caddo language. I was valedictorian of our class.  There was not any teacher or the superintendent or principal who said,     Jeri, I believe you should go to college. I   ll look for a scholarship for  you.    It was just assumed that it was not for Indians. Otherwise, why  would they not have encouraged someone who was, I think, as bright as  myself, you know? (Laughter)  The way I got to go was, there was a preacher. His name was Steven  Gover, and he   s Pawnee. He was in Weatherford, and every once in a  9  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  while he would come to our church. He invited me to go with him to  Falls Creek, and I spent a week down there. That was a lot of fun.  Before I graduated, he came to me and said,    I think you could get a  basketball scholarship.     At that time, I had never heard of Wayland College, (Wayland Baptist  College is what it was then) but he did know. He said,    I   m going to take  you down. They   re having basketball tryouts. It   s at Plainview, Texas.     So he drove me down there, and I stayed in the dorm, and I tried out. I  received an academic scholarship, and then later I received a basketball,  I guess, work-study program. I was the secretary to the coach, and he  didn   t really have anything for me to do. (Laughs)  (Laughter) So he didn   t really play you that much.  No, no he didn   t, so I would study, and I would do things. At that time,  there were only two colleges in the United States that had women   s  basketball teams. One was Wayland Baptist University, and the other  one was Iowa State. Nashville Business College had one, but theirs was  more like a club team in that when you graduated, if you were working  for them, you could play. I know it probably sounds   OU didn   t have a  women   s team. Moore didn   t have one. Anadarko didn   t. Pawhuska  didn   t. Tulsa   all of the big schools, but the little ones had basketball.  I really truly enjoyed playing basketball and then getting the opportunity  to actually go to college. So, really, that   s how I did it because my  parents really didn   t know how   I think they went to the education  director in Anadarko agency and said,    Do you have any scholarships  for my daughter who is the valedictorian?    And he would say,    No, we  didn   t.    I found out later that they did, but they would push them to     anyway, although I didn   t know about it, that was my first knowledge of  like, favoritism. (Laughs) They don   t do that now.  I didn   t get a BIA  Bureau of Indian Affairs  scholarship until I was  married. Then later they changed the programs, and so more people had  knowledge of these programs. Then my oldest sister was valedictorian.  They didn   t have any money for her. She did go to Haskell and got a  really good education there. My next sister, the second oldest, was  valedictorian, and they had no money for her. My third sister, the same  thing, and for me, they had no money. I was fortunate, I guess, that  Steven Gover took an interest in me. Otherwise, I probably would not  have gone on to get a degree, but I would have gone to secretary school.  And we needed you in Indian education. (Laughter) What did you do  when you got out of school? Did you meet your husband at that point?  10  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  I did. I went to the University of Oklahoma. I got a scholarship for math,  but when I got there I really didn   t have the interest. I really wanted to  write, or I was interested in English, and so I switched over to English. I  did meet Charles. I think we met at OU, and he was not going to OU at  that time. He was taking, I guess, a semester off. He had already gone, I  think, the year before or two years before. I met his sister. We were  roommates, so she introduced me to him. We started going out, and then  we got married.  Still not really taking any art classes or anything.  Still not taking any art classes at all. But you know what? Charles     brother Jim Redcorn was a good artist. That   s when I started noticing art  or thinking about it. He would talk about colors, or he would talk subject  matter. I   d watch him sketch and see how he developed things. He had a  passion for art.  My daughter, she was a graphic artist, and she would say,    You can  work at being better.    That   s what she would say.    You need to take  care, and you need to do it just like you would do a garden and study and  all these things.    But I do think there   s talent in there and passion that  comes naturally. I would watch my grandson draw, and he was drawing  at three and four and five. He drew a lot of, like, Spider-Man or comics,  then he would develop his style through it. He was just young. One day I  said,    How do you draw this?    And he said,    I   m careful.    (Laughter)  He said,    I   m careful.     Then if he made a mistake or if he thought, he would look at what he  was doing, and he would erase it. I thought,    That   s what I didn   t have,     was the patience to be careful and then to enjoy the patience without  getting upset with what you   re doing. I know I   ve seen some movies  where you would see artists throw something across the room. I doubt it,  you know, because why would they throw paint? It costs a lot. Or why  tear up a canvas, because that costs a lot. (Laughter)  When did you decide to go on to graduate school?  I was teaching math at Riverside Indian School in Anadarko. There was  a program to go to Penn State, basically sponsored by the Bureau of  Indian Affairs, and so both Charles and I applied to go. I was working at  the time, so it was fairly easy because I was able to just continue  receiving my pay, and we went to Penn State. That was really a great  experience because it was about administrative education, but in college,  there was not Indian studies at that time. What I learned about Indian  history was like,    Yes, there were the Indians,    you know, that chapter  on Indians.    They were in the way of progress, so basically they were  11  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  put on reservations, and they really wanted it because we were actually  doing them a favor because now they can go to school and they can  become farmers,    and etcetera, etcetera.  You never really got history, the real history, so when we went to Penn  State, we were education in the form of what was happening on  reservations, what was happening across the nation in education. What  are some things that we could change? What are the actual legal aspects  of education? I think that was one of our courses, the legal aspects of  education.  When I graduated from Wayland, I was contacted by a group that had  set up an American Indian workshop in Boulder, Colorado. I was there  for six weeks with other, I think there were thirty Indians, and we stayed  in, I guess it was a fraternity house that was rented. The girls stayed on  the second floor and the men on the third. We had the living area in the  bottom and the dining area in the basement. It was a pretty neat setup.  But learning, being taught history and anthropology, and learning about  the legal things that were happening across the nation, we had some  people from the National Congress of the American Indian come and  give speeches. I think that was part of opening everybody   s eyes to the  fact that there is the history, and there were treaties, and there were good  things about Indian education that would be good for everybody and not  just Indian students.  It all comes into play throughout your life, doesn   t it? (Laughter) You  went on and taught geometry, I guess, in the Oklahoma public schools  for a while.  I did, yes.  I   m wondering, I know we haven   t gotten to your pottery yet, but does  anything from your math background work into your work with clay?  It does. It   s very helpful to know about angles or know proportions and  things like that. That is very helpful. I think getting over the fear of art,  the fear of drawing, that was major. (Laughter)  When did you get involved with the Caddo Culture Club? Are you and  your husband living in Oklahoma City at this point?  Yes, we were. It was probably 1990, maybe    91, I think. I   m trying     yes, that   s what it was, about 1990, I think. There was a man here in  Norman and there was another man in Oklahoma City that said,     They   re doing these classes down in Binger, and they   re practicing the  12  dances.    His name was Phil Newcomit, here. His wife was Caddo, but  he was so interested in   he was probably more Caddo than most Caddos  because he knew the dances and the language and the customs. When he  went down there, I would ride down there with him, and it was really  interesting. They had a Caddo dance once, and it was over about ten  o   clock. They said,    Why is the dance over?    It was because the only  singer who knew the songs was ill and he had to leave. They said,    You  know, this has got to change.    (Laughs) That was Wimpy Edmonds and  then his brother Randlett who knew the songs. There were, I think, a few  more people, Fred Parton.  People had moved away, like Randlett lived at Lawrence, Kansas,  because he had a job with Haskell Indian School, before it was Haskell  University, so he didn   t get back that much. He actually went to a lot of  powwows in Lawrence or over at Mayetta where the Potawatomi  reservation was or with the Kickapoos. Living up there, he didn   t have a  chance to sing with other Caddos.  That   s when I became involved. In 1991, I believe, the Texas  Archaeological Society was holding their, I guess they call it their  archaeological dig or archaeological project, and they were holding it on  the Red River on the Texas side. There were no places for them to stay,  so they crossed the Red River and stayed at the Holiday Inn, I think, in  Idabel.  They invited us to Idabel, the Culture Club, to dance and sing. We went  down there, and while we were there, we went to the  Museum of the  Red River . There had been a fabulous collection of Caddo pottery by  several people, but most of all by the owners of the Red River Museum.  They let us go in the back and look at them, and it was just astonishing. I  was thinking,    I can   t believe I   m seeing this, and I can   t believe that I  did not know about this.    It was kind of like a connection to my history  to realize that Caddos were there in Idabel (they were on the other side)  and that along where Idabel is, along the Red River, both sides, there  were little towns, Caddo towns all up and down the bend there.  Their amazing, prolific, and talented abilities in clay, just amazing, it  sparked something in me. I think first you can say,    Why wasn   t I taught  about this?    But none of us had. There was a man in his eighties, I think  late eighties, and he was just thinking,    You know, I didn   t know this.     Even though I had kind of an inkling of history like from the workshop,  and I had read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and all of these things,  it was kind of actually pan-Indians. You know?  Yet, when we went to Idabel, we started out with the Turkey Dance, and  we sang the Drum Dance, then we did the Fish Dance. These were  13  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  things that Randlett Edmonds and Wimpy Edmonds and the other  singers   I would say there were less than ten singers at that point that  gathered. When you go to powwows, they weren   t singing Caddo songs  any more than they were Creek Stomp Dances or all the other neat  songs. So we were dancing, and I think the next day this one man, (his  name was Dr. Jim Corbin from Stephen F. Austin  State  University) he  gave a ceramics lesson. He had clay, and each of us got a little bit of  clay, and he showed us how to mold it.  Was the ceramics lesson for anybody attending the conference, right? It  wasn   t targeted for Caddo people?  It was targeted for Caddo people.  Oh   The other archaeologists weren   t there, except the ones who were  interested. Well, I guess all of them, all of the archaeologists were  interested in Caddo life, pottery, customs, artifacts, but Jim Corbin had  been studying old ceramics traditions. He had some of his pots there,  and after we started working on this, he showed us a firing, and it was  just right on the ground. It was a little bit rainy, and some of them  popped and broke. He said,    You know, usually this doesn   t happen,     but it had to be the wet weather. It had to be other conditions. So what I  did, I took that knowledge, which wasn   t much     And it was your first experience working really with clay, wasn   t it?  It was the first experience, except when we were making clay dolls on  our creek on our farm, but that was my first experience. That   s not what  I did because what I was doing at that time in    91,    92, I was trying to  get a Caddo newspaper started, an independent one, focusing on  information. I kind of thought we could sell ads, and other people would  take up writing, but you know what? Things don   t happen that way.  (Laughter) I did have a couple of people who helped me mail, do the  mailing, and that was really important because we had to find the  addresses. I   m surprised they even let us have them then.  But then, there was nothing going on. I think there was bingo at the  Wichita Caddo Delaware Reservation, WCD Reservation, in Anadarko.  That   s where the Riverside Indian School was, so when we started the  paper, we sold them an ad. We did this, and I think we sold two or three  ads, and it paid for it. (Laughter) But that   s what I was doing. I wasn   t  doing clay until late 1994. I had gone through some things, and I was  trying to get my life back, and was I going to go back to teaching? I  thought,    While I   m doing this, I can at least encourage other women to  14  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  work with clay,    so I started making pots.  In association, kind of, with the Culture Club?  Well, just me. My idea was that I would get all these people to join in.  (Laughter) I started it, and I thought,    Well, I   m learning a little bit  more, and I   m learning a little bit more.    I didn   t realize there were  resources out there. I didn   t realize the University of Oklahoma had a  major collection and that they had books that you could actually look     Of Caddo pottery?  Of Caddo pottery, or, you know, the Red River Museum. I was really  just kind of like doing it, just trying to learn about it. I didn   t know what  clay. In fact, I was just using any clay. In fact, I think there was someone  at   oh, I   m trying to think where I got this clay. They said    Oh, it   s just  all the clay thrown together.    (Laughter) That   s what I was using.    We  don   t use this clay. It   s kind of extra.    They just mixed it up, and it was  for teaching or something like that.  What I did was, I invited Dr. Don Wyckoff   that was before the new  Seminole Museum was built. His office was on North Base  Avenue ,  kind of where the YMCA is now. They were collections   it was  horrible where they had the collections, but he invited me over, and we  looked at them. I took pictures. Then you didn   t have instant pictures,  either. You took a picture, you sent it off, and someone developed it.  (Laughter) The computers weren   t there where you could go online and  see things. I didn   t have books or anything like that.  Lois Albert was his assistant. They were very helpful in sharing that. I  invited them over for lunch and said,    Look what I   ve done.    Don said,     You need to go to Caddo Conference and show this. It   s going to be  next month, and it is in Austin.    Caddo Conference was not for Caddos,  I mean, okay, not that we weren   t welcome. It was not for Caddos. It  was for archaeologists who study Caddos. I think it   s going to be, like,  it   s coming up soon. It   s been over fifty years since that started.  When I went down there, I set up my table, which was just a table, ten  by four, something like that. All of the universities that now owned  Caddo homeland, which is, I call it the four-state area, it was Arkansas,  Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma, down in Idabel, down into Texas,  down in Louisiana in the swamps, and over to Arkansas. When I began  setting up, they were holding it in Austin this year, and it rotates from  state to state, like Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana. Each state  will host the Caddo Conference. This year, Oklahoma   s hosting it. It   s  going to be at Gilcrease  Museum  next month. (Laughs) When I set up,  15  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  the archaeologists would come by, and they were just fascinated with  what I was doing, and as crude as it was at that point, and they were  buying.  I had a table next to Hester Davis. She was the state archaeologist, Dr.  Hester Davis of Arkansas. At that time, Dr. Wyckoff was the state  archaeologist for Oklahoma. I got to know all these state archaeologists  well, and they   re my friends now. When the Caddo would go by, Caddo  people   we were there dancing. They invited us down, and I took my  things so I could dance. They just kind of bypassed it because it wasn   t  important at that point. Later on, I think it   s become very important. I  think at that time, there were no NAGPRA, Native American Graves  Protection and Repatriation Act. I don   t believe there was that.  That really, really gave me heart. When I came back here, there were  two ladies who asked me to show them how to make pottery because  they had gone down there, so I did. We were right here in my kitchen on  this counter and my table, and I   m showing them how to make pottery  the way Jim Corbin had been doing it. At that time, I didn   t realize there  were other things like temper, like shell temper and bone and this. I  didn   t know all of the intricacies. We were using clay that Jim Corbin  had used. In fact, I think he gave me some of the clay.  Other people would call me up, and they said,    Well, why can   t we  come?    I wasn   t charging anything. (Laughter) I said,    Well, you can,     so the next week, there were more. There were probably about fifteen  women here, right in this little area. The men were in the living room  watching. They were all so hungry for something Caddo, (Laughter) so  we moved it. One of the women   s sons had a warehouse that he wasn   t  using, and it had tables, and so we moved there. That was really a lot of  fun. I think someone even taped it.  So you were still learning, yourself...  I was learning.     but the ripple effect was spreading, and they were learning, too, in the  beginning.  They were learning. I kind of think it   s like a mission, like I was telling  you, if you have the passion. People have the passion, but there   s the  will, too. There is that,    All the mistakes,    and    What am I doing?    The  other thing is that I was thinking about, in that time period, of going  back to teaching, which I did. I was just so interested in this, and I  thought,    Well, I can do it on the weekends,    but I found out I couldn   t.  There   s an energy that you need, and then there   s also the time when  16  Little Thunder  Redcorn  you are making   you   re being peaceful, or you   re gathering yourself to  get ready to do something. I think you need that time, that down time.  It   s kind of precious when you think about it.  Did you and Charles both discuss,    I think I   m not going to go back to  teaching. I   m going to do this. Let   s see if we can do this.   ?  Yes, we did, but I ended up going back to teaching. I had formerly  taught here in Norman Public Schools, Whittier  Middle School . I think  I taught there a couple of years, and then I actually got involved with the  tribal council and helping out. I thought,    I can   t do that.    Charles was  working at the Indian Affairs Commission in Oklahoma City. It was  good that I would be able to stop and do something.  Then, in that period of time in the   80s I think I taught at Whittier, and  then I was a director at Red Earth for two years, and then I started this,  doing more with the Culture Club. I certainly was not in any way or  fashion the leader. I was just like, they   d tell me what to do, and I hoped  I could do it. (Laughter) But I was trying to learn the songs and listening  to some of them and just doing my very best.  When I went back to school, back to teaching, it was as a math teacher  in Oklahoma City at Capitol Hill, which is an inner-city school. With the  things that go along, I think it was probably 98 percent free lunches. The  gang problem, there was probably 50 percent Mexican. I   m saying they  were from Mexico. They were not Chicanos. They were not Hispanics.  They were Mexicans, and then there was probably 30 percent black, and  the rest of them Indian or white.  Talk about a calling, I think that that was, because I taught there for  seven or eight years. In that time, I really didn   t do pottery, and I think I  resigned in 2004. I mean, I retired. Then I was able to spend more time  here. I really value that experience. I value the people who worked there.  I taught algebra, geometry.  The University of Texas has an enormous  Caddo  collection. The  University of Oklahoma has an enormous collection. In Louisiana, in  their state museum they have a Caddo display. The University of  Arkansas, they also have. Not just University of Arkansas, but  Henderson  State University . All the other colleges do, too. Stephen F.  Austin University, they have it. I can visit them, and I have visited all of  those states. Natchitoches, Louisiana, they have a wonderful museum,  and I have some of my pieces there. I think the Corps of Engineers built  a visitors center, and they asked me to make some, so I did.  Then I have some actually in the museum. When the Art Institute of  17  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Chicago put together a show called Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand, one of  the things was they really wanted the Caddos    permission, and they went  around to different tribes, the Creeks and the Choctaws, Chickasaws, but  the Caddo collection in there was just amazing. I was the artist-in-residence  that actually went up there (I was one of the ones) and showed  my pottery and had discussion groups. That was an amazing experience.  The book that went with them, there was a lot of Caddo pottery.  When they did that show   there are people in the United States who  have collections of Caddo pottery but won   t come forward with them  because it   s probably against the law how they obtain them, but people  are still purchasing them, dealing on the black market. It   s one of the  things that I didn   t know. I didn   t know our pottery was treasured by so  many people.  How much of your work does involve replication pieces, and how much  is just you working?  I rarely do replications anymore. I will use a design. It   s probably hard  to do that, anyway, but I take a lot of liberties with the designs. I   ve  looked at some of their pieces, and, wow, I can   t believe the intricacies.  I   ll sketch it out, and then I   ll try to sketch it out again. I really try to  sketch faithfully what I see, so if I change it, I know what   s changed and  I know what I have left there.  There was a reference in one thing I read to Caddo clay. Do you dig  your own clay?  I don   t dig my own clay. Just about all that I do right now is a  commercial clay. I fire it outdoors. It   s wood fired. It   s kind of my own  method. I think that I   m going to leave that, digging the clay and mixing  with the shell, which I   ve done. I have a few pieces where I dug the clay,  and I have a lot of clay. I have some from the Red River, some from  Marshall, Texas, some from Natchitoches, and a lot from Alto, Texas, or  Nacogdoches. You know, it   s almost to see if you need to use the same  clay because if you don   t, then you are doing a lot of experimentation.  I did do that. I   ve got some shell that I   ve burned and then I   ve ground  up and mixed with clay. The other thing I   ve done is mix it with sand,  and I   ve experimented with bone and also grog. One reason I pretty  much use a commercial clay is because I can burnish it where I know  how it   s going to be, how it   s going to come out, so that   s kind of the  road I   m taking.  I know there   s probably other people who are going to do all that  experimentation. I know a lot of archaeologists have. I know that there  18  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  are some other people who are replicating Caddo pottery and selling it,  which is actually against the law if you do that. I know that some people  do, Southeastern artists, and they copy it because Caddos had an  amazing diversity of clays and designs. I don   t think any other  Southeastern groups had quite that tradition.  A lot of your pots are in brown tones, and I   m used to seeing, in  Southeastern, reds or blacks. Is that a Caddo characteristic, or is that  part of your special firing?  You know what? It   s part of the Caddo tradition, but it   s part of the way  it   s fired. Usually, I will put like a red slip on my pottery and then  burnish it. I enjoy doing that. That   s just how it fires. Some of it is really  black, and some of it is really kind of a brownish tone, which I like.  I think it   s beautiful, too.  But the Caddos did have red. They had buff, black, all sorts of brown. It  was kind of hard to get brown because the clay, sometimes it just  wouldn   t fire exactly the way you wanted it to, and that   s okay. There is  always some something, a spot     A surprise.     a surprise, yes.  Have you gotten the lightness that you so admire? Have you gotten that  feeling of lightness to your pots?  I have on most of them. That   s what I do now. That   s what I prefer  doing, is trying to make them thin without endangering the firing or  whatever. I do try to make them the same thickness all over except for  the bottom. That way, they fire better.  And they   re decorative. You haven   t done any that you intended to be  really functional.  Right. They are decorative.  I   ve noticed that Chase Earles is a Caddo potter that   s been displaying a  very contemporary-style pot. Did he attend any of your workshops?  No, he didn   t. He sent me an email. He said,    I   m a Caddo. I used to live  in Santa Fe, and I was making Pueblo pottery.    He was going to start  being a potter. He studied art, so he was familiar with clay, and he had  gone through the process. He called me up, and he said,    I don   t want to  19  Little Thunder  Redcorn  be out there copying them. I   m sure the Caddos have a pottery  tradition.    I said,    Yes.     He came up here, and I went through my process here. He had seen  Pueblo pottery fired, and I think he   d read some things. I shared with  him books and people. I said,    You know, in a couple of months we are  going to go   it   s Caddo Conference.    I introduced him to the  archaeologists. I said,    You need to come to this and learn about a lot of  the things they   re studying and the whole scope of where the Caddos  were.    He took off. He is really doing   and this is what I think I  probably tried, which I didn   t really have assistance in.  I think that now there   s people who have more of an idea of how much  you would use, shell to clay, those proportions. I know there was one  archaeologist in Arkansas that said he used 50 percent, and I would use  like 20 percent of shell that I thought that was just plenty good enough. I  don   t know, but I think that   s probably a research area. This is hard to  do, but I   ve come to the realization that I   m going to   there   s many  things that I want to do, but I   m going to do my art the way I do it  because it was hard to say that I was an artist, having not studied art and  being a community organizer. (Laughter)  I don   t know what your thoughts are, but there have been several Native  artist women who really found their art or their career later in life. I  know the practical reasons for that, because your kids are grown and  you   re not taking care of grandkids all the time, but do you think there   s  a value system that also supports that, a Native value system?  I think there is a value system, particularly in the Caddo tribe. Their line  is maternal. It goes through your mother. They were important in  passing on values to the children, and there   s always been that. In any of  the communities that I have observed, whether the line goes through  their fathers or whether through their mothers, there is a sense of order.  There is a sense of,    This is who you are.    I think that is comforting to  know that this is in place. You don   t have to wonder. You don   t have to  be chaotic.  The Caddo festival that I was mentioning is going to be the first  weekend in March, and it   s going to be at the Oklahoma History Center.  That   s a topic that we are talking about. Dee BigFoot, who is a Caddo  elder, and myself, and a few more people are going to talk about the  order and the harmony and the traditions that were passed down. There  was a certain way of doing things, and there may be variations, but this  is what you did.  When you have a meal, there are certain things that you do before you  20  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  partake of a meal. The values and traditions and the order help an  individual find that harmony of mind, body, and spirit, which is the title  of our festival. (Laughs) One of the things that we   re doing, (it   s a  festival) we   re talking about food, and the meal that we serve is going to  be buffalo and squash and pumpkin and beans. Those were our  traditions, and corn and nuts and berries.  We are connecting back to our roots and honoring the traditions,  particularly the farming traditions that the Caddos had. It was important.  We were very prolific about having gardens and farms and in working  together. I grew up with Cheyenne and Arapaho, and their dances were  like the War Dance. There were some like the Round Dance, and we  also did the Owl Dance.  The Caddo dances are probably more like Pueblo dances where we have  a leader, and sometimes there   s a caller. All of them are pretty much in  order, with the exception of   our Turkey Dance is probably the most  ceremonial of our dances. It is a victory dance. It has been called a scalp  dance, but the women dance it. The lead woman will hold a staff, and  those positions are handed down. They   re inherited. The women were  very, very important in these dances, in these songs, in the whole  community. They made decisions as much as the men.  Looking back on your pottery career so far, what   s been one of the  highlights?  Having a piece that was selected for the Oval Office. I think that is the  highlight of my career.  Were you at a booth at a show when it was selected?  No, I was not. In 2005, because Caddo pottery has been so overlooked,  and yet it was so prolific and important, when it was lost and when I  started bringing it back, the Smithsonian and archaeologists there really  appreciated what I was doing, especially the staff at the Smithsonian,  particularly those who were studying Southeastern United States tribes.  They were having a show. It was going to be in New York City. It was  going to be for the opening of the Heye Museum  George Gustav Heye  Center, National Museum of the American Indian . They contacted me  to be a part of that show, along with seven other artists. Most of the  show was of old pottery. I had a couple of pieces in there, but they  purchased them. When they purchased them, that became part of their  collection. When the Obamas were selecting the art, they chose one of  my pieces.  That   s wonderful. How about a low point in your pottery career?  21  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Let me think. I think it was realizing I didn   t make enough and I went  back to teaching. Now that I look back, that was really low for me  because I thought,    I think I can do this,    and it didn   t happen. So just  continuing   but once I began teaching, I really, truly enjoyed it, but it  was very hard, and at my age it was pretty difficult. I   ll put it that way.  But I really met some wonderful people, had wonderful students, and I  did my very, very best to do that.  I have one story. When the Oklahoma State Legislature passed the law,  setting higher standards, I was teaching. In our class in the Oklahoma  City school system, they said,    We are going to get the best teachers,  and the first thing they   re going to do is evaluate Algebra I.    I went from  teaching Algebra II and Geometry to teaching Algebra I. Those were my  classes.  I had one class that was called ESL, English as a Second Language. I  didn   t speak Spanish, although I   d had some Spanish courses, and they  didn   t speak English. These are freshmen. They learned. Every day, they  would put a problem on the whiteboard. One of the students, he wrote by  his name,    so and so,    and then he   d put,    Guadalajara.    So every time  they would put one up, they would put where they were from in Mexico.  They were really proud of that fact. I   m kind of proud of them for  recognizing that they are basically going to be of two nations because I  guess that   s what I was: Caddo Nation, but I   m also United States.  (Laughter)  That   s a great story. Anything else you   d like to add before we look at  your pots?  I don   t think so. I think I   ve pretty well   let me add this. I grew up in  Colony, Oklahoma, and I told you I had five sisters and two brothers, so  we were a large family. I wanted people to know that we didn   t grow up  in   we danced the dances, but it was difficult. We didn   t make our  dresses or our clothing, but we   d go to all the dances. So it   s been really  fun for us to explore that part of actually partaking. I think it connected  me to a lot of the Caddo children here in the metro, women, women and  little girls, or men, because they are basically cut off. We are trying to  bring those traditions here.  Yes, you   ve had a huge impact. It   s clear. Well, great, we   ll take a look  at your work. What would you like to tell us about these, Jeri?  This particular pot is one that is probably a replica of the one that is in  the Oval Office, and it belongs to my sister. The particular design would  be from around Nacogdoches, Texas. This design on this bowl is one  22  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  that you would find   it   s called Natchitoches engraved. It would be like  Natchitoches, Louisiana. It   s kind of midway between Shreveport and  New Orleans. That   s where the town is.  I just wanted to ask one quick question about that beautiful  crosshatching, and it   s so ornate. I understand Charles has made a  couple special tools for you?  I used to use bone to actually do the crosshatching. That was my tools. I  had about three that were sharpened bones, and then I   d wrap leather  around them. I also tried to use flint. I was trying to figure,    What were  they using?    Probably flint, but then I changed to a more modern tool,  and it is steel.  Then the rubbing of the color in, you get that using     I use a brush to rub the color in. The neat thing about that is if I burnish  them, when I burnish them with the stone, that the crosshatching will  take in all of the clay, and the rest of it will just rub off.  Right. That   s really neat.  If it   s not burnished, it will not rub off.  That   s got a figure, doesn   t it? You can really see the figures.  This is one that I took liberty with. This is a piece that I made for Red  Earth two years ago. I think it won in the Traditional division. This was  a figure that was found on a shell from Spiral Mounds, I assume an  ornate shell, that I believe is at the University of Oklahoma. There are  two figures there. I call them the Hasinai Twins because the Caddos, in  their religion, they had a Chenesi who took care of the temple on the  mound or the temple in the village. He would go to a box that held the  coninisi which were the twins. There were two boys. He would open up  the box, and it would talk to him and tell him what to do.  When the Spanish priest came, he said,    There   s nobody in that box.  Why are you doing this?    So he went to his church, actually, and pushed  his way in and opened the box. Went past the Chenesi and opened up the  box and said,    There   s nothing there,    little realizing that he believed in  the Holy Ghost that no one had ever seen or heard. (Laughter) At any  rate, it was such an interesting moment.  I did do this, and instead of putting it on a shell, I put it on a pot,  representing some of the things   I know that this would   ve been the  Coon Dance, the raccoon. We have a Raccoon Dance. Actually, I don   t  23  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  Little Thunder  Redcorn  think we do it now, but we did have.  Do you want to talk about this piece?  The tripod, the archaeologists would call it friendship engraved, but I  named it Taysha because    taysha    is the word for    friend    in Caddo. It  is a fairly good representation of a pot that I saw, a picture of it, when I  went to the Red River Museum. It   s very interesting because I think in  the Caddo world, there is a tripod. There   s the sky, and there   s the  middle, the earth, and there   s the underground. I do not know if that   s  what that represents, but I think a tripod is interesting.  The other thing about the tripod, is that as a math teacher, you know that  when you have three, it can sit level. If you have four legs, there   s that  possibility of it being a little bit unstable, which you see, like when  people have a campfire, they will put three sticks up and hang their pot  from under there. That   s the most stable. That   s a very stable form. I was  talking about the effigies that I see or that I use. The duck here is an  effigy. We have the Duck Dance. Kon-Koa-Shun is our Duck Dance. In  the back one, you can see   this is probably a very good example of  Caddo forms. On it, I did put a dancing turkey, and I call this Nuh-Koa-  Shun. I actually wrote    Nuh-Koa-Shun    on the back. Nuh-Koa-Shun is  our Turkey Dance.  Does that have your signature, too? I meant to ask you how you sign  your pieces.  I sign them by   okay, here   s this one here. I write into it    J. C. Redcorn,  Caddo.    I haven   t actually finished this, but I am. What I   m going to do  is, around the pot, around this vessel, I   m going to inscribe the names of  our Caddo chiefs. We had a show at the Oklahoma History Center  recently, and they wrote all of the names of the Caddos here. That   s  what I was going to put on that.  I think that   ll look neat.  I will have, when it   s finished,    Caddo Leadership and Community.     Well, thank you so much for your time today.  Oh, you   re welcome. Thank you for coming. This is a wonderful project.  -------  -------
