LIZ LUNDEEN:  Today is July 26th, 2012.  This is Liz Lundeen with the Southern Oral History Program, and I am here with Marjorie Northup in her home in Winston-Salem.  And we&#8217;re just going to talk about Marjorie&#8217;s activism through the years.  But we&#8217;ll start out, Marjorie, if you could say a little bit about your early life growing up, where you were born, where you grew up, that kind of thing.  MARJORIE NORTHUP:  I was born here in Winston-Salem, the fourth of five children.  My father worked for Reynolds Tobacco Company for forty-seven years.  My mother was always at home with the five children.  We lived there near the downtown in a big home that my grandparents had built.  LL:  Great, and can you say something about your siblings?  You said you were one of--.  MN:  I had twin sisters that were older than I was and then a brother and then I was in the middle and then a younger sister.  LL:  You mentioned just in passing that the church was a big part of your life.    MN:  Yes, it was.  LL:  So I&#8217;m wondering if you could say a little bit about that, the role that religion played in your family.  MN:  Well, my mother was brought up as a Methodist, but when she married my father she became a Baptist, and we were there as I say for every service including Wednesday nights, Sunday morning and Sunday night at First Baptist Church.  It was a few blocks walking distance.  My father was a head usher there for many years, and my mother taught Sunday school.  It was a very active and good part of our life.  LL:  Did you go to a church-based school or did you go to public school when you were growing up?  MN:  No, I went to Wiley School where I met my husband.  LL:  Oh wow.  MN:  And then Reynolds High School.  LL:  Oh great.  Yeah.  So was your husband, I&#8217;m guessing was a classmate?  MN:  Well, he was my brother&#8217;s best friend.  I just laugh and say we met in the fifth grade, but actually we didn&#8217;t start dating until we both came back here to work after going to college.  But he was a good friend of my brother&#8217;s.  LL:  So growing up in Winston, this would&#8217;ve been what, the [19]30s and the [19]40s, is that right?  MN:  Right.  LL:  I&#8217;m just curious, what do you remember about race relations at that time as a young person living in the city?  MN:  Well, I wasn&#8217;t very even aware what race relations meant.  The only blacks that I knew in any way were the people that worked for us.  Although we were not rich at all, when I look back on it, I can&#8217;t believe how many people.  We had a man that kept up our yard.  We had a woman that would come in and cook.  We had another woman that would come in and iron.  The only thing I remember a little bit different was I never will forget, the woman who came in and ironed was very large.  To go in the front of the house you only went up like two or three steps.  To come into the back door of the house, you had to go up a huge amount of very steep steps.  I remember one time asking my mother, I said, &#8220;Mother, why does Viola come up those steep steps in the back because she&#8217;s so large?&#8221;  Mother said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the way she&#8217;s supposed to come.&#8221;  That just made me think, but I don&#8217;t even think at that time I thought it was because she was black.  I just thought it was because she was a servant.  And servants always came to the back door.  LL:  Yeah.  Do you know what the people that worked at your home, what they, I mean was that their primary job or do you know if they worked for other people?  MN:  Well, I think our yardman, he washed the windows.  He worked for two or three others.  Sometime during the growing up we&#8217;d have somebody there every single day.  My mother with five children was a lot of work and a lot of clothes to wash and a lot of cooking to be done.  I don&#8217;t think I ever saw my mother cook.  It was the ladies that worked for us.  So therefore when I got married, I didn&#8217;t know how to cook.  [laughs] It had already been done for us in the kitchen.    LL:  So outside of you remember asking your mom why Viola came in the back door, do you remember any other things that your parents would&#8217;ve said about sort of their attitudes on race or just sort of perceived?  MN:  I've talked to my sisters and they said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ever go to their homes?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;No.&#8221;  They had when they were taken home sometime.  I think they mostly came by bus.  They just said it was just pitiful.  One of them she thought didn&#8217;t even have electricity.  I didn&#8217;t know that until I grew up.  I know they were just paid a few dollars a week.    LL:  Well, so I've asked about religion.  What would you say was the view on education in your family?  Was it always seen as important?  MN:  Top, top priority.  Top priority.  That was it.  All of us were to do well in school.  I&#8217;ll never forget the five of us, all the report cards being out there.  We were all expected to make A&#8217;s, B&#8217;s, no C&#8217;s whatsoever.  We were always expected--. As we said, the top thing.  My grandmother was a teacher, both of them.  And that was just expected of us, and I think we looked forward to it.  I always looked forward to going to college.    LL:  So it was always, college was also&#8212;  MN:  Well, there were four girls and one boy.  Now my brother fortunately was smart enough to do this.  They always told him, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to be a doctor.&#8221;  I was thinking later, suppose he didn&#8217;t have the brains to do it.  I thought later too, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they tell us for us to be a doctor?&#8221;  But fortunately he went on.  He went to Wake Forest and then to Bowman Gray.  He made a very good doctor.  But the women, my father always said, &#8220;You&#8217;re all going to get your teaching certificate.&#8221;  All four of us says, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to get our teaching certificate.  We probably won&#8217;t teach.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to get your teaching certificate.&#8221;  And so we did.  I think almost all of us taught.  LL:  Wow.  So the girls were going to be teachers.  Your brother was going to be a doctor.    MN:  That&#8217;s it.  LL:  And you said both your grandmother&#8217;s were teachers.  MN:  That&#8217;s right.  LL:  And remind me.  You may have already said, did your mom go to college?  Did she get--  MN:  Yeah, she was a teacher.  That&#8217;s how she got there.  That&#8217;s an interesting story.  She was brought up, and that&#8217;s another thing about her feelings about race relations probably.  She was brought up on a farm in South Georgia.  The people that still work there when we would go there to visit in the summer, they were the children of slaves.  So that was her background as far as the blacks.  I think that&#8217;s why she probably thought they, although she never, never said it, you just get the feeling you felt like they weren&#8217;t say as good as we were, something like that.    But she graduated from Georgia State College for Women in Milledgeville.  She got on a train with about twenty other women and came to Winston-Salem.  They all had jobs with the Winston-Salem schools.  They had gone-- I guess the school superintendent, whoever, had gone down to Georgia, I guess to that teacher&#8217;s college and recruited.  And every one of those women that came up here, I think they lived in a teacherage, which would offer meals to anybody.  All of them practically met their husbands there and married and stayed here.  LL:  And that&#8217;s where she met your dad when she got to Winston.  He was working&#8212;  MN:  That&#8217;s right.  LL:  At Reynolds.  Right, so it was, it was expected that you would go to college and you did.  MN:  Absolutely.  LL:  And you went to Meredith.  MN:  That&#8217;s right.  LL:  And did you think about going elsewhere or was Meredith sort of it?  MN:  No, they just said that&#8217;s where you&#8217;re going.  It&#8217;s interesting because I was thinking if I told my kids where they were going, what they were going to do, I mean they would&#8217;ve just, no telling what they would do.  But we, all five of us just fell right in line and did what they said for us to do.  Meredith was a good choice.  I mean I, if I could&#8217;ve had my way, I would&#8217;ve loved to have gone out of state, just get a new experience.  But I got some, my husband really believed in traveling.  I got a lot of experience later on doing different things.  LL:  So this would&#8217;ve been, the late [19]40s, is that right when you would&#8217;ve gone to Meredith?  MN:  That&#8217;s right.  I went in [19]47.  I graduated in [19]51.  LL:  Can you say a little bit about your time there, what you studied, what your memories are?  MN:  Yeah.  Well, I knew I had to get a teacher certificate.  I loved art so I took as much art as I could, but I thought mistakenly that you had to be an artist to be an [art] teacher.  So I ended up, and that was a good thing on my part because I liked to do things, different things in the summer.  Nobody wanted to come home.  So I would go to summer school, and that&#8217;s where I got my teacher certificate in English.  So that&#8217;s what, I took a lot of art. I was always taking as many courses or more every semester and did well.  And I was president of the student government.  I did everything.  I did some crazy things too.  LL:  Well, say something if you will about some of the crazy things in addition to student government, what kind of activities?  MN:  Okay.  Well, one of the things I could&#8217;ve been shipped home and people still laughing about it is that I had this friend at North Carolina State, and he was editor of the Tarnation [actually, the Technician, NC State&#8217;s student newspaper] magazine or had something to do with it.  He had this idea that it would be fun for women to run through the men&#8217;s dormitories.  You know they didn&#8217;t allow women over there.  They were so strict.  So I had a friend at Meredith, and she also had a lot of responsibilities at a student.  We dressed up as men and we had these guys helping us.  We went over to North Carolina State, and we ran through the dormitories.  They took pictures of us.  We were pausing looking at they first latrine I'd ever seen.  And we got back, we almost got caught.  But we got back to Meredith safely, and I thought, gosh I am just crazy. [laughter] I&#8217;m on the student government.  I mean if they had caught us, I would&#8217;ve been shipped home.  Then, I had a friend that, at the, it wasn&#8217;t the Tarnation.  I can&#8217;t remember what their [student newspaper was called]. [I] had a friend at Chapel Hill that heard about it so got us to run through the dorms at Chapel Hill.  And they put out, the Tarnation was the Chapel Hill magazine.  I never will forget it, came out and says, the cover says, &#8220;Mothers, where are your daughters?&#8221;  So that&#8217;s about the craziest thing.  Isn&#8217;t that a good one?  LL:  That is a good one.  MN:  Now, of course, everyone&#8217;s sleeping all around.    LL:  What, what were sort of the rules and regulations?  I mean, was there a curfew on campus at that time?  MN:  Oh yeah.  Had to be in, oh wish they had more of it now.  Maybe people would have a better education.  Every night at Meredith, you had to either be in the library or your room, like from seven to ten every weeknight, I mean Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.  I think Friday we were allowed to get out.  So we were.  I mean all we did was study.  It was very hard.  Very, very good professors  I think I got the best education anybody could get because all I was doing was studying.  You didn&#8217;t have time to do anything else.    LL:  Do you think there was, did you have a sense that there was kind of a progressive pulse among some of the students?  MN:  Progressive what?  LL:  Just a progressive feeling, progressive pulse.  I mean, were there other students who you think were thinking about say, and this would&#8217;ve been the late [19]40s, the [19]50s &#8211; thinking about civil rights or thinking about&#8212;   MN:  Yeah, I've got one of my&#8212;  LL:  Progressive issues.  MN:  Yeah, what was the, one of my professors got me to go to be a part of Americans for Democratic Action.  Now that was a sort of an offbeat thing, and we went over to Chapel Hill.  And then as president of student government we&#8217;d get with other student government [chapters].  I got some feeling that other things were going on that weren&#8217;t that active at Meredith, but they were out there.  But the pivotal thing was when I took this trip that you know a little bit about up to Nashville, Tennessee&#8212;  LL:  And that was part of student government.  MN:  Yes.  And whoever was taking us we had this station wagon and went around, several from Meredith and some from North Carolina State, some from Saint Augustine&#8217;s, some from Peace.  We were on our way up there, and we get out of town, we&#8217;re all hungry so we stop to get&#8212;the ones from Saint Augustine&#8217;s [a historically black college], we couldn&#8217;t find any place for them to eat.  I  just couldn&#8217;t believe it.  I said, &#8220;What?&#8221;  I mean, I just could not believe it.  It just knocked me out.  Then I was thinking this has gone on for years and I didn&#8217;t even know it.  They couldn&#8217;t even go to the bathroom.  So what we would do, we&#8217;d call somebody knew somebody in the Methodist church like in Asheville.  We stopped at a Methodist church, where we all went in, and they&#8217;d prepared sandwiches for us and they could go to the bathroom.  Can you believe it?  I mean that is just something.    LL:  And then when you got to Fisk [University, in Nashville, TN], what kind of activities did you have there?  Was it like a conference?  MN:  Yeah, like a conference.  I really don&#8217;t remember.  I remember staying in the home of the president of Fisk University.  LL:  Oh wow.  MN:  And it was just beautiful, and I was thinking, suppose my family knew I was staying and spending the night in a black person&#8217;s home.  I thought, they just wouldn&#8217;t know what to think.  I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d come down and say that&#8217;s the worst thing.  But I think they would just be so shocked.  And it was so beautiful, and they were just the most gracious people you&#8217;d ever met, and that&#8217;s the first time I really, well, I knew the students but to ever know that a black person lived like that, and that shows you how ignorant I was.    LL:  Was it Johnson, was it President Charles Johnson?  MN:  I can&#8217;t remember.  LL:  I don&#8217;t remember.  MN:  That sounds familiar.    LL:  I don&#8217;t remember&#8212;  MN:  I think so.  I think--  LL:  When he was&#8212;  MN:  It was.  LL:  Was finished.  MN:  Maybe it was.    LL:  But I think it would&#8217;ve been late [19]40s.  So the students from Saint Aug&#8217;s, did you just meet them when you got to go on the trip or had you&#8212;  MN:  That&#8217;s right.  No, didn&#8217;t see them before, I mean didn&#8217;t know them before; didn&#8217;t know them afterwards.    LL:  Just kind of that one whirlwind experience.    MN:  That&#8217;s right.  That&#8217;s right.  LL:  So what do you remember feeling afterwards?  MN:  Mostly I was just shocked that that had gone on for so long, and I think it just put a little something, kernel in my brain to think that maybe I could do something to make this different, some day.  Not thinking I could do anything right there or now.  LL:  And when you got back to Meredith, were you involved in any organizations that were looking towards civil rights, looking towards&#8212;  MN:  No, no.  Nope, nope.  LL:  It was still early yet.  MN:  Oh yeah.  It was very early also.  LL:  What about sort of women&#8217;s organizations?  You were at a women&#8217;s college but was there a chapter of like the Y or&#8212;  MN:  I was very active at Meredith in the League of Women Voters.  LL:  Okay.  MN:  I never will forget we would go and testify down at the legislature, and one of the things we were going to testify against is they were getting ready to build the big what is the name of that huge arena [Dorton Arena in Raleigh, NC].  I can&#8217;t remember.  You know the one I&#8217;m talking about, where all the fair is and everything.    LL:  Oh the state fair.  MN:  And it was just going to cost millions and millions of dollars and millions of dollars, and they were cutting stuff.  I mean, the mental health needed, and I was taking a lot of psychology, too.  They would take, they were needing so much more money for mental health, which they couldn&#8217;t do because they were going to build this big pavilion.  So and our psychology class, we decided somebody&#8217;s got to go down there and testify.  So the way they did it was we put all our names in the hat and mine was pulled out.  So I laugh now because they dressed me to the hilts.  I think I even had fur on.  I went down and testified, we all worked on it.  It was a wonderful thing because we all worked on it together in this psychology class, what I was going to say, and they had gotten all this, they knew what they were talking about.  How much had been spent, had not been spent on this, how much was going to be spent, the difference it would make and so forth.  That was one of the first, maybe some of the last time that I had spoken before&#8212;that was not the whole legislature.  That was a committee&#8212;  LL:  Committee.  MN:  Before it went to the legislature to vote.  So that was pretty exciting.  It was very exciting to me to be in Raleigh.  That&#8217;s one of the things I loved, you could have a date every night if you wanted because there were thousands over at State, and my class figured that within twenty-five miles there were sixty-three and two-tenths of a man for every girl on the campus.  Somebody said later, well, I got the two-tenths.  [laughs]  So I just had a wonderful time.  It was great.  I loved Meredith.  I loved one of my English teachers, [she] was a first woman graduate of Yale, and they were just, I just learned a whole lot.  One of my teachers in education, I loved him.  He was just so far off base and you went into&#8212;that&#8217;s another reason I loved&#8212;you went into his class and he said, &#8220;I want to tell you something first.  I don&#8217;t believe in the virgin birth.&#8221;  Now we all just about fell out.  But isn&#8217;t it a wonder that Meredith didn&#8217;t fire him.  That&#8217;s great. [laughter]  LL:  So tell me  a little bit about the League of Women Voters, what kind of activities you were involved in?  MN:  Well, they were just trying to get people to know what was going on and to know how to vote.  It was really making you a much better citizen because you would not vote just like you wouldn&#8217;t miss a meal.  You wouldn&#8217;t miss a vote, but you&#8217;d always find out what the, what the items were you should think about and what the person was like.  When I got to Winston-Salem, that&#8217;s one of the first organizations I ever got into in Winston-Salem.  And I never met a smarter group of women.  Sorry to say it&#8217;s not anymore in Winston-Salem.  We sort of merged with Greensboro, but it didn&#8217;t work out .  Nobody&#8217;s going over to Greensboro to the meetings.  LL:  Yeah, so in the 1950s when you were active there in Raleigh, what kind of issues would they sort of look at candidates based on.  I mean, would they women&#8217;s issues or would it sort of be larger progressive issues?  MN:  No, I think larger just like I was talking about where the money was being spent.  Is it education or is it spent or is it being spent on a huge arena.  That&#8217;s still there and going pretty well I guess.  LL:  That&#8217;s where the state fair is every year, right?  What about the YW, was that?  MN:  The YWCA was a very important part of my life here.  They said right at the beginning, that was back in the [19]50s when I was married and living here, that one of their main goals was to eliminate racism.  And they worked on it.  And that&#8217;s where I first formed African American friends.  Because it was the only YWCA here in Winston-Salem, and it was on Glade Street.  It had a cafeteria.  Get this now.  It was the only place in Winston-Salem where blacks and whites could eat together, the only place.  Doesn&#8217;t that say something for the Y?  LL:  Yeah.  Now that would&#8217;ve been, what year did you come to Winston?  MN:  I came, well, I graduated [19]51, came right here.    LL:  Wow.    MN:  So anyway, that just really gave me a new thing. One thing that happened to me at the Y I think is one of the&#8212; I got an award for that through the Chronicle that black paper [points at a copy of the Chronicle on the table].  We decided when the schools were integrating, that was in the [19]60s, some of us at the Y decided that we could do something about that.  So we formed an idea, what we called dialogue groups.  And what we did was we got a grant from the Winston-Salem Foundation.  Get this: the Chamber of Commerce actually gave us a desk at the Chamber where we could meet and get this all going.  So I hired a secretary and what we did was we would look at all the schools were getting ready to be paired.  Like this white school and that black school and this white school and that black school.  So we got the names of the people, head of PTA or whatever they were.  And we paired them.  We would call them up, and we could tell [from] where they were whether they were black or white.  So I would call us and we&#8217;d say, &#8220;This is so and so calling for the YWCA dialogue groups.  We&#8217;re starting a dialogue group, and we&#8217;d very much like for you to be a part of it.  We&#8217;re meeting in the boardroom at the Chamber of Commerce.  Can we count on you?  This will be a four-time meeting, and you&#8217;re going to be paired with a school that you&#8217;re going to be to be paired with this fall.  And we&#8217;d also like to have the names of some teenagers to invite.&#8221;  So we got over thousands of people to do that.  We did them at churches; that was the most prestigious, when we asked them to come to the&#8212;  LL:  The boardroom.  MN: The boardroom.  But we did them all over, and it was probably one of the best things I ever did was because they, and I got an award, too, for that.  I got an award from the National Volunteer something in America for helping pivot the most, what is it?  One of the best integrations that took place.  That&#8217;s pretty good.  LL:  Wow.  Well, let&#8217;s backtrack for a minute and talk about how this idea came about for the dialogue groups.  I mean, presumably there&#8217;s a lot of opposition to the integration.  MN:  Oh yeah.  One of them I helped run, too, that the school board set up (that was when they were down on Academy.  We just passed that place there.  They had a building down there.)  They set up a place where you could call in, and I was a volunteer and gosh these people would just call in and I just couldn&#8217;t believe what they said.  I love what my kids tell me.  They said, &#8220;The two things we remember,&#8221; my twins when they were growing up said, &#8220;Number one, we remember going down to that school thing every day where you were listen to phone calls and talking to people.&#8221;    And the other thing they remember and I love this one, is one of the things they would, we had the, oh what are the, what is the one that Bobby Seale and all those, the Black Panthers.  Okay.  They formed a Black Panther here, and what they were doing, the two things the Black Panthers were doing were&#8212; The ambulance would not take, go get the black people to take them to the hospital.  Can you believe it?  And they were giving free breakfasts to kids that were coming to school starving.  Those are two things they did.  So they had the worst, you&#8217;d have thought they were all criminals and were going to [be put] in jail.  So the worst, so I was thinking, and what can I do?  It was just coming out every day awful.  I thought, well, on Lincoln&#8217;s birthday I decided to take a cake over to the Black Panthers&#8217; headquarters.  And I took the kids with me of course.  They were standing there in their uniforms.  They said that&#8217;s one of the earliest memories they had, my taking them over to the Black Panthers to deliver the birthday cake.  It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Happy Birthday Abraham Lincoln and the Black Panthers,&#8221; and that&#8217;s where I got to know the head Black Panther.  He became, he teaches at Winston-Salem State.  Who is he?  Uh come on.  Got to know him.  [Larry Little]  LL:  I&#8217;ll write it down; maybe we can come back to.    MN:  He&#8217;s the one that got helped get the guy out of jail that had been there for years.  LL:  Oh that helped with Daryl Hunt&#8217;s case.  MN:  Oh what is the guy&#8217;s name.  Well, anyway we became friends from then on.  We just see each other different places.  Well, anyway, I have a sense of humor, too.  Things like that are, it&#8217;s scary but fun.    LL:  So the people who were involved in the dialogue groups, were those predominantly women or&#8212;  MN:  No, it was&#8212;  L:  Was it mostly members of the PTA?  MN:  Yeah, it was just a really good cross section of people.  LL:  The people that you called?  MN:  It was wonderful.  It was just great.    LL:  And how, why do you think, like the Chamber of Commerce, I mean it sound like they were pretty amenable to the dialogue groups&#8212;  MN:  Yeah, because they were scared to death.  They were forming these committees, this committee, trying to get people to work together.  And I was on the big committee and never will forget, they took us up to, couldn't believe this, to Mount Airy to a motel for a weekend.  A pretty good cross-section of people from out&#8212;it&#8217;s just like Jerry Drayton [Reverend Jerry Drayton, a local civil rights activist] that we just saw in the film.  He was talking about that.  He was saying, &#8220;They call me up and asked me to be on this committee.&#8221;  That&#8217;s the same committee, can&#8217;t remember what it was called.  But I tell you, when the Chamber called, they jump.  So that&#8217;s why we got the dialogues going so well.    LL:  Right.  Right.  Great.  So you think, I mean, how did integration play out in Winston-Salem.  You said when you got the national award it was for one of the most successful sort of integration schemes.  MN:  I think it did real well, but it took a lot of work.  If we hadn&#8217;t had those dialogue groups, if we hadn&#8217;t had those phone calls down there, I think it would&#8217;ve, when you saw what was happening.  I mean, they certainly just didn&#8217;t embrace each other and so forth.  But they didn&#8217;t have any, as far as I can remember, they didn&#8217;t have any bad incidences at school.  And it&#8217;s crazy the way they did it, I&#8217;ll never forget my kids were in the first grade, they started off exchanging teachers.  So a white teacher from [our] school was sent over to a black school, and a black teacher was sent over to a white school.  Well, the black teacher, I had twins remember.  The black teacher that came over and I was assisting, I mean, she was shaking the whole time.  It was just pitiful.  It was pitiful.  We did all we could to help her, but I never will forget going to the principal at the end of, I just said this just isn't for her.  She needs to go to a place where she feels comfortable.  She was an older woman.  And sure enough, they sent her back somewhere to the kindergarten or something.  It all worked out fine.  I felt very bad about that.  But it was a terrible thing for some people.  They didn&#8217;t, I mean she probably never had had a white friend as long, like some of the black ones didn&#8217;t have&#8212;black never had a white friend; whites never had a black friend.    So it took some getting used to especially when you were, my family certainly would never say anything bad about black people, say it.  But they were sort of standoffish.  You think all those homes that people came from, that they were raised in, that used the N word that thought&#8212;. I never will forget taking my kids to Sears one time.  It says white only, colored only [on the water fountains].  So one of mine ran up to the colored only and I said, &#8220;Excuse me.  You just can&#8217;t use that.&#8221;  They said, &#8220;Why not?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Well, use that one.&#8221;  They said, &#8220;Well, I wanted some colored water.&#8221;  [laughing]  Don&#8217;t you love it.  I mean your kids can really teach you.  I want some colored water.  Is it blue?  Is it green?  Well, I just couldn't, I didn&#8217;t even tell them.  I just didn&#8217;t want them to know.  [laughing]    LL:  Oh my.  So let&#8217;s talk about when you came here, we&#8217;ve moved forward, but right, when you came to Winston before you had kids did you teach when you got here?  MN:  I had taken psychology.  I loved it.  I thought well, that would be a good&#8212;and I wanted to be a, I really wanted to be an art teacher, but I thought you had to be an artist.  So I got a job because I knew a guy over at the hospital in the pastoral care, and he was writing a book, Dick Young.  So I went in there as his secretary and actually typed his whole book and actually took some pastoral care courses and just realized, and I got a certificate in it, realized that wasn&#8217;t for me and went back to school to Salem College and got my teaching certificate in art and taught briefly and then started having kids.  So that took care of that.    LL:  And that would&#8217;ve been the early [19]60s when you had kids.  MN:  That&#8217;s right.  LL:  So your husband so we can just say for the tape was an architect and a sculptor, yeah.  MN:  Right.  And he was very open.  He lived a life, I mean the first people I had gotten to know really, I mean, he had worked with a lot of black people.  He, the first house we lived in he would have them come in to talk to them, have a seat, give them a drink.  That was the first time I'd ever seen that when husband invited them in.  They weren&#8217;t people on his working level.  They were people who worked for him that he needed to talk to and he&#8217;d give them money when they needed it and things like that.  I never had seen anything like that  So he really lived, I would say, a Christian life.  He really would live what he believed in.  But the really pivotal thing that happened at that time, I had those twins, three under three, and my husband were looking after the twins one Sunday morning while I went to church&#8212;it was in, I can&#8217;t remember what year in the [19]60s.  Our minister said, &#8220;I have a very important something for you to listen to carefully.  It&#8217;s from the national church.  The presiding bishop has asked every rector in every Episcopal church in the United States to read this to his thing.&#8221;  So I was sitting in the back.  And what it said is everybody in the Episcopal Church has got to do something to eliminate racism.  And I was sitting down there and when he said that.  &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to get out, look for something, do something, make a change in the world.  This is what Jesus would have you do.&#8221;  I remember hearing that and going [makes sound like a gong], I mean it was just like it hit me through the head.  I thought, I can&#8217;t believe it.  So I kept thinking about it and thinking about it.    So I got home, didn&#8217;t say anything about it to my husband at that time and I opened up the paper and it said there was going to be a meeting of CORE, C-O-R-E, it&#8217;s the Congress [for] Racial Equality.  So I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to this CORE meeting.  You weren&#8217;t at church today, but they said we&#8217;ve all got to do something.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;What?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t mind looking after the kids a little longer this afternoon.  I&#8217;ve got to go there.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;I just don&#8217;t understand that.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;I know there will be a lot of people [from] Saint Paul&#8217;s.  They heard the same thing I heard.&#8221;  Well, I went out there.  There were two white women.  All the rest of them were black.  But I got involved in it.  And they were the ones that were really heading up the marches to try to get the K &amp; W [integrated], that was the big thing, the K &amp; W [cafeteria] downtown, which I ate at.  They were marching all the time like that.  My husband came back and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m behind you and all this.  I just have to ask you one thing.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;What is it?&#8221;  He says, &#8220;You cannot go to jail.&#8221;  Of course they were going to jail every day.  He said, &#8220;Because we just adopted these twins, and they&#8217;re just liable to take them away if you&#8217;re sitting down in jail.&#8221;  So I said, &#8220;Well, okay.&#8221;    So I went to the meeting, learned all the songs, took sandwiches up there to them and watched them march.  But I did not march myself.  Sorry about that, but I guess he was right.  They probably would&#8217;ve snatched those kids right away if I was sitting down in the jail.  Although and the wonderful thing about that though is that the head of &#8211; I don&#8217;t know if the actual head of CORE, but a lot of the meetings were at Saint Stephen&#8217;s Episcopal Church, and Father Smith was the head person.  He was going to jail every day practically.  He was the head of it, and I was really excited that the Episcopal church, I mean the black Episcopal Church did&#8212; But you know Saint Paul&#8217;s [Episcopal], my own church, I would call those people to make sandwiches, to give money.  They all would do it.  They all would do it.  Nobody turned me down, but they didn&#8217;t want to go up there [to the marches].  I can understand that.  I mean I wasn&#8217;t going myself to go to jail.  But anyway, that was a long hot summer, and it ended with buses, and I never will, being so sad.  Again I couldn&#8217;t go, going up to hear Martin Luther King in Washington.  But I went up where the buses were again, took the sandwiches, took the money, told them good-bye, and it was a wonderful thing that they did.    LL:  So that would have been in [19]63, when you were still going to the CORE meetings.  MN:  Right.  Right.  That&#8217;s when I adopted our kids, in [19]63.  LL:  Wow.  So would you say, you said there were two other white women then at the meeting.  MN:  I don&#8217;t remember well, I don&#8217;t want to say this&#8212;  LL:  Oh no that&#8217;s fine.  MN:  In a way, but they, they [CORE] brought down some women&#8212;I&#8217;m not prejudiced against&#8212;from the North to help us.  And that&#8217;s who they were.    LL:  So you were the only person, the only white person from Winston-Salem at that first meeting.  MN:  As far as I knew&#8212;  LL:  As far as you knew.  MN:  But I got to know Mitzi Shumate, was a good friend of mine.  She taught art at Winston-Salem State.  Her husband taught at Salem College and she was very active in that.    LL:  Okay.  So [you met her] through CORE and through that early sort of support in the marches, making sandwiches that kind of thing&#8212;  MN:  Getting money.  LL:  Yeah, getting money.  What, what was sort of the next step in your activism?  MN:  Well, you know you&#8217;d think, yeah I've done the dialogue group, I've gone through that.  You&#8217;d think well, then I went to work full-time at Reynolda House.  And you&#8217;d think why am I going to carry-on there.  I mean because I still felt it in my heart even though things were getting better, getting better, getting better.  What I was able to do there is one of the things I really feel good about.  I was able to start a program called &#8220;Examining your Prejudices by Looking at American Art.&#8221; We had one painting that was very, it&#8217;s by Charles Gwalthney and it&#8217;s called, &#8220;Belle, B-E-L-L-E.&#8221;  And it has this woman who is doing he loves me, loves me not, he loves me and she&#8217;s, she&#8217;s got this hair-do, and then in the background there&#8217;s a minister with two crosses&#8212;one burning cross and one plain cross.  And there&#8217;s a black man in there with his hands tied behind his back and he&#8217;s in a, sort of in a hole.    So that was a pivotal thing, but as you go through the paintings of American art, there are a lot of them [involving] discrimination.  It&#8217;s not just black and white like that one that I named.  But on old and young and some of the others.  What I would do is I would, we&#8217;d invite people and have a panel.  I'd have a panel &#8211; not just a panel of blacks.  Sometimes I'd have a Chinese [person].  Sometimes a Jew.  We heard their stories, and people that came just said they&#8217;d never heard stories like that in their life.  Of course they hadn&#8217;t.  It was sort of like those dialogue groups.  They&#8217;d never heard their story.  So I did that and then it was a success.    We started out small.  So we looked, we&#8217;d call the Chamber.  We&#8217;d call the businesses, and they would, Wachovia sent&#8212;  That was before sensitivity training I think.  So they thought this would be a good thing.  So I got a lot of satisfaction by that.  I was asked to come to national meetings and talk about it and demonstrate it.  I would take slides and so forth of some of our paintings that we worked on.  So that was really fun.  LL:  And when did you start at Reynolda House?  MN:  When did I start working there?  Let&#8217;s see.  In the late [19]70s I believe it was.  LL:  So just, if I can flash back here a minute too and ask, did you continue working with the Y through that whole period during the [19]60s or&#8212;  MN:  No, I think the Y, after I did that [the dialogue groups], not that much.  After I did that I was on the board, kept up with and still do.  Some of those friendships I made with African Americans at the Y I still see them, get with them and so forth.  LL:  So I mentioned earlier before the tape was one that I'd found an interview that you had done back in the [19]80s.  And said you had participated in swim-ins.  MN:  Oh yeah.  That was&#8212;  LL:  And I was very intrigued by that because you hear of sit-ins and sit-downs.  MN:  I love it.  Oh yeah.  Probably a lot of things like that if you&#8212;  During the integration when I couldn&#8217;t go to jail, I had a friend.  One of the things we decided to do, one of the, people were very upset because Reynolds Park owned by the, Reynolds Pool, owned by the city.  Blacks had been trying, you know they lived right around there, been trying to get in.  They couldn&#8217;t.  So I asked this friend of mine who&#8217;s almost as white as I am, but she&#8217;s black.  We decided to have a swim-in.  So she and I went over to Reynolds Park.  We both paid [phone ringing] both paid, went in.  And then the somebody right behind us came, a black and a white.  They kind of, they tried to get in.  They couldn't get in.  So we rushed up there.  We said, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t they get in?&#8221;  The person said, &#8220;Well, blacks aren&#8217;t allowed here.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Well, we got in and she&#8217;s black.&#8221;  So anyway, they didn&#8217;t change anything, but I think it sort of knocked them out.  So we did that a couple of times just to get people aware.  We didn&#8217;t get any [press]&#8212;we should&#8217;ve had the paper there.  You know they didn&#8217;t pick up on stuff like that.  LL:  It&#8217;s those little things&#8212;  MN:  Yeah.  LL:  So do you remember, do you recall the early February sit-ins, early 1960 downtown?  You were in Winston at that time, right?  MN:  What year was that?  LL:  1960, after Greensboro.  I think it was the lunch counter, not at Woolworth&#8217;s but down at Kress or something.  MN:  Yeah, it was.  I just was aware of it but I think I was just starting my family, and I don&#8217;t think I got involved except just to be aware.  LL:  So it sounds like that in church that day, that was kind of a really pivotal moment.  MN:  That was the wakeup.  Right.    LL:  And what, do you know was it an event&#8212;was it after Kennedy was shot?  What do you think made the Episcopal Church kind of come down?  Was it the King march?  MN:  You know, I don&#8217;t know.    LL:  It&#8217;s really interesting that they would issue a national&#8212;  MN:  When you think about the Episcopal Church, one of the reasons I love it, when I was brought up as a Baptist, I thought I knew everything, had it all boxed in.  When I finally went to the Inquirers Class at the Episcopal Church.  That&#8217;s what they call the confirmation.  First thing the rector that was teaching it said, &#8220;Now if there&#8217;s anybody in this class that doesn&#8217;t have doubts they don&#8217;t belong here.&#8221;  I thought, &#8220;God, I can&#8217;t believe this.&#8221;    LL:  Thank goodness.  MN:  But the Episcopal Church is one of the few mainline churches that never, the Baptists, the Methodists, all of those, in the Civil War they split.  The Episcopal Church never did.  So they&#8217;ve been very aware of it although they weren&#8217;t just screaming it from the rooftops or anything.  But it&#8217;s been there.  They&#8217;ve always had, when they met in triennials, that&#8217;s when they meet every three years, they always had blacks and whites there.  It wasn&#8217;t that they had to have this big thing of coming together again after the Civil War, which I think is really hard. You know they had Southern Presbyterians for a long time and all like that.  Then they had the make it the Presbyterian Church.  LL:  So I wondered if you, I mean were you still working with the League of Women Voters through this period?  I&#8217;m kind of curious as to&#8212;  MN:  I can&#8217;t remember.  LL:  What sort of women&#8217;s organizations you were involved in?  MN:  I was involved in that [the League].  We&#8217;d meet in homes, and we&#8217;d study and we&#8217;d go, I never will forget.  They were so far ahead of their times.  One of them was like clean water and this is why back in the [19]50s.  Can you believe it?    LL:  Yeah, that&#8217;s very impressive.  MN:  And we&#8217;d go to these men&#8217;s [clubs]&#8212;they were desperate for programs.  I can remember going to a Kiwanis club talking about clean water, and I&#8217;m sure they were just like that [gestures, as if to convey dismissal].  And then one of the things we did that was so wonderful, at the courthouse before every election the League of Women Voters would have all the candidates there&#8212;all the Democrats, all the Republicans.  We just packed the courthouse with people, and people would come and listen to them, and it was just wonderful what they did.  So I was working on that just a whole lot and on these, like I said on the water everything they did was good, and everything they did was researched over and over.  I mean they were really some of the smartest women I ever met were in the League of Women Voters.  LL:  It&#8217;s just really interesting because it sounds like you were sort of at the helm.  You were leading a lot of these activities, with the dialogue groups and you said you were leader&#8212;  MN:  That&#8217;s right.  LL:  Back as early as your college days.  MN:  I was the first woman president of Wiley School [laughing].  LL:  Was that an elementary school?  MN:  That&#8217;s right.  So I guess I was just headed that way.  LL:  Did you ever feel, I mean was there any challenge to your authority because you were a woman?  Did you ever feel like there were any men who didn&#8217;t think that&#8212;  MN:  Oh yeah, I&#8217;m sure.  LL: women should be in charge.  MN:  Just like there were some of those committees that I, not [that I was] in charge [of], but some of the committees I've been on through the years, you could tell some of them didn&#8217;t want women on there.  Even the one that was started by the mayor and the Chamber of Commerce, this big committee to look at race and see what we could do about it.  You just felt like you were a, I was a token on quite a few of those committees.  LL:  You mean as the woman.  MN:  Right.  Or one of the few.  LL:  Or one of the few.  MN:  Like they had to have one and on boards too.  I've been on a lot of boards.    LL:  Yeah.  So do you think, was there a moment when you felt like a women&#8217;s movement had arrived in Winston-Salem or women&#8217;s organizations were really starting to sort of take up women&#8217;s issues or feminism?  MN:  I don&#8217;t know.  I think I was just so much more involved in the other.    LL:  Yeah, in the civil rights stuff.  MN:  And that wasn&#8217;t the thrust of the League of Women Voters.  The League of Women Voters was just trying to get people to know what the issues were and to act on them.  They didn&#8217;t, that wasn&#8217;t one of their issues.  Now I have been a member of the NOW [National Organization for Women] and so forth, but I don&#8217;t know if they had an active chapter here, I didn&#8217;t know it.    LL:  Yeah, I was going to ask.  That was one of my questions, too, is I was trying to look and see, and it seemed as though one point, Greensboro and Winston and High Point [NOW chapters] may have gotten lumped together.    MN:  Yeah.  They just couldn&#8217;t get the leadership.  Well, one thing about the League of Women Voters, you just can&#8217;t just get in there and put your name on it.  You have got to work and you&#8217;ve got to read all this stuff and you&#8217;ve got to set up these meetings.  It&#8217;s not just in name only.  I think as you know [women] had gone back to work.  There just weren&#8217;t many, when I was in the League of Women Voters, there wasn&#8217;t a single working person.  Oh they had one night group that met, but we were all women at home, raising our kids and trying to do the best we could.    LL:  Did you ever talk about &#8211; so moving into the 1970s and you started in the late [19]70s working at Reynolda House &#8211; did you ever gather with other women and talk about being a woman and what stuff you faced or&#8212;  MN:  Now the YWCA did have some of that.  I think I might have attended a couple of those, but I didn&#8217;t really get, I just felt very fortunate, and I didn&#8217;t feel like I had to get out there and fight because I had a&#8212;.  I felt like I had a good life and of course a lot of it had to do with my husband.  LL:  Yeah, sounds like it.  MN:  I know a lot of women they were just, they were just expected to work hard for him. My husband always, I always think about what made him real, what made my life the way I wanted to be, he told me one time.  His mother, his father was an architect.  His mother was an artist.  He said he could remember, and they had five kids.  He could remember his mother up in the attic stretching canvas and just wanting so much to spend time painting.  And even though she had help, more help than we did because they had considerably more money than my family did, but she still just like my mother spent most of her time looking after those kids, keeping up with them and so forth.  But he said he thought about later how much that would&#8217;ve meant to her.    And then what happened was when my mother-in-law&#8217;s husband died, Father Northup, she had one child left.  She immediately put that child in prep school, sent him off to military school.  And she went right down to Florida to the Ringling School of Art and took some more art.  She&#8217;d already had one degree in art.  So that just&#8212;.  She was ready to go.  And he built her a studio, and she spent all her time painting and did very well.  Let&#8217;s see I was thinking some of hers were around the corner.  And she had some of hers regularly in the North Carolina museum and they&#8217;d have this once a year time for people to submit work and she always got it in.  She was a very good artist.  I think that he saw her needs and so forth.  So I think that sort of spilled over to me, thank Mother Northup.    LL:  Yeah, so you didn&#8217;t have to fight.  MN:  A lot of my friends were just at their husband&#8217;s beck and call.    LL:  Yeah, it even sounds like when you wanted to go participate in the CORE, I mean your husband looked after the children, right.  MN:  That&#8217;s right.  That was like a few hours.  If I was going out for a long time he wouldn&#8217;t&#8212;.  I don&#8217;t think.    LL:  Let&#8217;s talk about sort of when you got to&#8212;  MN:  Could I have a break?  LL:  Yeah, please.  [break in interviewing]  We&#8217;re just back after a short break.  This is July 26th and this is Liz Lundeen here with Marjorie Northup.  So I just have a couple of questions, to keep moving forward, in your work at Reynolda House when you went back and were there full-time from the [19]70s, late [19]70s on.  How did you, were you able, you mentioned one example with the Examining Your Prejudices Project.  But were there other instances in which you felt you were able to sort of work in your social justice values or things that you would like to see change in the community into your work at Reynolda House?  MN:  I was thinking that program Examining our Prejudice, that&#8217;s the main thing I can think about.  Of course I had a lot of interns coming and working for me, every year.  Usually two or three.  I'd get to know them very well, and I was able to hopefully influence them some.  I was just thinking of something else that I thought about my own children, I never will forget, we had the first black person move into the neighborhood up the street.  And I was out walking one day and somebody said, &#8220;I've got to tell you something, Marjorie.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;What?&#8221;  [He/she said], &#8220;Somebody up there next door to where the blacks were moving in said something about they didn&#8217;t know whether they were going to like that or not and your daughter said &#8211; I think she was about ten &#8211; said &#8211; I had never heard her blast somebody so loud in her life &#8211; [she] said, &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;  Like that.  That really made me&#8212; I hope she didn&#8217;t offend them but maybe she should&#8217;ve.  That made me feel very happy that at least somebody&#8217;s got it.  LL:  You had succeeded.    MN:  Yeah.  LL:  Absolutely.  So what did you do on a day-to-day [basis], what was your job at Reynolda House?  MN: Well, I started part-time in the late [19]70s, part-time in education, that is helping design tours, getting people to lead tours, setting up, and then I became eventually the curator of education.  And then later on I was the assistant director for programs.  So I got to plan all the programs.  I really liked that.  And it was just a lot going on there.  Somebody said later when I, said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you miss Reynolda House?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t miss going in there at seven in the morning sometimes for breakfast for some teachers and staying through until ten o&#8217;clock at night when we had lectures.&#8221;  I mean it really is the most stimulating&#8212;  the big thrust there was relating the art to the literature and to the music of the times.  So I really learned a lot that I didn&#8217;t know about American history and American music.  I know when working the crossword puzzle yesterday it was something, some composer, and it was Ned Rorem.  I would never know Ned Rorem.  I said, &#8220;Thank you Reynolda House.&#8221;  Because I got to know all these artists, I knew a lot of them but not the composers.  And of course I had taken a lot of English and I'd taken American literature.    But anyway, it&#8217;s still it was, still is a place to grow and use your brain, and I really liked that.  The fact that I was able to do that Examining our Prejudices, it just shows you where you are, if you have a belief, you can just sort of take it and make a difference wherever you are.  And today there are still some prejudiced people.  I work on that as far as being able to speak out and so forth.  LL:  Yeah, I was just going to ask what came after Reynolda House?  MN:  Uh, let&#8217;s see.  [After] Reynolda House, my husband had died.  I spend some time with my grandchildren.  I have three biracial grandchildren, and I really have enjoyed that, just spending time with them.  And helping them grow and I thought this summer &#8211; I have a five-year-old grandson that loves soccer.  So I took him out thinking that life is all good.  I hope it is.  I think maybe it is better.  I took him out to Wake Forest to soccer camp, which is every day from nine to one.  Well, I must say I took him.  He was the littlest one there, the blackest one there, the only black I saw in the whole place.  Left him with these hundreds of kids and thought, I think he&#8217;s going to be okay.  I believe they know how to treat him.  And they did, he had a wonderful time.  He was sitting there, and of course I&#8217;m thrusting all my feelings on him.    LL:  Right. And he was just fine.  MN:  He was great and they gave everyone that came a soccer ball with Wake Forest on it.  He was at it, right out to the field.  I know things have gotten better.  I thought that sort of shocked me to think here it is, 2012 and I&#8217;m still thinking this is going on.  I&#8217;m leaving this little sweetheart here, and [he] doesn&#8217;t have anybody.  But it worked out fine; he loved it and got along fine.  They loved him.  He made friends, and so I think kids are not seeing color.  It&#8217;s because of our age and what we went through that we still see it some.  I hope we don&#8217;t.  But it&#8217;s the way it is.    LL:  Well it sounds like from what we were talking about before that you are active in some political causes from time to time.  So that keeps you busy as well.  MN:  Yeah, I&#8217;m very active in Democratic party.  Just thrilled about Barack Obama.  I was reading the paper today that one of the questions they asked people to answer was, &#8220;What do people think about Barack Obama?&#8221; A lot of people write in still and they say the reason they don&#8217;t like him is because he&#8217;s African American.  I hate to think of that, but it&#8217;s probably true.  I was thrilled, I mean he&#8217;s just a good person.  He is a good person and I hope he gets elected again.  LL:  Yeah, absolutely.  You were just talking about views and prejudices that might still exist or how children are somehow in some ways immune from a lot of that.  But do you see changes today in the ways that, are there things today that are easier, is it easier to achieve social change today than you think it was say in the 1960s?  MN:  Oh heavens yes because&#8212;  LL:  Or are there ways in which it&#8217;s more difficult?  MN:  Well, I think just getting people together like those dialogue groups.  They never heard about how anybody else felt about anything.  And people have been with people.  As I said my first real friends were made through the Y, black friends, through the YWCA board.  People are with people all the time.  They work beside each other.  They sit in church beside each other.  All that.  It&#8217;s got to have made a change.  I think it&#8217;s just knowing people.  When you get to know people and their story, and that&#8217;s one of the things I work on a lot in our church.  Give us time to sit down and tell our story to each other.  And I've helped with that at Saint Paul&#8217;s Church.  We started about ten years ago what we called small groups, trying to get everybody in the church in a small group studying something and not just talking.  That&#8217;s how you really get to know people and I think that&#8217;s going to help more than anything is people knowing people&#8217;s story.  You read about how nobody ever knows their neighbors.  I feel like that&#8217;s terrible.  I hope you know your neighbors.  Do you?    LL:  I do.  MN:  Knock on the doors and get to know them.  Anybody that comes into the neighborhood I immediately go up there and take them something and welcome them to the neighborhood.  I might not see them that much again, but still, at least they know there&#8217;s a person there that&#8217;s glad to have them here.  LL:  Absolutely.  Is there anything else you want to add or anything you wanted to talk about?  MN:  I think I've said it all.  LL:  I think that&#8217;s a great way to end, is the importance of dialogue, the importance of talking.  MN:  I do too.  LL:  Okay.  Well, I&#8217;ll call an end to the interview then.
