Speaker 1: Okay, and where did she come from?  Was she from Texas too?
Speaker 2: Right there in Texas.  See, see we right on the county line, Rusk County and Gregg County, see they--and so it was just from--backwards and forward from Rusk County to Gregg County, Rusk County--we stayed right on the county line.  Our farm on the Rusk County line and the Gregg County line is on the north side.  See, we was on the south side of the, and we right, come right down through our field, the line.  That was our, our line post, the county line.

Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother's family.  She was on, she was on, on the Rusk County side.
Speaker 1: Okay, had they been there a long time?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess they been there all their lives.  They had farm all up on both sides of the highway from Longview to, to Henderson there.  They sold the, the place for white folks to have a cemetery and a church called Ellaville, Ellaville--.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't spell it now.  I'm kind of tangled up on that Ellaville, it's been so long (laughter), Ellaville, that's--and so they moved that store out of there when, after they put the airport in there, along with Gregg County Airport, Ellaville.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know very much about your mother's family and what they--?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother's--on my, my daddy's, on my mother's side, her daddy [Hammond Harris] and his daddy [Hammond Carver], and his wife [May Parker Carver], and all of his sons.  He had two wives, had, had four boys and one girl.  That was by his first wife.  My mother was the oldest one.  She had four brothers, and the first wife.  Then he married another lady, and I guess he had about nine or ten kids by her, my grandfather.  Then his father, see, stay right on county line.  You just walk right across the street, across the road, and you in the, on the county line.
Speaker 1: Right on the line, huh?
Speaker 2: Right on the line, see.  He stayed in Gregg and Rusk County, and the county line right across the road in front of his house.
Speaker 1: So they were farmers basically and ranchers.
Speaker 2: They was farmers and ranchers or whatever thing, and cotton, cotton growers.  And he had a cotton mill and everything.
Speaker 1: Had they been there since slavery days?
Speaker 2: Well, that was back, I guess it must have been cause they was there when I was born.  They was still--my grandfather had a, had a cotton gin there.  And see, they built it, they went in with the white folks and built the gin down the--about a block from his house, about a mile from his house.  And the gin burnt down, about a couple of years, the gin burnt down, so then they taken my grandfather's land cause he had it up, up, you know, for security for the, to help build this cotton gin.  See, he had a cotton gin of his own, but he went with the white folks and so the gin got burnt down in about a couple of years after that.  I went to both of 'em, his gin and the, and the new gin too.  And the gin got burnt down at this little ole store Ellaville.
Speaker 1: Now, this, that's impressive, he had his own cotton gin.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he had his own cotton gin.
Speaker 1: What was his name?  What was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Hammond Harris.
Speaker 1: Hamilton?
Speaker 2: Hammond Harris, that was on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: What was--how do you spell that, his name?
Speaker 2: I, I can't--.
Speaker 1: The last name?
Speaker 2: Kind of down behind on spelling too good.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, what kind of person was your mother?  I mean what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, as far as I know she was a wife, a midwife, and everything.  She helped raise babies into the world.  She did that.  She was one of them midwives and she did that.  She--outside of that, I don't know.
Speaker 1: People didn't go to doctors, babies (simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Well, most of the time, out there in there country, what I know of, see they'd, people would come, come get her at night, you see, something like that, white and black.  They'd come get her at night, and she'd go visit, and if anything she couldn't do, well, then she'd have 'em to go get the doctor, see out in the country.  See, this is out in the country.  And so she, the doctor come and take care of 'em, like that, and then she'd help dress the babies and things like that, see.  Yeah, that was her, that was her trade.
Speaker 1: That sounds important to me.  I mean it's like--.
Speaker 2: Well, back in that time, I imagine it was cause that's what she did, see.  Then she, see she was married another man before she married my daddy [Jim Pettie].  And they was, something come up, she killed him.  My mother killed her first husband.
Speaker 1: So what happened?  What was the story?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know what the squabble was.  They was, they say they had been to a dance on a Saturday night, and he came from town and picked them up from the dance and went home and some way another they got to squabbling and going on like that.  And he just kept on after her, and so she went out--it must have been in the summertime cause she went out on the porch.  It was a old case knife laying on the shelf out there, and, and so she--they say she said, I'll cut your guts out.  He said, well, cut 'em out.  And so she cut his guts out.  So when the doctor got there, he was trying to hold 'em in.  So he died.
Speaker 1: Well, did she get in trouble for that?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, she--I don't know how much time she got there in Longview.  They put her in Longview jail.  See, they had her trial out there at this ole place I call Ellaville.  So they taken her--see that was in the Gregg County.  And so they brought her Longview.  And they put her in jail in Longview.  And they kept her in jail till, till the baby [Christ Johnson] was born.  And see and everybody, the white womens, said, every woman ain't got no business being in jail with no newborn baby.  She need to be out where she can take care of herself.  And so they passed a law right then that no woman in jail in Texas, when she have a baby they turn her a loose, prisoner or just at the little ole county jail or something like that, they turn them loose.  That's the law there in Texas now.  They don't keep no lady in jail with a newborn baby.  They turn 'em out.
Speaker 1: So how did she and your father meet?
Speaker 2: Well--.
Speaker 1: Do they have a story about how they met or anything?

Then I went back to East Texas, and I stayed there till '31 [1931] and '32 [1932].  Well, I came back to West Texas in '31 [1931] cause the man [Ed Turner] owed me some money.

Speaker 2: Oh, I was just, just a runt, just running around.  Everybody liked me, everybody liked, see me, they liked me and wanted me to be with 'em.  See, those white folks out there in the country out there, in Longview, they, just like I said, this white lady, I spent the night with her every Friday night.  And then I spent the night with a colored lady every Saturday night.  Her ole man go off somewhere on a Saturday night.  I'd go there, spend the night with her.  They come get me and take me around, go fishing, take 'em, come by and get me and go fishing and everything like that with a--the ole mens.

Speaker 2: I guess so, company.  I was just a little ole kid, just four, five or six years old.  That was in nineteen, right after my died, 1921, 1922.  See, I'd go fishing with 'em.  They'd come by and the ole man on a Saturday some time, and can he go fishing with me?  Yeah.  And, boy, I'd get on a boat and ride a boat.  I never had rode a boat before.  So I got--up and down the Sabine [River] there in Longview, right out of Longview there, fishing, back in there.

I'd drive the horse with the buggy and things like that, just a kid, just--through the summer, you know, when summertime.  And so that's the reason I say his wife always come get me on a Friday and spend the night with her, see.  He'd go off somewhere on a Friday night, and so, they'd come and get me.  And so a lot of times she'd be with us, and then they got 'em a ole T-model car [Ford Model T Roadster].  And I'd set in his lap and guide the car down the road.  See, that, that's where--with him and his wife had a T-model Roadster.  And we'd be in this ole car, and I'd be sitting in his lap guiding the car.  He'd, that's the way I learned how to drive.

Speaker 1: Just one more thing before we get out of your childhood, and I just wanted to ask you what kind of things your parents taught you that you can remember and, or anybody else.  If you had some teachers that had good instructions for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I had to obey everything.  I couldn't--if they tell me not to do nothing, I better not do it.  Rules and regulations, I had to do what they said do.  I, not get out of line, try to fight or doing like that and things like that, un-un, let that go.
Speaker 1: Were they pretty good rules?
Speaker 2: Well, they must have been, I, I obeyed 'em.  I didn't, if they tell me not to do something, I better not do it.  I guess the rule was pretty good.  Yes, if the ole man [Jim Pettie] tell me, don't you do that.  Don't you go so and so.  You stay here today.  I'd stay.  I'd stay till he come back.  Then when he come back, and then--but if he say, yeah, you can go, I could go.  But if he didn't say I could go, I couldn't go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, on a Sunday my, my three sisters and I, after we got up, see, we go to church.  See my, my grandfather [Hammond Harris] on my mother's [Dollie Pettie] side, he had a church named Harris Chapel.  He had that on his farm till later years after my mother died, they moved his church off my grandfather's farm over across the river, across the creek.  The ole creek and everything is right there, and the church is still there now.  And we'd get up in the morning, get up Sunday morning, my sisters and I would get in the wagon, and go to church, come back.  But we had to be back before, before the sun go down.  That's, that's, that was rules.  When the sun go down, you be inside this yard.  You couldn't be outside the yard at, at dark.  And so, now, we'd go anywhere in that wagon we wanted to on a Sunday, me and my three sisters, but when that sun went down, we better be back at that house with them mules taken out, turned a loose.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have a time when you didn't make it?
Speaker 2: No, no.  We never had a time like that.  We, we made every time right cause we had to look up at the sun, and, and we'd take off.  We'd take off.  We'd be the first one at the church and the first to leave, at them churches this time of year.  When that sun go down, we better be back at the house, and that's any time, through the week or any time.  When that sun go down, we better be in that yard.

Speaker 2: His father.  Yeah, well, he's over--his old lady, his wife, Aunt May Parker, Aunt May Parker, that was, that was my great, my grandfather's father's wife, May, May Parker Carver.  May Parker Carver, now, she--that old lady lived, I guess she must have, she died way back up in the '50s [1950s] I think.  I think she died in the '50s [1950s].  I wasn't down in that part of the country at the time.  But I think she died in the '50s [1950s].  She lived a long time too, didn't she?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 18966
Speaker 1: I wanted to know if your father--if you great grandfather [Hammond Carver] passed down any stories from slavery to you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he come out, they come out of slavery.  See, they come out of slavery.  And that's when they met these women.  He married--well, he had, my grandfather [Hammond Harris], he, he come out of slavery too with his, with his daddy, see.  He brought this son out.  He had a son, and I don't whether he had a daughter, a daughter or not.  But I know he came out, and he got married to this, this here, this old lady that I was telling you about, May, May Parker [Carver].  He married her.  And then they had some kids.  They had some kids.  Now, one of the boys, well, this, this, one of their grandsons, he lived right over there in the next room, next apartment here.  He died here a couple--three or four years ago.  Now, he was--this old man they had--he had four girls, I think four girls and one boy, my great, great grandfather did.  And so, and after, after he come out of slaves, see, he married this lady.  And then this lady what he married, she had one daughter.  That's when they come out of slaves.  She had one daughter and he had one boy.  And they growed up four girls and one boy, see.  Now, this lady that, his, first, what I call that, would be his stepdaughter.  Yeah, this old lady would be his--she married a guy named Stoker, a Stoker, this old lady, Martha Stoker.  Now, see that--Martha Stoker, she had, my--the lady that raised my brother [Johnny Earl Pettie].  See, my--her and my, my mother [Dollie Pettie] was good friends together.  See, they come up together see.  And see, that she told her to keep my, keep her baby after she died, see, if she died to keep her baby.  So that's the way--and so we was all right, right there on the Rusk County line--that's on the--they's on the Gregg County line, see, and the Rusk County line.  And all of 'em was on the Rusk County line.  And--.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry, would you--
Speaker 2: --that long in, in Ellaville, this little place Ellaville Store, see that was in, in Gregg County, but see, but they stayed in Rusk County.  But see, they--anything happen they take 'em back over there on the Gregg County side and have they trial (laughter) at this little ole store, little ole store, about, I guess it was what you call a warehouse store, big ole long building where the post office and everything was right in there.  You go in and buy whatever you want to, in this little, called Ellaville.  And that thing stayed there for years and years.  That was way before I, when I can remember.  See, that's the reason I say they moved my grandfather's cotton gin, just like here, moved it back a couple of blocks down the road from there on the same side of the street.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what I wanted to--what I was trying to get back--well, I want to get back to your great grandfather's stories, did he tell you any stories about what life was like during slavery or any stories about--(simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Well, nah, nah, nah.  He never, if he did, I didn't remember.  I was too young to think about it, but I'd go to see him.  I remember my mother taking me down there and stay, spend the night and whatever, and things like that.  But we didn't talk anything about slavery back at that--.
Speaker 1: Okay--.
Speaker 2: All I know, they come out of slavery.  That's all I--.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you have--?
Speaker 2: Then my grandfather, he never, he never talked to me about slaves back, no more than--see after, he married his second wife and all them kids was older than me.  See, all of his second wife kids was older than me, see.  And so I--and they, I think he about nine--I know he had four girls in the, in the last, in the last marriage.  He had four girls and about six boys in his last marriage.  My, my grandfather did.  And his first wife, he had, just had four boys and one girl, see, he had five kids.  So that--they didn't talk about anything like that too much for kids at that time.  You had to learn this the hard way, see.
Speaker 1: And why do you think that's that they didn't tell kids about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  They just didn't, didn't talk about it much.  See, you hear from other peoples around about.
Story_ID: 18967
Speaker 1: My mother [Dollie Pettie] and things like.  Yeah, and my mother go to, up to her daddy's [Hammond Harris] farm whenever we go over there and spend the night and everything; go back and everything went smooth.  And after, after my mother died, my daddy [Jim Pettie], we'd go up there and spend the night with, with my mother's daddy, and he'd go up there and spend the night with him in summer, yeah, a lot of times, cause we, maybe we'd go somewhere else and spend the night.  And he'd go up to my, up to my grandfather's and spend the night, my daddy would because he had big boys and everything up there.  You know, they was all grown then, but he'd go up there and they'd go hunting and things like that, and be around together, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they all got along good.
Speaker 2: They were pretty, a pretty close family?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, a close family.
Story_ID: 18968
Speaker 1: Now, in 1928, you went to West Texas with Mr. Turner.
Speaker 2: Turner.
Speaker 1: You used to work on his place?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I read that--.
Speaker 2: His name was Ed Turner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ed Turner, out there in West Texas, stayed out to a little place called Odell, Texas, Ed Turner.
Speaker 1: Now, he taught you some things that you had to know about rodeo riding?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, see, they--all his brothers, see, he had a, he had three or four brothers, see, he had seven brothers.  See, they--well, one of them was just a little older than I was.  We kind of growed up together there, the baby boy.  And so we do rodeo and the cattle and all, head all them cattle and all them horses and things like that, you see.  I, I'd be around one of 'em, you see, out there on the farm, riding them horses and cows and having fun out there with 'em, you see, yeah.  Now, see, now, Ed Turner, now he was, he was in World War I.  See, he was a--then he had another brother, he was in World War I, see, older than him, you see.  But, but he, but the other boys, they was just rousting around there, you see.
Speaker 1: What kind of things did you learn about horses and bulls and livestock when you were there?
Speaker 2: Well, it ain't much to learn about cattle, no more than just feed 'em and drill around, take 'em around to different places, sell 'em and things like that, dipping 'em in these dipping vats and things like that, you know.  And just, just raise 'em, just like you do dogs and puppies and things like that.  They just, just one of them things out there in, out there on the farm.
Speaker 1: I guess I'm really talking about riding them.  Now, you learned how to ride--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, I learned how--well, see, I was riding, riding before I went out there.  See, way back in the '20s [1920s] I'd be out there with those white boys and things.  We out there on a Saturday, it's black and white.  We out there in the, in the pasture, big, big pasture.  We didn't call it a ranch or nothing like that, had a great big place for the cattle and horses all to get out there.  And we, peoples have their cows and horses and everything out there.  And we'd go out there and have fun with them horses on a, on a Sunday, have fun.  See, you'd have a bunch of horses out there, a bunch of cow; this fellow have a bunch of cows out there; this fellow have a bunch of 'em.  And we just go out there and round them bulls up and ride on them cows and make us a rodeo out there, out there in the farm--out there in the, in the pasture.  We didn't have no rater or nothing like.  We just go out there and run 'em down and ride 'em and we all be out there together, white and black is out, where I was from.  Now, see a lot of places didn't do that, but just where I was at.  They had a little ole place called Ellaville, right out there in the Gregg County line.  Now, they didn't do all that over in the Rusk County line as I know anything about.  But I know we did over there in the Gregg County line.  See, me and them white boys and things girls and all, we'd be out there, my sisters and all, we'd be out there and having a big time out there in the, out there in, in the bottom, in the field out there where the pasture was, them cows on a Sunday evening.  See, we come from church and, yeah.
Speaker 1: So that was a source of--(simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's just for kids.  That's just a kid outfit, you know, kids growing up.
Story_ID: 18969
Speaker 1: Then after they get up some size, then they started separating, the girls and the boys, the white boys and the, and the girls start--couldn't be round with the--now, the boys would be round with the colored girls, not the--but you couldn't be round with the white, you see, you--the white girls.  And coming up a little fellow, then you all play together, but after you get certain age, then the white girls off to they selves and the black--
Speaker 2: So what would happen if you didn't follow that rule?
Speaker 1: Well, we'd get a beating.  We had to follow the rules, rules and regulations.  See, everybody had to do the--obey.  No fighting, no squabbling, and going on like that out there, see.  And everybody got along good together, see.  Sometime, you might, some, some--the boys might want to get smart with you, but you leave him and let him go, get away from him.  See, he get smart with you, just go on home or go somewhere, yeah, like that.  And then later he'll come back to you, y'all start playing again.  But when he go to wanting to act up and wanting to, gonna get smart, well, leave and go on home or, or make him go on home or something.
Speaker 2: And that seemed fair to you?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Did that seem fair?
Speaker 1: Well, if he, if he gonna do right, if you, you get smart with a person with a person like that, now, you go, go on home, see.  Or either I go home.  If I'm at his house, I go; if he gets smart with me, I go home to keep from fighting, like that, see, like, things like that, yeah.  Y'all play together and then all of a sudden you gonna start to fighting each other.  If you didn't, that white man would make you go home anyhow.  He said, go on home, yeah.
Speaker 2: Sir, you were describing the sort of informal rodeos that you all had as a, when you were young?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, kids, just kids, a bunch of kids get together on a Sunday, white and black, you know, out there, out there in the field see.  We just grab up some of them old bulls or cows or, and like that, calves, and like that and ride 'em out to have fun, see, like that.
Speaker 2: So what other things did you all do to have fun?
Speaker 1: Well, this time of year, we go in swimming together, me and the white boys.  We go in swimming and have fun together like that, just the boys, no girls; didn't allow no girls around with us.  So we could get off together and, and go in a pond and have our self a regular place where we'd go and swim, see; play out there in the water.  See, we didn't have no swimming suits on.  We just go out there (laughter) natural (laughter), jump out in there.  See, no girls around us, like that.  And then, then a lot of times, be nothing but colored boys, all colored boys out there swimming and things like that.  And be, cause wasn't no white around, see.  But a lot of times, if it's through the week, now we get together and we, we all out there fishing and going on, swim together in ponds and things like that, yeah. Everything went on smooth.  Everybody got along good together, in a way.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just wanted to ask you about the age when everybody seemed to separate, you know, when you said that--.
Speaker 1: Well, that's when the--.
Speaker 2: --at a certain they--.
Speaker 1: Well, when they get upper age, you see, after the girls, and girls and the boys get up a little older, then, then we start to pulling away from one another, see.  See, the white boys, he couldn't play with the colored girls, and the, and the colored boys couldn't play with the white girls, so like, we divide up.  But long as we little ole fellow, five or six, seven years old, and like that, we'd play together, maybe ten something like, we'd play together, see.  And, but we get a certain age, then they start to separating us.
Speaker 2: Now, do you know anybody that ever got in trouble for not respecting that line or following those rules?
Speaker 1: Well, back in that time I don't remember none of the boys and, got into any trouble like that no kind of way.  Back in there, the girls or boys or nothing, see.  They all, especially out there in the country.  See, we was out in the country.  We wasn't in town.  See, town is different than the country, see.  And we just all was born there, out there where we used to have this Easter egg hunt, see.  And we'd go rag ball playing and all like that.  Now, this fellow right across the road from us, he didn't allow his girls to come over there and play with us.  He had four girls.  He didn't have no boys.  Say they was around, some over to his--around about my age, you see, and then older, and, but he didn't allow 'em to play with us.  But them other kids come right through his field, come over there and play with us on a Sunday.  Then after my mother [Dollie Pettie] died, then they cut that.  Then my oldest sister [Bertha Johnson] left home, then we didn't have it no more.  We didn't no more of them Easter egg hunts.
Story_ID: 18970
Speaker 1: We had five or six hundred hens on the yard land at one time.  And that's a lot of eggs, you know.  The kids have fun on a Saturday.  So we'd get all the eggs the hen lay on a Saturday, see.  The old man [Jim Pettie] take the eggs to town through, what they had laid through the week, and see, my mother [Dollie Pettie] would be there, and have that Easter egg hunt.
Speaker 2: Did you color the eggs or--?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, they'd color 'em.  They'd color 'em.  They colored with something.  I don't know what they colored them with, but they'd color 'em.  And we'd have, we'd have fun, you know, on Sunday.  Boy, and the girls, them kids take home eggs, a dozen eggs or done eggs and raw eggs and everything else.  People let they kid come over there cause they could get some eggs for, for Sunday morning breakfast, to get free eggs, didn't cost 'em nothing.  See, they let them kids come over there and they, they want a dozen, say, mama say give us a dozen eggs, send her a dozen eggs.  Give her a dozen eggs or five or six eggs and how many is in the family, you give 'em a egg a piece for breakfast, like that, see.  And then after--plus, them there what's already done, them, them Easter eggs, see, that be already done.  But them there be raw eggs, they take them and have 'em for Sunday morning breakfast, see.  And then if they wanted some syrup or something like, some sopping syrup or ribbon cane syrup, we had all that there; say send us, they, they bring a jar over there, about like that, cork it and fill it up with syrup and take over so they can have breakfast in the morning.  See, they didn't have no syrup or they had to go buy it, see; you get free over there.  So ole man, he had a fifty-gallon barrel with syrup in it, a forty-gallon can with syrup in it, all kinds of buckets, all kinds of anything you put syrup in, he'd have it, see.  And they want some syrup?  Give 'em a little something for breakfast in the morning, a pint jar or something like that, just enough for breakfast in the morning, egg.  And if they wanted some butter, if we had, had some butter left, the ole man didn't take it, we'd give 'em a little piece of butter, see, let 'em, let 'em have that for breakfast in the morning, syrup and butter.
Speaker 2: Do you think this made the neighborhood a lot happier, you know, when--?
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it must have been, all the kids around there but this one man, he didn't let his kids come over there, him and his wife didn't let kids come.  The ole man, I guess if it wasn't for him, that the lady would, but, but the boys, the ole man wouldn't, man, wouldn't let 'em come over, but all the rest of the kids come right through the cornfield, take, take 'em some eggs home or butter or something.  And, and then the onlyest time I ever heard a white person call a black person Miss Pettie, now that's what they called my mother, Miss Pettie, all the white kids and all, the boys and all called her Miss Pettie and Mr. Pettie.  But I never heard that word before after, after my mother died.  The kids come over there and say, Miss Pettie, mama say send her so and so or let her have something.  We got some--or come over there or something like that.  She wanted my mother to make a dress for 'em or cut out a dress or something, make something for 'em, yeah.  See, see my mama was a jack of all trades, see.
Speaker 2: And she made your, all your clothes?
Speaker 1: All my clothes.  Them girls' clothes, my clothes, cause when she take a--see, them ole flour sacks, them ole--she take them ole flour sacks and make the girls underskirts and pants and whatever what off them ole big flour sacks, forty-eight pound sack and different things.  They buy cloth and things like that.  She cut 'em up and make, make kids' clothes.  And they, lady have her buy some cloth and tell my mother to come over there.

And so white, so she go over there to cut 'em out and make, make nice dresses for 'em to wear to school and to play in or whatever they was, yeah, up until she died, yeah.  She had a sewing machine.  She kept, we kept that sewing machine for I don't know how many years after my mother died.  I don't know whatever happened to that sewing machine, big, ole tall something, she had.
Speaker 2: Was that the kind with the foot pedal?
Speaker 1: Yeah, foot pedal.
Story_ID: 18971

Speaker 2: Nah, 1920--.
Speaker 1: That's why I'm asking you so many details--.
Speaker 2: 1920, 1918, and 1917, after I got up big enough to, yeah, she did.  Out in the country, we, she didn't pay no attention.  We had them country balls.  I remember, I remember my mother [Dollie Pettie] and them, sisters and them having them, them dances before my mother died.  She, it was a big, all, everybody'd come and her uncle, see, he'd have a place there.  And he had a place, big house, and a little old store, and we'd go there on a Saturday night, see.  And you didn't have to go about far from here to the five point, we'd get in the wagon.  The ole man [Jim Pettie] take us up there in the wagon, my mother.  We'd go up there and have a big ball up there on a Saturday night.  The kids, they have a big room like this here, great big room and, and blankets on the floor, quilts on the, and the kids go in there laying down on the floor, and the other peoples be in there dancing till time to go home about eleven, 12:00 o'clock at night on a Saturday night.

Speaker 2: Oh, they have piano.  They had a piano, a guy played the piano, play the guitar.  It was mostly guitars and pianos.  They didn't have no, no drums too much then.  But guitars and old, a ole fiddle and things like that, and the piano or organ.  They wouldn't say, have to say a piano, organ, back in that time.  In later years, they got a, a piano.  See, my uncle bought him a piano.  He had a organ and a piano, see.  And so they'd have, have a big, big ball there on a Saturday night.  He had the little ole--they was selling this here, this--what's that ole stuff they used to sell?  Ooh, what they call that stuff?  Ooh, it's some kind of drink.  It was a drink, see.

I forget the name of it, but anyhow they, they'd have that stuff there and the old peoples drink it, you see.  They didn't allow--a kid might get just a little sip of it, a little, but not too much of it.  And what was it, root beer or root--something, something, but anyhow they, they did drink that stuff.  They'd make it and drink it.
Speaker 1: Did it taste like root beer or was it--?
Speaker 2: It was some kind of strong--it was a strong drink.  It'd make you, I done forgot now what that stuff was, but anyhow, they sold it.  They sold that stuff there on--I forget the name of that stuff, what they, they'd have it there.  But anyhow they, they sent it to the old folks, you know, the guys drink it, you know, but the kids couldn't, couldn't drink it.

Speaker 2: Well, different kinds.  Some of them had good clothes on.  Some of 'em had just ole regular overalls and things like that.  They had just clothes, just like they got now in a way, but back in that time they had more overalls and things like that, you know, for, for the black, you know, to wear, see.  But they got pants, different kinds of pants, different colors, different kinds of shirts and, and they had some nice looking shirts back in them time, man.  Them guys used to have some nice-looking shirts, fixed up for, for Sunday.  Oh, yeah, beauty--beautiful shirts for Sunday, nice blue pants and gray pants and black pants and all like that.  They, they'd dress up.  Some of 'em have on suits and things.  They, they be dressed--it depend on how the, the condition they was in, what they did.  And see that was on a Saturday night.  See, that'd be at my, my mother's uncle's house.  See, at my mother's uncle's house.
Speaker 1: And he was pretty well off I guess--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was pretty well off.  See, then, then in later years, he, he bought a--well, he had a farm back down the road about a couple of miles, but he didn't, they didn't build no house down there.  I don't know why.  And then someway or another, he traded some of the bottom land for some, for eighty acres of the top land, right there.  And then he built him a house there.  He built that house, I guess that's, oh--let's see, that was back in nineteen--1914, he was building that house.  He built a big house there, great big, six-room house.  Then he had him a little ole store on the back, a little ole place, a room back there in the back, the store.  Now, they'd be at his house, they would have a singing class, these songs, learn how to sing.  My sister [Pearl Pettie], oh, she, she, ooh, she was the greatest singer, my oldest sister was.  And, and this guy, one of my cousins he teach singing, the notes and everything.  He taught, taught the notes and everything, dah, dah, ooh, ooh, all like that.  He, he, and at my uncle's house on a Saturday night.  Then after the, after they have the little class, then they have this, this dance over here in this other big room, where the piano and all that.  Now, he played piano.  This guy played, played the piano too.  He'd teach time girls how to sing and them guys how to, how to sing, different notes and things like that.  And then after that, they go over there and have a big dance till around 12:00 o'clock.  Twelve o'clock, that was their deadline, everybody had to go home.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the songs?  Can you sing a few lines of the songs?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--I can't--I know my sister used to sing the, 'It's Heaven to Me, Wherever I May Be'.  And boy, she could really sing that song, oh, she could sing that song.  That's about the main song.  And the people--I remember the last time she sung that song was 1924 at the church at my grandfather's [Hammond Harris] church [Harris Chapel].  My daddy had, she was sick, they left when her baby was first born, her first child was born.  And, and she there at church, and they want--and the peoples just fell out to hear her sing that song.  Yeah, they, they just loved to hear her sing that song.
Story_ID: 18972
Speaker 1: She [Pearl Pettie] was sick when she sung it ['It's Heaven to Me, Wherever I May Be'].  And that's the last time I seen her, at--sung that song on a Sunday, and when the--her and my oldest sister [Bertha Johnson], my half sister, they left and went back up there where, back up there at Overton [Texas], around Tyler, back up in there, and so she lived to November.  She died that November.  Her baby was born in, in January.  And so she died in, in November in '24 [1924], my oldest sister.  I didn't even go to the funeral cause I, cause when I know'd it, she was dead and buried.  See, when, when it got to me down at Longview, see, see, news ain't like it is now.  See, back in that time, it was kind of slow; somebody had to tell you, see.
Speaker 2: So that's, that's--you had a pretty rough time with relatives.  I mean your mother [Dollie Pettie] died in 1919, and your oldest sister dies in 1924.  Your father [Jim Pettie], 1926.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, yeah, yeah.  So, and then, see, my half sister, she died in, in 1980-something.  She died in the '80s [1980s], my, my mother's oldest sister [sic, daughter].  She was right at a hundred years old when she died.  She died there in Dallas.  I went to the funeral.  I was, I as living here.  I went, I went to her funeral down in Dallas.  Yeah, she was right at a hundred years--she was ninety-nine I think they said, something like that.
Story_ID: 18973
Speaker 1: It's time now to talk about the rodeo now, how you got involved in the rodeo--?
Speaker 2: Well, with the white guy.  See, I worked with these people out there in West Texas.  See they, the younger boy, he was a clown, he was a clown, see.
Speaker 1: Ed Turner's people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ed Turner's people, see.  He was a clown, see.  Then this other guy, he was, he was something in there, the other brother was older than him, he was something in there.  And then Ed was something in the rodeo there.  And so we all got to working together.  See, then, see, then I wasn't in the contests, but I could ride the exhibition ride, you see.  Now, I could ride a bull.  I could ride a bareback horse.  See, a bull was two dollars.  A bareback horse was three dollars, a saddle horse was five dollars.  And I used to ride as many of them as I wanted to, as exhibition.  See, I couldn't ride in the contest, but I could ride in the exhibition.  The colored couldn't, see, and I was the onlyest colored guy out there with 'em, see, all white.  And so I, and this, the baby boy, he was a clown.  He'd be the clown with the, the cows and things out there on, on the rodeo.  You see how the clown do and that.  And then they start them, them Brahman bulls, in later years.  See,  the Brahman--didn't have no Brahman bulls then.  They had all ole, just old, it was Texas longhorns.  They used to call it Texas longhorns.  That's what they used then.  But in later years, that, that Brahman bull come in.  They shipped him from overseas over here, brought--.
Speaker 1: Brahman is India, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, brought him over here, the Brahman, and started them like that.  See, them Brahman bull is much faster and, and quicker than a, than a regular old Texas bull, see, the Texas longhorn, the ole Texas bull.  And boy, they had horns on, oh, three foot long.  They said some up here last year.  I was, I didn't see none this year cause I wasn't at the parade up there this year.  And they called me to Texas, so and I, I worked with those peoples out there on, on the--but I, I'd go there on a Saturday, I'd make more money on a Saturday and Sunday than I make all the month.
Speaker 1: Just riding the bulls and horse?
Speaker 2: Bulls.  I'd saddle ride me two bulls--two horses, bareback horses.  I didn't have to ride 'em, you just ride out there and jump off of 'em and go back and get me three dollars, go back and get me another one and ride him, and get me three dollars.  The bulls come out, I'd ride me a bull; I get two dollars.  Go back and get me another one, and ride another one.  See, that's four dollars, that's, that's ten dollars I done made.  I wouldn't be making but fifteen dollars a, a month.  Fifteen back, it was twenty, twenty-eight, and twenty-nine, and so.  And that's Saturday and Sunday.  You do that twice, twice a week, look what you done made.  If you make you, say, six dollars Sunday and six, or six dollars Saturday, and six dollars Sunday, that's twelve dollars.  That's, that's one day, that's two days.  Now, you got a whole, whole month to go before you get fifteen more dollars off your job, and you do that every Saturday, see, especially this time of year.  That's every Saturday clear up until it get cold in, in November.  They have that rodeo, exhibition rodeo.  That was in the white, do that, out there, out there in West Texas.
Speaker 1: Were there any other black cowboys making that kind of money out there, doing that--?
Speaker 2: Every once in a while, some in the fall of the year, some come out from down in Houston, San Antonio, back down in there.  They'd come up there to have a few rides with 'em, you know, out there.  They could get some--ride a saddle horse, that's five dollars and bareback horse, three dollars, a bull two dollars, a mule one dollar, all that, just fun, see.  Just fun.  You didn't have ride 'em.  See, I was, I worked with 'em, so I got a chance to make that kind of money, but, but I was the onlyest back out there.  Now, they'd come out there to see the show, but they'd be--wasn't nobody in the rodeo but me.  Now, every once in a while, they--one might come in there and, and ride him a bull or a horse or something like that, but not regular as I was.  See, I was there every, every day, every Sunday and every Saturday.  See, I was out there with 'em cause I worked with the peoples that, you know, helped with the rodeo and things like that.

Speaker 1: You had sort of a bad incident to turn good in 1929 when you hurt your shoulder.  Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: In 1929?  Well, 1929--when I got this shoulder, I was out there.  See, we was having the, one of them Saturday rodeos, one of them Saturday outfits just like I tell you.  And see, and this, and this, this white fellow he was, he was a deputy sheriff.  And he was a cowboy too, see.  And something, I don't know, he come in there with this, this quart of whiskey, jug of whiskey like that and give it to us in there.  And we was all in there, and I had--there was another colored boy with me.  It was just--there was two of us that time.  He got hurt.  He got his foot hurt.  I think a cow or something kicked him on the foot there, hurt his foot.  And I got this shoulder knocked out of place, the same night.  And we out there drinking that stuff, see.  That was 1929, but it goes every Sunday, every Sunday and Saturday, it goes right on.  I got hurt, but I'd be up there.  But I didn't do no riding.  See, then after, after I got hurt, you see, till that arm got back the next year, '29 [1929], see.  That was in '28 [1928], see, '29, see, but I got this in the '30s [1930s].  No, I didn't--.
Speaker 1: So you didn't ride any more after you hurt your arm?
Speaker 2: Not, not for a while till it got back together.  See, it got--it was good, wasn't nothing, wasn't nothing wrong with it.  It, it come back good, and so I went on to that guy up there on till that guy up there on (unclear) up here smashed it and, then it went out.  Yeah, I was all with those guys out there West Texas.  I'd go in Oklahoma and had 'em, them rodeos Saturdays, me and this white fellow, we'd go in Oklahoma.

Speaker 1: Did you get involved in contests, you know, any of the--?
Speaker 2: Nah, nah, I never was in no contests or nothing like that.  I, no more than this here, the first contest I was in is down there at Longview, down at this place I call Ellaville, this black school, Greenville, Greenville, see, Greenville School, that--and this, this colonel, colonel, they had a rodeo there at, what's the name, what's this guy, he come in there--he married one of my cousins.  And he started a, kind of having a black rodeo down there.  And so that was back in the '30s [1930s], thirty-something, when he had, started this black rodeo.  But in '41 [1941], I was down there in Longview, and I went out there for this, this--it must have been Labor Day, during Labor Day something like that.  And I went off, out there in, and having that rodeo, and I, I rode this, this bull out there, the contest, the black, all-black rodeo was there.  Oh, there was white out there, but, but they, you know, they roped, you know, and things like that.  They, they was mixing a little bit in there, but they didn't work with the blacks.  See, they, see when the black had they outfit, then the white come in there and rope them calves and things like that.  It's like that, but the black they do their own roping and everything like that, and then they, then the white guys come in there to have them a little show there, the white guy roping calves and, and things like out there.  But that was the only thing down there, but out there at West Texas, it's no colored period out there, nothing but white, all white out there at West Texas and Oklahoma, see.

Speaker 1: Riding a bull or riding a bareback horse is dangerous, I know--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you may not have considered--I don't know if you considered it dangerous then, but I know you broke your pelvis in 1930, right?
Speaker 2: No, 1948.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what happened?
Speaker 2: That's the first black rodeo they ever had here in Denver [Colorado], 1948.  See, that's where I had the--me and the guy called [Willie] Smokey Lornes, him and I had a rodeo out here Sunday before Labor Day in 1948.  And so now I rode the horse all right.  I rode the horse.  Then when it come time to bull ride--see, that's the last of the show, putting the, here come the bull ride, and riding this bull.  Now, I rode the bull out there and something give away in my stomach.  I stepped off of him and sat down there.  And so the guy what's, what's wrong with, what's wrong with the cowboy?  What's wrong with the cowboy?  And he went out there and got me, and carried me over to the fence.  And, and I rolled up under the fence.  The fence is off the group about like that, see, out there.  And so I said--so finally my friend he come.  Mike say, what's the matter?  I said, man, I, I say, something busted this leg here.  And so, can you, can you get up?  And so finally they helped me up.  And I stood, can you walk?  No, I couldn't, couldn't stand to walk on the leg.  And so the, the boy went and got his truck.  He had a old T-model truck there, pickup, and he had it--and so him and I got, got in his truck and come on back to the highway over here on Colfax, right past Fitzsimmon [Army Hospital] there.  And I told him I said, I told him I say, this is far as I can go.  And then, I said, call the, call the, get a ambulance to come pick me up.  And so, so we pulled across the highway, Colfax, at a filling station and stayed there till the ambulance come.  And they come and got me and put me in the, in the ambulance and, and brought me on out to Colorado (unclear) out there, out there where Colorado Boulevard, and I stayed there Sunday evening, from that to November, to the last of November in '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: And what did they say was wrong with you?
Speaker 2: I busted this, the hip, the hip, busted my hip in here, yeah, I busted that hip.  It cracked, fractured that, that hip in there.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you stay--?
Speaker 2: I stayed in the hospital from, from September--from, from Labor Day to November, about, I'd say I got out long about, about the last of November in '48 [1948], got out the hospital, September, October, in November.  And I was living right up there on 39th and California Street.  That's where I stayed when I had that rodeo.
Speaker 1: Now, we're kind of ahead of ourselves, but since we're on the subject of injuries, what other kind of injuries have you had riding bulls and horses?
Speaker 2: Well, no more than see, that, that's--see, that I got that knocked there too.  That's when, when I, that, that bull then in forty--in '41 [1941], see.
Speaker 1: The knuckle.
Speaker 2: That knuckle, that, see, that, see that; got that knuckle.  See, I got that hurt.
Story_ID: 18977
Speaker 1: See, I ride with this, this left hand.  See, I ride with this, I ride with this left hand.  And so, see, like this here, see.  See, the guy told me, see when you riding a bull, you could, you do like this here.  You get right, just close up to that rope as you can.  You got a rope around, and you get right up there just as close as you can and bear down on this arm, bear down on your arm, hold that rope like that, just as tight as you can and just like that.  See, I used to practice that every day, to hold your hand, just--see, back in that time, it was ten seconds.  See, you need to hold your hand just as tight as you can, look at your watch, ten seconds, just hold your hand like that for ten second, just tight, just keep that up every day to work with, it would--see, and that'll get your hand loose where you can, can holder it longer, see.  Just hold it like that, ten seconds, just as tight you can get it.  Then when the whistle blow now, it's eight seconds, eight seconds.  They cut it back two seconds, eight second.  Now, you can bear down on this leg and all this is like this here.  Now, you ready.  When he come--the more you bear down on this leg, on this leg here and that arm, hold that on, pressure on it, and hold that rope, the better you can ride.  A fellow taught me that.
Speaker 2: But there's nothing on the bull at all.  You're bareback, right?
Speaker 1: You bareback, and that rope, just that rope across there.  And you got to, with that rope like this here, see, like this, and you got, see, to take that rope, pull it up and tighten it back and double it back over your hand like that.  Now, you see you holding it.  Now, if you let that robe go, get loose and come on off his back.  But, now, you, now, you ride with either hand.  See, I left--I use my left hand all the time.  They use it the same way.  But get that, get that rope, get right up on that rope, get just as close up to that rope as you can get.  And get that rope like that, and the guy said, ready, okay.  You tighten that hand up.  They open the gate.  Then you, the bull starts, then you start jumping and riding him, like that.  Oh, you got to take a little training you know, before you get that arm right, but you got to get right up on that rope, get right up as close to that rope from there and come right, hold it back and, and hold that hand just as tight as you can, and bear down on this, on this arm.  See, that holds you right to the, to the cow's hide.  And a ole cow's hide rolls, you know.  They, they, they skin rolls like that, see.
Speaker 2: Do you have to be strong to do that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty strong and have a good strong mind and a, to stay up there, cause boy they tough.  Them bulls, them brim--them Brahmans, oh, them some tough things.  And they, now, they make, got 'em fat, they done fattened 'em up, them great big ones.  And boy, and boy them things too is tough, is tough, see.
Speaker 2: Those are the kinds with the humps on their backs, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, with that little hump.  Yeah, you get that thing around there, them great big 'uns, man, say, so weight two thousand and some pounds, three thousand pound bull.  And boy and that thing jumping and twisting around, boy, they like a, like that.
Speaker 2: Sir, is there anything that you have to, is there anything that you can know about a bull or a horse to make it easier to ride them?
Speaker 1: Well, you can train, you can train them bulls down that you can ride 'em up and down the streets, if you, if you train him right.  If you train, tame 'em before they come up, coming up, pet him and feed him and everything.  And, and you can ride him up and down the streets; put a, put a bridle on him just like you do a horse.  They, they have 'em up--they used to have some up here from Texas up here.  They come up here and, and have 'em in the parade like that.  And, and they ride 'em, got a saddle on 'em and everything.
Speaker 2: But the ones that you rode were wild, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, them was, them was wild bull used to bring him right off the, off the ranch out there.  Yeah, they wild and, and full of, full of spirit, fight and everything else.  If they throw you off they back, they liable to hook with their horns, come back and hook you or do something.
Speaker 2: Is there anything that you can know about a wild bull or a wild horse that makes easier to ride?
Speaker 1: Making--ain't no way easy--ain't no easy way, way to ride a, a wild horse, no more than get on him and try to stay up there as long as you can, a wild horse.  Now, you can, you can keep a, ride him every day, you can tame him down, a horse, you can tame him down.  See, you can tame a horse down.  See, that's, I used to break horses like that, that out in Ok--we go over in Oklahoma from Texas and get these horses they got there, out there, them big wild horses.  We catch 'em, and we saddle 'em right there and ride 'em right, start right there on 'em.  And see, and I ride him and get him, get that hump out of, just say, get that hump out of his back.  He quit jumping and going on.  Then he'll come down, but you have to watch him cause he liable to start back to jumping again and you ride him a little bit.  You lala ride him from here to, to the corner up there, and he start to bucking again.  You still stick on him and he get somewhere, and he lala stay--now, he'll finally quit that.  See, he'll finally quit, then you kind of pat him there like that on the--and rub him up and down his neck like that, and pat him.  As long as you stay on him, and if you get bucked off, the next time it gonna, it gonna be different cause he gonna be bucking worser, but if you just keep, stay on him till you get him down quiet, and then you riding him, and we'd come out of Oklahoma, about a mile or mile and a half out of Oklahoma, come right to Texas, by the time I get back to Texas, I can get off of him and get back on him.
Story_ID: 18978
Speaker 1: You mentioned something real quick about catching wild horses and most people never, you know, haven't rode after a wild--(simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Well, you have to go out there and chase it--.
Speaker 1: --or chased after a wild horse--(simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: You have go out there and, and run him down and catch him and hem him up in a pen or something or drive him up in a, in a pen and catch him like that.  But he's wild.  He's ready to run off any time.  You throw a rope on his neck, and he, he'll run out.  Now, then, you can do this here.  To tame him down, you put a rope around his neck and run him against that run.  Say, you open the gates here, like that door, open that door there, and he over here, and have that rope around his neck, now he'll run and get that rope, that rope'll, if he don't break that rope, that rope'll snatch him back down.  Now, he ran up against that rope a couple of times, he won't run against it.  You can just throw this rope on top of his, top of his--like that, he'll stop.  Just throw it on top of his head, he'll stop and go put the bridle on him.  But before then, you, you can't get up to him because he's wild, he's, he's wild.  You go out there in prairie and catch him.  See, he's wild.  He, those horses out there, cause they don't never be around nobody.  They see you, you come out there and feed 'em, now, they'll go around you.  If you feed 'em, and they--but you try to catch them or try to ride or try, you know, he's tough.  And some of them fight, some of them horses, some of the horses, and the mare horse, well, she, you can tame her down much quicker than you can one of them studs, one of them studs.  Them studs is tough.  You go messing with a stud, boy, you better watch yourself cause he'll, he'll kill you, yeah.  Yeah, he'll kill you.  You got to be awful careful with him.
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen anyone hurt, you know--?
Speaker 2: Well, I seen 'em, seen 'em bit, you know, like that.  The horse bit 'em or something like that, you know, and trying to catch, but you got to be, be careful with that stud cause he--you might have to put a, a muzzle on him, put a muzzle over his mouth to keep him from, from biting you till you get trained down, them real bad ones, been there years sometime.  See, they, you start breaking these horses, when they get four or five years old.  And when they get four or five years old, they, they're pretty tough.  They tough, and they get older than that, they tougher than that.  The older they get, the worser they is, see.  And you trying to, trying to break him, boy.  And he'll, he'll eat you up.  And, see one of them studs, shoot, them studs'll eat you up.  They'll eat you up, boy.  You go out there messing around with them, boy, boy he'll run you out of that pen and bite you, man, and (laughter) stomp you.
Speaker 1: Have you ever been bitten by one?
Speaker 2: Nah, well, I got just a little nip, just a little, just a little nip.  And boy they sharper than a razor.  I know my daddy's [Jim Pettie] mule bit me once, boy, sharp as a razor.  I was put, I was hooking him up to the wagon.  He stretch back there and bit me on the--ooh, boy, that was that sorest place I ever seen, just, just, just nipped like that.  Boy, the, ooh, that thing hurt.
Speaker 1: Now, didn't a horse or something kick you in the stomach, in the navel or something?  I was reading that you got kicked in the navel or got hurt?
Speaker 2: Well, this, this navel, see, that saddle horn hit me there, a saddle.  See, I'm riding one of them, one of them wild horses around the house, and that, bucked into the wall over at the barn.  See, I was outside, and see, the, and he bucked into the barn.  See, where he bucked in the barn, see, quite like that, then he jumped back.  When he jumped back, that, that, that saddle horn hit me right there.  It caused--then when I got, got off of him, I went, and I told the man, I said look here, that, that thing hurt me here.  Well, it didn't, it, it stayed sore for a day or two.  Then it went away.  Then it just gradually, gradually come out.  Then it just got worser and worser, see.  And then, and I--so, now in Colorado Springs, they told me they'd operate on me when I got in the service, see.  It was still in there then.  It, but it was little, little tickle there.
Story_ID: 18979
Speaker 1: I got in the army, see, and it gradually started--the more I would move around, it, it a work out, see.  And so it got, so they tie it in.  See, they tied it in.  And, and so they said, well, we ain't gonna operate on it.  We'll operate on it when you get out.  And down, they sent me down from, from Fort Hood, Texas, sent me down in Louisiana, Camp Claiborne.  See, they taken that band away from around me.  See, I had a band around.  They wouldn't let me wear it down there in Louisiana, and every time I get off out there and go to jumping around, my navel run out.  Boy, if your navel run out, boy, you in bad shape, you in bad shape.  You, you put it back there.  You can't don't nothing, boy, that, ooh, just paralyze you almost.  And so, they sent me back to the doctor.  The doctor wouldn't, they wouldn't put no bandage.  Finally, they just kicked me out of the army, see.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, well, since you mentioned the army, I know you were in, you served in World War II, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you went in 1941?
Speaker 1: Forty-two [1942].
Speaker 2: Forty-two [1942], okay.  Well, tell us what happened to you?  When did you get drafted?
Speaker 1: Well, well, see down in Colorado Springs, see, that's when I tell you, see, when they--I had to go before the doctor.  See, they examined to see whether I was fit to go in the army or not.  And so when I got in there, the man said, you got a hernia at the navel.  He said, but they'll operate on you when you get in the service.  And so okay, so I went on in the service, went down, got in Texas.  So then when I got in there, that thing happened to come out, I went to doctor.  And it, said, no we ain't--I said, they said they gonna operate on me when I got here.  He said, nah, we ain't gonna operate on you.  We operate on you when you get out.  And that was in '42 [1942], and so he put a little band on it, put a tape on it, you know, held it.  And so then, see, I was, I was a, I was a truck driver too.  I drove trucks and all like that when I was civilian, had--and I had driver's license.  See, a lot of--at that time, a lot of guys didn't have driver's license.  See, I had driver's license back there.  And so they took, got me and started me to driving trucks, put me to driving trucks at the motor pool they had in Fort Hood.
Speaker 2: Okay, and did you ever serve overseas?
Speaker 1: Nah, I didn't go overseas, just down at Fort Hood, down there in Texas and, and Camp Claiborne, Louisiana.  And see, and I was, see, after I was in there, I worked for the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] in, and the MPs [military police] and things like that.  See, when the German prisoner come into town or the Jap [Japanese] prisoner come in there, see, I had to go to the railroad and get 'em in this big long truck.  I had a big, long cattle truck--well, I called it cattle truck, see.  But I had sides on it, you know.  I'd take it and put the sides on it and get some, some benches and set 'em in there.  And I'd go down to the railroad and pick up the German prisoners and, and bring 'em back to the camp.  And so then they'd take 'em to the, their place of business, where they'll stay, they camp, they part of the camp, see.  And they had a place for them to go and, the German prisoners and the, and the Jap prisoners.  Now, the Jap prisoners, they was on the north camp, over in the north side of the camp.  And so I had to go down there in the truck and get a big load of 'em, thirty or forty of 'em.  I went out there, if anything happens that I had to go get them to take 'em somewhere or something like that, see, at the motor pool.  See, I was overseer and the, maybe overseer of the grease and oil dock.  See, that was where you come and get your oil and your, get your car greased and things like that, see, get our oil, see.  And, and so I was overseer of that, all that.  Then your license; you had to come through me to get your driving license when I was in the army, there in Fort Hood.  If you didn't, see, even your motorcycle license.  See, I could ride a motorcycle when I went in.  And so a lot of guys didn't know how to ride motorcycles at that time back in, back in the forties [1940s], especially colored guys, see.  And so you had to come through me, to take care of business.
Speaker 2: Did you ever have any--well, what did you feel about the German prisoners and the Japanese prisoners?
Speaker 1: Oh, they was, they was nice, they was nice, treated me nice, and I talked with them, them that could speak Spanish--speak English, see.  I talked with 'em, yeah, they was nice guys.  They was nice, I didn't, I didn't have no trouble with 'em, cause all I had to do is just that truck up there and back it up to that, there in the--them FBI boys put 'em on them trucks, have 'em put--get on them trucks and take 'em on out there and dump 'em off there, take 'em down to the barracks, and drive inside the fence and unload, and then go back out, and I'm through with 'em.
Speaker 2: And this prisoner of war camp was at Fort Hood?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Fort Hood, that's Fort Hood, Tex--not Fort Hood--Camp Hood.
Speaker 2: Camp Hood.
Speaker 1: Camp Hood, at that time, see.  And so they had this big outfit there, and I'd drive in there, and unload them guys off that truck, and then I'd drive back out there and lock the gate up.  And then they got they guards all the way around the place.  Whole big--it was like this whole big block, this whole big area out there, see.  And so they would stay in there.  See, they had their own barracks, own everything, them German prisoners and Jap prisoners.  And see, now, the, see, now, the Jap prisoners over on the north, they cut wood for you to burn for the, for the company, for the whole camp.  And they go out there in them woods and cut them trees down and cut them, cut that cordwood, they call it, and, and stack it up there.  And they had a, I guess they had it high as that tree out there, they had a stack of wood there, I guess, oh, I don't know how--that thing was about fifty or sixty feet high up in the air, had it stacked up there, wood just throwed up on top of one them, great big, big round blocks like this here.  And you go there, and they get ready for some wood, they go out there and get them some wood, take it to barracks around there.  See, that was the Japanese doing--see, they did that in the north camp, see.  But in the south camp, well, see they had gas and everything over there, see, and you burned gas.  You didn't have to--see, them German prisoners, they would like keep the streets clean and around different places, you know, and go down to the--they had a dump ground for the trash and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 18980
Speaker 1: We were talking about the war [World War II], and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, talking about--.
Speaker 1: --talking about the German prisoners.
Speaker 2: German prisoners and the Jap [Japanese] prisoners.
Speaker 1: And I asked you about the black tank unit, and you said that you knew the guys in the black tank--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knowed some of 'em.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, go on and tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Well, see, see, the, see, the, there in Fort Hood, see they had white and black, they worked together.  And they had black tank drivers and they had white tank drivers, there in the camp, see.  See, they all trained, see.  See, I was lucky, I could drive--I was supposed to drive anything but a tank cause I never did fool with 'em.  See, them tanks, see, if you in a tank, you was in a, in a kind of like a cage like, you see, sitting in that tank.  You can't just see everywhere.  You just got a little ole peephole you looking down.  Then you got to know how to use them, to guide, to guide it, to run it, to see, you got left or right, left and right, see.  And now, you didn't have no steering wheel on them tanks, see.  You had a rod.  See, you work by the rod and your foot, see, go left, you go right, you go left, you go right, you go straight ahead, see, like that, see.  And, and you look straight ahead.  See, that's the way them tanks was.  See, that's the reason they didn't allow any and everybody to drive one of them tanks, couldn't drive a tank.  You couldn't drive a tank if you didn't, didn't practice driving.  So they had white and black tank drivers.  They was right there together, and see, they, they bogged down, bogged down one of the tanks, and I had to go and get it out of, out of the mud.  The more the tank do, the, the further it go down (laughter).  So I had to go and pull it out with my truck, a big, big eighteen-wheel, one of them big sixteen-wheeler trucks.  I had to down there and get this thing, and put the (unclear) and draw it out, see, the tank out, out of that mud and stuff.  Got it down in that mud and couldn't get it out.
Speaker 1: Now, how were black soldiers treated at Camp Hood?

And anything go wrong that you go with groceries or go to the warehouse, any, anything like that around in the camp, that was, that's what the, the motor pool was for, quartermaster motor pool.  See, that's to take care of, to supply the, the camp.  Now, this Lieutenant Stateman out of St. Louis, he was out of St. Louis, and he sat down and talked with us at the motor pool.  He said, now, I want to talk with you.  Now, we all--we soldiers, see, the guys we know was talking about a nigger or Uncle Tom or something like that.  And he said, well, wait a minute, wait a minute here.  He said, we soldiers in here, say, we all got, all got the same uniform on.  And we all got about everything, uniforms alike.  Say, now, we soldiers, now, say, we same as brothers.  He said, if you don't call a man by his name, call him soldier, till you learn his name.  Then he had, had everybody's name put on, on a, on they, on the clothes, had that, had they nameplate.  So you would learn whoever he was.  He said, now, you play ball with me, I'll play ball with you.  He said, if you don't, I'll throw you over here in the, in this pen over here--had a fire wire pen right back of us where they put, if you didn't do right.  And he said, now, it's a lot of us in here assigned to this place.  You don't have no regular job.  You just assigned to the motor pool.  We ain't got no place for you to go.  But you assigned to help take care of the guys that is assigned to something.  And say, if one of 'em come to you and ask you to do something for him, say, you do it cause you ain't got nothing to do, meaning you ain't got no special job, but this other guy got a, got a special job.  And if he get, come to you and want you to drive his truck or, or do something for him, you do it cause you ain't nothing to do but just run around here in the motor pool.  He said, now, he said, now, you play ball with me, I'll play ball with you.  And he said, now, it ain't no Uncle Toms in here.  We soldiers.  We got the same uniform on.  We all soldiers, no black, no white or no nothing.  He said, you call a man solider till you learn his name.  And after you learn his name, then you can call him, call him by his name.  If you don't, call him soldier, cause he's a soldier just like you is.  And he say, ain't no colored in here.  He said, they told me I couldn't run a mixed motor pool in Texas.  I say, I can run anything in Texas and anywhere else I want to run it.  You got to go by my rules.  I go by the man's rule, and you go by my rules.  What the man tell me, I'll tell you.

Speaker 1: Even the captain come there, wanted me to grease his car.  And I told him, no, I can't grease your, I can't, and I can't change oil in your car.  He said, why?  I said, you ain't got enough miles on it.  Okay, he goes back to the motor pool, get the big man, brought him down there.  And the man looked at my books, my papers.  He said, nah, you ain't got enough miles.  He said, now, look here, he said, my orders are this, you got to have a thousand miles or more on your car before you can get the oil changed in it, a thousand.  And he said, a thousand miles or more before you--say, you ain't got but two hundred and something on your car.  Now, you want the oil changed.  He said, un-un.  He said, now, I now, I gets my, now, go get the people, now, you go get the big man, see.  Now, now, he--see I wouldn't do it.  So he went and got lieutenant.  And lieutenant came and say, he said, nah, now, if you want to go, go see what the man say.  He said, the man's rules and regulations, a thousand or more miles to get a oil change.  Now, you can get a grease job every day if you want to, but a oil change, you got to have a thousand or more miles on it, a thousand; say, that's the reason you got this, your, your meters on your truck, your whatchamacallit, where he can keep up with it.  When you get a oil change or you get grease job, he can put it down, and then, like that, he can look at your speedometer and see how many miles you got on the truck, how many miles.  So, so you ain't got--he looked at it, he said, you ain't got a, you ain't got a hundred miles on this truck.  He, he had a, it was fire truck, and he wanted an oil change.  He said, nah, this, says, nah, say, you ain't got a hundred miles on this since you got it, got the oil changed.  Now, you can get a grease job, but you can't get a, your oil changed.
Speaker 2: Now, from what I understand, you became a mechanic too, a pretty good--?
Speaker 1: Well, I was a mechanic and grease man and oil man, and license, you had to come through, by me to get your driver's license in, in Fort Hood, Texas, everything.  See, I was over that, I was over that.  If anything I didn't pass, you couldn't, you couldn't--if I didn't okay it, that was it.  You had to go back over, start all over again, motorcycle riders and everything, truck drivers.  And, and if I didn't okay your slip and you got to go back and practice some more and get trained if you don't get--learn how, how to do that.  And see, these here German prisoners, when they call in there, I got this big, ole long truck out there.  I'll go get my truck.  Then I go with the MPs [military police], the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], I go down to the station, the railroad station and pick these soldiers up and these German prisoners or Jap [Japanese] prisoners, take 'em to their barracks and put 'em down there.  If anything come up, like they having some big outfit at the headquarters, I'd had to go to the, to the railroad to pick up a band or something like that.  I had to do that myself.  I, I had to go pick up this band and bring it to the headquarters.  And they played that night, twelve o'clock.  After 12:00 o'clock, I had to load this stuff back on this truck.  I had two white soldiers and two black soldiers on my truck.  They had to load that stuff on this truck, take it back to the, to the railroad, unload it off the, off the, the truck on the train.  I had to pick it up at 12:00 o'clock at night.  I take it back to the train at 1:00 o'clock at night, take it back, unload it, like that.  I, that was my job to take care of that.

Story_ID: 18994
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you this.  Sir, what has all this meant to you being involved in cowboy life and the rodeos and whatever?  What has it meant? Has it been--?
Speaker 2: Well I worked with them.  I worked in the rodeo with them, worked for 'em and all like that.  And be around with them.  And so I was just this regular cowboy I guess.  That's--That was my early days.  See back in--After I left East Texas in 1928.  See up there at West Texas out that '28, '29 [1929], '30 [1930], '31 [1931].  So See I worked with those white folks out there in the rodeos.  And then I came back to East Texas and we started the black rodeo there in Ellaville.  Ellaville in the school there.
Speaker 1: No, no.  Wait.  You told us about that.
Speaker 2: See that's when we started the rodeo there.  See blacks did.  Then I left there.  And I came on back to Denver and me and this guy started this rodeo here.  That's when I got hurt.  See in '48 [1948].  See.  So that stopped my bronc riding for a long time.  I didn't do no--I didn't ride no more broncs and no more horses or nothing.
Speaker 1: Sir, I was asking you how you felt about being involved in--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh I loved it.  I loved it.  I wouldn't have no other record but that.  One of the best records in the world that I ever had.  And everybody liked me in that.  White and black back in that time.  And I went through that with them.  The rodeo.  And I never had no troubles whatever.  No kind of way.  All the time I was out there at West Texas.  And this guy they take me on over to Oklahoma.  We'd ride over there in them rodeos over there in Oklahoma.  That mountain money--make that mountain money.  So I was mostly--I was the only black guy being there a lot of times.  You see, and the man told them.  Done like that.  The deputy sheriff.  You leave him alone.  Sometimes some guy wanna get smart 'cause you black.  You see.  And the man told him.  He said, "Look here.  See you leave him alone." And I never had no more trouble.  Guy wanna kick me.  See.  You know.  And he told him, "Now you leave him alone."  Said, "Now you leave him alone." So I never had no more trouble with the guy.  I'd see him every day or two.  But he never bothered me no more.  Tried to kick me.  And you know, I'd--He kicked me.  And the man told him.  He said, "Now you leave him alone" and nobody--nobody beside--That's the only one.  The rest of them--.
Speaker 1: So you enjoyed being a black cowboy?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I enjoyed it, them white folks.  And the guys I would be riding with, they'd look out--Carry anywhere they wanted--Anywhere they go, I could go.  Anywhere they'd go I could go too.  These people I worked with. Go in any place.  A drug store or a place where they sold something to drink.  I'd go right on in there and sit down right with them and drink.  I remember one place we went in one day and their--I went in there to get some Coke or something.  We went in to get something to drink.  And so the girl brought me a paper bag--paper cup and give him a glass.  He swept the paper cup off the table.  He said, "What is that for?" "That for him to drink." "What about a glass like mine?" So I got up and walked out.  I don't wanna have no trouble.  So I got up and left on out the place.  That was in Vernon, Texas 19--1929.  I said, "I don't want no trouble in there." See.  So I got up and walked on out.  I'd go in any of them places and never was barred out.  Anywhere they'd go I could go.  That's the way it went.  Anywhere they went I could go.  Go in there and sit down and eat and go on my way.  But others couldn't do it.  Now you--.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well just be an old--Just an old black cowboy is all I can say.  Just another--another remembered guy.  That's all I can say.  Just another guy still in the world.  Yeah, a black guy.  Just another human being.  That's all.  Just another human being.  See.  And I went all down through the--I used to go down to San Antonio.  When I was in the army I drove a truck down to San Antonio down--to the depot down there, just old Alonzo.  Old cowboy Alonzo Pettie.
Speaker 1: Now if your parents were alive now what would they think of --?
Speaker 2: Beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: If your mother [Dollie Pettie] and father [Jim Pettie] were around, Sir, what would they--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh I guess they'd be--they'd be proud of me.  All of them proud of me.  You see.
Story_ID: 18995
Speaker 1: And tell you about this--my brother.  My half brother [Christ Johnson].  See my--He had a mule.  Couldn't nobody do nothing with him but him.  He had a place.  Put that mule out there.  When he come to--Just like you come to the fence--the gate.  Just like a dog you had to wait 'til he come and let you in.  When they come there, they had to holler and say, "Where's the old man at?" "He's around here.  Come on in." Now if my brother wasn't there, you better not come on that fence.  Better not get on that fence! But if he was there and he holler and tell you to come on in, come on in.  Better not come in there.
Speaker 2: The mule was like a guard dog?
Speaker 1: He was like a guard.  And so back in the '30s [1930s].  Now he'd had this--Now he had this mule when I wasn't nothing but--That was back--He was getting ready to go in the army in World War I.  So when he got ready, he brought the mule to my father [Jim Pettie].  To my daddy and his mother's house to keep the mule for him, 'til he went in the service and come out.  When he went in, they wouldn't take him 'cause he had some kind of trouble with his heart.  You see.  And so they didn't take him in the army.  And so that night he come back.  He left that night--overnight and then he went home the next day.  Then he come back that night and said, they turned him down.  He couldn't go in the service.  And so my uncles and them they all went on in the service.  So he come on back and got his mule and went on back up there ride over to where he stayed the rest of his life.  Up there.  From there.  I don't know why he liked that country.  And so back in the '30s, something.  I don't know when it was.  But they'd taken this mule from my brother.
Speaker 2: Who did?
Speaker 1: Some white guys.  Said my brother owed him some money.  Went out there and got this mule out of my bro--Where my brother--Quite naturally my brother had to put the rope on him.  My brother put a rope on him, you could lead him anywhere you want to.  But you better not take that rope off him.  Take that rope off him, that's it.  And so they went out there to my brother's place where he was staying and got this mule.  And brought him back to town and put him in the corral and turned him aloose.  When they turned him aloose, they couldn't go back in there no more.  And so some way or another they told him they had Christ's mule down there.  Christ's mule and they can't go in there.  And so--and they got some kind of word--They got out that they were gonna kill the mule.  And some white lady got in--the news of it and she called the sheriff.  'Cause she knowed the mule herself.  See and said, "They're talking about killing Chris's mule." He said, "Where is Chris's mule at?" "He down there in the barn.  The corral down there downtown." And so--Well he went down there, the sheriff, whoever it was.  Said, "I hear you got Chris's mule in here." "Yeah, we got the old mule in here.  And you can't go in there.  We can't go in there." He said, "Well you knowed that when you went and got him." You could lead him anywhere until you take the rope off him, that was it.  Now he had a bunch of mules in the corral, see.  But they couldn't go in there to feed none of them.  Couldn't go in.  And so the man told him, "You talkin' about killing Chris's mule.  Nah, you better not kill that mule.  If you do you're going to the penitentiary yourself." He said, "You go get Chris and let him come and get that mule out of here before he hurt somebody." "Well Chris owe me some--." He told him he didn't give a damn how much money Chris owe you.  "You go get Chris and let him get that mule out of here before he hurt somebody.  And if you kill that mule you're going to the penitentiary too." They went and got my brother.  Got in an old car and went and got him and brought him to town.  Brother got to the gate.  Called him.  Called the old mule by his name.  The mule come there.
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: What was that old mule's name (chuckling).  I can't think of his name now.  What was that old mule's name?  I know the name well.  But I can't think of that old mule now.  But anyhow he called him and the mule come to the--come to the gate.  And he opened the gate and the mule come on out.  He jumped up on his back no bridle, no nothing and went on home.  Kept that mule 'til he died.  What was that mule's name? I can't think of it to save my life.  Nobody could handle that mule but him and my--him and his sister [Bertha Johnson].  Now his sister could catch and go around with him and my daddy [Jim Pettie].  But nobody else could do nothing with him.
Speaker 2: Now that's a funny story.
Speaker 1: That was a funny mule.  But they made it--and the man told him, he didn't care how much money my brother owed, "You go get Chris and get that mule out of here."  And he kept that mule 'til he died.  Money or no money.  'Cause that mule would kill someone.  And so then he had another horse--a horse like that.  Now I don't--some way he messed up or something where he lost his little old five acres of land he had.  And so see like this here block.  See.  He stayed over here--.
Speaker 2: Don't duck out of the picture now.  You're ducking out of the picture with your head down.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Say like this here block here and this block over here.  Now he lost this block over here.  Now he skipped this block here and moved over to this block.  Now the man let him build him a house there.  Build a house on this--.
Speaker 2: His land was split up then.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So the man let him build him a house.  So he tore some of his houses down over there on his other farm and brought them over and built him a little house there.  And see you come up here to this man's house like that and come on down to his house.  Now the road you turn here and go back here to there and then turn back-go back to town.  And so that was in '32 [1932], when we built this house for my brother, '32.  Built that house there for him.  Now he had a horse.  Now this fellow that wanted his place.  He let this white fellow keep his horse up there on his--Let my brother keep his--the horse up there on his farm.  He had a big cow pasture like, you know.  Around there.  And so my brother--And this man feed him apples and oranges and--not oranges.  But banana--yeah, apples and what else? What were those things he fed him?
Speaker 2: Carrots?
Speaker 1: I can't think of them other old kind of fruit he said.  Fed his--He wasn't nothing but a colt.  And my brother kept him 'til my brother lost--my brother lost his leg here.  See something was wrong.  He got that--What he had when he was a kid.  See something like that.  Some kind of heart trouble or something.  And had lost his leg.  And had this horse.  And couldn't nobody do nothing with that horse when my brother died.  He said--This guy would feed him pails of apples and peaches.  This white fellow would feed that little colt coming up.  And my brother had that horse, trained him and everything.  You couldn't even come in his house.  And he around here in the pasture.  You couldn't come inside there.  That mule--the mule was dead.  But the horse--and so yeah.  Couldn't nobody--.
Story_ID: 18996
Speaker 1: Do you have any advice for people that wanna be a cowboy now or would like to be a cowboy?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well if they want to--.
Speaker 1: Do you think there's still room for black cowboys now?
Speaker 2: Well it ain't like it used to be.  'Cause they don't--the blacks don't have many farms and things up in this part of the country like they used to down in the South.  See down in the South sure.  I would like for 'em down in--way back down in Mississippi and all them places back down there.  I'd like for them to have a black rodeo.  They have them in Texas.  But see down in Louisiana and all--Remember--Made me think about we had a rodeo in Louisiana once.  The man taken our stock.  Now we goes down there and rents the place to have a rodeo for a week, black rodeo in Shreveport, Louisiana.  Now we done so good, when we got ready to leave, the man wouldn't let us take our stock.  He wanted more money.  Now we got to come back to Longview--Longview Texas, that was in Shreveport.  We had to come back to Longview up the road and get the man.  Tell the man.  See the man had--you know, had the contract.  You know, where we paid the man his money and know what he charged us to have this place and everything.  He got his money.  But he wanted more money.  'Cause we made more money.  See.  'Cause they didn't think we were gonna have that kind of thing down in Shreveport.  A big rodeo.  You see.  And so--So anyhow, the man went down and told him, "He better turn that stock aloose.  You know, he going to the penitentiary hisself." That's how we got our stock from down there in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: So you got it back?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So anybody going into this business now gotta be careful.  Right?
Speaker 1: Got to be careful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See like you go lease a place, go to some other town.  Like you go down to Colorado Springs or Pueblo or down here in Rocky Mountain back up out here and get you a place.  And you--The man tell you how much he wanted for it.  And you give him his money.  Now that's all the money he can get.  He can't get no more.  Now if you wanna donate him some--a little--Give him a little handout it's all right.  But he can't hold your stuff when you get ready to move.  'Cause you then paid him his money.  See.  And that's what that guy wanted to do down in Louisiana.  He wanted more money and wouldn't let us have the stock out there.  But I had to come back to Texas to get the big man.  And the big man go down there, no more--no trouble.  When the big man went down there and said, "Let these horses go." And showed him his papers.  Showed him how--what he had signed.  The guy then paid him his money.  So now you can't get no more.  If the man wanna donate you something, that's all right.  That's up to him.  But if he don't you not getting nothing.  'Cause he done already paid you."
Story_ID: 18997
Speaker 1: What is the last thing you wanna say as a--(laughing) 'til we get to the pictures?  You know.
Speaker 2: Well I just--It's a good thing for black people to have a history.  It's good for blacks to have some kind of history of--that they did good in life.  They did something good in life.  See.  That people know and recognize them as somebody.  See.  Besides a nigger.  See they call you a nigger.  A nigger or jackrabbit whatever they wanna call you.  'Cause you're a human being just like the rest of the people.  The Good Book says--It's no color in the Bible.  The Bible don't speak of no kind of color in the Bible.  There's no color nowhere in the Bible.  I ain't such a good reader and all that can remember stuff.  But what I see, I know.  Bible don't say nothing about no color in the Bible.  Human being.  Human being! That mean anybody can be a human being.  Don't make no difference what color you is.  You human.  You people just like the rest of them.  You like the same thing I like.  And I like the same thing you like.  Just your color--Now okay.  You know why you're white--Know where you was born--where you was raised from? Where you come from your--the history of the world, where you started from? Up in Alaska.  Where it's not hot.  Where did black man start? Over in the hottest place in the world.  When that sun come out, boy you--you turn your color.  A lot of mine and your'n too.  You get over there and stay over there a while.  But you was born in--See.  Just like the people down in Mexico.  Hot weather.  A lot of--a lot different from the white man.  Just like, but you started from the beginning, you started from up here in Alaska.  Way back up in Alaska the white and then they come down.  See.  And then the blacks started from over there.  And they mixed them up together.  When the man passed the law that peoples is people and things like--Now see I was right here in Denver here.  In fact way back in when I first come.  Now see you could live with a white woman here, but you couldn't marry her here.  Now you could go out of the state and marry her somewhere and then come back here and live.  But they wouldn't sell you no license to marry a white woman here in this state.  Now okay.  Dealing around with peoples.  Peoples with peoples.  The mayor of the town and his partnership friends, blacks people with him.  See.  Working with him.  Now okay.  I go out here and marry--go over here to Oklahoma some where and marry a white woman or down in Mexico and come back here and live with her.  Now why can't I sell a lic--buy some license here? They gonna live here.  Well Mr.  Mayor say, "Well hell." They got to go out of the state to get a license to get married and then come back here and live, and you don't--No.  Started selling them a license.  Let 'em buy a license here.  If they wanna marry a black, let 'em marry here.  Sell them a license.  So that when he started selling.  Said, "You live here, but you can't marry here." Now what different is it? You got to go out of the state get married to somebody, then come back here and live.  Now you can't live together here--and--Well you can live here with somebody.  But you don't have no license.  You can't buy a license here.  Get a license.  Said, "What different do it make?" The license is just between 'em.  Sell 'em a license here.  You got the money right back in the state.  You take your money out of the state and go buy a license somewhere else.  When you can make it right here in the state yourself.  One way or another, forward or backward.  Mostly it's going forward all the time.  A little bit--a little bit at a time.
Story_ID: 18998
Speaker 1: Like the schools started--Like now when President Whatchamacallit.  Taking prayer and discipline out of school.  You know what I said, "He done take the bits out of kids' mouths." When the president of whatchamacallit, when he was in the capitol, whatchamacallit--you know what I'm talking about.  Before--After [Lyndon B.] Johnson.  Not Johnson.  Yeah it was Johnson.  And he taken the discipline out of school.  Taking prayer out of schools.  Now you know the Bible says, "You put bits in a horse's mouth to train him to make you go like you want him to do.  Then when you get him trained, you take the bits out." See just like I tell you about this mule with my brother [Christ Johnson].  He trained him to do anything he wanted him to do.  He lead that--He could take that mule up here and drop the reins here.  That mule will stay right there 'til he come back.  He pull the bridle off him, he going out there and eat him some grass and stuff.  Then when he go out there and whistle for him, he come back and here and he put the saddle on him, get on him and go on home.  That's how that mule was.  You put bits in a horse's mouth to train him to go like you want.  You wanna go left or you wanna go right.  You wanna go straight.  You see.  Like that.  So that's the same way you have to do people.  You take the kids--the bits out of kids' mouth up at the school, and don't discipline them, they'll do what they damn please.  They'll do what they wanna do.  And make you sick from it.  If you take this and prayer.  Prayer is supposed to--you supposed to teach kids how to say the Lord's Prayer.  Teach them how to say the Lord's Prayer.  Teach him.  Teach him discipline.  Obey your rules.  Don't do as you wanna do.  Obey the man's rules.  If the man send me somewhere, "You go up there and get me a bottle of Coca-Cola." I come back here with a Doctor Pepper or something.  Now you mad, "Now go back and get me a Coca-Cola." Wouldn't you? That's what you say.  Now if I go back and get a Coke again, you're gonna-You're gonna spank me.  "Now you go back and get me a Coke like I said."  Or something.  Now see that's the way you gotta do a kid.  You tell them what to do.  I'll tell you something that happened to me when I was a kid.  A little old fellow.  I guess I wasn't--Oh I wasn't big enough to go to school at that time.  I was up there in Tyler Texas.  We went in a store.  My mother [Dollie Pettie] and I was in this store.  And by me being in the store--in the store there, the man had a table.  A round table like that.  A round table.  And he had some hats up there.  And had them old long hair pins like that.  You ever seen some of them old long hat pins they called them? Now a bunch of them had fell on the floor.  And I'm down there picking them up putting them in the hats.  See.  Sticking them in there.  'Cause they done fell on the floor.  My mama seen me.  She spanked me right there in the store.  Said, "Did he tell you to pick them up?" I said, "No." She said, "Well leave them down there then." The man told her, he said, "Girl, that's all right.  Let him--let him go ahead and pick them up." She said, "No.  You didn't tell him in the first place.  Let him keep his hands off of that." And so she whipped me.  Taking me out there and put me in the wagon.  And I stayed out there in the wagon by myself.  And she went on back there in the store.  Now I was a little kid.  You know.  Now she said--when she come back--She said, "Now when I tell you to--not to do something, you don't do it.  You don't pick up nothing off the floor or off anywhere, lest somebody tell you to pick it up." And she taught me that.  She said, "Don't you touch that lessen he tell you to."  You go in the store, your kid go in there and steal something. I seen kids right, go and steal stuff out--run out the store.  Go in there with--Go and steal some candy and out the door they go.  My mother beat me to death.  "Don't touch nothing in that store.  You go in that store and leave everything alone, lest they tell you to touch it." That's--You start a kid off at the beginning learning not to bother nothing.  You come in here--I come in here.  Sat me down in that chair.  I sat there and listened at y'all.  I never moved.  Lest they tell me.  Maybe I may wanna go to the restroom or something or the bathroom go take a leak or something.  Like that.  But I sat right there in the chair.  But I wouldn't move lest she tell me to move.  My mother.  I wasn't but a kid.  And when I got ready--Maybe I'd--She come over and I say, "I wanna go to the bathroom I wanna go take a leak." You see.  Something like that.
