Kiefer: Today is May 15, 2014. On behalf of the Stanford Historical Society, I,
Joyce Kiefer, am going to interview Leonore Herzenberg. We’re going to
talk about her career and her life.
Lee, the first thing I want to ask you is when and where were you
born and where were you raised.
Herzenberg: [00:00:25] I was the next-to-the-last baby born in Harlem Hospital on
February 15, 1935. My parents at the time lived across the river in the Bronx
in what was a working-class neighborhood, nice neighborhood but workingclass. They lived there about four months. When I was four months old my
mother decided that she’d had enough of that place and enough of my
grandmother, my father’s mother,, and she moved out to Brighton Beach
along with her mother and her sisters. She took an apartment in a very nice
building right near the beach. At that time Brighton Beach was, again, a
working-class neighborhood, very, very intellectual, lots of discussion and
talks all the time, and she loved that.
Kiefer: Did you have brothers and sisters?
Herzenberg: [00:01:31] I had one brother seven years older.

10

Kiefer: You mentioned that there was a lot of intellectual conversation in the
neighborhood. What would you say was the general feeling about women?
Did people at that time in your community have the feeling that women had
a certain place or were things more open?
Herzenberg: [00:01:55] That’s a good question, actually. Brighton Beach was a much
more liberated atmosphere. It was one of the reasons, I think, my
grandmother decided to move there. I think she wanted to be nearer the
ocean, and it was a new neighborhood at that time. These were new
apartment buildings and she liked to live in them. She lived probably about
six blocks away from my mother. It was all very comfortable.
In terms of women, my mother had three sisters, all of them were
very bright. The attitude in the family was that women worked, but that was
actually a very Jewish attitude, which people don’t really appreciate these
days. If you go into the history of it, in the shtetl, the women were often the
ones who were the breadwinners. If you were able to you ran a stall, you
sold things, you did things so that your husband could go and study, and
that was the ultimate goal. Most families didn’t achieve that. Both husband
and wife needed to do as much as they could in order to survive. Women
were expected to read and write, but they read Yiddish, not Hebrew. They
were not allowed to read Hebrew, and they were not meant to be educated,
but they were certainly meant to be commercial.
One of my aunts ultimately ran a very large store, a television store.
They were the first to introduce television into—I guess it was Queens at

11

the time. So if you go back to the attitude in the neighborhood, I grew up in
that kind of environment.
The other aunt was married to a schoolteacher and, in principle,
stayed home. She was more or less a kind of costume designer. She went
back to work as soon as her youngest was about eight years old or so. She
sold women’s undergarments at Best & Co. on Fifth Avenue, which was
really a hotshot place to get to work at.
So all three sisters were very bright and very, very different. My
mother was closest to the aunt who ran the store, and I grew up in her
store. I guess one out of every two weekends, at least, we would go out and
help Aunt Ruth at the store because that was what was needed. I was closest
to those cousins. My father was closest to the uncle.
This is a very interesting—“intellectual” is not really the right word--but my father and uncle were very much into engineering. The uncle was
one of the first television engineers, and in 1939 he had the television booth
at the World’s Fair. So we would go to visit Uncle George at the World’s
Fair and see the television. You could see yourself on television. It was
amazing. It was a little postage-stamp screen, but you stood in front of the
camera and you could see yourself, and that’s what the booth was about.
George was doing this when the war broke out. My father was
completely knowledgeable about what he was doing because they would sit
and talk about it for hours. My father was an electrician but didn’t do house
electrical work. He did heavy factory installations and specialized in moving
a factory and being able to set up the machinery so a minimum amount of

12

time would be lost. In that sense he was an efficiency engineer. So he’s a
funny guy, but the two of them together were always together and always
talking about that kind of stuff.
My cousins weren’t that interested, but I was. I used to sit and listen
to them. I didn’t know much about what they were doing, but I certainly did
love to hear them.
Kiefer: I think you said you had helped your father wire a house that he built?
Herzenberg: [00:06:13] Well, he rebuilt our house. World War II hit at that time and
everything changed. My father tried to volunteer. He was very, very
patriotic. He really believed strongly in the United States. He believed in a
United States in which working people and black people and everybody had
a vote. He believed in the principle of democracy that Roosevelt was
establishing at the time. And Mayor LaGuardia. My father had worked for
Fiorello LaGuardia’s campaign [for mayor of New York City] before I was
born and really just believed strongly that people who have a vote should be
able to vote. The whole American gestalt about what a citizen should do he
believed and really wanted to do and felt everybody should do. He was very
strongly behind the war effort.
He and his brothers had some of the first cars that people could buy,
and they tinkered with the cars. He knew about electricity and was one of
the first master electricians in New York City. I think he had license number
twenty. He conducted his business out of our house, so, again, I got to listen
to all the things that went on with the business, his customers calling, what

13

he was going to do for the customers, talking to the inspectors. I just grew
up in the middle of that.
My mother ran his business for him. She did all the bookkeeping and
took telephone calls and did whatever needed to be done. That was also
done from our house, so I was in the middle of that. I was in the middle of
civic-minded people. He was extremely civic-minded, and he believed
everybody should be.
So going back, when the war broke out my father was just starting a
business in fluorescent lighting. He understood that fluorescent lighting was
the direction to go in the city for all sorts of industrial installations, and so
he started something called the A-Light Company (A for Adlerstein, my
maiden name). He got himself a small shop downtown, built fluorescent
fixtures and was starting to install them when the war broke out. Now, had
he been like most people he would have seen that his business was a
business to make fortunes on.
My father probably saw that, but he was not interested in fortunes.
He was interested in doing his civic duty. So he simply shut the business
down and tried to get into the army. Well, of course, he was too old and he
had two children, so they didn’t take him. Then he said, “Well, I’ll volunteer
and I’ll do electrical work for the army.”
He wound up doing electrical work for the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
Everyone who volunteered to work there was asked, “What do you want?”
He checked “electrical,” so they gave him a test, wiring a particular circuit.
They gave them the wires and had a little circuit on the board. He took one

14

look at it, and bang, bang, bang, he’s done and hands it in. They said, “Wait,
wait, wait. You couldn’t have done that.”
He said, “It’s OK.”
The guy says, “Well, this is wrong. It’s not the way it says.”
“Well,” my father says, “It works. Try it.” [laughter]
He said, “Yes.”
“Well, this is a faster way to wire that same circuit.”
“Fine. You can be an electrician for the navy!”
What being an electrician was then was going into the hulls of ships
and wiring circuits. The circuits were fixed and extremely simple because the
other guys on the crews were barbers and similar things. One guy was a fruit
store vendor. These were people who just knew enough about wires to be
willing to tie them onto posts.
This was just driving my father crazy. The foreman knew much less
than he knew. The ship wasn’t being wired correctly according to the way he
would do it, and this really annoyed him. He said, “Here I am, I’m trying to
volunteer for the war effort, and they put me doing something which is
really useless. The barber next door can do this. I can train this whole crew
to do it correctly in no time at all.”
He tried to complain, it didn’t do any good. Finally my father noticed
that the electrician crew kept breaking electrical bulbs that they used to light
their work on the ships. These lights were called “trouble lamps” at the
time. They’re just an extension cord with a bulb at the end with a little wire
cage around the bulb so if you hit it, in principle, it wouldn’t break. But the

15

crew kept breaking the light bulbs anyway. This bothered my father no end.
I mean, I’m seven years old at the time so I’m in the middle of all this
discussion, and I’m listening. I remember this as well as if it were today. He
was so annoyed with this, and he was telling my uncle about this and saying,
“This just can’t be. We can’t do this.”
So finally he figured it out. He told the guys on the crew he could do
his work and he had plenty of free time left over. He said, “You just come
and tell me whenever you want a trouble lamp moved. Don’t move it. I’ll
bring it over for you.” And he would put it up on the pipe and give it a hitch
so that it couldn’t be knocked over and it couldn’t be broken.
Well, about a month or two after he started doing this he got called
in from somebody who was higher up the line. He went into the office
building and he stood in front of the desk, and he thought they were going
to commend him for saving light bulbs. And they said, “Are you the guy
that’s been fixing the light bulbs?”
He said, “Yes, I am,” and he started explaining why he’s doing it.
He says, “Well, the problem is that we’re piling up light bulbs in the
warehouse because your crew isn’t breaking them fast enough. You stop
doing that.”
That was enough for him. He said he’s getting off this ship. He said,
“I’m not going to go and cost the government money. Let somebody else
do that.”
So he studied out the Navy Yard buildings. There were two of them.
I’m telling you this long story because it really was the kind of thing that

16

conditioned me to not take no for an answer. He figured out that if he went
up to the fifth floor there was a crossover into the high-level administrative
building, and you could go up there. You’d walk up the stairway, you’d get
up there, you’d get across this thing, then there was a stairway that he found
to walk up, and he turned up in the Admiralty Office and said, “I want out.”
And they said, “What do you want to do?”
He said, “I can teach electricity. I can teach all these guys all this.”
Ultimately, he spent the rest of the war teaching electricity to flight pilots.
Now, had he been, again, somebody who was interested in anything other
than doing something creative he would have just hung with that school.
After the pilot school closed down it became a big trade school. Nope, he
went back to his business. By this time other companies had gotten in with
their war contracts, so he never was able to make a business out of the
fluorescent lighting, but he went back and continued to do contracting.
As I got older I would complain about school, and he and my mother
had to figure out what to do about me. They offered to put me into a school
for gifted children, but we lived in Brighton Beach, and this was in Avenue
D in downtown Brooklyn. To get there I would have had an hour a day on
the trolley to get there and another hour to come back. My mother, of
course, would have had to go with me and pick me up every single day that
way. None of that made any sense. It wasn’t clear that going to a gifted
school was really what I should be doing anyway.
So in the end they kept me in the school that was across the street
from my house. I would cry, “I don’t want to go to school. I’m bored. The

17

teachers they don’t like me. The kids punch me.” All sorts of things would
happen because I always knew the answers. They could have skipped me,
but they didn’t want to skip me. I don’t know most of that. It was done out
of my hearing.
But the net result was that by the time I reached ten or eleven my
parents decided they could teach me a lot by homeschooling, but not to
keep me out of school, which they would never do. They believed I should
be in school. But one day out of every two weeks or two days out of every
two weeks, I was allowed to stay home. I didn’t stay at home, but I went to
work with my father. At that time he was driving around the city. He had a
couple of teams working, and he would bring whatever supplies they
needed– pipes, plugs, whatever---and then he would give them instruction.
And then he’d go and collect money from the customers and go to check
out some new jobs.
This meant driving all over New York City. During that time we
played learning geography by finding every license plate possible. We found
all the states. At that time it was forty-eight, and I had to remember and be
able to call them off as to what they were.
He loved math problems, and that started before we moved into the
house that we rebuilt. It would have been 1941 so I was maybe six years old
or so. He would just do math problems with me every morning, so we’d just
sit. He might ask, “If a bathtub could hold ten gallons of water, and the tap
came in at two gallons a minute, how long would it take to fill at two gallons
a minute?” How many minutes to fill the bathtub? He would just invent all

18

kinds of problems like that. My mother wasn’t too keen on this. [laughs] She
said, “What does a little girl need to do with that much arithmetic?” But on
the other hand she was a bookkeeper, and she was bright in arithmetic
herself, and she saw it as arithmetic.
My father actually had no schooling in math, but he ultimately wound
up deriving the calculus to the extent that he encountered various problems.
He just figured out and understood limit theory. I mean, I only realized this
when I was in high school and I learned it formally. But that’s what he had
done, so he had that kind of mind. It was always with me, doing stuff like
that.
My mother wouldn’t let my father teach me to speak and understand
Hebrew. He bought the books. He was going to teach me. But my mother
said “no”. Jewish boys were all taught to read Hebrew phonetically and to
minimally understand the language for their Bar Mitzvah. But my mother
wasn’t for me understanding and speaking Hebrew. My father had already
taught me to read Hebrew phonetically. In fact I could successfully read
phonetically from the time I was about two and a half, I think. My father
used to like to show my reading off to an elderly rabbi who used to sit on
the boardwalk in Brighton Beach, which was near Coney Island. As close as
I can figure that Rabbi died around my third birthday.
Kiefer: This is interesting.
Herzenberg: [00:18:21] In a sense this turned me into somebody who felt I was expected
to perform intellectually. My parents realized I was pretty bright, and my

19

father in particular, but my mother as well catered to that brightness. They
wanted me to learn all kinds of stuff.
The old rabbi I mentioned used to sit wrapped up on the boardwalk
in Brighton Beach winter and summer. My father was the kind of person
who really cared about people and would talk with all kinds of people,
young and old, at least that was the way my parents were. Respect and the
need to care for the elderly was built into our culture. My parents had met
while entertaining at old people’s homes, where my father would translate
songs from English to Yiddish. “South of the Border.” It’s hilarious in
Yiddish. So he would translate all these songs, and he, my mother and some
other young people would perform them in Yiddish at the old people’s
home.
So after moving to Brighton Beach right after I was born my father
found this older man, the rabbi I mentioned, who was sitting alone on the
boardwalk. Typical for my father he thought this was a good person for him
to take care of, so he stopped, sat down and talked to him. Ultimately, he
started bringing me with him to talk to the rabbi and read from what’s called
the Siddur, the Hebrew prayer book. I would read it. I know I was between
the age of two and three because we moved away from there by then and
we heard the rabbi died. I was able to phonetically read the morning prayers,
and this old rabbi had me come and read this to him every day. He loved
having me do this. It was very reinforcing for me.
I’m bouncing back and forth between the times I was two to seven
years old when a lot of this formation was laid. Basically it was my job in the

20

family to acquire as much learning as I could, anything that was learning was
good. I was rewarded a huge amount for this.
My mother was a little worried about this way of bringing me up. I
would have to find a husband. She grew up in a traditional situation, and
that was what girls were supposed to do. But, again, by the time I was nine
my mother’s closest sister, Ruthie, was running a big business. She’d always
been in business with her husband, who was my father’s closest friend.
Ruthie had always run the store and the business, and my mother thought
that was great.
The stories they told always celebrated the lack of traditional
femininity that Ruthie’s role implied. She was a very good-looking woman,
and she liked to dress well. But the only car she had to drive for a certain
period of time while she and George were trying to gather together as much
money as they could to buy a business, was a small panel truck. One day we
were all going to go visit someone, and she was driving the truck with me
and my cousins in the back and my mother in the seat on the side. Ruthie
was all dressed up in a Persian lamb fur coat with a hat and big muff—she
looked beautiful—and high heels. Some guy got mad at something she did
in the truck. It was a driving thing. And the guy got out of his car all ready
to fight with this truck driver, and she got out of the truck and, and he said,
“It’s OK, lady. It’s OK, lady. Don’t worry about it.” [laughs] It was that
kind of stuff.
Family stories were all full of that. Ruthie was very capable of dealing
with whatever she had to. Her husband was a very interesting guy who, as I

21

said, was my father’s best friend. He was an Arab, born in Beirut. We were
probably the only Jewish family in New York at that time that had an Arab
in it. By the time I knew him George was culturally as Jewish as the rest of
us, but he always pointed out that he was Arab and a Christian Arab at that.
So we all celebrated Christmas with George. It was his, George’s, holiday to
say what we did and how we celebrated. Not religious. We just went to his
and Ruthie’s house for dinner. George loved to cook, so on Thanksgiving
and Christmas he would cook elegant dinners. He’d make a beautiful turkey.
But for all of that George was very much a part of a Jewish family and had
no religious or cultural connection outside it. His mother had kept much
more of her Syrian ways and would cook us great Syrian food whenever
Ruthie and George took us to visit her. But while she was different George
was not. Growing up this way was for me a multicultural experience even
though none of us knew it by that name.
Kiefer: So would you say that within the family and also within, say, the
neighborhood, women were pretty well respected and listened to?
Herzenberg: [00:23:20] Well, within the family, definitely. [laughs] My father used to say,
“When Reggie (my grandmother) says, ‘I want to talk to you’ she doesn’t
want to talk to you, she wants to hit you with the fry pan,” So women
definitely had a very strong voice in the family.
Outside, the neighborhood was such that I think it did accord
women a voice, but for all of that, women knew their place. My mother was
worried about what would become of me. The neighborhood was worried. I
had a friend who was probably an intersex girl. I befriended her because

22

there was something odd about her and because she was very bright and fun
to play with because she would do anything.
There were a bunch of girls in the classroom who were what we
called “girlie girls,” and they had no use for us. They made it very clear that
we were freaks, all of us, not just the one girl, but those of us who were
getting As on our report cards and would speak up and say the right answers
in class. There were four or five girls in our group, maybe 10-12 in the girlie.
My closest friend was a rabbi’s daughter, Annie. We all went from first
grade to sixth grade together. There were very few new people in the
neighborhood.
The entire school was Jewish. There were two kids who went to
school on the Jewish holiday, only two out of the entire school. The people
in the neighborhood were mostly garment-industry workers, small business
owners, that kind of stuff. It was a very contained neighborhood between
Coney Island and Manhattan Beach. Manhattan Beach, only a few blocks
away, had bigger houses. People there owned their own businesses and “had
money.” By Silicon Valley standards right now the people in Manhattan
Beach really didn’t have money. [laughs] But they were able to buy what
clothes they wanted. My family couldn’t.
I made all my clothes, actually remade. I could sew everything. Aunt
Ruth’s clothes, which were great, never went to waste. When she decided
she didn’t want something anymore I got it and cut it down and made it into
whatever I wanted. My mother was very good at sewing. My other aunt,
Tillie, was very good also. Ruthie never sewed. Maybe she sewed a button

23

on or fixed a small tear. I’m sure it wasn’t anything more than that. She
might have known how to sew, but she didn’t have time to do that and run
the business.
So as I grew up, it was a mixture of women knowing their place but
also not. It was different in many ways. The women didn’t have to entertain
for their husbands. They had their place at home, but to the extent that they
could manage to make some money, that was good. People did whatever
they could along those lines. Mostly the women didn’t go to work. They
stayed home with the kids. This was right after World War II when there
was a tremendous pressure to stay home with your kids because the
government wanted to open up the jobs for the men who were coming back
from the army. So there was a very conscious pressure to stay home. No
latchkey kids!
Kiefer: When you were in high school, say, towards the end of high school, did you
have an idea of what you wanted to study, if you wanted to go to college, or
what would be your place in the world next?
Herzenberg: [00:27:10] That’s a good question. I’m going to back you up on that a little
bit. I will come back to that.
My father ran a Boy Scout troop, and, again, as part of his civic duty,
he needed to do this. My brother was in the troop for a while and then
became an Explorer Scout, and so my father then ran the Explorer post. My
brother was wild. He was very wild. Cut school, et cetera. However, he
ultimately got a PhD at Princeton and became the head of computing and
psychology at Old Westbury College in New York, which is one of the

24

SUNY colleges when they first started the SUNY thing. He was a very
interesting character. My mother would rant at my father, “Teach him a
trade because otherwise he’s going to be a juvenile delinquent.” So my
father taught him electricity.
By the time my brother was eighteen he was out of the house. He
joined the army. This was just pre-Korean War. My parents didn’t like it, but
they thought, “Well, maybe at least it’ll keep him out of trouble.” [laughs]
He was also very, very bright, could get an A, 100 out of 100, on his physics
regent and fail English. And everybody asked, “How could you fail
English?” Well, he didn’t turn in his papers. [laughs]
With my father running the Boy Scout troop in the summers, I was
allowed to go to the Scout meetings with him. I tried out the Girls Scouts,
and I came home and they asked me, “Well, what did you learn?”
I said, “Oh, it’s going to be great. We’re going to learn how to bake
cookies, and we’re going to learn how to sew buttons.”
My mother said, “You already know how to sew buttons. I can teach
you how to bake cookies. What are you going to learn there?” [laughs]
I was excited by whatever they told me. But my father said, “Right.
You go to the Boy Scout meetings with me.” So I never went to Girl Scouts,
I went to Boy Scouts, which was good. My father would run a class,
basically. Every Scout meeting was a class. In the summertime he’d run that
class on the beach on a Sunday morning.
The one thing that I was not allowed to do was not to answer a
question if I knew the answer. Since he knew what I knew would be the

25

answer, I didn’t have a choice in this. I couldn’t just blink my eyes. So I
learned in a crowd of eight boys plus me, sitting around in a circle on the
beach. He would ask questions about geography, about science, about
whatever he thought to ask a question about. The boys were older than me,
but if I knew the answer I was to speak up. He probably put questions in
that he knew I could answer and was testing me. That’s what taught me to
speak up in a roomful of men, and that was probably the single most
important thing that I had going for me when I got older, when I started
heading towards doing real intellectual stuff.
I would be asked again and again by women, “Don’t you feel
uncomfortable? You were the only woman in there.”
“Yes, I guess I was.” I related to the men as persons, and I knew
them all, and it didn’t matter to me that I was the only woman in that room,
and it didn’t matter to them either. They were used to me, and that was it.
So now heading back to high school, of my teachers in high school,
two of the three I remember very well were women. Sophie Wolf in biology
and Ruth Goldstein in English and film.
The high school was fantastic. If you take a list of the people who
came from there, it ranges from Arthur Kornberg here, Paul Berg, Arthur
Miller. The number of people who did very well at different things was
really outstanding.
Kiefer: What high school was this?
Herzenberg: [00:31:59] It’s Lincoln High School.
Kiefer: In New York City?

26

Herzenberg: [00:32:01] Yes. It served Brighton Beach, Coney Island, and a portion of—I
don’t even know what you call that neighborhood. A highway divided the
Brighton Beach side of it from the other side, the Avenue Z neighborhoods.
We also had Woody Guthrie in the neighborhood. Brighton was a mixture.
It was a constant fairly friendly argument between people in the Communist
Party versus the majority, which was made up of various shades of left of
where my father was, which was Democratic. He had worked in electoral
politics. There were people who argued electoral politics is no good. Others
said electoral politics is good. There were some card-carrying Communists
prior to World War II, but after the war there were a very few that I knew
about.
The whole neighborhood, however, was a fellow traveler in one way
or another. Workmen’s Circle [Jewish fraternal organization committed to
social justice] was an important organization. My parents, politically, spent
their time getting a library put into our neighborhood. It took them about
five years of begging City Hall, but we finally got it. My mother and all the
kids had to walk either to Sheepshead Bay or to Coney Island to libraries.
That was a dangerous walk because there were the kids from the Catholic
church who used to beat up the Jewish kids. [laughs] These were complex
neighborhoods you’d go through, and you’d get stoned. So my mother
fought to get the library put in. She lived in the library. We couldn’t buy
books, not all the books she wanted to read. In a poor neighborhood
whoever heard of buying books? So it was fantastic to have the library
nearby.

27

There was also a gay guy who moved in. We lived on a lane, and he
and his mother moved close by. They were South African Jews who had
relocated to New York. She was in her seventies and he was in his forties, I
guess, and took a strong liking to me. They both did. I became an extra
daughter for the mother. My mother was very close to her. She held and
comforted her while she died. You couldn’t get an ambulance in those
times. These days our neighbor would have lived. She had a minor heart
attack.
Mary Finn had a library. She and David were readers, they were
educated, and she had a library in the house. She would let me read from
that library. It was an all-fiction library. But I remember that bookcase. I can
still see it. I was allowed the books but not the ones on the bottom shelf.
She would eventually say, “OK, now you can read these.” She would pick
out stuff and guide me through. So I read—oh, you would know all the
names if I could think of them right now---but they included the short story
“Rain” by Somerset Maugham about Sadie Thompson. That was the kind of
thing on those shelves.
David, who was a hairdresser in one of the big department stores,
was always there. He looked at me…this was when I was just going into
high school,and somebody had given me a horrible permanent wave, and
my hair was such a mess. He looked at it, and he said, “No, no, no, this has
got to go.” [laughs] So he cut my hair.

28

Then he took me to my first concerts, and he took me to his friend’s
apartment in Greenwich Village, and I would hear music and see things.
The neighbors would be on Mom. “You let him take her?”
“He’s not going to do anything to her. He loves her.” [laughs]
So I grew up with this freedom with people in my life that very few
in our neighborhood ever saw or heard, the Scouting, my father’s friends in
the Scouting who were craftspeople and very bright people who were trying
to lead Scouting in a direction that it refused to go, but he tried hard.
There were just all sorts of things like that, and they didn’t make me
be a girl like the girlie girls. They had no real desire for me to be that, nor
did they see that I would have ever been able to be that.
I had an uncle, a much younger uncle, very close to my brother. My
brother took me to see Pete Seeger when he played to a room of ten people.
He hung around with that crowd. My uncle was friends with Seeger himself
and the Peekskill crowd. So my uncle was very left. I don’t think he was ever
a card-carrying member of the party, but he and my father would talk
politics all the time about it. He was very much involved in the artistic and
intellectual community, and his best friend was Paul Robeson. Robeson
loved my grandmother and was always asking my grandmother to cook for
him.
Kiefer: When you were in high school did you decide that you wanted to go to
college, or was that expected in some way?
Herzenberg: [00:38:19] Well, of all my friends in high school there were few girls. One
girl was Communist Party. Her family was card-carrying Communists. They

29

were very intent on party stuff. But she was my closest friend. My brother
said, “No, I know about that stuff. You’re not going to join the Young
Progressives, the “youth arm” of the CP in those days. They’re no good for
you.” OK.
Of the two friends I had, one of them went to Young Progressives
and went to college. The other one got married to a butcher. That was what
her parents had in mind for her, and she was happy with that. Those were
the only two friends. The rest of the people that we hung out with were the
boys.
Creative Writing Club, I was very active in that. I published a story in
the Creative Writing Club. I was very active in the film class. Ruth Goldstein
was very active. She had a film class that was phenomenal. It was what you
would get in the best film class in colleges today. They were making Cyrano
de Bergerac, and she had an “in” with the filming of it. She brought the actors
from Cyrano, José Ferrer and these people, to our class. Our whole class saw
the first showing of it. We did all sorts of things like that, so we were given
wonderful stuff. The class was mostly boys. There were girls in the class, but
it was mostly the boys who led the class.
When it came to deciding where to go, we all had to go and see our
counselor. The boys I hung out with got scholarships to Harvard and Yale
and Princeton. Schools like that were working to bring in ghetto kids at that
time, Jewish ghetto kids particularly. This was right after Gentlemen’s
Agreement was a film, and the colleges were beginning to open up, so there
was place for people.

30

I went, and the counselor said, “What do you think you want to do?”
And I said, “Well, I don’t know. I guess I want to go to college.”
He said, “What college do you want to go to?”
I said, “I don’t know. I guess Brooklyn College.”
He said, “That’s a good idea. What will you be?”
I said, “I don’t know. I guess I’ll be a teacher.”
He said, “That’s a good idea.” And that was the end of my college
counseling.
So I did get to Brooklyn College. I aced the entrance exam. I was
seventeen and a half. It was 1952.
Herzenberg: [00:41:15] Anyway, I got to college. Everyone in the family thought I should
go to college. There was nobody saying, “No, she should go get married.”
That was not really what the line was. I had lots of boyfriends. I was very
cute and had different kinds of boyfriends, very different. I probably liked
the more abusive ones more as I look back over it but never really hung
with them because I wouldn’t allow myself to be abused, but they were
interesting. “Abusive,” meaning ones who thought they would get into
positions of power, moving towards what they considered powerful.
One in particular organized me to work for his father for a summer.
One summer I worked folding dresses in a small retail dress shop. That was
awful, I hated that, and they didn’t like me either because I couldn’t keep my
mind on that. I was more interested in “Look at the design,” or whatever it
was.

31

So the next summer I worked for Freddy’s father, and that was an
extremely bad experience. Freddy’s mother ran their insurance business out
of their home, but she was away for the summer. So my job was to come in
in the morning and go to Freddy’s apartment, which took me about half an
hour on the train or so.
In the beginning, it was fine. Then his father started meeting at the
door without any pants on and all sorts of stunts and chasing me around the
house. And I was too embarrassed to tell my mother what was happening.
My father would have gone and killed him. You know, you just were so
embarrassed you didn’t know what to say. I would call my girlfriend and say,
“What am I going to do? What am I going to do?” So I started taking my
girlfriends to work with me. I did everything.
There was this boy in the neighborhood who really liked me, and he
said, “I’m going to kill that bastard.” I had told him what was happening.
“No, I need the money.”
So Freddy’s father never actually did manage to do anything to me,
because I was faster than him. He was a small guy. He couldn’t really
overpower me. But it was like a real experience of knowing what it was to
be chased around the block very lewdly and very embarrassingly. He was a
little bit afraid I would tell his son what was going on, too, so he wasn’t
quite there in terms of this, and eventually the job terminated somewhere in
mid-August. I just had enough. And nobody made me go back. But I just
couldn’t tell my parents what he was doing, and I really understand where
these kids come from, but it really was that kind of experience.

32

Finally I started college. Brooklyn College was a coed college. It was
not a boys’-college-turned-coed college. It was coed from the beginning. It
was a great place. Nevertheless, the girls were there to knit socks and the
boys were there to get an education, and I was not a socks-knitting girl. I
knew how to knit socks. I knit beautiful socks. [laughs] Freddy got me to go
down on a fraternity weekend one year. I remember riding down on the
train knitting the socks.
[telephone interruption]
Kiefer: So to continue with Brooklyn College as you began school there—
Herzenberg: [00:44:57] First of all it was scary. As I’d said, I was spoiled by my parents
because they did a lot of my education. So as big as my high school was, it
was tiny compared with seeing this huge mob of people. It was hard to kind
of flow in. I didn’t really know what I wanted to be in any sense. I didn’t
even have a feel. I mean, I had excelled in high school in creative writing. I
hung out with the math team although I was never on the math team. I did
student time in the biology lab helping us to prep for classes.
So I had all of these interests, and I landed in Brooklyn College. Now
I’m trying to decide what am I going to do. You have no counselors, you
have no real guidance, nobody knows you, no one knows what you should
do. I don’t have any family members who ever went to college, except for
my brother, and he was at that time at LIU [Long Island University]. He
finished LIU. So he gave me some guidance, but he really didn’t exactly
know what to guide me with. Actually, I wound up guiding him and finding
an opening for a job for him in the psychology lab that ultimately led him

33

into getting a Princeton PhD in psychology and into academics. So I was
probably more of a guide for him than he for me. [laughs]
So I was kind of lost, and I decided to take, in my first year, biology,
English, and math, which is pretty standard. My English teacher turned out
to be a homosexual drunk. No, not bad, not bad. He was a very good guy
and quite talented, but he liked the boys. He didn’t dislike girls and he was
not attacking to girls. In fact, he kind of put them up on a pedestal. But it
was more boys who hung around him than girls. He wasn’t drunk during
the week in class, but he would invite people to his house, and he would get
drunk, and you could come to his house. I went a couple of times. Nothing
bad would happen there. It was kind of like if you could be that way, that’s
how it was good to be. So we were lucky to meet him.
The math teacher was a disaster. I took statistics, and all he talked
about was baseball statistics. He had no use for a girl in his class. Biology,
on the other hand, was an excellent program, and so I gravitated much more
solidly to that.
There was something called the Society of Biology and Medicine that
I joined because you could join it. It cost a dollar to join or something like
that. The Society was formed so that people who were headed to medical
school would be able to say they belonged to a Society that was interested in
biology and medicine. But it actually was run by a few people with serious
interests in biology and medicine. They understood about graduate school,
and the professors were very good about this. Some of them were, very,
very good.

34

Len [Herzenberg] and his buddy Jerry Schiff and another guy named
Billy Aaron are the three I really remember from there, and they all got
PhDs. They all went on into academics as research scientists. Jerry taught at
Brandeis for years. Len, you know. And Billy Aaron was at Friday Harbor.
There were some women in the group, and this is where the story
gets interesting. As a freshman I was very excited to belong. The big thing
about biomed, as it was called, was that biomed had an office. It had halfsized classrooms, half width. You had double modules and single modules.
It was a single-module office, and we had some desks in there, and a place
by the window where you could sit on the radiator or air conditioning,
whatever it was. That was my favorite perch.
You could bring your books and stuff in there, you could hang your
coat on a hook, and you had a home. When you came in in the morning,
you didn’t have to hang out at the lounge, which is what most people did,
but I found it not possible for me. There were too many of the girlie girls in
the lounge, and I didn’t relate to them or to the whole sexual marketplace
that was going on in there.
I wanted knowledge and I wanted to learn. I had been brought up
that way in my family. My father and mother took me to every museum in
New York. When they kept me out of school it was to do something
educational, so either it was to go around with my father when he was
driving around the city and could teach me all day long, or it was to go with
my mother to one of the museums or something else, a Broadway show or
whatever she thought was culturally worthwhile.

35

So BioMed was more like home for me, and it was that for both men
and women---boys and girls, as we called ourselves at that time.
In the spring we had a social where we sold plants to raise money for
a scholarship to send someone to a summer course. Usually people chose
the Woods Hole, Massachusetts, summer course. We had access to a
greenhouse, and the greenhouse professor was glad for us to grow the
plants. So we would care for them throughout the year and then have a
plant sale usually right before Mother’s Day. This was how we made money
for our scholarship fund. After that we’d have a big banquet to give out the
scholarships. So as a freshman, I got recruited into this.
My advisor was Jerry Schiff, who was Len’s [Leonard Herzenberg]
best friend. I liked him and could come to him at the club and say, “What
class should I take?” Or, “I don’t understand this thing. Can you explain?”
If it was botany he could explain anything. The advisors were there for you
as older brothers and sisters.
Before the scholarship banquet, I said, “What can I do to help?”
They said, “You can help by being responsible for the cocktail party,”
which actually meant buying and putting out nuts and pretzels before the
dinner. I think the whole event was nonalcoholic because it was in the
school lounge.
I got assigned to work with Len, whom I hardly knew. He had a car,
and so he was going to drive and get the nuts and pretzels, and I was to be
his helper. I really enjoyed it. We had a very, very nice time doing that. He
was interesting to talk to and fun.

36

I had a boyfriend at the time who was on the fencing team at NYU,
and we were kind of breaking up, but it wasn’t anything. My parents were
not particularly in love with Martin. He was a nice guy, but they thought he
was rather strange. They were right. But he was beautiful. He was probably
the most beautiful guy I ever went with. [laughs]
Anyway, Len and I bought the nuts and pretzels and put them all out
at the party. Then one of the girls in the club came over to me and said
something like, “You don’t know it, but some of the boys and some of the
girls are attached. There are all sorts of things you don’t know about. You’re
just a freshman.” Bottom line, stay away from the boys in the club. Which
one of them was I supposed to stay away from? They’re all my friends. I had
no idea.
So the following Monday, I went to Betty. She was a straight arrow. I
said, “Betty, who was I being told about here?”
She said, “This girl thinks that Len is her special prize and that he
belongs to her, and anyone who sits next to him, she carries on about. Since
you were helping him do stuff for the party she was probably picking on
that. Don’t worry about it. Just forget it.”
Well, of course, I did worry about it, and I made sure to stay away
from Len as far as I could stay, which was pretty far. So he didn’t find me.
Then I got poison ivy and was out of school for two weeks just
before finals. My problem was that I needed somebody to help me get
through my statistics exam because I wasn’t very strong on it to begin with,
and then with having two weeks out I was way behind. This professor was

37

not about to give me even a break. So I asked Jerry if he would help me, and
he said, “I don’t know much statistics, but Len does.”
I said, “Well, never mind. That’s OK.” [laughs]
But somehow Len came looking for me, found me, and said, “I heard
you needed some help.”
I couldn’t very well say, “Oh, I’m not going to do this with you.”
Anyway I liked him. He was a very nice guy. So he started tutoring me, and I
guess within a couple of weeks we realized (as much as anyone can realize at
that age) that we were very compatible and just basically fell in love.
Kiefer: He was a senior and you were a freshman?
Herzenberg: [00:55:52] He was a senior and I was a freshman. I often say it was probably
my parents who picked Len for me. He was the boyfriend I brought home
who they thought was the one I’d be best off with. They liked him.
And Len was very fun. After we went out a couple of times his
greatest interest in response to “What should we do tonight?” was to go
home to my house and play gin rummy or bridge with my parents. This kind
of social card playing was a big thing in our culture.
Len and I just hung out together from that time on. We got through
finals, I passed statistics. Being together was just easy. “Where are you
going? I’ll pick you up. We’ll go to school,” et cetera.
We used to go back to his house, because his mother was not there in
the afternoons. I would do my homework and he would help me, but he
also would do whatever he had, too. We could kiss each other in the house,
and there was nobody to see us doing it.

38

We used to listen a lot to Iolanthe, to Gilbert and Sullivan. That was
our idea of a great date. [laughs] We’d sit close to each other. But anyway
that was fun.
Len won the club scholarship, so he got to go to Woods Hole for the
summer. That meant he was going away, first to Woods Hole and then to
Caltech, where he’d chosen to go to graduate school. We had a solution to
being separated (I think it was Betty, again, who organized this for us). Girls
could come up to Woods Hole and make beds in the student dormitories.
The students were exclusively male that year (probably always). The dorms
always needed chambermaids. After making beds you could hang out at the
library, in the classrooms, whatever you wanted to do. A number of young
women like me got in. We slept in a dormitory, and it was all very
straightforward. We got room and board in exchange for the bed-making.
Do you know what Woods Hole is?
Kiefer: It’s a lab in Massachusetts.
Herzenberg: [00:58:17] Yes. It was the summer biology community. Everybody, the very
famous biologists and these people would come, and they would have labs
there or they’d read in the library or whatever they did. But they would go to
Woods Hole for the summer. It was the equivalent of going to the
Hamptons or something if you were rich.
Kiefer: Did they have women students there, or did the women. the bed-makers,
also get to observe?
Herzenberg: [00:58:50] The women were the bed-makers. There were no women in the
class. But the professors didn’t care if I wanted to hang out with Len while

39

he was in class. I got dorm work done early and then came to the
laboratory.
Len and I did a research project there. We had clams and would drop
some starfish extract on them. This made the clam’s heart beat very quickly.
Actually, they were pectins, and starfish were their predators. It would make
the pectins active when you dropped the extract into them. We were just
observing the response, quantitating it. Basically we were learning the
species and learning all the invertebrate stuff. And whatever Len was
learning he was teaching to me. So for us the beginning of our academic life
was when I got up to Woods Hole.
My parents were shocked, because I would never sleep at anybody
else’s house, but I just took off and went to Massachusetts for the summer.
My father said he was waiting for the call, “Come and get me,” because I
wouldn’t even sleep at my Aunt Ruth’s house. But I went up there and I just
stayed, because that was where I belonged, and it fit. I was liberated from
Brighton, from New York, from all this stuff that was there.
I spent another year at Brooklyn College, but Len and I got formally
engaged by the end of the summer. He gave me a small ring, and his mother
had a fit. She said, “You’ll change your mind.”
He said, “No, I don’t think I will.”
She wanted him to marry a rich girl, that was the problem, somebody
with breeding and culture, which my parents did not ever aspire to. [laughs]
They aspired to education. It was a different thing, knowledge. That was not
in Annie’s book. She wanted Len to “marry well”. But Annie was a great

40

woman, she really was, and I wear her own engagement ring to this day. It
was very precious to her, but she gave it to me a couple of years before she
died. She said, “I want to know you’re going to wear it.”
Kiefer: How lovely.
Herzenberg: [01:00:44] This was her prized possession in her life. She had worked during
the depression to earn the money for it, even before she met Len’s dad and
got engaged to him. She married very late for a woman at that time because
she loved her work. She was a legal secretary and really ran the whole office,
even then.
Kiefer: So at the end of that summer, Len went off to Caltech and you remained at
Brooklyn College.
Herzenberg: [01:00:54] Right.
Kiefer: You must have missed him.
Herzenberg: [01:01:02] Well, it was three dollars a minute to make a phone call from
New York to California in those dollars, not our dollars, so I don’t know
what you’d figure. It was about fifty dollars a minute. So you didn’t call, you
wrote. We wrote letters at least twice a week. We’d go back and forth with
letters. I did miss him, but I knew what I was doing, and that’s where I was
going. I was supposed to spend three years and finish college, and he would
spend three years and finish graduate school, and then we would get
married.
But after about three months apart this didn’t make any sense. I
enjoyed being home with my parents. I had no real reason to feel I had to
go out and date. I just was not interested in dating. But he was worried that

41

I would, which he didn’t want. And he was lonely out there, very lonely.
There were couples and there were non-couples, but he was neither.
Somewhere around October or November he said, “OK, we’re going
to get married, and I’ve got it all organized. I can save this much money.
You’ve saved some. We can do it.” Len had one of the first US government
fellowships. Out of the fellowship stipend he got for the first year he saved
enough money so that with the fellowship continuing we could manage to
live the second year (and a third, as it happened).
Despite the cost, Len’s mother had a twenty-minute phone call with
him trying to argue him out of getting married, but it didn’t work. She
couldn’t convince him.
My parents told her, “We don’t have to have a big wedding. We can
have a small wedding. When he comes out here you can have this
discussion.” My parents took the position, “They can do what they want.”
Annie, bless her soul, came from this Flatbush middle-class group, all
her friends, they had “money”. Each one had a wedding or bar mitzvah, and
when you had that everybody brought large checks. She’d given large checks
to all her friends’ kids, and she now wanted to collect them back. Len was
her only son, and she wanted the pomp and circumstance. She loved pomp
and circumstance.
Somewhere during the discussions, after my parents suggested that
we wait until Len comes back for the summer and then decide, Annie
thought about it and said, “No, I’m not going to convince Len otherwise. I
bless them. Let them get married.” And she had an engagement party for

42

me with all of her family and mine. She ordered a beautiful heart-shaped
cake because my birthday’s right next to Valentine’s Day. She acquiesced,
and I became very much part of the family. She never really complained, but
she never did fully approve of me, at least until many, many years later.
Annie bought me the kind of [calling] cards they had at that time. I
still have them. They were cards with “Mrs. Leonard A. Herzenberg” on
them. [laughs] And you were supposed to send them. I used them to thank
everybody for the gifts, and the rest of them I never used again. After
writing my “thank you” notes I had no place to use a calling card like that.
She imagined that’s what academic people would do, but nobody ever did
anything like that.
So that’s how we wound up getting married, being in touch with
ourselves, and then just driving out to Caltech the next season. That was the
beginning of my real education.
Kiefer: So that was the second half of your sophomore year.
Herzenberg: [01:04:43] Well, you see, my freshman year started in February, I graduated
early from high school. You could do that. I started second semester, so I
ended formal schooling with a year and a half. Then because Len’s mother
said, “She’ll never finish her degree, and she’s got to finish her degree,” I
enrolled in Pomona College.
Kiefer: That’s one of the Claremont Colleges, correct?
Herzenberg: [01:05:11] One of the Claremont Colleges. And at that time, to drive from
Pasadena to Claremont, (there were no freeways), you just drove down the
equivalent of El Camino here and went through the various towns, sort of

43

like 101 used to be. But they had the very thick tule fogs and I had to drive
that distance. I didn’t have a problem with driving except driving through
those awful fogs to get there. Fortunately, I met a young Jewish refugee
from Ukraine who was also going to the school. She lived halfway between
my house and the school. So I would drive to her house, and then we’d
drive together through the fog, which was a lot better.
But the big problem with Pomona was that they were teaching us
how to do gram stains, staining bacteria to classify them by the method of
the class. The biology was lame. The curriculum at the time was very old
and was basically aimed at teaching lab techs and people who would never
become biologists. My organic chemistry was great, and history was OK,
but the rest of it was disaster.
I would drive to school and then come home to Len’s lab at Caltech,
where I would spend the rest of the day until the gang went to dinner.
Caltech and the lab was where real science was for me. This was when Jim
Watson had just come back to Caltech. There were, I think, amongst our
teachers, five future Nobel Prize winners. The most exciting, vibrant biology
and genetics was going on at that time.
There was also politics. Our group at Caltech was fighting the
Tenney Committee, which was the equivalent of the McCarthy committee in
California. Everything going on was in that community, in that one Caltech
building called Kirchhoff. George Beadle was our chair, the professors, our
scientific guides. The most exciting political leadership was from a guy

44

named Matt Nesselson, who, like most of the other people in the group,
later became very, very famous for molecular and biochemical studies.
So I got into -- was in -- that community. My schooling was
something outside that. I just simply had to pass exams. And after one
semester of doing this Len and I realized that we were paying for me to go
and do something which was really stupid, and it was expensive. I wasn’t
learning anything. I was learning was when I came back to Caltech and went
to the lectures and listened to the grad students and professors talk.
So I left Pomona. I don’t know what they thought of me at Caltech. I
can’t even imagine what they would think of this eighteen-year-old, and
that’s all I was. I was 18 1/2. I was tiny and had a “mouth.” I was
everywhere. What they thought of this, I don’t know. I know I loved it.
There was a woman named Mary Emerson, who was the wife of
Professor [Sterling] Emerson. Mary worked in the lab and collaborated with
her husband. I know that she worried what would happen to me. She was
motherly towards me in that sense, feeling that they ought to do something
with me and that I should continue to get a formal education. So she
encouraged me to ask whether I could sit in on the classes. I did, and the
response was good. They said I could informally take the labs and the
classes. Caltech didn’t admit women at any level at the time. They said that
if I took the exam for a class I could have a letter from the professor saying
what grade I’d gotten on the exam and how I’d done in the class.
It was great. They treated me like a regular student. It was hard but
fun. There were only two undergraduates who did biology, so there really

45

wasn’t an undergraduate program. It was all graduate school classes that the
two Caltech undergraduates and I attended.
Kiefer: In biology or the school itself?
Herzenberg: [01:09:36] In biology. There were lots of engineering undergraduates, but
there were two who had a biology major. I was thrown into that category, so
now there were three of us. You were just treated like a graduate student
because it was a class. There were ten graduate students in the class, and
there were two or three undergraduates, and you just simply did what the
graduate students did because that’s what you’re expected to do.
So I started my graduate education without ever having finished my
undergraduate. I never got formal credit for the classes, but I had letters
from Max Delbrük [biophysiology] and Henry Borsook biochemistry, Ray
Owen [immunobiology] and others saying I had gotten A’s in my classes.
Ray Owen considered himself my graduate professor. I was very proud to
“belong” to him, and somehow he was always proud that I considered him
my professor. He’s still alive but he’s nearly 100 years old now.
Kiefer: Ray Owen, did you say?
Herzenberg: [01:10:42] Owen, yes. He reappears in my narrative as I go along.
Kiefer: Did you ever work with Jim Watson [co-discovered structure of DNA,
Nobel Prize]
Herzenberg: [01:10:53] I knew Jim Watson. [laughs] At the time he would say he was not
a socially “apt” person. I think he’s never really become an apt person even
though he’s very famous, highly respected and has accomplished a

46

tremendous amount. [laughs] Jim taught one of the classes that I remember
taking. So, yes, Jim was around.
Len’s professor was Herschel Mitchell. He was very good. I would
hang out with him and Len. He was divorced and remarried, and he
remarried a biologist. She worked with him at the lab, Mary Hoolihan. I
could say what I wanted to him, even argue. Despite being a pseudostudent, I was not put down or told not to talk.
The department put me to work for Albert Tyler [biology] who
needed a technician and secretary. He didn’t know what to do with me,
since I was always asking questions. He didn’t have a clue at that time as to
how to handle this. [laughs]
I hung out for lunch with Ed Lewis [Edward Lewis, genetics, Nobel
Prize] and his grad students, who worked just down the hall. I don’t know
who else. I’m just naming various names.
Kiefer: Did Caltech at the time have just men in the student body?
Herzenberg: [01:30:42] That’s right. Undergraduate and graduate.
Kiefer: And the faculty was mixed, if Barbara McClintock was teaching there.
Herzenberg: [01:30:50] Barbara McClintock, well, she was not on the faculty. I don’t
think the faculty had any women. We had a woman postdoc. That was an
unusual thing. A couple of women postdocs, as a matter of fact. But there
weren’t any women faculty members in biology at that time. There were
women who were very well respected in the department and doing research,
but they were research associates of some kind. I don’t exactly know what
position they had.

47

Mary Emerson was one of the women across the way from us, and
they were all throughout the school. There were a number of…and
Marguerite Vogt was there. She worked with Dulbecco [Renato]. I
eventually shifted to working for her and Dulbecco. I washed dishes for
them. Marguerite was, again, the same thing. She wasn’t on the faculty.
Kiefer: Was there encouragement for you or were there some roadblocks for your
presence there?
Herzenberg: [01:31:50] There were no roadblocks for my presence. No, it was very
encouraging. Everyone in the department was happy that I could find a job
there. They let me into all the classes, and they were very, very encouraging.
All the way through I was just a fixture in the department. I
belonged there. You know, when I look at it I say, “How could they do
that?” Nowadays you’d have to be official to hang out there. It was nothing
official. I was just allowed to do this.
Various professors knew me, and I’m sure they talked about me.
They clearly they recognized that I was very bright and wanted to learn, that
I was learning, and they took it as their responsibility to educate me because
it’s our responsibility as professors to educate people. I grew up the same
way and I do the same thing in my labs.
Kiefer: Sure.
Herzenberg: [01:12:22] Caltech was an incredible place. But the most important person
for me was Barbara McClintock [Cytogenetics]. Barbara was this tiny little
woman. She was littler than me, and I was little. She washed dishes in a
restaurant in order to be able to make enough money so she could grow her

corn and do the corn genetics that she was doing, because women just
didn’t get in anywhere.
On the other hand, George Beadle, who was the chairman of our
department, recognized how brilliant she was and what she was doing. So he
somehow invited her to Caltech. I don’t know the whole story there. But he
invited her to Caltech, and she became a legend there. She was at that time
about forty-five, I guess. She seemed very old to me. The joke always at
Caltech was that there were nine professors of genetics in the department,
which was headed by George Beadle, and George Beadle had to teach the
undergraduate class. [laughs] So they were all geneticists, in other words.
But when it came to McClintock, it was said that Andy Anderson
[E.G. Anderson], who was the corn geneticist, understood McClintock’s
work, that McClintock talked to Andy and then he to everyone else.
Everyone else talked to Andy, that they didn’t understand her. She was up
on a pedestal even among all of these biologists.
On a Friday night Len and I used to drive to Los Angeles to get a
Chinese meal because you couldn’t get Chinese food in Pasadena. [laughs]
So we’d always drive down there and then we’d hang out at the music bars,
Dixieland jazz, mostly. We wanted to invite her. We stood outside her door.
The place was all dark. Everybody was gone, and there was a light beam
coming from her door. And if you can picture these two kids going up to
the edge of the light beam and standing in the shadow of the light, and my
saying, “Let’s invite her to go with us.”
And Len saying, “Well, but she might be busy.”

49

“No, no. Let’s.” I was talking this quiet way because we didn’t want
her to hear us. “But maybe she’d like to go.”
“Yes, but we shouldn’t interrupt her. She’s busy. Look, she’s writing
notes.” We could see her.
I said, “Yes, but maybe she’d really like to go. We could ask her, and
if she doesn’t want to go, she will say. We’ll say it in a way that she could say
no.”
So we finally got the courage up, and we knocked at her door. “Dr.
McClintock.” It was eight-thirty, I guess. “We’re going to drive into Los
Angeles and get some Chinese food. Would you like to come?”
“Oh, I’d love to come.” [laughter]
So we took her in to Los Angeles, and we went to this seedy Chinese
restaurant that we always went to that had good food. It was really nice
talking to her, but I was so naïve that I actually said, very simply, “How do
you make all these fantastic discoveries?” That’s an odd question to ask a
famous scientist, but I was young enough not to know that.
And she said, “Well, it’s actually very simple. I go along doing my
regular genetics, and I classify everything and I make hypotheses and I
continue with this. But sometimes I find something that absolutely doesn’t
fit into anything that I can think of. So then I repeat it to make sure that it’s
repeatable and it’s real. And if that’s true, I store it in my brain as an
exception. I keep a lot of these exceptions, and whenever another exception
turns up, I scan it against all the exceptions that I have. Then I get little
clusters of exceptions that seem to relate to one another, and finally they

50

suggest some theory, and they suggest an experiment. Then I do the
experiment. And if the outcome fits, a theory click into place and I’ve made
the finding.”
It’s all very simple. In fact, it’s how I work. I’ve worked that way all
my life. She just taught me in that one minute what you do. But that is a
very unusual way of working for a lot of scientists. So you can classify
scientists. There are those that are paradigm breakers. There’s a book on
this. It’s called the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and it’s Kuhn [Thomas S.].
Everybody knows that book. It’s well known amongst people who look at
things like this.
But anyway some years later I found that book and said, “Oh, this is
an exact description of what we do.” But the point was that Barbara
McClintock just gave me the code, and being given the code by someone
who was highly respected, and I said, “OK, that’s the way you do science.”
So there are those who are paradigm breakers, that’s what’s in this
Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and there are those who are paradigm
extenders, solidifiers, fixers, cementers. Most scientists are the second type.
They don’t like to live in the edge of the unknown,where you’re actually
watching for something that breaks a basic paradigm. They’re happy if they
can show that this gene actually does these two things and not just this one
thing. That’s OK. But developing a new paradigm, saying that there’s a new
kind of genetic material that has not been known before, that kind of
paradigm breaking is really only for a few scientists who do it. And you
don’t need to do that type of paradigm breaking to win Nobel Prizes. In

51

fact, most of the Nobel Prizes have gone to people who have created a
whole new field but not necessarily made the paradigm-breaking
observations. So that’s the area I like to be in, and it’s put me on the outs
with most of my colleagues most of my life. Not only was I a woman, but I
was a woman who dared to do this kind of stuff and argue this way.
Kiefer: To be a paradigm breaker.
Herzenberg: [01:19:54] Yes. To be very simple, I got the idea that there is not a stem cell
for the hematopoietic system, there’s more than one stem cell, a different
one for the cells I work on and the cells that comprise most of the immune
system. This really drove us and a lot of other people to spend twenty, thirty
years to actually prove it. I postulated it together with Len somewhere back
in the eighties, and we just proved it this year. But now it’s “always been
that way”. Everybody, it seems, always knew this was true. [laughs]
Kiefer: So was Barbara encouraging to you? Would you say she was like a mentor?
Herzenberg: [01:20:36] She wasn’t a mentor. I saw her several more times while she was
visiting at Caltech but not in any special way. But she was a mentor in that
she was the person, a woman, who told me how to do what I wanted to do
with my life and how to do it. I would go and see her whenever I happened
to be somewhere where she was. This happened four or five times. I’d
knock on her door and I’d say, “Dr. McClintock, you may not remember
me.”
“Oh, I remember you. You took me to that Chinese restaurant.”
[laughs]
Kiefer: Perfect.

52

Herzenberg: [01:21:10] I never asked her if she remembered the question I’d asked her. I
was too embarrassed to ask such a question, but she probably did remember
and was probably bemused, not just going to the Chinese restaurant but by
these two Jewish ghetto kids from New York. We spoke with New York
accents, and we knew nothing of the rest of the world. We were learning it
fast, but we were ghetto kids.
There were people at Caltech from all over. There were corn people,
and some of them were third-generation academics at Caltech. It was the
most elite place you could be at the time. That’s why Len was sent there.
His professors at Brooklyn College, particularly Priscilla Pollister, told him,
“This is the school you have to go to. I don’t care if it’s across the country.”
They were amazed that he could get in, and they really felt, and rightly, that
one of theirs had really made it.
Kiefer: So the Nobel Prize winners that were there in the course of your time were
Jim Watson and…
Herzenberg: [01:22:18] Jim Watson, Max Delbrük, George Beadle, Ed Lewis. Who else?
Barbara McClintock, too.
Kiefer: Was Jacques Monod there?
Herzenberg: [01:22:29] Jacques was not there. Jacques had been there before we came.
When it was time for us to move on (time for Len to graduate and do a
postdoc), we decided on France as our next stop. I had a French girlfriend
whom I was trying to arrange to come and stay with me. She’d grown up in
the house behind my house in Brooklyn, which was very strange, because, as

53

I said, the whole neighborhood was Jewish. There were only a couple of
other kids.
My friend’s backyard and our backyard abutted, and my mother liked
her mother. So we, as ten-year-olds, became friends, and I was in their
house as much as I was in my house for two years until they moved away.
But Claude and I kept in touch. She had some real tragedies. Her father had
left her mother, and there was a mess. I mean, things like this didn’t happen,
but they happened to her. Her mother went back to France and took her
and her sister with her.
I was trying to arrange for Claude to come back to the States in some
way and stay with us until she could go back to school or do what she was
going to do. That fell through. At the same time, Len was trying to think of
where to go next. Herschel Mitchell, his professor, said, “Well, why don’t
you go to Monod’s laboratory in Paris. That would be really good. Two
other people from here went there as postdocs”
So Len came back and said, “Let’s go to Paris.” I thought, that’s
fantastic, because I would see Claude and we’d be able to get ourselves
going. So we went from Caltech to Paris and to Monod’s lab.
I’ve just finished reading a wonderful, wonderful description of
Monod from 1930-something onward, of his life and his major part in the
anti-Nazi Resistance in Paris. [Brave Genius by Sean B. Carroll] The book
covers the period from the thirties to the sixties, till just a while after we left
Paris. It’s an incredible biography of Monod with Camus. Way later than
that, after we came back out here to California, I got interested in Camus

54

and Existentialism, and I started reading all of Camus. I don’t remember
that I knew that Monod was friends with him. Camus had died before we
got to Paris, so it might not have been talked about that much.
Anyway, Len and I land in Paris. I’m pregnant by this time,
intentionally. We’d been married 2-3 years. You’ve got to have a baby. You
had to have your kids at that time. So we decided after graduate school we
would try and get pregnant. I was pregnant by the time we left New York.
We sailed on the old Normandie because you couldn’t go by plane.
That just didn’t happen. You had a trunk to carry. You went the cheap way,
lowest class on the Normandie.
Kiefer: This is what year?
Herzenberg: [01:25:35] This is 1955. Yes, ’53 to ’55 is Caltech, and ’55 to ’57 is Paris.
I have a wholly new perspective on those Parisian years after having
read this book about Monod. Maybe one of the saddest things about me
losing Len was that this book came out after he passed away. We would
have read this book out loud to one another, and we would have enjoyed it
enormously because it’s an understanding of Jacques that we didn’t have.
When we got to Paris Len said, “You like to paint, you like to do art,
you like to do writing. Why do you want to hang around the lab?”
And I said, “I just want to go to the lab. I don’t want to do anything
else.” [laughs]
He took pity on me. I was pregnant. He said, “OK, OK, come to the
lab if Monod will say OK.”

55

So I went to Jacques and I asked him. He said, “Of course you can
do that.”
Jacques was in the lab a lot. We saw him every day whenever he was
in residence in Paris, which was most of the time at that time.
Kiefer:

When you went to France, what institute or university were you connected
with?

Herzenberg: [01:33:16] None at the time. Pasteur Institute is itself, and Monod had his
laboratory there. In France, if Monod said you could work in the lab, you
could work in the lab. That was the end of that.
So I worked with Len all the time, except on one great project that I
decided to do by myself. Len thought it was crazy. Funny project. [laughs]
In Monod’s lab, we worked with something called galactoside. It’s part of
lactose. It’s just sugar, and bacteria will grow on the sugar. But if you
substitute sulfur for one of the oxygens, it’s called a thiogalactoside and
Jacques had said, “Nothing will grow on a thiogalactoside. It just won’t
grow.” That was true, so far as we knew. We didn’t sterilize any of our
solutions. We just dissolved the thiogalactoside into solution. We never had
a problem with it. Nothing ever grew on it. It was very central to the work
we were doing. Everybody in the lab was working with it. There were
several thiogalactosides and you never sterilized any of them.
I said, “But Herschel Mitchell [Len’s Caltech professor], said
something will grow on anything. So I went outside and scooped a handful
of dirt and put it in a flask and put some water in it, and put the flask in the

56

cupboard. I used sterile water so I would know if whatever grew came from
the dirt, and I put the flask in a cupboard.
Two weeks, four weeks later, I don’t know, I took the flask out and
sniffed it. Hmm. There’s sulfur coming out of this. There’s something
growing in here. [laughs] “Look, Jacques, something grows in the
thiogalactoside.”
“Oh, that’s amazing. That’s really interesting.” [laughs]
Except for one thing. After that time, we had to sterilize all the
galactosides. Everybody did. They were showing it and sniffing it and taking
the plug out. Bacteria got into everything. We had to sterilize all the
solutions after that, so I left my mark permanently on Pasteur in terms of
bacteria in the air. It was funny. [laughter]
Kiefer: That’s interesting.
Herzenberg: [01:35:44] It’s a funny thing to do.
So reading this book now I really got into remembering a lot about
Pasteur, and I asked myself, how did he see me? Why was he so willing? I
was pregnant. When we had the baby, I hung out with the baby at the lab. I
would come in in the afternoons with her, and it was great. Jacques was
around a lot. He’d come into the lab and talk to us a lot. Not that he’d sit
down and talk to people, but he’d just always be talking to us about the
science, about whatever.
I know I can remember explicitly one time. I learned French.
Somebody gave us a housekeeper. We couldn’t afford a housekeeper, but
they said, “If you’ll give her room and board, we’ll pay her salary. We don’t

57

want to lose this housekeeper.” So we had a room upstairs that we could let
her have, what’s called the maid’s room in France.
So Françoise came to work for us. She was my age, maybe a year
older, two years older, something like that. She had been taking care of their
babies, and she spoke only French. So my French had to get better than it
was. I learned to speak French with her and to understand French that way.
Jacques used to push us to speak French, and then he would switch
to English. He was fully bilingual. When he’d get impatient with our halting
French, he’d switch to English, and then you’d tease him, then he’d say,
“Who started speaking English?”
And we’d say, “It was you, Monsieur Monod.”
“Oh, OK, I’m sorry. Back to French.” Jacques was very cute. [laughs]
He was a very sweet guy, a very nice guy, and very bright and broadly
cultured. For example, he had to choose between leading the Pasadena
Symphony Orchestra and staying in science. He was a wonderful cellist.
So one day, I said, “Eh, bien,” with a very country accent to Jacques.
It means “Oh, good, or OK”. I don’t know what I was talking about. It was
a slangy comment that I just said to him.
And he said in a mock shocked voice, “Lee, où avez-vous appris dire ca?”
“Where did you learn to say that?” [laughs] Remembering that interchange is
important because it reminds me of the social nature of the intercourse that
we had with Jacques in the labs. It wasn’t like he only came in and talked to
us about science for a few minutes. He took over the education of the
Americans who were there.

58

We ate lunch in a common dining room. It wasn’t a dining room; it
was one long table that we sat at in a glass-roofed old lab that was converted
to a lunchroom. Everybody ate at this table. It was required. Nobody said
you must, but Jacques and Andre Lwoff, who was even more senior than
Jacques, intended you to do that, and you knew it.
The discussion at the table was often politics. The French scientists,
from Monod down, were all very left-wing but not communist. This was
after the split when the Communist Party—you don’t need that history.
Hitler and Russia made a pact that put them both on the same side. Now,
the French Communists were very anti-Hitler, and so a very large number
of them didn’t really want to follow Russia. They belonged to the party
because the party was what a lot of left wing people, aka liberal now,
belonged. Others were like me, who understood that they should never join
the party but were friends with people in the party. Anyway, most of them
split with the party at this point.
I grew up with this ping-pong game. I have very early memories of
that discussion of should you join the party, and my father saying, “No, it’s
really not a good thing to do, that they don’t, in the end, have the goals you
want to reach, and that’s not going to happen, that they’re going to fool you
into thinking that, and you’re going to be part of the party, and you’re
supposed to go with party discipline and all the rest of it, but it’s bullshit.
Don’t go for it.” So I learned this. My brother said the same thing and kept
me out of party even though I had friends who joined. My family made this

59

kind of politics quite clear to me before I could even really understand. But
as I grew up I wanted to understand it, and when I did I agreed with them.
Right in 1940 there was a big split and a lot of people moved away
from the party at that time. Jean-Paul Sartre remained until after the war
when the Cold War was beginning, and it was very clear to them that the
party was not there.
Paul Robeson went back to Russia because he believed so firmly that
Russia was going to have equality and the working man would be elevated.
It was incredible bullshit, and I knew it because I was reading both sides of
the game, even at that time. Robeson went back there and then he found
the discrimination was horrible. It was worse than anything he’d
encountered, and he came back a broken man. He had been vilified in this
country for being a Communist and for going to Russia, and once that
dream disappeared he returned incredibly depressed. He didn’t commit
suicide, but it would not have been a shock in the condition he was in. It
was really tough.
Kiefer: How many people were there?
Herzenberg: [01:38:55] I like to name off the people in that lab and interacted in this
milieu, because it’s amazing who was there. They all agreed with my family.
Georges Cohen and François Bloch, who became Minister of Science and
France’s top minister, his wife Francoise,later ex-wife. Americans Harlyn
Halverson and George Siskin were the two Americans who were there at
the time. There were always a few Americans in the lab, but I think they
weren’t as interested in the political lunch discussions as I was.

60

We were usually a group of about ten people. We could fit around
this table which had room for about fifteen or sixteen people, and lunch was
at that table all the time. These are all people who became very famous
French scientists. If you were at Jacques’ table you were, or became famous,
or at least did great science.
In the middle of our second year in Paris a draft notice caught up
with us. Len had been drafted and he was way overdue for responding to
the notice. It had been sent by postcard to Pasadena, forwarded through
several offices and finally sent to Paris. It was months since it had been
issued, but finally got to us. Len could be held up for draft evasion.
So we had to just pack up and go back to the US rather quickly so
Len could “report” for duty. This was dreadful. We would just have to stop
doing science, leave the lab we loved, et cetera. Shocked, we went to Jacques
and told him what had happened.
He calmed us and said, “Well, you know, you can go to the NIH and
you can do your service there. If you do that you can continue to do the
science. There’s this guy Harry Eagle, who’s been after me to come and
teach what we’re doing here to his lab. Why don’t you go in my place, m’
boy?”
Len had wanted anyway to work with animal cells. It was really what
his goal was. He really didn’t want to stay long term in bacterial genetics,
although shortly thereafter the studies being done got Jacques the Nobel
Prize. However, at the time we were on the team. We did our part getting

61

towards the famous experiment that resulted in the Nobel Prize. However,
we left before it was done.
Kiefer: And that experiment, roughly speaking, involved what?
Herzenberg: [01:41:56] It’s called the PaJaMo Experiment because it was Pardee, Jacob,
and Monod, the three initials, and it was basically showing that bacteria had
genes and chromosomes and could mate and transfer genetic material. It
started the whole molecular revolution.
We had worked on the system and helped to bring it to the point
where that experiment could be done. In working on our part of the study I
learned kinetic assays and rigorous quantitation. I loved to do plot data and
do mathematical stuff. Len preferred good solid experiments, and I liked to
do the theoretical, the statistical, the plotting of the data, the things like that.
So, particularly after the baby was born, he would do the experiments and
bring the data home to me. Then I would sit down and plot it all out and
find out what the kinetics looked like. I loved that kind of mathematical
stuff. It’s not high-level math. Most people doing this kind of work didn’t
really like doing that, but math of this kind was something my father had
brought me up to do. So it was just a natural extension of where I’d been
before.
It’s an interesting story in terms of where I went from there and my
next publication, actually, which I just happened to notice the other day. It
was 1960 by this time.
Kiefer: So it was 1960, or ’59 or ’60, that you went to the National Institutes of
Health?

62

Herzenberg: [01:43:37] We arrived there at the end of ’59.
Kiefer: And that was in Washington, D.C.
Herzenberg: [01:43:42] Yes, in Washington, D.C.
Before continuing with this, I’ll give you one more comment to do
with Paris. In reading the history of Monod that I mentioned I couldn’t help
wondering “What did Jacques see me as?” I mean, I know what I saw him as,
and the history in the book is exactly as I saw him. It is such a good history
that it is exactly as I saw him, but it filled in enormous numbers of details I
had no idea about. One of them was I had no idea what his wife was like. I
knew that she was a curator of one of the museums there, Musée Guimet. I
didn’t know that she was Jewish.
Anyway, the description of Monod’s wife in this book made me think
that probably Jacques saw me as an American ghetto version of his wife.
There were just things that I saw that I immediately identified with. He was
very, very much a feminist and felt his wife could have a career, and he
supported her. They had twin boys born during the war. She was hidden
away in a small town, and he would visit them during the war. But he was
very busy heading the Resistance. He actually wound up being the head of a
large…you should read this book. I mean, it’s gorgeous.
It’s called Brave Genius.
Kiefer: Brave Genius.
Herzenberg: [01:45:43] Yes. Oh, I can’t recommend it more. I realize that Jacques
believed that young women should be part of science, and he did have a
woman in his department at that time. He would give women a chance to be

63

scientists, and it was not because he was liberal. It was because it was in him
to really look at people, not look at what their labels were. In that sense, I
really saw a lot of my father also in Jacques, and in reading this book I could
see that there’s just this element of personality that looks at people, doesn’t
put labels on them to begin with. Super cool.
Kiefer: That’s wonderful. By the time you went to Washington did you have more
children or did you just have one daughter?
Herzenberg: [01:47:16] When I went to Washington Len and I had decided I should
work for someone else. I should be a laboratory technician. I had a career,
and I needed to get paid. He met one of his Caltech co-graduate students,
and that guy was looking for a technician, and so he arranged for me to
meet Bruce. His name is Bruce Ames. He’s very well-known for the Ames
Test.
Bruce said, “OK, you be my first technician. I’ll make my mistakes
on you.” I said, “Well, you’ll be my first boss. I’ll make my mistakes on you.”
[laughs] I don’t know that we actually said that to each other, but we
probably both thought it.
And Len went to work in Eagle’s lab learning somatic cell genetics,
and I went to work for Bruce. Bruce was still doing bacterial genetics of the
kind that I had done in Paris, and I knew how to do all the stuff that he
wanted me to do. Well, certainly not all. He taught me a lot. He was a good
teacher.
If Len was somewhat organized, Bruce was incredibly organized. He
was a graduate student from the same department, same professor as Len,

64

H.D. Mitchell, but they were very different. Bruce was very organized as he
went through graduate school. He sequentially studied four enzymes in
work that translated easily into a thesis. He worked this one, then he did this
one, then this one, and finally this one. Very organized! Each one was a
paper. Each one was organized, neat, clean.
Len’s thesis was a mess, in contrast. [laughs] At one point towards
the end of it his advisor (H. K. Mitchell) said, “Answer one question. Why
did you do this experiment? It is a very interesting finding, it is extremely
interesting, but why did you do the experiment?”
Len explained, and Mitchell replied, “Well, that’s logical.” But
basically Len agreed, it was a curious although very creative path. He had
spent much of his graduate time sequencing proteins, but he wound up
proving that the putative enzyme he was working on was not a protein at all,
even though everyone initially thought it was a protein. It basically didn’t
make any sense as to how he got the idea that the “enzyme activity” he was
following was actually due to a mixture of fatty acids [laughs]. It was just
brilliant intuition followed by good science to prove the fatty acids were
responsible for the activity. However, at the time the thesis was to be
presented it was not clear which fatty acids were responsible. It would take
months to work this out. So the thesis was a mess.
Mitchell, however, said, “Look, you’re already committed to Paris,
they’re expecting you there, you’ve got to go. Just write up your thesis. I
know you know how to do research. You’ve learned everything you need to
learn, and it’s time to go on.”

65

People have somewhat different attitudes of what a thesis should be.
Some people still think like Mitchell but others, particularly now, think
you’ve got to publish a Nature paper or you don’t have thesis. I don’t believe
in that at all. I would never force a student of mine to do that. If the
University rule is you have to publish a paper. OK, get a paper published. It
has to be good, but it doesn’t have to be acceptable to the Nature editors.
Kiefer: You moved to NIH.
Herzenberg: [01:50:22] You wanted to know about how we did in Washington.
Kiefer: Right.
Herzenberg: [01:50:24] I worked for Bruce and I was his technician. He expected to tell
me what I should do. I agreed. He was the boss. So we did things in the
orderly way he expected. However, I would always be asking questions. He
didn’t think about research in the same way I did. He didn’t have the
McClintock view about exceptions and the need to remember them and
follow up on them. He was, still is, very successful. We just thought
differently.
Len was working upstairs in another building. There were other
people in his lab I got to know. I did my work in Bruce’s lab, but I hung out
around Len’s lab. Following in Len’s footsteps, I was more interested in the
science going on there than I was in the bacterial genetics that Bruce was
working on. I wasn’t uninterested. I didn’t go to sleep at night puzzling
about questions about things I was doing in Bruce’s lab.
Then Bruce went off…I’ve written about this, actually…Bruce went
off to St. Louis to the Kornberg department to spend six weeks there.

66

Again, this was still a time when you couldn’t afford to make a phone call.
Nobody would think of calling someone to ask what to do. So he left me
with, “I’ve synthesized the substrate for this enzyme. Just take this through.
You know how to do it, get all of this information and have it lined up for
me so when I come back we’ll go ahead and we’ll have all four enzymes in
the pathway.” And that was great. He gave me the stuff, and he raced out
the door to go make his train for St. Louis.
I took the stuff in to look at the spectrum of it just to check to get a
feeling on the concentration, and it had the wrong spectrum. I said, “Wait a
minute. This is not the right spectrum. That means it’s not the right
compound. There are no experiments to do. Everything Bruce told me to
do I can’t do because this is not the right compound.” This was catastrophe.
As I said, you didn’t figure that Bruce will be on the train for three days but
when he gets to St. Louis I can call him and say, “What should I do?” You
just didn’t think that way at that time. You didn’t use the telephone that
way.
So instead, I went to one of the other well-known enzymologists,
Alan Mehler, who was in our department and said, “Alan, what should I
do?”
Alan said, “Well, think of something.”
I said, “What do you mean, think of something?”
He said, “Well, do something productive. You’re smart enough to do
it. Just do something productive.”

So I thought for a little bit, and I thought, well, it might be
worthwhile to study the kinetics of the induction of the enzymes Bruce and
I were working on. This goes back to Monod. Like Monod, Bruce and I
were looking at several bacterial genes that were closely strung together on
the chromosome. In this case the genes controlled the synthesis of the
amino acid histidine.
The important thing that Monod had shown was that the linked
genes in the galactosidase system were all coordinately controlled, so that if
you ran out of glucose in the culture and you put lactose in, the lactose
enzymes would all come up. If you ran out of lactose they would go down,
the glucose enzymes would come up. Len and I worked on this quite
intensively. It was the first instance of concomitant regulatory control of the
expression of linked genes on a chromosome.
So in Bruce’s system was there were four enzymes that were known
to be linked. They were close to each other on the bacterial chromosome
and encoded the sequential synthesis of the enzymes Bruce was working on.
Basically, the four necessary enzymes were encoded by linked genes sitting
on the chromosome next to each other just like in the Monod system.
My thought was that these histidine enzymes ought to all be
coordinately controlled. Therefore, if I had a way of starving the culture of
histidine it would force these enzymes to increase to supply the missing
histidine. If it was like the Monod system, they’ll all come up together.
I readily figured out a way to starve the culture. We had tools. I used
one of them. I hadn’t asked Bruce about doing this beforehand, and I was a

68

bit worried. Bruce didn’t really like the Monod stuff. It was too—I don’t
know if flamboyant is the right word—it was too McClintock-ish, you
know. It was like finding a new phenomenon, this regulatory thing. It just
wasn’t his style. He did fantastically good science, but this wasn’t his style.
But not knowing what else to do to fill time until Bruce got home, I
did something that was my style. I threw this stuff that’s called formal
histidine into the histidine deficient medium and grew the cells on it. And,
sure enough, all the histidine enzymes came up together.
As far as I know, this was the second example of a bacterial operon
coordinately controlling the synthesis of bacterial enzymes. Had we
published it right when I found it, it would have been an amazing
verification of Monod’s operon hypothesis. However, publication waited
until someone else, Charles Yanofsky here at Stanford, actually did the same
experiment with a different amino acid before Bruce was comfortable
publishing the work I had started. When I came back from his trip to St.
Louis, he listened to the results I got in his absence and then said, “Oh,
that’s nice. Now I’ll redo the synthesis that failed, and let’s get working on
the enzyme that we needed to do.” He had a commitment to complete the
mechanisms for the four histidine synthesis enzymes, and that needed to get
done first.
This is just how it went. Bruce wasn’t interested enough in
establishing the new paradigm, and I didn’t know enough to do so. I didn’t
know what was going on in the field. I wasn’t reading, and I didn’t even
know this is something the field was looking for. However, Bruce did

69

eventually write a paper describing this and included me as a co-author. This
was the correct and honorable thing to do, but it is not always done. Bruce’s
integrity stands out loud and clear.
Kiefer: And what was the name of the paper again?
Herzenberg: [01:57:27] It’s Ames, Garry, and Herzenberg. [The Genetic Control of the
Enzymes of Histidine Biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium, 1960]
Kiefer: Didn’t you return to the Sorbonne and obtain a doctorate?
Herzenberg: [01:58:32] No, my degree from the Sorbonne was well after I was here at
Stanford, and I wasn’t in residence. You didn’t have to be in residence there
to get your degree. The degree that I have is a doctorat d’Etat en science. You’ll
have the formal name of it [University Paris V (Sorbonne). Doctorate
d’Estes –. Science. 1979-1981. Equiv. D .Sc.-. Immunology.] Basically the
French system at the time was that when you finished doing your initial
research you would apply for funding to continue doing your research from
what was called CNRS [Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]. If
you got this funding you could have your own laboratory and continue to
work and publish as a scientist. You didn’t need a PhD to get funding.
At some point you would apply for the doctorat degree, which would
diplome you to be able to teach in a French university and to have graduate
students. It was like applying for either associate or full professor status. So
you’ve already had your lab. You’ve already had what we would call the
assistant professor’s job here. You’d have your lab. You’re allowed to get
funding to do your research, your report. You do all the rest of that.

70

To qualify for the doctorat degree you had to have a history of really
good publications, and you had to be able to speak French. I had the
publication history and then some; I had more trouble getting someone to
attest that I could speak French. I mean, I could. But you had to prove you
spoke French, which I did.
The more important requirement, really, was that you had to present
a body of work that a jury would look at and decide was the equivalent of
work done by professors in a French university. It was like a tenure review
rather than a PhD exam. It was really a very different system. French
university systems now have a Ph.D. system where you write your thesis just
as we do in the US, based on a few years of graduate work. But at that time
in France you wrote a thesis for your doctorat, which required much greater
accomplishment.
The thesis that I wrote was fun to write. I wrote it on work that I did,
some of it with my own hands, all with my major intellectual participation. I
had students who had worked on major parts of it, but that was OK. What
they wanted was your body of scientific work, work that led and work that
made major scientific contributions.
I wrote the thesis, applied formally for the doctorat degree, was
reviewed by outstanding experts in my field and was awarded the degree
with commendations. I based this thesis on work that was blocked for some
years for funding reasons. I want to go back to this work right now. I’m
certainly very glad I wrote the thesis.

INTERVIEWER:

JOYCE KIEFER

INTERVIEWEE:

LEONORE (LEE) HERZENBERG

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

MAY 21, 2014

Kiefer: This is Joyce Kiefer interviewing Leonore Herzenberg at her home on
Stanford campus. We are continuing the interview that we had last week.
Today is May 21, 2014.
We are going to talk about the time when you and Len [Leonard
Herzenberg] came to Stanford.
Herzenberg: [00:00:27] We went to the NIH in 1957. He had to spend two years there as
a member of the Public Health Service in order to satisfy military obligation.
The end of that term was September 1959. We had to look for where we
were going next, and Len was spoken to by several people at the NIH who
wanted to keep him as a staff scientist, which was quite a good position to
have. Many of our friends were well situated there. The NIH was a very
good place to be.
Len was offered a suite of laboratories one floor away from where we
were in Building 10, and we had decided that was where we would go. This
would have been fall of 1958 when the decision was made. When he
finished his Public Health Service time in 1959, he would switch over to the
civilian NIH. We were happy about this.

72

However, it was Thanksgiving and we planned to go up to New York
City to have Thanksgiving with our parents. I was three- or four-month
pregnant with our second child. We piled the little one into the car and were
ready to go. We said, “We’ll just stop off at the NIH to pick up our mail,”
before we took off for New York.
I didn’t have any mail to worry about particularly. I was working for
Bruce Ames at the time. Len picked up his mail and handed it to me, and we
started driving on. There was an airmail envelope there and we didn’t get
that many airmail letters.
I pulled it open and there was a letter from Josh Lederberg inviting
Len to join his new department here at Stanford. At that time they didn’t do
things like requiring one interview and two interviews and all this stuff that
goes on now. The head of the department decided he wanted you, recruited
you, and if he wanted you he could hire you, and that was that.
We were driving along and this was like a big bomb dropped in the
car. [laughs] Oh, my God, this is a great offer but, no, we had committed to
the NIH job, although there were no formal papers signed yet. We had a
beautiful house that we had bought. We had fixed it up and painted it all
and done all the things you do when you buy your first house. It was really
lovely. We were happy with our lives.
But it was certainly interesting, so we talked about it back and forth.
We had been in Southern California. We had no love of California, because
Pasadena is not a place that you really want to go back to, even though
Caltech was a fabulous place. If Caltech offered Len a job, we probably

73

would have gone back there, but there was no great lure in going back to
California.
Instead we said, “Well, this is really great. It’s certainly an honor to be
invited to join a department that Lederberg is starting.” We had known
Lederberg. We knew that Linus Pauling and Lederberg both were stars in
the firmament at that time. While we were in Paris, both of them actually
had come to visit the labs there, to visit Monod in his lab.
Josh was famous in the Monod lab, actually, for having given a talk in
French, rather halting French, but he gave the talk in French. The joke of it
was that he wanted to say, “On the one hand, I would do this. On the other
hand, I would do that.” There is no such saying in French, but he didn’t
know that, and so he said, “sur un main,” and he put his hand up, and he
said, “sur l’autre main,” and everybody who was in the room kind of went
with their hands the same way in this gesture, and you could see them
translating into English knowing what he said, because everybody there was
fluent in English. The lab language was actually English, although Jacques
was always telling us to speak French. And I think I may have said last time,
that he was always saying, “Why are you speaking English?”
But in any event, Lederberg had definitely distinguished himself that
way. Len had spoken with him when he was there and, I guess, made a
favorable impression. Then when Len was at Harry Eagle’s place, Josh had
come by again and had a rather long talk with Len, which Len really
enjoyed. They just free-ranged over all the kinds of science things they
would have free-ranged over at the time, and Len was very impressed. It

74

was just wonderful to talk to him, because Josh was just such a fertile mind,
incredibly interesting to talk to always, always.
So here was this letter sitting on my lap. We got to New York and
saw the parents. At some point, the two sets of parents were together, and
Len said, “Oh, you know, we got a very big compliment. We got a job offer
in California.”
And Len’s mother’s first statement was, “You’re not going, of
course.” [laughs]
To which he said, “No, no, we decided we’re not going to go.”
We’d come also to New York at that time, besides Thanksgiving,
because there was a meeting of the Federation of American Scientists. We’d
both always been politically involved, and Len actually was running the
Federation office, actually we both were running their office in Washington,
D.C. at this time. I say “running the office.” I mean we were the young
people who picked up the mail and cleaned up the office. The people
running it were Hans Bethe and other very well-known physicists. Einstein
was probably a part of it. I can’t remember that.
The Federation of American Scientists was a kind of leftist
organization. It was peopled by very well-known physicists, including those
who would not sign the Loyalty Oath that universities compliant with
Senator McCarthy’s wishes were making a requirement for continued
appointments. Stanford took a whole physics department from Berkeley at
one swoop because none of them would sign the Loyalty Oath. So the

75

atomic scientists were physicists, were very clearly—they were antiMcCarthy, anti-regimentation from the government, anti-fascist.
Actually, we had done a serious lot of work in establishing that office.
We actually got the organization to recognize that they could get a general
counsel, whose name was Daniel Singer, to be the general counsel and to
really keep the organization together, because he was based in Washington.
Danny Singer was actually Maxine Singer’s husband, and Maxine Singer’s a
very well-known scientist who, I think, eventually headed the Carnegie1. It
was a very sweet little circle that was there, and we were quite happy with
being part of it.
Len went to the FAS meeting, and came home very late. We were
sleeping in my old bedroom at my house, which meant we were sleeping on
a three-quarter bed for the two of us, because there was no room in that
bedroom for a full bed. The house my parents lived in had room for their
double bed in their bedroom, and that was it. The other bedrooms were my
brother’s and mine, and they only had room for singles, with barely a closet.
So we were sleeping in this crowded little bed, and it got to be two o’clock
in the morning.
Actually, I wasn’t sleeping because Len hadn’t gotten home, and I
began to think, “Could something be wrong?” He went to a political
meeting. They last late, but here it is two o’clock in the morning and he’s
not home yet. Finally, he came home and crawled into the tiny bed and said
he was late because he had been talking with Martin Kamen [Manhattan

1

Maxine Singer was the president of the Carnegie Institution for Science from 1988 to 2012.
76

Project physicist]. They had walked all the way down from Columbia
University, which is 121st Street or so, down to the 34th Street subway, and
just talked the entire time. He said, “We talked about the job in California.”
And my answer was, “We’re going, aren’t we?”
And he said, “Yes, we really should.” He started explaining to me
why Martin had said this was the job of the century and you could not walk
past this offer, that Stanford was going to be what it actually became in the
years that followed.
Martin Kamen himself is very well known both as a scientist and
because he was one of the few people the State Department denied a
passport to. This was when Linus Pauling was denied his passport and
Martin was denied his. They were leftists, not communists, but were targets
of the House Un-American Activities Committee.
Although there were all these nice things and interesting political
things to talk about, Len had actually talked his heart out to Martin, and
Martin had said, “You’re crazy. You have to go.” So the decision was made,
and we decided to come here to Stanford.
Josh was pleased and organized for Len to come out to visit that fall
to see the campus and make a final decision, to decide if he wanted to live
here, because Len had told him we didn’t think we’d want to live in
California. And Josh said, “Well, come out and visit.” But the offer was
already made. It was not like, “Come out and we’ll look at you and you look
at us.” The offer was made. It would have had to have been retracted, or we
would have to say no. We were pretty sure we were going. The object of

77

Len’s trip was really to make plans for how we would get here. I couldn’t go
because I had to stay home with my daughter.
Josh had to cancel Len’s visit on the originally arranged date—I think
Len was going to go in November or December. He said, “I have to make a
detour, and so I won’t be coming to campus until January or February, and
we’ll do this then.” That was OK. We found out afterwards the detour was
for Josh to go and collect his Nobel Prize in Stockholm. He couldn’t say,
because it was beforehand.
So there we were. Len went out to visit right around my birthday
(mid-February). It was snowing, it was horrible in Washington, and Len
came out to California and took pictures. The grass was green and
everything was beautiful. Even just for the weather, we were happy to be
able to go. But by that time, we had realized who was out here. The
Kornberg department was already here. Henry Kaplan [radiologist]
entertained Len. At that time, Henry Kaplan was still living in Marin,
because the school hadn’t moved down yet.
Kiefer: So the Stanford med school was still in San Francisco?
Herzenberg: [00:11:49] Well, part of it was always here. The preclinical was here, so Sid
Raffel was here and the basic sciences were here, and [Arthur] Kornberg
had already arrived with his department, and I think that the building was
open enough for Kornberg to be in it by the time he arrived, which was
shortly before us, but there were parts of the building that still weren’t open.
Kiefer: Kornberg was the head of genetics?

78

Herzenberg: [00:12:20] No, Josh [Lederberg] was the head of genetics and Kornberg was
the head of biochemistry. Kornberg came with an intact department that he
had in St. Louis, and then he added people to that, but his primary
department came from St. Louis.
Kiefer: From Washington University?
Herzenberg: [00:12:39] Right. If you remember, I told you a story about how Bruce
Ames had gone out to St. Louis and that he’d gone out to the Kornberg
department. This was a Caltech and Paris axis because people in Kornberg’s
department, Dave Hogness and Dale Kaiser, both came from Caltech, from
the same department we came from. Both had also preceded us in Pasteur.
By the time we got to Paris, we were the third Caltech invasion. We even
took Dale’s apartment in Paris.
Kornberg had also brought Mel Cohn with him from St. Louis. Mel
was Jacques’ closest colleague in many ways, certainly closest American
colleague. Mel was a kind of immunologist, but also a molecular biologist.
He was one of the real attractions for us coming here because he was very
creative, is still a very creative guy, and very interesting. We realized this
when we first met him when he visited Monod and the laboratory in Paris.
Herzenberg: [00:13:57] So the Kornberg department was one of the key attractions here.
We were pleased that there was a closeness in the two departments. Arthur
helped get Josh appointed and the Department of Genetics established. It
was just a very exciting place to come to. There was no question but that
Len would take the job and we would come here.

79

Kiefer: So then just to place you in the proper place, you were part of the med
school and then biochemistry and then the Department of Genetics. Is that
the order of things?
Herzenberg: [00:14:45] Well, biochemistry and genetics were equivalent departments;
both sat on the dean’s whatever committee. They were just separate
departments within the medical school. Josh had a very different concept of
department than Arthur had. Arthur’s was biochemistry, E. coli, and what
we would now call molecular biology, but at that time was DNA. So they
were very much into genes and chromosomes, and Josh was into very
different things. Josh had a very, very broad and very fertile mind that he
dealt in-depth in anything that he did. It was not that he was superficial, but
that he was voracious for new things. And where Arthur really saw that we
had to really understand DNA and genes and how this whole thing was put
together and how the DNA was synthesized and what controlled all of that,
the biochemistry of genetics, if you like. Josh was even at that time probably
interested in epigenetics as well as genetics, meaning the ways in which
genes were integrated with one another, and much else.
Josh was a scientist, as opposed to a biochemist with a specific
mission. Josh was interested in all of science. To be in his department was
either incredibly awful if you wanted to have your nose to one grindstone,
because there was so much going on, or wonderful if you were like Len and
were interested in whatever made things work, how genes were expressed
and interacted in mammals and other complex organisms. It’s a very
interesting question. I don’t know how to describe this.

80

Kiefer: But you and Len felt that this was the atmosphere that you wanted to work
in.
Herzenberg: [00:17:13] We were happy with the genetics department. Len had enough
eclectic interests, if you like, that we were happy with the direction we were
going. Len wanted to do mammalian cell genetics. He wanted to do the
genetics of mammals, but not coat color or other genetically controlled
traits. Rather than simply working out any single mechanism, Len wanted to
understand the whole interactive genome from a genetic standpoint.
Len wanted to do gene transfers between and into human cells. Much
of what has been done over the last fifty or sixty years was stuff that he
wanted to do and envisioned being done. To do this, he was much better
placed in Josh’s genetics department than he would have been in the
Kornberg department.
Actually, Arthur liked Len a lot, and he gave him fatherly advice,
which was, “Why are you wasting your time with mammalian cells? You
should be working on E. coli because there are really important things to be
learned.”
But Len said, “May I respectfully disagree? I know that my tools are
nowhere near as fixed and I don’t have as many colleagues that I can
bounce things off, but I really want to focus on mammalian cell genetics.”
Arthur just did not agree. Now, many years later, Arthur came back
and said, “You know, that was good advice I gave you, but it’s just as well
you didn’t take it.”
Kiefer: I love it. [laughs]

81

Herzenberg: [00:18:57] That was the gist of the conversation.
Kiefer: Now, how were you working with Len at this time?
Herzenberg: [00:19:02] We drove out to California together. We left the kids (our second
daughter was born that spring) with my mother, put the dog in the car and
drove our little Volkswagen across country.
When we first arrived, we stayed with Gladys and Lew Aronow. Lew
was in pharmacology. They were very kind to offer us (and the dog) a
bedroom until we could find a place. I still see Bruce, their son, who is now
a molecular geneticist.
Anyway, we stayed with the Aronow family for a couple of weeks
down in Sunnyvale area, which was all orchards. From there, you had to
drive here to Stanford by what became 101, but was just at that time a
typical two-lane-with-shoulders road, no houses, and just lovely orchards
alongside. The Aronow house was in a tract that had been built in the
middle of an orchard, so you kind of drove down all these orchard lanes. It
was very sweet that they invited us to stay with them, but we very rapidly
found a house that we could rent.
Herzenberg: [00:20:20] We rented a house in Menlo Park and arranged for my mother to
bring the kids out. I have some cute pictures of the kids sitting on the lawn
of the house at that time. It must have been September or October. And life
began.
When we got here, Josh had a fairly chaotic office and there was no
place for the department yet. That part of the school had not opened up. So
biochemistry was where it was, and they gave up some offices. I guess Josh

82

was in the biochemistry wing, and we were put out in a physics building that
was a kind of temporary building. It was like a two-story wooden structure
that was meant for physics offices, and they kind of created a lab out of
that.
It was just chaotic. I mean, everything was crazy. Josh, of course, had
recently won the Nobel Prize. He had all this communication that was
coming in and had no time to organize to get things done for the
department. End result, although we had sent lists of things that needed to
be ordered months before so we could set up the lab when we arrived,
nobody had written up the orders, no one had typed out the purchase
orders for this stuff, nothing was ready.
But we had cultures coming from the NIH. We had to have an
incubator, we had to have glassware and media to feed the culture. We were
floored. Len and I weren’t planning on my coming to work for Len, but I
said, “Well, I’ll write the purchase orders and get all these things together
just to help you get things started.” That’s how I got started working with
Len again.
Once everything got organized, I just continued on. Len had to hire a
technician, but I had to help train the technician to feed the animal cells.
You know, we just were doing it together, “I’ll do this, you do that,” and
just trying to get things together in this new environment and set the family
up. By that time my mother had brought the kids out.
So I wound up working for Len part-time until it became clear that I
really didn’t want to go look for a job for someone else, and he didn’t want

83

me to. We just decided to figure out how I could just work with him. So he
said, “There’s something that I really want to do and I can’t spend the time
to do it, so if you’d take that part of the project over, that would be a good
thing. You’d be working more or less on your own, but with me.
I said, “What do you want to do?”
“Well, we need to make antisera,” he answered, “and to make
antisera, you have to…” Essentially, he had gone to see George Snell, who
later got a Nobel Prize for the MHC [major histocompatibility complex].
It was Len’s idea that I should make antibodies to the MHC, which
everybody knew you could, and then we could use those antibodies to select
cells in culture. Len realized that the MHC provided natural genetic markers
normally expressed on cells. With antibodies to these markers, you could do
genetics with them, because you could select for loss mutants, you could
select for gain [gain of function mutations] mutants, you could do all these
things with a natural antigen rather something that you artificially put into,
or onto, the cells.
So Len asked me to make the antibodies that we would need in
order to do this. George Snell said that this was a good idea and he offered a
little bit of antisera, but not enough to be able to do a project. So we had to
just immunize and make our own antisera, and that led me to our next-door
neighbor over in the temporary building—Gus Nossal, who later became Sir
Gustav Nossal, world famous head of the Hall Institute in Melbourne.
There was me, “Gus, could you teach me how to immunize animals?” I can
still remember Gus sitting there and showing me how to bleed a mouse,

84

how to take out a spleen, and all the things that you need to learn to do
immunizations against animal cells. Amazingly, Gus just patiently gave me
lessons. In about a week, maybe five or six days, I came back to Gus with a
plan, and then I was off and running. I had my own project in Len’s (now
becoming our) lab.
Next, I had to set up an assay to test the antibodies to know if I’d
gotten antibodies, and so I did that. That required interacting with
somebody who was working at Bar Harbor, Jack Stimpfling, who was
working with George Snell, and he showed us. He had a new assay for
measuring these kinds of antibodies. It required using something called PVP
[polyvinylpyrrolidone]. We would use that to dilute the cells in and then
look to see if the cells agglutinated, which would mean there were
antibodies present.
Once I got the assay working, I made the antibodies Len needed so
he could do genetic selections. It all worked. Len and Howard Cann, Len’s
first fellow and later a leading human geneticist in Paris, did the selections
and published the first papers doing something like this.
Kiefer: So as you worked with Len, he didn’t need to hire an assistant. You were
more than doing the job.
Herzenberg: [00:25:56] No, no, he did hire a technician who worked with him on the
somatic cell genetics. He had cell cultures that he was growing and selecting
drug-resistance mutants, and he was doing a lot of classical what would be
bacterial genetics but doing it with the mammalian cells. So he had gotten
that started at the NIH, and he brought it forward with him here.

85

But I took this other part of the project, which was to make these
antibodies to mouse cell surface antigens. I could help Len with the cell
culture, and I did. However, he had that under control and never really
wanted me to be in that part of things. That was his thing that he was
enjoying doing, and he didn’t really need the help. Besides, he was more
interested in me opening up new areas and me doing what I wanted to do.
Making the antibodies for Len wound up opening a new project that
ultimately resulted in my first first-author paper. What happened was that,
strangely, the non-immunized pre-immunization mouse serum I was using
as a negative control turned out to show a very positive response. I then
realized that the mice I was immunizing were retired breeders and that they
had been bred to a male in a different strain, which had the antigen I was
testing for. When I tested virgin mothers, they showed cleanly negative
responses. Therefore, the outbred mothers that I got the pre-immune sera
from were becoming immunized through the pregnancy. This was then a
mouse model for Rh, which was known at the time, that the mother became
immunized through the father’s Rh antigens.
So I started working on this immunization mechanism, on how all
this was happening. That led me into working on maternal immunization,
just understanding maternal fetal and uterus and all the kinds of things that
go with that, which at the time is seemed very appropriate for a woman to
work on, which was funny. [laughs]
There was a very, very nice guy in OB/GYN named Bob Goodlin ,
and he was interested in this kind of stuff, and so I wound up working half

86

for him and half for Len, doing much my own stuff on this maternal fetal
thing. At this point, Len noticed some papers indicating that there was a
maternal fetal immunoglobulin story going on in immunization, and he
suggested I look into that. It was an immune suppression story that he’d
noticed. He picked it up in a paper, and said, “Here, did you look at this?”
I said, “Oh, I don’t know,” although ultimately it became something
that I really got interested in.
I stayed working with Len, and we worked very closely together. Mel
Cohn left Stanford after a couple of years, and Len took in one of Mel’s
students, a wonderful guy named John Wunderlich, to do a different kind of
immunogenetics project. I started watching what they were doing. They
were making antibodies to an immunoglobulin molecule, and I started
working on that.
I had very good eyes at that time, and we had these little agar plates,
in which you could see little lines where antibodies and antigens met up. I
recognized that in several animals, immunization was stimulating antibody
production to antigens on two distinct immunoblobulins, not just one. Two
different proteins were being recognized. And from that came the
recognition that the genes that encoded these kinds of immunoglobulins
were very closely linked on a chromosome, and this became the
immunoglobulin chromosome that I’m still working on. [laughs]
Kiefer: Wonderful.
Herzenberg: [00:29:51] It’s kind of fun, but, yes, it’s turned out to be a very interesting—
we more or less predicted what it turned out to be, but, of course, it’s much

87

more interesting now than it was back then. And I’m still working on it, as I
say.
Kiefer: As your lab developed, you had graduate students, post grads? What was
your student component?
Herzenberg: [00:30:16] Let’s see. Well, we were able to move from the temporary
building a few months after we set up the laboratory. That temporary
building was a disaster. When it got up to 110 degrees outside, which it did
one day, the cultures were in an incubator that was supposed to be
maintained at 98.6—37 degrees—so we were putting ice in the incubator to
keep the cultures down to temperature. It was not possible to work there.
So they got us over into the main building as rapidly as possible, and with
that came all sorts of colleagues, and the whole environment changed.
We moved in. Gus moved over with us, and so Gus and Olli Makela
were in the lab next door. Josh kept inviting immunologists to work in the
department and introduce several other people interested in immunology.
One of them he put downstairs near us, a guy named Avrion Mitchison—
these were the top names in immunology at that time, and we were all there.
George Klein was here, Av Mitchison, Gus, and all these made up a
new view. It was more of a genetic view, because we knew Gus proved that
one cell makes one antibody. But we still didn’t know how that cell was
stimulated or how it made the antibodies. Josh’s concept was that
immunization selected for those cells that made the right antibody, one that
reacted with the immunizing antigen. That’s true. He was right about that,
and that was his basic tenet. Josh didn’t mind what the details would be; that

88

was the concept of how it was working. We didn’t know about T-cells at
that time. We only knew about B-cells.
We were all living in this basement corridor, and the animal facility
was put across the hall from us and I ran the animal facility. We had an
animal caretaker, but by that time I learned all about breeding mice. We
bred new strains of mice and did all kinds of things. So I became the chief
animal caretaker. I was in charge of that.
We had Gus’ mice in there and we had our mice in there, and Av
kept his mice—Av was so funny. [laughs] He liked to grow his mice in
battery jars rather than cages. They were these round jars. It was his belief
that the mice were happiest when they were piled way up on top of one
another. He’s probably correct. He said, “This is how they live in the wild.
They’re really happy to get a hundred mice into a small space. They keep
each other warm, they feed each other, and this is how they’re happiest.”
But our veterinarians have different ideas of this. They are really
wrong. The way that animals are kept right now is not conducive to learning
what we need to learn from the animals. It’s conducive to doing surgery in
the animals if you don’t want them to get infected, but if you really want to
learn about the immune system, you can’t put them in a single cage by
themselves. You learn something, for sure, but it’s not what you should be
learning. But anyway, that’s another whole area of how the world has
evolved. I mean, we learn other things much better because we do this. It’s
not as if everything is downhill, but there are things that are missing.

89

Anyway, Av he did keep them in there, but he had an incubator he
worked in. We had to bleed mice. To take blood from them, you take it
from the tail and you nick the tail. You want the mouse to be warm, because
when he’s cold, his tail constricts, so you don’t get that much bleeding. So
you usually put them in a warm environment, usually an incubator that’s,
say, at like an 85-degree or 90-degree room, and you nick the tail. The thing
about this was that Av would bleed his mice. When you’d come in there, he
had the incubator open where he was bleeding the mice, so the mice were
crawling all over Av and up his arm. [laughs] They’re lovely. Mice are very
nice. Captive mice are quite lovely pets, and Av just loved them. He’d put
them all in the jar, but then he didn’t put the lid on, so the mice would jump
out. [laughs] It was very funny. But we kept ours in the animal room
because we had cultures going in the room, and you can’t get the cultures
dirty with the mice.
Kiefer: Did you have some doctoral students and postdocs working with you?
Herzenberg: [00:35:19] At that time, Howard Cann met us before we came to came here.
He met us in Washington and came and asked if he could be a postdoc in
Len’s lab. He later went from our lab into pediatrics, then was here for a
long time, and ultimately moved to France and ran the France Genome
Center, Dausset’s—Dausset was the Nobel Prize in France, and Howard
was the person who ran the center under Dausset. So he was medical.
Then we had a postdoc who was a classic postdoc, this funny guy, a
little bit strange. [laughs] He was so funny. Somebody spilled a cup of
coffee, and Ben came into the lab as we were wiping it up. He said, “You

90

didn’t have to do that. I would have done it for you,” because he was always
spilling his coffee all over the place. [laughs]
There were three students, three medical students. This was the first
year of the medical school down here and the second year. The first year
was the student that Mel Cohn passed over to us. He was in the very first
year. His name was John Wunderlich, and he’s now at the NIH. John came
in, and he’s the one who started doing the immunoglobulin genetics. We
had Harvey Ozer and Robert Erickson, who were both second year. They
entered in the second year of the medical school, and both of them went on
to be professors one place or another. They shared a cadaver, I believe, with
Irv Weissman and Herb Kaiser. Irv is now the head of the Stanford Stem
Cell Center. He was in the lab for a while, but he wanted to work on some
stuff that Len didn’t want to work on, and so he moved to Henry Kaplan’s
lab, where they had funding to do that kind of project.
There were four medical students in that group, two actually were
working in the lab, but were all part of the group. Then Halsted Holman
was the head of medicine, and he had two medical fellows. They hung out at
the lab—Bob Mishell and Henry Wortis—and they were very much driving
forces. So there was this whole gang of people.
There were no women at that time. Helen, Olli’s wife, worked with
Josh. She was a bacterial geneticist, and they were quite close friends. They
moved over to Menlo Park, where we were living. They took the house
across the street, and we had a great thing going. The grownups, us and Olli
and Helen, would hang out at our house. Our cousin, a younger guy who

91

was living with us, and their babysitter got on quite well together. So they
stayed at the other house. We’d send the kids over there to play and we’d do
what we’d do. [laughs] It was really funny, but it was a nice little commune.
It was just essentially a house that stret ceterahed across the street.
Kiefer: So you were really the only woman there in the lab?
Herzenberg: [00:38:49] In our labs there was a woman who was a technician—Joyce —
but there were no women scientists at that time.
Kiefer: Was there any difference in attitude towards you versus towards others, or
did they accept you because of Len?
Herzenberg: [00:39:11] Well, remember that I had no bachelor’s degree, I had nothing, so
I didn’t have a right to standing. I had to earn my right to standing. We had
a regular seminar that met every Tuesday night, and at that seminar I spoke
up when I had something to say, which was not infrequently. I was doing all
the reading that everyone else was doing, and I “put my two cents in”
whenever I had two cents. At one point, Len worried about this a little bit.
He asked Av, “Do you mind if Lee is doing this?” Because he didn’t want
other people to feel that he was imposing me on them.
Av said, “No, no, no. Just let her say what she wants to. She’s very
bright and she says interesting things. Don’t stop her. She’s contributing.” It
was a very clear message, and Len was quite happy with that message. So
from that time on, I was as much a part of that group as anyone.
So now I’m in a group in a way that was something like how I was
with my father’s Boy Scout troop, where I’m the only woman talking up in
this group, but it doesn’t matter to me because I know all the people and

92

they all love me. And even if they didn’t, the structure of the group was set
up so that it was OK for me to be there as well as everyone else.
That was a major thing. As I said, Len did feel constrained at the time
to ask Av about my presence. Av was more senior by a few years. Gus and
Olli were the same age as we were. But they all treated me as welcome. As a
scientist, I was junior to them, and I recognized that, but that didn’t mean
that I couldn’t ask graduate student kind of questions. So that was kind of
like my graduate years, if you like, those first few years, and my professors
were Av and Olli and Gus and Len. We had very, very incredibly interactive
discussions about papers, taking the papers apart, what’s wrong with them,
what’s right with them, what’s been found, what do we accept, et cetera..
Let’s move for a minute to the overall department structure, and how
I was accepted there. Josh’s wife had been his collaborator in the bacterial
genetics studies for which he won the Nobel Prize. She was, depending on
one’s point of view, the person who taught Josh everything he knew about
bacterial genetics, or a royal pain in the butt. [laughs] I mean, she was a very
difficult woman, perhaps not unreasonably, because she was not appreciated
and wanted at least part of the appreciation Josh got. But nobody was
Josh’s equivalent. No one in this world was ever Josh’s equivalent. I think
that that was very frustrating to her. I think it was a complicated marriage
and it eventually broke up. Esther was just this very difficult person that we
all had difficulty with. It wasn’t that she was nasty or anything—she would
talk interminably about stuff, often not to the point that you were interested
in. That’s my recollection of her.

93

I could never get close to her. She was not somebody who would say,
“Here’s another woman. I’ll—.” You know. Not even to be helpful to her,
but she just wasn’t that kind of person. This was fine with me, because my
way of being was I don’t care if you’re a man or a woman, but I’m used to
being with the men and I don’t make a big difference out of it. But there
weren’t that many women around. It was not just me. I mean, everybody
had difficulty with her.
There was another woman who was a graduate student, Ann
Ganesan, who was upstairs in Josh’s unit. She was working on something
very far away from my interest. I knew a lot about bacterial genetics, but
somehow we didn’t get together intellectually with her and the guy, a
graduate student, who became her husband. We were good friends, we did
social things together, but scientifically we didn’t have a connection. They
were interested in bacterial genetics, and I had done bacterial genetics, but it
wasn’t what I was really interested in. I was working on all these crazy
mammalian things at that time.
Eva and George Klein came, and I did really relate quite well to Eva,
but they weren’t there that long. They’re famous Swedish immunologists.
Some complicated things happened and they left early, which I was quite
sad about it.
Throughout life, I was always good friends with Eva. Once I gave a
talk at a meeting, and she turned up and gave me a lovely necklace, she said
“because the talk was so good”. A very feminine thing to do, and one with a
great deal of meaning.

94

Eva was, in her own right, a very famous scientist, and she and
George were good partners. They were, in a certain sense, a kind of model
that Len and I knew you could be like this, and so that was great. We were
quite close, actually, through them, with the Swedish group. There were
several other people in that Swedish group. We went to Sweden. They came
to Palo Alto.
I think those were the women in my early world. Eva was clearly a
model, as was Esther Lederberg. I mean, these are women who held their
own in a science intellectual world, so I wasn’t alone. But in the area that I
was working, I was the only woman, but it didn’t matter. It wasn’t a big deal.
Kiefer: Now, didn’t your work evolve to or become involved with—FACS, I think
are the initials for it?
Len is the inventor of the FACS, the Fluorescence-Activated Cell
Sorter, and his invention was not the instrumentation that made it work. In
fact, someone else built a part of that machine before he ever got to it, and
they gave him the plans for that, and that’s very well known. But the reason
that he’s the inventor of the FACS is that he recognized that you needed to
put fluorescence detection on this and you needed to put size detection on
it in order to make the machine usable. Those are the things that make what
the FACS is the FACS, as opposed to some of the counters and other kinds
of machines that were around at the time.
I worked closely with him on this. He guided the building of the
FACS, he was in there with the engineers. What happened was that Av’s lab
was then cleaned out and was replaced. Lederberg now got interested in

95

exobiology. He’d finished with immunology, and he now got interested in
exobiology and was involved in the first Mars shot. So he set up an
exobiology laboratory in which he had a bunch of engineers, and they were
physically right next door to us, and so we all played ping-pong together and
we hung out together.
Josh had some other computer science people upstairs, who started
coming downstairs and commandeered part of the ping-pong room. The
ping-pong room that we used was renovated and now part of the current
library. At the time, it was just an empty space waiting to become library. It
was just a room with pillars and cement floor, a low ceiling and a couple of
windows. It was just across the hall from our corridor, so we
commandeered it and said, “OK, this will be our room to have lunch in and
play ping-pong in.” We just used it as a recreation room, basically.
When Lederberg saw that, he put the computer group into a corner
of that space. Once the computer group was in there, they joined our ping
pong and lunch group and became close friends. So I learned to program,
basically because I could learn and my friends were willing to teach me.
I learned to program on what I think is the earliest minicomputer,
which Josh got from the MIT Lincoln Labs. If you say this and move your
fingers like this, the people who did programming in the old days know
what you mean. It’s when you’re moving your fingers, the two fingers
together, you’re hitting the switches because there are ones and zeros. Up is
one, and zero is down, and you get a bank of sixteen of those, and you set
those into a certain pattern, and that’s an instruction. Then you push the

96

button and then you set them into another pattern, you push the button.
That’s how you program the computer. You programmed it by visually
setting the lights that meant that those were the addresses that you were
moving to and those were the commands. You can say “jump to” or do
things. It was a whole—I mean, understanding a computer at that level
was—that was called—it was the Lincoln Labs was the first mini computer.
It became Digital Equipment Corporation eventually.
I learned programming at that time when you could do this when
there wasn’t even memory on the computer. You had tape. That was all the
memory. [laughs] It was amazing what was not on that little computer. But
nonetheless, there were engineers who were working it, and they were
willing to teach me if I was willing to learn. My love of computers stems
from that. Then they said I should go take the computer programming class,
which was for the bigger computer. It was before Pascal. I went and took a
real course in computer programming and learned how to make the big
computer say hello or something like that.
At that time I had actually a woman friend, Henry Wortis’ wife.
Henry was one of the people who were working in our lab. His formal lab
was in medicine. He was a medical fellow, but his wife was doing
psychology, and she and I would talk a lot. She was monitoring birds
feeding, mothers feeding babies, and you had to keep pushing a button
every time the mother did this, and you pushed a different time when the
mother did that, when the baby did this, you did that, and she wound up

97

with these things, and she’d sit there and score them. And I said, “Why
don’t you use the computer for that?”
And she said, “Oh, that’s an interesting thing to do.”
Herzenberg: [00:50:38] As far as I understand, when Shelley went back and did her
dissertation, everybody at Rutgers was excited about this, because they had
not seen computers used to do this kind of thing, and this was very
innovative.
Kiefer: About the bird-feeding study.
Herzenberg: [00:50:52] Yes, yes, essentially. It was something that normally you wouldn’t
even think about doing without a computer now, I mean, but at that time
she did it all by hand on paper tapes. So there were all sorts of things. It was
a very exciting—and her husband, Henry, was doing beautiful science.
Kiefer: And Henry’s last name was?
Herzenberg: [00:51:09] Wortis. He’s a funny guy. His high school girlfriend was Mary
Travers, from Peter, Paul, and Mary.
Kiefer: Really?
Herzenberg: [00:51:22] So he had introduced me to Mary. She and I have maintained a
very distant but nonetheless—when we’d see each other, I’d come back
stage every so often. She’d say, “Oh, how are you? And how’s Henry and
how’s everything?”
Kiefer: Oh, that’s wonderful.
Herzenberg: [00:51:36] She was very sweet. She was a lovely woman, absolutely lovely
woman.
Kiefer: She’s passed away, right?

98

Herzenberg: [00:51:41] She has, yes.
Kiefer: It sounds like there was a lot of interaction not just with geneticists, but with
engineers and computer people.
Herzenberg: [00:51:52] Exactly, but this was Josh, OK. This was Josh’s department. He
would bring these people in, and it was a small department, so we would get
to know them if we wanted to. They were right next door at the lab sitting
next to us. This is the value of mixing up departments. The mistake we have
is that we make all these departments contiguous. It’s useful from an
administrative point of view and you can draw the map, but the value of
that cross-feeding was really important.
But Josh then went from the Mars shot and that technology, he went
to computer technology, and he then had there in his group a guy named
Tom Rindfleisch, who ultimately became head of the Stanford Libraries. I
wrote a history of Josh and computing, as we remembered it, Tom and I, of
the department and the kind of ferments that were there.
One of the guys who was in that department at the time was Larry
Tesler, and I guess somebody needs to debrief Larry about the history back
there. It really is important. Larry is the person who told Steve Jobs how to
do windowing.
Kiefer: Really?
Herzenberg: [00:53:11] There’s a great New Yorker article about Steve Jobs, and there’s
this whole section in there about how Larry told him about doing
windowing. Well, standing behind Larry as he was telling Jobs, figuratively
but maybe literally, was the guy who’s worked for us all these years, a guy

99

named Wayne Moore, who then came back and put up windowing for us as
the first. The first windowing I ever saw was on our computer. I’ll come to
Wayne. I mean, I’m jumping way ahead, and I shouldn’t, but those are the
roots that Josh planted this engineering group next to us. I was as
interested—my father was an electrician; my brother was interested, he was
a psychologist and headed up a Department of Psychology, but it was the
first computing department. He was always interested in computing, and my
brother and I always, always talked a lot and were always good friends.
Kiefer: So back to the FACS. I understand there’s a patent connected with that.
Was it connected with hybridoma technology?
Herzenberg: [00:54:45] That’s more than ten years’ hence. So the FACS begins with
Josh’s lab next door and with Henry Kaplan. Len’s idea was to be able to
sort cells because there was no way of studying them and doing genetics
with them unless you could isolate a cell that was by itself. His idea of
making these antibodies to cell surface antigens—that all came into the fact
that we wanted to be able to identify which cells expressed those genetic
markers and then do genetics with them.
Len saw the FACS as a way of sorting cells to be able to do somatic
cell genetics and also to characterize the cells in lymphoid organs, because
by this time I’d gotten involved in immunology. Nothing that I was
involved in was he not involved in, and nothing that he was involved in was
I not involved in.
So Len eventually got together with Kaplan, with Lederberg’s
blessing, and Kaplan put up 15k and Len had 15k, and they said, “OK,

100

we’re going to build a FACS.” And the joke is, OK, a million-five later, they
had an instrument. But they did build the prototype.
I was always like a cheerleader in this thing, and very much Len’s
consultant about what the machine should do to be useful. But I was never
involved in the engineering meetings. Len had the engineering meetings
himself with people, but he would come back and talk to me about it, and
then we would discuss what could be done with the engineering meeting. So
I was part of it but not involved in the direct engineering meetings. This
probably wasn’t because I was a woman, or not mainly because of that. It’s
just that I was busy being a biologist and running my side of the lab. For
Len to be able to do all the engineering meetings that he spent time in, he
needed me to keep all the physical stuff in the lab going.
The other thing is that Len was not an engineer at all, so when he
went to those engineering meetings, he’d come home and talk to me, and if
it was mathematic stuff, he would often bring it back to me, because
between us, I was the one who did basically arithmetic. It was mathematics,
but it was mathematics at a very, very simple level. I never became a
mathematician as people would call a real mathematician, nor a real engineer
as engineering did, but in terms of understanding the thrust of what was
there, that’s what we had.
Then eventually we moved the lab upstairs. The department got
bigger. They added the big mainframe that Josh put in that was right next to
the department. It kind of lived in the breezeway between the two buildings
once that building was built. I was always involved. I was helping to

101

troubleshoot that and debug it because I just liked the stuff. It was
something that my father and brother taught me to do and it was my thing.
Len never had anything to do with computer programming. He never
wanted anything to do with it. [laughs] But he didn’t mind my doing it. He
liked me doing it except when it got in the way of him wanting—why isn’t
something else done that needed to get done? [laughs] But computer
programming was the ultimate crossword puzzle, so you just tend to love it
if you love that kind of stuff. Anyway, that’s pretty well what the
environment was like downstairs.
We all lived over in Menlo Park near Perry Lane. Walter Bodmer
came. After Gus left, Walter took over Gus’ house, and he came with Julia.
Julia at that time was not really speaking up very much. She was more of an
Englishwoman, and she really didn’t speak up much as a scientist, but she
probably was a good scientist at that time. I didn’t realize how much so. She
was definitely contributory intellect, a good one, but it was in areas of
population genetics, which is stuff that was not my interest, again.
Kiefer: I understand there was a patent involved that was and still is one of the
most lucrative patents that Stanford has.
Herzenberg: [00:59:30] Well, actually several patents came through, and I can’t
remember. I guess I should ask and become enlightened on this. I don’t
really remember.
We moved upstairs. Len was moving a prototype of this cell sorter,
which by this time had gotten to be a functional prototype, and we were
beginning to actually look at cells through it when a guy who was a high-

102

level manager, engineering manager from Becton, Dickinson came by with
his nephew. Couldn’t have been his nephew, but anyway, some guy who was
like his nephew. He came because he was asking—should the company
make antibodies to things that could be looked at? Mainly we were using
antibodies to kill cells at that time. It was called complement dependent
killing.
Bernie came by asking something about making antibodies and how
would they make antibodies, and this guy was interested in how you would
make antibodies. He’d heard that Len knew immunology and knew about
antibodies, which actually was my thing, not so much Len’s.
So Len called me into the office with them. But then Len turned
around and said, “Well, you know, if you really want to make a difference
and you really want to make a lot of money and build a company, the thing
you should do is build a commercial version of this cell sorter that I’m
building.”
Bernie was a very smart guy, and he listened. So he said, “Oh, tell me
about it,” and Len told him what he was doing. Bernie understood that this
was a good thing to do. Bernie was also the kind of businessman who never
invested money if he could help it. He was wonderfully tightfisted. It was
good.
This was a little before Nixon’s War on Cancer got going, and Len
was asked to sit on a committee that would review grant applications for the
War on Cancer. Len turned around and he said, “No, I don’t want to do
that, because I want to apply to that committee for funds.” And he did. He

103

applied for funds to build two cell sorters, which he said would do for
cancer more than anything else they could think of. Len was absolutely
right. It was an incredible vision, because you would not know how to treat
cancer if it was not for the FACS.
OK. That’s what the FACS does. When you hear “stem cells,” when
you hear “leukemia treatments,” when you hear “HIV,” where you hear any
of these things, these are medical uses of the FACS, and without them, we
would not even recognize that HIV resulted in loss of T-cells [laughs]
There was not a patent on the original FACS machine. That I know.
But I’ve heard that there was some patent that was issued for some silly part
of the FACS machine, and Becton Dickinson licensed that patent. It was
kind of a corner part, not important. I don’t really know. There was a patent
at that time, but more important was that Stanford actually kind of licensed
the FACS machine to Becton, Dickinson.
Now, this was prior to what’s called the Cohen-Boyer patent, and the
Cohen-Boyer patent was the beginning of licensing biotech, really. Before
that, it was not a big business. Cohen-Boyer was the first molecular biology
patent. But the FACS was already lucrative to Stanford before it was very
much of a patent position, because Bernie understood he should be
supporting Stanford in the development of this project. As much as he was
tightfisted, he was smart, and so he did provide support when it was needed.
That history is in the Office of Technology Licensing and ought to
be written out somewhere. I don’t think it has been. It was pretty loose,
because until the patent lawyers got into this, it was a much more personal

104

arrangement between Niels Reimers, who was the head of the office, and
Bernie. And I don’t even know that Len knew what all the arrangements
were. What we knew was that we were building the instrument
collaboratively for this grant that we had. And then Bernie asked Len to
travel around with him and to explain to people what the instrument did,
and he did that, and that created the groundwork for this whole instrument
and the market it serves.
The FACS instrument then grew, and more and more of them turned
up. Becton, Dickinson built individuals, so it was kind of a custom industry
in a way, until—this would be 1976 when we went on sabbatical to César
Milstein’s science lab. César Milstein was the person who got the Nobel
Prize for inventing monoclonal antibodies.
Kiefer: What years were those?
Herzenberg: [01:06:12] 1976 and ‘77, I think.
Kiefer: And his lab was where?
Herzenberg: [01:06:19] In Cambridge. Now, that’s an interesting women’s story. By this
time, I’m well established. I have students, I’m well respected in our lab, and
I’m publishing my own papers. Len and I run the lab together, and I’m
accustomed to doing science and giving talks at meetings and doing the rest
of this.
Len, during this time leading up to the sabbatical—this is early
1970s—chaired maybe a third to a half of all the immunology meetings that
were held. It was a small field, and he was either chair or on the committee.
He had by that time two fellows, Elizabeth Simpson and Patricia Jones.

105

Patricia’s a Professor here and has done important work in the provost’s
office. She’s been here almost all her professional life. She’s been away, but
she’s basically been here. Len’s statement was very simply that if he spends
the time on a postdoctoral student in his laboratory, he doesn’t expect her
to have less opportunity than him, and therefore he was either not going to
train any women or he was going to see to it that the women got good
places on symposia and had adequate careers equal to the careers they could
have had as men, and pretty much he did this. He made sure that the
positions were open for women to speak on these programs.
There were not very many women, but there was me, there was Pat,
there was Liz. There was Marian Koshland who was married to the guy who
eventually became editor of Science. She was a Berkeley professor and very
strong in her own right. There may have been one or two other women who
were that advanced, and then there were younger women who were coming
up. Linda whatever her name is—she just got an award from San Diego—
and some of the Swedish women, Erna Mueller, Eva Klein, et cetera. There
were enough women that we could have women on all the programs, and
Len just saw to it that we did. He said, “I don’t want to hear that there’s a
man who can do that job better than Erna can. There isn’t. And Erna is very
capable of giving this talk.”
So he built a space for women in immunology, so much so that when
one year when we arrived for a meeting at Asilomar, and the microbiology
meetings had been held just before us and were leaving our meeting was

106

coming in, this guy came out and said, “How come you guys have all these
women at these meetings? We don’t have any women like that.” [laughs]
Kiefer: Wonderful.
Herzenberg: [01:09:31] So, yes, Len did this. Liz (Elizabeth Simpson?) became inheritor
to Peter Medawar in England. She is the grand dame of immunology in
England, and there were a couple of other women there. And Av was a very
strong supporter—Av Mitchison, the guy we mentioned earlier at Stanford,
was back in England. He was a very strong supporter of women in his lab.
So if the women got there, they found places. It was hard. Women didn’t
know that they could come to these labs and have positions and would be
respected.
So I got to running much of the lab at Stanford. I decided what was
going to happen with this or with that, and I was just used to doing this. If I
said something was going to be this way, if Len wanted to argue with me, he
would --- and did, and we came to agreement. Mostly I didn’t feel I had to
ask him permission for anything and he didn’t have to ask me for
permission for anything. We were just running the lab together.
We get to England and César Milstein said, well, there wouldn’t be
place for me at Mill Hill, but he would make room for me at a different lab
about 20 minutes away [ARC Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham,
Cambridge ], outside Mill Hill. It was a farm lab, basically. That’s where they
did the work on big animals. And he organized for me to be there. He said
his wife was at that place and that I could have a lab of my own there.

107

Well, it turned out, the difference was whether you were at Mill Hill,
which was where real science was being done, or at that place. There was
one real scientist there whom I really still adore, but otherwise there was no
real science at Babraham. The guy Cesar sent me to work with was actually a
fairly brilliant guy named Arnold Feinstein, but had no use for women. He
was—excuse the expression—a pig. I mean his clothing was always hanging
out—really a slob, and pretty crazy in a lot of ways.
One of the technicians who worked for him told me “if I can do
something to sabotage Arnold’s work, I will”. I thought, “Oh, that’s great.
I’m really good to be in this lab.” Here I am, working with the forefront
people in immunology about how to measure responses and do all this. I’m
the measurement freak. Remember I’m the mathematician, so called, the
numbers lady, that none of them are. And then here’s Arnold coming and
telling me to set up this very stupid non-quantitative experiment with sheep
cells, which we never used. I said, “This is just not going to work.”
So after about two or three months of going out there—actually, I
liked going there. It was a very nice place to go to work. There were sheep
in the pasture and there was a sheepdog that used to work the sheep. My
desk faced right out onto this beautiful pasture. The building was always icy
cold, but if you put enough sweaters on, you could sit and watch the
sheepdog work the sheep. It was totally lovely to watch.
But I was getting nothing done out there, and I finally just settled
down to a different kind of work. My daughter came to live with us and
offered to be my secretary. I just agreed to write chapters for The Handbook

108

of Experimental Immunology, for which I became the editor-in-chief some years
later, after we went through several volumes. But it started out there. I was
just writing. These were methodology articles. I wrote some for the first
volume and some for the second volume. My role grew. I finally did the
final set of volumes as lead editor. They were wonderful. I would like to go
back and do another set of volumes if I could. These days I could do this
without much more easily. With online publication, that you can do almost
anything.
But anyway, César plunked me out in that place, and Len went to
work at Mill Hill. There were strange things in César’s lab. César had just
discovered how to make what we ultimately called hybridomas. Now,
hybridomas are antibodies where you take a tumor that is a tumor growing
in culture forever, and you basically mash that together with normal
antibody-producing cells in such a way that the tumor now produces the
antibody that came from one of the normal cells that you mashed together.
Then you clone these out and you have clones, each producing a single type
of antibody. Each clone got the genes that define the structure of the
antibody it makes from a normal antibody producing cell. The tumor
donated its tumor apparatus, which enabled the clone to grow indefinitely
and produce infinite amounts of one antibody.
In your antibody-producing cells, the important discovery of Nossal
and Lederberg that starts this whole chain going was that each antibodyproducing cell produces one and only one antibody molecule. By that we
mean the structure, the sequence of that antibody molecule is defined by the

109

genetics. A protein is made because you have a gene that encodes the
protein, and the gene gets translated and eventually becomes the protein.
So the advance that César made was to “hybridize” antibody
producing cells with tumor cells, to get cells that grow infinitely and produce
only a single type of antibody. Len, with his graduate student at Stanford,
had actually done this before Cesar. The joke is that the guy who did it often
says, “I left my Nobel Prize in my desk,” because he did the experiment but
wouldn’t calculate the data. He [Roy Riblet] finally admitted to me a few
weeks ago, he admitted to me he had actually calculated enough of the data
to know the experiment was successful, but he wanted to do something else
and he didn’t think this was important enough to allow Len that much
direction of his life. He liked Len. He just wouldn’t twist himself over to
that. He’s a funny guy, and he’s always been that way. He’s brilliant,
absolutely brilliant.
Kiefer: And this is who?
Herzenberg: [01:16:34] Roy Riblet, his name is. He still works with me. We’re back doing
some very interesting stuff again on genetics and antibodies.
But in any event, Roy had done this before we left for sabbatical.
César had announced that he’d done it. He’d published it. Roy figured,
“Well, then, OK, he published it. I don’t have to publish mine. This is
second best now.” But he had had it first. He knew he did. It was their
Nobel Prize if Len had published it. But Len wasn’t concerned with that. He
knew what these antibodies could be used for and wanted to get on with it.
César was more interested in using the antibodies as a means of studying

110

antibody genetics, which was very interesting. And antibody structure. Cesar
was an antibody structure man, and so he really wanted it for that purpose,
whereas Len had other purposes for it.
Len got to the MRC [Laboratory of Molecular Biology] in Cambridge
and started working with Cesar. There was a discussion that Len and I had.
I guess it must have been very important because I still remember where we
were sitting. Len said, “You know, these antibodies could be used as FACS
reagents.” Because our problem by this time was there were maybe ten
FACS machines out, and we had a meeting of the people who had the
FACS machines in Cambridge. The big thing at the meeting was, “I see this
with the antiserum I made and you see something different with the
antiserum that you made. We can’t really compare to figure out which of us
is right. The fact is that the antisera are different, and we don’t know
whether it’s the antisera, the technique, or the FACS measurements that are
different.
Basically, the FACS was less useful because we couldn’t get reagents
that would reliably identify cells. To identify them, you have to make the cell
fluorescent, and so you need an antibody that you can put a fluorescent
marker on. You could only get a certain amount of that out of an animal, so
the reagent was priceless, because you could never reproduce it in quite the
same way. All antibodies are different and what we had in antisera was a
mixture of antibodies. So you would label it with the fluorescence. You
would then take the fluorescent that you labeled and put it on cells and then

111

wash off what didn’t belong there, and now you could see here this cell was
getting fluorescent.
But you couldn’t pass enough of that antisera around to ten people
so they could all reproduce what you were doing. So it wasn’t science. It was
very frustrating for Len, who was purely a scientist who said it’s got to be
reproducible. You have to understand that you’ve got to be able to do it. We
were lost without this ability to really understand, to really define the
reagents, to have reagents that I could give to you, that you could take home
to your lab and use, so that when you studied an animal that was the same
kind of animal as mine, you should see the same things. The FACS should
show you this, but the clean reagents were missing.
Without such reagents, FACS was languishing. So Len said that now
we can make these antibodies, these hybrid antibodies—the animal made
the antibody for you, so you could take an animal that was making an
antiserum, you could take its cells, and now you could use those cells to mix
them with the tumor that could make them immortal, that could
immortalize them, and you could isolate them and you could clone each
one, and you could then test all the different possible antibodies that you
made and find the antibody that was good or find the antibodies that were
good, and find different ones because the animal made all these different
things.
So it essentially immortalized individual antibody-producing cells by
doing this, and Len and I said we could use these as FACS reagents. Now,
this had not actually occurred to César, as far as we know. Whether it had or

112

not, it didn’t matter. Len understood that this was something that had to be
gotten out and had to be used as a source of FACS reagents, because this
was what we needed. César got his Nobel Prize and he got the credit for
making the hybridomas. But it was actually Len (and I) who knew what to
do with them, and that was really more important. César actually was doing
interesting science about immunoglobulin molecules, but he wasn’t
interested in this. He claimed afterwards that that’s why he had done this.
Maybe it was why. It’s between him and his maker. I don’t know what the
story was. But he definitely was not talking to us about this when we got to
Cambridge.
Len had agreed to chair a “ski” meeting with Eli Sercarz during the
coming winter. He and I talked about this, realizing that he was in a position
to introduce monoclonal antibodies as tools for FACS. He talked to Eli and
the decided to add a session and ask César to come and speak about
monoclonal antibodies, which Len said was the salvation for immunology
and immunologists should know about this as soon as possible. We were
running one of these ski meetings, Park City, maybe, and he set it up and
got César come speak. We really wanted to get people to understand that
monoclonal antibodies could be used as FACS reagents or in other assays to
really identify cell types. But for Len, the meeting was to introduce
monoclonals as FACS reagents, and he was very, very excited about it. The
monoclonal producing cells became known as hybridomas, and I was the
person who named them. [laughs] It’s just very funny.
Kiefer: Wow.

113

Herzenberg: [01:22:50] We were having a Christmas party at the Cambridge Club. César
invited us to his club for this party, Christmas or New Year’s, I forget
which, but a holiday party. We were all sitting at the table and I said, “César,
this is ridiculous. We have no way of talking about these cells. We say they
are hybrid antibodies. We call them tumor antibodies. We call them cloned
antibodies. Very confusing. We need a single name. It’s going to be New
Year’s very soon. We need to name it now.”
So he said, “Well, what—?”
Nobody came up with anything else. I said “Hybridoma.”
They said, “Yes, that’s good. That’s a good name.” So that’s how they
came to be named hybridomas, to imply that they are hybrids between
normal antibody producing cells and a myeloma cell line capable of
producing and secreting unlimited amounts of a single antibody l.
Kiefer:

So the patent resulted from that.

Herzenberg: No, no, it didn’t. There wasn’t a patent on hybridomas because neither we
nor Bernie Shoor (leader of the FACS effort at Becton Dickinson) believed
patents should be allowed on biological products. Len finally convinced
Bernie monoclonals would be a viable product for BD. It took eighteen
months to get from the time Len proposed that BD build a Monoclonal
Center till they finally got it moving. At my suggestion, they took one of my
B cell fellows (Chuck Metzler) to become the head of the Monoclonal
Center and build it. I actually had a lot to do with building that initial
Monoclonal Center because Chuck would often come to me with questions
and stuff.

114

Anyway, we didn’t patent it. Bernie didn’t feel it should be patented.
It was a biological material, and we thought it was wrong to patent it. That
cost Becton, Dickinson $5 million because other people patented stuff that
we could have patented, but they patented it and we wouldn’t. We thought
it was wrong.
Bert Roland, the lawyer who did the Cohen-Boyer patent, argued
with me about this. He argued strongly that patenting should be done, and I
argued just as strongly, saying, “Really, we don’t want to do this.” And
Bernie didn’t want to patent either. He was a very moral guy. We just felt it
was immoral to be patenting this biological stuff, and it is, because it
resulted in the reagents often being lower quality. The patented one was the
one that won. Even if somebody had a better one, they couldn’t sell it
because the guy who patented the first one was the one everyone has to use.
It was very badly patented (from the standpoint of science and medicine). It
shouldn’t have been patented that way. It could have been patented to apply
only to a single monoclonal antibody based on its structure, or to all
monoclonal antibodies that recognize the protein structure that the original
antibody recognized. Instead, the patent was granted broadly to cover any
monoclonal antibody that recognized any structure on the whole biological
molecule that had the structure the original antibody recognized.
It didn’t do the field any good to have this broad control over all
monoclonal antibodies produced to a single biological molecule; it didn’t do
medicine any good; but it did make a lot of money for the person and
company that patented the original antibody. It cost Becton Dickinson a lot,

115

because they had to pay royalties for antibodies that got covered by the
patent. But because Becton, -Dickinson had built the first as the
Monoclonal Center for FACS reagents, in the end, they were OK. Bernie
said people would pay for it without the patent, and they ran for several
years before the patent kicked in. They did pay lots of patent royalties, so
ultimately Becton Dickinson and we started patenting our antibodies. We
did so because it became the rules, basically. But we really did not, and I still
do not, approve of monoclonal antibodies being broadly patented. I think
there’s a very good argument against it. It is not in the public interest,
because someone can make a better antibody, or biological, but still have to
pay royalties. Because of this, companies are not interested, even if the
antibody is really better. The economics are against it.
The patent we have that has made all the money for Stanford was a
different thing. Len foresaw that antibodies would be good for therapy. He
tried to get Becton, Dickinson to understand that, and Becton, Dickinson
did not really. He was head of their advisory committee at that time. But
they didn’t want to get into medical stuff, having to deal with the FDA, and
also they didn’t really think monoclonal antibodies would be much in terms
of therapy.
At the same time, there were problems with this because if you use a
mouse antibody into a human, the human becomes immunized to the
mouse protein and then the antibody doesn’t work anymore. So what was
necessary was to humanize the antibody, and that’s what the patent is for.
It’s a way of taking the mouse “business end” of the antibody molecule, the

116

thing that recognized what you wanted the antibody to bind to, and tying it
to a human “nonbusiness” end, so that you would have a functional like an
antibody molecule that has the specificity of the mouse antibody but the
overall structure of the human antibody.
Len, Vernon Oi and a woman named Sherie Morrison recognized
this could be done. This was their thing and they did it beautifully. I was a
supporter, but I was not involved. To my recollection, I was not involved
even in developing the understanding of why this was really important. I
probably was, but I don’t remember. This was stuff that Len and Vernon
led on. It took seventeen years for their patent to be approved.
Ultimately, this patent paid huge royalties to Stanford. It in no way
restricted what antibodies could be used with this technology so, unlike the
monoclonal antibody patents, we had no problem with this patent.
Kiefer: Wow.
Herzenberg: [01:28:04] The length of the approval process made this patent what’s called
a submarine patent. It was, I think, the last of the submarine patents. It was
there all the time, constantly being questioned and revised, questioned and
revised, and finally they granted it.
Kiefer: Is that what the term “submarine” means?
Herzenberg: [01:28:20] Yes, submarine patent means that it’s been there, it has the dates,
and the way the dating worked for the patent at that time, you got the patent
for a certain number of years when they issued it, rather than from the time
you applied for it. They changed that because of the submarine problem.
This was a prime example of it, but there were probably other ones.

117

Anyway, this patent and its underlying technology allowed people to
make therapeutic antibodies. By the time the patent was granted, people
understood how to make a therapeutic antibody that would actually help for
disease. It is what’s called Remicade [infliximab]. This one was a therapeutic
that will alleviate severe rheumatoid arthritis, a really, really important very
broadly used reagent and a very important patent.
All of these monoclonal antibodies therapies are based originally on
the hybrid antibodies. Now there’s some other ways of doing this, but it’s all
basically the same principle.
This patent, because it was used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, has
generated tens of millions for Stanford, so this was the big patent. There
were other patents that generated lots of money as well, but this was the
very big one.
Kiefer: Some professors and researchers have their own companies on the side that
maybe they put together with graduate students or with colleagues. Did you
and Len have anything like that?
Herzenberg: [01:30:09] We worked with Becton Dickinson. Len got a pittance. Actually,
they originally made a deal with Len that was a beautiful deal, and we would
have gotten, like, a penny for every reagent they sold, which would have
been a fortune. Then Bernie, who represented us but also represented the
company, came back and said, “No, they’ll break the contract. They won’t
let you have it.” Len didn’t care, really. Neither he nor I really—we’re
academics. We didn’t think we needed to make millions of dollars. We just
needed to make enough to be able to do our research and live the good life.

118

We just were not in the business. It was a different time, maybe, or maybe
just we’re old-fashioned, but it didn’t matter enough to Len to make us
change our life style.
Of course, we could have gone out and started a monoclonal
antibody company, we could have done other things, but it’s not what Len
wanted to do, it’s not what I wanted to do. So we’re still in that same
situation. I have software that’s under development right now—it’s taken us
a long time to get there—that could make a lot of money for us. But I don’t
really want to run a company and I don’t want to be involved. I have tried
to run some companies just because I couldn’t get any company with
traction to actually get behind this. So we did try and set up our own
software company. I’m lousy at this. I don’t want to spend the time at it.
Len was lousy at it. And all we did was lose money in those companies.
That’s all we did. We put money into them and we lost it, because it’s not
what we want to do. You have to really want to do this. You have to be
willing to be nasty. You have to be willing to keep things to yourself and not
talk about science that you want to talk about. It just was never what we
wanted to do.
So with Bernie, Len built BDIS. That company is now a $2-billion
company at least, and really he and Bernie built this. Bernie is not
particularly appreciated for it. He’s still alive. He’s a curmudgeon, and he
never had much use for me as a woman in this game. He always felt that
Len gave me too much, because his wife was not treated that way. I think

119

Edith actually didn’t feel that women should be included. She could talk a
good game, but she didn’t really believe that they should be.
I really don’t know. Bernie never wanted to recognize any of my
contributions, and Len would get up and say that this was done by Lee, or
Lee and I together. And Bernie would say, “Why are you saying that? You’re
spoiling things.” Because the men in his company, who ran his company,
were very conservative, and they did not recognize women.
They did not like to recognize somebody without a tie either, and
Len went to meetings without a tie. Bernie just didn’t approve of all this.
The world left him behind because he just absolutely refused to allow the
world to let women in, allow the world to let people with ties in, the whole
thing.
Kiefer: What was the first? Dickinson and what was the front?
Herzenberg: [01:33:52] Becton.
Kiefer: OK. What’s coming to mind is Beckman Instruments.
Herzenberg: [01:33:58] That’s right. Everybody’s very confused. Beckman, there’s
another whole story there, not with Arnold Beckman, but Beckman
Instruments eventually bought Coulter Instruments, and Coulter was the
other person who made a cell sorter and made a business out of it. Wallace
Coulter would hate me to say this, but it’s true: he was always too little too
late.
Coulter eventually had people working with him (Mack Fulwyler, in
particular) who had given Len the original plans for the drive train for the
cell analysis and sorting part of the sorter. They essentially laid out how you

120

would do this, and built a particle sorter that Len realized could be used for
fluorescent cell sorting. Len went to them and he said, “Would you put
fluorescence detection on to this?”
And they said, “No, it’s not our mission.” They worked for Los
Altos. They were doing fallout stuff, which to Len was anathema to begin
with. But they were doing this stuff and they wouldn’t put fluorescence
measurements in. Instead they said, “But we’ll give you the plans.”
They were good guys and they gave us the plans, and we came back
and we built the sorter, starting with their plans. However, their plans
showed a nozzle on it of the type that Coulter had. We built it first that way,
but the nozzle had problems and had to be taken off and replaced with the
nozzle that we invented here. So it wasn’t their instrument that became the
prototype for the FACS that Becton, Dickinson eventually built.
Kiefer: As you worked at Stanford, did the university or the med school ever give
you any problems as a woman involved in research?
Herzenberg: It depends on what you mean by problems. They never gave me any
recognition as a woman involved in research. [laughs]
There’s a long story with this. There was a Women’s Committee set
up at some point to try and recognize women. I somehow must have asked
them to help me get recognized at some point because I remember that
their answer was, “Well, you work with your husband, and we can’t tell
what’s what.”

121

I said, “Gee, thank you. I’ve got papers. I’m the first author on them.
You can tell what’s what.” But, no, I really never got any recognition from
them.
In Josh’s world, he was happy to have me, but partly because of
Esther, I guess. But he was very careful. “Len, you have to be really careful
if Lee’s working with you to be sure that you don’t give her more than you
should give. You don’t want it to look like nepotism.” We agreed, and
accepted much more stringency in what recognition I was given because we
didn’t want our working relationship to have any appearance of nepotism.
So I didn’t get promotion and lived outside the system.
I was not allowed to write my own grants, but I wrote them under
Len’s name and Len signed off and included a statement that I was actually
leading the project. I wrote my grants, and in fact I wrote Len’s grants,
because Len never wrote anything ever. He did not write. He told me what
he wanted, I wrote it, I corrected what needed correction, we argued out any
disagreements, and I corrected it according to the way he finally wanted it,
et cetera. He never wrote anything—I mean, he wrote letters, but even
those he’d give to me and say, “Put it into English.” Remember, I was an
English major in high school, right? He always said, “You were an English
major. That’s what you wanted to do, creative writing. Do it.” [laughs]
So there it was. Len and I worked together. I published my papers. I
loved what I was doing. But I never got a promotion while Josh was chair.
Maybe I was promoted to senior technician or something like that.

122

Then Josh left and Stan Cohen took over. There were some people in
the department who pushed for me to get some sort of adjunct faculty
appointment so that I could apply for my grants, and they felt that I should.
One of those people wound up having to go elsewhere. He did fine. He’s
not complaining that he had to go elsewhere, but it was in part because he
was pushing on this thing. I’m sure Stan regrets it at this point and would
say he didn’t really mean it quite that way.
After all, I didn’t have a formal degree. The, one day, Pierre-André
Cazenave at the Pasteur Institute was talking about me with Len and Pierre
asked something about my degree, and Len replied, “Well, she never got a
formal degree.”
And he said, “Well, she did her work here at Pasteur Institute, didn’t
she?”
And he said, “Yes, she was working with Jacques at that time, and
she relates to that a lot.”
He said, “Well, she speaks French.”
Len said, “Yes, she speaks it.”
“Well,” he said, “she could actually get her degree at the Sorbonne,
and I’d be honored if she’d consider herself my student.” So that got set up
where Pierre-André became my advisor. He worked very closely in the field
I’m working in, so that’s why this happened.
Kiefer: It looks like this was around 1981.
Herzenberg: [01:39:49] Yes, that sounds right. I eventually wrote a thesis. The date is in
the thesis. Then it took three years for the thesis to get accepted because

123

Pierre-André kept forgetting to put the papers in. He was famous for this. It
wasn’t just me. However, the students in his lab would keep tabs on him so
that their papers would get in on time. So I finally got somebody who was in
France who would follow Pierre-André around and make sure he put the
papers in.
My thesis was in an area that was directly related to Pierre-Andre’s
work. So it was straightforward for him to start the degree process in the
usual way by constituting a thesis committee for me. The committee
included Klaus Rajewsky, the foremost scientist in our field, Spedding
Micklem, a renowned stem cell expert, and Sam Black. Sam was “only” just
a beginning professor at Amherst, but he understood the work. I can’t
remember who else was on the committee, but I am sure there was
someone from the Sorbonne in addition to Pierre-Andree. I submitted the
thesis, gave a formal thesis talk to my committed, and the thesis was
accepted with honors. The only other thing I had to show was that I spoke
French fluently, which I do. It is a requirement because you have to be able
to teach at the Sorbonne. I think Pierre, with whom I normally spoke
French, attested to my proficiency.
So I completed the requirements and then became formally doctorat
d’Etat. So I had finally had a respectable degree. When I came back and told
Stan this, he questioned whether it was real. I was kind of indignant and I
said, “Of course it’s real.”
He said, “Well, I don’t know.” But he still was not willing to give me
any promotion.

124

By this time, in order to submit this at Sorbonne, basically you’re
submitting for what would be an associate to full professorship. That is
what the degree actually meant in France. You could teach classes at the
Sorbonne and you were a professor at the Sorbonne, or could be if you
chose to join the faculty. They had a different system.
They had a different system there (it has changed again, now).
Anyway, at that time I could have just decided, “I want to move to France”
and I would have had the right to teach in France.
But Stan was not really willing to accept this. To my understanding—
and this is only secondhand gossip -- there was a committee that
investigated the department. Josh had gone and Stan had taken over, and
they had an investigation of the department, and apparently the one action
that the committee insisted on for the committee was that I should be
promoted to research associate, I think it was.
Anyway, I was appointed as a Research Associate, and later I was
promoted to senior research associate. This promotion gave me the right to
ask for permission to get my own grants, so that I could finally sign my
grants myself.
Len had to always write a letter saying, “This is Lee’s work and she
did this.” And people who knew us well said that the discussion at the study
section was not whether this was Lee’s work. Everybody knew it was.
They’d heard me speak. My friend sat on one of the study sections and told
me this story said the question discussed at the study section was whether
Len or I wrote the letter that said it was [the work in the grant was my own

125

work]. [laughs] I laughed when I heard this and said, “Well, you know how
we write in this lab.”
Kiefer: Eventually you ended up with the title of research professor, is that correct?
Herzenberg: [01:43:28] Yes.
Kiefer: But that took about thirty years till about 1989?
Herzenberg: [01:43:33] I don’t know. There was no real counting. When David Botstein
took over the department, he promoted me, I guess, to associate professor,
and that’s when I got my formal right to apply for research grants. He was a
good guy, David, and he basically appointed me co-terminus with my grants.
My current department chair just said, “Oh, just forget about the coterminus part. You’re in the department till you die.” [laughs] So I’m still
sort of an anomaly in the department, but the current chair is wonderful. I
love working with him.
Kiefer: And that is who?
Herzenberg: [01:45:02] It’s Michael Snyder. I’m working quite closely with him. We share
a graduate student now. He’s wonderful. He had a close friend when he was
at Yale (before Stanford) who was one of our students [Paula Kavathas]. He
had a lot of respect for her. She was mainly Len’s student, but of course I
knew her well (in part from helping to write papers with her). So Mike knew
a lot about us when he came. We couldn’t understand why he just seemed
to know us, but he was very welcoming and made us feel more in the
department than we had felt for a very long time, because he just knew who
we were and how we ran the lab and what we did.

126

Mike also appreciated that the department gets a good chunk of that
patent money. But it’s not something we have a control over. It just comes
from the school. That patent money comes in, goes to the school, and gets
distributed out, but we get a big chunk of it. Years ago when there was
patent money coming in or any kind of money coming in for stuff we had
done, we’d all signed a statement,—Len and all of us,—saying that that
money really was acquired because of work we did in the lab and therefore
should be donated back to the lab. That was what we did in the beginning.
It then came to be that people would leave the lab, but they would
get patent money, and there was really no reason for them to donate that
back to the lab. Then if that were true, well, then there’s no reason if you
stayed in the lab why you have to donate it back. So we went to the
university policy, which is that the inventor gets a certain share and they can
do what they want with it.
But the money we got from patents we have always fed back into the
lab as much as we needed to. I just now, in this last week, committed to
feed a fair amount back in again because we’ve just made a new finding that
requires that there be some more people working in the lab doing this work,
and grants are just awful to get. I’m going to be paying for several people
for a while who I would hope I will not to have to pay for indefinitely. But it
is good to have this patent money to keep the lab supported with. Actually,
the patent money will end soon so I have to be careful with support to
make it last.
Kiefer: What are some of the sources of the grants that you’ve had over time?

127

Herzenberg: [01:47:27] Always the NIH.
Kiefer: The National Institutes of Health.
Herzenberg: [01:47:32] Yes. Some of it from the National Library of Medicine. A lot of it
over the last few years has been the Division of AIDS, but mainly because
it’s all computer stuff and they need what we’re developing, and that’s what
we’ve just developed. That’s why now I need to make this stuff so it can go
out to people. We’ve just developed this absolutely gorgeous stuff. I’m so
pleased with it.
Kiefer: That’s wonderful.
Herzenberg: [01:47:58] Jumping up and down!
Kiefer: Back a while ago, when you talked about the neighborhood culture that you
grew up in, you also mentioned that you were part of the Federation of
American Scientists and that politics were important to you.
Herzenberg: [01:48:17] Yes.
Kiefer: How important are politics to you in particular, but also to Len over the
years? And when I say “politics,” maybe you could define that for me if it’s
Democrat or if it goes beyond that, what would you say?
Herzenberg: [01:48:45] It goes beyond that. University politics are of no interest to us,
have never been of interest, but then again, they’ve never been interested in
us either. That probably started in the 1970s or the late 1960s, actually,
because although we were older, our colleagues did not understand where
we were, because we moved into the counterculture. We knew about
smoking marijuana. We never, neither Len nor I ever did any other drugs
but marijuana. We knew lots of people who were taking acid [LSD]. That

128

was OK for them, but Len and I felt that we had kids and we didn’t want to
take any risks with there being a problem due to the drug. So we wouldn’t
do any drugs other than marijuana. But we were in the hippie culture, if you
like. It’s not really hippie. Hippie was the apolitical side of it.
So we helped to establish the Palo Alto Free University, which was a
very, very important force during the late 1960s and early seventies. Len
helped to establish a group called the Technology and Science Committee
that ran coincident with the Free University and helped engineers who
didn’t want to work for Lockheed get out and work for non-defense
industries. In fact, the FACS engineers that we have in our lab are all from
that time. One of them was kind of apolitical and he joined the lab because
he was already an established engineer and ours was an interesting
engineering project. He was working for Varian when Varian was interested
in a project that included flow cytometry. Varian decided to close down the
interesting, flow cytometry related part of the project, which this fellow
[Dick Sweet] was working on. He had special skills related to flow cytometry
and Len was devastated that Varian’s closing the project would disrupt his
work with Len. So I said to Len, “Well, why don’t you ask him to come
work for us?”
Len said, “Dick’s an established engineer. He’s never going to come
over here.”
I said, “What? Are you crazy? How do you know? Go ask him, ask
him, ask him, ask him.”
“All right, all right, all right. I’ll ask him.” [laughs]

129

And Dick [Sweet] said, “I’d be delighted to come to Stanford and
work with you on the FACS.” He was the guy who invented the inkjet
printer, which we use as a principle in the FACS instrument. We steer the
thing the same way as you would ink to print letters. So that’s a central part
of the FACS, and that’s how Len got him to come work with us.
Kiefer: Oh, is he the Sweet of Sweet Hall?
Herzenberg: [01:51:29] No, not he. I don’t think it’s the same family even. But Dick had
been at Stanford. He has an interesting history. He was also part of this sort
of radical-ish group.
The whole group of engineers that I was talking about earlier, who
played ping-pong down with us in our “recreation” room, were all more or
less leftish. We were all kind of leftish in one way or another. There were a
few people like Elliott Levinthal, who was the head of that engineering
group, who were straight Democratic, much more Democratic. They
favored the war in Vietnam long after we had all become “anti-war” and
were joining protests. Henry Kaplan himself took until 1971, but he then
came out and made a major, very, very important statement against the war.
So the University itself was largely against the war, but that said,
that’s not true. It was mainly the students and many faculty. The university
was largely pro-war, and the engineering department was really gung-ho. But
the medical school was more or less divided along “surgeon” lines, although
a lot of the surgeons were counterculture. Mainly, it was just the more
conservative M.D.’s, mainly older, who favored the war.

130

Oh, put down on this list we have to talk about: Medicare. I forgot to
tell you about Medicare. That’s an important one. These are all interesting
things that happened back there.
Politics was just important, a very important part of life. I mean, I
grew up that. My family were Democrats, and a big issue was being for or
against segregation. At that time, to be a Democrat meant to be anti-black.
But we didn’t agree with that party view. My father was a Roosevelt
democrat. That was different. We didn’t like the segregation part of the
party. We were mavericks. My father was certainly anti-segregation, as were
my family, my uncle, my brother. My brother hung out with the Pete Seeger
crowd. My uncle hung out with that crowd.
So I was always brought up to be more or less counterculture and
leftist, and it was not any great movement for me to recognize that I
belonged with the counterculture. I was never hippie. I didn’t particularly
approve of the kids who were going up and sitting on the street. So one of
our engineers got the idea to teach them to bake nutritious bread, and we all
worked with helping them to learn to bake bread so they could eat. I think it
eventually got name “digger bread”. We did a lot of things.
The acid (LSD) culture and the Merry Pranksters were around Palo
Alto at the time. I never really got tied into them. They regarded me as too
straight because we were scientists. And we were straight, really. I mean, we
had our brains to keep together. We had activities we were turning out.
They were busily counterculturing because they were creative artists who
could afford to counterculture. We needed to keep our focus on our work

131

Kiefer: Didn’t Ken Kesey live on Perry Lane?
Herzenberg: [01:55:30] He did, at least I think so. That was right where Gus Nossal
(from our part of the Genetics Department) had lived. The Pranksters and
their friends were all in this area and we were connected to them through
the Free University. Everyone was connected. So we all knew each other.
I used to run rock concerts. I ran a lot of rock concerts around here
as benefits, like for the Stanford Day Care Center. I was probably a key
driving force because I was older and maybe more organized than most of
the people. I was working with a lot of other people, people who recruited
the bands and people who did this and did that. So I was just one of the
pillars of running Frost Amphitheatre rock concerts.
We ran the concerts until a concert by Sly and the Family Stone,
which made it clear that the culture had moved somewhere else, and we
didn’t want to be in the business anymore. Too many crazies and too many
people running around on acid and worse, doing all sorts of stuff that really
wasn’t—it was the disintegration of the counterculture as we knew it.
But I spent a lot of time doing this work. We helped start the
Stanford Nursery School [Day Care Center]. There was no childcare center
before that, so we established that and we ran concerts, we collected money
that way to pay for the nursery school and to do other things like that. My
son was in the first class. So I loved it.
The music was very important to me. My daughter was into music.
We used to run something called Free People’s Free Music. We were just
talking about it the other day. We should reopen it again. There were a lot of

132

kids then—remember we were in the hippie era, and there were a lot of kids
just sitting around on the street doing nothing. So we said, “Well, let’s run a
concert every Friday night.” And we just used local bands and we got a
sound system and we ran the concert and mad a constructive place for the
kids to be.
My God, we had to fight the police on this. All we did was to put a
concert downtown on Lytton Square that was had every Friday night. My
daughters and friends had a place to go, and there was something happening
on Friday night that was wholesome. “You’re bringing all the worst
elements in here,” we were told. Anything that happened anywhere within a
twenty-five-mile radius, practically, they blamed on that concert. But we did
it.
The main guy who ran “Free Peoples Free Music” with me--actually I
ran it with him -- Tim Gadus was about 19 years old at the time. I was the
grandma of the group, and there were some younger guys who actually did
much of the thinking and all the running. But I was there and I just saw to it
that people were properly treated all the time and that we all kept our brains
together.
Timmy eventually became an important administrator here at
Stanford. He is still a delightful guy, a grandfather now. He just laughs when
he remembers himself when he worked in our animal house.
Len offered him a job in the animal house because he was basically
starving. He was a really smart kid with not much education and no family.

133

He came to our house one day and he just lay down across one of the
chairs. He was just obviously wiped and starving.
Len looked at him and said, “Timmy, do you want a job?”
Timmy: “I’ll take any job,” Timmy answered
Len: “Even changing mouse cages?”
Timmy: “What do you have to do?”
Len: “It’s easy.”
Timmy, “OK, I’ll take it.”
In the end, Timmy became top animal care technician, then
graduated to being top research assistant in the lab, and ultimately moved
into the Stanford facilities administration group, where he is one of the
long-term top people.
And we’ve done this. We’ve had a number of kids like this who’ve
come in untrained and gone out as students or doing other kinds of
responsible jobs. Essentially it’s a rescue route for kids.
We’ve got another one started just now. She’s coming through the
lab, and she’s going to be a first-rate research assistant. So we just start them
in the animal room, and then, unfortunately, they get too good for the
animal rooms. [laughs] Then we have to move them to lab work, and give
them a helper for the animal room. But then the helper comes up through
the ranks, et cetera. So it all works out nicely.
Kiefer: Do you encourage them to get degrees?
Herzenberg: [01:59:15] If they will, they will. Timmy never did. He just grew up through
the ranks. But he knows the facilities at Stanford. As I said, he became a

134

high-level facilities manager. He sits on all these big committees. It’s
delightful, you know. Every so often we get together for some reason or
another, and we’ll just be amused at how good everything is -- that the fifth
grandchild was just born and that all these kinds of nice things keep
happening.
Kiefer: Great. What was the Free University?
Herzenberg: [01:59:45] So the Free University was a concept that came from Europe, but
part of it began here in this [my] house in my back room. There were four
or five political science students, political science and history. We knew
them because one of them was the son of one of our professors at Brooklyn
College and got in touch with us. This has to be 1962, just after we moved
into the house.
I can still see the bedroom, the fireplace was not quite finished, and
they were all sitting in one corner. They were furious because they were not
allowed to have classes in Marxism, some aspect of Marxism, I think maybe
Marxism itself, but they weren’t allowed to have classes in economics of the
type that they really wanted to learn and have a class on.
Kiefer: At Stanford or—
Herzenberg: [02:00:52] Stanford. So they wanted to protest this, and then finally they
decided, “Hell, we’re never going to get this at Stanford. We’ll start our own
university.” So they started the academic side of the Free University.
The Merry Pranksters and their cohorts, they’re fringier people, not
they themselves, because that’s not what they did. Some of the fringe people
from their group started the what we used to call Sand Candle side -- people

135

who liked to go to the beach and make sand candles. They were very good
candle-makers. But they wanted to learn, do and teach more counter-culture
things than just candle making – things like artwork and photography and
running “encounter groups”. So we merged this all into the Free University.
There was always this interesting tension between the more academic side
and the less academic side of the “Free U”, but we all took part in both.
Len taught a course in domino theory. The domino theory, if you
remember, was that all of Vietnam and Laos and all these things would fall
if we pulled out. But as a joke, Len called the class “domino theory”. We
used to play dominoes all the time. So he gave a domino theory course, in
which people played dominoes and taught each other how to play well.
We, the Free U started a coffeehouse on the corner where Rudyard’s
Pub is now, around on the circle there.
Kiefer: On University Avenue?
Herzenberg: [02:02:16] That’s right. It was called the Full Circle, and that was great.
That’s where, actually, we first met Wayne [Moore], who works with us.
The Free U had its own printing press that used to print lots of
documents and stuff, and that was Marshall and Sherry. Before Sherry met
Marshall and “settled down”, she used to play guitar with Jerry Garcia
upstairs in the building that we turned into the coffee house. Wayne
wandered into town as a nineteen-year-old and started washing dishes at the
Free U at the Full Circle. Our daughter, Berri, was washing dishes there as
well, so she got to know Wayne.

136

Sherry and Marshall found him homeless, sort of wandering around
town, and they said, “There’s this nice kid, he’s nineteen or so, and just
floating around, doesn’t seem too bright. But very sweet. We gave him a
room in our house. If you could give him a job as an animal caretaker—”
It just happened that we had no animal caretaker at that time. They
kept turning over (this was before Timmy). So we gave Wayne a job as an
animal caretaker. Best animal caretaker we ever had in our lives.
Wayne turned into one of our best friends, and one of the best
software engineers we have ever met. We are still very close. He is just solid
and totally brilliant. He went back to school, kept working with us and
eventually wrote or directed the writing of all of the software we have
developed.
Today Wayne is one of my closest friends. But he came in through
the same route Timmy came. He was in Free People’s Free Music, worked
at the coffeehouse, finally went to Stanford and has been doing high level
software ever since. He is also doing very high level mathematical physics
and my ultimately solve one of the key questions in that world. I talk with
him about this all the time. I don’t understand it all, but Wayne makes it
understandable, at least in part. I love following his progress.
The Free U time was a very interesting time. Part of me lived in that
counterculture. I wore skirts to the lab all the time, come home, take my
skirts off, put my jeans on, and then just be there, in the counter-culture.
Len was there, too, a little less counter-culturish than me, but always there.
He also played key leadership roles in that community.

137

We helped to publish what was called the Research Guidelines for the
Student Movement, 1969 Student Movement, and through that I met Dave
Parks, who’s another one of our very long-term friends. He was a Stanford
graduate student in physics but is now also a biologist. He has worked in the
lab since the early 1980s, or before. He took over the FACS project after
Dick Sweet (the engineer from Varian) decided that he really would work on
the project, but that he didn’t want to lead or manage it. David took it over.
So it was all this integration. OK. Political life integrated to lab life,
integrated to political life. Neither Len nor I really made a distinction, but
we had our own responsibilities. Len was sitting on study sections. He was
traveling around the country. We were speaking at meetings. The lab was
growing. We were teaching. It was consistent with all this. I think the only
ones who suffered were our daughters. [laughs] They had to fend a lot more
for themselves than, as they see it now, they really wanted to.
Kiefer: And that does beg the question, how did you manage with four children and
all this activity?
Herzenberg: [02:05:10] Well, only three really. Michael has Down Syndrome, and we
knew that when he was born. They thought he would die within a year, and
I didn’t want my girls to have to live through a dying brother, so I put him
into a foster home. His foster mother turned out to be a wonderful woman.
She saved his life and he lived with her forever. He found her when she
died. He now lives in a foster home with several other wonderful women
who are really good to him.

138

But my two girls, they will tell you that some of our counterculture
ways were very disruptive for them. We did things that now they will tell
me, “Well, you know, that wasn’t the right thing.”
And I just said, “Well, you’ll tell me what was the right thing, but I
don’t know.” [laughs] “I can tell you why I did them, I can say to you I’m
sorry if it hurt you, I can say to you that I’m glad that it helped you, but it
was what we did.” We did what we did it thinking that we were doing the
best things for them. Len and talked about this a great deal at the time, and
we talked a lot with them, too. We were always very open with the girls.
Kiefer: So we were just saying about you coping with the kids and how you were
dealing with grass (marijuana) and them, and I assume they were teenagers.
Herzenberg: [02:06:39] Well, it’s not grass that was the problem. It was just the openness
of what was going on here. When there were violent demonstrations, we
were always on the nonviolent side of the meeting and against the violence.
The rock-throwing and stuff was not something we approved, but it was
something that was happening – a part of the movement. That kind of
massive violence we could say we don’t support, but we understand why
young people are throwing these rocks. They were throwing rocks at
building windows, so, you know, big deal. Nobody’s getting hurt, but there
is property damage. And given what was being damaged in the Vietnam War
and what the fabric of the country was damaged, we could live with that.
We could not live with any kind of other violence. Bombings, violence, stuff
like that. We never knew anybody that was involved in that and never
wanted to. Maybe I did know them, but I didn’t know who they were.

139

And it turned out that the most violent person on campus was an
FBI informer, and that I did know, and that I did actual legal research on
because there was a trial and we had to collect information. It turned out we
wound up researching this one guy who then turned out to be an informer,
and he was being run by FBI. He was a provocateur, basically, and they
knew it. There was no question. He was the one who shot the holes in the
president’s windows. He was the one who shot the holes in Dinkelspiel. He
was the one who broke the glass at some sit-in where was a big piece of
glass was broken. He did the violent acts that enabled other people to just
do this, and he led the rock-throwing. There was no question that he led it
and stimulated it.
I disapproved of it, I never went to it, but I supported the goals of
the movement and I understood why nineteen-year-old kids would do this.
We were a hospital section. At one point, this table [in our house] was a
hospital section because kids were having teargas canisters thrown at them
and all sorts of things, and they came here for help on that night.
So our kids were exposed to all of this. Their friends—they were
teenagers -- their friends were in the movement—.they were close friends
with some people who later were involved in much more serious stuff.
The part of the movement that I was in was opposed to the
Revolutionary Union, opposed to Venceremos, opposed to any of the overt
violence. The guy we more or less followed was a guy named Lenny Siegel
who said, “I’m all in favor of violence when 51 percent of the people are
doing it.” [laughs]

140

Kiefer: Lenny Siegel?
Herzenberg: Do you know his name? I just saw him. We just had a reunion of the April
Third Movement. This was called the April Third Movement. How do you
know Lenny?
Kiefer: My husband worked in in information systems at Polya Hall and that whole
area, and he was around the day that Bruce Franklin led the charge in there.
Herzenberg: [02:10:24] Bruce Franklin didn’t lead that charge.
Kiefer: Really?
Herzenberg: [02:10:27] I’ll tell you exactly what happened, because I was there.
Kiefer: Really?
Herzenberg: [02:10:30] Lenny and Yale Braunstein and I had a meeting that was kept
secret from Bruce. He did not know there would be a sit-in there, and he
did not know that we organized a pre-meeting on White Plaza. Bruce was
the last person to speak at the meeting because he was not invited to speak.
He was definitely not invited to lead the sit-in, but Bruce being the
Venceremos leader didn’t want to be left behind. He put himself in front of
the crowd after they started walking and said, “OK. Let’s go”
Everybody was all ready. The sit-in was already started. Lenny and
these people had mapped out Polya Hall. I was part of the discussion. I
attended the meeting.
I had certain things that I did for the movement. As I said, I brought
chicken soup to the movement all the time. Not literally, but I was chicken
soup.

141

Anyway, I was on the corner. Bruce was here still talking at the
microphone. White Plaza was there. I was walking out towards the front of
the Union. We walked to Polya Hall, maybe by the other side of the Union.
I can’t remember exactly. I can see myself and I remember Bruce standing
at the microphone. It was the last speaker, and he said, “OK, come on, let’s
go.” Everybody had gone. The police were standing there, thought Bruce
was leading it, Bruce thought he was leading it, but the key people had
already gone and were already over at the hall, sitting in.
Now, when the hearings were held, I told this story. You can find
this in the testimony in the hearings. I told this story at that time, and I told
them exactly who had planned Polya Hall, because we took responsibility
for it. But Bruce himself was going to claim that he—he would rather be
fired for something he didn’t do and say that he didn’t do it. [laughs]
He just did something very good, though. At Rutgers, they were
going to have Condi Rice as their commencement speaker, and this was too
much for Bruce and Jane. They and their friends told the students who
Condi Rice was, and the students said, “No, we don’t want this person to be
there.” They were right, this was the right thing to do, and they got another
commencement speaker. So they were very proud of the fact that they’d
done that. And I was glad to hear it.
Kiefer: To kind of wrap things up, I’m going to ask you were you ever actually
formally involved in the Women’s Movement?
Herzenberg: [02:13:20] Probably not, probably not. I mean, the stuff at Stanford was run
by—I guess Dody [Dora] Goldstein was the one who did most of it. I don’t

142

know. I don’t even know who did. I never really got together—was part of
that. As I said, they told me that I worked for my husband, they didn’t know
what to do about me, which I thought wasn’t sisterly of them. [laughs]
Kiefer: Right. Now, about the “they” that we’re talking about who said, “Well, no,
you work with your husband.” Were these the people running a study of
women in the med school who said publications with women as authors
weren’t out there as much?
Herzenberg: [02:14:22] I don’t know who they were. What happened actually, which was
very important, was Hal Holman was the head of medicine. Rose Payne and
Judy Pool worked for Hal Holman. Rose Payne was a very good friend. She
was an old lefty from the Union Movement, and her husband was a
longshoreman. They used to take us down to the Longshoremen’s Hall to
meetings. They were great people.
Rose was actually the founder of transplantation biology, of
measuring what was needed for that, and Walter Bodmer worked with her.
She wasn’t in our department, she was in medicine, but she was all part of
this.
People recognized that Rose Payne and Judy Pool were eminent
scientists, were well recognized outside of Stanford, but had never received
an appointment. I was probably as well recognized as them. But I could go
to all the key immunology meetings because Len was invited. I didn’t have
to be invited. Eventually, we were both invited to the meetings. We were a
different generation. They were a little older than me. So I was part of the
group that was pushing for appointments for Rose and Judy.

143

It was kind of a very big shame because Hal Holman, who failed to
appoint them, was the chair of Medicine. In other things, he was the big
liberal, OK? “Liberal” is not the name he would like me to apply, but
“radical” would probably be the right name. To his shame, he never thought
it was important to appoint these women; or if he did think it was
important, he never made it clear that he met enough opposition that he
couldn’t appoint them.
I think that was the bottom line. But Hal did very important things in
building the department, very, very important. He was also one of the
people who were with us in the movement, and a very strong supporter of
the Federation of American Scientists, which included our friends from
Paris, Dale Kaiser and Dave Hogness. We had that group here. There was
already a Stanford branch when we moved out here from Washington. Hal
became part of that. He was part of the Physicians for Social Responsibility.
So there were a bunch of these little groups, but none of them
focused on women. I don’t know who made the fuss about Rose. It might
have been Walter. I don’t know who made that fuss, but I certainly was glad
they made it and felt part of it.
But I’ve always been somewhat miffed that there’s a lecture that
honors women every year here, and I have never been asked to talk at that. I
usually don’t go to the lecture. This is my “bad”. You could say if you don’t
go to the lecture, you won’t be asked to talk at it. OK, it kind of goes both
ways.

144

But I’m too radical, my science is too radical, for a lot of the women.
Over this year, we have been proving a theory that I put forward that Len
joined me in signing—but it was my stuff—that the immune system evolved
as a set of layers in which each layer did all the different things in the
immune system, but each layer was more advanced and more protective
than the last. The current idea that you have a single stem cell—everybody
talks about the stem cell—is incorrect. You have a set of stem cells that are
layered on top of one another.
So we’ve finally, after all these years, proven that the two major
branches of the stem cell go all the way back to the two-week-old embryo in
the mouse, less than two weeks, ten days or nine days. And yesterday we
found that, in fact, in the human the same thing is true. It’s just beautiful
stuff. My fellow, he put it together. I have two really phenomenal fellows in
the lab, probably because I could just use the patent money to support them
when the grants ran out. So I could keep the team together.
Anyway, this is very radical science. It has parted me from the
majority, and it parted me from the majority in another particular thing that
has to do with regulatory T-cells. So I’ve always run science more radically.
And what we’ve done is the FACS, which was mainly Len’s thing to build. I
did science with what he built all the time, implementing and testing and
changing features, et cetera. Len led the engineers, got them to build what
we needed, my group implemented the science side, found out what more
was needed, started another round of building, et cetera.

145

We’re just up for another layer of this now. We just finished
reporting it out at the meeting in Florida, which I wouldn’t go to because I
hate Florida. But we were a triumph there, and that’s going to come back
and we’ll have a new layer of ability to do science.
But my thing is to hang out with the heavy mathematicians who can,
in fact, put this stuff together. The immunologists are really not able to do
this, so they all don’t like me. [laughs] It’s not that they don’t like me
because I’m a woman. They don’t like what I do. I’m radical in what I do,
I’ve always been radical, and my politics were radical when there was such a
thing as radical politics. If there was again some kind of radical politics, I’d
probably join it, but there’s nothing to join right now.
Kiefer: I know you’ve received a lot of awards, but what award or awards are you
the most proud of?
Herzenberg: [02:20:33] I haven’t received a lot of awards.
Kiefer: No?
Herzenberg: [02:20:37] Not that I—I mean, you can count them. There are a lot of
awards. But I don’t know. What have I received awards for? You know,
Eleanor Roosevelt Fellowships, these are just fellowships. They’re awards,
but they’re nothing so special. The Smithsonian Awards are very nice, and
that has to do with the relationships that I developed with the SAS Institute,
work I had done with them.
When Len received the Kyoto Prize, he argued with them, “Why
don’t you give it to Lee as well? Because we really did this together.”

146

And they said, “No, we only give it to one person,” and they gave it
to Len.
Len was almost going to turn down the award, to show people he
really meant that we did this together, which we did. But I told Len, “Don’t
be silly. How can you turn that down? You go. It’s OK.”
Well, when he gave his acceptance speech, which for once I did not
write with him, he repeated that he felt I should have been awarded the
prize with him. Then, he argued the point with the Americans group that
presents the Kyoto Awards again in San Diego, a few months later.
Len won on this one. The group has a banquet and a meeting here
where they normally re-award the prize to the people who initially received
it in Kyoto. This time, they gave the award to both of us, had me give an
award lecture in addition to Len’s, et cetera.
This was not actually theirs to do, but they did it. Len told them that
he just did not want to accept the award here. He didn’t have to accept it
here, and he said he didn’t want to accept it here unless they included me, so
they did.
Kiefer: So the Kyoto Award is something that’s rooted in Japan?
Herzenberg: [02:22:14] It’s rooted in Japan, yes. It’s a very big award in Japan, and the
American version of it—they did study it. It was Len who brought it up to
them, and they studied it out, and they decided, yes, it was correct that we
should be both given that award.
So, those are all the awards. To me, the awards are the science and
the stuff we found. Len has always actually been on my case that I did not

147

seek out awards. He said, “Why don’t you join this committee? Why don’t
you do those things?”
And I said, “I’m busy. Leave me alone.”
I love what I’m doing. I can’t tell you how much I love the science.
Last night was such a triumph. I hung out with the guys till about ninethirty, and then they said, “The rest of it is all boring.”
So Erin, who’s my youngest graduate student, said, “Come on, I’ll
take you home.”
And Gigi was starving by then, so I just said, “OK, I’ll take Gigi
home and give her some food.”
Kiefer: And Gigi is that cute little white dog.
Herzenberg: [02:23:30] Uh-huh. Sixteen years old now.
Kiefer: You were interviewed in the Annual Review of Physiology last year by one of
your ex fellows…
Herzenberg: [02:23:38] Mario.
Kiefer: By Mario. And he was a postdoc of yours?
Herzenberg: [02:23:42] He was a postdoc.
Kiefer: Mario Roederer.
Herzenberg: [02:23:44] Roederer.
Kiefer: Towards the end of the interview, you said, “The purpose of all findings is
to be overturned. Interactions among people, those will stay forever.” Can
you elaborate on that?
Herzenberg: [02:23:58] Did I say that?
Kiefer: You did.

148

Herzenberg: [02:24:00] Oh, how beautiful. [laughs]
Kiefer: I thought it was.
Herzenberg: [02:24:02] That’s a great statement. Mario—that was a great interview. It
was fun working with Mario. He has just put a thirty-color FACS machine.
He’s made the next advance in the game. I want Mario’s machine, and I’m
just going to get one immediately. [laughs] It’s that kind of thing.
Well, it’s true. Einstein’s theory: Wayne is now looking at things—
maybe someone else will replace Einstein’s mathematics with something
which is totally consistent with it, but will overturn it in the sense of being
the final word. There is a better word that could be had. If Wayne doesn’t
do it, somebody else will.
Every science finding is only as far as man’s mind can take it when
you’re doing it. It can’t go further. As you learn new stuff, you get new
perspectives. You’re always finding new stuff that goes on.
Human interactions also change, but they don’t overturn. They don’t
go away because you have a new science finding. Maybe you can say that
was wrong. I guess you could say there were interactions you have that were
wrong, but the human interactions are for us now the thing that is the
important part of our life. I think I’d still stay with that.
Kiefer: Is there anything in your time at Stanford that you would have done
differently?
Herzenberg: [02:25:55] Oh, probably lots of things. [laughs] Yes and no. Maybe I would
have agreed with Len a little more that I should have fought for some more
stuff. I realized, something that he realized, that when he died or when he

149

stopped, I would lose a lot of stuff because we had balls in the air that we
were both maintaining. There were a lot of people who wanted to say it was
Len alone who did this and Lee just hung on. No. But you couldn’t say that
it was Lee alone who did this and Len that—it was both of us all the time.
But, yes, things got lost that were honors that came to him. He
regarded as being honors for both of us, and that was enough for me. But
when he’s gone, those honors are gone. So maybe I would have fought
harder and done the things that you need to do to get the honors myself. As
it was, I did them for Len to get the honors for him, because that was
enough for me. We just took the most judicious trip. And it never bothered
me not to get honors. It still doesn’t bother me not to get honors, but I see
what honors are valuable for, and I maybe realize that more so since he
died. Maybe I realized this before he died, but it didn’t seem important
enough then to matter. [laughs]
Kiefer: Sure.
Herzenberg: [02:27:33] We’ve got this new stuff that’s coming in. It’s going to get us
everything we need and more so. This is going to be a phenomenal year, and
I just wish that Len were here to enjoy it with me.
Kiefer: Yes. So you’re the head of the lab now?
Herzenberg: [02:27:48] I’m the head of the lab now.
Kiefer: OK. And finally, you were going to say something about Medicare.
Herzenberg: [02:27:55] Oh, yes, of course. 1961, Bob Mishell was a fellow of Hal
Holman’s. He came from a medical family but still a kind of a lefty family,
Jewish left, in Los Angeles, -- not red but left-ish.

150

I don’t remember how we met up with Bob. But at some point, this
was during the big Medicare fight, the original one, the argument of the
Medicare opponents was, “Your doctor doesn’t want you to do this.” And
Bob said, “Well, my father wants you to do this, and other doctors I know
want you to do this. This is really terrible that they’re saying this.”
So think it was the AMA [American Medical Association]—I some
branch thereof—ran an ad on the local classical music station. The ad said,
“It’s really nice when a Boy Scout helps an old lady across the street, but if
she doesn’t want to go across the street, he shouldn’t be helping her.” It was
a really an obnoxious anti-Medicare ad.
Bob said, “You know, I met that guy who runs that station that is
running the ad. He’s a friend of my father’s. I’ll call him up and ask him why
he is running this horrible ad.” So Bob called up the guy at the station -- I
remember him sitting in the lab and doing this. I can still see his back.
Anyway, after calling the guy at the station, Bob puts the phone
down and he says, “He didn’t want to run that ad. When he heard the ad, he
took it off that air, and it’s cost him $15,000” which at that time is like 150k
or more now.
The Bob said, “This is really too bad that he’s lost money. We should
get together and raise a little money so that we could put an ad on his
station and show him and others that if they do something responsible like
putting a good ad on for Medicare, that there’s a community that will
support this.”
Len and I said, “Yes, that’s great. Let’s do it”

151

We got together and we went to see Dan Feldman, I think, who was
a doctor of physical therapy at Stanford, I think. We went to see him and
asked, “What should we do?”
In the end, we all decided we should have a lecture, and charge
money and collect whatever we can from the house. We’ll pass the hat
around.
Well, Dan put us in touch with Philip R. Lee, who was the son of
Russell Lee. Now, Russell Lee started the Palo Alto Clinic. That was the first
group-practice plan anywhere in the United States, as far as I know, and it
was anathema to the AMA. They hated it because they didn’t believe in
group practice at the time. Isn’t that funny now? [laughs]
It turned out that Phil Lee happened to be my physician, so it was
kind of a small little world. We got together with Phil and told him what we
wanted to
Phil put us in touch with another patient of his named Jack – I forget
his last name. Len would remember his name. That was his job. [laughs]
Anyway, Jack was the science reporter for the Examiner, and he was the
third top science reporter in the country. He was really good.
We said, “Well, we just want to raise some money.”
And he said, “Phil is behind you. That means the Palo Alto Clinic is
behind raising some money for this and for saying we’re in favor of
Medicare.”
By that time, we had done what everybody did at that time, which
was to start a petition and pass it around the doctors and the medical

152

school. “Are you a doctor who believes in Medicare? Because the AMA was
saying the doctors don’t want you to support Medicare. We need to some
percentage of the doctors here?” That was the BACMA, the Bay Area
Committee for Medicare Acceptance, and in the end we got 25 percent of
all physicians in the country to sign that petition.
Jack started it by saying, “OK, if you want to get this to go, here’s
what you have to do.” He was a first-class publicist, and he said, “I need big
names.” So we went to Josh Lederberg and Arthur Kornberg, and they
signed the petition. Hal Holman and his parents, both physicians in the old
Stanford Medical School. And we found there were a bunch of other
friends, and they all signed the petition.
Jack ran. This big two-inch-high typed headline, “Doctors Revolt,” in
the Examiner, and that headline spread through the country. We ran this
whole committee, and for several months our life was getting this petition
signed, getting more people to support Medicare.
Ultimately, Bob went to Washington with our petitions and brought
them to Lee Bamberger, who was then working for the AFL-CIO, and she
was running the Medicare thing. She took them to Congress, and those
petitions were crucial in proving to Congress that doctors were not opposed
as the AMA said. The AMA did not speak for the doctors. It was all over
the country, and we got Medicare.
What we did was a very, very important part of the game, and it all
started because Bob Mishell made that phone cal. He was a great guy. He
became a professor at Berkeley and an immunologist. He had a medical

153

degree and he had a medical residency, but he really liked basic science
more, as did Henry Wortis, who was working in Hal’s lab at the same time.
It was a really interesting place.
Kiefer: Well, I want to thank you so much. Certainly if you think of anything else
that we have not discussed that you feel is important to the story, let me
know.
Herzenberg: [02:35:01] I’ll think about it. I’m glad I thought of the Medicare. [laughs]
Kiefer: Yes.
Herzenberg: [02:35:06] It was important. It really was important.
Kiefer: It is, and I want to thank you.
