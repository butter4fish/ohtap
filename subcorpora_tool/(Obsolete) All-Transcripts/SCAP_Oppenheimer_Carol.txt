SCHNEIDER: 	Do you have any thoughts on that?  As a president -

OPPENHEIMER:	I didn’t have good feelings and I don’t — this is almost more visceral.  But I somehow remember that the, what were told — there were con— there were some people loved him, as I recall and I remember that, that maybe this wasn’t him.  But that many people, one of the sort of cultural sort of norms was, you went to Smith to learn gracious living and to be an interesting wife for your husband.  And actually I think, at the very freshman orientation, at Sage Hall, Betty Friedan spoke and it was a powerful speech.  I was like, Whoa, that’s really cool and then we went back to our houses and talked about it and there was, there were absolute clear splits between people that said, “Right on, sister, that’s great and what a vision”  And other people who said, “Oh, she’s — that’s really not where I’m at.  I feel like I want to, I am going to Smith to find a husband and to learn enough to be an interesting wife for a husband.

SCHNEIDER:	So tell me about social life a little bit.  So you lived in Hubbard House.  Do you remember your house mother?

OPPENHEIMER:	I do.  She was great.  Mrs. Sholty.  She was old.  (laughs) And I think she died while I was still at Smith.  I think — I went away my junior year and I think she died when I was away.  I just remember she was old and somewhat frail, but she was wonderful.  She was very warm.  She was just a lovely person.

SCHNEIDER: 	And there were a lot of rules back in the day.

OPPENHEIMER:	Yeah.

SCHNEIDER:	Did you ever break any?

OPPENHEIMER:	Oh.  I’m sure we broke many, many rules.  One rule that I — (laughs) I was teasing somebody recently about this was, we had to learn the rules of gracious living, so what we had to do, this was I think on Saturday afternoon, we had to hold a teacup, which, or like a demitasse cup, and hold it and then sit down with perfect posture, without putting our hand on the floor as we sat down.  So we had to just cross our legs; I think I could still do this.  And then go down to the floor with the demitasse cup.  So that wasn’t a breaking of the rule, but that was a kind of rule that we had.  And then we had to — we served meals.
So we had to serve from the right, I think, and get off, you know, pick up on the left.  And we certainly broke curfew rules and — I don’t remember huge — there were rules that we broke.  Including, I mean, one, this is a rule that we didn’t break, but ended up being imposed in the first year that I was at Smith, was that there — a friend that I had known through a summer camp was a senior and she was, it turned out she was a lesbian and she was in a relationship with another woman at Smith.  They were in the fourth floor at Hubbard and they got kicked out and (clears throat) people were very, very — most people in the house were very upset, but no one talked about it.  They were there one day and they were gone the next.
And part of sort of one of my feelings of discomfort about that was that no one talked about it.  And that seemed so wrong.  I mean here, this was a woman that was full of life, with her partner and that A, they were kicked out and that no one said anything.  They’re just disa— you know, just they were gone.

SCHNEIDER: 	So when we were talking earlier you mentioned that you were very politically involved.  So that was you taking your chances.  (unclear)

OPPENHEIMER:	Yeah.  I would say my first year — I was, I loved Smith because of the learning.  I — we were talking about this driving up for the reunion.  Just sitting in the library, deep in books, having basically Monday through Friday just to really think and go to lectures and study and it seems a little nerdy these days and there weren’t lots of extracurricular activities and the ones that existed in those years were generally just not exciting.  Like now there’s so many things that people can do.  So I just feel like I was so blessed to have at least three years, because my junior year, which I spent in Geneva, was not that year.  That was totally out in the world and experiencing so many things.  But I loved the time here of quiet and being in the stacks.  I want to go see Neilson [Library] before it’s shut down.  And thinking a lot and I loved having that.
Politically, the first year I did get, there was something called the Northern Student Movement, so there was this SNCC in the South, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the South, but there was the beginning of — it wasn’t, at that time, it had not been taken over by African American students, so it was still an integrated kind of movement and I volunteered and once a week I recall going to Springfield [Massachusetts] and doing tutoring in a very poor area of, of Springfield.
But what I couldn’t remember and if you said to me or asked me, Well, who are your friends that you went down to Springfield with?  I have no memory of anybody, so even though we sort of took these isolated actions, I don’t, it wasn’t like I went to law school, I was very active politically in law school and I went to graduate school.  I was active there.  There were no groups like that, that first year.
So the Northern Student Movement was one thing and then I continued to play guitar here, so folk songs and protest songs and played with other people.  We sang those songs.  We’re sort of Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Odetta, just all kinds of folk music, but that wasn’t really political.  But the first year I’d say the Northern Student Movement was, was pretty much that it and I never, I always frankly saw student government as just lame.  (laughs) I don’t know how else to say it, like who cares?  Why would I bother with that?  So, yeah.

SCHNEIDER: 	Do you remember a lot of political conversation around Vietnam while you were here?

OPPENHEIMER:	Yeah, but not — there were some — I was, you know, I’ve been thinking about this because 50 years and I’ve never been back to a reunion, so — and in part, because — it didn’t beckon me back.  It didn’t feel like a place I would feel comfortable being back at.
Vietnam really didn’t start for me until I got back from Geneva in ’66 to ’67 and then I was involved with SDS [Students for a Democratic Society].  But there was a — I don’t remember a SDS chapter at Smith and I — and what I was remembering (laughs) and I was saying to my husband before I came, in the fall of ’66, definitely the fall because we were, it was apple picking — we, I went north of, near Gre— no, somewhere north of here, Greenfield [Massachusetts]?  Maybe no — to do, help organize Haitian apple pickers who were here on a special agricultural visa and I was like, who did I do that with?
Because — then it dawned on me that there was a chapter, an SDS chapter at Amherst [College] then.  And so I think there were no Smithies.  I don’t remember any other Smithies and I went with that group up to, I don’t know what we did — it was probably not too useful.  But we were up there picking apples and talking to the Haitian workers and maybe talking to them about working conditions and housing conditions.  But that was, that had an influence on me because my career became basically organizing, community organizing and I was a union lawyer and a professor law to union activists and leaders.  I was busy.  That’s been my life until maybe the last 10 years where it’s been more grass roots level politics.  So — but I — it was — but the Vietnam — I know I did go down in the (unclear) — Dominican Republic?  	(laughs) We went down — something happened.  We went down to Washington [D.C.] on a bus, I remember, and I don’t think it was Vietnam in ’67, because that was the fall of ’67.  But the spring, there was some protest in, I don’t, I think it was the Dominican Republic — it had just came to my mind.  I have to go and check that out.  But yeah, and that came in part by having been in Europe in — I was in Geneva and became a government major and was interested in international relations from having spent that year and then of course, the war became bigger.  But even — but most of my time at Smith was focused on labor issues and local issues.
We tried to organize a maid’s union at Hubbard House and that was my senior year and that was (laughs) very — that didn’t go over so well.  That was bad.  And not bad for me — I felt like I was totally righteous in doing that, but that really sort of became a line drawer.  People are like, are you crazy?  What are you doing that for?  I said, Look at the maids.  Look at how they’re having to work and the way we treat them and lack of and — I became basically a union, you know, lawyer for particularly for low-wage workers and that was kind of — that really showed sort of some, for me at least, part of the colors of Smith.
And this is a long divergence from [Thomas Corwin] Mendenhall, but I will go back and say and I was, (laughs) before this interview I was talking to a friend that’s going to be interviewed and I’m like, I wonder how truthful I should be?  And I said, well, I’m, why not?  So — but I always felt like Mendenhall and I don’t have direct knowledge of it, but — I do want to talk about Vietnam but I — that he sort of was a liberal in not a good sense of the word.  That he was too tolerant of things that he should have taken stronger stance on.  And that he covered for a lot of stuff that shouldn’t have been covered for.  So that’s my feeling.  But I don’t know, that’s way, ah, 50 years ago.
I will say that the war issue became very big right at graduation and I was very involved with that and I wore the white armband and I was very blessed to have parents that were proud of me for that and they’re one of my friends in the house, her parents were so angry at her they wouldn’t let her sit with them at graduation and my parents said, Come and — I’m not going to give the name, but, You come and sit with us; we’re proud of what you’re doing.  And there were two groups.
There was — I just read this in the book.  There were I think 638 graduates and 160 wore armbands, but there was a smaller group and I was in that smaller group, that turned their back on [Nicholas] Katzenbach when he was speaking and that was, that took some, a little bit of guts.  That was a little bit of a courageous move.  I mean, not courageous in the, in the broader world, but you know, it was, at that time that was, seemed courageous.

SCHNEIDER: 	Do you remember the reaction of other Smith students?

OPPENHEIMER:	Yeah, they were, again, I mean, I had already done the Haitian apple pickers and the maids’ union, but this was worse because it was with a much broader community and it was very public and the parents were there.  And what I don’t recall, which is something over time, I’ve been so grateful for my life that it’s really hard to protest if you’re by yourself.  It’s really hard.  And that’s, I feel blessed that I’m 71 and that I’m still very, very active in politics and in local organizing around issues like minimum wage and immigrant rights, as well as some electoral work.  But that one of the things that I’ve been blessed with is a community of people over these years that have provided support to me emotionally and me to them, for doing this work.
And one of the great things I feel that I’ve reached an age where I can help mentor younger people and give them, maybe not the support of a peer group, but at least the perspective of being older and sort of saying, Hey, you know, we know what this is about.

SCHNEIDER: 	So looking back at your time at Smith and looking at the institution now, do you see any (unclear)?

OPPENHEIMER:	Well, one thing I love and one reason I have to say this — I have three children, 33, 43 and 45.  My youngest is straight and married and has been for five years.  My older two children are gay.  My daughter and my son and have been married, as my youngest said, Longer than they have been.  No, they have been married longer than he is and he was happy that he didn’t get married until they were.  So one beautiful thing on this campus is all the women walking around holding hands.  And that never happened and it’s very moving to me as a mother because our kids, you know, we supported them coming out, but they didn’t always get support in the broader world, so that’s very beautiful for me to see that and that maybe, if that’s all Smith does, that’s terrific.  That’s plenty fine.
But I do, I see, we talked, sustain — climate change, sustainability — I love seeing all the Black Lives Matter signs up.  I do think it’s a bubble here.  It’s small, it’s not part of a larger — well, it is part of a larger world; we’re all part of a larger world.  But I’m happy to see those changes and I think that I would say that at Smith, it’s a far more intentional institution about trying to think about its role as an educator of young people in a bigger world and that was not really the way it was when I was here.

SCHNEIDER: 	All right.  Just to package this all up, what have you been doing since Smith?  And do you feel like Smith has helped you achieve what you’ve achieved in your life?  Or how has Smith affected you in your life?

OPPENHEIMER:	Well, I have to say that I basically chose to consider Smith irrelevant to my life for many, many years and if anything, I suppose — felt that it was not, it was not supportive of the way I wanted to be in the world, in terms of class issues, in terms of knocking down economic inequality, not being particularly sensitive to civil rights.  Good on women’s issues, but more on privileged women, as opposed to other people of color and — but you know, the role of Smith in terms of lesbian/transgender/gay rights has been wonderful to see.
I guess — I think I have a great love for learning from Smith and I think that had I not gone here I wouldn’t have — I love to read.  I love looking — my daughter’s an artist, so I love art, I love music and having had this kind of boot camp isolation from a bigger world, to have developed those skills and sense of confidence and being able to tackle big books and hard books and complicated literature and not science — never did that so well.  But politics, history, that came from Smith.
And now 50 years later I think I’m a little mellower than I was even 10 years ago.  Right?  And I feel very wonderfully grateful that I’ve come to a point in my life where I’ve reconnected with friends from 50 years ago who I haven’t seen and that I’m open, more open to difference.  That wasn’t necessarily because of Smith, but I’m happy that I’m able to appreciate more of that than before.

GEIS: 	(unclear) So you have a very, very good (unclear) you’ve been really, really brave.  Could you talk about any moments in your life when you feel like you’ve had to teach yourself courage and how you’ve passed that onto (unclear).

OPPENHEIMER:	Yeah.  We’ve talking about that.  Because we have a very close friend that’s a political leader in a small world, but it’s a big world and the whole idea of courage and my youngest son, who’s a lawyer and is working in Washington now, doing wonderful work, resisting — he was also, when he was growing up, a ski racer.  And so he’d go down these hills like 80 mph and he had a best friend who, they were always almost a second apart, but James was always better than our Sam.  And he used to say, you know, he, James doesn’t have courage because he’s never afraid.  I’m scared shitless every time I get to the top of the hill and go down.  And I think having a sense of humor about — one thing from that little story is just having a sense of humor about yourself and what you really do in the world and the other is to just, certainly what I would, I don’t know what, why I have this, but I always tell the kids, take risks, you know.
Do your best.  Take the risks.  Don’t look back and have regrets because — and that I see too much and that’s disappointing, sad to me that I always say, you only have one life and you’re either going to live it big or you’re going to live it really small and you’re going to be sad and disappointed and I think, Josh, our middle, may have taken that a little bit beyond where I was comfortable.  Luckily didn’t tell us about those risks until they were past and he was out of danger, but I think, you know, we have one life, I feel, I don’t believe there’s probably much going on after life, so take, you know, don’t look back and have regrets.  Try to do big things and surround — and the other thing about courage is acknowledge you’re afraid and what I just said, surround yourself and find a community of people that share your values and your ability to sort of take those risks, because you can’t really, don’t, nobody does those things alone and certainly Josh was there, but he had a team of very close friends and companions that all helped to do his work and that’s true.
My daughter’s a very amazing artist and does, she does work the intersection of art and engineering and that’s risk, because that’s like shifting the paradigm and it’s all about risk, but you know, life is really thrilling and wonderful and I just don’t want to wake up any day, be bored or feel like I regret having done some of the things I’ve been able to do.  And Smith, in many ways, must have given me a place to start to do that.

SCHNEIDER: 	(unclear)

OPPENHEIMER:	Well, that went so fast.  I had such a good time.  You guys are better interview–
