Speaker 1: Okay we're gonna start with your family background.  Would you tell me your mother's name, where and when she was born, and a bit about her?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother is Charlotte Carter [Charlotte Carter Burnett].  Her maiden name is Charlotte Carter.  She was born on February 19.  I will not say what year because she would come back and stab me.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And she was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: And tell me about her and her family growing up.
Speaker 2: So my--her father and mother is my grandfather is Azel Carter.  He was from Virginia.  And my grandmother Alee Carter [Alee Hunt Carter].  So imagine how--I don't know how Azel and Alee met.  She was also from Virginia and my--they moved to Pittsburgh.  And my grandmother was a--worked at a hospital in Pittsburgh as a nurse, a nutritionist in the nutrition department, right the food department.  They might have told me it was nutrition, said the food department.  And my grandfather drove a jitney cab in Pittsburgh and ran the numbers too (laughter) so and we lived in the Hill District--they lived in the Hill District of Pittsburgh.  She had two, a brother and a sister who--my uncle has passed away but my aunt still lives in Chicago [Illinois].  And so she grew up in Pittsburgh and that's where she met my father who actually played for the Steelers [Pittsburgh Steelers]--
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: --in the early '60s [1960s] when he moved from--he graduated from Oregon State or Oregon [University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon]; he was an Oregon Duck and then moved to Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: What's your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Leonard Burnett, Sr. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 2: --Leonard Burnett, Sr. and yep.
Speaker 1: So do you know why your mother's parents moved from Virginia to Pittsburgh?
Speaker 2: I think they had relatives and then there was just opportunity, you know, at the time Pittsburgh was a thriving city, said they were from--I pause because it's not the exact place in Virginia, but you know it was moving up north, there was a lot more opportunities and so and they had some relatives so it was the right place to be.
Speaker 1: How far back can your, can you trace your mother's family?
Speaker 2: I can go back to really just one generation sort of before that.  My mom speaks of her great-grandmother and which I'm not gonna remember the name this second, but she speaks of her who was just as she was beautifully jet black with you know straight black hair.  You know I guess that's the Indian [Native American] side of the family.  And so she just speaks about that and so--and so that's about as far back as I can go.
Speaker 1: And what is your--where did your mother go to school?
Speaker 2: My mother went to school in, high school at Schenley [Schenley High School], which is a big high school in Pittsburgh and then she went to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for college.
Speaker 1: And what did she study?
Speaker 2: She--education.  And she actually lived in New York [New York] for a hot second on the Hudson [Hudson River] and taught and then moved back to Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: What did she teach?
Speaker 2: Children grade school, grade school.  And then in Pittsburgh she went on to become a social worker and worked for the juvenile court system so yeah, she did that for, for years.
Story_ID: 656843
Speaker 1: Tell me about your dad [Leonard Burnett, Sr.].
Speaker 2: So my dad was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, on August 29, 19--he just turned seventy-five so '39 [1939], is that about right?  Probably somewhere around there--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and he and his family moved to San Diego [California] from Corpus, again for a job opportunity work.  My grandfather [Booker Burnett] worked at, at an airport aviation center and my grandmother [Andrea Hawkins Burnett] I think worked in retail for a while in San Diego and so they, they moved there when he was early on in, in his childhood he had four or five other sisters, he was the only boy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so he lived in San Diego, central San Diego.
Speaker 1: And how did he get to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: So after high school my dad went on to play football for University of Oregon [Eugene, Oregon], the Ducks, and he ran track and you know played football as well.  Actually ran track for one of the gentlemen that actually that helped start Nike [Nike, Inc.].  He's the one who came up with the waffle shoe.  So he ran track for him and I think Bowman [sic. Bill Bowerman] and then he got drafted by the Steelers [Pittsburgh Steelers] right out of college.  And moved--you know drove cross country, moved to Pittsburgh and was the only rookie to start.  Then he got hurt early in his career.  Now would have been a simple, you know, quick knee surgery that'd open `em up and yeah you got train tracks up his leg and so he, he played like two years and, but that's when he met my mother [Charlotte Carter Burnett] and--
Speaker 1: So when did--when was he playing football?
Speaker 2: He played '61 [1961] to '62 [1962], '63 [1963]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then he went from the Steelers after he got hurt, to the Browns [Cleveland Browns] and that's sort of where we--how we ended up from Pittsburgh, he ended up in Pittsburgh--from Pittsburgh into Cleveland [Ohio].  That's where they moved--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Cleveland.
Speaker 1: So he met your mom while he was with the Steelers--
Speaker 2: Played football for the Steelers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know the story of their meeting?
Speaker 2: Well, he, they were introduced by my dad's teammate this guy Big Daddy Lipscomb [Gene Lipscomb], you know, that was the name of the player then.  They were introduced and, and they had a little courtship and I won't go into all the detail 'cause my mother would kill me again, but you know, here I am (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And are--how--are they married?
Speaker 2: Still married.  They been married it's fifty years last year--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --fifty--we celebrated their fiftieth anniversary last year, and somewhere--they live in Orlando, Florida now.  So we, we--I'm a Midwest guy.  We went from, I went from Cleveland to Pittsburgh and then to Detroit [Michigan] and then they moved from Detroit in the '90s [1990s], early '90s [1990s] to, to Orlando, Florida, and that's where they reside today.
Story_ID: 656844
Speaker 1: So you moved from Cleveland [Ohio] to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --why, why did that move occur (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, so, my dad [Leonard Burnett, Sr.] after his football career at a certain point he partnered with my play uncle Brady Keys [Brady Keys, Jr.] and they, Brady had started a franchise called All Pro Fried Chicken.  And that was based in, in Cleveland.  And they had stores in Cleveland and, and throughout the Midwest and Southern California.  And then in the--they moved to Pittsburgh to open up more stores and that's where sort of they, the business sort of blossomed.  So he did that.  And he also had a company he, they worked with called Urban Talent Development [Urban Talent Development, Inc.] where they, they helped men that there coming out of prison find jobs.  So that was sort of the start of my father's entrepreneur career, his entrepreneur career and so that's what led us from you know Cleveland to, to Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: So you're--after your father and after his football career ended, that his, his work became entrepreneurial?
Speaker 2: Well for a minute he taught, he taught school, sold shoes, and, and then, then there--was--worked for the government as some sort of official for a second.  But he, you know, in his heart want to start his own business and Mr. Rooney [Art Rooney] who owns the Steelers [Pittsburgh Steelers] helped fund Brady and my dad for their first you know franchises and stores and that's, so they got started that way.
Speaker 1: And were they successful?
Speaker 2: Well those, so All Pro Fried Chicken eventually would--I think in the early '70s [1970s] there's a recession and went out of business.  But you know resilient as they are, they, they then went on to franchise Burger Kings and KFCs [Kentucky Fried Chicken; KFC Corporation] and so that's what actually got us to, eventually to Detroit [Michigan] where we opened up and started franchising Burger Kings and KFCs in Detroit.
Story_ID: 656845
Speaker 1: So let's go back to your childhood home.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your, your childhood.  What is your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory is living on Menlo Boulevard [sic. Menlo Road] in, in, in, in Shaker [Shaker Heights, Ohio].  And we had a--it was a two family home.  We lived on the bottom you know area, bottom floor.  It was you know I have two younger brothers, only--at the (unclear) in Cleveland [Ohio] there was this--my brother Todd [Todd Burnett] who is born, my brother Brandon [Brandon Burnett] was born in, in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  And it was, it was a beautiful time.  You know it was, it was you had little bunk beds and birthday parties and remember you know just the, my dad [Leonard Burnett, Sr.], you know just you, you know playing catch, being active and then with my mom [Charlotte Carter Burnett] always making sure I was overly dressed (laughter) you know and, but this is really fun times and memories.  It was a lot of fun and lot of friends on that block you, you know too.  You know I don't keep up with today but you know from Mikey Webb [ph.] and Sydney and-- Lewis [ph.] and Penny Lewis [ph.].  I used--we used to always play there.  You know Halloweens, Christmas, Christmas so, so just a lot of fun times.
Story_ID: 656846
Speaker 1: When you put yourself in your home and in your neighborhood, what are the sights, sounds and smells that you remember from that time?
Speaker 2: You know believe or not in Cleveland [Ohio], you know I just remember a lot of green grass, the sidewalks, riding our bikes up and down the sidewalks.  You know the, the scent that I always sort of makes me nostalgic for a host of reasons is spring.  You know that smell of the grass, just you know, winter is over and, and you just sort of warmth comes and smell that and that sort of went on with me and you know because I played baseball so spring is that, that time of year you always remember.  And just the idea you know riding bikes, you know playing catch you know there's a town square in Shaker, Cleveland that we used to go to so those were just some of the, you know, the thoughts.
Speaker 1: Was--who, who lived in the neighborhood?  What was the racial composition, what kinds of jobs did people have?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was predominantly but not exclusively black--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --they, the, the, you know it was sort of a mixture I think in that time in, in the '60s [1960s] a lot of folks were either teaching, in retail, you know a lot of stay at home moms as well.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: There were some people that were you know within the community service whether it was in the church and, or council people, those sorts of things.  But you know where I went to school again predominately, but not exclusively, black you know Tiny Tots was my first little, you know, first school.  I went to Moreland grade school [Moreland Elementary School, Shaker Heights, Ohio] where Mrs. Green [ph.] was my, my teacher.  I remember that.  And, but I think it was, it was a middle class you know--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --Shaker Heights [Ohio] is a, you know well known a sort of, of upperly mobile affluent community at that time it was, wasn't all the way there like that--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --but it was a very nice neighborhood and with good people.
Story_ID: 656847
Speaker 1: You mentioned your mom [Charlotte Carter Burnett] had you overly dressed.  Where did the, this dress experience come from?  Wha- where, where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, yeah, I, I don't know why, you know but she, she dressed her son up.  I mean I was the kid with the bowtie on and the sport coat and you know couple different suits.  You know I remember, you know going--to school in a sport coat when you didn't have to wear a sport coat so you know that was sort of I guess you know, she put that out there and had, had me always dressed snappy (laughter) so yeah--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --I think she probably wanted a daughter she could really dress up like it but she had me so she hook me up.
Speaker 1: Did, did she dress all three of you like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know I was her first so yeah she you know she went overboard with me I'm sure.
Speaker 1: What did you like to do as a child?
Speaker 2: So I loved, loved sports you know basketball and baseball in particular.  Believe it or not my dad [Leonard Burnett, Sr.] did not let me play football growing up until I got to high school [Shrine of the Little Flower High School; Shrine Catholic High School, Royal Oak, Michigan] which turned out to be a good thing.  But I, you know, this silly stuff from you know tag, and hide and seek and all that, but baseball was a sport I gravitated to that I started playing when I was six and played all the way through, you know partially through college.
Speaker 1: Do you know why your dad didn't let you play?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think he thought and it, it turned out to be true like, he was like that you know I'd get sort of tired of it and that you know as a, as a kid there was such a you know all of my--most of my friends, quite a few of my friends played you know, Pop Warner [Pop Warner Little Scholars, Inc.] and all that, and my cousins in particular, they did too and all but one of them didn't play in high school.  So I started at--actually it was one year probably my seventh, in seventh or eighth grade [at Sacred Heart Elementary School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] he said, "Okay you can play."  And I was running down the steps excited you know literally tryouts or practice was that afternoon and I stubbed my toe against the couch so I couldn't go so that was that and that never happened.  And then I didn't play again until I went to high school and actually oddly enough after my freshman year of playing I sort of told my dad, I was like, "You know I don't want to play anymore," and he was like, "You ain't quitting so you know you're in it now," and I played you know throughout my high school career.  So.
Story_ID: 656848
Speaker 1: What was young Len [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.] like as a student?
Speaker 2: I was okay.  You know sort of, you know my mom and dad [Charlotte Carter Burnett and Leonard Burnett, Sr.] where dad, where both of them had some stint in education, you know, they're the parents that would--so I'd write my homework.  I didn't have neat handwriting and then you know see I got one thing wrong on a particular line, they'd red ink the whole lines, I have to erase it and I'd start all over again.  I was, I--you know I was just average.  I, I, I can't say that I was you know overly hard working and studying but I knew what I needed to do to make sure I got decent grades and good grades.  So, (background noise) but it--there wasn't an, a, I wasn't a slouch by any stretch but I wasn't like the brainiac of school by any--at any stretch either so.
Speaker 1: Good.  What as a boy what did you envision you would do when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Oh everything from you know being a fireman to you know doctor.  I think for the most part going through up through college in my head somehow I, you know going to be a freshmen [at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] I, I thought about being a lawyer.  That's what I sort of had in my head, until I really got to college and realized how much you had to read (laughter) to become a lawyer so that quickly faded.  But then that really, but in my heart having grown up you know and seeing my dad have his business, I knew that one day I was gonna have my own business.  I really thought that you know as when I, actually after I got in my sophomore and junior year, I thought that I was going to go run the family business after I got out of school.  And I paid for this great education and someday I would just step in to you know take over at some point, but that was not the case.  So and my, my dad made sure he knew, that I knew that that was not going to happen you know.  So he, he made sure he told me that one day I sort of asked 'em when he was gonna let me--when I was gonna you know, was gonna teach me the family business, start teaching me the business and he said, "So why would I do that?"  And I said, "Well you know I'm your son, you know, junior on top of that, I'm, I'm the guy, right?  You know I'm, I'm anointed."  And he was like, "Well first of all it's not a, a family business, it's my business and, and we're going to sell my business one day.  I'm a make some money so I think you need to go figure out what yo business is gonna be and get to getting.  But don't look, don't look to come back home and do that."  So I was actually really upset for a--I moped around the house where mom yelled at me for moping around the house.  I was like you know, I've been--that was my whole game.  I was like I was gonna run the business you know I, I, I'm just inherit this whole thing.  Not the case.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So but it was great.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you had that conversation?
Speaker 2: That was my junior year in college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: That was when you were really making plans.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah or at least that, you know thought I was.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, you know I, I had a game plan.  That's what I was telling the girls I was dating, I'm your man, you know I'm, I'm set, you know.  Hang with me.  Yeah that wasn't the case so.
Story_ID: 656849
Speaker 1: So going back you went to; you said you went to Moreland grade school [Moreland Elementary School, Shaker Heights, Ohio] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went--Moreland grade school.  I was in Shaker [Shaker Heights, Ohio] and then we moved in second grade or for third grade I moved to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  So that's, that's when I got to Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Where did you live in Pittsburgh?
Speaker 2: We lived in Point Breeze [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], which is right next to Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] you know sort of a little small suburb of Pittsburgh, McPherson Boulevard, and so moved there in, in, in a nice home.  It would, would--seemed as we were growing up it was a big backyard--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --that's when I've since gone back there years and years and years ago.  And it was like wow this is so small we used to play kickball you know and we kicked over the fence it was a home run and you know it was, it seem like it was so far.  Again I went back and said wow this is like nothing--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --so that's where I grew up and went to for elementary school went to Sterrett [Sterrett School; Sterrett Classical Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] which is up the block from the house a little bit for a year for third grade and then, my parents [Charlotte Carter Burnett and Leonard Burnett, Sr.] moved me to a Catholic school called Carlow College [Carlow College Campus School; The Campus School of Carlow University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], a campus school for from you know fourth grade through sixth grade.
Speaker 1: So, so what was that experience like for you moving around a lot as a child?  You were young when you moved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know I, I, yeah,--
Speaker 1: --moved in schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't sense it as moving around a lot, I mean at that time in retro- when I look back at it and again it didn't seem that there were good stages of my life I mean really in second and third grade just sort of don't remember much anyways, but I was, I was in Pittsburgh from third grade to eighth grade--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so and you know went to grade school at Carlow and I went to another Catholic school for junior high [Sacred Heart Elementary School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and then moved to Detroit [Michigan] for high school [Shrine of the Little Flower High School; Shrine Catholic High School, Royal Oak, Michigan].  So it definitely was a, you know I knew I was making a whole set of new friends but it was also sort of that break in life the right time to just sort of enter into you know high school and things like that.  And, and I, and, and we'll go through my life there's--there are very distinct stages when things have happened and I look at it as a plus.  It's for you know, I, I know a lot of people you know it's, I get sort of laughed at because I can be speaking to someone--and I'll ask `em where they're from and you know oddly enough they're either from Cleveland [Ohio] or Pittsburgh, or Detroit or Ann Arbor [Michigan], Tallahassee [Florida], Chicago [Illinois]--you know I been to all these, Baltimore [Maryland] so I have something to relate to somebody and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and I sort of look at that, I never thought of it as a burden, as more of a, just a great life experience.
Story_ID: 656850
Speaker 1: So in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], you--the, this suburban area where you grew up, what was the racial composition of your neighborhood [Point Breeze, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Again predominantly but not exclusively black.  You know, there were, you know it literally were next to an area called Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] which is exclusively black, it was a nice, again, middle class neighborhood good people you lots of kids you know some were ages of me and my brothers [Todd Burnett and Brandon Burnett] you know lots of running up and down between houses and backyards and you know a, a time that you know unfortunately you know living in Harlem [New York, New York], my children [Leonard Burnett III and Rani Burnett], I can't always say literally you just go outside and when them lights come on come back inside--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and that was that you know and so, but so, it was fun time.
Speaker 1: In--you moved to Detroit [Michigan] at what, it was, that was for high school [Shrine of the Little Flower High School; Shrine Catholic High School, Royal Oak, Michigan] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For high school so I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: And what was Detroit like at that time?
Speaker 2: Detroit, it was, it was popping.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean it was a, a thriving city, the automotive industry was doing well.  You know it, it was a, a very distinct middle class, upper middle class African American community.  You know they were cool.  I mean it was, were--Pittsburgh was a very you know similar people all the way around and very certain kind of people I think really at my core makes me who I am and then Detroit just sort of added all the sizzle and the coolness that they had.  You know and open my eyes to the real world.  I mean so again Pittsburgh again I was sort of insulated and from--when I was young and anyhow it was just nice, nice neighborhoods and things like that.  And certainly being in Detroit you know you had great suburbs and good schools and the public schools you had good kids, you had bad kids, you had gangs, you know and you were just more exposed and sort of, sort of gave me another sort of sense, set of senses that I was able to use throughout life and but appreciate you know so there were, there's been real, real fond memories.
Story_ID: 656851
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned Catholic school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you go to Catholic school in, in Detroit [Michigan] as well?
Speaker 2: Yep.  I went to Royal Oak [Michigan] Shrine of the Little Flower High School [Shrine Catholic High School].  Not Catholic, I'm Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you know I think the, you know, my parents [Charlotte Carter Burnett and Leonard Burnett, Sr.], you know wanted me to go to a private or Catholic school you know for, went to, went public school [Sterrett School; Sterrett Classical Academy] for a semester actually for a year when I was in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and they were teaching to read all sorts of different ways and phonetically and all that and they were like, this is not gonna work.  So, so I, so I was in Catholic school which you know I know--I think it gave me a, a you know a, a sense again I'm, I'm, I have a great deal of faith. I won't say I'm not a holy roller, overly religious, but having that religious sort of base in the Catholic school gives you a perspective and understanding and also as a young man you know as a little boy there is always that sense of fear like I'm a--did (laughter) I do something wrong, (laughter) is some, there's gonna be consequences right and so but it was a, a great you know diverse group of kids and you know an interesting time.
Speaker 1: Would you, you say, when you mention that you're Baptist.  Did you grow up active in the church?
Speaker 2: I grew up active in that my mom made me go to church every Sunday just about you know and so I would go with her every Sunday.  Then as I got older and you know could, you know, go out on Saturday night, you know, I'd go out and you know maybe come home a little late and she'd knock on that door say, "Hey you know time to go to church."  And said, "If you can hang at night you can certainly get up and go to church," and so I, so I wasn't you know I didn't often get up on my own to go but she made sure we (background noise) went at least every Sunday.
Speaker 1: Were you on the choir?  Were you involved in any other activities?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no just you know bible school--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and stuff like that, you know, but nothing, no I wasn't the choir boy or anything.
Story_ID: 656852
Speaker 1: How would you describe Len [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.] the child? What was your personality?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not too different probably than it is now, just very happy guy, positive, lots of friends, always smiling, you know I, I just really have a--had a I think a very positive, sort of outlook on life and the possibilities you know, enjoyed you know running around and playing you know could get in a little trouble every now and then you know but you know I asked my mom [Charlotte Carter Burnett] 'cause now I have two children [Leonard Burnett III and Rani Burnett] of my own I said, "What kind of kid was I," especially when they're acting bad.  I said, "Am I getting payback?"  She said, "You, you a good kid you know."  You--I was emotional sometimes you know definitely I was a don't--didn't you know wasn't a kid, a kid that fought but if you pushed me enough I'd, I'd fight back you know after getting teary eyed and you know and then they finally asked okay, you know but I--but, but the real, you know, fun, positive and, and I think it had a real good energy.
Speaker 1: And you have two brothers.  What are their names?
Speaker 2: My brother--my middle brother's name is Todd Carter Burnett [Todd Burnett] and my youngest brother is Brandon Tyler Burnett [Brandon Burnett].
Speaker 1: And what are the age differences?
Speaker 2: We're all four years apart.
Speaker 1: So how were you as a big brother to them?
Speaker 2: I think I was great.  You know I was a great big brother.  You know but, you know we were, we, we--it's funny we, we--yes we're all four years apart.  We did, we did a lot together particularly when we were younger and living in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and we moved to what, that's where my youngest brother Brandon was born and then you know we all played sports, my brother Tyler was pretty athletic and we moved to, to Detroit [Michigan] you know, you know we were sort of I was in high school [Shrine of the Little Flower High School; Shrine Catholic High School, Royal Oak, Michigan] he was in grade school and so we were always together but we all had different activities and things like that.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: So, but we had close knit family you know.   We'd fight sometimes you know, and you know I was just tease, my middle brother Todd he was the one that you know would get the--he got the first punch in, you know, and I'd get caught with the second one you know.  And, but, you know overall you know it was a good time.
Story_ID: 656853
Speaker 1: So you went to high school [Shrine of the Little Flower High School; Shrine Catholic High School] in Detroit [sic. Royal Oak, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and it's coming time to go to college, did you always know that you would go to college?  Was that just--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --understood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh that, that was never an option or a doubt.  It wasn't even a conversation.  You know I think that you know it was just where was I going to go?  You know.  Again, I was a decent student.  I, I you know played sports.  I had visions of playing bas- baseball in college.  I was a pretty good baseball player in high school.  Had actually--did get a opportunity to go play at some smaller schools but in my head, I you know always thought I was gonna go to school at either Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.], USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] or Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] was also in my head.  Those were the schools I sort of wan- 'cause I wanted to move away from home.  That was you know.  I was ready to fly away from the nest.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so it came time and actually I, I you know as it got closer to making a decision you know the idea of moving away from home was not as fly as I thought it was gonna be.  But you know when--what I wanted not be too far away.  And I played baseball.  I had applied to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and the, the head coach, baseball coach at Michigan saw me play in a, in a, in a playoff game and I did extremely well.  I mean you know something crazy you know, you know went six for seven, threw two guys out at the late the whole bit and after the game, he was like hey, heard you--I actually had gotten accepted to go to Michigan and they have a summer bridge program so that was for the kids that they need to acclimate into college so--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --so that's where I got in under.  And he said, "Well you should you know try out for the team."  I'm like bet, I'm a, I'm gonna play for the University of Michigan.  I mean I've never got cut from anything you know I'm, I'm a great baseball player.  So I'm a go here and you know walk on the team.  And so I decided to go to University of Michigan, started that summer of '82 [1982] and then eventually went to try out when they had baseball try outs and got cut (laughter) didn't even you know, didn't even see Bud Middaugh.  That was just, they just had you run and throw.  And so I wasn't exceptionally fast and didn't have a great (unclear)--I was--I had a good arm, but I got cut.  But, so that was my first actual time ever getting cut from anything. But went to University of Michigan, which was a great experience.  And stayed there for two years actually.
Story_ID: 656854
Speaker 1: And then, then I transferred to Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 2: Now what, why did you transfer?
Speaker 1: So Michigan was a great time, right?  I, I pledged at Michigan, pledged Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] in spring of '83 [1983].  Had a lot of great friends and but I had applied to the undergraduate business school.  So at that point I sort of--again after I got in college and saw the thick books.  I said, well I don't wanna be a lawyer any more so let's do business--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know.  And, and then, of course, I was gonna go run my dad's business so I need to learn and you know so I can go back and teach them all the things, the new things that they would--didn't know.  So I was gonna go to, so I was going to business school at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] at which you don't get into until your junior year of college.  So I applied and you know again, a first, they sent me a note back saying hey we're not gonna let you, not--you're denied entry for this semester, reapply again next year and you, you, maybe you'll get in, right.  And so I was like well ain't this a--I come to Michigan, I got cut from the baseball team a couple of times.  I don't get into the business school and I--so in my head I said okay I'll either reapply or I'll you know, I'm gonna get a bachelor of general studies degree which meant you didn't have to take a foreign language 'cause I took one semester of Spanish in, in college and that was like you know Spanish was worse than Greek.  It was like (unclear), and so, I didn't know.  And so I was like okay I can't do two semesters, I'll be in college forever.  So, the first thing I did is I told my dad [Leonard Burnett, Sr.] that I was going to, I was gonna transfer schools.  I had a friend that went to Florida A and M and that I was gonna go transfer there.  My dad who went to you know again University of Oregon [Eugene, Oregon], and was like, "Why would you transfer from the University of Michigan to a historical black college [HBCU], Florida A and M?  That makes no sense to me."  And then, you know on the other side of the coin my mother [Charlotte Carter Burnett] who went to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] was dying for me to go a black college, if only for a semester.  She said you need to get the black college experience for a semester.  And in my head coming out of high school [Shrine of the Little Flower High School; Shrine Catholic High School, Royal Oak, Michigan], you know so you know my counselor you know I told 'em about Michigan, I told `em about other schools I wanted to go to but you know if you didn't go to one of the tops schools, the next level school was like the community college.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know the, the idea of a black college didn't even come up in a conversation so in my head a black college was all the kids who couldn't get in the good schools. I mean that was--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --you know that's where they went you know `cause--and so anyway so my dad I (unclear)--someone who I said that, loves to read.  He'll research anything.  He was one of the smartest people that I know.  He went to the library believe it or not back then and was reading about Florida A and M and he mentioned someone else.  As it turns out one of his friends knew a professor down there.  Told him about the business school and my dad was like, "Oh this is where you need to go."  So I come home from work one summer afternoon and my mom says, "Hey, Lenny [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.], guess where you're going to school next year?"  You know I'm, I'm going to University of Michigan.  Like you know, like you know that's like.  She's like, "No you can go to Florida A and M." I'm like, "I'm not going to Florida A and M.  You know I was just kidding.  Like why would I transfer--I'm not transferring in--I'm going my junior year, I'm a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], I'm, you know this is a good time, I'm just gonna go back."  And she says, "No you're gonna go to Florida A and M."  So dad comes home and he says, "Hey look, here's all the reasons you should go.  Why don't we just go check it out, you know.  There's nothing wrong with just flying down there and just you know taking a tour."  I said okay cool.  So we do--but I say, "Dad it's, it's a bad, it's, it's country, it's country down there."  He said, "No, no, Tallahassee is the capital of Florida.  It's a, you know thriving metropolis."  So we fly into Albany, Georgia, where they had, my dad and uncle [Brady Keys, Jr.] had restaurants down there KFCs [Kentucky Fried Chicken; KFC Corporation].  We drive from Albany, Georgia, into Tallahassee, Florida, which is like a back roads to Thomasville [Georgia].  You know it was like okay this is not where--a kid from Detroit [Michigan] is supposed to be.  So he's telling me it's the capital of Florida, you know it's all sorts of things going on there.  And what I didn't really realize at that time was Florida A and M meant Agricultural and Mechanical University.  So there's the agricu- so we pull up and the, the main part of the campus and there are cows and horses and all sorts of stuff on the--and I'm looking at my dad I'm like oh no, no, no this is not happening and so we sort of got a laugh because he was telling me how hot, you know how you know where the city, you know it was, and I'm like dad this is, is a farm, you know.  And so we go do the tour and it's a--I mean a great sales job.  I mean the, the kids that walked me through they're bright, you know, the--lot of talk about internships, all sorts of fun things.  So we, we get back on the plane home and so my dad's like, "So what do you think?"  I said, "Yeah it was nice."  I mean it was really, it was really cool, you know I mean, but I--you know said, "Well, would you transfer?"  And I said, "Nah no I don't think so.  No."  He said, "Well why wouldn't you transfer?"  "Well you know I, I just don't think it's a place for me."  He said, "Well what are you gonna do with Michigan?"  You know I said, "I'm gonna get a B.G.S. degree."  And that's what you would get if you didn't take the foreign language.  He says, "Well I want you to look in the paper and see if they have, if they're looking for people with a B.G.S. degree in the paper."  And I was like, "Yeah I'll figure that out you know," you know.  He says, "Well I tell you what.  You go to Michigan next semester and you start paying for your education or you transfer to Florida A and M and I'll keep paying.  Think about that."  So I was like well daddy ain't raise no fool so I was like, all right, I guess I'm going to Florida A and M.  And so that's how I got there.  Which was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Story_ID: 656855
Speaker 1: And so transferred August of '84 [1984] and it was hot.  I don't think I wore a pair of long pants for two months.  It was ninety some odd degrees at twelve midnight, one o'clock in the morning you know and something around that, it was hot, just hot.  That big old you know I, I call them roaches but they were flying kind of, kind of the bugs they called them but they you know they look like big roaches to me.  They flew around the cam- you know it was--but it was, it was a great for a whole host of reasons.  One, I had never gone to an all black school.  I was typically the you know one of few black kids in and around the class whatever, had this perception of being you know the (air quotes) best black kid because I was the only black kid (laughter) in, in there so whether it was in baseball you know, we you know, and, and so I get down here and these kids are brilliant.  I mean the brightest of the brightest.  Funny thing you know me having come from Michigan, you know, when you see any black person on campus you give them the brother nod.  You know like you know, you know like we're here together, fighting this you know making our way through.  Well I get down at FAM [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] I'm just gonna give 'em the brother nod to people.  I'm you know nodding, and the cats was like I don't know you, why you waving (laughter) at me but, but it was, it was great.  I mean it was the, the experience was great.  The professors were great, really taught me a lot about myself.  It was the first time I was really that far away from home.  And again it, you know to--a couple quick stories you know I, I transfer there, I think I'm the big bad guy who came from a Big Ten [Big Ten Conference], University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] school to come down here in Tallahassee [Florida] at Florida A and M so obviously I've gotta be one of the smartest kids there you know.  Where the first test I had was a, a management, in management.  It was a multiple choice test.  Forty questions.  I, I halfway studied you know whatever.  I had just multiple choice and the test, the test came back and the teacher was like okay so `cause the curve, the low score is seventeen, the highest score is thirty-seven.  So I'm sitting in the back of the class with a buddy of mine that actually transferred with me from Michigan, John Simpson [John David Simpson].  And I'm sitting back there what dummy got a seventeen on a multiple choice test.  I mean how does that happen, you know?  And they hand out the test scores.  Brown, Burnett [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.], seventeen.  (Laughter) I was like ooh.  And my boys were like, "What you get, what you get."  "Oh I got twenty-eight.  I got twenty-eight."  (Laughter) And woke me up, you know and really just you know studied, you know did a lot of group friends, John, I also met [HistoryMaker] Keith Clinkscales, Greg Healey [ph.], Randy Brooks [ph.], a whole bunch of us that, we, we played hard but we worked hard and we studied.  We sort of competed against each other.  So graduated with honors barely, but I got there with honors and it was just a great, great, great experience.
Story_ID: 656856
Speaker 1: How would you say that FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] affected your identify?
Speaker 2: I think in a lot, well the--for my identity you know I am who I am.  I would have been that way I think regardless.  But it certainly just totally broadened my perspective of the world.  I mean you know prior to that, the world began and ended in Detroit [Michigan].  You couldn't tell me differently.  You know, I mean Detroit was it.  And you know you, I, I went to Florida A and M and you see people, I met people from New York [New York], from Chicago [Illinois] from L.A. [Los Angeles, California], from Texas meet people from all across the country.  And, and so, so there's that, just so that there's just much more broader sense of what the you know and then in perspective not even that broad but just was broader than what I was raised to be.  Because we didn't travel a lot outside you know, I, I didn't get a passport until I was a, a I think I was twenty, twenty-seven.  So I hadn't been out the country other than Tijuana [Mexico] or Canada you know prior to that.  And then, and it also gave--you know again I was never, I don't want people to think I sort of grew up not knowing who I was as a black man.  You know that, that did not, you know that I thought I you know was--you know I was in Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] and all that but I was, you know I knew I was a young black man.  But being at a historically black college [HBCU], it gave you another level of pride and sense and, and just, just a deeper understanding about who you are as a person and who you, you, you're, your culture is and their influence.  And that you know and how much you know just how important, you know another level of, of self, of knowing self.  I think it, it added to that.  Met you know lifetime friends.  Got a phenomenal education at the school of business industry [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University School of Business and Industry, Tallahassee, Florida].  Dean Mobley [Sybil C. Mobley] was our dean there.  And, you know, did, did two internships you know different parts of the country--
Speaker 1: What were they?
Speaker 2: --one was in Denver.  Well I, I shouldn't say that. I did one internship in Denver, Colorado, with U.S. Home Corporation.  And the other I worked for IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] in Tallahassee [Florida].  Made good money.  That was the best money I ever made (laughter). It was no taxes, making like you know eight dollars an hour in Tallahassee, I was rich.  And, but it was just really you know, it, it sort of, I understand, understood and understand now more than ever what my mom [Charlotte Carter Burnett] meant about getting the black college experience and so.
Story_ID: 656857
Speaker 1: You mentioned Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], so in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --your, during your formative years, you--at what age did you join Jack and Jill (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was when I was in, was in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  So that was in, I don't know what grade I was in, but it was in grade school at some point.
Speaker 1: How long were you involved?
Speaker 2: Through high school [Shrine of the Little Flower High School; Shrine Catholic High School, Royal Oak, Michigan], through high school so.
Speaker 1: What, what did you benefit from that experience?
Speaker 2: And again more than anything well particularly in, after Detroit [Michigan], you know, just lifelong friends, you know.  But then, then experiences of just you know whether at different events you know and, and, `cause I think people have a, can have a warped different sense of what that organization means.  And in every chapter is different for sure.  I was in the Detroit Chapter [Detroit Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc., Detroit, Michigan] so it was definitely a, we're a different type of chapter, a lot of fun 'cause we had great parties, good people.  But you know these are people that you--that I met, and people that I would connect through other chapters that again are lifelong friends.  You know--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and so when I went to college there were folks, there were from another chapter so that I reconnect with and, it's almost like a fraternity.  And so, it's, I think it for me was much less about all the, the probably the negative connotations you hear about and I think our family sort of participated in that way that was really about hey you know I went to a predominately white high school or, and grade school, you know lived in, you know, lived in the suburbs of Detroit.  You know we moved into an area called Southfield [Michigan] which was predominately a, a, Jewish neighborhood, we're one of the first or second black families to move out there.  And you know wanted to make sure you kept grounded--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --know in some way.  So, so it, it was all fun, you know.  Never took it too seriously.
Speaker 1: Well, Jack and Jill, as you mentioned, many people joined because their parents wanted to make sure that the children know other black--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --children.  So you've described that network and then the network at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], how do you think that those networks have affected you as you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I think, in fairness--to be honest with you the, the Jack and Jill when I grew up for me was more like a, I, 'cause I used to go to boys club and all that kinds of, but it was sort of like, sort of not hang out time but you, you go around with your friends to these meetings you know hanging out and doing different projects some socially and things like that.  It was, it was a community experience and a good networking but I didn't look at networking. It was like these are friends--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --I'm sort of hanging out with and you get to, you do parties together, you do holiday events and stuff like that.  So it was sort of the, the, just a way of having, another aspect of having fun. At, at, when I went to Florida A and M, it was really a, a, a, broader swath of all sorts of people that (unclear) and, and where I, what I was taught by my parents [Charlotte Carter Burnett and Leonard Burnett, Sr.], there's good in everybody.  There's something right.  Not only just good in terms of whether the person is good or bad person, but you can learn and, or you just, when you're listening and know people just you learn different things about life from, from them.  And so there were all sorts of people from all walks of life that at FAM that again gave me that broader perspective of, of life you know.  Of you know cats that were Jacksonville, J-ville, Florida or you know Miami [Florida] you know.  And I didn't know anyone from New York from Queen, Queens and Manhattan and Harlem [New York, New York], the Bronx. Then you get the kids that were from you know Texas.  Some of the cats from L.A. [Los Angeles, California], you know it was just like a whole different group experience.  Some were you know, some came from middle class families, some were not so you know weren't, didn't come from much.  But they all had something to, that I could pick and learn from.  And, and be friends with or not.  It be on like this 'cause but, but I learned it from, I didn't learn from anybody.  And I can glean something about life from anybody that you know I used you know to, to sort of as a, a way of observing and at some point you know it's, it's good to have that knowledge.  So that's the way I looked at it.
Story_ID: 656858
Speaker 1: So you describe yourself as an average student and you had the wakeup call (laughter) to become a better student--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], interestingly--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --enough.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did your, did your drive to be a better student have, talk about that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about how that shifted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure I think it's, it's I think at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] it was about just graduating.  I mean it really--I mean it was like you know and we had, I had good friends.  I had fraternity brothers [in Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] and I, we were good.  It was like hey you got in and let's make sure we get out.  And you know you're in the class with hundreds of people right--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --in a huge auditorium and so there was a, it was a little bit of a, like yeah as a, as a group, it was more and more individual lives at Michigan.  Again I had boys and good friends and girlfriends stuff like that but it was like hey I'm just focused.  You know or not (laughter).  Just trying to get through it.  At FAM was--it was a lot more of a community right.  And, and there was a, a you know the teachers knew who you were, knew your name and you'd see them after class sometimes and you be, and so there was a, there's a connection that whether you knew it or not that made you want to do a little bit better like you could really get called out.  It's one thing to flunk out of a class and not do well in a class that has four hundred kids in it.  They don't know you but as, as a number.  It's another thing to not do--it another thing to get a seventeen on a multiple choice test and you gotta walk past the teachers and says, "Len [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.], what the heck was you doing," you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then on top of it you know since I had my crew of boys that you know, most of them were fraternity brothers and others weren't but we, we ran hard.  I mean it was--so that I transferred schools.  I'm at a black college [HBCU].  All these pretty black women and I, you know, I, I, we went hard.  And they partied you know.  And, but the--you know each of these kids had goals you know.  Make sure you got good grades.  The good jobs came to kids who had good grades.  And so my crew of guys we, you know, we studied hard and was a little bit competition between us you know--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and so that again that, the more, the, the smaller campus the more close knit that you were.  And also a little bit of maturity--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --you know it was like okay, you know, you, you want the great job, you better get, you know get some decent grades.  And you know I didn't wanna be the guy that didn't make honors amongst the rest of my boys--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know like Clink [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] you know he was he was you know cum laude or something crazy you know.  J.D. [John David Simpson] was you know summa [summa cum laude] whatever.  I was you know thank you lawdy.  But I got, and I got magna [magna cum laude], whatever it was that first one [sic.].  You know when you want that, you know you had pride.  You know what you want yeah you wanted, you didn't wanna be that guy that wasn't getting good grades.
Story_ID: 656859
Speaker 1: You pledged Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was your father [Leonard Burnett, Sr.] in a sorority?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: Excuse me a fraternity? No (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Why did you choose Kappa?
Speaker 2: So, so my, my parents at that time well my father's never pledged.  My mother [Charlotte Carter Burnett] has since become a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] in grad chap- in alumni chapter.  But my uncle was a Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  And when I again went to Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] again had no real connection or thoughts about pledging other than my uncle but the idea of pledging to me seemed to be really sort of for guys you must have real self, low self-esteem problems.  Like you, you but you know or maybe that's the way you think you're gonna get girls and things like that.  And of course, I didn't need any of that you know so I wasn't you know why do that?  I'm me, find me.  And the truth of the matter is--so a couple of things, so when my uncle said hey, he's a Alpha, he was a Alpha.  He said, "Look, pledge Alpha. I'll you know help fund you through and you know, know you should be an Alpha."  And so I go to Michigan and the first party I go to one of the first parties I go to it was a Que [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] party.  And these Que start stepping to you know 'Atomic Dog' or something crazy and I was like you know this is hot.  These cats look at them.  This is great you know and I said oh maybe I'll be a Que you know and, then as it you know when the semester rolled around and they start having their smokers, me and my, my boy J.D. [John David Simpson] we decided we were gonna go to a couple of smokers and so we went to the Que one.  And I was like I, I'm not gonna do that.  Then, we went to--I did also go to a Kappa party and they were cool.  I thought they, they were kind of fly right.  And then I went to the Alpha one.  And it wasn't for me.  And I went to the Kappa smoker and I was like okay these guys are cool but I still wasn't sure.  And then, they, we went through the, the smoker and a couple of meetings and they explained to me the pledging process and I was oh this is great I'm definitely gonna become a Kappa.  But, what they said in the, in that meeting wasn't exactly how it all went down.  That's all I'm gonna say.  But I'm a Kappa and proud to be a Kappa.  So.
Speaker 1: Now the, the Kappas have a reputation for partying hard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: And so you described that as part of your experience but was it also true that, that you would, and your friend group the Kappas were studying as well?
Speaker 2: Well, no, it's now at Michigan it was a little different.  You know so again, I, I again I told you it was, if you're in big, big classes it's just really about just let me just get through it.  And you know what was interesting now people, I partied there so people think you go to a black college [HBCU] that's where, you know.  We had some parties.  But see at, at Michigan, they don't care what you do.  Like you're literally you know, as a, as a school.  When I say don't care I mean that you know like you're truly you don't know many of the teachers.  They're not you know--they, and so you, you stay out as late as you want, you go to whose ever dorm you want.  You do, you know, you're on your own.  At FAM [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] you're grown up but they--there were rules that you weren't gonna be in some girls dormitory.  You weren't gonna be roaming the campus you know.  This part of campus this late at night.  You know there were rules and you had to abide by those rules.  So I partied harder at Michigan.  I had a lot of fun at FAM but the, there was much more going on at Michigan unattended than there was at Florida A and M.  So, but my crew, one of my boys went off what I was saying my frat brother but he transferred with me--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --John, to FAM so we're sort of in it together.
Story_ID: 656860
Speaker 1: So sometimes people describe historically black colleges [HBCUs] as places where you're, you learn, especially for men, you learn how to be a man--
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that there, there is sometimes even classes--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for that.  What was the environment like at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] for you in that context?
Speaker 2: You know, honestly it well, I think it, so for me as becoming a man that I won't say that that was what was you know, wasn't anything anti-that.  But I think that the idea of all the things that I knew that a man was supposed to do I really learned from my father [Leonard Burnett, Sr.].  Because that's what I knew from the basics of you know, you know opening the door for a, a lady to just, just, to you know the way you treat a woman.  As I saw how my father treated my mother [Charlotte Carter Burnett].  But as a, I think as, a as a black man, you know you, you sort of, you're just the, there's a pride a, a, the idea of knowing your history, being in the school of business [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University School of Business and Industry, Tallahassee, Florida] the, you know the, the idea of being prepared you know as a person.  And you know where, where, where people felt that students, black students fell short when they were in Corporate America.  Wasn't on the book sense you know but is on the other things that came along with that you know not knowing The Wall Street Journal, not knowing how to act at a--how a board--Robert's Rules of Order how you know when you're at a dinner you know what the place settings, how things go.  It's all those sorts of things.  And that's sort of you know that aspect of attending the business school, that's--those were things that I sort of learned and I think added to my foundation what my mother and father had taught me about being, not just a man, but a good person. And so there were all those life experiences that I think were additive to making me who I am today.
Story_ID: 656861
Speaker 1: Now you described in your junior year which would have been the first year at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that your father [Leonard Burnett, Sr.] told you, no you're not going to come back--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --graduate, and be in the family business.  What happened for you then?
Speaker 2: So, after I moped for a while, I think well you know I always knew well at that point that I moved from wanting to run that business to always wanna have my own business.  I don't what--when that's gonna actually happen.  What that's gonna be in.  Is that franchising or whatever, but that was the end goal, right.  But also felt I wanted to get a job out of school too for the same reason you know learn as much as I could about Corporate America, take those experiences and then apply those to my business whenever that came around.  And so, you know what I got out of school, I got a job.  Well let me back up so I did an internship at U.S. Home corporations, corporation [U.S. Home Corporation].  I was a, I worked in the human resources department.  And so prior to that, my idea of a good job was having a nice office with a nice desk, an assistant.   You know making some good money.  I wanted to be that guy.  And one of the careers that never crossed my mind was the idea of sales.  'Cause to me a sales guy was you know door to door vacuum cleaner or car sales guy, plaid suit, you know, not that guy, I'm not that guy.  I'm the corner office desk guy.  So I did a internship at U.S. Home and I worked in the human resources department and we, I had to do, I had to a sort of survey where I interviewed these, their salespeople.  And their salespeople so I knew how much money they made, I got to meet them and all kind of stuff.  And these guys dressed fly and they made a lot of money at selling homes.  I'm like whoa you know so I said I think I wanna do sales you know.  And then as I start talking to them and seeing what their personalities were like and things like that and how I engage I was like I could, I could do sales.  I think 'cause I wanna do sales.  And so my dad of course had been saying you should probably do sales and you can make some money doing sales.  So I come back.  I do an intern at IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] in the sales area and then eventually interview with you know what it was it was American Hospital Supply [American Hospital Supply Corporation].  They then got bought or they did a merger with Baxter Healthcare [Baxter Healthcare Corporation].  A long story short I became a sales rep selling hospital supplies for Baxter Healthcare.
Story_ID: 656862
Speaker 1: So you went to Baxter--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Healthcare [Baxter Healthcare Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And why there?
Speaker 2: When, so when I got out of school [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] I had a couple different offers but Baxter it, it, it, there's one from Baxter; there's one from an insurance company.  But they, what was keen to me is I wanted to start really selling.  And so Baxter had a short training program and really allowed you to start selling.  And they paid at that time commensurately a, a good salary, you know.  Well, it wasn't the highest so when I got out of school, the salaries would range from you know like 19.5 to the, the home run's if you making thirty thousand dollars a year--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that was a great salary in '86 [1986] you know starting salary.  Mine was I think 23.5. And you know I was like okay that's a good salary and I could start selling and making commissions.  So that's how I knew--'cause I knew those guys from U.S. Home Corporation all their money was from commissions.  I said, how quickly can I start making commissions?  And so chose Baxter, was a great company you know, all the benefits you could imagine, you know the stock options, 401(k), you know, health benefits all that kind of good stuff.  And so that's why I chose Baxter.
Speaker 1: And how long did you work there?
Speaker 2: I worked for Baxter for three and a half years.  So my plan was, as life has it.  You know it was--my plan was to work for, for a company for five years and I was gonna start my own business.  Again, not knowing what that was.  As life as it, so I went to Chicago [Illinois] to train.  And so I, I was there for about two months and then they based you, and then they deploy you to a particular part of the country.  And so I was interviewed and was taking a position in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And the guy that sort of ran the whole region, the eastern region, said, "Hey, love to have you out here.  It's, It's a 99.9 percent chance you'll be Philadelphia.  So go get your stuff, head back this way."  I was coming back to New Jersey for some more training and, "You're gonna be in Philadelphia."  So I go home, get my stuff, I'm headed back to New York and I get a call and that my, my boss says, "Hey Len, remember that .1 percent?"  And I said, "Yeah."  And he said, "How would you like to be in New York City [New York, New York]?"  I'm like New York?  I'm like okay, cool.  You know like hey, who gets--and I only been in New York once.  Thought it was crazy.  You know I came there with a friend of mine I was dating.  Was too expensive, too fast, too dirty and I just don't know how people, like why would anyone live in Manhattan [New York], live in New York period.  But I'm like hey, I'm, I'm you know twenty-two, you know I'm not gonna be here forever.  Couple years.  Breakout.  Good experience.  And so I came to New York and the first thing was the, the, the human resources person there said, "Hey you're gonna love New York.  There's a lot of culture, you know, nightlife, museums, you know, Broadway.  And but the only thing is when it's time to go you're not gonna wanna leave."  So I looked at her and I was like, "Lady if you tell me it's time to go tomorrow, I'll be good.  Like this is just a quick pit stop you know.  I'm gonna enjoy it. But this is not where Len Burnett's [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.] life story is going to you know really you know be, be a big part of it."  And so short--well so as that happened and as it turns out [HistoryMaker] Keith Clinkscales who was--who went to school with me as well, he out of all our buddies, he also moved to New York.  He actually lived in New Jersey and was working for a bank.  And so, we get a--we end up you know getting an, a, apartment together on the Upper East Side [New York, New York].  Another buddy that went to school with us having a blast.  You know.  You know.  Everything that you know the culture but lots of night life.  You know three, you know, young guys in New York with a little bit of money having a ball.  And the--in about a year and a half later, I get a call from the company says, "Hey, so you know you've done a good job, we wanna--it's time for you to you know go into management.  We wanna move you to a managerial position," and I forget what part of the county it was, "and so, what do you think?"  I'm like, "Well, you know I think it sounds good, but I, I think--I really think I need a little more experience.  I'd love to you know do more and by the way can I manage, can I manage here where I--can I go from a sales position to managing the eastern area?"  "Well, no, no Len, we don't allow that. You gotta go to another part of the country and manage 'cause you, you know your, your peers--you don't wanna go into managing your peers right off the bat."
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And I'm like, "Okay, well let me get some more experience."  It's about you know six.  So in the meantime I'm, I'm doing great.  I'm getting all sorts of rewards, sales awards and then, then about six, seven months later they're like, "Hey Len, so think it's time, right?  You, you were gonna--."  I'm like, "Well you know I sort of like where I am and you sure I can't manage here, you know?"  And so what they did was I was the first person they ever let manage in the territory that they were selling in.  So I went on to become an eastern area sales manager and moved to Edison, New Jersey, which is fine.  So I went to Edison.  Keith went off to B school.  But in the meantime--
Speaker 1: At Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: At Harvard.
Story_ID: 656863
Speaker 1: And in the meantime, he and I were coming up with ideas you know over those years when we were roommates in New York [New York] to figure out what business we could start together.  We had both had this desire to become entrepreneurs, you know we'd say.  And during that time we were roommates.  You know desktop publishing; you know the first big Apple Macs [Macintosh computer] came out.  And we thought of all sorts of things to do.  The first thing we were doing, we were doing resumes for, for redesigning resumes for kids.  That was a big deal.  We were going resume books.  So the companies wanted resume books with binders and you know getting, sending those out to companies. We had a little (air quotes) consulting firm because of course we were SBI [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University School of Business and Industry, Tallahassee, Florida] graduates we could teach people about, and could help them with their businesses.  But then we sort of argue about to this day, but you know, my story is the correct story.  Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] came home from work.  He was in private banking and he said, "Hey let's, let's--we should go into media."  I'm like okay that sounds good.  And so we, he, he looked at buying, first buying the TV station.  You know it was like of course why not.  Right and we investigated that and you know went to our bank accounts, no money for a TV station.  Okay let's bring it down a notch.  How about a radio station?  You know investigated that, and certainly not in our bank account.  We went to actually talk to MESBICS [Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Companies] and all this kind of stuff and they were like you're too young to give money to, can't do that.  So as I mentioned desktop publishing was really coming into the fray and it allowed you to lay out and design a magazine on a computer as opposed to doing the old school way which was very time consuming and expensive.  And we had when we were at FAM [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] done a souvenir booklet for the fraternities.  We made the Scrollers [Scroller Pledge Club] go out, sell ads and we made a lot of money.  And Keith came home one day and said we should start a magazine.  I'm like okay bet.  He said I can lay out and design the book and I, you can writes well and I can, I'll sell the ads.  That's easy.  How hard is that?  It's like selling those you know, like the Scrollers sold the ads.  So we decided to start a magazine called Urban Profile.  It was, it was understanding the need and accepting the challenge.  That was our, our sort of motto.  It was, the mission was, was about social, political and economic histories from the young black perspective.  This was in 1988.
Speaker 2: And didn't Keith use it as his Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] project?
Speaker 1: So it, it was a case study.  This was an Urban Profile case study (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: He did it, we did it, they did a case study about Urban Profile which I'm not sure they still use it 'til this day, but there was a case study about you know the business raising money and just where, you know, just what the plan of action should be.  So it was a case study.  So that, that was pretty--
Speaker 2: Did that help you all in terms of learning?
Speaker 1: No I mean look you know, I'd, I'd be lying to--Keith, we did, we did everything that I would tell someone not to do, right.  But if we did it the way you're supposed to do, we would not, I wouldn't be doing this 'cause if you knew, if I really, if I had done a business plan, had I really done all the research about magazines and what it takes to do a magazine, had I talked to some other people in the magazine business, every arrow or every indicator would have been like do not do a magazine.  But of course, we're young, dumb and excited.  And you know we believe we can do anything.  We decide to start a magazine and we you know we--I remember you know the first ad that we sold to, to Revlon [Revlon, Inc.].  I remember getting ads from Coors [Coors Brewing Company].  And I, I remember--another ad we got.  So of course because we were coming from the perspective of the young black perspective and it was, it was launched during a time when and it's ironic how this goes is it was during the Tawana Brawley case, the Bernhard Goetz case.  And so every image to us that was shown on TV of black people did not represent who we were as young black men you know and college educated.  You know they're calling us buppies at the time.  And we sort of hated that word buppies because that meant that you were sort of you know rising up but forgetting where you came from.  Well that's not who we were.  You know.  And so we felt that we needed to represent that in what Urban Profile was about.  So part of that also was we weren't gonna take any liquor or tobacco ads because that's, of course, bad for the community.  And so I remember being the first call we got from someone who put a, a tobacco ad in the magazine you know for a lot of money.  It was like I wouldn't let go of that.  Get off that stance, take that money but you know 'cause we had to keep funding the business I mean.  But it was a, it was a great time and that, and that you know that's when hip hop was sort of really coming up, Chuck D, 'Fight the Power.'  That was sort of our mantra you know and we, really we, we were on a mission to not only start a business, but really to provide a perspective and slice of culture that wasn't represented in the magazines that were out there at that time.  You know and it's, it's funny how my friends would always say hey, is there enough black magazines.  You know there was Essence, Ebony, Black Enterprise, Jet, like that's enough, right, you know.  These are black people saying this and like and we're like no there needs to be this.  And so we did that.  And there's another friend of ours a Kay Lucas who again most of our friends were in media were like dummies don't do this.  Kay was like, "I'm a walk you through and tell you why you probably shouldn't do it, but if you're gonna do it, here's how it, here's how it goes.  Here's how the advertising goes."  That was really helpful.  And so he was very supportive and introduced us to other people and you know sort of helped us you know just understand the business.  The--you know they were learning on the fly.
Story_ID: 656864
Speaker 1: And you know it was so, so what happened was Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] went off to B school [business school] in I think '89 [1989] maybe and then that's when I took the, the promotion to work for Baxter [Baxter Healthcare Corporation] in management, but you know he and [HistoryMaker] Derek Ferguson who also went to B school with--who started the magazine [Urban Profile] with us at same time, at the time they were in B school together and we were doing the magazine while they were in school.  You know I was still sort of selling ads, they were doing the layouts, selling ads.  And so that's what we--they did, we did until he graduated which I think was in 1990.  And then we decided, had to decide what we were gonna do.  And funny story is my college sweetheart who I dated for many years, her and Keith were good friends, and so she asked Keith one day you know when he was about to get out of school and said, "Hey what are you gonna do now that you're about to graduate from Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts]?"  He says, "Oh you know Lenny [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.] and I are gonna you know go ahead and give this magazine business a, a good run."  And she says, "Okay, okay, but really what are you gonna do?"  (Laughter) And so, so yeah, so we said we were gonna go start the, the, the--go full time with the business.  So I left my job at Baxter.  Keith you know and Derek, we all moved to Baltimore, Maryland.  Lived off--
Speaker 2: Why Baltimore?
Speaker 1: So it was like, there were three cities we, four really I guess we thought about you know New York [New York], which we knew we couldn't afford to be in with no income.  Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which was sounded cool.  I sort of liked Philly.  D.C. [Washington, D.C.] though we thought D.C. was a little too far from New York and then there was Baltimore.  So we felt we need to somehow be close to the political scene and still have access to New York and money and so Baltimore was that, that place.  And it was a perfect place for us.  It was inexpensive.  I bought my first home you know in Baltimore where I didn't have a full time job with a buddy of mine, Bob Ingram [Robert Ingram], who I still work with 'til this day.  So we moved down there.  Had a little office on Calvert Street and we hustled it up.  You know weren't--I was living off my 401(k); Keith was living off whatever money he had saved.  Derek, was--we're all just sort of hustling and, and so we.
Speaker 2: And Derek at this point is already married [to Regina Bullock Ferguson], isn't he?
Speaker 1: Derek is--I don't think he'd gotten married yet, either got married or got married while we were there and, you know we were out there.
Speaker 2: So wait you quit your job--
Speaker 1: Quit my job.
Speaker 2: --which now you're in a management position, you were making a lot of money.
Speaker 1: Oh I made good money.  And (unclear).  I made good money at the time.  Again my, my, one of the you know at the time I had a, I got a bonus check that was you know for you know a, not six figures, but it was you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well.
Speaker 1: --(unclear).  And I remember taking all my boys out to Smith and Wollensky's [Smith and Wollensky].  And you know so we were you know it was good money.  But again you remember having a conversation with my dad and my, and, and my uncle about you know really, they knew what we were trying to do and I was trying to convince my parents [Charlotte Carter Burnett and Leonard Burnett, Sr.], my dad and them to invest in the business and he was like I'm not doing a magazine business. That's swimming upstream as they would call it.  That's, that you know, that's a hard one my uncle and dad knew, knew, know Ed Lewis [HistoryMaker Edward Lewis].  And then we were around when he started Essence and they're like dude, this is not the business to be in.  But if that's what you're gonna do, you know God bless you and I think you should do it.  And so I kept talking to him--
Speaker 2: So he did not invest in your business?
Speaker 1: Nope.  Did not.  I think he might have given me an ad for a couple thousand bucks [dollars] one time but they, what you know my uncle I remember he said this this was summer we were down there at a barbecue or something and so he says, "Len, when you gonna do your own thing?  I remember this magazine you keep talking about doing it full time."  "So well I'm trying to raise the money and just wait for the right time."  He was like, "There's never gonna be a right time.  You know.  Don't think money's gonna fall in your lap and you got all this funding you know you just gotta, you really just have to go do it."  And he goes like, "Have you ever been bankrupt before?"  Well, I'm like, "Well nah."  He said, "Well look you don't have family, you don't have, you know go out and if that's what happens that's what happens.  But you gotta give it a shot."  And so we literally you know did that.  You know and so you know moved to Baltimore and you know we're doing our thing.  Eating you know little, I remember we had this little sandwich shop would go to get $1.50, $2 sandwiches with chips.  You know we make sure we got you know instead of eating out you always had you know, you know cold cuts and cheese and sodas and bread in the refrigerator.  You know, you know, Keith and Derek, I didn't do this 'cause I, don't think Derek did, but Keith did. Would go and, go to the--you could go to the loading docks and sort of get tapped to just help bring stuff off the ships.  Get some quick money that way.  And so that's what we, what we did.  And yeah and so we did that and then just as it was really getting extra tough, and, and my dad's gonna kill me, there's another gentlemen who is our editor in chief, I cannot remember his name at this second so, it's on the tip of my tongue but that's age.  But anyway so he--
Story_ID: 656865
Speaker 1: So Derek [HistoryMaker Derek Ferguson] gets married [to Regina Bullock Ferguson], had kids so he was like, "Look I gotta," so he took a job at Bain [Bain and Company].  Another buddy he got married, who was our editor in chief, he was like, "Hey guys you know."  And then as fate, faith and fate would have it; we get a call from another media company it was down there in Baltimore [Maryland] who wanted to (air quotes) buy us.  So technically what ended up happening is they bought our debt and we went to go work for Career Communications Group [Career Communications Group, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland], [HistoryMaker] Tyrone Taborn, did that deal.  And they had black engineers [U.S. Black Engineer and Information Technology], Hispanic engineer [Hispanic Engineer and Information Technology], professional magazine and so Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] was the president and I became account executive.  Made you know nineteen thousand dollars a year.  Everything, you know that was everything.  And we did Urban Profile and these are their magazines.  And so that's what we're doing and so I thought at that time you know that we'd still grow that business possibly, but it was a you know it was, it wasn't a perfect fit.  But I was in Baltimore.  It was you know, we, we're gonna figure out a way and maybe magazines wasn't gonna be my final you know media wasn't gonna be my final entrepreneur thing, but I'm doing it, you know.
Speaker 2: And around what time was this?
Speaker 1: This is in 1991, '91 [1991] and so we're just down there doing that, right and having a good time.
Speaker 2: And what was your circulation like at this point?
Speaker 1: What did we, how many magazines did we print or what are we saying that what our circulation was?  I, I think we're pricing at a hundred thousand circulation.  You know, you know we, we were doing business with you know with Pepsi [PepsiCo], you know Uptown Records.  That's where I met Brett Wright my business partner today originally there.  You know UniWorld [UniWorld Group, Inc.] you know Mr. Lewis [HistoryMaker Byron Lewis] and Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] and also they would give us ads but well you know we were chucking along.  Nothing special. I can't remember how much like our biggest--I, I can't imagine that we maybe, maybe fifty thousand [dollars] in ads was probably the biggest issue we might have had at that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --time.
Story_ID: 656866
Speaker 1: And so doing that and then Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] got a call from Time Inc.  They had--well back up. So Time Inc. had launched or did a test issue of this magazine called Vibe.  And Vibe in their first little test issue had more ads than we had ever had in any, in all our combined issues.  And so, but that sort of empowered us more.  You know it was like you know, you know whoever is doing Vibe you know uncle time, you know they, they go had fund (unclear) and you know do this and we're just out here doing our own thing and we will make it happen, you know.  We will just keep pushing, we're black owned, we're that.  And so Keith got a call from, from Time Inc. from a friend, Lynne McDaniel who is now a friend of ours.  And said hey, he said to him, "Hey if you notice Urban Profile--if you guys, what are you guys doing, you know?  Are you happy?"  Said, "Yeah, yeah," and you know, "Have you seen Vibe?"  "Yeah, yeah, we've, we've seen it.  It's cute you know."  "Well we want to launch it and we were thinking about you and Len [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.] maybe coming up and help launching the magazine."  And Keith's response was you know, "We all sort of both felt like okay that's, that's nice you know, but we're entrepreneurs, we're doing our own thing.  We have our own autonomy you know, this is what I'm doing."  "Okay well we're paying this much money."  It was like, "Oh we'll be there tomorrow," (laughter).  And so we, Keith went up in let's see, Keith went up in late '92 [1992] and I came down in February of '93 [1993] and just part of the team that launched the--
Speaker 2: And what was your role?
Speaker 1: I was the sales guy, I was account exec.  So Keith was the president and CEO.  I was account exec.  A gentleman by the name of John Rollins you know technically hired, he hired me and I sold music advertising and had all the black agencies 'cause you know I was you know I was the black guy so I got all the black agencies.  And, and so we were part of the team that launched Vibe.  And you know great environment, met all sorts of people you know that, but, but the big thing was I'm back in New York City [New York, New York].  I cannot believe I'm back in New York.  This was not what my life's plan was to be.  Keith and I got a little studio apartment in Hell's Kitchen [New York, New York] you know while we were trying to figure out where we were gonna live you know but we were never there, we'd be in the office all the time.  And we were you know all working hard trying to make this Vibe thing you know become a real business and a reality.  And so that's how we got back.
Story_ID: 656867
Speaker 1: So now the sales side of Vibe, well Vibe itself was a different model.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, the term urban--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --became popular through Vibe and made a lot of black media mad.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But in terms of the sales space because it was creating so called new market, what was the experience like for you when you were going out to sell for this new property?
Speaker 2: It was a mixed bag. So there were a, a group of people that were very excited and sort of got it and for the most part that include all the, the record industry people.  You know so they were all over it 'cause they, other than The Source, they really, they didn't have a place for it.  Things outside of just rap so that was big.  Then there were the black ad agencies, right.  Which for the most part was very much embraced because it allowed them for the first time to really play you know in a something what--there was no, wasn't such, it was very cool and hip and, and, and took them out of their, just the conversation of just being African American. And allowing them to show that the, their, their influence on culture, right.  And so it was new, it was fresh, it was urgent and so a lot of those agencies got it.  But then you know there were those that particularly on the general market side, that were like no, like why?  How?  Why is this important?  I mean why would I ever be here.  I mean, I, I covered some, so my territory was all the music, advertising, all the black ad agencies and then I also had Detroit [Michigan] 'cause I grew up in Detroit.  So they're like Len [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.], so you go call in Detroit.  And so I remember my first calls in Detroit you know, you know distinctly.  I remember, I can't remember her name but this woman who was over Ford [Ford Motor Company] and Ford Escort you know older white woman, but she was like, "Why would I ever run an ad in a magazine talked with hip hop?"  And, "Why, why would I do that?"  And she said it not in a, a, wasn't racist, it wasn't, it was just sort of like why?  Tell me why?  I don't get it.  Why would Ford Escort be in here?  You know?  Can they afford it?  Is this the right you know?  And she was no--not too different than most people at that.  I know quite a few people that time.  And so unless you were in music or had a direct correlation in music so there's fashion, you know Tommy Hilfiger was there.  Gap [Gap, Inc.] you know was in the beginning.  Levis [Levi Strauss and Company].  You know, of course, there was all the, the urban fashion Mecca, FUBU, you know those, them--Phat Farm.  Those businesses were there.  You know it, it wasn't, it wasn't easy sell and you know now the good news was the economy was so thriving that it was to, to get the business started, you know urban fashion, music, you know the black ad agencies and there were a few others like I said Tommy Hilfiger and others you know tobacco advertising at the time that were there to support and sustain the business.  And it took you know several years for these other businesses that were predominately run by general market agencies to get the fact that hey we're not selling you a black magazine, we're selling you a magazine about black culture or urban music more importantly, that is purchased predominantly by young white males.  So if you're trying to reach young, white males, you know, the, the most influential point in young adult is music.  That's, it's always been that way. So if you're trying to reach young men, young white men, and you want to get the, the most urgent, be part of the urgent touch point, most urgent touch point for them as a, as a consumer, that is music.  And the number one music to those young white men is hip hop and R and B.  So you can go to Spin magazine all you want but they're not, they're not you know alternative is not where the vast majority of these kids are buying the music.  And rock and roll same thing.  You know, we, we would not, these artists would not be multiplatinum selling artists unless young white men weren't buying their music and the dirty little secret in the beginning was that you know most rap music was purchased by young white men.  And so we use that story to, to sell the broader aspect of what Vibe was about.  And through a lot of hard work, through a great sales marketing team, great editorial by the various editors and chief, and our fashion stories were stories you didn't see.  That--we did, we did fashion, you know we did content on par with other general market titles.  You know we respected Ebony and Essence and Jet and Black Enterprise.  But we were shooting for another level of aesthetic that at that time they weren't delivering and that allowed us to eventually break into categories of advertising weren't being retained by those other businesses.  You know fashion advertising you know look; to this day you know I believe that Essence magazine should be getting way more fashion than they do and that's not their fault as much as it is again the, the bias and the short sightedness of these fashion brands.  But you know we had a, we invested in and hired great people that could tell that story.  And we were able to get you know Gucci and Armani and Versace and you know Dolce Gabbana [Dolce and Gabbana] you know the young lady Beverly Smith [HistoryMaker Bev Smith] who is, you know, a on air celebrity now she and a gentlemen Mark Eckstrom, those were people that really you know worked with us that, you know, that broke those categories.
Story_ID: 656868
Speaker 1: And so we you know it, it was a fun time.  You know it, it, it was great, and it's still great, it's almost like again a little fraternity of folks that were part of that in the beginning and you sort of always have that connection.  And it provided you know to this day you at that time, if you didn't work for you know the big three Ebony, Essence, Jet or Black Enterprise, you weren't really working in media as a writer or sales, sales certainly in marketing you know and Conde Nast and Time Inc. and these other places.  I mean there, there was some but there really weren't a lot.  And if you look at the tree of, of, of the people that blossomed out of that, and what they're doing, it provided a great platform for great writers and you know Scott Poulson-Bryant, Joan Morgan and [HistoryMaker] Emil Wilbekin, Danyel Smith a forum that they went on to become great writers for everybody--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --you know.  And so Kevin Powell you know so there's always people that worked with us from you know Kenard Gibbs [HistoryMaker Kenard E. Gibbs], Samantha Fennell, John Robinson [ph.] went on to Nelson Boyce to run businesses and major you know media companies.  And Vibe provided all that opportunity and it you know and all kudos you know go to of course you know [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones who really, it was his vision.  He knew exactly what he was trying to do and, and, and you know a gentlemen by that you know nothing (unclear).  Don Logan was there at Time Inc. and allowed it to at least sort of happen and you know Bob Miller, Robert Miller [Robert L. Miller] who, who sort of ran Time Inc. Ventures that you know went on to purchase Vibe back who I still work with and our partner to this day really had the wherewithal and the stick to it-iveness to allow it to, to grow and become a business.
Story_ID: 656869
Speaker 1: So I wanna talk about what was going on culturally in America during the time that Vibe began and really had an incredible assent.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What, you know, hip hop was just beginning.  What--can you describe what was happening?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So you know hip hop you know it was beginning to become, be put on the map.
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: You know 'cause it had, it had been there right, of course.  And then the, but, but there was a sense of empowerment that was coming about from not the, the music.  The music sort of drove everything, you know, culturally, politically, entrepreneur wise, fashion.  Technically, it did, it drove all that and so what was quickly becoming known is, and Vibe really helped propel this, is our influence on American culture.  We knew that, that the day was coming you know so we would talk.  We would sell the idea hey when you grow up you'll listen to first music we listened to was pop music, you know.  There are kids that were birthed around this time.  The first music they're gonna listen to and the first radio station was gonna be a hip hop station.  Their first athletes they're gonna fall in love with were black athletes basketball player.  The, the, you know, the, the you know Serena [Serena Williams], the best black; the best tennis players were, were black.  Golf champion [Tiger Woods] was black.  And all this stuff was sort of happening.  And was sort of turning America sort of upside down.  This is it.  And so what we knew at that time early on before we knew somehow was happening is that's where it was all going.  No matter how much you didn't agree with it or what you didn't want to happen.  What was going--what was happening was the browning of America not only from skin, but in terms of its aesthetic.  And--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and so you need--so the conversation was you can either jump in this conversation now and go for the ride or I'll see you later on down the road and it's gonna be a lot more expensive too, you know.  And, and don't, and hope that no one else comes in along the way and jumps over you because they, they embraced it rather than fought it.  And so, and so you know, and so everything was going on you know it's in the news.  So there, there was a vibrance in a, and again empowerment.  There were businesses being started in fashion or record labels being launched.  And there were movies and movie companies coming out that were you know producing you know, black producers of movies.  So obviously there was Spike Lee, but then you know the Hudlin brothers [HistoryMaker Reginald Hudlin and Warrington Hudlin], and you know, the, the whether it was just movies you know there, there were a plethora of movies were coming out that were about us and our culture and it start off very hip hop but then it grew into more of just our lifestyle, you know.  So it wasn't all about gang banging and rap and it was about love.  It was about family and all of our stories.  And so there was a movement and I think there was a, again because of the music there was a sense of again going back to the idea of entre- being an entrepreneur, people didn't feel that they had to go work for Corporate America.  There were other alternatives.  There were other things that were going on whether it was going to work for a fashion company that was targeting our audience or whether it was starting your own business.  I mean there was just a--there was a sense that you could do anything.  And that was an exciting time, you know.  And it, you know less to do about I think Vibe sort of told the stories but it's really the hip hop music and the culture that was making it happen.
Story_ID: 656870
Speaker 1: There was also a bit of backlash in the sense of well you mentioned you're selling the idea that young white males are buying this magazine.  On the flipside there was the question was is this really a black magazine?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and some challenged that.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: What was your experience?
Speaker 2: I mean there, it would come up.  You know on occasion.  And look it from a business standpoint it didn't matter much at that time.  It was occasionally asked.  But you know Quincy [HistoryMaker Quincy Jones] was a majority owner.  Time Inc. was involved but then the business was sold to Bob Miller [Robert L. Miller] and Quincy so.
Speaker 1: Why was it sold?
Speaker 2: So interestingly, interestingly enough so Vibe launched in 1993.  To this day we're probably the fastest launch in terms of profitability.  We became profitable after three and a half years.  What the model for Time Inc. at that time were big circ [circulation] books.  Big, I mean million wasn't quite saying a lot, but that's you know.  And our, at that time, you know Time Inc. didn't see how this business was gonna really get over you know a half million circ.  We did decently on the newsstands, terrible on sub [subscription] cards, you know our audience was quick to subscribe, slow if ever to pay.  So we had to implement you know, our letters would go out to, that would require your bill me letters would go out, ours were a little stronger than the typical ones.  You know 'cause we, we went from zero to sixty quick like you know whatever the law allowed us to say up until that point about what would happen to your credit and everything if you didn't pay.  We went to that, right to the tippy toe of that.  And so, but so we did, did well on the newsstands, oh excuse me, on advertising but the circulation story wasn't that, didn't sync up with what Time Inc. saw as a business would be successful.  And so they were gonna shut the business down.  They were gonna shut the business down.
Speaker 1: Now what circulation were you at, at this point?
Speaker 2: We launched at a hundred thousand and we grew to two hundred or two hundred fifty thousand, so that was year two, three, then our goal was probably like three hundred thousand or something like that.
Speaker 1: So it had grown substantially?
Speaker 2: Well substantially in for us again within the Time Inc. Venture's model, that wasn't big.  And so the stupid--everything was truly measured at that point in time by the circ story.  It was a circ story.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: So newsstands were okay.  Sub renewal--sub pay ups were not good.  And, but literally so Jonathan Van Meter was our first editor in chief and then Alan Light came in and it was right around when Alan came in and the, the conversation was well what, the, the debate that was going on within Vibe was what, what is hip hop and who are you really targeting?  If you're understanding that young white men are buying most of hip hop, do we need to cater the, the edit a little toward them as well that would often get into a--that may be cool to a young white guy, this, that definitely ain't fly to a young black kid.  Matter of fact that's, you're not keeping it real or you're not, you're, you're out of touch.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And so that was the, the, the, the give and take and back and forth we went through as a business and Jonathan who is a great editor, a great writer.  You know, his vision of hip hop was--'cause he loved hip hop too, was a little more downtown, you know.  And so it had a different visual and sometimes different articles and so it didn't sync up with what Quincy and even Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] felt that that's where it should be.  Alan, who, Light who's a music head, I mean he--so Jonathan was a cultural, cultured guy, you know.  And I'm not gonna say he didn't know music but Alan was a music editor so he, he became editor in chief and sort of grounded us back in the music as opposed to the culture.  And so right at the point where the conversations were like hey, we're gonna shut it down, a couple of things happened.  We had a--Alan--we had a, Alan--we had, I think we had Prince on the cover and we had, we had, we had famous cover with TLC in the firemen outfits after one of them [Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes] had you know torched their home.  And so we had that happen.  Huge newsstand results.  Sub cards started coming in quickly and pay up got good, and we were off to the races.  And we were doing, you know we literally I remember at an event with Quincy.  He was like, "Look man I think I wanna give us a couple more issues."
Story_ID: 656871
Speaker 1: And, and, but in the end, it still didn't fit within Time Inc.'s idea.  So we were profitable, but again, again profitability wasn't even the only key.  He says how big can you really be?  Are you gonna be as big as Entertainment Weekly, as People (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: That's--and that was from their perspective, not gonna happen.  And so--
Speaker 2: Was this around the same time that they were buying Essence?
Speaker 1: No, this was--
Speaker 2: A little earlier (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) well before that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was like '95 [1995], '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so then they sold the business to Bob Miller [Robert L. Miller] and Quincy [HistoryMaker Quincy Jones] and you know Bob raised money and we went on to buy Spin magazine and we had, had a business that was really targeting.  You had both sides of-- we were--if you want to reach young adult men, it's between Spin and Vibe.  We had the answer.  As opposed to Rolling Stone which was really you know your dad's magazine.  And so.
Speaker 2: Who moved with the publication after Bob and Quincy bought it?
Speaker 1: No everybody stayed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No one, no one left.  I mean it was as seamless for us as you know for our team it was just nothing changed.  It was just sort of.  Well, I'll tell you what changed.  Funny story is I was out at dinner so we, we had Amex cards [American Express Company] when we were at Time Inc. and you know you, you're--'cause I always thought you know there is no credit limit with your Amex card, right?  And so, we, we there's all sorts of stuff that we bought.  Nothing inappropriate but you know it was never--we weren't worried about the card not working.  Well, did the deals, switched over to a new co [company] with you know Bob and we still had our Amex card but guess what there are limits on (laughter) Amex cards.  So I never forget I'm out to dinner with some buddies and a female celebrity, that'll go nameless, that we all sort of you know somewhat trying to impress to you know who was attractive, and we're out to dinner.  I put down my card to pay, to pay for everybody, you know.  And the lady comes back (laughter) and the waitress said, "Excuse me sir, do you have different card?"  I'm like, "What do you mean?"  She said, "Well this one declined."  You know, I'm like, "Oh heck this Amex what do you mean it's declined," you know.  It's like oh no you guys are at your limit, you know.  Of all--'cause they're all tied together.  It was like you're at your limit.  So, so yeah, there's some differences for sure.  But everyone stayed.  It, it wasn't that, it was seamless you know for us.
Speaker 2: Were there any differences in terms of production budgets?
Speaker 1: No 'cause we had become profitable.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean yeah, we, we had become profitable.  We were, we were kicking butt.  I mean you know I, I think it was, it just all synced up at the right time.  Time Inc. was you know it's not gonna ever be big enough for us.  You know Bob understood the business.  He was passionate about it you know along with Quincy.  And so you know it was like hey it's good. So we were, we were at that--the '90s [1990s] were, were great times for us, you know.  Cover shoots were twenty-five thousand dollars.  You know, you know rep firms in Italy.  Going to Italy twice a year for the fashion shows with not only your editors, but you know a couple salespersons or two, your publisher--
Speaker 2: And celebrities too.
Speaker 1: --celeb, take celebrities over.  We took Tupac [Tupac Shakur] over, you know.  We, you know, and at all the trade shows you know.  We were the best in the biz, but we're making money.  And then went on to you know become--we always believed, Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] and I in particular, that you know Vibe was never to be just a magazine.  It was a brand.  So you know we did the Vibe Music Seminar.  Actually we were going to do a Vibe film festival at one point.  There was a television show.  Albeit not successful you know we had that.  So we always kept pushing the envelope you know to what Vibe was supposed to be.
Story_ID: 656872
Speaker 1: And what were your roles, you and Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] at this point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, so Keith CEO, and I was the publisher.  I went from ad director to, to publisher.  I reported to a gentlemen John Rollins, you know I will still work with 'til this day.  And you but it, it was very, you know we were running our own business.
Speaker 1: So as people who wanted to be entrepreneurs, you're running a company but you're not owning it at this point, are you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Keith did have equity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I had little sort of not even equity but you know I would get something you know if it was ever sold.  But Keith had small equity but it wasn't enough that we really felt that we were fulfilling that mission in our, within ourselves.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so making good money.  Part of an exciting thing, but that you know we, we are never deemed ourselves as good employees.  And so--
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: 'Cause we wanted to be entrepreneurs.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I mean that was just you know, that was the plan, you know.  And so Vibe allowed a, a--there was a definitely you're running the business.  There was nobody looking over your shoulder.  But we were profitable too so it was really like hey, whatever you're doing keep doing it.  But there was a sense that we needed to own more.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know I certainly did and Keith felt that way and so we talked about it and, and you know Keith approached Bob [Robert L. Miller] and Quincy [HistoryMaker Quincy Jones] and said, "Look, we sort of need to have more skin in there, you need some more"--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and at that time it wasn't felt that that was you know the direction that they wanted to go and so we decided to quit.  You know we, we put a plan together that we were gonna buy a series of magazines--
Speaker 1: When, when is this?
Speaker 2: This is in '98 [1998] and '99 [1999].  We left in September of '99 [1999].
Speaker 1: So now just set the stage Vibe was profitable, it was doing well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Vibe was making about ten thousand dollars a year profit, is doing well.  We lucky.  You, you couldn't have asked and it got you know got better after we continue to grow for a little bit after we left.  I mean it was on its ascension.  And you know we're making good money you know bonuses, you know, travel.  You know.
Speaker 1: And at this point, is, are you married at this point?
Speaker 2: Nope.  Nope.  I'm single.
Speaker 1: Keith?
Speaker 2: Keith is married to [Gia Clinkscales].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Keith is married and you know it--short of truly having your own business you really couldn't have asked for much more--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --at that time you know.  But that's you know again going back to you know my upbringing, my, you--know I think Keith as well our sense of where, where we're going to be.  That being in that situation would not have allowed that to blossom.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: And so in, in sometime in '99 [1999] you know Keith went in and resigned.
Story_ID: 656873
Speaker 1: We had a plan to raise money to go buy magazines or some magazines that are out there that come up after Vibe, Honey magazine, XXL magazine or sort of you know hovered below well where The Source was.  And so that's what we decided to do.  And so you know so I said hey you know let's go.  So I resigned.  And then we went to go raise money.  And we, we found some money that Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] developed relationship with a, a, an investment, investor.  And so we had went through the process and of identifying and money to go buy Honey and XXL magazine.
Speaker 2: And at this point Honey has been around for how long?
Speaker 1: I think they had done two issues.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Only two issues.  XXL had been around for a while and Harris Publications [Harris Publications, Inc., New York, New York] owned them.
Speaker 2: And, and just can you, can you explain what these magazines were?
Speaker 1: So Honey magazine was sort of a younger, cooler Essence.  You know Essence again was the, is the and still is the definitive magazine for African American women and but by and large it reaches you know from it's for as soon as you start reading magazines to you're not reading 'em more as a black woman, you're gonna read Essence you know.  And so and you looked in the general market space, there were a plethora of magazines of that just spoke specifically to young adult women, you know Elle and Nylon and you know the list goes on, right.  Glamour.  And then they had the other magazines that were you know really more for an older audience.  And we felt you know hey if there's Essence for our audiences there should be the Elle for our audience as well.  And that's what (background noise) Honey represent.  It was cool, it's fresh.  It was a lot of fashion.  It, it embraced hip hop you know in a way that was from a woman's perspective where at that moment in time Essence was you know I won't say anti hip hop but that wasn't where their--they didn't embrace that per say.  And so we felt that was a hole in a donut we could fill.  And XXL we felt we didn't need to be as big as Vibe but we could do half as good as Vibe with XXL you know we'll do fine.  So we had gone out and we had raised money so you know, know Keith and I both had left and but we didn't have employment contracts and which was good and we didn't owe Vibe anything in terms of what we would or would not do competitive news wise.  So we were like hey we're gonna--our goal was to go get these magazines and we're gonna bring Vibe down or maybe we'll come back and buy Vibe but we're gonna you know, we're gonna eat their lunch.  (Background noise) So we left, raised money and it was July 4th weekend and so--
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Ninety--2000.  It was more like 2000.  It might no, it might have been '99 [1999] now that I think about it.  And there were people that worked with us you know that we hired and so we knew we had a staff that we're gonna build and you know I was gonna hire some people that worked at Vibe and so we went and actually hir- and like four, three or four sales reps quit and came to work for us.  And so that was a little tumultuous.  And so we had raised this money but we hadn't you know, it hadn't totally been signed, funded and it's July 4th weekend and it's me, Keith another gentlemen Bo Kemp and no we're sitting there and we found out that they decided not to do the deal.  They decide not to do the deal.  Which in and of itself was bad, but what really made it bad is there were like four guys that quit their jobs to come work with us.  So fortunately the, the investors did--gave us a little bit to--basically give us--had given us a bridge loan to sort of carry us a little bit.  And--
Speaker 2: The ones who weren't going to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) who, who backed out to fund the full you know several millions of dollars.
Story_ID: 656874
Speaker 1: And then we went out and started hunting to find more money.  And so we found a, a gentlemen, Fred Terrell [HistoryMaker Frederick Terrell] and company Provender [Provender Capital Group LLC] who--private equity firm who believed in what we were trying to do and Fred said, "Okay, cool, I'm gonna give you enough money to go buy--," there's a business called Impact.  Impact music conference--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know.  And it wasn't gonna cost a lot of money but you know so he gave us some money to do that.  And he says, look you know Honey I, I, like it you know and XXL but you know if I was gonna do that I need somebody else to come along with us to put money in.  And so Honey's the one we really wanted you know.  We thought that that was where we could really do a great job and so we felt that you know we could partner with maybe Essence.  And maybe they could give us a loan you know invest and how great would that be you know and so we, (laughter) so we went and met with them.  Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] actually met with them.  And, and so they're like hey you know didn't fit, wasn't right story.  You know we had signed NDAs [non-disclosure agreement] and everything with and exclusiveness with Harrison [sic.] for Honey and we hadn't left the meeting we get a call from Harris Publication [Harris Publications, Inc., New York, New York] and say, "Hey, well Essence called about maybe looking at buying Honey."  (Laughter) So, so Fred, our investor, was like, "Well heck I'm a put all the money in.  Let's go."
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So then he gives the money to buy Honey.  So that was sort of the start of Vanguarde [Vanguarde Media].  You know we had Honey magazine and Impact and we're doing our thing and really our idea was to do some of you know hey, let's you know go out and get more advertising, let's build out the brand beyond just the magazine you know.  You know at Vibe we were the--Vibe was the second music magazine--second magazine on the web you know period.  The first magazine on the (air quotes) World Wide Web was Mother Jones, Vibe is the second.  And wasn't because me and Keith per se but we had a gentlemen that worked for us who was digital guru at that time and--
Speaker 2: Who was that?
Speaker 1: Chan Suh who went on to start agency.com and made a lot of money and you know does well, but he put us on the World Wide Web.
Story_ID: 656875
Speaker 1: But all that being said, you know, we knew hey let's get these businesses on the Internet.  Let's, let's you know see what's happening?  And so we're out there just, just doing our thing.  And but you know our sights are always on growing a business.  We saw Vanguarde [Vanguarde Media] being a, a, we thought that you know the idea of being one magazine that reaches everybody, is not where the business was going.  You know, we're not, we're not a monolithic group.  You know as African Americans, we're subsets that are very urgent and should be targeted.  So through the years actually we're in Baltimore [Maryland] we met Mr. Johnson, Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson], who at one point you know he asked us to come work.  You know Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] going to circulation or something 'cause we--they--Bob and BET [Black Entertainment Television] owned two magazines at the time Heart and Soul and YSB.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Remember that?  Young Sisters and Brothers.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, of course, you know we're like no, no, no, we're entrepreneurs.  So fast forward we're out trying to raise money.  And but then at the same time, Bob you know unbeknownst to us at the time, is about to sell BET.  So we, so Keith, you know he had, he had the great relationship, has a great relationship with Bob and they were talking and so basically the idea with Bob was like, hey, Emerge. I say, yeah Emerge magazine, Heart and Soul and YSB.  "I'm gonna give you guys that business.  I'm a invest money into the business and y'all figure it out which way to do it, you know.  Whether you decide to shut it down, do whatever, but that's all gonna be on your books and you do that."  And well prior to doing it he said to Keith specifically.  He said, "Well why don't you come work with me?  Why you doing all this?  Come work with me."  And Keith was like, "No this is what I wanna do, this is what I wanna do.  Me and Lenny [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.] are doing this."  So I, we--you know he gives us the business, invest a lot of money you know.  So we, we, we, we shut down YSB didn't think that was really a brand.  We are changing Emerge to Savoy [HistoryMaker] Roy Johnson's you know vision to give more of a lifestyle (background noise).  Really Savoy is the precursor to Uptown to be honest.  And Heart and Soul we thought it was a good, hey young adult is for--is Honey and Heart and Soul is for you know an older woman, that lifestyle (unclear) and those are great platforms.
Speaker 2: And Savoy had attempted to launch 'cause I had worked with Roy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah so Roy had done a--I don't think it was a test issue, but a--what they call it at the time a mock prototype--
Speaker 2: They never--
Speaker 1: --prototype.
Speaker 2: They never--
Speaker 1: Launched it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never launched it, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  He just did a prototype that really showed what it's all about to the media--
Speaker 2: At Time Inc.?
Speaker 1: At Time Inc.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: At Time Inc., Time Inc.  So, so we were like hey we, what Roy was trying to do with Savoy really we felt was where that the lifestyle element and talking to a more affluent culture was the way to go.  And so we bought the businesses.  Shut down YSB.  Changed Emerge to Savoy which drove Mr. Curry [HistoryMaker George Curry] crazy.  And then moved everybody and Heart and Soul to New York City [New York, New York].  And you know it was a very expensive transition, but Bob had given us money to do that.  And but then, but we also felt it was gonna be great opportunities (background noise) to do stuff with BET.  Television shows, circulation, you know ads, blah, blah, blah and about a month later, Bob sold BET to Viacom [Viacom Inc.] for $3 billion.  So, so he was a great investor but the synergies weren't gonna be there 'cause and you know at that time it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was pretty like magazines were not really the way to go.  And but that's how we got Heart and Soul and that's where Savoy came from.
Story_ID: 656876
Speaker 1: Bob had invested, Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson] had invested in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Vanguarde Media--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --giving you these publications--
Speaker 2: They were losing money (laughter).
Speaker 1: --and then what happens after he sells BET [Black Entertainment Television]?  Are you still in business with him?
Speaker 2: Technically, yes.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: He, he's a partner along with Provender Capital [Provender Capital Group LLC] and--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --Fred Terrell [HistoryMaker Frederick Terrell] and but now he, he's, he's on to bigger and better things for sure.  He is not a big believer in magazines per se.  And so, but, but Provender and Fred his partners, Derek Jones and others say they put you know kept putting money into the business.  So the good news was--is that we, we so we lost money, you know.  But as magazines do, and there was the ebb and flow of you know of okay so you do a business plan.  You say I'm gonna lose this much money and it's gonna take this many years to be profitable.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then your investors like, "Okay well I need you to lose," you know, "cut that in half in terms of how much you're gonna lose and I need you to do it quicker."  And you do.  You say all that, I'll give you the money.  (Laughter) So, so you're sort of like and you know we got into okay I mean you know we need the money.  Hey, if everything goes right, we can do it, but that means everything's gotta go right and that's a rare case then it happens.  But we went from losing you know fourteen million [dollars] to and to losing seven million [dollars] to losing like a little under three and so literally you know we were on the verge of being profitable.  I think what, what and we would have been profitable next year I think that, that one of the things that we learned it is unfortunate you know particularly for us in media and our space, you know, in, in the general market when you launch a new magazine, there's an excitement.  And there's a feeling amongst advertisers hey, let me mark my spot.  So I don't know whether or not it's really gonna be successful or not.  But I like the idea.  (Background noise)  I see where potential can be.  So you know let me commit to advertising and support you now so that if you are successful, I'm there in the beginning, I get all the benefits of that.  And if you're not, so what.  I spent a couple hundred thousand dollars in advertising against this you know $7 million of budget, big deal.  In our space, it's like well, I'm already invested in this, in these other magazines, Ebony, Essence and Black Enterprise, I'm not so sure that there needs to be another magazine for black people like this.  Are you gonna be around?  Do you have investors?  So you know what, I like--so, so the first year it's like oh, okay well I can't see this year, come back next year.  The next year it's okay I see, I like what you're saying all right come back next year, I'll give you an RFP [request for proposals].  And then you know typically you don't get the business that year, you get the business after.  Well by that time you're like on E, right?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And so you know with few exceptions that's the conversation.  And don't get me wrong, there were clients to really get on the black ad agencies and things like that, that were very supportive.  And so you know we'd go from you know fourteen to seven to three, but now people they're drinking the coffee.  They're drinking the Kool-Aid.  They see what's happening.  You know we've got, we, we've got you know we got great brands, great editorial, great events, digital.  You know we're, we're always pushing the envelope.  And we don't see ourselves as a magazine, we see ourselves as brands.  And clients, if you wanna--how can you participate in this brand?  You just wanna do a party, you know ads, we can figure that out.  Wanna do digital and no print, that's cool too.  Hey can we come up with a whole new marketing campaign for you?  We can do that too.  So we, we were there.  And then but unfortunately we were--it all didn't happen in time you know.  You know Provender put all the money that they could put in, couldn't find another investor that could sync up with what Provender and all of us wanted as, as for their investment.  And so, in 2000, November of 2003, week before, week of Thanksgiving, they, they put us into bankruptcy.
Story_ID: 656877
Speaker 1: That's what and that's how--
Speaker 2: I know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Uptown came about.  It's like what you're doing is not.
Speaker 2: (Pause) So you said that in November of 2003 you had to declare bankruptcy for Vanguarde Media.  Now from the outside people were very surprised--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --because it appeared as if these magazines were thriving.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  And they were as a current business at that moment.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It, but all the things that sort of lead up to that you know and look you know Fred Terrell [HistoryMaker Frederick Terrell] specifically and Provender [Provender Capital Group LLC], they invested a lot of money you know into the business to the tune of $30 million.  And so that, that was--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: So, so the idea of you know one having more powder in the gun to go back and get some more money and then two you know how were you gonna get that 30 million back.  Now we had a story in a, a track where we felt were  the one who could do that but you know while I don't believe putting it into bankruptcy was the right thing to do, I, I see Fred's--I understand where Fred was coming from in terms of I don't wanna put any more money in it like this.  So there's, I think there was a different way we could have handled it, but that's what happened.
Speaker 2: So going into bankruptcy meant what?  What did that do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That meant that everybody that was employed there was immediately laid off.  Kept on a very I don't even call a skeleton staff.  They ceased (background noise) publishing.  And that was that.  No, no two weeks' pay or, or severance.  It was at Thanksgiving you know.  It was you know, it was, it was bad that it was at Thanksgiving you know for everybody 'cause it's a holiday and that was tough.  For me it was, it was all bad, but it was good because I go home to my family's--to my parents' [Charlotte Carter Burnett and Leonard Burnett, Sr.] house for Thanksgiving.  And there was probably no place better for me to be at that time.  And so it's very heart wrenching.  You know the people that you work with.  First of all, they all worked very hard.  The way our business has always been set up you know, you know, your work life and your, you know, after work life all blend together.  So these people were not employees, they're our friends.  You know like we, we work hard.  We play hard.  You know, we have relationships.  We're, we're--it's, it's a, it's truly a family.  And so it hurts that much more because you're letting people down that are you know friends and family.  But then also that, you know, blindly our, you know and not stupidly, but blindly and with faith following you to you say, let's go through the wall, we're going through the wall.  And it, it is team Vanguarde and we're, we're doing--and then too for, for us to come up short on that promise of us, of greatness, you know it, it hurt you know, it hurt, but it really hurt more because you know I'm letting a bunch of people down.  Not--yeah.
Speaker 2: Was it, was it sudden for you, for you and Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] that the bankruptcy was happening?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it, sudden not like it happened a day that we didn't know what's happening.  It was we knew that was a possibility.  We really didn't feel that that would happen because that's sort of like the--you know you know there are a couple of other ways that it probably should have happened.  I mean you should never stop publishing, running a business if you're gonna think you can still try to sell it.  Which was what was the thought.  So you'd been better off firing me and Keith and a bunch of other people and just still sort of figuring it out 'til you could.  But again you know that's, so it wasn't--so we, we were out trying to raise, we knew how much money we needed to raise.  We had, we thought we found a couple different opportunities you know private investors, another private equity firm, another media, black media company that you know these were all options that we felt it may not have turned out totally smooth but we could have saved people's jobs or you know we felt Savoy was a great brand.  We felt you know Honey, all of them were great brands.  And they could fit well somewhere.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we didn't feel, our ego wasn't in a place where you know we'd rather see the business continue to grow and thrive than whether or not we were still owning and running it.  And so, so yeah, so we, we didn't think that would happen 'cause that was the worst, worst case scenario, but that's what ultimately happened.
Story_ID: 656878
Speaker 1: And so with bankruptcy, the publications were sold at auction, correct?
Speaker 2: So they, yeah, yeah, they go into bankruptcy and then they try to see if someone buy them as is and then, so then you can do a work out but then if that didn't happen they, they sold it.  They would sell them at auction.  And whatever proceeds were gotten, received from auction, they would distribute that back to the creditors.
Speaker 1: So basically at this point, you had Honey, Heart and Soul, Savoy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Savoy and Impact.
Speaker 1: --and Impact and then you had nothing.
Speaker 2: Zero.  Zero.
Speaker 1: So what did you do?
Speaker 2: So I was--it on Thanksgiving.  My wife [Burnett's ex-wife, Marsha Reid Burnett] at the time was pregnant.  So I go home and I'm you know I'm crushed.  I'm like what the heck.  What, what am I going to do.  And a couple of things happened that I recall.  So one it was, it was good to be home with mom and dad [Charlotte Carter Burnett and Leonard Burnett, Sr.], you know.  You can't do any wrong with them.  Of course my mother and father you know now when I was younger we didn't go to church a lot but now he goes church every Sunday you know.   Where's he's at church so they drag me to church just like I was a kid.  And the preacher gives a sermon that you know he was talking to me, you know.  And he just talked about there was this story about a, a donkey that had fallen in a hole and it couldn't get back up through the hole and then you know how's he gonna get out but then he, he would you know would kick down the dirt and stomp it up and he just kept stomping it until the point where the dirt rose up and he got out the hole.  I was like he's talking to me, you know.  So that inspired me.  I mean and I knew I wasn't never gonna be a quitter but that was just sort of like okay you know little tears coming down.  Like okay, all right, you know this--I had sulked for a little bit, but let's get it together.  And so then another thing that was very amazing just to show you about the--you know, 'cause you, you know everybody's pretty competitive in the business and at that time in particular, a little less now.  You know there was and there was sort of support here and there you know from Black Enterprise at times.  And you know, but it was very like we were all sort like crabs in a barrel.  Like the only way you could really succeed if someone else didn't quite make it.  So we, you know we, we were doing Vanguarde [Vanguarde Media] when we shut down.  We were doing as all the business combined you know high mid $20 million in revenue.  So when that shut down, there was--in, in all the other media's perspective, it's a free for all.  You know that $20 million is gonna go to us.   So but I got a call from Bernard [Bernard Bronner] at Upscale magazine.  And he, he said, "Look I know I am sorry to hear what happened.  I know you guys you and Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] are gonna figure it out and you know what I'm a offer to do is to, you know, pay your--give your sales reps you know a salary or stipend until you guys figure it out.  And you know they can help, they can maybe help some get ads in Upscale and you know that way I know when you come off the, out the abyss you still have your--
Speaker 1: (Cough).
Speaker 2: --team intact."  'Cause we, we had--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --we had a dynamic sales organization.  I mean.  And so I was, you know I was always very thankful for that you know.  I know Bernard wanted to make sure he get some of the twenty-five million [dollars] into his--that was cool, but I was--he was--I'm always to this day very grateful from that.  But, but so hey we you know Keith and I are fighters and so our thought was okay we'll buy the magazines out of bankruptcy.  That's what we'll do.  We'll go raise money to go buy it out of bankruptcy.  And so we spent you know an awful lot of time and put some money in that you know helped get the attorneys and things like that to try to buy out of bankruptcy.  And gave it a good, good shot.  But as time wore on, I sense that that could potentially happen but you know it'd been a little bit of a longshot.  Then like I said my wife at the time was pregnant with our first child [Leonard Burnett III] and I'm thinking like okay I, I had a good run as entrepreneur, you know.  But now I'm forty something, forty-one, forty, forty, thirty-nine, forty.  I gotta, gotta get a job.  So you know got a call from a headhunter, interviewed, talked to somebody at Time Inc.  And I thought I had--was gonna work for a magazine.  I'd, I'd work for Essence or something like that would be fun you know.  Great brand and--
Speaker 1: And at this point, is Essence under the Time Inc. umbrella (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now Essence is under Time Inc. umbrella.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes they been sold 50 percent.  And so I had, had a meeting from someone over from Essence which is great.  There--and, but in talking to them, it, you know it was good but I was like but, but listening to what they had to go through in dealing with Time Inc. and just all this, you're in this corporate, you, you--what I never had to play is the corporate game.  I just, we just shot straight and whatever was there, you know, but I didn't understand--haven't worked in Corporate America before, you know there's politics and nuances that you gotta you know.  So I was listening to her and I was like you know I can't do this.  You know I, I can't.  I, I, I just can't.
Story_ID: 656879
Speaker 1: So I, I was fortunate enough that I bought a brownstone in Harlem [New York, New York] back in the mid-'90s [1990s] when they were not giving 'em away but you know almost and so I had a lot of equity in my home.  Marsha [Marsha Reid Burnett], who's my, now ex-wife, was always very supportive at least at that time.  Always supportive.  And I was like look I wanna, I have an idea.  I wanna do something.  And so I mortgaged the house and decided to start Uptown magazine.  At the time, there were you know they were called these sort of niche magazines or publications were (unclear) but there were very successful, you know modern luxury, niche media, the Hamptons magazine, Gotham you know, ChicagoStyle [ChicagoStyle Weddings], et cetera.  We had all these magazines out there doing very well.  There were regional titles.  But it was nothing that spoke to us as affluent African Americans.  And I would tease you know Jason [Jason Binn] then you know Niche Media I was like, hey if we didn't know any better I'd look in your magazine the only hot, cool, black people were athletes or celebrities, you know.  We got doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, you know.  And Jason's a good guy.  It was just a, a joke.  And so I said I'm gonna start a magazine that sort of under this niche model.  They're a little different.  So I'm a start Uptown as a, as a national magazine with regional additions.  And so Brett Wright, who is my partner, who I'd known for you know twenty years who was around when we launched Vibe and worked at Uptown Records and ran RCA Records and a couple of other businesses.  He had an ad agency called Nu America [Nu America Agency, New York, New York] which is where we're at tod- this is the building where it was.  And so I said look you know we have this idea.  He agreed with the idea.  You know I said look so well if you have all this office space hey I'll come work outta here, we'll be partners you know.  He had done some custom magazines for me in the past.  Brett has a very good eye and aesthetic in taste and so he said we're partner up and we'll do this magazine called Uptown.  And you know we'll use other resources and some cash that you have along with the cash I have, we'll make this thing come out.  And then so we decided to do Uptown magazine.  And I thought that everything was sort of falling into place.  You know I got the money.  Met a young lady, Myiti Sengstacke [Myiti Sengstacke Rice], who had done newspapers and so she wanted to do something similar.  And so she was good hearted and wanted to help out.  And, and then I don't know if I can just sort of (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You can.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, yeah and so, so we have this magazine that we're gonna do called Uptown and it was, it was coming together.  I had a real vision at what it was supposed to be.  You know a design and a--and our space you know for the most part the magazine is a very word heavy, very basic design you know and I felt that you know all the consumers want something very visual and something that looked like lux and luxury, luxurious.  And so the content wasn't quite right and but yeah I said we'll fix it as we go.  And look and I think that I really believe as I mentioned a little bit earlier I believe in faith.  I do believe, I believe in God.  I believe that everything happens for a reason and I've learned to and through all these things I'm telling you are, what I do is I appreciate the journey.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I don't, I don't sweat, I lose some sleep at night but I don't worry.  I never feel there's not gonna be okay.
Story_ID: 656880
Speaker 1: So as fate would have it in this particular experience, I'm in the grocery store going shopping--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I run into you, [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So I'm thinking this ain't quite right, the ad is not quite right.  And I'm like boom, like, like, "Hey, Harriette, what are you doing?  What are you up to?  What are you doing?  So here's, I'm gonna do this magazine called Uptown and like you know you're perfect.  Like you, you get it.  I know you get it."  And you know Harriette of course you said okay well I'm doing this, I'm doing that.  Like I can help out a little bit.
Speaker 2: I just had a baby [Carrie Chinsee].
Speaker 1: You just had a baby, that's right you just had the baby and so I was like all right we just gotta get her doing something, and she'll, she'll run with it.  And so sure enough you came on board and really set the tone--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --for the aesthetic and the editorial vision.  You, you truly translated what we're, what was in Brett [Brett Wright] and I's head into the magazine.  And so we were you know we were publishing this magazine.  You know I mortgaged my house.  I started living off that.  I, I, you know we were getting advertising but you know not a lot you know.  You know 100,000 an issue was a big deal.  And during this time we're talking about faith, I you know, you know money would come and go.  And so but when, when money got low I could always sort of see where the next set of money was gonna come from.  That's what it always been for the last year or two.
Speaker 2: So you, and you didn't get investors for--
Speaker 1: No, this was me and Brett's money.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mortgaged my house.  Brett gave, put up some cash and he also used the, the revenue that he had in his business to fund and we'll use resources from his business.  So we weren't paying rent you know and we're using his designers, designing magazine and you know everything.  So I could always see where the money is coming from.  But this was 2005 and it was May, April and May--
Speaker 2: Well the magazine launched in--
Speaker 1: --in 2004.
Speaker 2: --four [2004], right.  So now you're at 2005.
Speaker 1: Two thousand five [2005] and I don't know where, I got like you know five, six thousand dollars in my bank account.  And enough to pay the mortgage in May and I don't know where the next dollars are coming, I just don't know, you know.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So I was worried about it.  I'm thinking about it and you know and so the May's mortgage is due.  So I say I can pay the May mortgage and I ain't got no money left.  Or I'll just not pay May's mortgage 'cause I got some money.  I can make sure I can feed my family and you know it's gonna take at least three months to throw me out the house and that's, that's a lifetime.  I can figure it out between you know three months.
Story_ID: 656881
Speaker 1: And so lo and behold the middle of May I get a call from Bob Miller [Robert L. Miller] who was still owned, who still owned Vibe and he says, "Hey Leonard [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.], how's it going?"  I said, "Great."  He said, "So you tired of being entrepreneur?"  "No, can't say I'm tired of it, no."  He said, "Okay that's okay.  So what are you doing?"  I told him about you know Uptown.  He said, "I've seen it."  And he said, "So well I was thinking that you know would you be interested in coming back and becoming the publisher of Vibe?"  And I'm like, "Oh, okay," and you know, "We're paying you know, here's how much money I'm paying," and I said, "Well Bob, I, I--look, I love working with you and obviously you know my affinity for Vibe but I can't leave Brett [Brett Wright] and Uptown what I've, you know what I've started here to you know to do that."  And so he says, "Okay, I'll tell you what, how much money do you think you need to sort of run the business and maybe hire someone to replace you as a publisher, as a head sales guy?"  So I told him the amount of money I thought we needed and he said, "Okay.  I tell you what, come work with me at, at Vibe, I'll give you this money you know.  You go out and hire somebody, and you know my goal is for us to go to buy Vibe.  You know 'cause it's gonna come up for sale.  You'll be part of that team and then you know we'll probably pull Uptown in underneath that as well you know when that happens."  Perfect.  So jokingly told him--so went out and hired Jocelyn Taylor, who's, who's the second publisher of Uptown who did a terrific job--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --for many years.  You know represented the brand--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --extremely well.  I went over to Vibe.  I told Brett, I said look hey listen, here's what's happening.  I'm, I'm taking a little row boat dingy off the island where we are and I'm a go find the land.  (Laughter) I'm a find land.  I'll be back though (laughter).  I'll be back.  So, so he said all right, yeah, yeah.  So you know so I went on you know so I started working with Kenard Gibbs [HistoryMaker Kenard E. Gibbs] and Bob at Vibe.  And you know so the idea was that, so I was so--and then asked when do you need me to start?  He was like, "Can you start in June?"  I was like, "Bet."  You know so God saved the day again.  And then so we're like okay cool and just about another twelve to eighteen months Vibe will come up for sale.  We'll put together, we have our team, management team.  We'll go out raise money and buy Vibe.  Great.  Well by July, they invest--the people that owned Vibe decided to sell it. The private equity company said we're ready to get out.  So, so we put together our team and you know we sort of had first dibs and we went around trying to raise money for that and you know found some money.  But there was a idea that Vibe was worth a lot of money to our current investor.  They thought then as it turned out it wasn't worth the money that they thought.  So it took a minute to sell.  Took a full year.  And then as it turned out they did not sell it to our team.  They sold it to another management team, that I then became part of.  And that was that you know.  And so they knew that I still had Uptown.  We're still sort of chugging along and--
Speaker 2: This is, this is the Wicks Group [Wicks Group of Companies, LLC, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: This is the Wicks Group, yeah, the Wicks Group.  And so they put up, they bought the business for $34, $35 million.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: So doing that.
Story_ID: 656882
Speaker 1: And you know one of the things I learned in life through all these different businesses is that you really can tell the direction a business is gonna go within the first ninety days.  Like you, you can tell.  Like is it gonna go outta here?  Sputter along?  Or is it really gonna just tank?  And so within the first ninety days I really sense that at best it was gonna sputter along.  You know the partners were all bright.  They you know had different visions.  Didn't all quite sync up and---
Speaker 2: What year is this now?
Speaker 1: This is 2006.  And--
Speaker 2: So has the cultural landscape changed?  Or is it really just business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.  Well, well primarily the business changed.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I mean culturally you know urban was still as important as ever and certainly there had been a little downsizing of sorts.  But the advertising had started to shift out of print to digital.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Some of the advertising was very supportive in the past that you know other mags just couldn't count on.  Such as music and fashion, urban fashion.  That went away.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, isn't it true, so iTunes was becoming important?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: So the way that music was sold was different.
Speaker 1: Well it was really true yeah and the, the people weren't buying music.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It was just--
Speaker 2: And music stores were closing down (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, everything was, yeah.  And so the need to market the way you marketed music totally changed.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that advertising went away.  The LDA [legal drinking age], the liquor laws and the smoking laws changed.  So those tobacco and liquor advertising went away.  Corporate businesses were under duress.  So that advertising went away.  So the business you know took a quick nose dive and the brand was still as important as ever and there were, you know my belief was it was really more about the brand less about the print but the equity investors were really like hey we just need to get more ad pages.  And I'm like that's not gonna come.
Story_ID: 656883
Speaker 1: And so, so anyway so after you know through this process, in 2007, I you know Bob Miller [Robert L. Miller] was still an investor and he had been meeting with another private equity firm about other things and I went on to meet with him about maybe just leaving to do something else you know.  And then it turned out there wasn't quite a fit for what we're talking about and then they just sort of asked well what else you working on?  And I told 'em about Uptown.  He said, "Hey you got a business plan on Uptown?"  I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, I think I got it."  I didn't have a business plan.  So went back me and Brett [Brett Wright] you know put together a little presentation and then in September of 2007, InterMedia Advisors [InterMedia Partners, LP, New York, New York] invested in, in Uptown and so it allowed me to quit working at Vibe and do Uptown full time.
Speaker 2: Now, while advertising was soft for Vibe, Uptown is a much smaller product.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: It was, was it still quarterly at this point?
Speaker 1: Still quarterly.  Well after the investors came it went up to six times a year.
Speaker 2: How was the ad landscape for, for Uptown?
Speaker 1: It, it was still tough.  But it was, but we were on a different model.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: See I think that the issue was particularly for Vibe was it was sort of on a, on a huge ocean liner and the landscape had changed so quick that, that being on that ocean liner you know being big was you know wasn't helpful any more.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And so when you, like you know you see steering a boat if you say turn right and you turn that, that wheel a hard right, it still takes a long time for that boat to actually turn right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Uptown was sort of on a dingy (laughter) you know.  And you know we're very nimble, we're small, we're efficient.  We could, we could adjust to the environment.  We were much more aggressive in our approach to, to getting advertising.  Jocelyn [Jocelyn Taylor], at the time was a great sales reps.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You know we didn't just sell ads, we sold events.  We sold integration.  We sold editorials.  We sold digital.  We sold everything.  And so we--and there was no one else talking to our audience.  So, our metrics of success was, were a little bit different and allowed us to you know continue and to, to grow as a business.
Story_ID: 656884
Speaker 1: As all of this is happening, where is Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales]?  Is Keith, Keith is (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So yeah, so Keith, Keith went on to consult first, he ended up going with ESPN, so he did that.  So after Vanguarde [Vanguarde Media] shut down, he eventually went on to consult with ESPN for years, a couple years; then went on to take a position full time, you know.  He ran the magazine, the books, and some production and had a successful career.  Came up with '30 for 30' was his idea and you know the magazines did well.  And then so that's where he was.
Speaker 1: And so did you all--because you, you had been in business together and really partnering from college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --did you consider working together after you left Vanguarde?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know well I mean while the goal originally was to buy Vanguarde back or buy one of those magazines back, then you know that faded.  That opportunity sort of faded away.  Keith needed to support his family you know so he began consulting, you know.  I didn't want to go--you know, I think if I wanted to, Keith would have said hey, there's an opportunity at ESPN but I didn't wanna do that.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And so you know, and I wanted to continue to be an entrepreneur and so the, so Keith, he and I to this day always still talk about one day working together again (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: And I'm sure we will.  But you know that was sort of our, the paths we took.
Story_ID: 656885
Speaker 1: So InterMedia Advisors [InterMedia Partners, LP, New York, New York] is who invested in--
Speaker 2: In, in Uptown.
Speaker 1: --in Uptown, but then didn't you also get Vibe?
Speaker 2: So, 2007 I put money in and then 2008, 2009, 2008 happened.  And you know the market changed.  I mean everything was upside down.  So it was a tough time for Uptown.  And my goal still--I, I think it's, it's very difficult to be a single title publisher business.  That's not, it's a slow; it's just a tough, tough way to do it.  And so my goal was to always have multiple businesses or publications.  And, and there's obviously I felt that there was some unfinished business at Vibe primarily in yet again less to do with the magazine but all the things that Vibe could be you know a television show, license brand, content, so forth.  So I sort of kept my eye on that.  And I knew that, I knew the numbers you know I was gonna have a tough time.  And so 2008, 2009 you know starts going south and I talked to InterMedia about you know, you know, you know something is gonna happen at Vibe, let's, let's do Vibe.  And they were reluctant.  You know they're like look we need money and we got we need to keep.  But they had a bunch of businesses, you know, including 'Soul Train.'  We gotta keep focus on that.  And but then you know like some investors you know they like, they like the, the art of the deal.  And so we began conversations with, with Wicks [Wicks Group of Companies, LLC, New York, New York] about buying Vibe from Wicks.  So we thought we'd come close to the deal and then that didn't happen.  And then about weeks later, month later, they shut Vibe down.  Just like they did with Vanguarde [Vanguarde Media], shut it down.  Ceased the publishing.  Because again it was the wrong thing to do.  And so fast forward you know again Brett [Brett Wright] and I both were excited about the opportunity at Vibe.  How all the stuff would fit with Uptown?  And had a conversation with the, the bank who then owned the, you know because they had defaulted to the bank about buying, buying the debt.  And came up with a number and InterMedia you know they like to deal and they were supportive and we bought Vibe from the bank.  So now we have back with Uptown and Vibe for the third time.
Story_ID: 656886
Speaker 1: You decide to buy, to buy Vibe?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: That was in 2009.
Speaker 1: Okay now it's, it's closed.  You buy it from the bank.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So now you have two (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's my third.
Speaker 1: It's your third time?  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Third, this is the third time, yeah.  And InterMedia [InterMedia Partners, LP, New York, New York], our private equity firm, they've invested in, in the acquisition of that.
Speaker 1: And tell what happens as a result?
Speaker 2: So, so we know again we had, you know we knew digital was sort of the place to be sort of where he wanted to go it's less about print.  We you know cut the rate base down from where it was.  I think at that time it was from eight hundred thousand or half million to three hundred thousand.  We cut the frequency from ten times a year to six or four times a year.  And really invested in digital.  You know we've, we want build it a network of, of digital sales network.  But again for, for, for me and Brett [Brett Wright] in particular, we thought all that was good but it was about the brand, you know.  It was how to get into video content, licensing, television, the events.  That's where you know 'cause print and even digital to some degree where media was changing and the paradigm shift was changing.  So, so we, we had a couple other partners were put together a model again not atypical with private equity didn't quite mesh up with timing and the amount of money that you know it was always more than what, what they thought or willing to do.  You know the economy definitely hurt so you're putting together projections and you know you think you're adjusting enough for you know the downsized ad market, but it keeps getting worse.  And so then, you know, but again there's a belief that there's something there and there's also belief that there was a opportunity to say maybe aggregate other urban properties because again individually they were going--they were all hurting.  But how could we make these, you know come together?  So my--Magic Johnson and Ron Burkle from The Yucaipa [The Yucaipa Companies, LLC], they have a, had a firm together and they had interest in, in actually Ebony as well as maybe doing other media.  Now the Ebony deal didn't come through so they you know end up teaming up with InterMedia and deciding to put money in to invest in Uptown, Vibe primarily and 'Soul Train.'
Speaker 1: And when was this?
Speaker 2: That was in 2010.
Speaker 1: And now 'Soul Train' had been bought by Kenard Gibbs [HistoryMaker Kenard E. Gibbs], right?
Speaker 2: Kenard Gibbs and Peter Griffith.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And InterMedia Advisors funded that deal--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who are our partners as well.  They did their deal after our deal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so the same people are kind of hovering around each other.  You had worked with Kenard--
Speaker 2: I worked with Kenard on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Vibe.
Speaker 2: --at Vibe the first time and Vibe the second time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Kenard had gone on to be publisher of Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Publisher, yep.
Speaker 1: And left to (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Vibe.
Speaker 1: When you bought--?
Speaker 2: To buy 'Soul Train.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: With Peter, yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: So now you all are in business together?
Speaker 2: Well, we're not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, well, there's separate businesses but you know we're supposed to have synergies and by the same investors.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: So.
Story_ID: 656887
Speaker 1: So under Magic Johnson Enterprises [Magic Johnson Enterprises, Inc.] and Yucaipa [The Yucaipa Companies, LLC], they invest in your, in your now you have two publications.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What happens to your businesses from there?
Speaker 2: Again, it was still, still tough time in the marketplace.  We had some successes, you know; built larger traffic on our, on our website.  Advertising, you know, it was still stagnant you know some good months, some bad months.  But the model was to really grow the digital side of the business and what had happened to print in years earlier was starting to happen in digital.  And so what clients were looking forward to being bigger and bigger.  And while Vibe had grown, it wasn't--you know, had, had the network opportunity was sort of fading away.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And so you know the numbers were, were getting, the business was more and more you know under duress a little bit.  And but, everyone still felt there's a way out and how we're gonna keep, keep growing.  Because there were a lot of shining stars within that you know.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: The circ [circulation] was good in some areas.  The book looked good.  Some growth in certain categories of advertising you know.  And the brand was still as important as ever.  Events were becoming more and more, bigger part of the business.  And then, so then the, the investors want to sort of focus more on the digital play, brought on partners, a partner that had, had in theory more digital experience than, than we did.  Again, so long story short, that just didn't all mesh together.  Personalities, strategy and then so Brett [Brett Wright] left earlier in 2012 that year.  And then I left in, in probably September, October of 2012 and we bought Uptown back from our investors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So sort of worked out a deal where we could buy the brand back.  They can focus on Vibe.  And we'll focus on Uptown and, and grow our business from there.  And so that's what we did.
Speaker 1: And at this point this is 2012, you are back in business together--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --separate from--
Speaker 2: Vibe.
Speaker 1: --from Vibe and separate from your investors?
Speaker 2: From InterMedia [InterMedia Partners, LP, New York, New York], yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Bob Miller [Robert L. Miller] still part of our team.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you do have an investor?
Speaker 2: Well I mean Bob, well we, we didn't have any more.  Bob is just, he, he was part of our team--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --at that moment.  He didn't put any more money into Uptown but you know.
Speaker 1: So where is the money coming from at this point?
Speaker 2: We are eating what we kill.  I mean we're back, I'm back to 1999--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --you know.  And we are figuring it out. I do have a, there is a gentlemen, Michael Deutsch [ph.] who's an attorney who--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --who factors our money, that has been a partner really for years so we sort of you know working with him to put money in.  And you know we have a staff of people working at Vibe you know Henry Watkins our publisher, Robin Gibson, great sales rep, Bob Ingram [Robert Ingram], Cheryl Osmond [ph.], Molly Ballentine [ph.], same team many of those people that you know worked with me at Vibe in 1993 and/or certainly at Vanguarde [Vanguarde Media].  These are all people for when those first ten years--
Speaker 1: So they're still on your team?
Speaker 2: Still on my team.  And, and we're just, we're hustling you know.  And but we changed the strategy even more 'cause again we always believed in the brands more so than the print itself.
Story_ID: 656888
Speaker 1: So the company that sort of owns our business or our umbrella company is U Brands where we acquire and, or license underdeveloped brands that target underserved audiences.  And we put financial and, or human resources into the business to expand them across multiple platforms.  So from outside a print to digital, video content, mobile, events, television, licensing, you know we, we deploy our resources to expand those brands.  And so with Uptown you know we think there's all those opportunities.  We're actually in the process of building a hotel in Harlem [New York, New York] called Uptown House.  It's, it'll be like Soho House and members club [Soho House New York, New York, New York], roof deck, pool, restaurant, bar, forty-five room hotel.  We subsequently went on to and with Bob did invest, buy Hype Hair magazine--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --which is a twenty-one year old brand that is the number one magazine for African American women hair.  Built a huge website and around it, doing ecommerce, licensing, events, video content.  And you know working on other acquisitions that will again get us more into the event business in being an overall sort of multiplatform integrated media company that provides access to our clients to various facets of our culture and through various media platforms.  And so that's how we think we'll dominate and grow.
Speaker 2: So U Brand is a separate business?
Speaker 1: It's the umbrella company.  Sort of so that--
Speaker 2: And the owners of that are who?
Speaker 1: Myself, Brett Wright, and Bob Miller [Robert L. Miller].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this, this launched in what 2013?
Speaker 1: Well, now you--
Speaker 2: U Brands (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) U Brand, so when we left I mean there, well we technically, yeah in 2013 is when we sort of coined it as U Brands, yes 2013.  That's what sort of Hype Hair came up underneath that--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and that's how we laid it out, yes.
Speaker 2: So now what is U Brands doing?  What are you doing?
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Today?
Speaker 1: --so today we are you know focus on growing our two core businesses right now with Uptown and, and, and Hype Hair, really again outside of the, the magazine and even media into other facets.
Story_ID: 656889
Speaker 1: We also, which I'm very excited about, you know and I think life has always allowed me to participate and do things that are really germane to my lifestyle at the moment.  So I was twenty-eight years old, I had launched Vibe.  You know at thirty-eight years old, we did you know thirty (unclear) was thirty I was probably in my thirties we did Vanguarde [Vanguarde Media] you know which had all these properties.  At forty, I launched Uptown which was very much my lifestyle.  I have two beautiful children you know Lenny III [Leonard Burnett III] and Rani [Rani Burnett].  My daughter who's eight and you know what I noticed and talking with a friend is that there are a lot of blogs and sites focused on moms.  Everything from general market to Mocha Moms [Mocha Moms, Inc.] which is a great site for African American mothers and I didn't see anything that spoke to African American fathers.  And that, and more, and on top of that you know when you speak about African, black men and fatherhood, generally speaking, the first, that conversation is started from a negative standpoint about what we're not doing, that children are you know, absentee, that we're absentee fathers.  And the truth--and there, there is that for sure, but in my life as but a small slice but every father that--look I always tell, I tease.  I know some bad black boyfriends.  (Laughter) Know some bad not so good black husbands.  I don't know any bad black fathers.  Every, every person I know that is a father in, in my circle and others are hands on, active and terrific fathers.  So where is that platform for us?  And so again, faith and so I had, I had this meeting and in my head said I'm a start this website and platform for fathers of color.  And I'm gonna call it you know I'm thinking to myself I want it to be fun, I want it to be interactive.  It is not, it's not heavy handed serious.  Oh, so I came up with the name Notorious POP.  So I'm a start this site.  Then I randomly get a phone call from a young lady that I don't--I didn't answer the phone.  I just saw the number come up, 716 number.  I don't know anyone from that number.  Then something I don't do often, I listened to my voicemail message.  It was like hey, my name is Angela [ph.], I heard A and E [A and E Networks].  I do something with A and E and I wanna talk about doing something with Uptown this and that and the other.  I said oh A and E television, let me call her back.  This is Buffalo [New York].  I don't know, well I'll figure it out.  And so call her back and so she tells me say, "Hey look I love the brand, I like what you're doing.  I wanna see how I can contribute."  And I'm like, "Okay well tell me what you, what'll you do exactly?"  And she told me all the things she'd done and mentioning she said I did this.  I launched a website for A and E, A and E Moms [ph.].  You know I, I launched this and we did all this that the other blah, blah, blah. I said, "Okay."  I said, "Well all right listen, that one conversation you wanted to have about TV and stuff that, we can talk about that.  But I got something totally different."  Never met her before in my life.  I said, "All right here's this website I wanna start.  Here's what it is about, fathers of color.  I think it'd be great.  You obviously have some experience in doing this with moms since you know and would you like to do this with me?"  And there's silence on the phone.  And she says, "I think that's a great idea.  I'm in."  And so she sort of became the, she's the head debtor and chief and head of content--
Speaker 2: Great (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for Notorious POP which we launched in June for--during Father's Day.  Lexus came on as a partner and Family Dollar [Family Dollar Stores, Inc.] came on as a partner and you know we'll be doing video content, events, you know stuff like that.  So we did that.  And, and then you know we'll be acquiring a couple of events over the next couple months.  And so again to build this business that you know really allows us to talk to clients in various types of platforms and, and then you know the, the sort of the where we hope to go one day for sure is you know having not only being in television but to have a network.  So you know that's the holy grail I think for us.  That's what we're doing.
Story_ID: 656890
Speaker 1: So as you look at your career, what do you envision your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I would like to think that--look as, as black, well, well look if media really allows you to you know not shape, but really somewhat shape but really to chronicle you know our history and our culture.  And I am happy to have said that you know I had a very small piece in that through our various brands in the media that we helped to show a slice of that, that you know good and bad but certainly from our perspective and, and again, and, and not and showing that we're just not a monolithic group.  And so I think I feel very proud of being, to be able to participate in that.  'Cause certainly it is not a one man show by any stretch.  It's very much a team, team sort of, of effort.  And I think the other thing that I am very fond, or that I really appreciate is that I've always worked with friends.  You know I think there is you know, there is one argument to say that's oftentimes a recipe for disaster, but I always say hey business is business and friendship is friendship.  But I only do business with friends.  And so that my career you know whether it be Keith [HistoryMaker Keith Clinkscales] or Brett [Brett Wright] or again any and every person that sort of worked with us in some way, shape or form, has been a friend in my life.  So that what that means is that hey we have a common goal.  We're really involved in this business.  But you know we can argue and disagree and really go at it, but at the end of the day our friendship is going to resonate--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and allow us to even when we disagree, to move forward as a team and as friends.  And I've been blessed with that.  And the other thing that I think again it is not just, just me, it's, it's everything from you know that fact where Vibe started and Quincy [HistoryMaker Quincy Jones] and Time Inc. and Bob Miller [Robert L. Miller] and Keith and myself and Brett and others, that have you know in some way shape or form paved the way for an opportunity for people that look like us to have dynamic and great careers and vastly contribute to media overall you know.  Not just that the great you know black owned business media companies are out there like Ebony, Jet and Black Enterprise and BET [Black Entertainment Television] and TV One.  But Conde Nast you know Time Inc., Yahoo, you know Viacom [Viacom Inc.] you know there are people that work with us in all facets of the business that have gone on to some tremendous careers and to become entrepreneurs.  And in some way shape or form when you look back you know you, you, you, you'll see people, they're doing great things and they'll remember you know there--they were little kids when they worked with you or they you know they're like wow, they're, they're doing some really tremendous things.  And so I think that's the thing that I really most, really appreciate you know that you know it's, 'cause it's not hard it's very, I mean it's hard out here you know.  And you know and I think that you know not only did, did we help sort of some way help pave that way, but then once they got there, they really represented, you know.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And, and you know and hopefully they, they learned a little something from me and our, you know, our folks along the way to help 'em be successful.
Story_ID: 656891
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: Honestly, no.  I mean regrets is--no I don't have any regrets.  Would I've done things differently?  At different times?  Absolutely.  You know, but I don't have any regrets.  And that goes back to the idea of faith, that I really believe that everything happens for a reason.  I believed and what I really appreciate in my old age of fifty but then what I appreciate is the journey, you know.  I know success is built on steps of failure.  And that if you have faith you know in knowing that it's all gonna work out right, I then appreciate all the, the, the, you know the, the hurdles the, the delays, the, the, the tears, and 'cause I say okay this just part of that journey.  And so I'm, I'm gonna embrace what's happening now and learn from it.  You know whether it's excitement, disappointment whatever that is, and, and keep moving forward and know I will reflect upon that at various times in my career and life and that's to be something I can, that will fuel me you know.  Or at least I will learn from or I'll be inspired by or I'll know not to do.  And so I, so I don't, I don't regret anything.  I, I, I enjoy what I do.  I, I've not had a job since I worked at Baxter Healthcare [Baxter Healthcare Corporation]. I mean I just, it just never felt like a job.  I, there's never been a day I regret coming into work you know.  You know there days I'd rather be playing golf, but I don't regret, I don't have that sense of (makes sound) I don't like this.  And so that's a blessing you know and so, so that's, so no regrets.
Story_ID: 656892
Speaker 1: What does your father [Leonard Burnett, Sr.] have to say about your entrepreneurial path?
Speaker 2: He, you know, look he--he, he respects it and he's, he's proud of me.  I mean it's, it's definitely I remember I used to tell him to invest in different things or you know, but I knew I was okay so I, I bought, I bought property in Harlem [New York, New York], you know.  My first home in Harlem and didn't have the money to really do it at that moment and I said to my dad, I said, "Look you know can you loan me money to buy the house?"  He was like, "Boy, I didn't ask my dad [Booker Burnett] for money to buy my first house.  You know go, go figure it out."  And then I said, "Well look at it as a business deal.  Like look, this real estate is great.  And you know hey I'll give you a return on your investment."  He was like, "I'm not doing that."  So, of course, I went out and figured out a way to get a mortgage.  And I bought the house.  And I bought a couple of houses and that was one of the better things in my better investments in life.  And so one day my mom [Charlotte Carter Burnett] was on the phone with me years ago and she say, my dad, she said, "Hey your dad said to me one day, said, 'I should have listened to Lenny [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.] about buying them homes in Harlem,'" you know (laughter) (unclear) so I, so I sort of knew okay I'm, I'm part of the gang now.  He said like that and so but no he, he appreciates--he now has his own radio show.  Getting on a sports business radio show called 'Get In The Game With Len Burnett' [ph.].  And so I was, I--he interviewed me on his radio show which was fun.  And so, so yes, so it's great.
Story_ID: 656893
Speaker 1: What advice would you give to young people who might want to follow in your footsteps?
Speaker 2: So, so advice doesn't always mean what I actually did, but I would say this.  Truly--well first of all you know whatever you decide to get into, really study the business.  I mean really learn, you know, research, understand what you want.  I don't say you got to write a business plan, but at least do more--put some stuff on paper.  More than what, what we did.  And sort of map it out.  Be very passionate about what you do.  I mean absolutely passionate.  You know there's no room for to just sort of doing it you know, 'cause for the money.  You know if you're passionate about it and you like what you do, the money will come.  And you know again, you know put a good team around you.  To you know going at it alone, you know people can and sometimes that's your personality but having a great team is really you know what's really been part and parcel to my success (background noise).  And you know I, I, and, and, you know truly enjoy the moment and the, the journey.  And know that it's not gonna be easy.  And you know you, you gotta, you gotta have faith.  You know because whatever that is for you, you know I'm not saying and again I'm not like I say I'm not a holy roller.  I'm not, whatever you choose to, is gonna be that thing that you're gonna, is gonna be your guiding sort of star.  Keep that well in front of you and you know odds are you'll, you'll be successful.
Speaker 1: Very good.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: Cool, that was fun.
